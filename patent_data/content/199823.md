# MONITORING DEVICE FOR AN INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE.

## Abstract
A monitoring device for monitoring a relation between the screw position and the pressure in the injection molding machine in which a screw 29 is driven by a servo motor 27 . At the time of injection, addresses that are generated by an address generator 20 and that are renewed every moment are supplied to first and second memories 16, 18 via an address switching circuit 21 to specify addresses in the two memories 16, 18 . At the same time, output of a pulse counter 15 which indicates the screw position and output of an analog digital converter 17 which indicates the internal pressure in a metal mold 30 are stored in the first and second memories 16, 18 every moment. At the time of monitoring, values stored in the first and second memories 16, 18 are read out via the address switching circuit 21 that is switched, and a relation between the screw position and the pressure in the mold is displayed on a display device 25 .
