The compounds of the invention have been found to be useful as herbicides, especially as post emergent herbicides. The post emergence herbicidal activity of the various compounds of this invention is demonstrated by greenhouse testing in the following manner A good grade of top soil is placed in aluminum pans having holes in the bottom and compacted to a depth of 0.95 to 1.27 cm. from the top of the pan. A predetermined number of seeds of each of several dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous annual plant species and or vegetative propagules for the perennial plant species are placed on the soil and pressed into the soil surface. The seeds and or vegetative propagules are covered with soil and leveled. The pans are then placed on a sand bench in the greenhouse and watered from below as needed.After the plants reach the desired age two to three weeks , each pan except for the control pans is removed individually to a spraying chamber and sprayed by means of an atomizer operating at a positive air pressure of approximately 1.46 kg cmê absolute. The atomizer contains 6 ml. of a solution or suspension of the chemical and an amount of a cyclohexanone emulsifying agent mixture so that the spray solution or suspension contains about 0.4 by weight of the emulsifier. The spray solution or suspension contains a sufficient amount of the candidate chemical in order to give application rates corresponding to those set forth in the table. The spray solution is prepared by taking an aliquot of a 1.0 by weight stock solution or suspension of the candidate chemical in an organic solvent such as acetone or tetrahydrofuran or in water.The emulsifying agent employed is a mixture comprising 35 weight percent butylamine dodecylbenzene sulfonate and 65 weight percent of a tall oil ethylene oxide condensate having about 11 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of tall oil. The pans are returned to the greenhouse and watered as before and the injury to the plants as compared to the control is observed at approximately two and four weeks as indicated in the table under WAT weeks after treatment and the results recorded.

Preferably, the compositions of this invention contain from 5 to 75 parts by weight of at least one compound of this invention, together with the adjuvants. Where required, from about 0.1 to 2.0 parts by weight of the inert liquid extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or anti foaming agent, or both. The compositions are prepared by admixing the active ingredient with an adjuvant including diluents, extenders, carriers and conditioning agents to provide compositions in the form of finely divided particulate solids, pellets, solutions, dispersions or emulsions. Thus, the active ingredient can be used with an adjuvant such as a finely divided solid, a liquid of organic origin, water, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an emulsifying agent or any suitable combination of these. The herbicidal compositions of this invention particularly liquids and soluble powders, preferably contain as a conditioning agent one or more surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given composition readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorporation of a surface active agent into the compositions greatly enhances their efficacy. By the term surface active agent , it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents and emulsifying agents are included therein. Anionic, cat ironic and non ionic agents can be used with equal facility. Preferred wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, polyoxyethylene derivatives of phenols and alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the mono higher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g., sorbitan . Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium lignin, sulfonates, polymeric alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, polymethylene bisnaphthalenesulfonate and sodium N methyl N long chain acid taurates.

The application of liquid and particulate solid compositions to plants or soil can be carried out by conventional methods, e.g.., power dusters, boom and hand sprayers and spray dusters. The compositions can also be applied from airplanes as a dust or a spray because of their effectiveness at low dosages. There are several methods for applying liquid compositions of this invention to emerged plants. Such methods include the use of wiper systems whereby the plant to be treated is contacted with an absorbent material containing the particular liquid composition, a portion of which is thereby released onto the plant upon contact therewith. Such wiper systems typically comprise a reservoir of the liquid composition into which a portion of the absorbent material is placed and is fed therethrough. Generally, substances employable as absorbent material include substances of any shape or form capable of absorbing the liquid composition and releasing a portion of the same upon contact with the plant. Typical absorbent materials include felt, foam rubber, cellulose, nylon, sponges, hemp, cotton, burlap, polyester over acrylic, combinations thereof and the like.Forms of absorbent material include rope, twine, string, cloths, carpets, combinations thereof and the like. These forms may be assembled in any manner desired including a pipe rope wick, a wedge rope wick, a multi rope wick and the like. In another application method, liquid compositions may be selectively applied to weeds by the use of recirculating sprayer systems wherein the recirculating spray unit is mounted on a tractor or high clearance mobile equipment and the spray is directed horizontally onto the weeds growing over a crop. Spray not intercepted by the weeds is collected in a recovery chamber before contacting the crop and is reused. Roller applications may also be employed to apply liquid compositions to weeds growing over a crop. In yet another application method, shielded applicators may be employed to direct the liquid composition in the form of a spray onto the weeds while effectively shielding the crops from the spray. These and other application methods for selectively applying liquid compositions to weeds are discussed in detail in Innovative Methods ofPost Emergence Weed Control, McWhorter C.G., SouthernWeed Science Society, 33rd Annual Meeting Proceedings,Jan. 15 17, 1980 Auburn University Printing Service,Auburn, Alabama U.S.A., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Another method of applying liquid compositions of this invention to plants includes controlled droplet application which is also known as the ultra low volume chemical application. Controlled droplet application involves the production of uniform or nearly uniform spray drops of a predetermined size and the conveyance of these drops with negligible evaporation to a spray target. In particular, this method comprises feeding spray solutions to a rotary atomizer comprising a small disk with serrated edges that disperses liquid into droplets as the disk spins.Different droplet sizes are produced by changing solution flow rates to the spinning disk or changing the speed of rotation of the disk. The aforementioned and other methods for applying liquid compositions to plants are discussed in detail in Rope Wick Applicator Tool With A Future ,Dale, James E., pp. 3 4, The Recirculating Sprayer and Roundupt Herbicide , Derting, Claude W., pp. 5 7, and C.D.A. Herbicide Application , McGarvey, Frank X.,Weeds Today, Volume 11, Number 2, pp. 8 9, Late Spring, 1980, 309 W. Clark St., Champaign, Illinois, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The application of an effective amount of the compounds or compositions of this invention to the plant is essential and critical for the practice of the present invention. The exact amount of active ingredient to be employed is dependent upon the response desired in the plant as well as such other factors as the plant species and stage of development thereof, and the amount of rainfall as well as the specific glycine employed. In foliar treatment for the control of vegetative growth, the active ingredients are applied in amounts from about 0.112 to about 22.4 or more kilograms per hectare. An effective amount for phytotoxic or herbicidal control is that amount necessary for overall or selective control, i.e., a phytotoxic or herbicidal amount. It is believed that one skilled in the art can readily determine from the teachings of this specification, including examples, the approximate application rate. Although this invention has been described with respect to specific modifications, the details thereof are not to be construed as limitations for it will be apparent that various equivalents, changes and modifications may be restored to without departing from the spirit and scope thereof and it is understood that such equivalent embodiments are intended to be included herein.
