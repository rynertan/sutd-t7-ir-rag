# IMPROVED CARD FOR USE WITH ELECTRONICALLY APPROVED TRANSACTIONS

## Abstract
The card includes machine readable encoding for iden tifying the customer, e.g. a magnetic stripe on the back. The card 20 is rendered incapable of being embossed in an authentic looking manner. This impedes the ability of fraudulent users to alter the card, to avoid the necessity of obtaining electronic authorization. In one embodiment, the card is arranged to provide a visual indication to warn a merchant of an unauthorized alteration, e.g. by placing the signature panel 34 over the area which would be embos sed, or by printing a fine line pattern over this area or encapsulating ink beads in this area. In another embodiment, the card is formed from a material which resists deformation, e.g. metal or a brittle material.
