# HERMETICALLY SEALABLE PACKAGE FOR HYBRID SOLID STATE ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
A small component package employing a ring frame 11 of a mouldable polyamide imide thermoplastic directly moulded onto a heat conducting base plate 10 with integral moulded anchoring pins of the thermoplastic material engaging corresponding bores 21 and 22 through the base plate. The other edge of the ring frame 11 is metallized as is the interface area 13 with a cover plate 12 of the same thermoplastic material for a soldered seal. Multiple solid electrical leads 17, 18, 19, 20 are moulded into the ring frame 11 during the base plate to ring moulding operation to provide an inexpensive, sealed package which is also light in weight. Threaded inserts 14 facilitate a firm connection to an external heat sink surface along surface 10a of base plate 10.
