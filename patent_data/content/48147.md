# Wrap around device, method of enclosing a substrate using such a device and substrate so enclosed.

## Abstract
A wrap around device for enclosing at least part of an elongate substrate such as a pipe comprises a dimensional ly recoverable cover, preferably a dimensionally heat recoverable cover 2 having an adhesive closure arrange ment comprising two closure portions 3, 4 which can be brought into abutment to form an adhesive bond but which, when pulled in a direction away from each other after the adhesive bond has been formed, will change in configuration to form a lap joint. The device according to the invention enables an adhesive wrap around device to be installed about a subs trate in a simple manner without the possibility of misalign ment of the closure portions.
