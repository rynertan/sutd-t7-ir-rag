## Description
DESCRIPTION A CONTAINER FOR COLLECTING, PRESERVING, AND SERVING HOT BEVERAGESTechnical Field The present invention relates to hand held containers for dispensing hot beverages, and more specifically to a hand held and floatingly lidded container for collecting, preserving and dispensing beverages and other pourable comestibles. The preparation, storing and serving of such beverages as hot chocolate, coffee and tea or of such foods as bouillons and soups, present unique logistical problems which render most available vessels inadequate for the above stated purposes.Such well known containers as the ubiquitous coffee pot, or urns of traditional design can be efficiently employed to heat and serve a pourable comestible.The most significant problems are encountered when the above mentioned containers are used to maintain such products for prolonged periods of time. For example, coffee which is stored in traditional covered containers, oxidizes upon exposure to and interaction with the surrounding air. This interaction gives rise to off flavors, rendering the product unacceptable to consumer tastes. Loss of aro matic and desirable volatiles from the exposed surface of the liquid is also a detrimental factor.As the void between the upper level of the comestible and any stationary cover increases, the potential for exposure to outside atmospheric contamination increases as does the potential for the loss of endogenous volatiles. The problem of oxidation of and loss of volatiles from flowable foodstuffs, which must be kept, in a heated condition, for extended periods of time is well known in the art. In fact, there are several prior art references which disclose specific embodiments for enclosing a liquid foodstuff beneath a sealing member to prevent oxidation or contamination.U.S. Patent 551,540 discloses such an appliance that has a floating lid which seals liquid within a container U.S. Patent 1,948,353 shows a similar article, as does U.S. Patent, 3,804,635. U.S. Patent 3,987,941 issued to Blessing, discloses a container for preserving liquids or other liquid food products wherein a cylindrical container is fitted with a follower lid which is supported by the upper level of the liquid and descends downward as the contents of the container are dispensed via a spigot located thereinbelow. This reference discloses a lid which adaptively employs a flexible seal, said seal being attached to the perimeter of the round lid so that an essentially air tight relationship relative to the liquid food product results. The lid is of a diameter which at least equals the inside diameter of the vessel inBlessings design. Moreover, the above cited design must be incorporated into a non pourable, static urn type dispensing appliance.Under these design constraints the contents can never be poured from the container, for the lid would tumble out of the container. A spigot located along the bottom well of the tank is the sole egress means for removing the heated beverage from the reservoir. In fact, the lid is weighted so that its center of gravity is as low as possible and is located at the center point of the lid it is designed so that its travel path is restricted to an upward and downward movement making it impossible to tilt the appliance and the lid to thereby effect pouring. Prior art embodiments reveal that, notwithstanding the basic methodology or construction of said referenced appliance, the basic mechanical principle involved is to dispose a sealing lid within the confines of an immovable, non tiltable, cylindrical tank. Therefore, the sealing lid moves in an upward and downward travel path and is perpendicular to, and is supported by, the level of the food or drink product. Hence, there has been a longstanding need for a follower lid that is adapted for use with hand pourable containers and that will track the level of the beverage during pouring while preventing exposure of the contained liquid to the elements.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention provides a follower lid for preventing oxidation of and loss of volatiles from such hot, liquid comestibles as coffee, tea, soup or the like and which lid can be used in combination with hand held vessels from which the liquids are dispersed by pouring. The follower lid is disposed within an essentially cylindrical vessel with the lid being of a diameter which is less than the inside diameter of the ves sel, and being designed to float above the hot liquid. The floatingly retained lid is not confined to a simple upward and downward travelpath, but is able to conform to the angle and to the level of the surface of the liquid, allowing for said beverage to be poured from the vessel, while at the same time retaining the lid within said vessel.Moreover, the follower lid preferably possess an internally formed insulation space, which aids in maintaining the liquid comestible in a heated condition. The hollowed insulation space created within the follower lid acts as a thermal barrier and may be filled with insulating materials, left as an air space or may be occupied by a vacuum or a gas. In addition, the vessel may be disposed under any of the several drip coffee maker units without mechanical alterations of the unit. Heat input requirements from a bottom heating plate or elswhere for maintaining the liquid at a constant elevated temperature is significantly reduced because of reduced heat loss from the liquid surface. Not only does the present invention possess the above enumerated advantage of providing an excellent thermal barrier, but also the floatable lid which essentially covers the liquid food or drink product disposed thereinbelow preserves and protects the commestible product from exogenous sources of contamination, and greatly reduces loss of desirable aromatic constituents contained within the liquid.The present vessel and follower lid combination maintains a liquid comestible e.g. coffee or tea in an uncontaminated state for use or sale and prevents the oxidation of said comestibles, which is normally promoted by a combination of high temperatures and constant exposure to air. The lid which floats on the surface of the liquid comestible and covers almost totally said liquid provides an environment that will be resistive to evaporation or contamination. The unique structural design of a floatingly retained follower lid allows for pourability and preservation of the liquid product. As will be recognized however, the follower lid of this invention can be utilized effectively in straightwalled urns from which liquid is dispensed from a spigot located at the bottom portion of the urn. A further and totally unexpected advantage which has been established for this invention is that coffee brew flavor is enhanced over time.Thus, not only is coffee which has been brewed and maintained for several hours under the protective, floating lid of this invention greatly preferred to similarly brewed coffee which has been maintained for a like period of time in an identical pot without af floating lid but the coffee which has been stored for several hours under the lid is preferred to freshly brewed coffee. It is hypothesized that this enhancement or improvement in coffee flavor is due to favorable interactions among the retained volatiles, which volatiles, if not for the presence of the floating lid, would either escape from or be constantly refluxing above the surface of the brewed coffee, and or to reactions by non oxidized components of the brew. It has been further found that, with respect to brewed coffee, when milk or cream is added to a coffee brew which has been maintained for several hours under the floating lid of this invention a desirable golden brown color results comparable to the color obtained when milk or cream is added to freshly brewed coffee. The addition of milk or cream to coffee brew which has been exposed to the atmosphere for several hours results in the brew developing an undesirable grey cast.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 illustrates a perspective view of a hand held container in combination with the followr lid of this invention, for preserving and serving hot beverages Figure 2 is a sectional view taken along lines 2 2 of Figure 1 showing the operative kinetics as the lid rests within the upper surfaces of the liquid comestible and Figure 3 is a sectional view of another embodiment of the floating follower lid in combination wih a filled container.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring more specifically to the drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout, Figure 1 shows a person pouring a liquid comestible from the container and lid combination which embraces the present invention, said container and lid combination shall be generally referred to by the numeral 10. Figure 1 provides a view of the beverage container in a filled condition, and shows the overall relation between beverage container and lid 10 and a receptacle 34 located thereinbelow and situated to receive said liquid contents. The most prominent feature of this preferred embodiment of the present invention as illustrated is the fact that the beverage may be one handedly poured without affecting the integrity of the floatingly retained follower lid 20. Figure 1 best illustrates the present invention s ability to pour hot liquids as for example, coffee, while keeping said beverage in a non oxidized state and free from contamination. The lid, as one can see, floats on the top of liquid comestible 36 and within normal pouring angle limits will be adhesively retained within the uppermost boundaries of said liquid so that said liquid comestible may be poured from vessel 12 via spout 16 into awaiting receptacle 34. Lidded container 10 is designed for easy fil ling, said container being acceptably adapted to be placed beneath any one of several electric drip type coffee makers. Lid 20 may be placed within empty vessel 12 before the electric drip maker is activated, thereby allowing said coffee to stream over the outwardly convex upper lid surface. This upper arcing surface 24 of lid 20 acts as a channel to guide the dripping coffee over said upper surface and under said lid. As vessel 12 becomes filled, the lid 20 will float on top of finished beverage product 36, the lid rising with the level of said beverage. An alternate method would be to allow the vessel 12 to fill and then grasping knob 22 manually place the lid 20 over and on top of the contents retained therein.As one can see, by Figure 1, the ability to pour the heated beverage from the lidded container 10 into a cup necessitates a bouyant lid that will adjust to the level and angle of the food product contained within. It is also within the scope of this invention to fashion a drip type coffee maker wherein the coffee basket is placed directly on top of the floating lid which lid would be placed at the bottom of the coffee pot before the start of the coffee making cycle. Accordingly to this embodiment the lid and basket would move up in the pot as the pot fills with coffee. When operating in this manner exposure of brewed coffee to the air is further reduced, since the distance the brewed coffee must traverse between the bottom of the basket and the protection afforded beneath the floating lid is at a minimum. Typically the basket will be in direct contact with the lid at only the central portion of the upper lid surface, in order that flow of liquid through the coffee basket is not hindered. Figure 2 clearly illustrates the relationship displayed by floatingly retained follower lid 20 as it tracks the angle of the liquid comestible held within the lidded container 10. As a preferred embodiment, the lid 20 is essentially hollow, advantageously employing a boyancy line and a point of gravity that will, at all times, exert sufficient force downward to retain the lid within the upper surface of the beverage. In this configuration the adhesive forces which are explained or more fully elucidated hereinbelow, which interact against lid 20 in essence hold lid 20 within the surface of the liquid or comestible 36. Figures 1 and 2 clearly elucidate a most unique feature of the present invention. When vessel 12 is utilized for pouring a liquid a unique phenomeon may be observed concomitant with said use. When a person grasps lidded container 10 by handle means 18 and pours liquid comestible 36 therefrom and into receptacle 34 said receptacle being like the illustrated coffee cup, follower lid 20, remains stationary within said vessel. Hence, when vessel 12 is placed in a vertical orientation relative to the resting surface, said surface being like a heating unit of an electric coffee maker, lid 20 will track said beverage to effectively seal said beverage from outside contaminants and protect said beverage thereby from heat loss. Floating lid 20 is held within the surface of the retained beverage for a variety of reasons, which are direclty related to the design of said lid.Preferably, the lid is designed so that its bottom surface is slightly convex in shape. A biconvex shaped lid will float at a higher level and thus facilitate grasping an upstanding knob or handle without the consumers fingers coming into contact with hot liquid. The floatingly retained lid is designed so that there is an equal material distribution of weight within said hollowed lid the result being that the center of gravity and bouyancy lie on the same vertical line. Therefore, the force exerted by the top is such that it can be directed radially outward and downward relative to said product. Hence, when a person grips handle 18 of lidded container 10 to pour contents from said vessel, floating follower lid 20 will be held within and on the surface of said pourable comestible 36. Moreover, the inherent design of said lid which allows for a shallow draught, permits floating follower lid 20 to reside within the upper boundary layer of a liquid comestible 36. Knob 22 provides a means for the extraction of lid 20 from vessel 12. Said knob assembly is preferably integral with upper convex surface 24 but as an alternate embodiment may be fastened thereto. Figure 3 shows most clearly the manner in which a preferred embodiment of the lid 20 is disposed within vessel 12. Lid 20, as one can see, is of essentially hollow construction and possesses a void within upper arcing surface wall 24 and lower outwardly arcing wall 26. The resulting bi convex shape has a hollow void which may be filled with a variety of insulation materials including air or other inert insulating gases or perhaps even a vacuum. Said void creates a superior heat holding insulating area that will provide a barrier for keeping stored heat within the vessel, thereby reducing energy needs for maintaining desired temperatures. Especially when the lid 20 is made of glass or glass like material, a hydrophobic food approved polymeric material is desirable as a coating over the lid. The coating should, at a minimum, extend around the peripheral surface of the lid and can extend to envelope the entire lid, such as shown at reference numeral 30 in Fig. 3. The polymer must be heat resistant and not degrade under repeated exposure to acidic comestibles or high temperatures. Moreover, the polymer should be of a type that does not readily bind aromas or absorb odors. For example, the following polymers may be operatively substituted polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephalate, polycarbonate and nylon to name a few of what is an endless list of materials.Hydrophobic polymers are especially suited for the above stated task since they do not degrade upon exposure to high temperature and or acid or alkaline environments. Alternatively, it would be possible to fabricate the entire lid from polymeric materials.The vessel may be fabricated from glass, ceramic or metal material, but in the hand held vessel form is preferably of glass. Floating follower lid 20 is of a diameter that is from 90 to less than 100 of the internal dia meter of the vessel depicted as the distance between the inner wall surfaces 32a and 32b shown in Fig. 3.Preferably, the lid is at least 95 , most preferably at least 99 of the internal diameter of the vessel.According to Fig. 3, a biconvex shaped follower lid is further composed of an upper arcuate surface 24, a lower arcuate surface 26 meeting one another along gently curved edge 28 and defining therein a void space. The radius of curvature of the upper surface of the lid is noticeably less than the radius of curvature of the lower surface of the lid. The outwardly arching bottom surface 26 of lid 20 facilitates not only adhesion of said lid within the boundary of said liquid, but also, encourages the removal of said lid by preventing the formation of suction from evolving as the lid is withdrawn from the liquid by upward extraction exerted against knob 22. As an alternate embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 2, the lid according may be designed with an essentially flat bottom surface.A flat bottom construction for the lid might enable a less complex manufacturing method to be utilized. Having thus described the invention, what is claimed is.
