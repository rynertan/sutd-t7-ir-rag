# Reusable locking tube in a reconstitutable fuel assembly.

## Abstract
The invention relates generally to a reconstitutable nuclear fuel assembly having its top nozzle removably affixed to guide thimble upper end portions 42 forming inner sockets 54 which extend into outer sockets 50 in the top nozzle adapter plate 40 and there are bulge fit to the latter. The bulge fit connection between the inner and outer sockets is maintained by means of locking tubes 48 which are removably inserted into the inner sockets and are held therein against undesirable axial displacement of the locking tubes from their locking positions. The locking tubes 48 according to the invention are reusable, each consisting of a tubular body 70 , and a pair of dimples 72 provided at diametrically opposed locations on the outer surface of the tubular body to form an interference fit between the inner socket and the locking tube when inserted therein, the dimples 72 being preformed on the locking tube prior to initial use thereof, and being configu rated such as to resist yielding and dimensional change during insertion and removal of the locking tube.
