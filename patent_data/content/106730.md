# Radiation sensitive emulsion and direct positive photographic element containing the same.

## Abstract
Photographic elements particularly adapted for forming direct positive images, comprised of a support and, coated on said support, a plurality of silver halide emulsion layers, the emulsion layers are characterized by a first, radiation sensitive emuision layer containing core shell silver halide grain population having a coefficient of variation of less than 20 , and a second silver halide emulsion layer substantially incapable of forming a surface latent image within the direct positive exposure latitude of the first emulsion layer and containing a second grain population capable of internally trapping photolytically generated electrons, said second grain population having an average diameter less than 70 that of said first grain population, and said first and second silver halide grain populations being present in a weight ratio of from 5 1 to 1 5.
