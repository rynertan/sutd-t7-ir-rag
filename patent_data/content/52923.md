# Alkali soluble blends of an ionomer resin and an alkenyl succinic anhydride.

## Abstract
Intimate fusion blends of 100 parts of an ionomer resin and about 5 to 900 parts of an alkenyl succinic anhydride the alkenyl group containing about 16 to 52 carbon atoms are provided. The compositions can be heated with aqueous alkaline solutions to form stable dispersions useful as coating compositions.
