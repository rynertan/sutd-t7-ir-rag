# FLUID SUPPLY SYSTEM, A CONNECTOR, A VALVE, AN ATOMIZER AND A METHOD OF SUPPLYING WATER

## Abstract
A fluid supply system 1 has a plastic bag reservoir 2 into which the other parts of the system may be packed. The other parts of the system include a flow pipe 5, a connector 6 to con nect the pipe 6 to a wall of the reservoir 2 and fluid supply drip valve outlets 8. The connector 6 may be arranged to puncture a hole in the reservoir wall and grip the wall as the parts of the connector are interengaged. Each drip valve 15 is adjustable to vary the amount of fluid supplied from the reservoir 2 to a growbag 7. The parts 16 and 17 of the drip valve 15 may be rotatated relative to one another to vary the drip feed rate of fluid. An atomizer 1 comprising a connecting portion 2 , end spray cap 3 and rotatable atomizing disc 4 may also be con nected in the system.
