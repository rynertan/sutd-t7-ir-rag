## Abstract
Process for the preparation of a solid carbon containing material having a sorption capacity for metal ions. The invention concerns a process of preparing solid metal sorbents from cheap carbonaceous material, like rubber waste, peat, coal or petroleum coke. The material is first mixed with sulphur and heated at 120 500 C and then subjected to a treatment with an aqueous alkali solution. Optionally and prior to the latter treatment a moderate oxidizing step is included. The resulting solid product is an excellent metal sorbent for effluent treatment and the like.
