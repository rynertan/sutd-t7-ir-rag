## Description
COLUMN INJECTION APPARATUS Background of the Invention The present invention generally relates to a sample injection apparatus for use with a liquid chromatography column and, in particular, relates to an apparatus wherein the sample conduit extends into the packing of the column to which the apparatus is affixed. One of the most critical operations in the liquid chromatographic analysis of a sample is the introduction of the sample containing fluid onto the chromatographic separation column. The critical nature of sample introduction can best be understood by recognizing that, once introduced into a column, the bandwidth of the sample only increases. Thus, to luaintain reasonable separations, it is critical for a sample to be introduced with the narrowest possible bandwidth Historically, the best method of sample injection has been by means of a hypodermic syringe that penetrated a few millimeters into the center of tube column packing. An excellent review of the effect of different prior art methods of sample injection is presented in an article by J.J.Kirkland in GasChromatography, 1972 Applied Science Publishers for the Institute of Petroleum,London, England 1972 p. 39 et seq. and in an article by Kirkland, et al.,Journal of Chromatographic Science, Vol. 15, 1979 p. 303 et seq. The use of a hypodermic syringe can, of course, be accomplished only in conjunction with a sputum injection system. The effective use of a hypodermic syringe with continuous solvent flow is, however, limited to column pressures of less than about 2000 p.s.i. Beyond such column pressures it is nearly impossible to eject the sample from the syringe. Thus, as most modern liquid chromatography systens operate at column pressures in excess of 3000 p.s.i., the use of hypodermic syringes is quite diminished and relatively sporadic. At relatively high column prsr Jrcs, i.c., where the use of a h3lrodermic syringe is ineffective, it is conventional to utilize a sampling valve arrangement wherein sample is delivered to the column by means of a pumping mechanism. At present, in such systems, the sample is almost always directed through a conduit which terminates at the center of the top frit of the column above the packed bed thereof. In this fashion, the sample is discharged directly onto the center of the frit and preferably carried onto the column by a curtain flow of solvent surrounding the center conduit. As an alternative, it is known that the conduit can extend through a hole in the frit to discharge the sample directly onto the top of the packing. More recently, the art of column injection has developed to effectively eliminate the use of a separate center flow plus a separate curtain flow. Much present day effort is directed toward developing and refining various mechanlsms for radially distributing a solvent sample mixture. In such mechanisms, the mixture is 4 introduced onto the column above the packing and is passed through a plate or a set of screens to distribute the mixture across the cross section of the column prior to the mixture reaching the parking material. It has been determined that such sample introduction mechanisms may actually accelerate the deterioration of a separating column. The combined use of relatively small packing material, i.e., material of 3 to 5 micrometer diameter, and increasingly higher column pressures, i.e., about 5000 p.s.i, invariably causes the packing material of even an ideally packed column to resettle within the column. Such resettling results in the formation of a crown at the top of the column which is either totally void of packing material or has a total void and a layer of irregularly or loosely packed material. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide a column injection apparatus which not only deters the formation of a crown but maintains and or regains column efficiency should a crown form or exist. This object is accomplished, at least in part, by an apparatus including an injection conduit, through which a sample containing fluid may be pumped, affixed to a column termination cap which conduit extends beyond the cap a distance greater than any existing or anticipated crown thickness. Other objects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed specification in conjunction with the appended drawing. rief Description of the Drawing The drawing, not drawn to scale, includes Figures lA and 1B, which are diagrams of apparatus embodying the principles of the present invention Figures 2A and 2B, which are diagrams of alternative embodiments of sample solvent delivery mechanisms Figures 3A and 3B, which are chronatograns of comparative analyses employing newly packed chromatographic columns Figures 4A and 4B, which are chromatograms of comparative analyses employing a previously deteriorated chromatographic columns Figures 5A through 5D, which are comparative chromatograms for various center flow curtain flow ratios utilizing an extremely deteriorated chromatographic column and Figures 6A through 6C, which are comparative chromatograms for various center flowlcurtain flow ratios utilizing a new column. Detailed Description of the Invention An apparatus, generally indicated at 10 in Figure 1A, embodying the principles of the present invention, includes a sample delivery tube 12 affixed to, and extending tltrn.ti h, a cap 14, which cap 14 is designed to be connected to one end 16 of a chromatographic column 18, by means of a receiving tube 20. For reasons more fully discussed below, the sample delivery tube 12 preferably extends a preselected distance beyond the cap 14.In one embodiment, the cap 14 includes a curtain flo conduit 22 through which a curtain flow of solvent material can be tntruduccd onto the packing 24 of the column 18. The cn.bodiment shown in Figure 1A additionally includes a means 26 for distributing the curtain flow of solvent across the cross section of the column 18, The means 26 can be any such mechanism knon in the art such as a scintered frit disc or a plurality of screens or a radial distribution plate.Although a sclntered disc is preferred, any means 26 can be employed so lang as the curtain flow of solvent is distributed, i.e., the curtain flow about the sample delivery tube l2 is created, prior to reaching the packing 24 of the column 18. Thus, while the curtain flow conduit 22 is shown in Figure IA as entering the cap 14 just above the distributing means 26, it could also be connected, for example, by means of a T junction 28 shown in Fig. 1B along the receiving tube 20 protruding from the cap 14. As well known in the art, it is highly desirable to minimize dispersion of the sample fluid prior to the introduction thereof onto the column 18. To this end, the sample delivery tube 12r in the embodiment shown in Figure 1A is comprised of an inner tube 30 having an outside diameter ot about 0.75 millimeters and an inside diameter of about 0.25 millimeters. For support and rigidity, the tube 30 is affixed within an outer tube 32 having an inside diameter of about 0.75 millimeters and an outside diameter of about 1.5 millimeters. The tubes, 30 and 32, can be affixed together by any means known in the art, for example, bg soldering techniques.Additionally, the outside diameter of the outer tube 32 is chosen so as to mate with conventional plumbinglike unions and or TTl junctions. An alternative sanple delivery tube 12 design which also achieves minimum dispersion of the sample containing fluid is shown in Figure lB. Therein, the sample delivery tube 12 has an inside diameter on the order of about 0.5 millimeters and is packed with a plurality of glass beads 34 having an average diameter of about 35 micrometers. Preferably, the glass beads 34 are scintered at about 7 09c to stabilize the subsequent packing thereof in the sample delivery tube 12. Either of these sample delivery tubes 14 can be used in the apparatus 10, In either embodiment, the sample delviery tube 12 must have a length such that, when the cap 14 is affixed to the column 18, it extends beyond the distribution means 26 a preselected distance tdt so that is passes through a crown 36 at the top of the column 18. As mnre fully discussed blow, the crown 36 conprises a void 37 and or a layer 38 of irregularly or loosely packed matcrial. The depth of the crown 36 is usually less than about 8 millimcters. Thus, in the practical embodiment of the apparatus 10, the sample delivery tube 12 extends beyond the cap 14 a distance equal to the thickness of the distributing means 26 plus about 8 millimeters. For assembly purposesa the sample delivery tube 12 is not packed uith the scintered glass beads 3A, a length of wire, for example stainless steel, is passed through the tube 12 so that it terminates at the end to be placed in the packing 24. When the tube 12 is secured, the wire is removed and hence no column packing 24 will have entered the tube 12. The fluid flow to the sample delivery tube 12 and the curtain flow conduit 22 is preferably provided and controlled by either of two different systems, 40 and 42, shown in Figure 2 A and 2B respectively. Referring specifically to Figure 2A, the system 40 shown therein includes a solvent source 44, a sample source 46, a mixing valve 48, a center flow conduit 50 and a curtain flow conduit 52 As shown, the center flow conduit 50 includes a first hydraulic resistor 54 in line therewith and the curtain flow conduit 52 includes a second hydraulic resistor 56 in line therewith. As shown, solvent from the solvent source 44 is directed according to the relative values of the resistors, 54 and 56, into the center flow conduit 50 and the curtain flow conduit 52. By means of the mixing valve 48, the solvent from the center flow conduit 50 is mixed with the sample fluid prior to introduction thereof into the sample delivery tube 12. The major advantage of the system 40 is that it is readily adaptable for use in solvent gradient analysis.Preferably, in this embodiment, the hydraulic, or flow, resistors, 54 and 56, can be conduit sections having inside diameters which are selected to introduce the appropriate flow resistance, although other types of hydraulic resistor elements could also be used. Referring to Figure 2B, the system 42 includes two pumps, a solvent fluid pump 5S and a sample fluid pump 60, the sample fluid pump 60 is in line with a sample valve 62. The solvent pump 58 connects a solvent source 64 to the center flow conduit 22 by means of a solvent conduit 66. The sample pump 60 connects a sample source 68 with the sample delivery tube 12 via a sample conduit 70. The major advantage of the system 42 is that ratio of curtain flow to center flow is easily and simply adjusted. Such an arrangement can be desirable in the recovery of deteriorated columns wherein the most effective flow ratio can be experimentally ascertained. The performance characteristics of the above described embodiments is discussed herelnafter by reference to four specific examples. The examples which follow all utilize a test sample having a five component mixture of benzene, toluene, etltylbenzene, isopropylbenzene and tertiary butyibenzene as a 0.25Z v v solution in the mobile phase solution. The snmple volume was 1 microliter.Example 1. Although the present apparatus was particularly developed to improve, or extend, the life of deteriorated columns, it has been found, see, for example, Figures 3A and 3B, to be at least as good as conventional injection mechanism when used with well packed new columns. Referring to Figures 3A and 3B. In this particular example, a new well packed column was examined utilizing a configuration employing the relatively narrow tube structure shown in Figure 1A and the dual pump configuration shown in Figure 2B. The resulting chromatograms are shown inFigures 3A and 3B. 3A demonstrates the peaks obtained during use of a normal injection device, i.e., where the sample fluid was introduced at or just beyond the frit of the new column. In the experimental technique employing the present invention, a center flow to curtain flow ratio of 0.5 0.5 was utilized. As will be easily observable from Figure 3, the efficiencies yielded by the column measured with a normal injection system are about equal, i.e, about 8900 theoretical plates compared to about 8700 theoretical plates when the present injection apparatus was utilized.This difference is well within the error of measurement and close to the theoretical design.From this example, it will be recognized that the present injection apparatus can be interchanged or used in place of modern present day injection apparatus without loss of separation accuracy or column efficiency. Example 2. Next, a deteriorated colon was measured utilizing a normal or conventional injection apparatus and yielded a theoretical plate number of about 1600 and, as shown in Figure 4A, the end peaks are tailing. As shown in Figure 4B, however, the efficiency, i.e., the theoretical plates, of the column, is greatly increased, to about 3900 theoretical plates, by use of the present column injection apparatus using a center flow to curtain flow ratio of approximately 0.5 0.5 and the peaks are more symmetrical. It should also be pointed out that in the recovery of this deteriorated column the configuration shown in Figure 2A was employed where the hydraulic resistors, 54 and 56, or restrictors, of the conduits were made approximately equal.Example 3. A column having a relatively large void or crown, i.e., about 6 mm, was next subjected to examination employing both a conventional injection system and an embodiment of the present invention and wherein the flow ratio was varied to obtain the maximum efficiency. The first chromatogram on the extreme left represents a chromatogram received from using a conventional injection system and was determined to have an efficiency of about 2000 theoretical plates. The present apparatus including the double pump delivery system, shown in Fig. 2B, was utilized. As indicated, when the center flow curtain flow ratio was 0.5 0.5, the efficiency of the column was extremely poor to the extent of yielding double peaks. Some improvement was gained when the flow ratio was 0.2 0.8.However, a reasonable, if not exceptional, performance was obtained when the flow ratio of 0.1 0.9 depicted on the extreme right was utilized. The efficiency for the column on the extreme right was determined to be about 2000 theoretical plates. Although the efficiencies for the chromatograms shown in Figures SA and 5D are about equal, i.e., about 2000 theoretical plates, the symmetry of the peaks have been vastly improved by use of an apparatus embodying the principles of the present invention. Such column efficiencies can occur even with poor peak symmetry since the efficiency is determined using measurements token at ahnttt tho n.C7 bright potnr. of the peak. Thus, it vill he observed that not only is the efficiency maintained or improved, but the qunlitv of the peaks, i.e., the symmetry, is improved. In a practical method for utilizing, or rejuvenating, a deteriorated column, the most advantageous center flow curtain flow ratios can be initially ascertained utilizing the double pump arrangement shown inFigure 2B. Subsequently, an arrangement such as shown in Figure 2A can then be provided wherein the flow restrictors 54 and 56 provide the previously determined ratios. Example 4. In this example, the columns tested were new and not previously tested. The top three chromatograms were derived from the use of conventional injection means whereas the lower chromatograms were obtained utilizing an injection apparatus embodying the principles of the present invention. while there was significant improvement in chromatograms for the 20 micrometer and 5 micrometer columns, the comparative chromatograms for the 3 micrometer column Figure 6C demonstrates an exceptionally practical improvement. That is, based on the upper chromatogram, this column would have been rejected as it exhibited double peaks, but, when used with the present injection apparatus, it exhibited excellently defined and symmetrical peaks. Thus, by use of the present injection apparatus, what would have been a useless column can now be used with accurate results. Hence, the inescapable conclusion is that the column injection apparatus described herein yields results which are at least as good as that presently achievable by conventional injection mechanisms or configurations.In addition, it is conceivable and practical through the use of the present column injection apparatus to recover and extend the life of even extremely deteriorated columns. Such recovery or life extension has been unheard of heretofore in the art. Although certain specific embodiments and examples have been described herein, other configurations and modifiratfens can be made to the present apparatus witllant departing from tlle scope ami srtrit of tlie invention herein. Thus, the description herein ifi considered to be exemplary and not limiting in any fashion and the present invention is deemed to be limited only by the claims appended hereto and the reasonable interpretation thereof.
