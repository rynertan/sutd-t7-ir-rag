## Description
Colour change device for use with a light spot projector and the likeThe invention relates to a colour change device for use with a light spot projector and the like, provided with a colour filter housing with means of forming a light outlet opening for the light from a light source, and with selectively movable means of filtering fitted with various colour filters transverse to the emergent light path. This colour change device is known from Dutch PatentApplication 7603525.Such a colour change device for use with a light spot projector can very advantageously be used in ship bridge simulators to simulate shipping traffic in night situations for training purposes. Here it must be possible for the colour filters required for the light spot to be projected and for any other purposes, such as red, orange, yellow, green, white and black, to be inserted in the light path.In the above mentioned known colour change device, one or more plates are swivel mounted on a rotary shaft coupled to a rotary motor such as a stepping motor. In each of these plates, there can be one or more round colour filters which are arranged next to one another in an arc and which can be swivelled in front of the light outlet opening when the stepping motor is energised. The design is relatively bulky. PurS nmxe, the prcblem ariees that on changing from one colour to another, the appropriate filters far which are not adjacent to each other, several successive steps via other colour filters are needed to position the desired colour filter in front of the light outlet opening.As a result, this colour change is relatively slow.The object of the invention is to eliminate the above mentioned problems end pride a simple and reliable colour change device with which, in view of the requirements set in the field of application1 colour changes can be achieved quickly in less than 0.1 sec, using only a small amount of power.This is achieved according to the invention in the case of a colour change device of the type mentioned in the preamble in that the means of filtering comprise afilberdisc with a generally annular rim of ferrous metal, the centre of the said disc in the rest position roughly coinciding with the light path, and in which the colour filters are mounted as sectors so as to form a circle, and that around the filter disc a number of radially arranged electromagnets are provided to attract the filter disc and place one of the colour filters in the light path on excitation of at least one of the electromagnets.In this design according to the invention, in which the filter disc can be placed immediately in front of the light outlet opening, a slight movement of the filter disc will be sufficient to change the colour or extinguish or light up the light beam. Owing to the small diameter of the light beam and the above mentioned slight mnaner, the filter disc can be small and light in weight, for which small electromagnets requiring only low electric power are sufficient. As a result, very rapid changes can be achieved in less than 0.5 sec by the colour filters, for example if the light spot to be projected has to be used as a flashing light, lighthouse light or sector light.Because of the simplicity of the design described only one moving part the reliability is high, and the device is largely maintenance free. In this design according to the invention, the easy sccessibility of the filter disc also means that the colour change device is easy to inspect and maintain. With this design according to the invention, driving or exciting the filter disc can be carried out easily from an output port of a microprocessor. The invention will be explained in greater detail on the basis of an embodiment with reference to.the drawings, in which the same parts in the various figures are indicated by the same reference numbers, and in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment according to the invention Fig. 2 is a cross section view of the embodiment of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a schematic front view of the embodiment of Fig. 1 with the filter disc in the rest position andFig. 4 is an enlarged schematic front view of the embodiment ofFig. 1 with the filter disc in one of the excited positions.The embodiment of the invention shown in Fig. 1 comprises a colour filter housing 1 provided in the centre with a through channel 2 in which an optical fibre 3, such as a glass fibre, is accommodated in a holder,the said usucal fibre acting as a light source at the plane 4 in the light outlet qwrLngat tat point. The light fibre holder 14 can be secredby means of a grab screw not illustrated . Provided just in front of and outside the outlet plane 4 is a freely movable filter disc 5, consisting of a generally annular rim of ferrous metal. This rim is elastically suspended on a compensating spring 6 which runs through a channel 13 in the filter housing and is secured to the filter housing at the other end by means of a lockin screw 7.In the filter disc 5 are a number in this embodiment six of sector shaped colour filters 8. In the rest position of the disc its centre is approximately directly opposite the light outlet opening V in the path of the emergent light beam. The elastic suspension of the filter disc on the wire type compensating spring 6 is such that both compensation for the weight of the filter disc itself, so that less electric power is needed to drive it, and a guarantee of a fixed starting position for the disc when there is no excitation are achieved.Provided in the filter housing 1 around the filter disc are a number in this embodiment six of electromagnets corresponding to the number of colour filters and running radially relative to the said disc. The cores of these electromagnets are attached at one end by means of screw thread and locking nut to a mounting ring 12, while the other end of the cores project into openings of a raised ring 10 round the filter disc. In order to prevent the filter disc from being able to slip off the compensating spring, the front face of the filter housing is provided with a cover plate 11, disposed free of the disc and made of transparent material such as perspex, which may be provided in the centre with an opening for the light beam to pass through.In order to obtain a more selective movement of one of the colour filters, the rim of the filter disc can be provided with projections or teeth situated in each case opposite the electro rqyf s. The design can be such that each tooth is radially in line with an adjoining sector shaped colour filter, the filter being suspended on the compensating spring in such a way that each tooth lies opposite an electromagnet. On selective excitation of one electromagnet, the corresponding tooth is attracted and the colour filter at the other side of the filter dise is thereby placed in front of the light outlet opening. The design can also be as shown in Fig. 3 rest position andFig. 4 excited position , where each tooth of the teeth T1 to T6 of the filter dise is radially in line with the dividing line between two colour filters 8. On selective excitation of two adjoining electromagnets of the set of electromagnets S1 to S6, the two corresponding adjoining teeth are attracted, causing the colour filter situated at the other side between the continuous dividing lines to be positioned in front of the light outlet opening V Fig. 4 . With this selective excitation of two adjoining electromagnets, a very stable positioning of the filter disc is obtained as a result of the disc always being fixed at two tooth positions.As a result of mechanical friction, it can happen that the teeth, e.g. T4 and T5, do not end up precisely opposite the electromagnetsS4 and S5, but this does not have any effect whatsoever on correct positioning of the colour filter opposite in relation to the light outlet opening of the light fibre so long as the teethT4 and T5 are in contact with the cylindrical frame of the raised ring 10.For proper functioning of the colour change device it is important that the rim of the filter disc and the cores should be made of ferrous metal, such as iron, and that the remaining parts of the device are made of plastic or non ferrous metal. The filter housing, preferably made of non light transmitting material, may be of black plastic, while the mounting ring and the magnetic core may be of iron. The compensating spring is made of steel wire, while the holder of the glass fibre is of brass.For excitation of the coils of the electromagnets, a voltage of 6 volts is adequate, with the resistance in one coil being 9 ohms.The current consumption at 6 volts is 110 mA, while the input power is 0.66 watts. With this supply voltage of 6 volts, quick driving of the filter disc takes place, while the heat generated in the coils of the electromagnets is fully acceptable.
