## Description
INSTANT ADHESIVE COMPOSITION UTILIZING CALIXARENE ACCELERATORSBackground of The Invention In DE CS No. 2,816,836, dated October 26, 1978 there are described cyanoacrylate adhesive compositions which employ crown ethers as polymerization accelerators. Such corpc sitions are useful for bonding acidic surfaces such as wood which inhibit cyanoacrylate polymerization. Crown ethers, however, are known to be very toxic, th. reported effects of exposure including damage to the central nervous system and testicular atrophy. LecDgt B.K.J., Chem.Eng. News, 53, 5 1975 . Furthermore, such accelerators are reportedly very difficult to synthesize, supplying the desired product in only low yields because o√ß the tendency to produce intermolecular linkages. Accoraircly, there is a peed for alternative cyanoacrylate accelerators suitable for wood bonding applicators. in II.S. Patent 4,170,585, there are described cyanoacrylate compositions in which certain polyethylene glycols or poly ethylenecxy functional surfactants act as wood boding accelerators. Such compounds, however, have the reported disadvantage that they tend to contain water and other difficult to remove substances which spontaneously initiate pclymerization of the cyanoacrylate monomer. U.S. Patent 4,377,490 discloses mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic polyols and polyethers said to improve initial strength of cyanoacrylate wood bonding products. L.S. Patent 4,386,193 discloses certain 3 or A arm polyol podand compounds as alternatives to crown ether accelerators. Japan Kokai Tokkyo Foho 82 70171, suggests the use of certain polyorganosiloxane compounds which nclude po3yether substituents as additives for wood bonding cyanoacrylate compositions. Cheer. Abstracts, 97 145913n reports the use of a hydroxy terminated poly dimethylsiloxane in fast bonding cyanoacrylate compositions. DE OS 3,006,071 discloses certain furan derivatives as co accelerators with crown ethers in cyanoacrylate composi tion. Summary of The Invention The present invention is a new cyanoacrylate composition for bonding wood and other de activating surfaces such as leather, ceramic, plastics and metals with chromate treated or acidic oxide surfaces. The inventive compositions are standard cyanoacrylate adhesive formulations to which have been sd, as accelerators, certain calixarene compounds stable to cyanoacrylate monomers. The calixarene compounds are preferably employed at levels between about 0.18 and 1 by weight of the composition. The calixarene compounds particularly usefui in the invention may be represented by the formula EMI2.1 where R1 is alkyl, alkoxy, substituted alkyl or slbstituted alkoxy R2 is H or alkyl and n 4, 6, or 8. Detailed Description of The Invention The Oc cyanoacrylate type adhesive composition of this invention as described above contains an X alpha cyanoacrylate monomer of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R represents a straight cain or branched chain alkyl group having 3 to 12 carbon atoms which may be sub stituted with a substituted such as a halogen atom or ar alkoxy group a straight chain or branched chain alkenyl group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, a straight chain or branched chain alkynyl group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group, an aralkyl group or an aryl group.Specific examples of the groups for R are a methyl group, ar. ethyl group, an n propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n butyl group, an isobutyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, ar. allyl group, a methallyl group, a crotyl group, a propargyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a benzyl group, a phenyl group, a cresyl group, a 2 chlcroethyl group, a 3chloropropyl group, a 2 chlorobutyl group, a trifluoroethyl group, a 2 methoxyethyl group, a 3 methoxybut l group and a 2 ethoxyethyl group Ethyl cyanoacrylate is the preferred monomer for use in the inventive compositions. A single cyanoacrylate monomer or a mixture of two or more cf these os cyanoacrylate monomers can be used. Generally, the above oc cyanoacrylate monomer alone is not sufficient as an adhesive, and the components set forth below are sometimes added. 1 An anionic pclymerizatin ini bitor 2 A radical polymerization inhibitor 3 A thickener 4 Special additives such as plasticizers and heat stabilizers 5 Perfumes, dyes, pigments, etc. A suitable amount of the cyanoacrylate monomer present in the adhesive composition is about 80 to 99.9E by weight, preferably 90 to 99.9 by weight, based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. An anionic polymerization inhibitor is added to the cyanoacrylate type adhesive composition, e.S.t in an amount of about 1 te 1000 ppm based Ull the total weight of the adhesive composition, to increase the stability of the adhesive composition during storage, and examples of known inhibitors are sulfur dioxide, aromatic sulfonic acids, aliphatic sulfonic acids, sultones, and carbon dioxide. Suitable examples of radical polymerization inhibitors include, for example, hydroquinone and hydroquinone monomethyl ether. A radical polymerization inhibitor is added, e.g., in amount of about 1 to 5000ppm based on the total weight of the adhesive composition, for the purpose of capturing radicals which are formed by light during storage. A thickener is added to increase the viscosity of the 6 cyanoacrylate type adhesive composition. The g cyanoacrylats monomer generally has a low viscosity of about several centi poises, and therefore, the adhesive penetrates into porous materials such as wood and leather or adherends having a rough surface. Thus, good adhesion strengths are difficult to obtain. Various polymers can be used as thickeners, and examples include poly methyl methacrylate , methacrylate type copclymers, acrylic rubbers, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl acetate and poly s cyanoacrylate . A suitable amount of thickener is generally about 205 by weight or less based on the total weight of the adhesive composition. As disclosed in the copending application of Alan Litke,Serial No. 528,275, filed August 31, 1983, certain fumed silica fillers treated with polydialkylsiloxanes or trialkyl planes may also be usefully employed as cyanoacrylate thickener The plasticizers, perfumes, dyes, pigments, etc., may be added depending on use purposes in amounts which do nct adversely affect the stability of the cyanoacrylate monomer. The use cf such additives is within the skill of those practicing in the cyanoacrylate adhesive art and need not be detailed herein. Cixarene compounds are known and may be readily syn thesized by methods described in C. Gutsche, Acc. Chem. Res., 16, 161 17C 1 8R , and references cited therein, the appropriate disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Synthesis methods for the calixarene compounds which are preferred for use in the invention are exemplified in examples 1 and 2 herein. The preferred compounds may be represented by formula I wherein R1 is OC2H5, R2 is H or t butyl and n 4 or 6. Cther suitable compounds include those of formula I where R is methoxy or methyl. The invention may be further understood with reference to the following non limiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of 3,38,39,4O,41,42 hexa 2 oxo 2 ethoxy ethoxy ca ix l6 arene In a l liter flask equipped with a Dean Stark trap, 30 grams of para tert butyl phenol, 12 grams of paraformaldehyde, 18 mls of a SN aqueous solution of rubidium hydroxide and 300 mls of xylene were refluxed for 5 hours. The cooled precipitate was filtered and suspended in 900 mls of chloroform and washed with 300 mls of 1 N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was separated, washed with water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to 300 mls. Methanol was added to yield a precipitate which represented a 52 yield of hexamer. A mixture of 6.48 grams of hexamer and excess sublimed aluminum chloride was stirred overnight in dry toluene under a nitrogen atmosphere. Water was added to destroy the excess aluminum chloride and toluene was removed on a rotary evaporator. The crude orange oil was dissolved in 300 ml dichloromethane and washed with dilute acid followed by water to remove inorganic salts. The dichloromethane was removed under reduced pressure and diethyl ether added to the residue. A precipitate was collected filtered and washed with ether. The remaining powder represented an 88 yield. This powder 3.75 grams was added to 8 mls of ethyl bromoacetate and excess potassium carbonate and refluxed in dry acetone for 48 hours. Removal of solvent and washing with water produced a 78 yield of crude product. Recrystallization from a benzene petroleum ether mixture yielded white ystals.
