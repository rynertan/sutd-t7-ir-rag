# Method of making amorphous semiconductor alloys.

## Abstract
A process for depositing semiconductor alloy films on a substrate by supplying microwave energy to a first gaseous mixture held at subatmospheric pressure in a reaction vessel to establish a glow discharge in the mixture, characterized in supplying microwave energy to a second gaseous mixture re mote from the substrate to form free radicals, conveying the free radicals to the vicinity of the substrate and incorporating the free radicals in the film.
