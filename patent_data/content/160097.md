# AREA MACHINING METHOD.

## Abstract
An area machining method for machining an area defined by an outline curve. To machine the inside of an area defined by an outline curve OLC consisting of a multiplicity of straight lines S1, S2, ...S6 and a circular arc A1 , the method includes a step of approximating a circular arc portion A1 of an offset curve OFC which is a predeter mined amount offset from the outline curve by straight lines a step of dividing the area defined by the offset curve which is approximated by the straight lines into a plurality of convex polygons PG1 to PG3 a step of calculating the centroid Wi of each of the convex to polygons and respective middle points M1, M2 of boundary lines B1, B2 between two convex polygons adjacent to each other, and generating a base line BL formed by successively connect ing together the centroids and the middle points a step of dividing into a predetermined number of sections each of the straight lines L1 to L4 which respectively connect the centroids Wi of the convex polygons and the apexes P1 to P10 of the convex polygons and each of the straight lines BL1 to BL4 which respectively connect the middle points M1, M2 and corresponding endpoints P1, P4 P4, P7 of the boundary lines halved by the respective middle points a step of moving a tool along a plurality of closed paths CPT1, CPT2 ... obtained by connecting together partition points P
