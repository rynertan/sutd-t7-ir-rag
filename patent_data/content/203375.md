# Apparatus for storing and applying surgical staples.

## Abstract
An apparatus for storing and automatically dispensing and applying surgical staples 100 in serial fashion includes a pistol like tool having means 101 for storing a large plurality of staples 100 in parallel, stacked column fashion aligned along the longitudinal barrel axis of the tool. A form tool 120 and an anvil tool 126 extend longitudinally parallel to the axis, and are advanced in synchronism by actuation of a trigger lever. The form tool 120 includes a pair of arms which impinge upon and rotate the legs of the staple 100 about the web portion thereof to dispose the staple 100 in a points first dispensing orientation along the longitudinal axis. The form tool advances the staple to the distal dispensing end of the tool, where it drives the staple into a portion 141 of the anvil 126 and crimps the staple thereabout. Release of the trigger causes an elevator member to separate the next distal staple in the column from its column alignment into position to be engaged by the anvil tool and form tool at the start of the subsequent dispensing cycle.
