# Organic electroluminescent devices having improved power conversion efficiencies.

## Abstract
Electroluminescent devices are disclosed comprising a hole injecting zone and an adjacent organic luminescent zone, having a combined thickness no greater than about 1 micron, which have a power conversion efficiency of at least 9 10 ⁵ w w. Preferred electron transporting compounds for the luminescent zone provide a maximum electroluminescent quantum efficiency of at least 5 10 ⁴ photons electron when tested as described.
