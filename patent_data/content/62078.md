# WIRE ELECTRODE DISCONNECTION PROCESSING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A wire electrode disconnection processing apparatus for wire cut discharge machining equipment for machining a work piece to a desired shape while moving the work relative to a wire electrode in accordance with machining instruction date. This apparatus has memories CPX, CPY for storing the position where the wire electrode is disconnected, means MDI, OP for generating an instruction for releasing the work from the disconnected position Xc, Yc to a predetermined position after the disconnection, means CPU, OP for generating the instruction for returning the work to the disconnected position Xc, Yc after the wire electrode is again extended to a wire running system, and means PD, SX, SY, MX, MY for positioning the work at the predetermined position and the disconnected position Xc, Yc in accordance with the respective instructions.
