# Chemically bondable foundry sand.

## Abstract
A chemically bondable foundry sand comprising a mixture of sand, binder and a plurality of fibres intimately mixed and dispersed throughout the mixture. Cores and moulds made from such sand have improved fracture resistance. The mixture may comprise from 0.01 to 1.0 wt. of fibres, the length diameter ratio of each fibre may be at least 10 and the fibres may have a length of from 1 to 20 mm. The fibres may be glass fibres, organic fibres or natural fibres. The binder may comprise a silicate binder or an organic binder such as a phenolic binder or a furane binder.
