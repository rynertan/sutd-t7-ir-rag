# Polyimide composite.

## Abstract
A composite for use in vibration damping and thermal insulation in aerospace applications formed from a core 10 of a foamed polyimide, with a backing layer 12 bonded to one face of the core. This backing layer to include a thin metal foil bonded to the core with a visco elastic adhesive 14 . Composite provides superior damping and lower weight and significantly improved fire safety compared with existing products.
