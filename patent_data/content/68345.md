## Description
SYMMETRICAL COUPLED LINE COPLANAR WAVEGUIDE FILTER BACKGROUND O THE INVENTION This invention is directed to microwave filters, and more particularly to such filters having a co planar waveguide CPW construction. Edge coupled bandpass filters of the stripline or microstrip variety are. well known. These may typically comprise a configuration as shown in figures 1 and 2 in which first and second stripline conductors 10 and 12 are deposited on the upper surface of a dielectric substrate 14 having a ground plane 16 on the lower surface thereof. In such a filter cnnfigu ration, a signal on one of the conductors, for example conductor 10, will be coupled across a gap 18 to the other conductor 12, and these filters perform substantially as desired even when the transmission lines are asymmetrical. The design techniques for microstrip filters are well known and are described, for example, in Design of Microwave Filters, ImDedance Matchinq Networks, and Coupling Structures, by Matthaei et al,Section 8.09.The synthesis procedure generally begins from a low pass prototype, and yields required values for even and odd mode impedances Zoe and ZOO, respectively, for each coupled section. For purposes of discussion, the odd mode imped ance ZOO can be considered the impedance of either conductor when both conductors have opposite potentials i.e., 1 and 1 volt , while the even mode impedance Zoe can be considered the impedance of either conductor when both have the same potential.In obtaining a desired filter response, it is important that each of the conductors 10 and 12 have sub stantially the same even mode impendance Zoet and oad mode impendance ZOO this is generally not difficult in a inicrostrip configuration since each of the conductors 10 and 12 is separated from the same ground plane by the same thickness of dielectric 14. In a CPW configuration, the input and output conductors and the ground plane are all coplanar. As shown in figures 3 and 4, conductors 20 and 22 are disposed on the upper surface of the dielectric 24 in a configuration similar to that of Figure 1, and the ground plane 16 in Figure 2 is replaced by a pair of grounded conductors 26 on the upper surface of the dielectric and on either side of the conductors 20 and 22. CPW edge coupled filters as shown in Figure 3 using two edge coupled lines exhibiting the desiredZoe and Z00 values perform poorly due to their as yin metrical construction.Note that in the centercoupl ing section of the filter of Figure 3, the conductor 20 will be closer than the conductor 22 to the upper ground conductor 26, and conversely the conductor 22 will be closer than the conductor 20 to the lower ground conductor 26. This asymetrical coupling of the conductors 20 and 22 to the different ground conductors can cause field asymmetry about the center line of transmission 28, and this may result in the excitation of an odd mode of propagation between the ground planes. This odd mode of propagation tends to cause unwanted transmission responses which are difficult to predict, and some type of suppression, e.g.the use of bond wires placed over the line from one ground plane to the other, is usually required to obtain even partially satisfactory performance. As a consequence of the above difficulties, the use of CPW filters has been limited to applications where high quality filters are not required, and improvements in CPW filter technology are needed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a coplanar waveguide CPW filter which is substantially free of the above difficulties and performs satisfactorily even where high quality filters are required. Briefly, the CPW filter according to the present invention comprises first and second conductors and first and second ground planes all disposed on the same surface of a dielectric substrate, the first conductor haying an enlarged coupling portion and the second conductor having a bifurcated coupling portion interposed between said first conductor and each of said ground planes. The first and second conductors are symmetrical with respect to the transmission center line at all points.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ThE PREFERRED EfIBODIFfEE The filter according to the present invention is based on the recognition that the odd mode propagation resulting in spurious filter response characteristics in known CPW filters could be substantially eliminated by utilizing a filter structure which is symmetrical about the center line of transmission. Figure 5 illustrates a threefinger CPW filter construction utilizing symmetrical interleaved transmission lines.In this filter structure, a first conductor 30 and second conductor 32 are disposed on a dielectric substrate 34 between ground planes 36. The conductors 30 and 32 are each provided with coupling portions 38 and 40, respectively, and the coupling portion 40 is bifurcated and extends around either side of the portion 38. The conductors 30 and 32 and their respective coupling portions 38 and 40 are symmetrically disposed with respect to the center line of transmission 42 so that all electric and magnetic fields will have even field symmetry about the center line 42. Due to the symmetrical construction, the filter shown in Figure 5 will not tend to excite unwanted transmission modes, and no mode suppression is required. In order to maintain equal even and odd node impedances Zoe and ZOO for each of the conductors 30 and 32, the dimensions of the interleaved portions 38 and 40 of the transmission lines are chosen so that the total capacitances from each line to the CPW grounds planes 36 will be equal. Since the bifurcated portion 40 is much closer than the inner portion 38 to each of the ground planes 36, the dimensions of the bifurcated portions will generally be much narrower than the enlarged portion 38, i e., the dimension C B will be much less than the dimension A inFigure 5. The line structure shown in Figure 5 can be designed using conformal mapping techniques for a zero conductor thickness, infinite dielectric and equal line capacitance for the pair of coupled lines. The design can be implemented according to the following procedure which can be used to map the three finger structure of Figure 5 from a coupled stripline model. The symmetric coupled line problem revolves around the conformal mapping of a cross sectional capacitance problem, using elliptic integrals. The cell in Figure 6 represents the capacitance problem as a part of a stripline model of the coupled transmission lines in cross section. The cell, shown on the complex plane, is in reality part of a structure periodic along both real and imaginary axes. This is mapped into the coupled CPW line shown in Figure 7. The steps used to solve the symmetric coupledCPW line problem are summarized below. The dimensions of the coupled line are determined from the desired even and odd mode impedances. 1 Express the even and odd mode impedances in terms of the normalized line capacitances Ce s and C0 s using equations 1 , 2 and 3 .EMI5.1 where Zoo, and ZOO are the even and odd mode impedances,EMI5.2 is the free space impedance, E r is the relative dielectric constant of the CPW substrate. 2 Define K2e K2e and K2o K2o from Ce Sand Co using equations 4 and 5 .EMI5.3 3 Find K2 and K20 from K2e K 2e and 20 using the general definitions of the complete elliptic integral given in equations 6 and 7 This will require numeric techniques of the type described inJacobi and Ellistic Functions, L.M.

The filter layout and dimensions are shown in Fig. 8. A 100 mil thickness of resistive material was added to the bottom of the substrate for further odd mode suppression, and the measured filter response agrees very closely with theoretical calculations as shown in Figure 9. The filter according to the present invention may have either semi infinite or finite ground planes on either side of the center conductors, and it should be appreciated that patterns other than that shown inFigure 5 may be used as long as symmetry is preserved.Other modifications could also be made to the disclosed filter structure without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims
