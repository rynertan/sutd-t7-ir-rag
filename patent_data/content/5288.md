## Description
Derivatives of 1 amino fluoren 9 one and their use as herbicides This invention relates to new derivatives of 1 nmino fluoren 9 one and to the preparation thereof. It also relates to new preemergence herbicidal compositions containing at least one new derivative of 1 aminofluoren 9 one. The new derivatives of 1 amino fluoren 9 one of the present invention may be represented by the following formulaEMI1.1 in which R1 and R2 which may be identical or different, represent a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical which may be substituted by a halogen atom and may also form with the attached nitrogen atom a heterocyclic ring, whereas one or two of the symbols R1 and R2 may also represent hydrogen, X and X which may be identical or different represent hydrogen, a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or fluorine, a trihalogenomethyl radical, such as trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl or tribromomethyl radical, or a trifluoromethylsulfonyl CF2S02 radical, with the proviso that X and X do not each represent hydrogen and Y and Y which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a nitro radical. This invention relates particularly to new derivatives of 1 amino fluoren 9 one in which R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl radical and X and X which may be identical or different, represent hydrogen or a halogen atom, with the proviso thatX and X do not each represent hydrogen and Y as well asY represent hydrogen. Among the new derivatives of 1 amino fluoren 9 one of formula I, the following may be cited by way of examples, other compounds according to this invention being described in examples 5 to 37 I dimethylamino 2 fluoro fluoren 9 one 1 amino 2 fluoro fluoren 9 one I dimethylamino 4 fluoro fluoren 9 one 1 methylamino 4 fluoro fluoren 9 one 1 amino 4 fluoro fluoren 9 one 1 dimethylamino 7 fluoro fluoren 9 one. The compounds according to this invention may be prepared as follows. When, in the formula I, R1 and R2 represent an alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical,the compounds of formula I may be prepared by reacting a 1 amino fluoren 9 one of the following formulaEMI2.1 in which X, X , Y and Y have the above meanings, with an alkylating, alkanoylating, carbalcoxylating, cycloalkanecarbonylating, alkenylating or alkynylating reagent. For example, when it is desired to obtain a compound of formula I, in which R1 and R2 represent the same alkyl radical,whereas X, X , Y and Y have the above meanings, the compound of formula II may be reacted with an alkyl p toluene sulfonate or a dialkyl sulfate. When, in the compounds of formula I, R1 represents hydrogen and R2 represents a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical, the compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reacting a compound of the following formulaEMI3.1 in which R2 represents a lower alkyl, alkanoyl, carbalcoxy, cycloalkanecarbonyl, alkenyl or alkynyl radical, X, X , Y and Y have one of the above meanings and A represents an alkanoyl group such as an acetyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl or carbalcoxy or cycloalkanecarbonyl group or a toluenesulfonyl tosyl group, with sulfuric acid. It has been found that the compounds of formula I have remarkable preemergence and postemergence herbicidal properties This invention therefore relates also to the preemergence and postemergence herbicidal compositions containing an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I. The herbicidal compositions according to this invention may be solid or liquid. formulations consisting of at least one compound of formula I and an inert carrier or conventional formulation adjutant. Preparation of said compositions broadly involves admixing an effective amount of the herbicidal agent of formula I and adjutant. Use of said compositions broadly involves application of an effective amount of said compounds of formula I or preferably said herbicidal compositions to the soil containing seeds of the plants or plants to be controlled. Typical formulations include, for instance, dusts, wettable powders, granules, emulsionable concentrates, free flowable concentrates and the like. Dusts are generally prepared by grinding together from about 2 to 98 by weight of at least one active material of formula I with from about 98 to 2 by weight of a solid diluent, such as attaclay, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, fullers earth, silica, talc, pumice, or the like. Granular formulations may be prepared by applying a liquid solution or suspension of the active material to sorptive granular carriers, such as attaclay, kaolin or diatomite granules. Alternatively, they may be mixed with inert carriers and applied to non sorptive granules, such as sand or limestone. Wettable powders are prepared by grinding at least one active ingredient of formula I with a solid carrier, such as used in the dust formulation. In addition to the solid carriers, the wettable powders also contain a dispersing agent and or a surfactant or wetting agent, such as sodium lignosulfonate and or a condensate of polyoxyethylene with an alcohol or an alkyl phenol, namely nonylphenol. The wettable powders are usually dispersed in water and applied as a liquid spray to the area or locus where control of undesirable plant species is desired. The emulsionable concentrate is prepared by dissolving a compound of formula I in a liquid carrier such as a mixture of xylenes containing a surfactant and a wetting agent such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and a condensate of polyoxyethylene with an alcohol or an alkylphenol, namely nonylphenol. The emulsionable concentrate is usually dispersed in water and applied as a liquid spray to the area or locus where control of undesirable plant species is necessary. For use as preemergence or postemergence herbicides, the dusts or liquid sprays containing the active compound of formula I can be applied to the soil shortly prior to or after planting or very shortly after the emergence of weeds. In some cases, the active herbicidal compounds of formula could be advantageously used in mixture with knozen herbicides. This invention also relates to a method for thepre and posiemergence control of undesirable plant species, said method consisting in applying to soil containing seeds of said undesirable plant species a herbicidally effective amount of at least one compound of formula I. The effective amount of said compounds is of about 0.5 to 6 kg hectare, preferably about 2.5 kg hectare, EXAMPLES The preparation of the new compounds of formula I is represented by the following reaction scheme and illus trated by the following non limitative examples 1 to 37.EMI5.1 EMI6.1 The identification characteristics of the various compounds disclosed in the examples have been obtained under the following conditions.
