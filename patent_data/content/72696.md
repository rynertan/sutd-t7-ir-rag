# MAGNETIC BUBBLE MEMORY DEVICE AND METHOD FOR OPERATING THE SAME

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble memory device comprises a magne tic layer having a first region 10, 12, 13 having an easy axis of magnetization extending in a certain direction and a second region surrounding the first region and having an easy axis of magnetization substantially perpendicular to that of the first region, the first region defining a plurality of bubble propagation patterns and a replicate gate RG comprising a stretch conductor pattern 14 to which an electric current is applied so as to stretch a bubble between the propagation patterns 13 and 12 and a cutting pattern adapted to lower the bubble collapse field so as to cut the stretched domain. The cutting pattern according to the invention is formed within the second region, and may be V shaped shown in dotted lines . Alternatively, the cutting pattern is straight, and is over implanted with ions. The replicate gate is operated by applying an operating current pulse to the stretch conductor pattern, the operating pulse comprising a stretch pulse for stretching the bubble and then a cut pulse for cutting the stretched domain.
