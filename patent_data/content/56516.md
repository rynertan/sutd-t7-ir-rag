# Multiplier with frequency converter.

## Abstract
The converter circuit is illustrated as a feed rate control circuit where a DC weight per unit length signal 18 is multiplied by a pulse signal For F 2 proportional to rate of flow of material 12 . This product is further multiplied by a scaler signal 55 to accommodate material delivery systems of various sizes. This product of three quantities is converted into a feedback frequency which is fed back to increase circuit response and linearity. The circuit is independent of any clock frequency and reference voltage variations by using the frequency and reference voltage in both the main input signal and the negative feedback signal.
