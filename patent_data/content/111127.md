## Description
FRAME FOR TIGHTENING FABRIC WOUND ON IT The present invention relates to a frame for tightening fabric wound on it.Frames of the above type currently available on the market are mainly used for transporting fabric from the manufactur er to the user or for compact storage. The said frames are preferably made of metal and come essentially in tvo types.Frames of the first type,comprise a first bar the opposite longitudinal ends of which are fitted utth t w supporting elements each of which has a second bar with its longitudi nal axis perpendicular to that of the first bar. From the centre section of the second bar, four arms branch out ra dally, each of which is fitted with a number of hooks along its entire length for hanging the fabric up by the selvedges.Frames of the second type also comprise a first bar fitted at the ends with two supporting elements, each of..uhich, however, has a centre coupling for housing the correspond ing end of the first bar and from which a number of radial arms branch out with the free end welded to an annular element coaxial with the said centre coupling. Each arm is fitted with a number of hooks on which to hang up the fabric.To wind and secure the fabric round the frames mentioned above, the operators must pull the fabric both lengthwise and crosswise and, at the same time, hang it by the side selvedges on to the innermost hooks on two opposite arms of the supporting elements. When the frame is turned, the fabric is brought up to another two corresponding opposite arms.When the operators get back to the arms the fabric was first wound on to, the fabric is hung on to hooks spaced apart from the previous ones to prevent crushing the pile on the fabric. The distance between the hooks on any one arm depends on the length of the pile.The frames currently available on the market present a number of serious drawbacks.Firstly, as will be clear from the above description, the method by which the fabric is wound does not provide for securing the selvedges firmly on to the hooks. Despite the force exerted on the fabric when it is being wound, the folds in the fabric remain loose owing to the fact that the tip of the hook piercing the selvedge is higher than the part the selvedge is hung on to. This, combined with the weight of the fabric itself, may result in creasing of the folds or even crushing of the pile. The force exerted on the fabric when it is wound, combined with the weight of the fabric itself, may increase the tear on the selvedge caused by the hook with the result that the fold is even more badly creased. The selvedge may even rip completely so that the fold falls off altogether inside the frame.To overcome this problem, a metal wire is currently inserted on each arm to strengthen the hold on the fabric. In time, however, the metal wire, which acts like the wires on an ordinary clothes line, inevitably bends so as to reduce tension on the fabric.What is more, when the height of the fabric is even only slightly greater than the distance between the said supporting elements with the frame positioned vertically, i.e. with the axis of the first bar perpendicular to the supporting face, the selvedge, secured to the supporting element con tacting the supporting face, may slip off the hooks, When the frame is later positioned horizontally, on account of the selvedge coming loose, the folds in the fabric fall down. The selvedges may also be worked loose off the hooks as a result of normal oscillation on the supporting elements around the first bar. All these drawbacks obviously occur more frequently when transporting or storing fabric wound on the frame.As already mentioned, the said draubacks have a negative effect on the appearance of the fabric, particularly those with a thick pile, to the extent that they may be rendered unusable, in addition to the transport and stor age cost involved. Finally, the abovementioned types of frame also make unwinding equally complex.The aim of the present invention is to provide a frame, for tightening fabric wound on it, which is free from the above drawbacks, that is, one providing for winding and unwinding the fabric quickly and easily, and for keeping the folds tight so as to prevent creasing or crushing of the pile during transport or storage.Further aims and advantages will be outlined in the following description. With these aims in view, the present invention relates to a frame for tightening fabric wound on it, the said frame comprising a first bar the ends of which are fitted with two supporting elements having a hollow body fitted on to the corresponding end of the said first bar and a number of arms for supporting the said fabric the longitudinal axes of the said supporting elements being in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the said first bar, characterised by the fact that each of the said arms carries a number of teeth, aligned in relation to one another and each having a cavity that, when in use, the selvedge of the said fabric is inserted between the said teeth and the straight section of a body, one for each of the said arms, is inserted into the said cavities so as to pierce the said selvedges and support them while, at the same time, being supported by the said teeth, so as to tighten the said fabric between the said corresponding opposite arms of the two said supporting elements.A number of preferred arrangements of the present invention will now be described, by way of non limiting examples, with reference to the attached drawings, in which Fig.1 shows a part view in perspective of a first arrange ment of a frame for tightening fabric wound on it Fig.2 shows a side view of a comb element on the Fig.1 frame Fig.3 shows a section of the Fig.2 element Fig.4 shows a part view of part of the Fig.1 frame fitted with a different comb element from that shown in Fig.2 Fig.5 shows a section of the Fig.4 comb element Fig.6 shouts a view of an accessory for the Fig.1 frame Fig.7 shows a part view in perspective of a second arrange ment of a frame for tightening fabric wound on it Fig.8 shows a part section of a first detail on the Fig.7 frame Fig.9 shows a view of an accessory for the Fig.7 frame Fig.1O shows a plan view of a portion of fabric arranged on the Fig.7 frame Fig.11 shows a part view of a third arrangement of a frame for tightening fabric wound on it Fig.s 12 and 13 show a side and front view respectively of a detail on the Fig.11 frame Fig.14 shows a view of an accessory for the Fig.11 frame.Number 1 in Fig.1 indicates a metal frame for tightening fabric wound on it. Frame X comprises a main bar 2 the ends of which are fitted with two elements 3 for supporting the wound fabric. Each supporting element 3 comprises a bar 4 with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of bar 2 the end of which fits inside hollow elements 5 extending from the centre part of bar 4. The ends of bar 2 are fitted into hollow elements 5 by means of wedges 6 forced into the said hollow elements 5 between the inside walls of the latter and the outside walls of bar 2. The ends of bar 4 are fitted with two essentially triangular elements 7 , having a centre portion 8 fitted to the end of bar 4 with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of both bar 4 and bar 2, and two arms 11 with longitudinal axes converging in relation to the longitudinal axis of bar 4 and lying in the same plane as the longitudinal axes of portion 8 and bar 4. The ends of arms 11 are welded close to the centre of bar 4. In Fig.s 11 2 and 3, each arm 11 carries a comb element 12 made from a plate, bent to form a U, from which, prior to bending, strips of material are removed so as to leave two solid top parts 17 and so, after bending, define a number of U shaped teeth t3 with an internal cavity 14 .As shown more clearly later on, the selvedges on the fabric are held temporarily between teeth 13 until a straight section 19 of a metal wire 15 is inserted inside internal cavities 14 on teeth 13 so as to pierce and support the said selvedges. The said metal wire 15 Fig.6 has an open annular head designed to engage part of portion 8 when section 19 is inserted into comb element 12. In Fig.3, the top parts 17 on comb element 12 grip arm 11 to which they are either welded or screwed.Number 21 in Fig.s 4 and 5 indicates a comb element with a different design from element 12. Element 21 is also made from a plate bent to form a U and therefore comprising two solid top parts 22 and a number of U shaped teeth 23 with an internal cavity 24 into which portion 19 of wire 15 is inserted. Top parts 22 are shaped to form a downturned U so that one can accommodate the top part of arm 11 and the other the top part of rod 25 parallel to arm 11. The two ends 26 of rod 25 are bent to form an L by which it is either welded or screwed to arm 11. Between top parts 22, a spacer 27 is forced to clamp element 21 to arm 11 ith out welding or using assembly screws.Part 21 may sometimes consist of more than one piece, each comprising one or more teeth a . The reason for this arrangement is to enable teeth 23, or sets of two or more teeth, to be spaced as required. When in use, the fabric is wound in the same way as on pres ently sold frames with the difference that, when being wound, the selvedges on the fabric are held temporarily tight between teeth 13 or 23 on frame 1 by means of a special device covered by another patent. Once the fabric has been wound, portion 19 of wire 15 on each arm 11 is inserted into cavities 14 or 24 so as to pierce the selVedges on the fabric which, even when the said device is released, remain taut between the two supporting elements 3 . Of course, depending on the length of the pile on the fabric, one or more teeth 13 or 23 will be skipped when winding the fabric so as not to crush the pile.Number 31 in Fig.7 indicates a frame for tightening fabric wound on it, the said frame comprising a main bar 32 the two ends of which are fitted with two elements 33 for supporting the wound fabric. Each supporting element 33 comprises a bar 34 the longitudinal axis of which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of bar 32 the ends of which are forced into hollow elements 35 extending from a centre part of each bar 34 . The ends of bar 32 are secured inside hollow elements 35 by means of two wedges 36 forced inside each of the said hollow elements 35 between the inside walls of the latter and the outside walls of bar 32.The latter has a rectangular section and each wedge 36 an essentially L shaped section so that it can be inserted along one edge of bar 32 and grip parts of adjacent walls on it. Wedge 36 is tapered with a tailpiece 37 , on the end outside hollow element 351 for engaging or releasing the said wedge 36 from hollow element 35 when knocked.The longitudinal ends of bar 34 in Fig.7 are fitted with two bars 38 bent into essentially triangular shape, each of the said bars having a centre portion ql fitted to the end of bar 34 with its longitudinal axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of both bar 34 and bar 32, and two arms 42 with their longitudinal axes converging from opposite sides with the longitudinal axis of bar 34 and lying in the same plane as the longitudinal axes of portion 41 and bar 34.The ends of arms 42 are welded to bar 34 close to its intermediate section. Each of bars 34 is also fitted with another two straight arms 43 for each of bars 38. The said arms 43 are located inside the triangle formed by bar 38 and are parallel to arms 42. Each arm 43 has a first end welded to bar 34 and a second end welded to portion 41 on bar 38.As shown in Fig.s 7 and 8, each arm 42 and 43 is fitted with a comb element 45 for tightening the fabric between the two opposite supporting elements 33 . Each comb element 45 comprises a top part 46 , bent in the shape of a U and gripping a portion of arms 42 or 43, and a bottom part with a number of teeth 47 , each with the free end bent to form a cavity 48 . As shown more clearly later on, the selvedges on the fabric are held temporarily between teeth 47 on each corn element 45 until a straight section ski of a metal wire 52 , bent in the shape of a U, is inserted into cavities 48, aligned with one another, on each comb element 45 so as to pierce and support the said selvedges.The said metal wire 52 Fig.9 has a straight centre section 53 and two straight side sections 5 1 which fit into the cavities 48 of two adjacent comb elements 45 supported by paras lel arms 42 and 43 respectively.As shown in Fig.10, the fabric on each pair of parallel arms 42 and 43 is folded with an inside angle of 1350 by one of arms 42 and 43 and subsequently with an inside angle of 1350 by the other arm 43 or 42. Along the crosswise folds formed on arms 42 and 43 between the two opposite supporting ele vents 33 , the pile on the fabric is turned towards the outside of frame 31 at an angle of 450. In short, instead of winding the fabric by folding it on each comb element with an inside angle of 900, the fold is halved by folding the fabric on each pair of parallel arms 42 and 43, at an inside angle of 1350 on the first arm 42 or 43 and then at another 1350 on the remaining arm 43 or 42 .The fabric is wound in the same way as on frame 1 in Fig.1. Once the fabric has been wound, for each pair of parallel, adjacent arms 42 and 431 portions 51 of metal wire 52 are inserted simultaneously into aligned cavities 48 on two comb elements 45 on the said parallel arms 42 and 43. When inserted, portions 51 pierce the selvedges on the fabric inserted between teeth 47 so that, when the said temporary holding device is removed, the fabric remains taut between the two supporting elements 33 . Of course, depending on the length of the pile, one or more teeth 47 will be skipped when winding the fabric to prevent crushing the pile. Number 61 in Fig.11 indicates a frame for tightening fabric wound on it, the said frame comprising a bar 62 the opposite ends of which are fitted with two wheel like elements 63 for supporting the fabric. Each supporting element 63 has a centre coupling 64 , which fits on to the corresponding end of bar 62, and a number of radial arms 65 each longitudinal axis of which defines, in the same plane, the same angle in relation to the longitudinal axis of arm 65 before and after it, and a right angle in relation to the longitudinal axis of bar 62. A first end 66 of arms 65 is secured, eag. welded, to centre coupling 641 while a secondend 67 is secured, e.g. welded, to an annular element 68 coaxial with coupling 64.Though the number of arms 65 pro vided in Fig.11 is eight, this in no way limits the scope of the present invention in that the minimum number of arms 65 indispensable is three, naturally at the same angle in relation to one another. The end of bar 62 can be screwed, wedged or otherwise secured inside coupling 64.Each arm 65 in Fig.s 12 and 13 is similar to a comb element.In fact, each arm 65 is made with a number of slots 71 to form a number of teeth 72 aligned to one another and each having a cavity 73 indicated by a dotted line in Fig.13.As shown in more detail later on, the selvedges on the fabric are held temporarily in slots 71 until a straight portion 74 of metal wire 75 is inserted into cavities 73 on teeth 72 so as to pierce the said selvedges and support the fabric. The said metal wire 75 Fig.14 has an open annu ar head 76 for engaging part of annular element 68 when portion 74 is inserted into cavities 73. At each end 67 of arms 65, annular element 68 has a hole 77 coaxial with a hole in the said end 67. Through these holes, straight portion 74 of metal wire 75 fits through cavities 73 on teeth 72.The fabric is wound in the same way as on frames 1 and 31.Once the fabric has been wound, on each arm 65, portion 74 of the corresponding wire 75 is inserted into cavities 73 of teeth 72 so as to pierce the selvedges on. the fabric held in slots 71. The said device is then released, the same be ing no more than an element with a number of arms, each with a number of grips for gripping the selvedges on the fabric which, even when the device is released, remains taut between the two supporting elements 63 in that portions 74 on wires 75 are supported by teeth 72 to prevent them from bending. of course, depending on the length of the pile on the fabric, one or more teeth will be skipped when winding the fabric, so as not to crush the pile.The advantages of the present invention will be clear from the description given.Firstly, the winding systems described in connection with frames 1, 31 and 61 overcome all the drawbacks posed by support and hook frames, e.g. tearing or unhooking of the selvedges or falling folds resulting in creasing or crushing of the pile. As compared with frame 1, frames 31 and 61 provide for a softer fold on the fabric Fig.1O . Obviously, the crosswise folds will be less evident so that the fabric falls easily back into place when unwound or used. Another point worth noting is the negligible effect on the pile which, along the crosswise folds, no longer opens 90o but by half that angle on frame 31 and by an angle depending on the number of arms 65 on frame 61.Furthermore, between adjacent arms 42 and 43 on frame 31 or adjacent arms 65 on frame 61, the fabric may be arranged parabolically so as to reduce the effect on the pile or fabric even further.To those skilled in the art it will be clear that changes can be made to frames 1, 31 and 61 described and illustrated herein, without departing from the scope of the present invention.In particular, the comb element on frame 1 may be secured to arm 11 in any number of ways and the comb element itself be designed differently from the ones described providing it comprises a number of U shaped teeth or teeth comprising an annular portion for accommodating portion 19 of wire 15.The said design variations depend on production time and cost. For example, the teeth may be annular or made of one piece with a hole for accommodating the said portion 19. The comb element may even be made by winding a helical metal wire round arm 11, or by bending an undulated metal wire in the form of a U or in more than one piece fitted with one or more teeth. Finally, arms 11 may be made in the same way as arms 65 on frame 61, that is, with built in teeth with cavities aligned to one another.What has been said in connection with the comb elements on frame 1 also applies to comb elements 45 on frame 31. Arm 42 or 43 on frame 31 may be made from a bar bent in the shape of a U and either screwed or welded to the other arm 43 or 42 . Another arrangement of arms 42 and 43 could comprise a bar bent to form a quadrilateral with two parallel sides fitted with two comb elements 45 and the other two sides connected to bar 34 and the end of portion 41. In this arrangement, though portions 51 form part of a single U shaped piece, this in no way means that portions 51 may not be disconnected from each other or each have a head designed for connecting it to frame 31. On frame 61, the number of arms 65 may differ, as may the way in which the ends of bar 62 are secured to the two supporting elements 63 . Teeth 72 may be designed differently providing they comprise an annular portion for accommodating portion 74 of wire 75. Furthermore, arms 65 may be de signed differently with a comb element similar to the one described on frame 1 or one of its variations already mentioned. Teeth 72 and, in particular, cavities 73 may protrude from the space formed by element 68. Finally, though frames 1 31 and 61 are preferably made of metal, they may be made, even only partly, of plastic and suitably strong board.
