# Forklift vehicle.

## Abstract
A self propelled forklift vehicle 10 having a frame 12 formed by two spaced parallel longitudinal frame members 14, 16 and a rear transverse frame member 18 . The fork carriage 26 is movable forwardly and rearwardly on the longitudinal frame members 14, 16 along the path of the machine, and carries a fork tower 28 and forks 118, 118 . A front gate 352 causes discharge of the contents of a pallet onto the ground when the fork carriage 26 is retracted. The serrations or barbs 370 on the tines 128 prevent the pallet 258 from disengaging from the fork times at this time.
