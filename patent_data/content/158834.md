# Chemical selective sensors utilizing admittance modulated membranes.

## Abstract
A chemical selective sensor system utilizes admittance modulated membranes to detect the presence of chemical or chemical species in a fluid 16 . The sensor system includes a film or membrane 72 adapted to pass ions when selected chemicals which are to be detected are present at the membrane surface. The membrane is attached to a hyd rophilic layer of material 68 which, in turn, is attached to a transformer layer 64 which is deposited on a base substrate 60 . When the selected chemicals are present in the fluid 16 , the membrane 72 interacts with the chemicals to allow ions, also in the fluid 16 to permeate the membrane. This ion current in the membrane 72 is transformed or con verted by the transformer layer 64 to an electronic current which is measured by an electrical circuit coupled to the transformer layer 64 of material. An alternating current source 24 is coupled at one terminal to the transformer layer 64 and to the measuring circuit 32 , and at another terminal to a circuit return electrode 36 .

In the drawings The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed description presented in connection with the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of a chemical selective sensor system including an amplifier circuit, made in accordance with the principles of the present invention FIG. 2 shows a side, cross sectional view of the active sensor electrode of the FIG. 1 schematic FIG. 3 is a perspective, representational view of a multisensor embodiment made in accordance with the principles of the present invention and FIG. 4 is a perspective, representational view of a different multisensor embodiment. Referring now to the drawings Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a chemical selective sensor system which includes an active sensor electrode 4 and a reference sensor electrode 8, both M the inputs of a differential amplifier 12. The active sensor electrode 4, which will be discussed in detail later, develops a change in electrical current in response to the presence of certain materials or chemical species in a fluid 16 held.. in a container 18 into which the sensor electrode is immersed. The reference electrode 8 develops a current which may be substantially zero as a reference against which the current developed by the active sensor electrode may be compared. Although the two electrodes 4 and 8 are shown as being separate, it should be understood that they could be constructed on the same solid state substrate as could the associated circuitry. The active sensor electrode input of the differential amplifier 12 is also coupled by way of a variable resistor 20 to one side of an alternating current source 24. The reference electrode input of the differential amplifier 12 is coupled by way of a resistor 28 also to the one side of the alternating current source 24. This configuration is a well known bridge differential amplifier circuit. The output of the differential amplifier 12 is coupled to a detection circuit 32 for detecting the level of the output of the amplifier. For example, the detection circuit 32 could be any conventional voltmiter. To complete the circuit from the alternating current source 24 through the fluid 16 to the active sensor electrode 4, a return electrode 36 is provided and this electrode is coupled to the other side of the alternating current source 24. The return electrode 36 could be made of any type of electrical conductive material such as platinum, a silver silver chloride compound, etc. The active sensor electrode 4 and reference electrode 8 are both encapsulated in a fluid impervious coat 40 and 44 respectively so that the fluid 16 contacts the electrodes only through exposed windows 48 and 52. That is, only the outermost layer of each of the electrodes is exposed to the fluid 16. The active sensor electrode 4 of FIG. 1 is shown in a side, cross sectional view in FIG. 2 in a representative fashion. That is, the thicknesses shown for the different layers is exaggerated for purposes of illustration. The active sensor electrode includes a base substrate 60 upon which the other layers of the sensor are deposited and upon which the electrical components are placed. Attached to the base substrate 60 is a transformer or convertor double layer 64 including an electronic conductor layer of material 64a and a second layer of material 64b. The function of the transformer layer 64 is to convert ionic current, i.e., ions received at the outer surface of the second layer 64b, into electronic current which is applied to an electrical conductor 76 which extends through the base substrate 60 to the metal layer 64a. The layer 64b is a compound capable of both ionic and electronic conduction and capable of exchanging ions with adjacent layers. For example, layer 64a could be silver and layer 64b could be silver chloride. Alternatively, layer 64a could be lead and layer 64b could be lead chloride. It should be mentioned at this point that the chemical or material to be detected is not the ion which will be transported to layer 64b. Rather, such ions are simply the mechanism for determining when the material to be detected is present in the fluid 16. Such material triggers the active sensor electrode to allow the ions in the solution to be transported to the layer 64b. This will be further explained later. Attached to the transformer layer 64 is a layer of hydrophilic material 68, such as a hydrogel material, e.g., polyhema poly hydroxyethyl methacrylate , polyacrylamide, etc. The function of this layer is to provide a stable hydration environment to enable

## Description
CHEMICAL SELECTIVE SENSORS UTILIZING ADMITTANCE MODULATED MEMBRANESThis invention relates to a solid state electrochemical sensor for selectively sensing chemical species in a fluid.Solid state electrochemical sensors for detecting, measuring and monitoring chemical species and properties e.g. ion activity and concentration, concentration of enzymes, substrates, antibodies, antigens, etc. generally fall into two categories potentiometric sensors which utilize some type of chemical layer which is sensitive to ions or some neutral molecules see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,020,830 , and amperometric sensors in which a mass transport limited current provides information about the concentration of reducible or oxidizable species see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 2,913,386 . The latter type of sensors typically suffer from lack of selectivity, that is, from an inability to detect the presence of a particular chemical species in a fluid in which other chemical species may also be present.However, in spite of these and other difficulties with presently known solid state electrochemical sensors, there is still a great deal of interest in finding a practical, solid state, miniaturized sensor which can selectively detect the presence of various chemical species.It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved solid state electrochemical sensor which may selectively detect and measure chemical properties.It is another object of the invention to provide a compact, accurate, stable and yet easy to manufacture chemical selective sensor.It is also an object of the invention to provide such a sensor which can be adapted to selectively detect a variety of chemical species.It is an additional object of the invention to provide an integrated solid state electrochemical sensor for detecting chemical species in either a liquid or gaseous environment. The above and other objects of the invention are realized in a specific illustrative embodiment thereof which includes a solid state electrochemical sensor which utilizes a film or membrane adapted to pass ions when selected materials, which are to be detected, are present at the membrane surface. In particular, the electrochemical sensor includes a base substrate, and a layer of material attached to the base substrate for producing electrical current in response to the transport of ions to the layer this layer actually transforms or converts ionic current to electronic current.

The membrane includes gating molecules which interact with the chemical species to thereby allow ions from the fluid to permeate the membrane. An alternating current source is coupled to the layer of material and also to an electrode which functions as a return electrical path. A detection circuit is coupled to the layer of material and to the alternating current source for detecting electronic current produced in the layer of material and thus for detecting the concentration of the selected chemical species. 13.

A solid state electrochemical sensor for selectively sensing chemicals in a fluid comprising a base substrate, a transformer layer of material attached to the base substrate for transforming ionic current received at the layer into electronic current, a membrane attached to the transformer layer for transporting ions to the layer, said membrane including gating molecules at a plurality of spaced apart locations on the membrane, where the gating molecules at each location selectively bind to different chemicals to be detected to thereby allow ions in the fluid to permeate the membrane at the respective location, an alternating current source, one terminal of which is coupled to the transformer layer, an electrode coupled to the other terminal ot the alternating current source, and means coupled to the transformer layer for detecting the electronic current developed in the layer. reversible exchange of the transported ion. The layer 68 also provides a suitable surface for deposition of a film or membrane 72 to next be discussed.The film or membrane 72, which is attached to the layer 68, provides the selectivity enabling detection of certain chemicals or chemical species. This membrane may be either a natural lipid bilayer film obtained from plants or animals or a synthetic phospholipid film produced by the well known Langmuir Blodgett process. Either the natural or the synthetic film would include so called gating molecules which control the opening and closing of the film to the transport of ions. The gating molecules are incorporated onto the membrane 72 by exposing the membrane to a solution containing such molecules. Articles describing lipid membranes of the type used as layer 72 include Thompson,Michael, et al, Lipid Membrane Dipole Perturbation and Chemoreception as Models for Selective ChemicalSensing , Analytica Chimica Acta, Vol. 47, 1983, andToro Goyco, E., et al, Detection of Antisulin Antibodies with a New Electrical Technique Lipid MembraneConductometry , Biochemical and Biophysical ResearchCommunications, Vol. 23, No. 3,1966, pages 341 345.The multilayer active sensor electrode of FIG. 2, as described ealier, is encapsulated in a fluid impervious material 80 to prevent interference with the electrochemical detection process and to prevent corrosion of the layers of the sensor electrode.An exemplary sensor electrode for detecting acetylocholine is constructed of a silicon wafer base substrate 60 coated with a metallic layer 64a of from 2000 to 5000 angstroms, a sodium tungsten bronze layer 64b of from 2000 to 5000 angstroms, a hydrogel layer 68 of about 10,000 angstroms, and then the membrane or film i2. The gatinq molecules are acetylcholine receptors which interact with acetylcholine in the fluid 16 to allow sodium ions, also in the fluid either naturally or artificially , to permeate gate into the membrane 72.The system of FIG. 1 detects the presence of certain chemicals or materials in the fluid 16 in the following manner. When the active sensor electrode 4 is placed in the fluid, the chemical to be detected for example, acetylcholine , binds to the gating molecules on the membrane 72 for example acetylcholine receptor and this enables ions in the fluid for example sodium ions to permeate the membrane. This permeation or transport of ions in the membrane, which has the effect of increasing the admittance of the membrane, reaches the transformer layer 64 where the ionic current is transformed to an electronic current.If layer 64a is silver and layer 64b is sodium tungsten bronze, then the reaction would be as follows EMI10.1 The electronic current developed in the transformer layer 64 is carried by conductor 76 to the differential amplifier 12, where the difference between that current and the current developed by the reference electrode 8 is amplified and supplied to a current detection circuit 32.The reference electrode 8 is constructed essentially identical to the active sensor electrode 4 except that gating molecules are not provided in the outer film so that any current which may be developed by the reference electrode does not change when this electrode is subjected to the chemicals to be detected or the gating molecules in the outer film are irreversibly inhibited so that a substantially fixed reference current is developed regardless of the chemicals or materials present in the fluid 16.By employment of an alternating current source 24, net chemical changes at each of the layer interfaces are avoided. Further, this avoids potentiometric measuring approach which requires a charge accumulation over time before an accurate reading can be had of the concentration of the chemical to be detected.Use of the alternating current source enables the use of a small amplitude modulation signal 5 to 50 millivolts which is less than the threshold breakdown voltages of the membrane 72. Finally, with the employment of the alternating current source, the nature of the ionic to electronic current transformer layer is less important in that the qated ion may be sodium and the transformer structure may include.a chloride ion material and vice versa.FIG. 3 shows a perspective, representational view of a sensor electrode having multiple sensors. In particular, the electrode includes a base substrate 100, a double transformer layer 104, a hydrophilic layer 108 and a plurality of membranes 112 which are attached to the hydrophilic layer 108 and spatially separated from one another. Each of the membranes 112 would incorporate different gating molecules to enable the detection of different chemicals or chemical species.FIG. 4 shows an alternative embodiment of a multisensor electrode. This electrode, likewise, includes a base substrate 200, a double transformer layer 204 and a hydrophilic layer of material 208. With this embodiment, however, a sinqle chemical selective membrane or film 212 is provided, with different areas 216 on the membrane surface incorporating different gating molecules, for allowing detection of different chemicals or chemical species. That is, each of the areas 216 on the membrane 212 interact with different chemicals or chemical species to allow permeation of ions into those areas in the membrane 212. In the manner described for FIGS. 3 and 4, multiple sensors can be provided in a single substrate and used to detect a number of different chemicals or chemical species.It is to be understood that the above described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and the appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements.
