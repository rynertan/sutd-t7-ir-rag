## Description
PHOTOCHROMIC COMPOUNDS AND PHOTOSENSITIVE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SUCH COMPOUNDS This invention relates to photochromic compounds and to photosensitive compositions and materials containing such compounds, for use for instance in the optical recording art. Photochromic photosensitive spiropyran materials are known to have a number of advantages 1 high resolution can be obtained without involving any particulate property 2 no specific developing and fixing treatments are needed 3 thin film formation is possible because of high intensity of the formed colour and 4 erasion and rewriting are possible.Accordingly, attempts have been made to apply these materials to various recording and memory materials and also to duplicating materials.Especially in recent years, application of these materials as recording media, e.g.optical video discs, in which a laser beam is used to record and reproduce information signals while making use of features 1 and 4 indicated above, has been expected to take place. Known photochromic, photosensitive spiropyran materials have been absorption wavelength, in the coloured state, ranging at most from 400 nm to 700 nm. For laser beam recording or reproducing purposes, it is essential to use a gas laser such as an Ar or He Ne laser. As is well known, smallsize, light weight semiconductor lasers have recently been developed. So, there is a tendency for semiconductor lasers to take the place of gas lasers for recording and reproducing purposes. Semiconductor lasers actually applied to laser recording or reproducing operations have emitting wavelengths ranging from 780 to 850 nm. At present, semiconductor lasers which emit at shorter wavelengths have been extensively developed. It is considered that there is a high possibility of putting into practice semiconductor lasers emitting at about 700 nm in the very near future see, for example, Present State and Future of Semiconductor Laser Recording , Journal of Japanese PhotographicAssociation 44 2 1981 , by Fujitaro Saito, and Development and PresentState of Visible Light Semiconductor Lasers , Optronics No. 9 , 41 1982 . In order to apply photochromic photosensitive spiropyran materials as a recording medium for semiconductor laser recording and reproducing purposes, the materials should have good absorption characteristics with respect to light having a wavelength higher than used in the prior art cases and, in particular, a wavelength higher than 700 nm. As is known in the art, the following spirothiopyran compound has a good absorption characteristic, in the coloured state, with respect to light having the range of wavelengths mentioned above see J. Phys. Chem. 72, 997 1981 , by H.S. Becker and J. Kolc .EMI2.1 Although this compound have a high absorption characteristic in the coloured state with respect to light having a wavelength ranging from 600 to 850 nm when placed in a 3 methylpentane solution at 77 K, it does not form any colour at normal temperatures, even in solution or in a polymer film.The compound is able to develop a colour only at temperatures lower than OOC and the colour, once developed, disappears immediately after the compound returns to a normal temperature. Thus, this compound cannot in practice be used. Photochromic compounds embodying the invention and disclosed hereinbelow have a high absorption characteristic with respect to light having a wavelength higher than 700 nm, are stable in colour formation, are able to repeat colour formation and bleaching, depending on the temperature and ultraviolet UV irradiation, and can be used for recording by semiconductor laser. The present invention provides a photochromic compound of the general formula EMI3.1 in which R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, each ofR2, R3, R4 and R5 independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, a halogen atom, a nitro group, a cyano group or a dimethylamino group, and each of R6, R7 and R8 independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group havign 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or a halogen atom. Preferably, in formula I above, R1 is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and each of R2 and R4 to R8 represents a hydrogen atom.Such preferred compounds are represented by the following general formulaEMI3.2 in which R1 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, a nitro group, a cyano or dimethyl amino group. Specific examples of photochromic compounds embodying the invention are indicated in the Examples and Table 1 appearing hereinbelow. The present invention also provides a photochromic composition which comprises a mixture of 50 to 97 wt of a film forming polymer and 50 to 3 wt of a photochromic compound of formula I above. The photochromic compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following reaction scheme A EMI4.1 In other words, compounds having the formula I above can be prepared readily and in high yield by refluxing, in ethanol, a 1 alkyl 3,3 dimethyl 2 methylene indoline II and a 5 nitro thiosalicylaldehyde III . The starting compound II can be prepared according to the reaction scheme B given below, by alkylating 2,3,3 trimethylindolenine IV at the N position with an alkyl halide R1X in which X represents a halogen atom, thereby forming a salt V , and subsequently treating the salt with an alkali.EMI4.2 For the alkylation at the N position, dialkylsulphates, alkyl toluenesulphonates and the like may also be used. When R3 in compound Il is CH3 2N and each of R2 and R4 to R8 is hydrogen, i.e. the compound II is 5 dimethylamino 1,3,3 trimethyl2 methyleneindoline, it is necessary to use a specific technique for its preparation. This preparation process is believed first to have been devised by us. The compound is prepared according to the following reaction scheme C in which 5 amino 2,3,3 trimethylindolenine is reacted with methyl iodide in the presence of a hindered amine, e.g. 1,2,2,6,6 pentamethylpiperidine, to obtain a quaternary amine, and demethylating the quaternary amine by heating it with sodium n propyl alcohol ate. This is particularly described in Example 5 appearing hereinbelow.EMI5.1 The compound I prepared according to the reaction scheme A using a compound II in which R3 is a dimethylamino group has the feature that it is very stably coloured by UV irradiation. The above indicated 2,3,3 tri methylindolenine IV can be ordinarily obtained on the basis of a Fischer s indole synthesis, in which a substituted phenylhydrazine or hydrochloride thereof and 3 methyl 2 butanone are heated under acidic conditions. Alternatively, a substituted aniline and 3 methyl 3 bromo 2.butanone may be heated to obtain the compound iV . Part of this preparation process is believed to be novel and is particularly described in Example 3 appearing hereinbelow. Preparation of 5 nitrothiosalicylaldehyde III used in the reaction A is not known. This compound III can be prepared according to the reaction scheme D or E given below. 1 Method of converting a halogen atom of an aldehyde compound carrying a halogen atom at the ortho position into an SH group see Example 1 EMI6.1 This reaction readily proceeds when R6, R7 and R8 are all hydrogen atoms such compound being readily available , but synthesis of substituted 5 nitro 2 mercaptobenzaldehydes is very difficult. In this case, a method using the following reaction scheme E is used. 2 Method of converting the OH group of salicylaldehyde into an SHEMI6.2 Dimethylcarbamate VIII is prepared from the salicylaldehyde VII , followed by heating to cause a rearrangement reaction of 0 and S to obtain a compound IX and subsequent alkaline hydrolysis to give 2 mercaptobenzaldehyde III . The reaactions of this series are known per se. However, it is believed not known to apply these reactions so as to obtain a compound of formula III . The reaction scheme E is advantageous in that synthesis of the starting salicylaldehyde is easy and yields at the respective reaction stages are high. Accordingly, for the synthesis of 5 nitrosalicylaldehyde having substituents, use of a process according to the reaction scheme E is favourable.In this process, the reaction can be caused to proceed so that compound VII can be converted into compound IX in one step, as will be seen in Example 4 appearing hereinbelow. The photochromic, photosensitive compounds or materials embodying the present invention, which have once been coloured, may be bleached or returned to their original colouriess state by heating to 60 to 80 C or by irradiation by visible light having a wavelength higher than 500 nm. UV irradiation enables the material to be coloured. Thus, the material can stand repeated use. These compounds have very wide utility in various fields. For instance, they can be used as a medium for semiconductor laser recording and reproducing purposes and also as various recording materials, such as memory materials, duplication materials, photosensitive materials for printing, recording materials for cathode ray tubes, and photosensitive materials for holography. Also, the materials can be utilised as materials for optical filters, display, masking, actionometers, decoration and the like. Photochromic compounds embodying the invention are soluble in various solvents, including alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and isopropyl alcohol, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone, ethers such as ethyl ether, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, esters such as ethyl acetate and n butyl acetate, benzene, toluene, xylene, n hexane, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, chloroform, and mixtures thereof. When the compound is to be applied as a photochromic material or medium, it can be dissolved in a solvent along with a polymer material. The resulting solution can be used for film formation or applied to a support and dried. Alternatively, the compound may be kneaded along with a polymer material without the use of any solvent and subjected to film formation. The polymer materials useful in the practice of the invention may be any materials which are miscible with the compounds of the general formula I and which have excellent film forming ability. Examples of such polymers include polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylbutyral, cellulose acetate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyacrylonitrile, urethane resins, epoxy resins, polyesters, phenolic resins and phenoxy resins. Of these, chlorine containing polymers are preferable because of higher stability after colour formation.The amount of the compound represented by the general formula I in a photosensitive composition comprising a polymer material is generally in the range of from 3 to 50 wt , preferably from 5 to 30 wt B. Amounts smaller than 3 wt are unfavourable because this gives lower optical density. On the other hand, amounts larger than 50 wt result in precipitation of the compound I from the polymer material. The present invention will now be particularly described by way of the following examples, which are illustrative.Example 1 Preparation of 1 , 3 , 3 trimethyl 6 nitrospiro 2H 1 benzothiopyran 2,2 indoline EMI8.1 5 nitro 2 mercaptobenzaldehyde, EMI8.2 which is one of starting materials, was prepared according to the following reaction schemeEMI9.1 59 of 2 chloro 5 nitrobenzaldehyde was added to 10 cc of ethanol, followed by heating under refluxing conditions. Thereafter, a mixture of 4.66 g of Na2 S. 9H2 0 and 0.62 g of S was heated to obtain Na252. The thusobtained Na2 2 was added to a boiling solution of 2 chloro 5nitrobenzaldehyde in ethanol over 15 minutes. After completion of the addition, 10 cc of a solution containing 1.08 g of NaOH in 95 ethanol was further added over 30 minutes.After completion of the addition, the mixture was cooled and poured into iced water consisting of 30 g of ice and 400 cc of water, after which insoluble matter was filtered off. The resulting filtrate was neutralised with HC1, thereby obtaining a yellow precipitate. The precipitate was collected by filtration. Since the yellow precipitate contained impurities, it was dissolved by heating it in 20 cc of ethanol, to which was added a solution containing 1.08 g of NaOH in 93 ethanol, followed by removing insoluble matter by filtration. The filtrate was again neutralised with HC1 and cooled to obtain yellow crystals of the intended 5 nitro 2 mercaptobenzaldehyde. The crystals were collected by filtration and dried for use in a subsequent reaction. The yield was 3.15 g 64 and the melting point was 84 to 88 0C. Thereafter, 1.6 g of commercially available 1,3,3 trimethyl 2 methyleneindoline and 2 g of the 5 nitro 2 mercaptobenzaldehyde obtained in the manner described above were placed in 100 cc of methanol and heated under refluxing conditions for 2 hours. The solution was concentrated and methanol was added thereto, thereby precipitating yellow crystals. The crystals were recrystallised from benzene methanol to obtain the intended 1 ,3 ,3 trimethyl 6 nitrospiro L 2H 1 benzothiopyran 2 2 indolineg . The yield was found to be 1.1 g 35 and the melting point was 178 to 1790C. The 5 nitro 2 mercaptobenzaldehyde prepared as the starting material was analysed by proton NMR spectroscopy. TMS tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard and CDC13 chloroform d1 was used as a solvent.

The maximum absorbance at the wavelength of 680 nm was about 0.6. The same sample had a significant absorption at 780 nm and the rate of the absorbance based on the absorbance at the absorption maximum wavelength max was 47 . For comparison, the above procedure was repeated using 1 ,3 ,3 trimethyl 6 nitrospiro t2H 1 benzopyran 2 2 indoline , which is a known spiropyran compound. The colour formation characterisitc of the resulting photosensitive film was determined. It was found that max was 580 nm and the end of absorption at the long wavelength side took place at 700 nm.Example 2 Preparation of 5 methoxy 1 n hexyl 3 ,3 di methyl 6 nitro 8 methoxyspiro 2H l benzothiopyran 2,2 indoline EMI11.1 3 methoxy 5 nitro 2 mercaptobenzaldehyde,EMI11.2 which was one of starting materials, was prepared in the following manner.10 g of 3 methoxy 5 nitrosalicylaldehyde and 11.4 g of 1,4 diazabicyclo t 2,2,2 3 octane were dissolved in DMF dimethylformamide .

When generation of hydrogen stopped, a solution of 8 g of dimethylthiocarbamoyl chloride in 10 cc of DMF was added, followed by reaction at 40 C for 15 minutes and then at 80 0C for 1 hour.After cooling, iced water was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting crystals were filtered and recrystallised from benzene ethanol. 7.3 g yield 51 of a compound of the following formula was obtained.EMI16.2 5 g of the compound was dissolved in 25 cc of ethanol, to which was added 23.5 cc of 4N NaOH aqueous solution, which was followed by reaction at ambient temperature for 2 hours while blowing N2 gas. The reaction mixture was rendered acidic by the use of dilute hydrochloric acid and the resulting yellow crystals were filtered and dried to obtain 3.72 g of 3 chloro 5 nitrothio salicylaldehyde yield 99 , melting point 84 to 890C . 2.5 g of the salicylaldehyde and 2.5 g of 5 methoxy 1,3,3 trimethyl2 methyleneindoline were reacted in the same manner as in Example 2 and the resulting product was separated to obtain 3.3 g of the intended 5 methoxy 1 ,3 ,3 trimethyl 6nitro S chlorospiro 2H 1 benzothiopyran 2,2 indoline 1 yield 67 .

Ind.Co., Ltd were dissolved in 100 parts by weight of a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and cyclohexanone in a mixing ratio by volume of 1 1. The solution was spin coated onto a quartz glass plate and dried in vacuo at 80 C for 2 hours to obtain a sample having a 1 micron thick photosensitive film. The sample was irradiated by ultraviolet light of about 360 nm from a 500 W super high pressure mercury lamp made by Ushio Electric Co., Ltd through a UV 360 filter made by Toshiba Corp. , whereupon the sample developed a green colour. The coloured sample had an absorption maximum wavelength of 650 nm, at which a saturation absorbance was 0.6. The absorbance was found to be 0.43 at 720 nm and 0.14 at 780 nm. The coloured sample was bleached when heated to 800C and was again coloured by irradiation by ultraviolet light. This phenomenon could be repeated many times.Example 5 Preparation of 5 dimethylamino 1 ,3 ,3 trimethyl 6 nitrospiro C 2H 1 benzothiopyran 2,2 indolinej EMI17.1 5 dimethylamino 1,3,3 trimethyl 2 methyleneindoline EMI17.2 was prepared as follows. 3.74 g of 5 amino 2,3,3 trimethylindolenine, 6.619 of 1,2,2,6,6 pentamethylpiperidine and 18.27 g of methyl iodide were dissolved in 40 cc of DMF. The solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 hours. The resulting crystals were washed with an acetone solution ctaining 6 DMF and then with acetone, which was followed by drying and the addition of 150 cc of n propyl alcohol containing 23.5 g of sodium. The mixture was refluxed for demethylation over 17 hours and the n propyl alcohol was removed under reduced pressure.Water was added to the reaction solution, which was extracted with ether to obtain 4.219 of 5 di methylamino 1,3,3 trimethyl 2 methyleneindoline yield 91 . 3 9 of the thus obtained indoline and 3 9 of the 5nitrothiosalicylaldehyde obtained in Example 1 were heated in 40 cc of ethanol for 4 hours, followed by treatment in the same manner as inExample 2 to obtain 2.4 g of the intended 3 dimethylamino 1 ,3 ,3 trimethyl 6 nitrospiro L 2H 1 benzothiopyran 2,2 indoline yield 45 , melting point 166.5 0C to 1670C . For identification, proton NMR spectroscopy was used. The compound of this example was used to make a polymer film in the same manner as in Example 4. When the film sample was irradiated byUV light, a blackish purple colour developed. The absorption spectra were as follows the absorption maximum wavelength was 620 nm and the saturation absorbance at that wavelength when the sample was irradiated by UV light and the absorbance of the coloured sample reached saturation was 0.62. The absorbance was 0.42 at 720 nm and 0.13 at 780 nm. When the coloured photosensitive film sample was heated to 80 C, absorption of light having a wavelength over 700 nm disappeared. This absorption reappeared upon irradiation by UV light. The colour formation of the sample was very stable. Thiopyran type spiropyran compounds having various substituents as indicated in Table 1 were prepared in the same manner as in Examples 1 to 5. The compounds were identified by proton NMR spectroscopy. The compounds were used to make photosensitive films in the same maner as inExample 4. The films were irradiated to such an extent that colour formation reached saturation. The results are shown in Table 1. Absorbances at certain wavelengths were absorbance values of 1 micron thick photosensitive films. From the results, it will be seen that the compounds embodying the present invention have high absorptions at wavelengths over 700 nm. As will be understood from the foregoing, thiopyran base spiropyran photochromic compounds embodying the present invention, in which the oxygen atom in the benzopyran structure of a known spiropyran compound is replaced by a sulphur atom and which have an NO2 group at the 6 position, become sensitive to light of a wavelength longer by about 00 nm than known spiropyran compounds and have high absorption characteristics with respect to light having a wavelength of over 700 nm.
