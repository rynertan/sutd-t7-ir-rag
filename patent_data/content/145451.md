# FLARE

## Abstract
A Coanda flare having an outlet adapted to direct high pressure fuel gas over the director surface of the Coanda body so as to entrain surrounding air into the fuel gas flow. A water injection nozzle is located upstream of the outlet and located within the high pressure fuel gas supply line. By injecting water into the fuel gas prior to its emergence from the outlet, a flare having reduced noise and radiation characteristics is achieved.
