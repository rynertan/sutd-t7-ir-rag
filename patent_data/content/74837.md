## Description
4 SUBSTITUTED PYRIDINE CATALYSTS Background of the Invention F This invention relates generally to the field of pyridine chemistry, and more particularly to certain pyridine derivatives which have shown specific utility as catalysts in acylations and alkylations and related reactions. The work of catalysts is well documented. The ability of such substances to bring about a change in the rate of a chemical reaction without themselves being consumed or changing their own chemical identity is highly beneficial in both laboratory.and commercial applications. In pyrdine chemistry, pyridine itself as the parent compound to a large family of homologues and other derivatives has been shown to function as a catalyst and solvent for certain types of reactions, although reaction times have often been long and coupled with low yields.Typical of these are acylation type reactions which as used in this application is understood to mean not only what may traditionally be termed an acylation, in which an acyl radical is incorporated into an organic molecule by substitution, but also recognized related reactions such as, for example, formylations, carbamoylations, phosphorylations, arylsulfonylations, lactonizations, cyanylations, esterifications and others. Also typical are alkylation type reactions which as used in this application is understood to mean an alkylation in the classical sense of introducing an alkyl radical into an organic compound by substitution or addition, as well as recognized related reactions such as, for example, trialkylsilylations, tritylations and others. With these acylation type and alkylation type reactions, as with other reactions in general, the search for more efficient, chemically reactive catalysts is a continuous process. In this search, 4 dimethylaminopyridine has been found to effectively catalyze acylations and alkylations as well as several similar reactions. G. Hoefle, W. Steglich and H.Vorbrueggen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 17, 569 1978 .It has been reported that 4 dimethylaminopyridine is approximately 104 times more active than pyridine itself which was formerly used as a catalyst and solvent, as mentioned above. Referring to specific reactions, for example, tertiary alcohols are notoriously difficult to acylate cleanly and in high yield owing to steric hindrance. However, treatment of linalool with acetic anhydride and 4 dimethylaminopyridine in triethylamine was reported to give an 80 yield of linalyl acetate after standing for 14 hours at 240C. Mesitol, a sterically hindered phenol more accurately identified as 2,4,6 trimethylphenol, has also been reported as being acylated smoothly in high yield by acetic anhydride in the presence of 4 dimethylaminopyridine. G. Hoefle and W.Steglich, Synthesis, 619 1972 . The versatility and power of 4 dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst are best exemplified by consideration of its use in processes of particular commercial importance. For example, 4 dimethylaminopyridine has been claimed to accelerate the formation of polyurethanes from p toluene diisocyanate and glycols British Patents Nos.990,635 and 990,633 as well as the formation of polyepoxides British Patent No. 1,201,756 and polyamides British Patent No. 1,207,673 . Production of an ampicillin by treatment of 6 isocyanatopenicillinate with D N benzyloxycarbonyl 2 phenylglycine was also reported as catalyzed by 4 dimethylaminopyridine in German Offen. No.2,155,152. Commercial production was also reported of phosphorothioate esters with insecticidal and acaricidal activity of pyridines, pyrazines Belgian Patent No.832,047 and pyrimidines British Patent No. 2,011,415 . Notwithstanding these advantages experienced with 4 dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst, disadvantages have also been encountered with its use. One disadvantage is that the compound is a solid. This causes problems both with laboratory use and particularly with industrial applications where the procedure for adding a solid to a batch or continuous reaction can be difficult.Consequently, the compound would generally be used with a co solvent in such circumstances to lessen at least some of this problem. However, difficulty is then often experienced in separating out the desired product, especially if basic, from the catalyst when working up the reaction. Moreover, recovery of the 4 dimethylaminopyridine catalyst itself can often prove to be extremely troublesome under such conditions. These difficulties would not exist with a liquid catalyst that has the same efficacy as 4 dimethylaminopyridine in reactions such as the above examples. No such catalyst was known to applicants prior to their present discovery.While it is true that pyridine is a liquid, it is far less effective a catalyst as mentioned above. Summary of the Invention With this background, one aspect of the present invention comprises as a new composition of matter, a composition selected from the group consisting of 4 4 methylpiperidino pyridine, 4 hexamethyleneiminopyridine, 4 4 ethylpiperidino pyridine and 4 4 methylpiperazino pyridine, and having the respective formulas as set forth in the Description section to follow. The above compositions are liquid and have shown good catalytic ability in acylation type and alkylation type reactions far superior to pyridine and at least comparable to 4 dimethylaminopyridine, but without the disadvantages encountered with these compounds. Preliminary investigations have also been encouraging in evidencing potential for further uses of applicants compositions in both catalytic and possibly other applications. In addition, applicants are hopeful that further testing will uncover other liquid compositions within this same family which will prove to have similar advantages in catalytic and other uses. Description of the Preferred Embodiment As mentioned above applicants have discovered new compositions of matter which are identified as follows 4 4 methylpiperidino pyridine having the formula EMI5.1 4 hexamethyleneiminopyridine having the formula EMI5.2 4 4 ethylpiperidino pyridine having the formula EMI5.3 and 4 4 methylpiperazino pyridine having the formula.EMI6.1 These compositions are liquid and have been isolated and identified as having boiling points in the range of 155 175 C at pressures in the range of 2 5.5 mm Hg as indicated for each composition in the specific examples below. As for utility, each of applicants compositions have proven themselves far superior to pyridine and at least comparable to 4 dimethylaminopyridine as catalysts in acylation type and alkylation type reactions.Quantitative comparison of the catalytic ability of each of applicants compounds with 4 dimethylaminopyridine was accomplished using the method disclosed in Connors andAlbert, J. Pharm. Science, 62, 845 1973 . Under standard conditions, for example, progress of the acylation of isopropanol with acetic anhydride at 400C after 5 minutes was 92 in the presence of 4 dimethylaminopyridine and 88 in the presence of 4 4 methylpiperidino pyridine. As a second example, the acylation of the sterically hindered alcohol t butanol with acetic anhydride at 69oC for a period of 2 hours was 38 complete using 4 dimethylaminopyridine as catalyst. This was compared to 37 acylation under the same conditions using applicants 4 4 methylpiperidino pyridine. As a third example, the tritylation, or as it is more completely termed the triphenylmethylation, of benzyl alcohol using applicants 4 4 methylpiperidino pyridine catalyst yielded 89 product after being allowed to stand overnight at room temperature under nitrogen. Similar results at least comparable to those achieved with 4 dimethylaminopyridine have been obtained using each of applicants other three compositions. In each reaction tested to date, applicants catalysts have functioned effectively without any attendant complications from the use of a co solvent or other additive or from reisolation and recovery of the catalyst after the reaction was complete. From these successes, it is reasonable to expect that each of applicants compositions will function equally well as a catalyst in other acylation type and alkylation type reactions such as those mentioned earlier in the application. For the purpose of promoting a better understanding of the disclosure herein and the nature and scope of applicants discovery, the following specific examples are given of a method of preparing each of applicants compositions and then using each as a catalyst in an acylation type and an alkylation type reaction.
