# Method of making clayware.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of making clayware by firing a composition containing clay and a boron containing flux, wherein the flux is a synthetic alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal aluminosilicate having the crystal structure of a zeolite and containing boron entrapped within that structure. The boronated zeolite flux is simple to prepare in a form in which it can be used directly in the manufacture of clayware, especially earthenware.
