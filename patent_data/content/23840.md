# Heat curable aqueous coating composition and bath for depositing the same.

## Abstract
Aqueous coating compositions which cure on baking and which are especially adapted for cationic electrocoating. The compositions comprise an aqueous dispersion of a reactive resin solubilised by salt formation, for example an amine func tional copolymer solubilised with an acid, and a water insoluble bisphenolformaldehyde ether used as the curing reactant for the reactive resin.
