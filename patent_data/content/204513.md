Equation 1 illustrates the reaction of sulfonyl isocyanates and isothiocyanates of Formula II with the appropriate heterocyclic amines of Formula III to give the desired sulfonylureas and sulfonylthioureas of Formula I. wherein The reaction of Equation 1 is best carried out in an inert aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile at a temperature between 0 and 82 C. A catalytic amount of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane DABCO may be used to accelerate the reaction. In cases in which the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent, they may be isolated by simple filtration. When the products are soluble, they can be isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with solvents such as 1 chlorobutane, diethyl ether or ethyl acetate, and filtration. Compounds of Formula I can be prepared as shown below in Equation 2 by the reaction of sulfonamides IV with the phenyl ester of the appropriate carbamic acid or thiocarbamic acid of Formula V, in the presence of an equimolar quantity of a tertiary amine base such as 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,0 undec 7 ene DBU . wherein The reaction shown in Equation 2 is best carried out at 25 C in a solvent such as dioxane or acetonitrile for 1 2 hours under an inert atmosphere as described in European Patent Application No. 70,804 published January 26, 1983 .

The sulfonamides of Formula IVa are isolated either by filtration, in which case the ammonium chloride by product is removed by washing with water, or extraction into an organic solvent such as methylene chloride. Drying and evaporation of the solvent affords the sulfonamides IVa, which are usually sufficiently pure to be carried directly on to the next step. Sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII can be prepared by one or more of the methods shown below in Equations 7, 8 and 9. The reaction of an appropriately substituted N arylhydroxylamine of Formula IX, as shown in Equation 7, and subsequent displacement with sulfur dioxide in the presence of cupric or cuprous chloride yields the desired sulfonyl chloride of Formula VIII. The reaction of Equation 7 can be carried out by combining the appropriate arylhydroxylamine with aqueous concentrated hydrochloric acid and acetic acid and adding an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite at 10 to 10 C. After being stirred for 10 minutes to two hours the reaction mixture is added to a mixture of acetic acid, a catalytic amount of cuprous or cupric chloride and excess sulfur dioxide at 5 to 20 C.

B. Johnson and J. M. Sprague, The requisite tetrazole substituted intermediates can be prepared by various methods depending on the nature of the aromatic ring in J J 1 to J 6 systems on which the tetrazole is substituted and the nature of the other substituents present on J J 1 to J 6 . These intermediates can be prepared by one skilled in the art by the methods referred to in the following reviews on tetrazole chemistry F. R. Benson, Heterocyclic Compounds R. C. Elderfield, Ed. The heterocyclic amines of Formula III in Equation 1 above can be prepared by methods known in the literature, or simple modifications thereof, by those skilled in the art. For instance, EP A No. 84,224 published July 27, 1983 and W. Braker et al., The 5,6 dihydrofuro 2,3 d pyrimidine 2 amines, the cyclopenta d pyrimidin 2 amines III, A is A 2 and the 6,7 dihydro 5H pyrano 2,3 d pyrimidin 2 amines III, A is A 3 can be prepared as described in EP A No. 15,683. The furo 2,3 d pyrimidin 2 amines III, A is A 4 are described in EP A No. 46,677. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 5, are described in EP A 73,562. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 6 are described in EP A 94,260. In addition, general methods for preparing aminopyrimidines and triazines have been reviewed in the following publications Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide or carbonate . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g. alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchange cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid, e.g., p toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like. The preparation of the compounds of this invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples. To 5 g of 1 2 hydroxylaminophenyl 5 methyl 1H tetrazole in 12 mL of 37 hydrochloric acid and 5 mL of acetic acid at 0 5 C was added 2.3 g of sodium nitrite in 10 mL of water. The resultant solution was stirred at 5 to 5 C for one hour and then added portionwise, with stirring, to a mixture of 25 mL of acetic acid, 0.5 g of cupric chloride and 5 mL of liquified sulfur dioxide at below 5 C. After stirring for two hours, during which time the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, it was poured into 150 mL of ice and water and extracted twice with 150 mL of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride solution was washed three times with 100 mL portions of water, two times with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate followed by single washes with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and 100 mL of water. The methylene chloride solution was then dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered to yield a solution containing the desired sulfonylchloride. This solution was used without further work up to prepare the sulfonamide of Example 2. Twenty five mL of 28 ammonium hydroxide was added to the methylene chloride solution obtained from Example 2 and the mixture was stirred for two hours and concentrated To 5g of a mixture of 5 2 hydroxylaminophenyl 2 methyl 2H tetrazole and 5 2 hydroxyaminophenyl 1 methyl 1H tetrazole dissolved in 12 mL of 37 hydrochloric acid and 5 mL of acetic acid was added with stirring 2.3 g of sodium nitrite dissolved in 10 mL of water at 5 to 5 C.

By using the procedures described in the foregoing equations and examples or modifications thereof, one skilled in the art can prepare the compounds shown in the following tables. In Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are somtimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Inter science, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning. Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example In the following examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled until all the solids are essentially under 50 microns, reblended, and packaged. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. A slurry of wettable powder containing 25 solids is sprayed on the surface of attapulgite granules while tumbling in a double cone blender. The granules are dried and packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The active ingredient is dissolved in the solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the blender is allowed to run for a short period and then the granules are packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The salt is added directly to the water with stirring to produce the solution, which may then be packaged for use. The active ingredient is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the material is warmed to evaporate the solvent. The material is allowed to cool and then packaged. The ingredients are blended and milled to pass through a 100 mesh screen. This material is then added to a fluid bed granulator, the air flow is adjusted to gently fluidize the material, and a fine spray of water is sprayed onto the fluidized material. The fluidization and spraying are continued until granules of the desired size range are made. The spraying is stopped, but fluidization is continued, optionally with heat, until the water content is reduced to the desired level, generally less than 1 . The material is then discharged, screened to the desired size range, generally 14 100 mesh 1410 149 microns , and packaged for use. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a material essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm opening . The concentrate may be formulated further if necessary. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns. The material is sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 screen and then packaged. The ingredients are thoroughly blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in size. The material is reblended and then packaged. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 5 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The active ingredient is blended with attapulgite and then passed through a hammer mill to produce particles substantially all below 200 microns. The ground concentrate is then blended with powdered pyrophyllite until homogeneous. Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are highly active preemergent or postemergent herbicides or plant growth regulants. They have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Some of the compounds have utility for selective weed control in crops such as corn, rice, wheat, barley and rape. Alternatively, many of the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of about 0.001 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate, phenoxyacetic acid and bipyridylium types, as well as other sulfonylureas. They are particularly useful in combination with the following herbicides. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow. Seeds of crabgrass Two round pans 25 cm diameter by 12.5 cm deep were filled with Sassafras sandy loam soil. One pan was planted with blackgrass. Two round pans 25 cm diameter by 12.5 cm deep were filled with Sassafras sandy loam soil. One pan was planted with blackgrass, sugar beets, nutsedge, rape, crabgrass, sicklepod, teaweed, jimsonweed, velvetleaf, and giant foxtail. The other pan was planted with wheat, barley, cotton, rice, corn, soybeans, wild oats, cocklebur, morningglory, johnsongrass, and barnyardgrass. The two pans were sprayed preemergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent. Treated plants and controls were maintained in the greenhouse for 28 days, then all treated plants were compared to controls and visually rated for plant response. Response ratings are based on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 no effect, and 100 complete control. A dash response means no test. Response ratings are contained in Table B.
