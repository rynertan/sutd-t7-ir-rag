# Separation process.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for fractionation of compounds, which in essentially non polar solvents form mixed or co micelles, and hence cannot normally be fraction ated by membrane filtration. By dissolving a mixture of such compounds in a solvent system in which selective micelles formation occurs, and contacting the solution under press ure with a semipermeable membrane to separate the mixture into a permeate and a retentate, fractionation of the compound mixture can be achieved, i.e. a fraction enriched in one of said compounds can be recovered from the permeate and or retentate by removing solvent therefrom. The new process is in particular useful for fractionating phosphatides containing mixtures into a fraction enriched in phosphatidyl choline by ultrafiltration of a solution of the mixture in a solvent system comprising an essentially non polar solvent and a polar solvent, e.g. hexane ethanol, etc. through a semipermeable membrane, and recovering a fraction enriched in phosphatidyl choline from the permeate. A fraction enriched in phosphatidyl inositol can be recovered from the retentate.
