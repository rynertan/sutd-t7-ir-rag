# CARDIOVASCULAR MONITORS

## Abstract
A cardiovascular monitor comprises a watch casing, a timing circuit 3 in the watch casing for supplying timing signals, a transducer 2 associated with the watch casing for sensing arterial blood pulses and supplying an electric signal in dependence thereon, electrodes 7 associated with the watch casing for sensing electrocardiographic R waves and supplying an electric signal in dependence thereon, a circuit 5 for deriving from the transducer signal and a timing signal an electric signal representing heartbeat rate, a circuit 4 for deriving from the electrode signal, the transducer signal and a timing signal an electric signal representing mean blood pressure, and a display 6 on the watch casing for displaying the time of day in dependence on a timing signal, heartbeat rate in dependence on the heartbeat rate signal, and mean blood pressure in dependence on the blood pressure signal. Alternatively, only the time of day and the heartbeat rate, or only the mean blood pressure may be displayed.
