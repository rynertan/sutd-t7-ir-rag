# Paper coating apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A trailing blade paper coating apparatus comprises means 2, 3 providing a resilient curved surface for supporting a mov ing web of cellulosic material 1 , an applicator for a paper coating composition, a trailing blade 11 which is biased towards and in contact with the moving web of cellulosic ma terial 1 , and a flexible blade 5 mounted so that, in operation of the trailing blade paper coating apparatus, the flexible blade 5 is in contact with a web of cellulosic material 1 to be coated at a location which is upstream relative to the trailing blade 11 and downstream relative to the applicator for a coating composition. In the method of applying a paper coating composition 9 to the surface of a moving web of a cellulosic material 1 using the trailing blade paper coating apparatus, it is preferable that the time taken for a fixed point on the web of cellulosic material 1 to travel between the line of contact with the flexible blade 5 and the line of contact with the trailing blade 11 is not longer than 15 milliseconds.
