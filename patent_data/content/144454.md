# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SWITCHING THREE PHASE LOADS WITH AN OHMIC INDUCTIVE CHARACTER, IN PARTICULAR ASYNCHRONOUS MACHINES AND TRANSFORMERS TO THE MAINS

## Abstract
The invention relates to the control of the switching process of three phase loads with ohmic inductiv caracter, particularly asynchronous machines wherein the phase of the mains voltages is observed and for switching the phases controllable switching elements are used. According to the invented method one phase voltage is selected, and follow ing a switch on order in a vicinity of a zero crossing of it a line voltage represented by the difference of the other two phase voltages is connected, and observing the connected line voltage in the vicinity of a very next zero crossing of it the selected and remaining phase voltage is switched on. An apparatus for realizing the process comprises con trollable switching elements 2 inserted in at least two phase lines A,B and provided with a triggering unit 3 , a comparator unit 5 and a mains voltage converter 4 for detection of zero crossings. The comparator unit 5 is connected to the three phase mains via the mains voltage converter 4 and a logic unit 6 for controlling the proper time sequence of the switching process is provided. The logic unit 6 is connected to inputs 5a, 5b of the comparator unit 5 , and its outputs 6a, 6b are connected to the triggering units 3 controlling the switching elements 2 . The logic unit 6 has further inputs for switching in and out the load.
