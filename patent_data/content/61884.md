# Optical fibre sensor.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting changes in chemical or physical parameters, comprises a sensing optical fibre 18 comprising a core surrounded by a sensitive cladding whose absorption spectrum varies with changes in the chemical or physical parameters when these are applied to the cladding, and transmissive optical fibre means 15, 16 comprising a core surrounded by an insensitive cladding for connecting at least one end of the sensitive optical fibre to a remote light source 19 and a remote detector 21 , the core of the sensing optical fibre 18 having substantially the same diameter as the core of the transmissive fibre means 15, 16 and the refractive indices of both the sensitive and the non sensitive claddings being less than the refractive indices of the cores of both the sensing fibre 18 and the transmis sive optical fibre means 15, 16 . The transmissive optical fibre means can be two optical fibres, one extending from each end of the sensitive fibre to be connected at their remote ends to the light source and detector respectively, or a single optical fibre extending from one end of the sensitive fibre whose other end is made reflective, the single transmis sive fibre being connected to both sources and detector using a beam splitter. Apparatus in the configuration of a probe having a reflective sensitive end, with one or more transmissive fibers extending for connection to a remote source and detector, provides a very slim flexible sensor which is useful where space is restricted, e.g. as a medical catheter probe.
