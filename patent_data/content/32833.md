# EGG YOLK CONTAINING COMPOSITIONS IN WHICH THE EGG YOLK HAS BEEN AT LEAST PARTIALLY REPLACED

## Abstract
In a product normally containing egg yolk, wherein the egg yolk is not heat set, at least 50 of a portion of said egg yolk is replaced, the percentage being on a dry weight basis of the egg yolk replaced, with a composition comprising from 50 to 100 of partially soluble modified whey solids derived as a precipitate from a process which comprises either 1 adding a divalent metal ion to a cheese whey solution and adjusting the pH to a value between 6 and 8.0 to cause precipitation of the modified whey solids or 2 adjusting the pH of a cheese whey solution containing at least 20 acid cheese whey to a value of between 6.0 and 8.0 to cause precipitation of the modified whey solids and from 50 to 0 of another whey protein containing pro duct, said percentages being based on the dry weight of said composition. This invention is particularly effective in food compositions such as sauces and dressings.
