# A method and means for applying a heat exchanger in a drill hole for the purpose of heat recovery and storage.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method and a means for applying a heat exchanger in a drill hole 2 in rock, loose soils or the like for the purpose of heat recovery or storage, achieving a more efficient heat transfer between the defining surface 4 of the drill hole and a heating medium contained in the heat exchanger, wherein at least one heat exchanging element 1 is lowered into the drill hole 2 and expanded in substantially radial direction so that the heat exchanging ele ment 1 is thus caused at least partially to be substantially in contact with the defining surface 4 of the drill hole.
