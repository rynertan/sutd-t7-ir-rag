# Linear motor.

## Abstract
A linear motor includes a movable element 5 and a stationary element 4 whose facing surfaces are provided with magnetic teeth. The movable element 5 comprises a pair of iron cores 51, 52 spaced apart in a direction of movement of the movable member 5 and each provided with a plurality of groups of magnetic teeth. The groups of magnetic teeth of each core 51, 52 are in phase with each other but extend in a direction transverse to the direction of movement of the movable element 5 . The groups of teeth on one core are 180 out of phase with the groups of teeth on the other core and the teeth on the stationary member 4 have a phase with respect to the phase of the groups of teeth of one of the iron cores 51, 52 which is shifted as much as
