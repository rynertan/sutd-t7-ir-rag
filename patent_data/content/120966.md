## Description
SPECIFICATION PROCESS FOR PREPARING BENZOPHENONE DERIVATIVESField of the Invention This invention relates to a process for the preparation of benzophenone derivatives and particularly a process, which comprises treating 1 ,1 bis aryl 2,2,2 trichloro ethanol of Formula IEMI1.1 wherein Ar stands for a non substituted or substituted phenyl group, with an alkali. Benzophenone derivatives may be represented by the Formula ItEMI1.2 wherein Ar is as defined above.Background of the Art Generally, benzophenone derivatives are used as agricultural chemicals, drugs and intermediates for dyestuffs and particularly, halogenated benzophenone derivatives are useful as materials for resins having good properties such as thermal resistance, oxidation resistance and light resistance.For the preparation of benzophenone derivatives there have been known, for example, 1 a process of effecting aFriedel Crafts reaction between an aromatic acid chloride and an aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such an anhydrous aluminum chloride and anhydrous ferric chloride P.H. Gore, Friedel Crafts and Related Reactions Vol. III, pl, ed. by G.A. Olah, John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1964 , 2 a process including reacting an aromatic hydrocarbon with carbon tetrachloride in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride and then effecting hydrolysis J.P. Picard et al, Can. J. Research, 28B, 56 1950 and 3 a process of oxidation of a 1, 1 bis 4 halogenated phenyl 2,2 dichloroethylene compound with chromic acid H.L. Bradlow et al, J.Am.Chem. Soc., 69, 662 1947 0. Grumitt et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 67, 155 1945 O.G. Bacheberg et al, J. Chem.Soc., 1945, 803 . However, in case of process 1 anhydrous aluminum chloride in amounts equimolar to the aromatic acid chloride is required and in case of process 2 anhydrous aluminum chloride in an equimolar amount to the aromatic hydrocarbon is used. The separation of aluminum chloride is too complicated to reuse it and further, anticorrosive equipment is required. In case of process 3 it is relatively easy to convert 1, 1 bis aryl 2,2,2 tri chloroethanes to the ethylene derivatives thereof by alkali treatment, in which the former is prepared by reaction of an aromatic hydrocarbon with chloral for example, O.Gruhitt et al, J.Am Chem. Soc., 67,155 1945 .It is however, e trerzely troublesome to use a large amount of chromic acid in the oxidation reaction and the treatment of waste fluid generated requires much expenses. Therefore conducting the process 3 in a commercial scale is confronted with various difficulties.Disclosure of the Invention An object of this invention is to provide a process for preparing benzophenone derivatives acivantageously in a commercial scale. In accordance with this invention, there is provided a process for bhe preparation of benzophenone derivatives which comprises treating 1,1 bis aryl 2,2,2 trichloroethanol with an alkali. According to this invention, 1,1 bis aryl 2, 2 ,2 tri chloroethanol which is available industrially at low costs is used for the alkali treatment and as a result benzophenone derivatives can be prepared with a high yield. Therefore there are no problems of environmental pollution as compared with the conventional methods for preparing benzophenone derivatives using a large amount of aluminum chloride and chromic acid. Thus the process of this invention is very advant√¢eeous industrially. Best Node for Carrying Out the Invention The starting material used in this invention is 1,1 L aryl 2,2,2 trichloroethanol which may be represented byFormula IIIEMI4.1 wherein R stands for hydrogen, halogen, an alkyl group, a phenyl group, an alkoxy group or a phenoxy group.Examples of the aryl group in Formula III include phenyl, 21 fluorophenyl, 4 chlorophenyl, 4 bromophenyl, 4 iodophenyl, 4 methylphenyl, 4 ethylphenyl, h lsopropylphenyl, t t but phenyl, 4 phenylphenyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, 4 ethoxyphenyl, h butoxyphenyl and 4 phenoxyphenyl. These 1,1 bis aryl 2,2,2 tricloroethanols are easily prepared by, for example, chlorinating 1,1 bis aryl 2,2,2 trichloroethane which is obtained by reaction between an aromatic hydrocarbon and chloral O.Grumitt et al, J.Am. Chem.Soc., 67,155 1945 W.Awe, retch. Pharm., 285,162 1950 Chef. Sbstr. 45, 583k 1953 and hydrolysing the resulting product US Patent o. 2,812,280 and No 2,812,360 . The alkali which may be used in this invention includes hydroxides of an alkali metal including ammonia or alkaline earth metal carbonates thereof, for exairple sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potas carbonate and ammonium carbonate. The alkali is generally used in the form of an aqueous solution or may be used in the form dissolved in an alcohol such as retanol and ethanol.The amoUnt of the alkali is within a molar ratio of 0.2 10, preferable 0.4 5 relative to 1,1 bis aryl 2,2,2 trichloro ethanol In the process of this invention, the reaction may be carried out in an aqueous solution or in an organic solvent. Exa.ples of the organic solvent include hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, and chlorobenzene, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and butanol, ethers such as diethyl ether tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, ketones suchas acetone and methyl ethyl kEtone and ethyl acetate, N, dimethyl formamide and dimethyl sulfoxide and other organic solvents which are stable against an alkali. These solvents may be used in mixture of two or more in mixture with water. The reaction is carried out by suspending or dissolving 1,1 bis aryl 2,2,2 trichloroethanol in water or an organic solvent and dropping an alkali solution while maintaining at desired temperature or by dropping the solution of l,l bis aryl 2,2,2 trichloroethanol to the alkali solution or by charging the two reactants simultaneouslyThe reaction temperature is comprised between 0 and 200t, preferable 10t and 1500C. After effecting the reaction under the indicated temperature and time conditions, the resulting precipitates are filtered to obtain end products Also, the product, when dissolved in the solvent, is charged into water and then subject to after treatment such as filtration.Simultaneously with the progress of reaction chloroform is formed, which is removed during or after the reaction. The benzophenone derivatives obtained according to this invention are, for example, benzophenone, 4,4 difluoro benzophenone, 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone, X,4 dlbromobenzo phenone, 1 4,4 diiodobenzophenone, 4,4 dimethylbenzophenone, 4,4 diethylbenzophenone, 4,4 diisopropylbenzophenone, 4,4 di t butylbenzophenone, 4,4 diphenylbenzophenone, 4,4 dimethoxybenzophenone, 4,4 diethoxybenzophenoen and 4,4 diphenoxy benzophenone.
