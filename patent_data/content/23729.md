## Description
PROCESS FOR DETINNING TIN COATED SCRAPThis invention relates to the recovery of tin from tin bearing material such as old cans, tin piate, lacquered tin sheet waste, and the like, i.e. in general any tin plated or tin coated iron material, which for convenience will herein after be referred to as tin scrap.Heretofore it was common practice to detin tin scrap by subjecting it to the treatment with aqueous alkaline solutions. Either an alkaline chemical process is applied by which tin is removed as stannate and then processed towards the production of tin, or an alkaline electrolytic process is carried out to obtain metallic tin directly.In the alkaline detinning process such as presently operated in industrial practice, see for instance B.D.Linley, Proceedings of the first international conference on tin 1976 , an oxidizing agent is present and greatly increases the rate of dissolution of tin. A small percentage of oxidizer nitrate, nitrite, ... is added to a weak solution of sodium hydroxyde and this detinning agent is able to strip tin from electrolytic tin plate in 1l hours in dynamic conditions at temperatures exceeding 600C. All such alkaline processes need to perform at rather high temperatures, generally between 60 and 1050C.Moreover, such processes have to be carried out for some hours, at room temperature, in order to obtain sufficient detinning of scrap.Attempts to carry out detinning of scrap in acidic solutions gave rise to considerable problems which had to be avoided by adding iron dissolution inhibitors to the detinning solutions see for instance U.S. patent 3,490,898 . It has now been found surprisingly that the drawbacks of known techniques may be avoided, and that a substantially complete detinning of iron scrap can be achieved in very short times, without external heating Ol the detinning medium, by using a very simple chemical process based upon oxido reduction reactions, in which tin dissolves out preferentially. In particular, the new process of detinning tin plated and or tin coated iron scrap, according to the invention, mainly comprises contacting the iron scrap with an aqueous or organic solution containing an effective amount of ferric ions. The aqueous and organic solutions of ferric ions may consist of any readily available iron salt solution, but most appropriately consist of iron chloride or iron sulfate solutions. Organic solutions may consist of any conventional polar organic solvents such as ketons, esters and halogenated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons. According to an additional feature of the invention the atomic ratio of ferric ions present in the total amount of the detirning solution to the total amount of tin present in the iron scrap to be detinned is at least 4. According to another and or further feature of the invention, the ferric ion content of the detinning solution ranges from 0.01 M liter to saturation, and is ideally comprised between 0.75 and 3.6 M liter, which latter concentration corresponds to common commercially available solutions. In a preferred embodiment of the invention ferrous ions resulting from the dissolution of tin and iron are regenerated to ferric ions, either by blowing air or oxygen into the detinning solution, or by electro lytic anodic oxidation, thus improving the tin dissolution performance of the detinning solution. In order to improve such regeneration of ferric ions from ferrous ions it may prove useful to add acid to the reaction mixture, for instance hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. An important further feature of the invention lies in the fact that one may very suitably carry out the detinning operation without any external heating of the reaction medium, and thereby obtain substantially complete detinning, including tin alloys removal in very short times. In another preferred embodiment of the. invention, lacquer or varnish layers on the iron scrap have been previously removed, either by a heating operation or by means of organic solvent mixtures. According to the invention, the solution resulting from the detinning operation may very suitably be used for electroplating of iron or for tin chloride or tin sulfate production. Particularly interesting embodiments of the invention involve continuous detinning of iron scrap, by means of a solution which is continuously regenerated by reoxidation of ferrous ions and by removal of tin, and or involve regeneration of the solution in an electrolytic cell,in which tin is deposited at the cathode and ferrous ions are reoxidizedsto ferric ions at the anode,said cathode and anode being separated by a porous membrane or diaphragm. The new detinning process according to the invention provides a simple and economical chemical process, based upon oxido reduction reaction wherein tin dissolves out preferentially allows very effective detinning at approximately room temperature and in very short time allows regeneration of the chemical agent used for detin ning, combined with tin recovery avoids the use of expensive alkaline agents,and perform with chemical by products derivating from metallurgical activity and involves the following advantages chemical detinning of scrap in aqueous solutions contai ning Fe ions, coming from ferric chloride or ferric sulfate, is practically complete at room temperature in a few minutes at most use of Fe ions leads to more ready and complete detin ning than would be expected by using more effective oxidizing agents such as perchlorate, permanganate, persulfate, etc... iron dissolution during the detinning process is not disadvantageous as it contributes to the production of more chemical detinning agent, which may meet unavoidable reagent losses ferrous ions produced during detinning reaction can easily be reoxidized to the ferric state the process can very easily be made continuous, for example by continuously supplying tin scrap by means of rotative perforated drums. It has been found particularly suitable to use as detinning medium, a commercial aqueous solutions containing Fe ions, such as ferric chloride aqueous solutions containing 4096 in weight of ferric chloride 3.6 M liter . Under these latter conditions, detinning of scrap is complete in a few minute s at ambient temperature, including stripping of tin iron alloys present at the iron tin interface of tin plated steel. Tin recovery can most appropriately be achieved from the obtained solutions by an electrochemical process by which in an electrolysis cell comprising cathodic and anodic compartments separated by a porous diaphragm porous filter cloth, porous glass, ... it is possible to recover tin onto the cathode and to reoxidize ferrous ions to ferric state in the anodic compartment tin can be recovered onto a cathode consisting of tin sheet or tin plated steel whereas in the anodic compart ment, ferrous chloride can be reoxidized in ferric chlo ride onto an anode such as graphite anode the porous separator between the two compartments, avoids that produced ferric ions contact deposited tin again and redissolve it replenishing amounts of detinning agent are produced, owing to the fact that some iron coming from the tin plated steel is dissolved by ferric ions during detinning. Thus the same detinning bath can be recirculated and increasing concentrations of tin in the bath can easily be reached. Ferric chloride reoxidized at the anode of the electrolytic cell flows out of the cell by means of an overflow and can be recycled to the initial detinning bath. The various features of the invention as well as further details thereof will be illustrated by means of the following comparative tests and examples.
