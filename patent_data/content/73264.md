## Claims
CLAIMS 1 Stabilizer on the ground for poles, characterized by the fact that it permits laying line and surface structures at ground le vel by means of a stabilization device with penetration throu gh helical point and upper transversal base integral with the spike in order to determine a penetration wedge space. Continu ing the penetration beyond the adhesion condition of the base to the ground, its compaction is obtained in progression. This is possible because, when the spike is progressing, the quantity of ground in the penetration wedge is increased and, the refore, a gradual expansion of the mass contained in the rele vant space is obtained to determine a total effect of ground compaction. In this way, the stabilization is attained of the pole integral with such foundation device. 2 Stabilizer on the ground for poles, according to the previo us claim, characterized by the fact that, in a version, the stabilization device employs rod spike 1 with penetration poi nt 2 having a helical relief 3 for penetration and an upper plate 4 for ground compacting and passing hole 5 for the tran sversal mounting of bar 6 apt to bring spike 1 into rotation for the fitting and disconnecting phases. 3 Stabilizer on the ground for poles, according to the previo us claims, characterized by the fact that version a3 is fore seen which employs pole 1a with base 2a, point 3a and helical part 4a suitable for allowing poles directly to be stabilized into the ground. 43Stabilier on the ground for poles, according to the previo us claims, characterized by the fact that version b foresees a stabilizing device into the ground with point ib, helical part 2b, base 3b and coaxial part in elevation 4b for integral fitting pole 5b by axial introduction of its pin 6b and coaxi al blocking to be obtained with pin, screw or another blocking means. 5 Stabilizer on the ground for poles, according to the previo us claims, charaterized by the fact that version c foresees another stabilizing device into the ground with point lc, hel ical part 2c and base 3c fitted with axial pin in elevation 4c for mounting coaxial part 5c, lower end of pole 6c, and block ing of both parts by means of different devices. 6 Stabilizer on the ground for poles, according to the previous claims, characterized by the fact that the poles stabilized into the ground can be properly connected with line structures like cables, rods or others, or also with surface structures such as planes or other composition elements for carrying out the previously made laying of different structures such as se parations, supports and structures in general to be laid into work without excavations and without employing underpinning li ke foundations in concrete or others. 7 Execution forms substantially as described and illustrated for the specified purposes.

## Description
Stabilizer on the ground for poles The invention refers to a ground stabilizer for poles employ ing a shoe too with helical penetration. operating with gra dual compacting of the ground. The means substantially permi ts when the ground plane of base is foreseen for this purp ose has been reached, with transversal correspondence, integral with the said part of ground penetration to gradually increase the compactness of the retention ground while the spiral penetration of the point is progressing.In this way, the laying of supports is permitted for structures of line such as noles for ducts, road stakes, uprights for plantations and other or for surface structures such as enclosures, continuous walls or other, thus obviating the present operations of digging and concrete mix casting.Essential feature of the invention iF the fact that the empl oy of the transversal small base, when its contact with the ground has been reached, allows to operate the ground compactness in progression when penetration of the helical point is going on. This because, while the point is progressing, the quantity of ground in the penetration wedge is increasing. The ground is compacting in the said space, and, with a gradual progression, is exercising a gradual pressure effect by expansion from the ideal cylindrical wall of the wedge on the surrounding ground, thus operating a total effect of the pole stabilization. For space of the penetration wedge with constant volume is to understand the one included between the helical penetration td ol and having for base the section of the penetration cavity and the upper stabilization base on the ground.End stretchers of different kinds are at present used with he lical penetration for camping these are implements that oper ate. retention with penetration wedge, through which the resis tance to slipping off is allowed by the natural ground compac tness.These tension rods, which are generally used for tent pitching, do not allow the solution of the problem of anchoring in grounds with limited consistency.The invention permits the solution of the laying of line and surface structures at ground plane by means of a device operating with penetration and gradual ground compactness, princi pally allowing the stable placing into the ground of the stru cture and operating without excavations and laying of founda tions. Performing the rotation of the tool in the inversed sen se, the total recovery of the structures is possible.Version of execution and essential employ forms are illustrat ed in the drawings of Table 1, where Fig. 1 is the perspective view of an implement according to the invention. Fig. 2 is the view of the same in longitudinarction in driven in condition into the ground to show the ground expansion in the penetratio n wedge, on the surrounding one. Fig. 3 is the schematic view of a pole equipped with a tool at its bottom according to the invention. Fig. 4 shows a pole applied axially on an similar device on stabilisation ground From Fig.5 a pole can be noted which is coaxial applied on an analogous device on stabiliz ation ground. Fig.6 shows a set of poles applied on line for plantation support.Fig.7 illustrates the employ of poles ap plied according to the invention to be successively equipped with surface elements to form enclosure generid structures.In a version, the implement of stabilization employs a rod spike 1 with penetration point 2 having a penetrating helical relief 3 at its lower end and upper ground compacting plate 4 as well as through hole 5 for the transversal imposing bar 6 apt to bring the spike in rotation for the imposing and disconnecti ng phases.Version a is foreseen using pole la with base 2a, point 3a and helical part 4a suitable for permitting poles b be direc tly stabilized in the ground. Version b foresees a tool for stabilization in the ground pith point lb, helical part 2b, base 3b and coaxial part in elevation 4b apt for integral ap plication of pole 5b by axial introduction of its pin 6b and coaxial blocking to obtain by means of pin, screw or other blocking part. Version c foresees another stabilization to ol in the ground with point lc, helical part 2c and base 3c, with axial pin in elevation 4c useful for the application of coaxial 5e, bottom end of thy pole 6c and blocking of the two parts by means of various devices. The poles stabilized in the ground can operate as support of different transversal structures such as cables, plates or other connecting elements.Practically, the execution particulars of the stabilization devices as well as of the line and surface structures that can thus be laid on the ground plane can be foreseen in different ways.The invention allows universality of employ for positioning structures of different kinds on ground plane,to be laid or disconnected by merely rotating the penetration rod in one sense or the other.
