# Speed command apparatus for aircraft.

## Abstract
Speed command apparatus for use in an aircraft performance management system of the type wherein a target Mach number command is supplied to the aircraft pitch controls to attain the target Mach and is simultane ously supplied to the aircraft throttles to capture a com puted engine pressure ratio EPR or fan speed N‚ÇÅ , the apparatus being operative during maximum thrust climbs and minimum thrust descents upon an abrupt step func tion target Mach number command. The step function command is converted to a ramp command, the slope of which is directly proportional to the existing thrust minus drag conditions of the aircraft and inversely proportional to its existing weight, thus ensuring a proper division between aircraft acceleration and rate of climb or air craft deceleration and rate of descent.
