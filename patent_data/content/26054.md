# Radar corner reflector.

## Abstract
A radar reflector suitable for use on small boats and other vessels and marine buoys. In order to provide coverage of a full 360 degrees of azimuth even when heeled the reflector consists of ten trihedral reflectors directed outwardly of a major axis the inner eight of which are formed in vertically displaced pairs of dihedral reflectors 11 13, 11 12 sub divided by a divider portion 15 which reflectors are positioned such that the apexes 3,4 of the two central dihedral reflectors are rela tively displaced about the major axis by an angle a and the apexes 2, 5 of the dihedral reflectors on each side of the central reflectors are displaced relative to the nearest apex 3, 4 of a central dihedral reflector each by an angle different to a, the arrangement being such that the spacing between the central axes of reflection of adjacent trihedral reflectors is in the range 25 degrees to 45 degrees.
