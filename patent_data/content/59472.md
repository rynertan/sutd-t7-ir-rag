# Adjustable motion brace.

## Abstract
A brace for use as a knee joint brace or a fracture brace, for example, comprises upper and lower bars and at least one pivot pin for adjoining adjacent end portions of the bars so they can pivot relative to each other about at least one transverse axis. One embodiment comprises a polycentric brace in which adjacent end portions of the upper and lower bars are engaged with one another and pivot relative to each other about a pair of spaced apart upper and lower pivot pins. A bracket protrudes outwardly beyond left and right edges of the upper bar, and a continuous arcuate groove extends through the bracket so that left and right portions of the groove extend beyond the left and right edges of the bar. Left and right stop pins are releasably inserted in the left and right portions of the groove, and the stop pins can be moved to independently desired locations in the groove and tight ened by set screws to set the angle of travel of the upper bar.
