# The method of forming a blocked cross plied polymer film.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for forming a blocked cross plied polymer film by extruding a polymer melt through a tubular rotary die to impart a molecular orientation of the polymer in the transverse TD direction during extrusion, expanding the film, and then blocking it by pressing opposing walls together to produce a film in which at least two layers thereof have transverse molecular orientations which cross to form a balanced cross plied film.
