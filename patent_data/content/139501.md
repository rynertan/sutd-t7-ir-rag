# THE MANUFACTURE AND EXPRESSION OF GENES FOR THAUMATIN

## Abstract
Disclosed are DNA sequences comprising structural genes coding for a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence and having one or more of the biochemical or immunological properties of thaumatin. Structural gene sequences may be provided with initial and terminal se quences which facilitate production of discrete protein products .eg., thaumatin I by selected host microorganisms e.g., E. coli and yeast as well as for expression by host organisms of fusion proteins e.g., L ribulokinase thaumatin I from which the desired products may be isolated.
