# Coated catalysts useful in the preparation of maleic anhydride, preparation thereof and use in the preparation of maleic anhydride.

## Abstract
Catalysts particularly effective in the oxidation of n butane, n butenes, 1,3 butadiene and mixtures thereof with molecular oxygen or an oxygen containing gas in the vapor phase to produce maleic anhydride comprise an essentially inert, at least partially porous support to which is adhered on its outer surface, catalytically active mixed oxides of vana dium and phosphorus or of vanadium, phosphorus and uranium in an amount greater than 50 to about 80 by weight of the combined support and active oxide.
