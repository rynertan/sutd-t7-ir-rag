## Description
e Lactam compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and intermediates of use in their preparation. This invention relates to novel antibiotics, to a process for their production, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to intermediates of use in their preparation. In our German OLS 2 604 697 we have described the isolation, from fermentations of Streptomvces clavuligerus, of clavulanic acid and salts thereof in pure form. The compounds in this specification are named in general with reference to clavam the name given to the parent heterocycle of formula A EMI1.1 by analogy with the term cepham used in the naming of cephalosporin compounds in J. hmer. Chem. Soc.,19f2, b4, 3400. Thus clavulanic acid is named 3R, 5R, z 2 2 hydroxyethylidene c lavam 3 carboxy 1 ic acid. The present invention relates to analogues of clavulanic acid and its salts and esters which carry an N attached triazole group in place of the hydroxy group thereof. These are of use, as detailed below, as antibiotics or as P lactamase inhibitors or they may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of further active compounds. Accordingly, we provide compounds of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R represents a carboxyl or esterified carboxyl group K1 and 2 and R , which may be the same or different, may each represent a hydrogen atom a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group or a cyano, formyl,nitro,carboxyl, esterified carboxyl, etherified thiol or a sulphone derivative thereof, acyl, etherified hydroxyl, carbamoyl, substitued carbamoyl,sulphamoyl, substituted sulphamoyl, hydrazinocarbonyl or protected hydrazinocarbonyl group together with, in the case whereR2 is a carboxyl group and or R is a carboxyl group, salts thereof. When R1 and or R2 are esterified carboxyl, acyl, etherified hydroxyl, or etherified thiol groups or sulphone derivatives of such thioether groups, they may be represented by the formulae CO2R4, COR4, OR4, SR4 and SOR4 respectively where R4 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or carbon attached heterocyclic group When R1 and or R are carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl, sulphamoyl or substituted sulphamoyl, or hydrazinocarbonyl or protected hydrazinocarbonyl groups they may be represented by the formulae CONR 5R6, SO2NR5R6 and CONHNMR7, where R5 and R6, which may be the same or different, may each represent a hydrogen atom, or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group or R and R , together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, represent a 5 7 membered heterocyclic ring which may contain a further oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atom, and R7 may represent a hydrogen atom or a protecting group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group. When any of R1 ,R2 ,R4, R5 or R6 is an alkyl group it will preferably have from 1 8 carbon atoms, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl, butyl, sec butyl or tert butyl. Such groups may if desired be substituted e.g. by a hydroxyl group or by one or more e.g. 1 3 halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine or bromine atoms. When any of R , R2 , R4 , R5 or R is an aryl group it may have up to 12 carbon atoms, and may be substituted or unsubstituted and will preferably be monocyclic e.g.phenyl. Suitable substituents include nitro, halo and alkoxy, e.g. methoxy. When any of R1,R2,R4,R5 or R6 is an aralkyl group it may have up to 20 carbon atoms, but will preferably have up to six carbon atoms in the alkyl portion and will desirably be carbocyclic and, more preferably, monocyclic e.g. benzyl. The aralkyl group may be substituted or unsubstituted. Suitable substituents include a halogen atom or a nitro or alkoxy, e.g. methoxy, group. When R4 is a carbon attached heterocyclic group it may contain 5 7 ring members and one or more e.gO up to four hetero atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur atoms0 The heterocyclic group may be saturated or unsaturated, e.g. containing up to 3 double bonds in the ring. Preferred groups R4 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, phenyl, benzyl, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, 4 nitrobenzyl and 4 methoxybenzyl groups0 5 and R6, which may be the same or different, preferably each represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, or the group NR5R6 preferably represents a morpholino or piperidino group. R7 preferably represents a hydrogen atom. It is preferred for one of R1 and R2 to be a R 2.hydrogen atom and compounds in which R2 is a hydrogen atom are more preferred. Compounds in which R2 is a hydrogen atom and R is a carbamoyl, carboxyl, acetyl, cyano, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or N methylcarbamoyl group are particularly preferred. Preferred compounds are 3R,5R,Z 2 2 4carbamoyl 1,2, 3 triazol l yl ethylidene clavam 3 carboxylic acid and salts thereof, 3R,5R,Z 2 2 4 acetyl l, 2, 3 triazol l yl ethylidene clavam 3 carboxylic acid and salts thereof, and 3R,5R,Z 2 C2 4 cyano 1,2,3 triazol l yl ethylidene clavam 3 carboxylic acid and salts thereof. The esters according to the invention may in general be represented as compounds of formula I in which R is a group COOR3 where R3 represents an organic group which is conveniently derived from an alcohol aliphatic or araliphatic , a phenol, a silanol, or a stannanol. Such an alcohol, phenol, silanol, or stannanol used to esterify the carboxyl group preferably contains not more than 24 carbon atoms. Thus, the group R3 may represent a straight or branched unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or alkenyl group, preferably having from 1 8 carbon atoms, for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl, butyl, secbutyl, tert butyl or allyl group, optional substituents being for example, alkoxy e.g. methoxy halogen i.e.fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine cyano acyloxy, e.g. alkanoyloxy, such as acetoxy or pivaloyloxy or alkoxycarbonyloxy e.g. ethoxycarbonyloxy acyl e.g. pbromobenzoyl and alkoxycarbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl an aralkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms especially an arylmethyl group e.g. a benzyl or substituted benzyl group, suitable substituents being either halo e.g. chloro nitro, e.g. o or nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.g. methyl groups a diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl group or a fur 2 ylmethyl, thien 2 ylmethyl or pyrid 4 ylmethyl group, the heterocyclic groups of which may also be substituted e.g. by a C14 alkyl group, preferably methyl an aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms e.g. a phenyl or substituted phenyl group, suitable substituents being eithe halo e.g. chloro nitro, e.g. Q or 1J nitro cyano alkoxy e.g. methoxy or alkyl e.a F methyl groups a cycloalkyl group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms e.g. adamantyl, cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl a heterocyclic group containing not more than 12 carbon atoms, the hetero atom being, for example, oxygen as in the tetrahydropyranyl or phthalidyl group, a stannyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms for example a stannyl group carrying three substituents which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy or aralkoxy groups.Such groups will include methyl, ethyl, propyl, fl butyl, phenyl and benzyl groups or a silyl group having up to 24 carbon atoms which may carry three groups which may be the same or different selected from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups. Such groups will preferably be C1 4 alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl or t butyl groups. The salts of the invention may be salts formed with inorganic bases such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium, potassium and lithium salts alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium and magnesium salts and ammonium salts or salts with organic bases, for example amine salts. In general, the acids, salts and metabolically labile esters of the compoundsof the invention are pre ferred forms for use in medicine. However, the other esters are also useful and, for example, where the ester group is readily cleaved e.g. by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis, without significant degradation of the rest of the molecule, the esters are especially useful as carboxyl protected derivatives of the parent acids.Those esters which are readily cleaved and are primarily of use in this connection include arylmethyl esters, especially the benzyl, e nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl and trityl esters as well as the stannyl, e.g. tri n butylstannyl, and silyl, e.g.trimethylsilyl, esters. As indicated above, the ester grouping may be metabolically labile,i.e. it may be converted into the carboxylic acid during metabolic processes, e.g. in the blood or liver.Metabolically labile esters include substituted alkyl esters carrying an oxygen substituent on the carbon atom, for example, the acyloxymethyl esters, e.g.acetoxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters, and the a alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters such as l ethoxycarbonyloxyethylestcrs, and phthalidyl esters. The compounds of formula I and their salts for which we have demonstrated antibacterial activity have been active against a range of gram negative and grampositive microorganisms, for example against strains ofStaphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, Enterobacter cloacaeKlebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Serratia marcescens, Providencia species,Citrobacter koseri and Haemophilus influenzae. In general, the compounds of formula I and their salts are stable to the action of p lactamases produced by gram positive organisms, for example those produced byStaphylococcus aureus, and to the p lactamases produced by gram negative organisms. Compounds of the invention also possess the ability to inhibit ss lactamase enzymes produced by gram positive organisms, for example those produced by strains ofStaphylococcus aureus and also the enzymes from gramnegative bacteria produced by organisms such as strains of Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli Proteus morganii, Klebsiella aerozAnes, Salmonella typhimurium. Shigella sonnei, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Citrobacter freundii. Compounds of the invention have the ability to protect ss lactamase susceptible p lactam antibiotics from p lactamase hydrolysis. Certain compounds of the invention, including compounds of formula I in which R represents a carboxyl group in salt form, R2 is a hydrogen atom andR1 is an acetyl, cyano, or carbamoyl group, are also absorbed when administered orally as shown by studies in mice. The new antibiotic acids and their physiologically acceptable salts and metabolically labile esters are of interest for use in conjunction with M lactam antibiotics which show susceptibility to ss lactamases from both grampositive and gram negative organisms. In general, active compounds of the invention may be used in combination with broad spectrum lactam antibiotics which are normally administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Use of the new antibiotic acids and their salts is preferred. Examples of orally absorbed broad spectrum p lactam antibiotics include cephalexin, cephaloglycin, ampicillin and amoxycillin and their orally absorbed esters, e.g. the acyloxymethyl and phthalidyl esters, and the orally absorbed esters of carbenicillin, ticarcillin and mecillinam e.g. the indanyl, phenyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters. Broad spectrum p lactam antibiotics which are not orally absorbed include carbenicillin, ticarcillin, mecillinam, cephalothin, cephaloridine, cefazolin, cephacetrile and cephapirin.Examples of narrow spectrum p lactam antibiotics are penicillin G and penicillin V. The above antibiotics may also be in the form of their metabolically labile esters, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and or solvents thereof. Combinations of the active compounds of the invention with for example ampicillin and amoxycillin show synergistic activity against p lactamase producing organisms including strains of for example Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnet Proteus organic andProteus vulgaris. According to a further feature of the invention, we provide pharmaceutical compositions including veterinary compositions containing at least one of the acids, physiologically acceptable salts or metabolically labile esters according to the invention. In view of the protective action described above the compositions can advantageously contain one or more,and more generally one,further p lactam antibiotic. The compositions will normally also contain a pharmaceutical including veterinary carrier or excipient. The compositions of the invention include those in a form adapted for oral or parenteral use.The compositions may, for example, take the form of powders, tablets, capsules, lozenges, solutions and syrups suitable for oral administration, and may include, for example, starch, lactose, talc, magnesium stearate, gelatin, distilled water and suspending, dispersing, emulsifying, flavouring or colouring agents. The compounds may further be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration. The compounds may thus be formulated in ampoules for reconstitution before use. In general, the weight ratio of the compound of the invention to a p lactam antibiotic to be protected will be in the range 10 1 to 1 10, more preferably 5 1 to 1 5 especially 2 1 to 1 2. The active compounds of the invention will generally be administered at a total daily dosage level of 50 mg to 20 g, preferably from 100 mg to 10 g, which may be in divided doses given from 1 4 times per day. Where the composition contains a further 3 lactam antibiotic, the total quantity of p lactam antibiotic will desirably be from 100 mg to 20 g, which may be given in divided doses from 1 4 times a day. In general, the total daily dosage of f lactam antibiotic when the active compound is used alone or in combination with a further p lactam antibiotic will advantageously be from 250 mg to 5 g.Dosage units will in general contain 12. 5 mg to 5 g, preferably 50 mg to 1 g of active compound according to the invention when used alone and 25 mg to 5 g, preferably 100 mg to 1 of total p lactam antibiotic where a further antibiotic is present. Active compounds of the invention may be of use, either alone or in combination with a further lactam antibiotic in treating a variety of diseases in humans and animals, caused by pathogenic bacteria, such as respiratory tract or urinary tract infections. According to a further aspect of the invention, we provide a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein a compound of formula II EMI11.1 wherein R is as defined above is reacted with an acetylene R1 C N C R2 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above followed, where the inital product is an ester and an acid or salt is desired, by deesterification, and by subsequent salt formation. In this reaction R is preferably an esterified carboxyl group. Reaction will generally be conducted in an inert organic solvent. Suitable solvents include ethers e.g.tetrahydrofuran, hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane, amides e.g. dimethylformamide, or esters e.g. ethyl acetate. A temperature of from 100 to 500 will normally be employed though higher temperatures may be needed with the less reactive acetylenes. When an unsymmetrical acetylene reagent is used, ie.when R1 and R2 are different a mixture of isomers may be obtained, although in general one Isomer will predominate. It should be understood that this invention extends to the individual isomers as well as mixtures containing them. Azido compounds of formula II whence the compounds of the invention amy be prepared can be obtained as described in Belgian Patent No. 855,375. In the above reactions, where the compound of the invention formed is an ester and the corrsponding acid or salt is required, the compound may be subjected to deesterification. For this purpose readily cleavable esters, for example, arylmethyl esters which may be cleaved by reduction, e.g. by hydrogenolysis, are pre ferred. Cleavage of an arylmethyl ester, e.g. a nitrobenzyl ester, may be effected by hydrogenolysis for example using a metal catalyst, e.g. a noble metal such as platinum, palladium or rhodium. The catalyst may be supported e,g. on charcoal or kieselguhr. A p nitrobenzyl group may also be removed by reduction of the nitro group e.g. using a dissolving metal reducing agent such as zinc in acetic acid, or zinc in aqueous tetrahydrofuran or acetone controlled, for example, in the pH range 3 6, preferaby 4.0 5.5 by the addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid aluminium amalgam in a moist ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or iron and ammonium chloride in an aqueous ether e.g. aqueous tetrahydrofuran followed by hydrolysis either under reduction conditions or by subsequent treatment with acid. Alternatively, a p nitrobenzyl ester may be cleaved under alkaline conditions using, for example, sodium sulphide in a solvent such as aqueous tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetone. A stannyl or silyl ester can be cleaved by very mild solvolysis, e.g. by reaction with water, alcohols, phenols or carboxylic acids, e.g.acetic acid. The esters of formula I may be prepared from acids of formula I or a reactive derivative thereof by reaction with an alcohol, phenol, silanol or stannanol or a reactive derivative thereof to form the desired ester.Reaction will desirably be effected under mild conditions in order to prevent rupture of the bicyclic nucleus.The use of neutral or mild acidic or basic conditions, therefore, at temperatures between 70 and 350C is preferred. The alkyl, alkoxyalkyl and aralkyl esters may be prepared by reaction of the acid of formula I with the appropriate diazoalkane or diazoaralkane e.g. diazomethane or diphenyldiazomethane. The reaction will generally be effected in an ether, ester or a halohydrocarbon solvent, e.g. diethyl ether, ethyl acetate or dichloromethane. In general, reduced temperatures are preferred, for example 150 to 150 C. The esters derived from alcohols may be produced by reaction of a reactive derivative of the alcohol, for example, a halide such as the chloride, bromide or iodide, or a hydrocarbonsulphonyl derivative such as a methanesulphonyl or p toluenesulphonyl ester, with a salt of the acid of formula I eg. an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt such as a lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium or barium salt or an amine salt, such as a triethylammonium salt. This reaction is preferably carried out in a substituted sulphoxide or amide solvent e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide. Stannyl esters may conveniently be formed by reaction of the carboxylic acid of formula I or a salt thereof with reactive tetravalent tin moieties. Trialkyl tin oxides are preferred for the synthesis of tin compounds in view of their availability and low toxicity. Silyl esters of the acid of formula I may be formed by reaction with a reactive tetravalent silicon moiety.Trialkylsilyl halides and mono or bis silylated acetamides are preferred as silylating agents. Proton acceptors e.g. weak bases such as pyridine may often be used with advantage when hydrogen halides are formed during such esterification. In the formation of salts of the invention, an acid initially formed in solution in an appropriate organic solvent, may be reacted with an appropriate base, preferably under conditions favouring precipitation of the salt. In the formation of alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts, an alkanoate is a preferred base, e.g. a 2 ethylhexanoate. The invention will now be more particularly described in the following Preparations and Examples which should not be construed as limiting the invention.Throughout the Examples all temperatures are in OC, The spectral data obtained on compounds described in the Examples which follow was consistent with the structures assigned. Where n.m.r. data is presented, selected values only are given.

Biological testing of a number of compounds of the invention has provided the results shown in the following tables the test compounds are identified by theirExample Numbers RESULTS OF BIOLOGICAL TESTS OF CLAVULANIC ACID DERIVATIVES 1. Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations MIC Table 1 Serial two fold dilutions of freshly prepared test solution were made into Oxoid No. 1 Nutrient agar with or without added enrichment and poured into petri dishes.Plates were innoculated with a multipoint innoculator with innoculum containing approximately 10 colony forming units of the organisms shown in Table 1 all of which are clinical isolates. The MIC in tlg ml was read after 18 hours incubation at 370C as the lowest concentration which inhibited growth.2. Synergy testinz Table 3 Method as for 1, incorporating amoxycillin in serial two fold dilutions along with a sub inhibitory, fixed concentration of the test clavulanic acid derivative, as shown in the Table. All of the organisms are clinical isolates. 3. ss Lactamase Inhibition Table 2 The compounds have been tested for their inhibitory activity against partially purified ss lactamases fromEscherichia coli either TEM or RPI , Klebsiella aerogenes K1 and Staphylococcus auretis PCI . The substrate used was ampicillin sodium. The results are shown in Table 2. Ampicillin sodium at a concentration of 500 llg ml was reacted with the enzyme at 37 C and pH7. The enzyme concentration was such as to destroy all the ampicillin within 10 minutes. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically by observing the loss of absorption at 238 nm. Concentrations of the compound were added to inhibit the reaction, and the I50 value represents g ml of compound halving the initial velocity of hydrolysis of ampicillin.4. Toxicity The compounds have generally been found to be of low toxicity. Thus, for example, the compounds of Examples 4 6, 14, 17 and 19 when administered intraperitoneally to mice gave LD5p values of greater than 500 mg kg.
