## Description
Novel substituted nitrodiphenyl ethers, herbicidal compositions containing them and the use thereof for combating weedsThis invention concerns the provision of new nitrodiphenyl ethers, herbicidal compositions containing them and methods of combating weeds.Diphenyl ethers are known to be effective weed control agents. See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 3,928,416 3,454,392 3,798,276 3,873,303 4,001,005 and 4,029,493 among the many patents issued. However, herbicidal effectiveness of a diphenyl ether cannot be predicted from its structure only. Often quite closely related compounds will have quite different weed control abilities. See, Advances in Agronomy, Vol. 24, pages 331, 332, 355, 356, 357 and 358,Herbicides, Chemical Degradation and Mode of Action, Kearney and Kaufman, Vol. 2, Dekker, Inc. pages 552 563 and 728 737 and Mode of Action of Herbicides, Ashton and Crafts and alsoU.S. Patent Nos. 3,454,392 and 3,776,961.An ideal herbicide should give selective weed control, over the full growing season, with a single administration at low rates of application. It should be able to control all common weeds by killing them as the seed, the germinating seed, the seedling, and the growing plant. At the same time, the herbicide should be substantially nonphytotoxic to the crops to which it is applied and should decompose or other wise be dissipated so as not to poison the soil permanently.The known diphenyl ether herbicides fall short of these ideals and thus the search has continued to discover new herbicides which are more selective or which complement the activities of known diphenyl ethers or other herbicides.The new nitrodiphenyl ethers provided by the invention provide a useful choice in comparison with known nitrodiphenyl ether herbicides.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a new class of diphenyl ether herbicides of the following structural formula EMI2.1 wherein X is hydrogen, halo, trihalomethyl particularly trifluoromethyl , alkyl for example, C1 ClO alkyl and particularly C1 C4 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl and tert butyl , nitro or cyano XÚ is hydrogen, halo or trihalomethyl particularly trifluoromethyl R and R2 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, Cl C4 alkyl, phenyl and benzyl, the CR1R2 groups being the same or different when n is 1 n is an integer of from 1 to 5 and Z is halo, trihalomethyl particularly trifluoromethyl , nitro, cyano, methylthio, methylsulfinyl, methylsulfonyl, acetyl, phenyl or a heterocyclic group having from 4 to 6 nuclear atoms containing from 1 to 3 or 4 of the same or different nuclear hetero atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Examples of heterocyclic groups are pyridyl, furyl, piperidyl, morpholinyl, thienyl thiazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, tetrahydrofuryl and tetrahydrothienyl. In preferred compounds X is halo particularly chloro and X1 is hydrogen or halo particularly chioro .The term halo used throughout this specification means chloro, bromo, fluoro or iodo preferred halo substituents are chloro or fluoro.A sub class of compounds are those of Formula I, wherein X when alkyl is Cl C4 alkyl, Z is other than methylsulfinyl and when Z is a heterocyclic group such group contains 1 3 nuclear heteroatoms, eg groups such as pyridyl, furyl, piperidyl, morpholinyl or thienyl.Examples of compounds embraced by Formula I include 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 w chloro n propoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2,6 dichloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 trifluoroethOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 fluoro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 a methyl a nitro n butoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 4 trifluoromethyl 3 ss methyl ss cyano n butoxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 nitro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 ss phenethoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 cyano 4 trifluoromethyl 3 ss methylthioethOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 methyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 e methylsulphonyl n pentoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2,4 bis trifluoromethyl 3 C acetyl n butoxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 furfuryloxycarbonyl 41 nitrodiphenyl ether 4 trifluoromethyl 3 4 pyridyl methoxycarbonyl 4 nitro diphenyl ether 2,6 difluoro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 3 pyrrollyl ethOxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 3 2 pyrazinlyl propOxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 thienyl methOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 3 thienyl methOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 thiazolyl methOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 4 thiazolyl methOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 5 thiazolyl methOxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 2 oxazolyl methoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 4 oxazolyl methoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 5 oxazolyl methoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 1,3,4 oxadiazolyl methOxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 5 1,2,3,4 tetrazolyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 3 pyridazinyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 4 pyridazinyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 2 pyrimidinyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 4 pyrimidinyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 5 pyrimidinyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 pyrazinyl methoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 2 tetrahydrofurfuryl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 3 tetrahydrofurfuryl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 2 tetrahydrothienyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 f 3 tetrahydrothienyl methoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 acetyl ethoxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether and 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 3 2 oxo tetrahydrofurfuryl oxycarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 trichloromethyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chloroethoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 tribromomethyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chloroethoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 n butyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chloroethoxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 n decyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chloroethoxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 6 trifluoromethyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chloroethoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 6 trichloromethyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chioroethoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 6 tribronomethyl 4 trifluoromethyl 3 V 2 chloroethoxycarbonyl 4 nitrrdiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 cyanohexyloxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2ch1oro Atrifluoromethy1 3 2 nitro 2 phenylethoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 l benzyl 2 chloroethoxy carbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl ether.The diphenyl ethers of this invention may be prepared by any suitable method described in the literature for the preparation of compounds having an analogous structure or by other methods devised for the purpose. A first method involves reacting an appropriate acid halide with an appropriate hydroxy substituted compound. A second method involves reacting an appropriate alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carboxylate with an appropriate halo substituted compound.In the first method a 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 halocarbonyl4 nitrophenyl ether is reacted with an hydroxy compound in the presence of an inert solvent such as toluene. This reaction may be conducted at a temperature in the range of from about 20 to about 150 C. Reaction times may vary from about 15 minutes to about 16 hours. The reaction is usually conducted at a temperature between 50 to 1000C for a period of time of about 1 2 to about 2 hours. The following reaction scheme applies to this method EMI6.1 wherein X, X1, R1, Rz, n and Z are as defined above.In the second method a 4 trifluoromethylphenyl 3 alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxycarbonyl 4 nitrophenyl ether is reacted with an appropriate halo substituted compound in the presence of an inert solvent eg dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or methyl ethyl ketone at atemperature in the range of from about 20 to about 1500C.The reaction period may be in the range of from about 1 4 to about 16 hours. The following reaction scheme illustrates this method EMI7.1 wherein X, X1, R1, R2, n and Z are as defined above and M is a cation derived from an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.The diphenyl ethers of Formula I are useful as preemergence and postemergence herbicides. Preemergence herbicides are ordinarily used to treat the soil by application either before seeding, during seeding, after seeding and before the crop emerges. Postemergence herbicides are those which are applied after the plants have emerged and during their growth period. The compounds of Formula I are especially active as postemergence herbicides. Thus the invention provides a method of combating weeds, usually in an agronomic crop area, which comprises applying to the growing weeds, eg weed seedlings, or to a growth medium prior to emergence of the weeds, one or more of the diphenyl ethers in an amount sufficient to combat the growth of the weeds. Among the crops on which the diphenyl ethers of Formula I can be advantageously employed are cotton, soybeans, peanuts, beans, peas, carrots, maize, wheat and other cereal crops.The diphenyl ethers of Formula I are useful for controlling weeds in rice crops. When used in transplanted rice crops, the ethers can be applied either preemergence or postemergence to the weeds that is, they can be applied to the transplanted rice plants and their growth medium either before the weed plants have emerged or while they are in their early stages of growth. The ethers can be applied tÏ the growth medium either before or after the rice has been transplanted to that medium.The diphenyl ethers can be applied in any amount which will give the required control of weeds. A standard rate of application of the herbicides of the invention is in the range from 0.1 to 13.5 kg of diphenyl ether per hectare. A preferred range is from 0.1 to 2.24 kg ha.Under some conditions, the diphenyl ethers may be advantageously incorporated into the soil or other growth medium prior to planting a crop. This incorporation can be by any convenient means, including simple mixing with the soil, applying the diphenyl ether to the surface of the soil and then discing or dragging into the soil to the desired depth, or by employing a liquid carrier.The diphenyl ethers of the invention can be applied to the growth medium or to plants to be treated either neat or as a component in a herbicidal composition or formulation which also comprises an agronomically acceptable carrier. Agronomically acceptable carrier is any carrier which can be used to dissolve, disperse or diffuse a herbicidal compound in the composition without impairing the effectiveness of the herbicidal compound and which by itself has no permanent detrimental effect on the soil, equipment, crops, or agronomic environment. Mixtures of the diphenyl ethers of the invention may also be used in any of these herbicidal formulations.Herbicidal formulations may be in the form of a a dust or granules or b a formulation which contains a surfactant and which is a wettable powder, concentrated liquid sus pension, solution, water dispersible paste, emulsifiable concentrate or flowable emulsion concentrate. In general the diphenyl ethers may be formulated and used as described in Australian Published Patent Application No. 506,509 and they may be used in conjunction with other pesticides as described in said Australian Application.The following examples are given by way of illustration.Percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise noted.Example 1 2 Chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 2 chloroethoxyCarbonyl 4 nitrodiphenyl etherTo a 1 necked flask equipped with a stirrer was added 2chloro 4 trifluoromethyl 3 chlorocarbonyl 4 nitrophenyl ether 19.D g 0.05 moles , 2 chloroethanol 40 g 0.5 moles ana toluene 100 ml .
