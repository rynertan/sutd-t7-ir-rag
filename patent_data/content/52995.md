# X ray apparatus.

## Abstract
An X ray stereoscopic cinematography apparatus util ises an X ray tube having at least a pair of focal spots from which X rays are radiated independently at an object under study to produce X ray images of the object. An image intensifier 3 converts the X ray image to an optical image, which is applied to an optical system 4 . The optical system 4 includes a first half mirror 4b having a reflection factor of approximately fifty percent and being positionable in a first position 5 to reflect the optical image to a first cinecamera 6 and to transmit the image to a second cinecamera 5 and in a second inoperative position R a second half mirror 4e which, when the first half mirror 4b is in the second position, is positioned in the light path to deflect the image to the first cinecamera 6 , and has a comparatively low transmission rate a fully reflective mirror 4d which reflects light transmitted through the second half mirror 4e back to the second half mirror and a small eflector 41 positioned in the light path in front of the first and second half mirrors 4b, 4e to distribute a part of the incident light to a television camera. Mode setting equip ment selects a stereoscopic cinematography mode, or a single cinematography mode, or a fluoroscopy mode.
