# Electroconductive powder and process for production thereof.

## Abstract
By pouring a solution containing hydrolyzable tin and antimony salts into an aqueous dispersion of titanium oxide particles and mixing, the salts are caused to hydrolyze, whereby a uniform and strongly adhering coating layer of antimonyoxide containing thin oxide is formed on the sur face of each particle of the titanium oxide. The coated powder thus obtained is non hygroscopic and non toxic and exhibits stable electroconductivity. Furthermore, since it can possess excellent whiteness, it is suitable for form ing the electroconductive layers of electro thermosensitive papers and electrostatic recording papers, for use as the antistatic agent of resins, and for other uses.
