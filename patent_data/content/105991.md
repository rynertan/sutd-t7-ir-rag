## Description
Silver halide photosensitive materials for color photographyThis invention relates to a silver halide photosensitive material for color photography containing a novel cyan dye image forming coupler.A color image is usually formed by oxidative coupling of the oxidized product, which is formed by reduction of the exposed silver halide grains with an aromatic primary amine type color developing agent, with a coupler capable of forming yellow magenta cyan dye in a silver halide emulsion.As the coupler which may be typically employed for forming the cyan dye, there may be mentioned phenols and naphthols. In particular, the basic properties required for the phenols in the light of photographic performance of the coupler are that the dye has good spectral absorption characteristics, i.e., spectrum has no absorption in green region, but sharp absorption, that the formed dye shows sufficient fastness to light, heat, moisture and the like as well as good colorability, i.e., the dye shows sufficient color sensitivity and density and further that there is no loss of the dye even if a breaching bath or breach fix bath containing EDTA iron III complex as a main ingredient is exhausted owing to running. Moreover, it has been encountered a serious problem in view of environmental pollution to remove the benzyl alcohol having incorporated into a color developing agent. However, the present situation is that a satisfactory color development can not be generally accomplished unless benzyl alcohol is added. Particularly remarkable reduction in color development can be seen with a phenol cyan coupler when benzyl alcohol is to be removed. From this point of view, there is a demand for a phenol cyan coupler with a higher color development even if benzyl alcohol is not present.In order to meet the aforesaid requirments, there have been hitherto made various studies, but there has not yet found such a coupler capable of perfectly meeting all the foregoing properties as far as the present inventors know. For instance, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,801,171, 6 a 2,4 di tert amylphenoxy butaneamidoj 2, 4 di chloro 3 methylphenol shows a good fastness to light, but has a poor heat fastness, a great loss of the dye in the exhausted breach fix bath as well as a large color reliance to benzyl alcohol and a difficult removal of benzyl alcohol from a color developing agent. U.S.PatentNo. 2,895,826 discloses 2 heptafluorobutaneamido 5 a 2,4 di tert amylphenoxy hexaneamido1phenol, which shows excellent heat fastness and loss of dye in the exhausted breach fix bath, but has inferior light fastness and color development. Also, the coupler as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid open ApplicationNo. 53 10963 encounters problems about removal of benzyl alcohol and also light fastness. Further, those phenol type cyan couplers as disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,839,044, Japanese Patent Laid openApplication No. 47 37425, Japanese Patent Publication No. 48 36894, Japanese Patent Laid open ApplicationsNo. 50 10135, No. 50 117422, No. 50 130441, No.50 108841, No. 50 120334 and the like are regarded as unsatisfactory with regard to heat fastness and removal of benzyl alcohol. The phenol couplers having a ureido group at the 2 position thereof as disclosed in British Patent No. 1,011,940 and U.S.Patents No. 3,446,622, No. 3,996,253, No. 3,758,308,No. 3,880,661 and the like tend to form cyan dyes which shows broad spectral absorption and further considerable absorption within a green region of spectrum due to the maximum absorption in a red region or a relatively short wave range, which seems to be unfavourable in color reproduction. Other phenol couplers having a ureido group at the 2position thereof as disclosed in Japanese PatentLaid open Application No. 56 65134 show a considerably improved green absorption in spectral region, but still show unsatisfactory other properties.The present inventors have made earnest studies to improve prior art noted above and, as a result, found out that the coupler as defined below can perfectly meet the above recited characteristics required as a phenol cyan coupler.More specifically, the silver halide photosensitive material for color photography according to the present invention is characterized by comprising a phenol type cyan coupler having the formula I EMI4.1 whereinX1 is CN, COOR1, COR1, SO2OR1, SO2R1,EMI4.2 NO2 or CF3 in which R is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an aryl group and R1 is an alkyl group or an aryl group X2 is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxy group, a nitro group or a monovalent organic group Y may optionally be non metallic atom groups capable of forming a 5 or 6 membered condensed ring Z is a hydrogen atom or a removable group upon coupling reaction of a color developing agent with an oxidized product Ball is a Ballast group and n is an integer of 0 to 4 inclusive provided that 2 when n is 2 or more, X s may be the same or different.As the alkyl group in the definition of R and R1 of the group X, there may be usually mentioned a C1 to C10 straight or branched alkyl group, preferably C1 to C4 straight or branched alkyl group. As the aryl group, there may be mentioned, for example, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or naphthyl group.In the above formula, the monovalent organic group represented by X2 may include, for example, an alkyl group, an acyloxy group, an alkoxy group, an acyl group and the like. As the alkyl group, there may be preferably mentioned a C1 to C5 straight or branched alkyl group and illustrative examples thereof may include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert pentyl, chloromethyl, acetonyl, phenethyl, etc.As the acyloxy group, there may be mentioned a C1 toC5 aliphatic acyloxy group and an aromatic acyloxy group and illustrative examples thereof may include acetoxy, propionyloxy, pivaloyloxy, benzoyloxy, naphthoyloxy, etc.As the alkoxy group, there may be preferably mentioned a C1 to C5 aliphatic alkoxy group and an aromatic alkoxy group and illustrative examples thereof may include methoxy, tert butoxy, ethoxymethoxy, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl.As the acyl group, there may be preferably mentioned a C1 to C5 aliphatic acyl group and an aromatic acyl group and illustrative examples thereof may include acetyl, pivaloyl, acetoacetyl, benzoyl, naphthoyl, toluyl, etc.Also, the phenyl group of the phenylureido portion in the present coupler may have a condensed ring formed together with the group Y. Where the said phenyl group has the condensed ring, the substituent x2 may be located on the phenyl moiety or the said condensed ring moiety. The condensed ring formed together with the group Y may include, for example, naphthalene, quinoline, benzothiophene, benzofuran, isocoumaran and the like.As illustrative examples of the group Z which may be removed in a coupling reaction, there may be mentioned, for example, a halogen atom, e.g., chlorine, bromine or fluorine atom an aryloxy group, a carbamoyloxy group, a carbamoylmethoxy group, an acyloxy group, a sulfonamido group, a succinimido group, oxygen or nitrogen atom being attached directly to the coupling site in the said groups.Further examples thereof may include those as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,471,563, Japanese PatentLaid open Application No. 47 37425, Japanese PatentPublication No. 48 36894, Japanese Patent Laid openApplications No. 50 10135, No. 50 117422, No. 50130441, No. 51 108841, No. 50 120334, No. 52 18315,No. 53 52423, No. 53 105226 and the like. The ballasted acylamino group Ball substituted at the 5 position in the phenyl moiety may act as the ballast which can maintain a coupler in a specific layer so as to substantially prevent the said coupler from dispersion to any other layer in a multi layer color photographic element and should, therefore, require a sufficient bulkiness for such purposes.Illustrative examples thereof may include an aromatic acylamino group and an aliphatic acylamino group.In the case of the aromatic acylamino group, the aromatic ring should have substituent s having a C5 to C18 alkyl chain. As the substituent having a C5 to C18 alkyl chain, there may be mentioned, for example, an alkyl group, an acyloxy group, an acylamino group, a sulfonylamino group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, a carbamoyl group, a sulfamoyl group, an alkylamino group, a dialkylamino group and the like.In the case of the aliphatic acylamino group, there may be typically mentioned those wherein the aliphatic moiety is a C5 to C18 long chain alkyl group, a phenoxyalkyl group or a phenylthioalkyl group. In the case of the phenoxyalkyl or phenylthioalkyl group, the phenoxy moiety may have a substituent having a C5 to C18 alkyl chain or the alkyl moiety may have 5 to 18 carbon atoms. As the ballasted acylamino group in the present coupler, the Ball is particularly a phenoxyalkyl group or a phenylthioalkyl group for favourable results. Illustrative examples of the acylamino group ballasted with a phenoxyalkyl group are recited below. a 3 Pentadecylphenoxy butaneamido, alpha 2,4 di tert amylphenoxy hexanemido, y 2, 4 di tert amylphenoxy butaneamido, a 2,4 di tert amylphenoxy tetradecaneamido, alpha 4 butylsulfonylaminophenoxy tetradecaneamido, a 4 acetoxyphenoxy dodecaneamido, a p Ea 4 hydroxyphenyl a,a dimethyl tolyloxy dodecaneamido, a 4 carboxyphenoxyl dodecaneamido, a 2 chloro 4 butylsulfonylaminophenoxy tetra decaneamido, alpha 4 dimethylaminosulfonylaminophenoxy tetra decaneamido, a 3 dodecyloxyphenoxy butaneamido, a 4 dodecyloxyphenoxy butaneamido, a 4 hydroxyphenylthio dodecaneamido, and alpha 4 acetylaminophenylthio dodecaneamido.

Typically the coupler can be blended with a silver halide emulsion and the emulsion is coated onto a base to form a photographic element.The photographic element may be monochromatic or multicolor one. In the case of a multicolor photographic element, the present cyan dye forming coupler may be usually incorporated into a red sensitive emulsion, but contain a non sensitized emulsion or dye image forming constituent units having photosensitivity to respective three primary colors in spectrum. Each constituent unit may comprise a monoemulsion layer or a multi emulsion layer which has a photosensitivity to a certain region in spectrum. Element layers including the image forming constituent unit layer may be arranged in any optional order as is well known to those skilled in the art.Typical multi color photographic element comprises a cyan dye forming image forming constituent unit, said unit comprising at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one cyan dye forming coupler at least one of the coupler is the present coupler and a yellow dye image forming constituent unit, said unit comprising at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one magenta dye forming coupler, both units being carried on a base. The element may further contain additional layers, for example, a filter layer, an interlayer, a protective layer, a subbing layer and the like.The present coupler may be incorporated into an emulsion according to any well known techniques.For instance, the present coupler alone or in combination with other ingredients may be dissolved in a high boiling organic solvent with a boiling point of 1750 C. or higher such as tricresyl phosphate, dibutyl phthalate and the like or a low boiling organic solvent such as butyl acetate, butyl propionate and the like alone or, if necessary, in combination therewith, the resulting solution is admixed with an aqueous solution of gelatin containing a surface active agent, the resulting mixture is then emulsified by a high speed rotary mixer or a colloid mixer and incorporated into a silver halide to prepare a silver halide emulsion which may be employed in this invention. And, where the present coupler is to be incorporated into the present silver halide emulsion, the coupler is employed in a range of usually about 0.07 0.7 mole, preferably 0.1 0.4 mole, per mole of the silver halide.As the silver halide which may be employed in the present silver halide emulsion, there may be included any optional silver halides commonly employed for a silver halide emulsion such as silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodobromide and the like.A silver halide emulsion which constitutes the present silver halide emulsion may be prepared by any various conventional methods such as the method disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 467772 Namely, a method for preparing the so called conversion emulsion wherein a silver salt grain emulsion is formed, the said grain comprising at least partly a silver salt having a higher solubility than that of silver bromide, and then at least part of the said silver salt is converted to silver bromide or silver iodobromide or a method for preparing the so called Lippmann emulsion comprising silver halide fine grains having an average grain size of not more than 0.1 p. Moreover, the present silver halide emulsion may be chemically sensitized with a sulfur sensitizer such as allylthiocarbamide, thiourea, cystine and the like, an active or inactive selenium sensitizer, a reduction sensitizer such as a stannous salt, a polyamine and the like, a noble metal sensitizer such as a gold sensitizer, typically potassium aurithiocyanate, potassium chloroaurate, 2 aurosulfobenzothiazole methyl chloride and the like, or a water soluble rutenium, rhodium, iridium or like salt sensitizer, typically ammonium chloropalladate, potassium chloroplatinate, sodium chloropalladate and the like alone or in any combination therewith.The present silver halide emulsion may also contain a wide variety of well known photographic additives, for example, those disclosed in Research Disclosure , 1978, December, item 17643.The present silver halide emulsion may have spectral sensitization upon selection of any suitable sensitizing dyes in order to afford a photosensitivity to the sensitive wave length region required for a red sensitive emulsion. As the spectrally sensitizing dye, there may be employed one or more of various dyes and, for this invention, there may be mentioned, for example, those cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes or complex cyanine dyes as disclosed in U.S. PatentsNo. 2,269,234, No. 2,270,378, No. 2,442,710, No.2,454,629, No. 2,776,280.The color developing solution which may be employed in this invention may preferably contain as a main ingredient an aromatic primary amine type color developing agent. Illustrative examples of such color developing agent may be typically of a p phenylenediamine type for example, diethyl pphenylenediamine hydrochloride, monomethyl pphenylenediamine hydrochloride, dimethyl pphenylenediamine hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 diethylaminotoluene hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N dodecylamino toluene, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N ss methanesulfonamidoethyl aminotoluene sulfate, 4 N ethyl N ss methanesulfonamidoethylamino aniline, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N ss methoxyethyl aminotoluene, 4 N ethyl N ss hydroxyethylamino aniline and the like.After development, conventional steps of bleaching for removal of silver or a silver halide, fixing or bleach fixing, washing and drying may be applied.
