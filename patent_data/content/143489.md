# Supervisory arrangement for a digital transmission system.

## Abstract
Method of controlling a supervisory arrangement of a digital transmission system in which a plurality of repeaters are arranged between two terminal stations, a terminal station trans mitting a call message which is provided with an address number towards the desired repeater. In each repeater passed through the received address number is increased by a fixed number, for example 1, and thereafter compared with another fixed number, for example O. The repeater which detects that the increased address number received is equal to the other fixed number transmits its service information towards at least one terminal station. This accomplishes that all said repeaters may be of an identical construction.
