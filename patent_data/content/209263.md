# Vehicle power transmissions.

## Abstract
A transmission for a vehicle which is frequently reversed comprises a torque convertor 12 to be driven by an internal combustion engine, and planetary change speed gearing 1, 2, 3, 4 having an input 10 driven by the output of the torque convertor and an output 14 connected to the driving wheels 15 of the vehicle. The individual speed ratios in both the for ward and the reverse directions of drive are each selectively engaged by the engagement of associated friction elements BR to provide a plurality of speed ratios in the forward direc tion and at least one speed ratio in the reverse direction. In response to movement of the control element from a first posi tion corresponding to the prevailing direction of drive to a sec ond position corresponding to the opposite direction of drive, the following operations are caused to occur in sequence release of the friction element BR3 determining the ratio engaged in the prevailing direction of drive, engagement of the friction element K1, K2 associated with a high speed ratio in the opposite direction of drive and initiation of engagement of the friction element BR2 associated with a lower speed ratio in the said opposite direction of drive, followed by release of the friction element K2 associated with the said high ratio in the said opposite direction after a period of retardation of the vehicle but preferably before its speed has been reduced to zero in the said prevailing direction.
