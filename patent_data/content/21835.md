# Arc furnace electrode clamps.

## Abstract
A furnace electrode clamp comprises a metallic body portion 3 , an electrically insulated U shaped band 7 mounted for movement about the body and adapted to embrace the electrode 8 and at least one preferably two electrode contact piece s 13 mounted on the body and against which the electrode is clamped by the band. The or each contact piece is made from highly conductive material and is water cooled. The small surface over which contact is made enables a high force unit area to be established at the contact electrode interface than hitherto and the direct water cooling facility enables higher current densities to be withstood.
