A starting fuel supply system for an internal combustion engine 101 , comprising an electronic injection system, and processing means 102 which, prior to stroke identification of the engine 101 , cause fuel to be supplied to more than one injector 116 , including the injector relative to the cylinder first reaching the ignition point subsequent to such identification, and which has already completed the induc tion stroke, thus enabling substantially total intake of the fuel injected into the cylinder.
