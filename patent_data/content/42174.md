# Process for dry desulfurization of flue gas.

## Abstract
Sulfur oxides contained in the flue gas from coal fired boilers are adsorbed by an adsorbent prepared by dry distilling a portion of fuel coal satisfying at least one of requirements of an ash content lower than 15 by weight and a fixed carbon content of at least 50 by weight, thereby producing semi coke, and activating the semi coke by steam, and then the sulfur oxides adsorbed adsorbent is heated to desorb the adsorbed sulfur oxides at a high concentration. The desorbed sulfur oxides are passed through a bed of semi coke before the activation to recover the sulfur oxides as elemental sulfur.
