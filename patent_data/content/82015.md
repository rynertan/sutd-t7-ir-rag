# Method of forming an image with a photographic cuprous halide material.

## Abstract
A method of forming an image is described which comprises imagewise exposing a photosensitive material comprising a support having thereon a photosensitive copper I halide emulsion and that optionally contains silver halide and which has grains of the copper I halide crystal dispersed in a binder, and developing it with an alkaline solution containing at least one compound from each of at least two of the following three groups A an amino acid, amino acid derivative, aliphatic carboxylic acid, hydroxy oxycarboxylic acid, ketocarboxylic acid, aromatic carboxylic acid, aminocarboxylic acids, quinoline derivative, pyridine derivative, amine or amine derivative, which amine or amine derivative forms a Cu II complex having a stability constant from 5 to 15 B a 4 aminophenol or 3 pyrazolidone and C an ascorbic acid derivative of the following formula
