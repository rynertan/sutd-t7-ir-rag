## Description
Monoclonal antibodies, processes for their preparation and methods for their use The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies specific for bovine serum albumin, processes for their preparation and methods for their use. Bovine serum albumin is a type of protein present in bovine serum. Its molecular weight is 66,000. Usually, serum of adult cattle, calves or foetal cattle is added to various culture media. Even when such a serum is removed from the culture medium, the presence of bovine serum albumin is often retained as a source of protein.Thus, where any useful substance is produced by culturing animal tissues and is then purified or isolated from the tissue culture, it is sometimes necessary to remove bovine serum albumin from the product by a known method.However, in many cases, the bovine serum albumin cannot necessarily be easily removed. It is known that antisera polyclonal antibodies having a degree of specifacity for bovine serum albumin may be induced by immunizing animals of different species such as mice, and then rcavered from the animal and used for the removal of bovine serum albumin. However, the antisera obtained arenot uniform and there is moreover the further difficulty of poor specificity in that the antisera may be reactive with other serum albumins originating from other animals sach as human serum albumin. The present invention is based on the di covery of monoclonal antibodies specific for bovine serum albumin and processes for their preparation and on the discovery that such monoclonal antibodies may be used for isolating bovine serum albumin from a bovine serum albumin containing material. Thus according to one feature of the present invention there are provided monoclonal antibodies specific for bovine serum albumin. The monoclonal antibodies are preferably of the IgG isotype, especially the sub class IgG1. The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are advantageously in substantially pure form and may if desired be in the form of an antiserum. According to a further feature of the present invention there are provided monoclones for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies of the present invention. The monoclones are preferably prepared according to the process described hereinafter for the preparation of the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention or by such steps thereof as are necessary. Selection of the monoclones may for example be effected on the basis of their reactivity with bovine serum albumin and their lack of reactivity with other related albumins. According to a still further feature of the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a monoclonal antibody of the present invention which comprises immunizing a mammal with bovine serum albumin to produce cells capable of producing antibodies in the body of said mammal, fusing said cells with lined myeloma cells originating from a mammal other than the immunized mammal, selecting the resultant fused cells for the production of antibodies specific for bovine serum albumin, subjecting the selected fused cells to cloning to prod√∫cetmonocloness, selecting the resultant mcnoclones for reactivity with at least one member selected from bovine serum albumin and other related albumins, culturing the selected monoclones and recovering the desired monoclonal antibody from the culture thereby obtained. The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention may be prepared in the following manner. 1 Preparation of immunized animal cells Mammals such as rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, goats, horses, cattle and the like may be immunized e.g. in conventional manner with bovine serum albumin.Those cells produced which are capable of producing the corresponding antibodies are collected from the immunized mammal. For example, bovine serum albumin 20 400 Fg per animal may be injected into the vein or abdominal cavity of a mouse 8 10 weeks old optionally together with an appropriate adjuvant such as complete Freundas adjuvant, aluminium hydroxide gel, pertussis vaccine and the like, the bovine serum albumin and adjutant preferably being present in equal amounts.Advantageously subsequent immunizations may be effected for example 2 10 times with an interval of e.g. 1 2 weeks. For example 3 7 days after each immunization, blood may be collected, e.g. from the retinal artery plexus and used to investigate the titre of anti bovine serum albumin antibody e.g. by means of enzymoimmunoassay techniques such as the solid phase sandwich method see the method described in Koso lien eki Sokutei ho , published by Igaku Shoin, Japan 1978 in the following manner. 1 bovine serum albumin BSA dissolved in a phosphate buffer solution PBS lbovine serum albumin 10g disodium phosphate 1.83q monopotassium phosphate 0.21a sodium chloride 7.65g and distilled water one litre pH 7.2 is poured into each well of a 96 well EIA plate commercial product of FlowLaboratories, U.S.A. in an amount of 100 200 1 per well and allowed to stand at 40C overnight. After removal of the BSAJPBS solution, each well is washed with deionized water.Then, as a primary antibody, human serum albumin multiply diluted with PBS tcontaining mouse serum, supernatant of the hybridoma cells and crude monoclonal antibodies 100 1 per welll is allowed to stand at 40C overnight. The EIA plate is washed once with deionized water and six times with 2M NaC1. After this, as a secondary antibody, a combined product of anti mouse immunoglobulin F ab 2 with urease commercial product of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Australia CSL J diluted to X100 is poured into each well in an amount of 100 1 per well and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours.The plate is washed 3 times with deionized water, and then an urease substrate solution commercial product of CSL, Australia is poured into each well in an amount of 100 pl per well and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 30 minutes. After this, the reaction is discontinued for example by adding 1 methylthiolate 20 1 per well to the reaction mixture. The antibody titre is conveniently determined by colorimetric determination at 600 nm. Where the antibody titre of the serum derived from any mouse reaches more than 103 times the corresponding titre of mouse normal serum against bovine serum albumin, such a mouse may be regarded as a useful source of immunized animal cells and may be term qualified . In order to prepare the hybridoma cells, bovine serum albumin 20 400 Fg per animal is preferably administered to the immunized animal 3 4 days before hybridization. Then, for example, the spleen cells may be collected from the animal in conventional manner and used to prepare the desired hybridoma cells. 2 Preparation of myeloma cells Suitable lined cells of mouse origin may conveniently be used as the myeloma cells, for example myeloma cells of 8 azaguanine resistant mice of BALBIc strain ,such asP3 X63 Ag8 Ul P3 Ul Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 81. 1 7 1978 , P3 NSI l Ag4.l NS l European J. Immunology, 6, 511 519 1976 , SP2 0 Ag14 SP 2 Nature, 276, 269 270 1978 , P3 X63 Ag8.653 653 J. Immunology, 123, 1548 1550 1979 , P3 X63 Ag8 X63 nature, 256, 495 497 1975 and the like.These cell lines may be subcultured, for example, by using a known 8 azaguanine medium. 3 4 Days before hybridization, the myeloma cells are preferably subcultured,,,for example by using a normal medium so as to ensure the number of 7 cells is more than 2 X 10 on the date of hybridization. 3 Fusion For example, the spleen cells thus obtained and the myeloma cells obtained by the above mentioned step 2 are mixed together, the ratio of the number of spleen cells to the number of myeloma cells being preferably 5 10 1. The cells are fused in conventional manner, for example by using a mixed solution of polyethylene glycol 1000 PEG 1000 1 4 g , ME24 1 4 ml and dimethyl sulfoxide. 0.5 1 ml conveniently in an amount of 0. 1 1 ml per 108 spleen cells. The cell suspension is poured into each well of a culture plate for incubation at 35 400C for 10 30 hours in an incubator containing 3 7 CO2. To each well of the plate is added a HAT medium for further culturing for 10 14 days in conventional manner. During the culturing the HAT medium is replaced for example 3 times with a newHAT medium. After this, the medium is replaced by HT medium in conventional manner for further culturing. After culturing for example for 3 4 days by using HT medium, part of the supernatant is collected to determine the titre of anti bovine serum albumin antibody .g. by the above mentioned enzymoimmunoassay method. If desired, radioimmunoassay may be used solely or in combination therewith. Similarly, the reactivities of the fused cells with human serum albumin, egg white albumin and the like are also investigated to select those which are specifically reactive with bovine serum albumin. The fused cells which are strongly reactive with bovine serum albumin and unreactive with human serum albumin and egg white albumin are selected. They are subjected to cloning e.g. twice by the limiting dilution method to obtain hybridoma cells which are stable and capable of producing anti bovine serum albumin antibodies. 4 Preparation of monoclonal antibodies The hybridoma cells, recognized as those capable of producing anti bovine serum albumin antibodies, are, 6 for example, administered in an amount of 2 4 X 10 cells animal to a pristan 2,6,10,1 4 tetramethylpentadecane treated BALB c mouse female 8 10 weeks old for example by abdominal injection. 10 21 days after this, ascites tumour is induced by the hybridoma cells.The ascites collected from the mouse is preferably centrifuged to remove solid impurities, and the salting out of the supernatant is conveniently effected twice e.g. with 50 and 40 ammonium sulfate respectively, followed by for example dialysis for 1 2 days against a PBS solution pH 7.2 . The resultant residual fraction may be passed through a column packed, for example, with DEAE cellulose, protein A Sepharose 4B and the like to collect IgG fractions which may then be used as purified monoclonal antibodies. The binding activity and inhibiting activity of the monoclonal antibody are assayed for example by the above mentioned enzymoimmunoassay method in order to investigate the specificity of the monoclonal antibody. The isotype of the monoclonal antibody may be determined by Ouchterlony s method double diffusion test see wMen eki gaku jikken Nyumon, Seibutus kagakuJikken ho, 15, page 74 1981 published by GakkaiShuppan Centre, Japan. Quantitative determination of protein may be effected according for example to the method of Folin and the optical density at 280 cm 1.4 OD280 zvimmunoglobulin 1 mg ml . In this manner, we have found that the monoclonal antibody which we have designated KM 10 and which is obtained from hybridoma cells which we have designated Ki 10 hybridoma cells is of the IgG1 isotype, and its specificity is shown in Example 1 described hereinafter. According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a process for isolating bovine serum albumin from a bovine serum albumin containing material, which process comprises adsorbing bovine serum albumin using a monoclonal antibody of the present invention. The process thus provides for example a method for reriroving bovine serum albumin from a culture medium, for example containing a desired substance e.g. a proteinaceous substance such as interferon or a method of purifying a desired substance e.g. a proteiriaceous substance such as interferon K which for example has been prepared by culturing and has been recovered therefrom, but which is contaminated with bovine serum albumin. The process is conveniently effected by affinity chromatography known per se. The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are conveniently immobilized by the use of an appropriate carrier e.g. by reaction with a cyanogen bromideactivated exchange resin e.g. CNBr Sepharose 4B. In a further embodiment of the present invention there is provided a composition, e.g. in the form of an affinity column, for adsorbing bovine serum albumin comprising a monoclonal antibody of the present invention immobilized on a carrier therefor. Such a composition according to the invention may be used for any convenient purpose as described above such as the purification of a desired substance obtained by culturing animal tissue e. g. interferon . Thus by using the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention, bovine serum albumin may be removed from proteinaceous substances containing bovine serum albumin, for example, in the following manner A monoclonal antibody of the present invention e.g.KM 10 lOmg may for example be dissolved in a PBS solution e.g. 1 10 ml and then for example subjected to reaction with an appropriate carrier such as for example CNBractivated Sepharose 4B 1 ml commercial product ofPharmacia Fine Chemicals AB., Sweden to obtain an immobilized monoclonal antibody. The resultant immobilized monoclonal antibody may then be packed into a column and a solution of bovine serum albumin not more than 5 mg may then be passed through the column. In this manner, it is possible to adsorb 99 100t of bovine serum albumin on the column. Where a sample containing proteins other than bovine serum albumin is passed through the column, such other proteins are not adsorbed by the column. Where the ratio of monoclonal antibody to bovine serum albumin is over the range 2 1 by weight, a single passage through the column may result in almost complete removal of the bovine serum albumin contained in the sample solution. It is also possible to remove the bovine serum albumin contained in the column almost completely, for example, by eluting with a 0.O1 O.lxglycine HCl buffer solution and the like so that it is possible to reuse the antibody column of the present invention, for example, 5 10 times. If desired the bovine serum albumin may be recovered from the eluant. With regard to the drawing, Figure 1 shows that a column containing 10g of immobilized monoclonal antibody of the present invention is capable of completely adsorbing bovine serum albumin up to an amount of 4 mg, after which the column gradually becomes saturated and further bovine serum albumin ceases to be effectively adsorbed. The drawing plots volume of effluent against optical density absorbance at 280 nm and reflects the result of Example 2 described hereinafter. Example 1 1 Preparation of the spleen cells of immunized mice 5 Female mice BALTIC strain 8 weeks old purchased from Shizuoka ken Jikken Dobutsu Nogyo KyodoKumiai, Japan were immunized by abdominal injection of bovine serum albumin 100 iig animal commercial product of Fraction V. Sigma, U.S.A. in association with as adjuvants aluminium hydroxide gel 2 mg animal and 9 inactivated pertussis vaccine 1 X 10 cells animal commercial product of Chiba ken Kessei Kenkyusho, Japan .Subsequent immunizations were effected after an interval of one week by abdominal injection of bovine serum albumin 100 gg animal on each occasion . After the tertiary immunization, 5 7 days after each immunization, blood was collected from the retinal artery plexus of the eye to investigate the titre of the anti bovine serum albumin antibody by the above mentioned solid phase method for enzymoimmunoassay. One week after the tertiary immunization, all mice showed positive antibody titres. However, additional immunizations were carried out twice, and thus all animals were immunized 5 times in total. 3 Days after the final immunization, the spleen was collected from each mouse in conventional manner and used for fusion of the cells. 2 Preparation of mouse myeloma cells P3 Ul myeloma cells of 8 azaguanine resistant mice were cultured by using a normal medium IRPMI 1640 containing glutamine 1.5 mM , 2 mercaptoethanol 5 X 10 M , gentamicin 10 g ml and foetal calf serum 0.1 ml ml jfor 4 days to obtain more than 2 X 10 cells. 3 Preoarationof hybridoma cells The spleen cells of immunized mice 1 X 108 were washed with MEM medium commercial product of NissuiSeiyaku K.K., Japan and mixed with 1 X 10 P3 Ul myeloma cells originating from 8 azaguanine resistant mice. The mixture was centrifuged 1200 r.p.m. 5 minutes to give a precipitate of the mixed cells. The mixed cells were loosened, and a solution 0.5 ml containing a mixture of polyethylene glycol 1000 PEG 1000 2 g , MEM medium 2 ml and dimethylsulfoxide 0.7 ml was then added thereto. One minute after this, MEM medium 1 ml was added to the cell suspension. Subsequently, MEM medium was added to the cell suspension five times 1 ml each time with an interval of one minute.After this, the total amount of MEM medium in the suspension was made up to 50 ml with further addition of the same medium. The suspension was centrifuged 900 r.p.m. to remove the supernatant. The resultant mass of cells was loosened, a normal medium 100 ml added thereto and the cells loosened by using a messpipet. The cell suspension was poured into the wells of a 24 well culture plate commercial product of FIow Laboratory, U.S.A. in an amount of one ml per well, followed by incubating at 370C for 24 hours ty using aCO2 incubator. After adding to the plate a HAT medium prepared by adding hypoxanthine 10 M , thymidine 1.5 X 10 5M and aminopterin 4 X107y the culturing was effected for 24 hours. After removal of the supernatant 1 ml , a new HAT medium 1 ml was added to each medium for further culturing at 370C for 10 14 days. The presence of the fused cells grown infthe form of colonies was found in certain wills, from which, on each occasion, the supernatant 1 ml was removed and replaced by new HT medium 1 ml prepared by removing aminopterin from HAT medium as above mentioned for culturing at 370C. Such replacement by HT medium and further culturing were continued for the next 4 days,Then part of the supernatant was collected from each of the qualified cultures for assaying the titre of the antibovine serum albumin antibodies by the solid phase enzymoimmunoassay method as hereinbefore described. The fused cells exhibiting sufficient antibody titres were collected from the wells and subjected to cloning twice by the limiting dilution method to obtain clones having stability and qualified antibody titres. The resultant monoclones were recognized as the hybridoma cells capable of producing anti bovine serum albumin antibodies. Among 10 clones obtained, the one having the highest activity was selected and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies,thisclone being designated as KM 10. 4 Partial purification of monoclonal antibodies Pristan 2,6,10,1 4 tetramethyl pentadecane 0.5 ml animal was abdominally administered to BALB c female mice 8 weeks old which were bred for 2 weeks. Then, the above mentioned hybridoma cells 4 X 106 cells mouse on each occasion were administered to the mice by abdominal injection. 10 21 Days after this, an ascites tumour was induced by the hybridoma cells. 10 21 Days after this, ascites 4 10 ml mouse was collected from the mice, from which solid materials were removed by centrifugation. The salting out of the supernatant waseffected twice using SO and 40 ammonium su fatesolution respectively, followed by dialysis against a PBS solution pH.7.2 for 2 days to obtain partially purified monoclonal antibodies. The residual solution 10.2 ml 31 g ml was chromatographed by using a column 11 X 20 cm packed with DEAErcellulose 76 ml commercial product of PharmaciaFine Chemicals AB., Sweden . The effluent was divided into fractions each 1 ml . The fractions containingIgG Nos. 4 5 were collected and combined to obtain a purified monoclonal antibody, the presence of a single antibody being confirmed by electrophoresis. 5 Antigenic specificity of the purified monoclonal antibody The antigenic specificity of the purified monoclonal antibody was assayed by the solid phase method for assaying the immunological enzyme activity. As antigens, bovine serum albumin BSA commercial product of SigmaU.S.A. , human serum albumin HSA commercial product ofMidori Juji K.K., Japan , casein CA and egg white albumin OVA commercial product of Sigma, U.S.A. and foetal calf serum FCS commercial product of CSL,Australia were used to obtain the results shown inTable 1.

An antibody was mixed with an inhibitor for reaction at 370C for 30 minutes. The reaction product is used as a primary antigen for the enzyme immunization method. The results are shown in Table 2.

Example 2 Monoclonal antibody KM l0 specific for bovine serum albumin was prepared by the method of Example 1.10 mg of KM 10 in a carbonate buffer solution containing 0.lM NaHCO3 and 0.5M NaCl and having a pH of 8.3 was reacted with CNBr activated Sepharose 4B 1 ml commercial product of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB.,Sweden at room temperature for 2 hours to prepare an immobilized monoclonal antibody. The resultant immobilized monoclonal antibody was packed in a column 1 ml , and 0.5 mg ml of bovine serum albumin in a carbonate buffer solution 0.1M NaHCO3 and 0.5M NaCl pH 8.3 was passed through the column at a velocity of 6.7 ml hour. The effluent was divided into small fractions each 1 ml , and the absorbances of each fraction at 280 nm are shown in Fig. 1. From Fig. 1, it is apparent that a column containing 10 gof the immobilized monoclonal antibody is capable of completely adsorbing up to 4 mg in total of bovine serum albumin 0.5 mg ml X 8 ml . Furthermore it is also possible to recover the bovine serum albumin adsorbed onto the column by passing a 0.04M glycine hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 2.3 through the column, the recovery ratio being nearly 100 . The column may thus be reused.Example 3 A similar KM 10 column to that described in Example 2 was used under similar conditions. A solution of a carbonate buffer O.lM Nal4CO3 and 0.5to NaCl pH 8.3 1 ml containing bovine serum albumin 1 mg , ribonuclease 1 mg , chymotrypsinogen 1 mg and egg white albumin 1 mg was passed through the column and the effluent was investigated by electrophoresis. It was found that ribonuclease, chymotrypsinogen and egg white albumin were not adsorbed and these substances were found in the effluent. Bovine serum albumin was not found in the effluent, but was retained in the column. Only bovine serum albumin was recovered from the climun by passing a 0.04M glycinehydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 2.3 through the column. Thus, the column is capable of selectively adsorbing only bovine serum albumin from a mixture of proteins.
