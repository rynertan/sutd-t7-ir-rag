# Process for preparation of organic acid halide.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of organic acid halide such as acetyl chloride by reacting an organic acid anhydride with a silicon halide, such as silicon tetrachloride, under conditions such that the organic acid halide is produced along with silica which is easily separated and disposed of. A Lewis Acid metal halide catalyst is used and superior yields are obtained. The reaction is desirably carried out in the presence of a chlorohydrocarbon solvent in which the metal halide catalyst chosen and the reactants and products are soluble.
