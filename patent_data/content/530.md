# Feedback control for reduction of cogging torque in controlled current AC motor drives and method.

## Abstract
A decogging feedback control for current source inverter motor drives uses a change of instantaneous torque feedback signal with no dc component that is a function of only the instantaneous pulsating component of measured torque. The change of torque signal modulates the voltage applied to the dc link and therefore the dc link current to materially reduce the detrimental cogging torque pulsations and stabilize the motor, and can be switched out at a low frequency above which it is not needed so that the motor can respond properly to rapid variations in torque.
