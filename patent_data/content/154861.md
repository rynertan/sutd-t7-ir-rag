# Reflection mirror.

## Abstract
A reflection mirror using a liquid crystal cell 50 is dis closed. A first thin film 8a consisting of one of magnesium di fluoride, silicon dioxide, silicon monoxide or titanium dioxide is formed on a glass substrate 3b supporting the liquid crystal cell and a thin aluminium film 8b formed on the first thin film 8a as a reflection mirror layer. Adhesiveness of the thin alumi nium film to the glass substrate is strengthened by the first thin film. A second thin film 8c is formed on the thin aluminium film 8b to protect the same from being hurt. The reflection mirror may be used as a dazzle free reflection mirror of an automotive vehicle.
