# Method for forming a carbide layer on the surface of a ferrous alloy article or a cemented carbide article.

## Abstract
A method for forming a carbide layer on the surface of a carbon containing ferrous alloy article or a cemented carbide article in a molten treating bath. The bath is prepared by introducing 5 to 20 by weight of alumina into molten boric acid or borate bath and a carbide forming element dissolved therein. By employing the treating bath of this invention, the life of the bath can be remarkably improved, and no sintered substance of undissolved carbide forming element is pro duced in the treating bath. Further, it is possible to reduce markedly the corrosion of the article and of the vessel holding the bath.
