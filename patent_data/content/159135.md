# Method and apparatus for drilling hard material.

## Abstract
A hole is drilled in a front 9 of hard material, such as rock, by fragmenting the hard material with impact hammers 13a along a plurality of spaced apart paths extending in parallel planes P₁, P₂,P₃ , each of which extends in a plane different from the planes in which the adjacent paths extend. The hammers 13a are mounted in parallel, spaced apart relationship on a support 15 , each hammer having a head 17 spaced from the support 15 by a different distance from the adjacent hammer heads. The hammers 13a are driven towards the front 9 by a motorized vehicle 5 , and are simultaneously reciprocated in a plane parallel to the front 9 The fragmentation by impact along the paths causes simultaneous fragmentation by shear between the paths.
