# Thermoplastic elastomeric composition and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic elastomeric compositions are prepared by mixing powdered vulcanized rubber having a mean particle size of below 1,5 mm and a thermoplastic olefin or diolefin polymer, particular polyethyleen, in a weight ratio of from 1 3 to 3 1, and a non ionic surfactant in an amount of 0, 1 5 wt. referring to the total amount of polymers. The addition of a non ionic surfactant greatly improves the bonding between the two main components, thus yielding compositions of a very low level of porosity and improved mechanical properties, particularly superior toughness. The compositions can be moulded or extruded to a variety of products, as there are profiles, roofings, fencing posts, pallets, but also shoe soles, saddle covers, solid tyres, sprinkling funnels, etc.
