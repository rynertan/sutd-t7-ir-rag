## Description
PLANT GROWTH REGULATING COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF REGULATING THE GROWTH OF A PLANT Summary of the Invention This invention relates to plant growth regulating compositions and methods for their use. The compositions comprise an active ingredient in an inert agricultural carrier, said active ingredient having the formula R CH N wherein R is phenyl, phenylethenyl, or C1 to C12 alkyl and R is phenyl or C1 to C12 alkyl. Some compositions of the above formula are relatively unstable and further react upon standing to form dimers of the formula EMI1.1 wherein Rn is C1 to C10 alkyl.Certain of these materials, particularly those bearing anilino groups, may further react upon heating to form RNH2 and a compound of the formula R N CH CR C CH2 R or upon hydration a compound of the formula EMI1.2 These further reaction products are within the scope of the invention. When an effective amount of the compositions is applied to root, fiber, oil or grain crops, particularly those planted in sandy organic soils, increased height, weight and or yield is commonly observed. Effective amounts of the active ingredients range from 0.01 to 0.5 pounds per acre. The compounds favorably affect plant growth so as to permit earlier planting while temperature conditions remain cool. The compositions preferably contain compounds selected from the group consisting of N l methylpropyl benzylideneiminef N dodecylbenzylideneimine, N phenylbenzylideneimine, N tbutylcinnamylideneimine and N phenylpropylideneimine. The compositions may contain additional ingredients including, but not limited to, certain phenols, aldehydes and fertilizers. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention provides plant growth regulating compositions and methods for their use. The compositions contain various Schiff bases as active ingredients for enhancing plant growth. The active ingredients are dissolved, dispersed or otherwise combined with an inert carrier, suitable for agricultural use, and are applied to the soil or a plant in effective amounts, generally ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 pounds per acre. More specifically, the active compounds of the invention are Schiff bases having the formula R CH N R I wherein R is phenyl, phenylethenyl or an alkyl group having one to twelve carbons and R is phenyl or an alkyl group having one to twelve carbons. Thus, for example, R may be methyl, ethyl, N propyl, i propyl, 2 methylpropyl, n butyl, dodecyl, phenyl or 2 phenylethenyl and R may be methyl, ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, l methylpropyl, 2 methylpropyl, n bityl, t butyl or phenyl. Preferred compounds include N l methylpropylbenzylideneimine, N dodecylbenzylideneimine,N phenylbenzylideneimine, N t butylcinnamylideneimine and N phenylpropyl ideneimine. Included within the above formula are certain materials which upon standing at ambient conditions or upon slight heating react to form dimers of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is C1 to C10 alkyl. Heating may cause amine elimination and hydration of the resulting alkene double bond. These reactions may proceed as follows EMI3.2 tb R SEP SEP N SEP SEP CH SEP SEP CH SEP SEP R SEP heat SEP SEP RNH2 SEP SEP R SEP SEP N SEP SEP CH SEP SEP C SEP SEP C SEP tb SEP R SEP SEP NH SEP SEP CH SEP SEP CH2 SEP SEP RM SEP R tb SEP R SEP SEP NH SEP SEP CH SEP SEP CR2 SEP SEP Rn tb SEP acid base SEP Ez SEP N SEP zl SEP CH SEP SEP CH SEP C SEP SEP CH SEP SEP extr√°ctioS SEP R SEP SEP N SEP SEP CH SEP SEP 2 tb SEP RW SEP OH tb For example, N phenylpropylidineimine, wherein R is methyl andR is phenyl, reacts according to the above sequence. The invention includes Schiff bases which are produced via the above reactions, particularly those which are produced due to instability of the products described by the above formulaI. The invention thus encompasses dimers of unstable materials such as N phenylpropylidineimine. References herein to such unstable Schiff base monomers include not only the monomers but also further Schiff base products such as dimers and their deamination and hydration products which spontaneously form under normal conditions of use. It is also to be understood that salts of the compounds above described are within the scope of the invention. s The active compounds may be prepared by reacting an aldehyde of the formula R CHO, wherein R is as defined above, with a primary amine of the formula H2N R , wherein R is as defined above. Such reaction proceeds as follows EMI3.3 The reaction is generally effected in an inert solvent for both reactants at the reflux temperature of the solvent, preferably employing equimolar portions of the aldehyde and amine to minimize purification problems. Preferably the solvent employed during the reaction is a solvent for the product Schiff base as well as the reactants. Further it is desirable to employ solvents having boiling points in the range below about 100 C. Suitable solvents include aliphatic ketones or alcohols. Aromatic solvents can be employed but can be expected to result in precipitation of the product on cooling. Among the preferred solvents, in descending order of preference, are acetone, 2 butanone, 2 butanol and ethanol. As noted above, the reaction is generally effected at the reflux temperature of the solvent employed. The reflux is continued until the reaction is complete. Completion of the reaction can be detected by IR monitoring the carbonyl peak.Typically no more than about 6 8 hours are required to complete the reaction. The active ingredients are admixed with an inert carrier to form the compositions of the invention. For purposes of the present application the term inert carrier refers to carriers which are not chemically reactive with the active ingredient and which are suitable for use in agriculture. The most preferred carrier is water. Acetone and urea ammonium nitrate solutions may also be employed. The carrier is employed in B amount which will permit application of the active compound in an effective amount. Thus the carrier amount is a function of manageable application rates. The active compound is preferably uniformly dispersed, suspended or dissolved in the carrier to form a homogeneous mixture. To accomplish uniform suspension in an aqueous carrier, the active compound may be dissolved in a solvent which is completely soluble or miscible in after prior to addition to the aqeuous carrier. A preferred solvent for this purpose is aliphatic ether alcohol, particularly that sold asDowanol EB Dow Chemical Corp. . The amount of such solvent is a function of the solubility of the active compound therein that is, sufficient solvent must be employed to achieve complete dissolution of the active ingredient. The compositions may additionally contain an emul sifier in amounts sufficient to maintain or stabilize the active compound in the aqueous carrier. An example of such an emulsifier is Pluronic P 104, BASF Wyandotte . Other ingredients may be present in the compositions of the invention provided they are chemically inert relative to the active compound. For example, aldehydes and acetylacetone may be present as additional solvents and possibly as aids to penetration of the active ingredient. Phenols, including alkyl substituted phenols, are preferred additives for purposes of the present invention. For example, compositions of the invention may include 4 nonyl phenol in an equimolar amount relative to the active ingredients of the invention. The compositions may also contain fertilizers, as when they are applied in conjunction with aqueous urea ammonium nitrate solution. At higher rates of fertilizer application, however, the positive effects of the compositions of the invention may be masked. Examples of compositions useful in the practice of the present invention are those containing 30 90 weight percent Dowanol EB, 5 60 weight percent Pluronic P 104, 1 10 weight percent active ingredient and 0 10 weight percent yde or acetylacetone in an aqueous carrier. Of the formulations tested, those preferred contained 38.05 weight percent Dowanol EB, 57.58 weight percent Pluronic P 104 and 4.38 weight percent active ingredient or 36.45 weight percent DowanolEB, 55.16 weight percent Pluronic P 104, 4.19 weight percent cinnamaldehyde or acetylacetone and 4.19 weight percent active ingredient suspended in an aqueous carrier. Overall, preferred compositions contain as little emulsifier as necessary to maintain or stabilize the active compound in the aqueous carrier.Compositions containing nonyl aldehyde or methyl cinnamaldehyde have generally not been found particularly effective in the practice of the present invention. The compositions of the invention generally stimulate plant growth. For example, the compositions enhance plant size, yield, root and or plant strength or hardiness when applied at rates of 0.01 to 0.5 pounds active ingredient per acre. At higher rates of application no further substantial increase in plant growth is generally observed and in some cases higher rates adversely affected plant growth. Lower rates of application, i.e. about 0.01 to about 0.2 pounds per acre, are most preferred. Beneficial growth effects may be observed both when the compositions are applied to the soil, either before or after plant 6 g, and when they are applied to the emergent plant. For purposes of the present invention, treatment of a plant with the compositions of the invention includes direct application to the emergent plant, as well as application to or incorporation in the soil prior to emergence and or planting. For purposes of this application, treatments involving direct application to seed are excluded from the term plant treatment.Direct seed treatment is not an acceptable mode of application since such application can adversely affect seed germination.Soil application is not a direct seed treatment of the type herein contemplated. Soil application of the compositions of the invention permits planting of crops while conditions are still relatively cold. By incorporating the compositions into the soil before or at the time of planting, plants having root systems and strength sufficient to survive relatively harsh temperature conditions early in the planting season are produced. The compositions thus effectively extend the growing season. When the compositions of the invention are used to treat plants grown in organic soils having a high sand content growth is most favorably enhanced. On the other hand, planting in clay soile results in less favorable growth effects. Among the plants whose growth is positively affected by the compositions of the invention are grain crops, specifically milo sweet and field corn, fiber crops, specifically cotton, oil crops, specifically soybeans or sunflowers, and root crops, specifically sugar beets. Effective modes and rates of application vary from crop to crop. General guidelines are set forth below. In the case of field corn, incorporation of the compositions of the invention into the soil prior to planting or application to the soil after planting but before emergence at rateaof 0.01 to 0.25 pounds active compound per acre results in increased plant height, plant weight and root volume. Application of the compositions after emergence of field corn plants produces a negative effect on growth. When the compositions are applied to sweet corn at rates of 0.01 to 0.1 pounds active ingredient per acre, an increased height and fruit yield is observed. Such beneficial effects exist whether the compositions are applied by incorporation into the soil prior to planting, by application to the soil surface after planting or during the early stages of emergence. During the late stages of plant emergence, negative growth effects may occur. When cotton is treated with compositions of the invention, either by incorporation in or surface application to the soil, at rates of 0.01 to 0.1 pounds active ingredient per acre, an increased yield of cotton fibers is observed. Moreover, such fibers have greater length and strength. Pre plant incorporation of materials of the invention in sandy soils during the early stages of the cotton growing season at rates of 0.05 to 0.1 pounds per acre has produced significant positive growth effects. Sugar beets, treated with 0.01 to 0.5 pounds active ingredient per acre exhibit increased yield. Further the sugar beets yield a greater percentage sucrose. The examples below are illustrative of the invention.In the examples, references to AI mean active ingredient.Numerical values set forth in parentheses are percent change in treated plant relative tO control. References in the examples, to N mean nitrogen, while those to N A mean nitrogen per acre.Where a single asterisk appears adjacent a result, a signifi cant change exists relative to the control at a least signify cant difference LSD of 0.05. Similarly a double asterisk tut indicates a significant change at LSD .01. EXAMPLE 1 Active compounds of the invention were prepared in the manner described below.

Surface application was effected by applying the experimental chemical to the soil surface, watering and then planting the seeds one week later. Ten inch high nursery pots were used in the test.The formulations were applied in a 28 Urea Ammonium Nitrate solution UAN carrier. The amount of UAN solution was adjusted tb furnish the equivalent of 100 pounds nitrate per acre for field corn and 50 pounds nitrogen per acre for cotton. Growth responses were measured after six weeks. Plant height was measured from the soil level to the top of the tallest leaf in corn and to the average height in cotton. Green weight was measured by weighing the portion of the plant above the soil level. The results are set forth in Tables 2 3.

All treatments were applied in acetone as a carrier because of their solubility. In some cases either crotonaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde was incorporated into the composition in an amount equal to the weight of active ingredient. The compositions were applied at a rate of 15 gallons of acetone per acre by a tractor mounted sprayer applying them over the top of six ounce cups of clay loam soil.The treatments were mixed into each cup of soil by dumping the cup into a plastic bag, shaking it, and putting the soil back into individual cups. Two days after treatment, corn and cotton were planted. Planting depth was 0.5 inch. Each pot received three seeds of the crop designated for that pot. Six replications were utilized in this study. After emergence, plant heights, ratings, and green weights were determined. Plant heights were obtained by simply measuring from the soil level to the top of the average height in cotton, and by the soil level to the top of the tallest leaf in corn. Visual ratings of color were obtained on corn simply byvisually estimating the greenness of the plant. Fresh weights were obtained as a harvest after the study was completed simply by cutting the plants at the soil level and weighing them. Very definite effects from the compositions were seen 0 in both cotton and corn. In cotton there were very definite differences in terms of height and also in fresh weight, with some compounds showing decreased fresh weight and decreased height, while others were showed increased fresh weight and increased height. Overall, the lower rate, .01 pound A, gave the most activity whether in corn or cotton. In corn, there was a difference in color and also differences in fresh weight were observed.Results of the tests are set forth in Table 10.

The compositions were applied both by incorporation in the upper 4 of sandy loam soil prior to planting and by application to the surface of the soil.Incorporation refers to incorporation of the experimental chemical into the soil followed by planting the seed immediately. Surface application was effected by applying the experimental chemical to the soil surface, watering and then planting the seed one week later. Ten inch high nursery pots were used in the test. The formulations were applied in a 28 Urea Ammonium Nitrate solution UAN carrier. The amount of UAN solution was adjusted to furnish the equivalent of 100 pounds nitrate per acre for field corn and 50 pounds nitrogen per acre for cotton.Growth responses were measured after six weeks. Plant height was measured from the soil level to the top of the tallest leaf in corn and to the average height in cotton. Green weight was measured by weighing the portion of the plant above the soil level. The results are set forth in Tables 2 3.

All treatments were applied in acetone as a carrier because of their solubility. In some cases either crotonaldehyde or cinnamaldehyde was incorporated into the composition in an amount equal to the weight of active ingredient. The compositions were applied at a rate of 15 gallons of acetone per acre by a tractor mounted sprayer applying them over the top of six ounce cups of clay loam soil.The treatments were mixed into each cup of soil by dumping the cup into a plastic bag, shaking it, and putting the soil back into individual cups. Two days after treatment, corn and cotton were planted. Planting depth was 0.5 inch. Each pot received three seeds of the crop designated for that pot.Six replications were utilized in this study. After emergence, plant heights, ratings, and green weights were determined. Plant heights were obtained by simply measuring from the soil level to the top of the average height in cotton, and by the soil level to the top of the tallest leaf in corn. Visual ratings of color were obtained on corn simply by visually estimating the greenness of the plant. afresh weights were obtained as a harvest after the study was corn dieted simply by cutting the plants at the soil level and weighing them. Very definite effects from the compositions were seen in bothcotton and corn. In cotton there were very definite differences in terms of height and also in fresh weight, with some compounds showing decreased fresh weight and decreased height, while others were showed increased fresh weight and increased he ght. Overall, the lnwer rate, .01 pound A, gave the most activity whether in corn or cotton. In corn, there was a difference in color and also differences in fresh weight were observed.Results of the tests are set forth in Table 10.
