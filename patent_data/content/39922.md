# APPARATUS FOR ULTRASONICALLY INSPECTING CIRCULAR BORES

## Abstract
Apparatus for ultrasonically inspecting material radially bounding a circular bore into which the apparatus is insert able. The apparatus includes a central housing 20 , three support arms 28 which are engageable with the bounding wall of the bore and are circumferentially equally spaced about the central housing 20 , parallel linkage arms 22,26 joining each support arm and the central housing for main taining a predetermined relative configuration between the support arms 28 and the bore wall, a transducer carrier 36 supported by each support arm and carrying an ultrasonic transducer 38 and means for biasing the transducers 38 radially outwardly relative to their associated carriers 36 . A pneumatically actuated cylinder is disposed in the housing 20 and connected to the linkage arms 22 for moving the support arms 28 radially outward into firm engagement with the bore wall. The transducers 38 are movable relative to the transducer carriers 36 within predetermined displacement limits and outward biasing means 44 of appropriate strength are provided to enable application of high centering forces on the support arms to coaxially align the housing with the bore s center line while independently providing relatively small, optimum engagement forces between the transducers and bore wall.
