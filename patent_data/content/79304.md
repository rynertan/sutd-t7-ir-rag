# Electrode holder for arc furnaces.

## Abstract
An electrode holder for electrodes used in electric arc furnaces, comprising a cooled metal shaft 1 that is sur rounded by a protective jacket 5 which is basically a hollow cylinder consisting of high temperature resistant moldings. The protective jacket surrounds and protects either that part of the electrode holder which is located within the furnace or the part in the clamping jaw zone. In order to create a protective jacket for the cooled metal shaft of electrode holders of the present type which fully meets all thermal, mechanical, and electrical requirements of electric arc opera tions, which has a simple design, which is easy to mount and to repair, which guarantees a good heat transfer to the cooled metal shaft, and in order to improve the service life of the protective jacket as such, the protective jacket 5 consists of individual moldings 10 which may be put together to rings, or of ring shaped moldings 80, which are connected among each other and or to the metal shaft 1 in a form locking and or resilient manner
