# Process for electrolyzing aqueous solution of alkali metal chloride.

## Abstract
An aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride is electrolyzed by feeding said aqueous solution of an alkali metal chloride into an anode compartment and feeding an oxvgen containing gas in a cathode compartment in an ion exchange membrane cell comprising said anode compart ment and said cathode compartment formed by partitioning an anode and a cathode with an ion exchange membrane to which a gas and liquid permeable porous layer made of inorganic particles having no anodic activity and a thickness thiner than the thickness of said ion exchange membrane is bonded and said cathode is an oxygen reducing cathode.
