# Zinc oxide catalyzed dealkylation of alkylated phenols.

## Abstract
Selective catalytic steam dealkylation of ortho and para positions of alkylated phenols is accomplished by reacting ortho and or para alkylated phenols with steam in the presence of a catalyst comprised of zinc oxide, optionally manganese oxide and optionally an organic binder and preferably an oxidizing atmosphere. High degrees of conver sion are obtained without loss of the hydroxyl group of the alkylated phenols.
