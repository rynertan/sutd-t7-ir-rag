# Immunoassay.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for providing an immunoassay of a binding reaction between a ligand and an antiligand which are typically an antigen and an antibody, including a spatial pattern formed by a spatial array of separate regions of antiligand material, and ligand material dispersed to interact with the spatial array of separate regions of anti ligand material for producing a binding reaction between the ligand and the antiligand in the spatial patterns and with the bound complexes labeled with a particular physical charac teristic. A source of input energy and with the input energy at a particular spectrum for interacting with particular physical characteristic of the labeled binding reaction. Scanning the spatial pattern with the input energy at the particular spectrum for producing output energy having amplitude levels formed by a substantially random background compo nent and a non random component representing the labeled bound complexes, and the non random component repre senting the labeled bound complexes detected to produce an output signal in accordance with the labeled binding reac tion.
