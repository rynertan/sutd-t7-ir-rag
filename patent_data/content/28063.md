The compounds according to the invention are potent antagonists of the action of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A as shown by their ability to inhibit the SRS A induced contraction of guinea pig ileum Coleman et al, Br. J. Pharmacol., 1979, 66, 83P . SRS A is a naturally occurring substance which causes contraction of smooth muscle, especially bronchial muscle, and increases vascular permeability. The substance is not normally present in human tissue but is synthesised and released from certain cells during an allergic reaction.The compounds according to the invention are thus indicated for use in the treatment of disorders in which SRS A may be a factor, for example, in obstructive airways diseases such as asthma, in hay fever and in skin afflictions. The compounds according to the invention may be formulated for use in human or veterinary medicine for therapeutic or prophylacicpurposes. The invention therefore includes within its scope pharmaceutical.compositions comprising as active ingredients one or more compounds selected from compounds of general formula I and physiologically acceptable addition salts thereof. Such compositions may be presented for use in a conventional manner with the aid of physiologically accep lable carriers or excipients and formulatory agents as required, and with or without supplementary medicinal agents. These compositions include, for instance, tablets, suppositories, injections and forms suitable or administration by inhalation. Injections may be formulated with the aid of physiologically acceptable carriers and agents as solutions, suspensions, or as dry products for reconstitution before use. For administration by inhalation the compounds are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurised packs or a nebuliser. The preferred composition for inhalation is a powder which may be formulated as a cartridge from which the powdered composition may be inhaled with the aid of a suitable device. In the case of a pressurised aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The doses of the active ingredient which may be used vary within a wide range. Suitable dosage units are generally within the range of 50 mg to 1000 mgXday which may be conveniently administered in two or three daily doses. The precise dose administered will always depend on he ag and condition of the patient. The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by a number of processes. According to one embodiment of the invention compounds of formula I may be prepared from the corresponding compounds of general formula III EMI6.1 in icll R1 to R5,and X are as previously defined and W represents OHO, E, ZE or OZ1E in which Z and Z1 are as previously defined and E represents a group which is convertible to the group A previously defined, such as a carboxylic ester, carboxamide or nitrile group. Thus, for example, a compound of the general formula 1 in which Y represents the group Cll CIIC021I may be prcl ared frozen the corresponding compound of general formula III in which W represents CHO, by the Perkin synthesis of cinnamic acids, as described in OrganicReactions, John Wiley Sons, New York, Vol I, pp 210265. A compound of general formula I , which Y represents the group A, ZA or OZ1A where Z and Z1 are as l reviously defined and A is a carboxylic acid group, may be prepared by acid or base hydrolysis of the corresponding compound of general formula III in which W represents the group E, ZE or OZ1E where E is a carboxylic ester, amide or nitrile group using standard conditions for example by hydrolysis with an acid such as aqueous sulphuric acid at an elevated temperature, or by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium llydroxide, potassium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide in a solvent such as ethanol, aqueous tetrahydrofuran or water at a temperature of 20 1000C. A compound of general formula I , in which Y represents the group A, ZA or OZ1A where Z and Z1 are as previously defined and A is a 5 111 tetrazolyl ring, may be prepared from the corresponding compound of general formula III in which W represents E, ZE or OZ1E and E represents a nitrile, using standard conditions, for examl3lc using a salt of hydrazoic acid in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or dioxan at an elevated temperature.. Suitable salts include sodium or ammonium azide. The reaction may be performed, for example, using sodium azide and ammonium chloride in dimethylformamide at a tempendture of 50 to 10000. A compound of general formula I in which Y 8represents the group A, ZA or OZ1 A where Z and Z1 are as previously defined and A is a carboxylic acid group, may be prepared by hydrogenolysis of the corresponding compound.of general formula III where W represents the group E, ZE or OZ1E where E is a carboxylie ester group of formulaCOOR7 and R7 is a group which may be removed by hydrogenolysis, or example an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl or benzhydryl group, using standard conditions, for example in the presence of a catalyst, such as platinum or palladium in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol e.g. ethanol. Tbis reaction may be conveniently employed con currently to reduce other groups in a compound of general formula III . For example, a compound of general formula I in which A is a carboxylic acid group and R3 is a C2 6 alkyl group, such as propyl, may be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding compound of general formula III where W represents the group E, ZE or oZlE where Z and Z1 are as previously defined and E is a carboxylic ester group, such as a benzyl ester group., and R is a C2 6 alkenyl group, such as propenyl. The intermediate compounds of formula III may be prepared by a number of processes. For example, the compounds of formula III may be obtained by alkylation of the corresponding phenols of general formula IV or V EMI9.1 with an appropriate alkylating agent of formula VI or VII respectively,EMI9.2 in which L is a leaving group for example a halogen atom or a paratoluenesulphonate or a methylsulphonate ester, in the presence of a base in a suitable solvent, for example sodium hydride in dimethylformamide or potassium carbonate in butanone. The alkylating agents of formula I or VII may be prepared from the corresponding phenols of fonnula V or IV respectively by treatment with a compounds L X L1 where L is a leaving group as previously described and L1 is the same or different leaving group, or is a group such as hydroxy group which may be converted into a leaving group by conventional methods in the presence of a hase in a suitable solvent as described above for the preparation of compounds of formula III . The phenols of formulae iv and V are either known compounds or may be prepared from known strting materials by methods analogous to th ose used for the preparation of the similar known phenols. For example, phenols of fromula IV in whichW represents the group E, ZE or OZ1 E where Z and Z1 are as previously described and E is a carboxylie ester group may be prepared using methods similar to that described by Carter and Lawrence, J. Chem. Soc. 77, 1226 1900 , or by esterification of the corresponding acids using standard conditions. The acids are either known or may be prepared from known starting materials by conventional methods for example by the Perkin synthesis as previously described for the preparation of compounds of formula I . Phenols of formula V in which RI is a hydrogen atom may, for example, be prepared according to the methods of R.A. Appleton et al J. Med. Chem., 20 371 1977 or W. Baker and O.M. Lothian in J. Chem. Soc., 628 1935 . It will be appreciated that some of the intermediates of general formula IV and VII may, if desired, be modified by eleetrophilic substitution using standard conditions, for example by nitration with a nitrating agent, such as concentrated nitric acid at low temperatures, or by bromination with a brominating agent, such as N bromoacetamide in a solvent such as dioxan at an elevated temperature. A compound of general formula in which the chain X is substituted by a hydroxy group may be obtained by reaction of a compound of general formula VIII or IX , EMI11.1 wherein D represents a hydrocarbon chain carrying an epoxide group, with a phenol of general formula IV or V respectively in a suitable solvent, for example dimethylformamide, in the presence of a catalyst such as trimethylbenzylammonium hydroxide at an elevated temperature. An epoxide of formula viii or IX may be obtained f,rom a phenol of formula V or IV respectively by treatment with an alkyl halide carrying an epoxide group, for example epichlorohydrin, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate and in a solvent such as butanone. Certain of the compounds of general formula I may be prepared from other compounds of general formula i . Thus for example compounds of formula I in whichY represents the group. ZA where Z is a C24 alkylene or C24 alkenylene chain may be prepared by catalytic hydrogellation of a corresponding compound of formula I where Z is a C2 alkenylene or C2 4 alkynylene chain. Conventional catalysts may be used, preferably palladium in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol such as methanol. A compound of general formula I in which Y represents the group A, ZA or OZ1A where A is a N 5 lH tetrazolyl carboxamide may be, prepared from the corresponding compounds of formula I in which A represents a carboxylic acid group using standard conditions, for example using 5 aminotetrazole and a coupling agent such a s N,N carbonyldiimidazole in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofura. It will be appreciated that certain of the reactions described above are capable of affecting other groups in the starting material which are desired in the end products care must therefore be take.n, in accordance with conventional practice either to perform reactions in a sequence which does not modify groups which are to be retained in the end products, or to ensure that such groups are in protected forms before the start of the reaction. This applies in particular to the preparation of the intermediates o,f formula III where it may be necessary to protect hydroxyl groups in starting materials IV and VII which are not involved in the alkylation reaction. The hydroxy groups may be protected as, for example, a benzyl ether or an acetate during the synthesis. The protecting group ,is removed when required either by catalytic hydrogenolysis or by hydrolysis as appropriate. A physiologically acceptable salt of a compound of general formula I may be prepared by standard techniques for example by treatment of the free acid of formula I with a base such as sodium hydroxide.
