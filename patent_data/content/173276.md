# METHOD FOR THE DETERMINATION OF SUBSTRATE OR ENZYME ACTIVITY

## Abstract
The determination of a substrate or an activity of an en zyme in a sample containing ammonia by using a reaction system which forms ammonia can be performed by decom posing ammonia in the sample with an ammonia decom posing reagent system, adding a reagent system necessary for the formation of ammonia from the substrate or the sub strate for the enzyme to form ammonia and determining the formed ammonia.
