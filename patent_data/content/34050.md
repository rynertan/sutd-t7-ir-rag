# Immunoassay of antigens.

## Abstract
In the immunoassay of antigens in liquids, a reaction mix ture is formed containing the liquid under assay, labelled anti gen, and a mixed binding reagent which contains an antigen binding site and a label binding site, the two sites be ing spaced apart in the reagent so that a single molecule of la belied antigen cannot bind to both sites. The label is one whose activity is changed upon binding to a label binding site, and the amount of antigen in the original liquid sample is deter mined by measuring the activity of the label in the reaction mix ture. A preferred label is a fluorophore. The mixed binding rea gent preferably consists of two antibodies linked together.
