# Drainage bag and non return valve assembly therefor.

## Abstract
A drainage bag employs a non return valve assembly including at least one baffle positioned between the top and bottom of the bag. Each baffle extends completely across the interior of the bag and includes an upper portion which is continuously attached to one face of the bag and a lower portion which is attached to an opposite face of the bag at spaced intervals so as to form at least one opening adapted to permit liquid to flow readily from the top of the bag to the bottom of the bag while inhibiting liquid from flowing from the bottom of the bag to the top of the bag.
