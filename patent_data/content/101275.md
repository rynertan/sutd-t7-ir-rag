# Fluid flow control valve and sealing gasket therefor.

## Abstract
A slurry valve includes a seat ring 40 slidable in the body and carrying a seal ring 42 on its forward face to seal against the surface of a valve ball or plug. Occupying the full space between the back 74 of the seat ring and an annular, radial surface 76 on the body, is an elastomeric gasket 46 which is generally rectangular in configuration but has corrugations across both annular faces. The gasket prevents entry of the slurry and, in addition, the total force of the line pressure is asserted against the inner cylindrical surface of the gasket and transmitted through the elastomeric material to be asserted against the opposing annular surfaces, though concentrated on the narrow sealing bands provided by the corrugated ridges. The invention also relates to the construc tion of the elastomeric gasket itself.
