## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN CHANGE SPEED GEAR MECHANISMS The present invention relates to change speed gear mechanisms and, more particularly, although not exclusively, to change speed gear mechanisms for use in the transmissions of motor vehicles. The present invention consists in a change speed gear mechanism characterized by a frusto conical or disclike rotary member having gear teeth disposed substantially parallel to the generatrix of the member, an input or output shaft rotatable relatively to the rotary member, an output or input gear fixed to the rotary member coaxially therewith so as to be rotatable with the member, a gear change unit mounted for rotation about an axis substantially parallel to the generatrix of the rotary member and comprising a series of gear cages arranged coaxially with respect to the axis of the change gear unit, said gear cages respectively including rings of gear teeth which rings are selectively expandable radially of the cages into mesh with the gear teeth on the rotary member so as to transmit rotation between the rotary member and a selected gear cage, and said rotary member and gear cages being adapted to provide different gear ratio connections when the.gear cages are respectively in mesh with the rotary member,and gear means coupling the change gear unit to the input or output shaft. In a preferred embodiment, the rotary member is a hollow, frusto conical rotary member having the gear teeth disposed about its internal conical surface substantially parallel to the generatrix thereof, aiid the gear change unit is mounted internally of the rotary member.The different gear ratios may be obtained by internally forming thc rotary member with a series of frustoconical sections respectively having increasing numbers of gear teeth from tlle innermost sections, which is adjacent the smaller diameter end of the rotary member, to the outermost section adjacent its larger diameter end.These sections cooperate respectively with the gear cages of the change gear unit, each of which cages has the same number of gear teeth. Alterllatively, the intenial conical surface of the rotary member may be formed with a single set of gear teeth which extend axially along the internal surface and taper along their lellZths so that they are wider adjacent the larder diameter end of the rotary member, and the gear cages cooperating with these tapered gear teeth are respectively provided with different numbers of gear teeth. The ring of gear teeth mounted in each cage may be expandable by a shuttle member which is slidable axially within the change gear unit and is controllable so as selectively to expand the teeth of the cages. Preferably, this shuttle is of such a length that it initially expands the teeth of one cage into mesh with the teeth of tulle rotary member before permittflig the teeth of the adjacent, previously engaged cage to disengage from the rotary member. The shuttle member may be colltrollable by a manually operable gear selector or an automatic gear selecting mechanism.The change speed gear mechanism according to the invention is particularly suitable for control by an automatic gear selecting mechanism because its design iiiherently requires successive engagement of consecutive gear ratios from low to high gear, as the speed of the output drive increases, and vice versa, as the speed of the output is reduced. Preferably, the input or output shaft is coupled to the inner end of the change gear unit and the output gear is disposed at or adjacent the outer periphery or larger diameter end of the rotary member, as the case may be. ln a motor vehicle, the input shaft may be coupled to the engine via a conventiorlal centrifugal or electromagnetic clutch mechanism and the output gear may be coupled to the propeller shaft of the vehicle via a conventional gear train iricliJding a reversing mecllm lism. Alternatively, the input shaft may be directly geared to a reversing drive which can be selectively engaged with the propeller shaft on disengagement of forward drive. In order that the present invention may be readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings in w1iicli Fig. 1 diagrammatically illustrates a motor vehicle gearbox embodying a change speed gear mechanism constructed in accordance with the invention, Fig. 2 is a fragmentary elevational view of tlie change gear unit, Fig. 3 is a section on the line Ill Ill of lig 2, Fig. 4 is a side view of one of the expandable teeth used in the gear cages, and Fig. 5 is a side view of the shuttle. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, the gearbox 1 has an input shaft 2 connected via a clutch mechanism 3 to the engine not shown of a motor vehicle, and an output shaft 4 connected to the propeller shaft not shown of the vehicle. It comprises a change speed gear mechanism 5 coupled to the input shaft 2 and a suitable gear train 7, including a reversing mechanism, coupling the change speed gear mechanism to the output shaft 4 of the gearbox. The change speed gear mechanism 5 comprises a hollow, frusto conical., rotary member or shell 6 supported at opposite ends on fixed end plates 8,9. The shell 6 is mounted on the end plates by means of rolling bearings 10,11. Its internal surface comprises a series of five frusto conical sections 12 16, each formed about its internal conical surface with gear teeth which extend axially of the conical surface. The numbers of gear teeth in tiie sections 12 16 increase successively from the smaller diameter end to the larger diameter end of the shell 6. The shell is connected at its larder diameter end to the input bevel gear 17 of the gear train 7 by a bevel gear ring 18 fastened to the larger diameter end of the shell. Mounted internally of the rotary member so as to cooperate with the gear sections 12 16 is a change gear unit 19. This unit is mounted for rotation about an axis parallel to the generatrix of the frustoconical shell by shafts 20,21 projecting from opposite ends of the unit and mounted in the fixed end plates 8,9 by means of rolling bearings 22,23. The gear unit comprises a series of five cylindrical gear cages 24 28 arranged coaxially with respect to the axis of the unit. Each gear cage comprises a ring of radially expandable teeth 29 which, when expantlcd, mesh with the teeth of the cooperating gear section 12 16 of the rotary shell. Referring to Figs. 2, 3 and 4, the expandable teeth 29 are slidably mounted in radial slots 30 in a cage body 31. At their inner ends they are formed with look portions 32 which are engaged by annular springs 33 which urge the teeth radially inwardly of their slots so that the teeth are biassed into a retracted position. The idler parts of the teeth are tapered at 31 so that, in their binerinost positions, the flanks of tiie tapered parts of the teeth engage to define a rest position and prevent further inward movement of the teeth.In this rest position, the inner edges 35 of the teeth define a central opening 36 substantially coaxial with an axial passageway 37 formed by the inner peripheries of the cages and extending through the change gear unit. Slidably mounted in tlie passageway 37 in the gear unit 19 is a shuttle 38 Fig. 5 for selectively actuating the rings of teeth 29 in the gear cages.This shuttle may be controlled ill any suitable manner by a manual gear selector or an automatic gear select ing mccliaiiism which slides the shuttle along the passageway so as to select the required gear ratio.The shuttle may be arranged to have a spring return.As shown in Fig, 5, it comprises a cylindrical body 39 having conically tapered end portions 40 for initially engaging the curved hook portions 32 at opposite ends of the teeth 29 as the shuttle is urged into each cage through the central opening 36 defined by the inner edges of the teeth. The tapered end portions 40 cam the teeth outwardly as the shuttle is moved into the opening 36 thereby radially to expand the ring of teeth into mesh with the cooperating toothed section 12 16 of the shell. When the teeth are fully expanded and in mesh with the cooperating toothed section of the shell, the shuttle is stationary and the idler edges 35 of the teeth rest on the cylindrical body part 39 of the shuttle.The shuttle is of such a length and design that, wllen the selector mechanism is actuated to move the shuttle from one gear cage and into engagement with an adjacent cage, tlie shuttle does not permit the teeth of said one cage fully to disengage from the shell until it has urged the teeth of the adjacent cage into mesh with its cooperating toothed section on the shell. This facilitates the changeover from one gear ratio to the next since at the instant of changeover the toothed sections are rotating at the same speed.As the adjacent cage teeth are expanded into mesh by the shuttle, the previously engaged cage teeth disengage and are retracted inwardly to their rest position under tlie action of the annular springs 32. The change gear unit 19 is driven by the input shaft 2. Th e shaft 2 projects into tlle interior of the shell 6 through the end plate 8 aiid is journalled in this end plate by a rolling bearing 41. It is coupled to t le unit 19 by a piiiion 42 fixed to its inner end and meslling witii a bevel gear 43 fixed to the shaft 20 of the unit 19. In operation, the shuttle 38 is normally urged into the position in which it engaCcs the gear cage providing tlie highest gear ratio cou ling, viz, the gear cage 2S adjacent the largest diameter end of tllC shell 6. Upon engaging the clutch 3, therefore, the engine is immediately coupled to drive the vehicle through the correct gear ratio for initiating motion of the vehicle, comnonly referred to as low gear.The drive is transmitted from the clutch 3 to the output shaft 4 of the gearbox via the input shaft 2, the meshing gears 42,43, the cage 28 meshing, with its cooperating toothed section 1 6 on tlte shell, the meshing bevel gears 1 S, 17 and the gear trail 7. As the vehicle accelerates, the selector mechanism can shift the shuttle 38 along the passageway 37 in the change gear unit 5 so as successively to engage the gear cages 27 21t and change the gear ratio of the coupling provided by the mechanism 5 in accordance with the desired speed of the vehicle.Conversely, when the vehicle slows down the selector mechanism can return the shuttle successively through the cages 24 28 to the lowest gear drive, which is provided by the cage 28 being in mesh with its cooperating toothed section 16 on the shell. Whilst a particular embodiment has been described, it will be understood that modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, it is an easy matter to change the number of toothed sections 12 16 on the shell G and gear cages 21z 2S of the change gear unit 19 so as to alter the number of gear ratios iich may be selected for driving the vehicle. In a modified version of the change speed gear mechanism, the frusto conical shell 6 is replaced by a disc having concentric rings of gear teeth disposed on one face thereof. The gear teeth extend radially of the disc and the number of teeth in each ring increases successively from the inner to the outer ring. The change gear unit, which may be constructed similarly to the unit 19, is mounted with its axis disposed radially and parallel to the toothed face of the disc with the gear cages arranged to cooperate respectively with the rings of teeth. The input or output shaft may be coupled to the change gear unit adjacent the centre of the disc and the output or input gear ring may be fixed to the disc adjacent its periphery. Such a mechanism operates in a similar manner to that described above to effect selective change in the gear ratio of the transmission.
