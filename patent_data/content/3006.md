## Abstract
A rock drill boom structure has a feed beam 32 mounted on one end of a boom 26 . The boom 26 is carried by a guide bushing 20 with which it forms a kelly joint. The guide bishing 20 is pivotably carried by a rotatable large diameter disc that is supported and guided at its periphery. The boom 14 can be withdrawn to extend rearwardly through a hole in the disc 19 .
