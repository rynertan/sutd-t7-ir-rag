# Improvements in staple couplings.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a staple coupling of the kind comprising interfitting male and female members for the connection of hose within a fluid system, sealing means 15 provided on at least one of the members to provide a fluid tight seal between the members and means to prevent separation of the members comprising external and internal grooves 33, 27 on the members respectively which register with one another when the members are engaged and holes 26 on the female member to receive a staple, the holes being positioned and arranged so that when the staple is inserted into the holes the staple engages the registering grooves on the members to prevent separation of the members, in which at least one of the staple, the grooves and the holes to receive the staple is shaped so as to allow limited axial movement of the two coupling members in a separating direction to a locked position when the staple is fully inserted whereby the staple cannot be removed until the members are moved back to their unlocked position, means being provided to urge the members to the locked position in use.
