# Transistor driver circuit.

## Abstract
The circuit rapidly charges and discharges a load capacitor by sensing the direction of transients at an internal node 12 of the circuit which is selectively isolated from a capacitive output node 26 to produce significant load current during upward transients. In an embodiment of the invention, the circuit includes a driver device 10 and first 18 , second 24 and third 30 field effect tran sistors. The first transistor 18 is connected between a voltage supply terminal 20 and the driver device 10 forming an internal node 12 and acts as a current source pulling up the internal node. The second transistor 18 is connected between the internal node 12 and an output node 26 and is arranged to selectively isolate the inter nal node from the output node, with isolation increasing during a positive transient to allow maximum drive to the third transistor connected between the voltage supply terminal and the output node to produce increased output current. The second transistor 26 is also arranged to minimize the isolation between the internal and output nodes 12, 26 during negative transients to rapidly dis charge the output node.
