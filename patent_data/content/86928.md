# Imaging X ray spectrometer.

## Abstract
An X ray spectrometer for providing imaging and ener gy resolution of an X ray source comprised of a thick silicon wafer 10 having an embedded matrix or grid of aluminum completely through the wafer fabricated, for example, by thermal migration. The aluminum matrix defines the walls 16, 18 of a rectangular array of silicon X ray detector cells 14 or pixels . A thermally diffused aluminum electrode 20 is also formed centrally through each of the silicon cells 14 with biasing means 22, 26, 28 being connected to the aluminum cell walls 16, 18 and the centralized aluminum electrode 20 for causing lateral charge carrier depletion between the cell walls so that incident X ray energy causes a photoelectric reaction within the silicon producing collectible charge carriers in the form of electrons which are collected and used for imaging.
