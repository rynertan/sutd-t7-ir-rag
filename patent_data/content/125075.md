# TAGGING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A tagging apparatus for inserting labeling tags into gar ments has a conventional manual tagging gun 65 mounted on a carrier 62 for vertical movement by a pneumatic ram 64 such that the tagging needle may be projected through or with drawn from an aperture 61 in a work table 60. A bracket 67,68 serves to operate the gun trigger to effect tagging as the gun is advanced to project the needle. A shield bar 72 is disposed over the work table 60, there being a recess 73 to receive the projecting tagging needle. The bar 72 is movable vertically by means of a double acting pneumatic ram 70 so that bulky items may be placed on the work table, compressed by the bar and then tagged by the gun.
