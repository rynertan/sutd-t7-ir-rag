# Improvements in and relating to breathing apparatus.

## Abstract
A power assisted respirator comprises a facepiece 1 for covering at least the nose and mouth of the wearer which has an outlet provided with a one way exhale valve 2 which is openable to permit air to flow out of the facepiece when a predetermined pressure P is established within the facepiece. A pump unit 5 supplies air to the space within the facepiece. The pump unit 5 may be connected to an inlet of the facepiece by a flexible hose 4 or may be mounted directly on or in the facepiece. A filter canister 11 is connected to the inlet 10 of the pump means for filtering air supplied to the facepiece. A one way inlet valve 13 or 16 is provided in the path of air flowing from the pump unit to the facepiece and a pressure sensor 12 is provided for sensing the pressure of air in the region of the pump unit inlet for causing deenergisation of the pump unit when the pressure in the region of the pump unit inlet exceeds a predetermined level. The operating parameters of the pump of the pump unit and the exhale valve are selected so that the pressure within the facepiece at which the exhale valve will open slightly exceeds the pressure at the outlet of the pump which will cause the pump to cease or substantially cease operating effectively. Thus in use, during exhalation the pressure within the facepiece will rise to a level at which the inlet valve 13 or 16 will close causing a build up of pressure at the pump outlet which will cause the pump to cease operating effectively. Meantime the exhale valve will open. During normal operation of the pump, because of the resistance to flow provided by the filter canister, the pressure in the region of the pump inlet will be sub atmospheric. The pressure sensor 12 is arranged to sense a rise in this pressure resulting from the pump ceasing or substantially ceasing to operate effectively and will cause deenergisation of the pump. The reduction in pressure within the facepiece at the start of inhalation, which is communi cated to the pump, is sensed by the pressure sensor 12 which then causes reenergisation of the pump.
