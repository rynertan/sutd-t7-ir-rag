# A vehicle hoist.

## Abstract
A vehicle hoist has an inclined column 23 along which a carriage 45 having normally horizontal support members is moved. The carriage is moved by a hydraulic cylinder and engages the column in a ratchet like fashion allowing upwards movement but preventing the lowering of the carriage unless a release mechanism is actuated simul taneously with the hydraulic valve governing the cylinder. The construction provides smooth surfaces about the column.
