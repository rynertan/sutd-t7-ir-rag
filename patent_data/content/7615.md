R is an alkyl, substituted alkyl or alkenyl group. Preferred R substitutents are selected from the group consisting of EMI2.4 EMI3.1 Especially preferred R groups areEMI3.2 R1 is a lower C1 C8, alkyl group, such as octyl, hexyl, pentyl, isopropyl, ethyl or methyl.Preferred R1 groups are C1 C6 alkyl. A most preferred R1 group is methyl. R2 is the residue of an aldehyde formulaR2 CHO, having no a hydrogen, where R2 is a phenyl or substituted phenyl group wherein the substituents are halo Cl, Br or I C1 C3 alkyl or NO2. Examples of specific R2 groups are phenyl, p chlorophenyl, 4 nitrophenyl, 4 isopropylphenyl and the like. A preferred Rê group is phenyl. R is an alkyl, alkenyl or substituted alkyl group which is the same as or readily convertible to the R group. Readily convertibleR3 groups are R groups which bear OH groups and are protected. Examples of such protected moieties areEMI4.1 Z is H, lower alkyl e.g. CH3 or butyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl e.g. p CH3 phenyl. A preferred Z group is phenyl. R4is an alkyl, substituted alkyl or aryl sulfonyl group such as p toluenesulfonyl, benzenesulfonyl, nitrophenylsulfonyl, chloraphenylsulfonyl, hexylsuifonyl, and the like. X is halo e.g. Br, C1 or I. Chloro is preferred. R5 is a C, C5 alkyl group e.g. CH3, pentyl or isopropyl an aryl group such as phenyl, bromophenyl, p totyl, xylyl and the.like . an ararkyl group such as benzyl and the like. A preferred R5 group is the C1 C5 arkyl moiety, expecially methyl. The process of the present invention is illustrated by the following reaction equation sequence when Ph is phenyl EMI5.1 EMI6.1 The Schiff,basp a is conveniently prepared from 6 chloro a amino butyric methyl ester hydrochloride using the process described Helv. Chem Acta 40, 1531 1957 . The strong base in Step A may be a suitable lithium dialkylamide. Examples of such bases are lithium diisopropylamide, lithium dimethylamide, lithium dicyclohexylamide and the like and lithium hexamethyldisilazide. A preferred base is lithium hexamethyldisilazide. The liquid reaction medium used for step A is preferably an aprotic medium such as hexamethylphospharamide HMPA m tetrahydrofuran THF , ethyl ether 1.4 dioxane and the like.A preferred medium is HMPA and THF. Step A is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 700C to about room temperature. Intermediate b amine is not ordinarily isolated and step B is carried out on directly on the step A reaction product. In step B, the b is treated with an appropriate alkylating agent as defined above.The alkylating agent is added directly to the reaction product b in said liquid reaction medium. Step B is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 700C to room temperature. The CH R2 amine blocking group is removed from reaction product c using conventional technology e.g. by passing the reaction product through a column of acidified silica gel. The ester d is then hydrolyzed using as suitable inorganic acid to produce the final product e as the acid salt. The hydrolysis step also serves to remove any other blocking groups, e.g., the hydroxyl blocking group present in the R3 moiety. The final product e may be converted to the free base by conventional neutralization.
