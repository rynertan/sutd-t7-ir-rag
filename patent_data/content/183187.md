# Method of increasing the productivity of reversing plate mills.

## Abstract
A method of improving the productivity and yield of a reversing plate mill comprises installing coiler furnaces on the upstream and downstream sides of the mill. Thereafter, a supply of extra large slabs as well as a supply of pattern slabs for the mill are provided. The plate requirements for the next horizon period are analyzed and for each size plate, a decision is made i to process extra large size slabs, or ii to process pattern slabs, or iii a combination of both extra large and pattern slabs to supply the plate requirements. The slabs are then processed in accordance with the particular decision.
