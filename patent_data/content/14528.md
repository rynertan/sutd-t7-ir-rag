# A method of reducing the colour of diamond.

## Abstract
A method of reducing diamond of type 1b including the steps of exposing the diamond to irradiation capable of caus ing atomic displacements in the diamond, for example the irradiation may be electron bombardment of energy greater than 300KeV, followed by heat treating the irradiated diamond at a temperature in the range 1600 C to 2200 C under a pressure at which the diamond is crystallographically stable at the temperature used.
