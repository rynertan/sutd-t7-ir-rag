# Multiple output switching power supply.

## Abstract
Multiple output switching power supply, where voltage at a main output coupled to a main secondary winding of a transformer is regulated by pulse width modulation of the current flowing in the primary winding of the transformer and where the voltage at an auxiliary output coupled to an auxiliary secondary winding of the transformer is regulated by pulse width modulation of the current flowing in the auxiliary winding. Pulse width modulation is performed in synchronism with a preestablished turn on delay of the switches which control current pulses in the primary winding as to the turn on of the switches which control current pulses in the auxiliary winding. Beside avoiding the need of a filter between the auxiliary winding and the related control switch, this form of synchro nization allows for reduction of switching power losses, current spikes, induced radio frequency emission.
