## Description
TRIPLE STATE CIRCUITFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to triple state circuits in general and in particular to a triple state programmable signal amplitude buffer circuit with override control.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A conventional triple state circuit comprises an input data line, an data output line and a control line. In operation, a logical high and a logidal low on the input data line and a suitable control signal on the control line will produce a logical high, a logical low and a high output impedance on the data output line, respectively. In the context of a triple state circuit, a high input or output impedance is considered to be, ideally. an infinite impedance or at least, an impedance of sufficient magnitude to result in negligible current drain from circuits coupled to the high impedance lines. As solid state circuit designs have evolved, certain types of circuits have become standard in the industry, such as for example, TTL and ECL circuits. TTL circuits are characterized in that they respond to and output signals comprising a logical high ot 5 volts and a logical low of O volts. ECL circuits are characterized in that they respond to and output signals comprising a logical high of 0.8 volts and a logical low or 1.6 volts. Other circuits which have or are becoming standards in the industry respond to and output logical high and low signals having different magnitudes. A number of disadvantages are encountered in using conventional triple state circuits as described above. One disadvantage is that no provision is made in conventional triple state circuits for providing a high output impedance on the output data line in response to a high input impedance or open circuit in series with the input data line. In all cases, a control signal must be applied to the control line in order to provide a high output impedance on the data output line. Another disadvantage is that a conventional triplestate circuit which is designed to respond to a specific type of signal, such as a TTL or an ECL signal, will only provide the same type of signal on its data output line.There is usually no provision for changing the magnitude of the logical high and low data output signals independently of the magnitude of the logical high and low data input signals. Still another disadvantage of the conventional triplestate circuits is that none provide a means for using the circuits alone or with other types of circuits to coupleTTL, ECL, other digital signals, as well as analog signals, each having different high and low peak amplitudes, to the same data signal bus. In all cases, conventional triplestate circuits restrict the type of signal which can be coupled to a given data bus to a specific type of signal, e.g. TTL, ECL, or the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing, a principle object of the present invention is a novel triple state circuit which comprises features for eliminating certain of the disadvantages of prior known triple state circuits described above. Among the features of a circuit according to the present invention, there is provided a means responsive to a logical high data signal, a logical low data signal and a high input impedance on an data input line for providing logical high and logical low data signals and a high output impedance on an data output line, respectively. Another feature of a circuit according to the present invention is a means for changing the magnitude of logical high and low data signals provided on an data output line independently of the magnitude of logical high and low data signals applied to the data input line. Another feature of a circuit according to the present invention is a means which permits a plurality of data signals from different signal sources to be coupled to a single data bus even though the positive and negative peak amplitudes of the signals may be different or exceed the reference voltages used in the triple state circuits coupled to the data bus. Another feature of a circuit according to the present invention is a means for providing a high output impedance on the data output line of the circuit independently of the magnitude of the input data signals applied or the output impedance of the ouput of a circuit coupled to the data input line thereof. Still another feature of the present invention is that all transistors in the circuit are operated in a nonsaturated mode. Because all of the transistors in the circuit are operated in a nonsaturated mode, fast transient times and short propagation delays can be achieved.

The anode of diode D5 is coupled to the collector of Q5 and the cathode of diode D5 is coupled through an 890 ohm resistor R5 to the 8 volt supply by means of the line 81. The emitter of Q5 is coupled to the anode of a diode D8 and through a diode D7 to the emitter of transistor Q2.The emitter of Q2 is also coupled through a 590 ohm resistor R7 to the 8 volt supply by means of the line 80. The cathode of the diode D8 is coupled to ground through a diode D9 which is coupled in parallel with a pair of series connected diodes D10 and D11 and through a 440 ohm resistor R10 to the 8 volt supply by means of the line 81. In the following description of the operation of circuit 1, it is assumed that each of the diodes in circuit 1, except diode D6, has a forward voltage drop of .5 volts, that all of the transistors in circuit 1 are operated in a nonsaturated mode and that the forward emitter to base PNP and base to emitter NPN voltage drops are .5 volts.Diode D6 a hot carrier diode , which acts as a Baker clamp, is assumed to have a forward voltage drop of .4 volts. Because all of the transitors in the circuit are operated in a nonsaturated mode, fast transient times and short propagation delays can be obtained. Thus, in operation, with a 5 volt signal applied to the over ride control line 61, transistor Q5 is conducting, i.e. is on. With Q5 on, the potential on a node A between the emitter of Q1 and the cathode of diode D5 is 0.6 volts. With 0.6 volts on the emitter of Q1, a 5 volt TTL signal, i.e. a logical high signal, on the data input line 70 coupled to the base of Qi will cause Q1 to turn on. WhenQ1 turns on, a positive constant current of approximately 8 milliamps is caused to flow on the line 45 from the positive constant current source 42 to the negative current source 44 turning on transistor Q6. When Q6 is turned on and with the high reference voltage on line 84 having a magnitude of 10 volts, a potential of 8.5 volts is caused to appear on a node B between the cathode of diode D19 and the collector of Q6. With a potential of 8.5 volts on node B, the diode drop or D19 causes the potential on the line 51 to be 9 volts. It should be noted that the potential on line 51 will always be equal to the high reference voltage minus 1 volt when it reaches its quiescent state due to the diode drops in the output stage 116. Consequently, to change the magnitude of the signal on the output line 50, all that is required is to change the magnitude of the positive or high reference voltage applied to the line 84. Referring to the operation of the low signal leg of the circuit 1, with Q5 turned on, a bias potential of 1.5 volts appears on a node C between the anode of the diode D7 and the emitter of Q2. Under these conditions, when the TTL signal on the input line 70 goes from a logical high of 5 volts to a logical low of 0 volts, Q1 turns off and Q2 turns on. When Q2 turns on, a negative constant current of approximately 8 milliamps is caused to flow in the line 55 turning on Q7 in the positive constant current source 54.When Q7 turns on, Q9 in the output stage 56 is turned on causing a 9 volt potential to appear on the line 58. It will be noted that while the potential on line 51 due to the turning on of the transistor Q8 in the output stage 46 is always 1 volt less than the high reference potential when it reaches its quiescent state, the potential on line 58 due to the turning on of the transistor Q9 in the output stage 56 is always 1 volt more than the low reference potential when it reaches its quiescent state. Also, as described above with respect to the output stage 46, to change the magnitude of the potential on the line 58, all that is required is to change the magnitude of the low reference voltage applied to the line 85.Consequently, if a TTL output signal is desired on the lines 51 and 58, the high reference potential applied to line 84 should be 6 volts and the low reference potential applied to line 85 should be 1 volts for a 5 and 0 volt output signal, respectively. If an ECL output signal is desired on the lines 51 and 58, the high reference potential applied to line 84 should be 1.8 volts and the low reference potential applied to line 85 should be 2.6 volts for a .6 and a 1.8 volt output signal, respectively. Of course, the magnitudes of the high and low reference potentials may be any desired magnitude suitable for a particular application. When the source of the data signals applied to the data input line 70 is a triple state circuit or other circuit which can be operated so as to provide a high output impedance to the line 70, both input transistors Q1 and Q2 will be turned off causing both of the transistorsQ8 and Q9 in the output stages 46 and 56 to be turned off.When both Q8 and Q9 are turned off, the output impedance on the data output line 50 is high. Under certain circumstances, it is desirable to cause the circuit 1 to have a high output impedance on the line 50 regardless of the data signals applied to or the magnitude of the impedance on the data input line 70. Under such circumstances, a signal, e.g. 0 volts, is applied to the over ride control line 61 to turn off transistor Q5.When transistor Q5 is turned off, the potential on node A is equal to or greater than 5 volts, as determined by the magnitudes of the resistors R8 and R5, and the potential on node C is 0 volts, as determined by the diodes D7,D8,D10 and D11 and resistor R10. With the aforementioned potentials on nodes A and C, both transistors Q1 and Q2 will be held off. They will be held off because the conventional logical high of a TTL input signal does not exceed 5 volts and the logical low of a TTL input signal does not go below 0 volts. Consequently, the circuit 1 can be caused to have a high output impedance on the data output line 50, regardless of the signal applied to the data input line 70. Another important feature of the present invention is the fact that when the output impedance of the circuit 1 is high, potentials can be applied to the data output line 50 which are greater ehan and less than the high and low reference potentials applied to the lines 84 and 85, respectively. Indeed, the only limitation on the magnitudes of the potentials which can be applied to the data output line 50 when the circuit 1 is providing a high output impedance is the breakdown voltage of the transistorsQ6,Q7,Q8 and Q9 and the diodes D16,D18,D19,D20,D21 and D23.The element in the circuit 1 which provides this feature is the diode D18 in the output stage 46 and the diode 23 in the output stage 56. Thus, in operation, it can be seen that if a potential exceeding 10 volts is applied to the line 51, the diodesD18 and D16 will be reverse biased. Similarly, if a potential of less than 10 volts is applied to the line 58, the diodes D23 and D21 will be reversed biased. While a preferred embodiment of the present invention is described above and several alternative arrangements, reference potentials, and the like, have been suggested, it is contemplated that still other modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of the invention not be limited to the embodiments described, but, rather, that it be determined by reference to the claims hereinafter provided.
