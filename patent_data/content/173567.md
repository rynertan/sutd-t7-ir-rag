## Description
METHOD OF TREATING TEETH WITH CERTAIN PHOTOPOLYMERIZABLECOMPOSITIONS INCLUDING CATALYST COMPRISING ANACYLPHOSPHINE OXIDEThe invention relates to a method of treating teeth with a photopolymerizable composition including at least one olefinically unsaturated compound and a photosensitive catalyst containing an acylphosphine oxide.Background of the InventionThe use of photopolymerizable compositions for end use applications such as pit and fissure sealants, bonding agents, and dental composites is of commercial interest because such compositions can be marketed as one package systems and therefore do not need to be mixed at the point of use such as is the case with the usual peroxide curable composition which must be mixed with an activator just before use.This invention is directed to a method of treating teeth with a photopolymerizable dental restorative composition containing an acylphosphine oxide catalyst system that is highly effective when employed in conjunction with visible light, and which exhibits rapid cure rate and excellent properties after cure.Heretofore, the best photopolymerizable dental compositions known to the inventor herein employ a catalyst system including a mixture of camphoroquinone and benzil.The acylphosphine oxide catalyst system of this invention provides ultimate properties similar to those which can be obtained by the camphoroquinone benzil system, but with the added desireable feature of providing an optically clear resin as opposed to the light orange yellow resin obtained with the camphoroquinone benzil system. TWis an advantage in the development of dental compositions having optimum cosmetic properties.Brief Summary of the InventionThe invention provides a composition comprising at least one olefinically unsaturated compound and a catalyst comprising an acylphosphine oxide for treating teeth by its application to a prepared tooth.The Prior ArtPhotopolymerizable dental compositions are known. For instance, they are described in Dart et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,071,424, in Schmitt et al., U.S. Patent No.4,189,365, Jochum et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,351,853,Orlowski et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,427,799, Kemper,U.S. Patent No. 4,261,879, and Kumar, U.S. PatentNo 4,500,657, and in published European application Nows.

Detailed Descr4yion of the InventionThe photopolymerizable dental composition used in the invention includes at least one olefinically unsaturated compound. Such materials are known in the art, and need to be illustrated by only a few examples. It is preferred that the olefinically unsaturated compound be an acrylic or methacrylic ester, and particularly, a compound having two or more acrylic or methacrylic ester groups because the polyfunctional acrylic esters exhibit less shrinkage upon polymerization than do the monofunctional acrylic esters, and also provide cross linking.Specific types of acrylic esters that are useful include alkane diol acrylates or methacrylates such as the C4 C12 alkane diol acrylates or methacrylates, e.g., l,10 decamethylene diol dimethacrylate and 1,6 hexamethylene diol dimethacrylate the polyalkylene glycol acrylates or methacrylates, such as triethylene glycol dimethacrylate and tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate bisphenol A acrylate or methacrylate esters alkoxylated bisphenol A acrylate or methacrylate, e.g., ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate bisphenol A diglycidyl dimethacrylate Bis GMA and the like. Other multifunctional acrylic or methacrylic esters that can be used include methacrylate terminated polyurethanes, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate or triacrylate, and the like.In certain preferred aspects of the invention, a monofunctional monomer i.e., a monomer containing only one olefinically unsaturated group is used in conjunction with the monomer containing two or more olefinically unsaturated groups. Preferred monofunctional monomers include benzyl methacrylate and 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexyl methacrylate. When used, the monofunctional monomer is preferably used in amounts of from about 5 to about 40 weight per cent of the monomer portion of the formulation.The composition of the invention may contain fillers such as silica, powdered glass, powdered quartz, or the like, which are conventional in the art.For composite applications, the filler preferably has a volume average particle size below 15 microns, and preferably, below 5 microns. Thirty per cent of the filler particles, and preferably 70 to 100 per cent, have a size below 5 microns. The filler is preferably employed in an amount within the range of from about 35 to about 78 volume per cent, based on the volume of the filler plus the polymerizable composition. Thus, the filler is preferably employed in relatively high proportions. A volume per cent of 35 to 78 corresponds approximately to 50 to 95 weight per cent of the dental restorative composition of the invention, depending on the specific gravity of the filler.For composite applications, it is preferable to use hydrophobic, chemically durable fillers such as quartz andor a particular heat treated barium or strontium glass. Such hydophobic fillers will absorb less than 0.1 weight per cent water prior to addition of silane coupling agent when exposed to normal ambient conditions.Water content of the filler is determined by a differential scanning calorimeter DSC . The first departure from baseline in a DSC scan is caused by the presence of water. To determine the amount present, the area under the peak is determined and normalized relative to the weight of the sample. The barium or strontium glass that may be employed as the filler is selected for chemical durability, as is evidenced by resistance to leaching in an aqueous environment. Such glasses are substantially free of alkali metal oxides, and are single phase glasses. If the mole per cent of barium or strontium oxide exceeds a certain point, the glass becomes two phased. This proportion can vary, depending upon the presence and proportion of other metal oxides in the glass. For one preferred type of glass that is composed of oxides of barium, silicon, boron, and aluminum, the upper limit for a single phase glass is about 20 mole per cent barium oxide.One preferred glass for use in the invention has the following composition Sio2 67 mole per cent BaO 16.4 mole per cent B203 10 mole per cent A1203 6.6 mole per centThe essential ingredients in the glass are the oxides of barium and or strontium and silicon. Oxides of other metals such as aluminum and boron may also be present so long as such oxides do not detract from the chemical durability of the glass. Thus, significant quantities of alkali metal oxides should be avoided because, as is well known, alkali metal ions are quite soluble in aqueous media, and therefore will reduce the chemical durability of the glass. The minimum barium and or strontium content of the glass is preferably that which is sufficient to impart X ray opacity to the glass. The preferred barium and or strontium glass powder is acid washed and then subjected to a heat treatment to enhance its resistance to attack by water. The procedures are the following The acid washing treatment to which the glass powder is subjected is carried out by known procedures. For instance, a mixture of 1 part by weight of glass powder, 1 part of 37 per cent aqueous hydrochloric acid, and 1 part of de ionized water is stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes, filtered, and rinsed with de ionized water until the pH of the filtrate is the same as the rinse water. The powder is then dried at about 500C. overnight in a forced air oven. The acid wash is used to remove metal impurities from the glass and to reduce the amount of leachable barium or strontium from the surface of the glass.The acid washed glass powder is subjected to a heat treatment to reduce the affinity of the glass powder for water. This heat treatment is carried out at an elevated temperature below the sintering temperature of the glass powder the sintering temperature can be determined by known procedures, as by thermo mechanical analysis 1gTMA , but high enough to cause a significant reduction in the specific surface area of the glass powder, as measured by known procedures such as by a Quantasorb B.E.T. surface area analyzer. The reduction in specific surface area will usually be at least 50 per cent i.e., the surface area of the heat treated glass powder will be less than about one half that of the untreated powder , up to 80 to 90 per cent, or even more in some cases.The heat treat ment time is not at all critical in that it need be carried out only for the minimum time needed to heat all the powder to the desired temperature. Apparently the effect of the heat on the glass powder is quite rapid, and all that is required is to bring all of the mass of powder up to the desired temperature. However, since the glass powder is an excellent heat insulator, this can take several hours for masses of powder wherein the heat must travel through a significant thickness of powder to heat all of the glass to the desired temperature.As is known in the art, a silane coupling agent can be employed to enhance the bond between the filler and the resin. Such coupling agents include gamma methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane.In many cases, such as in composite formulations, it is desirable to include a small percentage of colloidal silica in the composition in order to adjust the viscosity and the handling characteristics of the paste. For instance, from about 2 to about 25 weight per cent of colloidal silica, based on weight of the entire composite, is beneficial.The colloidal silica is preferably treated with a silane coupling agent such as gamma methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilicone A 174 . After such treatment, the silica should be protected from ambient moisture because it may absorb up to about 1 weight per cent of water from the atmosphere, as measured by DSC.The major novelty of the invention is the use of an acylphosphine oxide as the photosensitizing catalyst. The acylphosphine oxides employed in the invention can be represented by Formula I R 2 P O CO R1 I wherein each R individually is a hydrocarbyl group such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, which can be halo , alkyl , or alkoxy substituted, or the two R groups can be joined to form a ring along with the phosphorus atom, and wherein R1 is a hydrocarbyl group, an S, o, or N containing five or six membered heterocyclic group, or the group Z CO P O R 2 wherein each R individually has the meaning set forth above, and wherein Z represents a divalent hydrocarbyl group such as alkylene or phenylene of from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.Usually the R groups will have from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and the Rl group will have from 2 to 18 carbon atoms.The acylphospine oxides employed in the invention can be produced by reacting an acid halide of the formula RI CO X tri wherein R1 is as described above and wherein X representsCl or Br, with a phosphite of the formula R 2 P OR2 III wherein each R individually is as described above, and wherein R2 is a hydrocarbon group such as C1 to C6 alkyl or cycloabkyl of from 5 to 6 carbon atoms. A detailed description of the process for making the acylphosphine oxides is found in Besse et al., U.S. PatentNo. 4,265,723, referred to above.The preferred acylphosphine oxides for use in the invention are those in which the R variables are phenyl or lower alkyl or lower alkoxy substituted phenyl, and wherein R1 is phenyl or lower alkyl or lower alkoxysubstituted phenyl By lower alkyl and lower alkoxy is meant such groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The preferred acylphosphine oxide is 2,4,6 trimethyl benzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide.It is preferable to employ the acylphosphine oxide in cambînation with a tertiary amine reducing agent. Illustrative tertiary amines include ethyl 4 N,N dimethylamino benzoate and N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. The catalysts are employed in catalytically effective amounts, such as from about 0.1 to about 5 weight per cent based on weight of olefinically unsaturated compound of the acylphosphine oxide plus from about 0.1 to about 5 weight per cent again, based on the weight of the olefinically unsaturated compound of the tertiary amine.The catalyst system is activated by exposure to light of a wave length of from about 250 nm to about 700 nm. Preferably, the wave length is in the visible light region about 380 nm to 550 nm . The visible light sources ordinarily used for visible light cured dental composites can be used with this catalyst system. The examples below illustrate one such light source and the conditions under which it is used.The examples set forth below illustrate photopolymerizable compositions used in the invention. The following monomers were used in the Examples Ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate EBDM Triethylene glycol dimethacrylate TEGDM 1,6 hexamethylene glycol dimethacrylate HXDDM 2,2 propane bis 3 4 phenoxy 2 hydroxypropyl l methacrylate Bis GMA Benzyl methacrylate BMA In the Examples and Control Examples, the ingredients were mixed, de gassed to insure bubble free cured copositions, and cured by exposure to a commecial light source for photoinitiated reactions. For the samples without filler, the ingredients were simply mixed and de gassed in a vacuum oven at room temperature for about 30 minutes, and were then exposed to a Translux commercial light source for 40 seconds. The distance between the source and the sample was about 0.5 to 1 inch.The samples were held in a glass bottomed Teflon mold 2.5 millimeters deep during exposure to the light, and were aged at 370C. in water for 24 hours before testing. For the samples that contained filler, the ingredients were mixed at room temperature and were vacuum degassed in a vacuum oven at room temperature for about 30 minutes, and were cured by exposure of both sides to a Translux or Fotofil commercial light source for 60 seconds, with the sample being held 4 to 5 inches away from the source. The Teflon mold was used, with glass slides on both the top and bottom.
