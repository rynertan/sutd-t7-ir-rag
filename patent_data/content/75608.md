Further features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following specification taken in connection with the drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a filter apparatus in accordance with the invention and Figure 2 is a partly in section schematic representation of a foraminous body employed in the apparatus of Figure 1. In Figure 1 thr is schematically depicted an apparatus in accordance with the present invention generally designated by the reference numeral 10. The apparatus 10 comprises in cooperative combination a conduit or channel defining means 11. The conduit 11 has a vertically extending leg or means to indicate pressure drop 12 open to the atmosphere and an enlarged, filter bed containing portion 13. The conduit 11 contains an aqueous stream 14 flowing in the direction indicated by the arrows. The stream 14 contains preferably less than 1000 parts by weight of an oil or organic compound per million parts by volume of water.The conduit 11 has a discharge portion 15 remotely disposed from the leg 12 and disposed adjacent to the enlarged portion 13. A plurality of foraminous filter elements 17 are disposed within the enlarged portion 13 of the conduit 11 and are in generally sealing relationship with the adjacent portions of the enlarged portion 13 of the conduit 11. Adjacent the leg 12 is a foraminous filter bed retaining means 18 such as a metal screen.A second retaining means 19 is disposed generally adjacent the discharge end 15. The foraminous filter elements 17, as depicted in Figure 1, are of generally planar discoidal configuration and permit the flow of water therethrough.Each of the foraminous elements 17 has a surface coating not shown of an oil imbibing latex, the oil imbibing latex being oil swellable and oil insoluble, the coating being swellable from 2 to 50 times the volume of the unswollen coating In Figure 2 there is schematically depicted a fractional sectional view of a filter element 25.The filter element 25 comprises a foraminous body 26 having a plurality of ccll al1s 27 and a plurality of interstitial spaces 28. The element 25 comprises a foraminous substrate 29 which is generally water insoluble. The substrate 29 has disposed on the surface thereof an oil imbibing coating 31. The oil imbibing coating 31 is an oil swellable latex coating having the hereinbefore described oil swelling characteristics. In operation of the apparatus and practice of the method of the invention, an aqueous stream containing small quantities of oil is passed into conduit 11 as indicated by the arrow in Figure 1.The aqueous stream passes through the filter elements 17 and is discharged from the discharge portion of the conduit 15. Small quantitites of oil within the stream are imbibed by the latex coating such as the coating 31.The coating 31, as oil is added thereto, swells to form a plurality of swollen latex particles which agglomerate into viscous blobs which are carried downstream in the filter elements 17 and contact unswollen coating which removes the portion of the oil from the generally highly swollen particles in contact therewith to form blobs or globs of viscous agglomerated oil swollen latex particles which reach a size sufficient to cause plugging of the filter, that is, the interstitial spaces are plugged sufficiently to prevent flow of the aqueous stream therethrough. As the filter elements 17 become plugged, the level of the stream rises in the leg 12 until a predetermined head is obtained and the stream end is shut off or diverted to another like filter and the filter elements 17 replaced with elements having an unswollen latex coating.In the practice of the present invention, a wide variety of materials may be employed as a substrate to support the oil imbibing latex elating. terils which are particularly desirable are flexible synthetic resinous foams such as, for example, open cell polyurethane foams, open cell polyolefin foams such as polyethylene foams, polypropylene foams, polybutene foams, polyvinylchloride foams, polybutadiene foams, polyisoprene foams and other rubber foams. Other materials useful as a substrate for coating with the oil imbibimg latex include, for example, sand, vermiculite, bagasse, straw, sawdust, granular petroleum and wood charcoals, cokes, ground automobile and truck tires, metal shot, glass beads and glass foams. Also suitable as substrates are fibrous bodies which employ natural or synthetic fibers in woven or nonwoven configuration. For many applications, it is desirable that the substrate be unaffected by the oil or organic liquid contained within the aqueous stream. This is particularly true where such sorbent beds will have a relatively long exposure to a comtaminated aqueous stream. However, for many applications, a substrate may be employed which is slowly attacked by the organic material within the aqueous stream.Typical of such applications are filters in which the pressure drop across them is continuously monitored and replacement is made rapidly when the filter has been plugged. It is generally essential that the rate of swelling of the latex polymer coating be substantially greater than the rate of swelling or dissolving of the substrate. For applications wherein an organic liquid sensitive substrate is employed, generally it is desirable that the swellable latex polymer swell at least twice the rate at which the substrate swells or dissolves. Latex polymers useful in the practice of the present invention are latexes of any polymers which swell on contact with oils. Useful latex polymers may swell on contact with water. However, additional swelling must occur when contacted with the oil or organic material to be removed. Selection of a polymer for use with any oil or organic liquid is readily accomplished by determining a swelling index for the latex polymer particles in the particular liquid to be soaked or imbibed. Beneficially, such a swelling index is readily determined by immersing a latex polymer in the desired oil or organic liquid and determining the volume per unit weight of latex polymer after a period of 30 minutes with water and oil. The ratio of the volume per unit weight with organic liquid and without the oil or organic liquid provides the swelling index.If the polymer is soluble, the swelling index is infinite. If the swelling index is greater than 1.2, the polymer particles are useful in the practice of the present invention. Beneficially, for most applications, a swelling index of at least 1.5 and preferably greater than 3 is desirable. It is critical to the practice of the present invention to employ a crosslinked polymer which swells but does not dissolve. If the polymer swells in the presence of the organic liquid and water, it is suitable for the practice of the present invention However, for most applications, it is desirable to employ a polymer which is crosslinked to a sufficient degree that it exhibits a swelling index between 1.5 and 50 and preferably between 3 and 50. A wide variety of polymeric materials are employed with benefit.Such polymers include polymers of styrenes and substituted styrenes polyvinyl chloride,copolymers of vinyl chloride such as a copclymcr of 60 weight percent vinyl chloride and 40 weight percent vinyl acetate polymers and copolymers of vinylidene chloride including a copolymer of 75 percent vinylidene chloride and 25 percent acrylonitrile acrylic polymers such as polymers of methylmethacrylate, ethyl acrylate and the like. In general, the chemical composition of the polymers is not critical. The polymers must show significant swelling that is, at least 25 percent increase in volume in a period of at least 10 minutes in the organic liquid to which the polymers are required to respond under desired service conditions of temperature and pressure.Particularly advantageous materials which respond to a wide variety of organic liquids are polymers of styrene such as polystyrene and polymers of styrene and divinylbenzene containing up to 10 weight percent divinylbenzene. For general use with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylstyrene polymers and copolymers are of particular benefit. Such alkylstyrene polymers swell very rapidly on contact with aliphatic and or aromatic hydrocarbons. Generally, the more rapid the swelling of the polymer the more rapid the shutoff when the organic liquid is contacted.Alkylstyrene polymers and copolymers usually show substantial swelling when in contact with so called No. 2 diesel oil in less than one minute. Preferably, crosslinked polymers and copolymers of styrenes, and advantageously of tertiary alkylstyrenes, are utilized as the imbibing latex polymers in the process of this invention. Those alkylstyrenes which can be used to prepare these polymers have alkyl groups containing from 4 to 20, and preferably from 4 to 12, carbon atoms such as, for example, tertiary alkylstyrenes, n alkylstyrenes sec alkylstyrenes, isoalkylstyrenes and copolymers thereof. Especially preferred for use in the practice of the invention are crosslinked copolymers of such alkylstyrenes as heretofore described and an alkyl ester derived from C1 to C24 alcohol and acrylic or methacrylic acid or mixture thereof. Suitable monomers which may be employed as comonomers with the alkylstyrene include such materials as, for example, vinylnaphthalenes, styrene, vinyltoluenes, a methylstyrene, ring substituted a methylstyrenes, halostyrenes, arylstyrenes and alkarylstyrenes methacrylic esters, acrylic esters, fumarate esters and half esters, maleate esters and half esters, itaconate esters and half esters, vinyl biphenyls, vinyl esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids, alkyl vinyl ethers, alkyl vinyl ketones, a olefins, isoolefins, butadiene, isoprene, dimethylbutadiene, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. It is desirable that the latex polymers used in the process of the invention contain a slight amount of crosslinking agent, preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 2 percent by weight. The most efficient imbibition of oil and the like organic liquid contaminants occurs when the level of crosslinking agent is less than 1 percent since this permits the polymers to swell easily and imbibe a substantial volume of the organic material. When organic liquid contaminated water is percolated through a sorption bed containing 25 volume percent latex polymer coating, up to 2 percent crosslinking agent is satisfactory because a lower volume of organic material imbibed by the polymer can be tolerated in this type of operation. crosslinking agents which can be used in preparing the imbibing latex polymers suitable for use in the present invention include polyethylenically unsaturated compounds such as, for example, divinylbenzene, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diisopropenylbenzene, diisopropenyldiphenyl, diallylmaleate, diallylphthalate, allylacrylates, allylmethacrylates, allylfumarates, allylitaconates, alkyd resin types, butadiene or isoprene polymers, cyclooctadiene, methylene norbornylenes, divinyl phthalates, vinylisopropenylbenzene, divinylbiphenyl, as well as any other di or poly functional compounds known to be of use as a crosslinking agent in these polymeric vinyl addition compositions. Normally, the latex polymer containing the crosslinking agent swells with the imbibed organic material. If there is too much crosslinking agent, the imbibition takes an unreasonably long time or the latex polymer is unable to imbibe a sufficient quantity of the organic liquid to close the interstitial spaces in the bed. If the imbibitional polymer contains no crosslinking agent or too little crosslinking agent, then it will dissolve eventually in the organic material resulting, for example, into a non discrete, non particulate mass of polymer thickened organic liquid which may not effectively stop the flow. Polymers for the practice of the present invention are prepared by emulsion polymerization processes and advantageously are free radical catalyzed or initiatedFor most applications, it is desirable that latexes for use in the practice of the present invention have a par tide size of from 500 to 2000 A, although smaller and larger latex particles may be employed.Example An oil imbibing latex was prepared by polymerizing 30 parts by weight of a mixture of 70 percent by weight tertiary butylstyrene, 20 percent by weight of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, 10 percent by weight of mixed methacrylate esters of cetyl to eicosyl alcohols, and 0.075 percent by weight active , based on the weight of the foregoing three monomers, of a one to one by weight mixture of divinylbenzene and diethylbenzene, in the presence of 70 parts by weight of water containing one half part by weight based on monomers BOM of potassium persulfate, one percent by weight based on the weight of the monomers of sodium bicarbonate, two percent by weight BOM of a surface active agent which was a sodium salt of mixed long chain alkyl sulfates.The polymerization was conducted in the following manner 20 percent of the water containing the potassium persulfate and sodium bicarbonate and 2 weight percent of the total monomer mixture was added to the reactor. The reactor was agitated and heated to 800C for a period of one half hour. At the end of the half hour period, the remaining monomer and water solution of potassium persulfate and bicarbonate was added at a constant rate over a period of five hours. At the end of the addition of monomer and water, the reaction mixture was maintained at 800C with agitation for an additional one hour period.At the end of the one hour period, the reaction vessel and contents were cooled to 350C. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove any coagulum. A latex was obtain u1 having a particle size of about 1000 A which was 28.2 percent solids. The resultant latex was employed to coat a plurality of open cell polyurethane discs, 3h inches 8.9 cm in diameter and 1 4 inch 0.635 cm in thickness.The discs were coated by dipping into the latex, squeezing excess latex therefrom and drying at 800C for a period of 16 hours. The dip, squeeze and dry procedure was repeated to provide various coating weights on the polyurethane foam. The polyurethane foam had a density of 1.7 lb ft3 27.23 kg cm3 and 41 5 pores per lineal inch 2.54 cm and an air flow rate of 8 ft3 minute 226.53 liters minute through a 4 in2 25.8 cm2 sample, 1 4 inch 0.635 cm thick under a pressure of 1 2 inch 1.27 cm of water.A plurality of experiments were conducted using coated urethane discs having various coating weights of the latex thereon and discs having no coating thereon. The apparatus employed was that as generally depicted inFigure 1 and the effluent to be filtered was water containing No. 2 fuel oil. The test apparatus was fed water at a rate of 25 gallons 94.64 liters per hour and No. 2 fuel oil at 25 ml hour. Prior to entry of the water oil mixture into the foraminous disc filter, the water and oil were admixed with a propeller type agitator to provide a fine dispersion of the oil in water. The experiments were discontinued when water rose in the leg equivalent to the leg 12 at a height of 48 inches 121.9 cm or when there was evidence of oil passing through the filter assembly. A first set of urethane foam discs was employed which had no urethane coating.The head level, that is, the height of water, in the leg 12 after one hour was about 3 inches 7.62 cm and an oil slick appeared in the effluent at this time. A set of discs which had a coating weight of 23.8 percent of the hereinbefore described latex was employed and the initial head was about 5 inches 12.7 cm and a slick appeared after 2 hours at a head height of approximately 6 inches 15.24 cm . Three series of discs were then used having coating weights of 59.7 weight percent latex solids, 33.5 weight percent latex solids and 55c5 weight percent latex solids.Head height of 48 inches 121.9 cm with no slick breakthrough was achieved after about 3 hours and 10 minutes with the discs coated with 59.7 and 55.5 latex solids with no apparent breakthrough of the fuel oil. The urethane foam coated with 33.5 weight percent latex solids provided head height of 48 inches 121.9 cm in slightly under 3 hours. In all cases, a small but unmeasured quantity of duPont Oil Red A an oil soluble dye was incorporated in the fuel oil to aid in determining its distribution within the coated foam discs. In all cases where the water was passed through the latex coated foam samples and no evidence of the oil appeared, that is, the red coloration did not extend entirely through the bed, no evidence of oil in the effluent was obtained by either odor or taste. Due to the wide variety of organic materials which can be separated from water employing the present invention, the wide variety of oil imbibing latexes and the wide variety of substrates, if it is desirable to determine the suitability of any combination of organic material, latex and substrate, and latex coating weight, a convenient method of determining the suitability of the combination is to provide a coated bed, 6 inches 15.24 cm in thickness, and add in a dropwise manner the organic liquid to be removed from the aqueous stream at a temperature of 24 C. Beneficially, in such an experiment, it is convenient to include a dye which readily indicates the presence of the organic liquid in the bed. If the six inch 15.24 cm bed plugs do not permit flow of the organic liquid under a 6 inch 15.24 cm head, the combination is suitable for the practice of the invention.
