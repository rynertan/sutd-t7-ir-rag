# Xerographic printer copier device with converter for converting information from a latent image of an original document into electrical signals.

## Abstract
A xerographic printer copier includes a photoconductor drum 4 , means for producing a latent image, from an original document, on the drum and a laser beam scanning system 24, 25, 28 and 27 normally employed to produce such a latent image in response to input digital data. The system also includes a detector 30 placed adjacent the photoconductor drum at the laser scanning position. This detector is employed to produce signals representing a latent image on the drum produced by sensing the change in charge on the drum when the latent image is scanned by the laser beam 26 in an unmodulated condition.
