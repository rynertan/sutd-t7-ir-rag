# Method and apparatus for coating paper and the like.

## Abstract
Paper, paperboard or like permeable board 1, 16, 29 is coated with a coating material and aqueous carrier liquid 15 , metered over the face thereof and a partial vacuum applied to the opposite surface as the coating is dried by heating. The vacuum improves the surface smoothness of the coating. The coating can be contacted with a casting surface 10, 26 and dried at a faster rate than if no vacuum were applied.
