Pharmacoloqy The action of compounds of this invention in correcting cardiac arrhythmias or preventing cardiac arrhythmias is demonstrated by the following procedures Ouabian Induced Arrhythmias Correction of existing cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular origin is carried out on 1 adult mongrel dogs which are under barbiturate anaesthesia during the test. A GrassModel 7 Polygraph was used for recording femoral arterial blood pressure Statham P23AC Transducer and the electrocardiagram Grass 7P4 Preamplifier .Ouabain was given intravenously in an initial dose of 40 pgAg and in a second dose of 20 pg kg 30 minutes after the first dose and in subsequent doses of 10 Fg at which were repeated at 15 min. intervals as required for producing cardiac arrhythmias that persisted for at least 15 minutes. When the arrhythmias were established, the test compounds were administered by infusion Harvard Model 942 Infusion Pump into a femoral vein at a rate of 1 mg kg min. Concentration of compound was adjusted according to the weight of the dog to allow a volume infusion of 1 ml min. The compound was considered to be active as antiarrhythmic agent if reversion to sinus rhythm occurred which was maintained for at least 30 minutes. Data obtained for one preferred compound, namely 1 2 dimethylamino ethy1 a,a dipheny1 3 pyrrolidine acetamide as represented by its defumarate hemihydrate salt are shown in Table 1.

Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions for administration to a living animal body comprising, as active ingredients, at least one of the compounds according to the invention in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The compounds are thus presented in a therapeutic composition suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or intracardial administration.Thus, for example, compositions for oral administration are preferably solids and can take the form of capsules, tablets or coated tablets containing carriers conveniently used in the pharmaceutical art. Suitable tableting excipients include lactose, potato and maize starches, talc, gelatin and stearic and silicic acids, magnesium stearate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. For parenteral administration, the carrier or excipient can be a sterile, parenterally acceptable liquid e.g., water, or a parenterally acceptable oil e.g., arachis oil, contained in ampoules. In compositions for rectal administration the carrier can comprise a suppository base e.g., cocoa butter, or a glyceride. Advantageously, the compositions are formulated as dosage units, each unit being adapted to supply a fixed dose of active ingredients. Tablets, coated tablets, capsules, ampoules and suppositories are examples of preferred dosage forms according to the invention. It is only necessary that the active ingredient constitute an effective amount i.e., such that a suitable effective dosage will be obtained consistent with the dosage form employed. The exact individual dosages, as well as daily dosages, will, of course, be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of a physician or veterinarian. Generally, the pharmacology on animals suggests the oral dosage effective to correct arrhythmias will be about 3 times that of the intravenous dosage. The animal data also suggest dosage requirements will be about half that of quinidine for the more active compounds. Based on the animal data, allowing for variation in species and severity of cardiac arrhythmia, unit dosages containing an amount of compound equivalent to about 1 to about 100 mg kg of body weight are contemplated. Based on all of the above considerations, a choice in a range of unit oral dosages for humans of about 10 to about 1000 mg is contemplated, preferably about 10 to 600 mg for a more active compound such as Example 5. Daily dosages of about 30 to 2400 mg are contemplated for humans and, obviously, several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. However, the scope of the invention is not to be limited by these contemplations due to the uncertainty in transpositions discussed above.
