## Description
The present invention relates to a N fluoropyridinium salt and a process for preparing same. The N fluoropyridinium salts according to the present invention are very useful as a fluorine atom introducing agent as seen from the examples 46 109 hereinafter illustrated. The salts according to the invention have a widespread use because of their high reactivity with a wide variety of compounds and selectivity for any desired products. For example, said salt can be used for the preparation of 3 fluoro 4 hydroxyphenylacetic acid which is useful as a thyroid inhibitor by reacting the former with p hydroxyphenylacetate followed by a common hydrolysis reaction as illustrated in examples 57 to 59 referred to hereinafter. Heretofore, it has been well known in the art that fluorine compounds are significantly distinguished from chlorine compounds, bromine compounds, and iodine compounds in their physical properties and reactivities, because fluorine atoms have characteristics such as very high electronegativity, high ionization energy, extremely high bonding ability with other atoms, small Van der Waals diameter, lack of a d electron orbit and the like N.Ishikawa Y.Kobayashi In reactions with organic compounds, fluorine, contrary to chlorine, bromine and iodine, reacts very violently, readily giving rise to the fission of the C C bond of organic compounds and in cases where the reaction is excessively violent, fire or explosion in turn can break out. The abnormality of fluorination reactions relative to other halogenation reactions may be readily understood from the comparison of heat of formation in halogenation reactions see the description on pages 69 75 of the above article as follows As seen from the above Table, since the heat of reaction in the fluorination reactions amounts to even 100 Kcal mol, while the bonding energy between carbon carbon atoms is approximately only 60 Kcal mol, the control of fluorination reactions is very difficult, contrary to other halogenation reactions. Accordingly, the development of fluorination reactions having better selectivity has been an important subject matter in fluorination industries. For the purpose resolving the above problem, a wide variety of compounds for introducing fluorine atoms have heretofore been studied and developed. As such compounds, for example, trifluoromethylhypofluorite CF₃OF , trifluoroacetylhypofluorite CF₃COOF , acetylhypofluorite CH₃COOF , xenon difluoride XeF₂ , FCℓO₃, sulfur tetrafluoride SF₄ , diethylaminosulfur trifluoride Et₂NSF₃ , CCℓHFCF₂NEt₂, CF₃CFHCF₂NEt₂, heavy metal fluorides such as AgF, HgF₂, CoF₃, AgF₂ and the like were known in the art see pages 74 94 of the abovementioned article . However, these compounds have drawbacks such as poor selectivity for the desired reaction, are highly hazardous to handle, have high cost, unstableness, a limited scope of application, and the like which make them commercially unsatisfactory. On the other hand, hydrogen fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, potassium fluoride, cesium fluoride, and the like which are known as inexpensive agents for introducing fluorine atoms are inferior in electrophilic reactivity, which imposes such limitations that they cannot perform electrophilic substitutions for aromatic nuclei or negatively charged carbon ions. These compounds also present serious problems in handling because hydrogen fluoride or hydrofluoric acid, for example, are highly toxic. It has been suggested that a pyridine F₂ complex can be used as a fluorine atom introducing agent, but it can only offer low total yield of fluorination reactions see, Z. Chem., As a result of a series of earnest investigations by the present inventors towards the development of a novel fluorine introducing agent, they have succeeded in developing a novel fluorine introducing agent which is active but stable allowing the easy handling of the agent which still retains high selectivity for a desired reaction, thus completing the present invention. The compounds according to the present invention have high reactivity with a variety of compounds and high selectivity for any desired compounds, which allows the compounds to be very useful for the synthesis of a variety of fluorine containing compounds in a shortened process. For example, a thyroid inhibitor, 3 fluoro 4 hydroxyphenylacetic acid could easily be prepared from p hydroxyphenylacetate available industrially see, Examples 57 59 hereinafter described .

Further, as the variety of ammonium salts or pyridinium salts, there may be mentioned ammonium salts, trimethylammonium salts, triethylammonium salts, tetraethylammonium salts, benzyltrimethylammonium salts, phenylammonium salts, dimethylphenylammonium salts, naphthylammonium salts, pyridinium salts, dimethylpyridinium salts, trimethylpyridinium salts, quinolinium salts and the like. Of the N fluoropyridinium salts represented by formula I , in the case where X The pyridine F₂ complex where X The Brønsted acid compounds for achieving better reaction efficiencies should be equal to or in excess molar amount to that of the host material, but preferably should be an equimolar amount from an economic viewpoint. Fluorine employed in the present invention should preferably be diluted with 50 to 99.9 by volume of an inert gas in order to suppress any violent reactions. The diluting gas includes, by way of example, nitrogen, helium, argon, tetrafluoromethane, sulfur hexafluoride and the like. The fluorine gas for achieving better reaction efficiencies should be used in an equi molar or in excess molar amount to the host material.

The reaction is preferably carried out by the use of a solvent. As the solvent, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichlorofluoromethane, trichlorotrifluoroethane, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and the like or a mixture thereof may be used. A reaction temperature of 100 to 40 C may be selected, but the range of temperature of from 90 C to room temperature is being preferred for better reaction yields. In carrying out the process of the present invention it is occasinally preferable for improving the reaction efficiency to employ a trapping agent such as sodium fluoride to capture hydrogen fluoride produced as a by product. Of the N fluoropyridinium salts having the formula I , N fluoropyridinium salt having the formula I wherein R¹ to R⁵ have the same meaning as above and Y represents a Lewis acid , can be prepared by reacting the pyridine compound represented by formula II with fluorine F₂ and a Lewis acid having the formula The compounds I according to the present invention can be readily prepared and are in most cases stable in air at room temperature. These compounds enable the simple and selective introduction of a fluorine atom to a contemplated compound with good efficiency and therefore serve as a superior fluorine introducing agent. Further, as the compounds according to the present invention, after they have once been reacted, reproduce the pyridine compounds or form protonic salts or silyl salts of pyridine compounds which can readily generate pyridine compounds by neutralizatoin or treatment with water. The following examples will illustrate the present invention in more detail. To a 50 mℓ trichlrorofluoromethane solution containing 1.0 g 12.6 mmoles of pyridine a mixed gas of fluorine and nitrogen in a volumetric ratio of 1 9 was introduced at a rate of 30 mℓ min. at 78 C under vigorous stirring. The amount of the fluorine gas introduced amounted to 34.8 mmoles. Subsequent to the fluorine introduction, 20 mℓ of anhydrous acetonitrile and 2.2g 12.8 mmoles of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate as a XM reactant were added to the reaction solution after which the temperature of the solution was raised to 40 C, while removing the solvent with the aid of an aspirator. The solvent, after filtering sodium fluoride formed as a byproduct, was distilled off and the resultant residue was recrystallized from THF to give 1.75 g yield 67 of N fluoropyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate, the physical properties of which are shown in Table 5.

Subsequent to the fluorine introduction, 22 g 0.128 mole of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate as a XM reactant was added to the reaction solution after which the resultant reaction solution was maintained at 40 C for 5 hours under stirring. Subsequently, the solvent, after filtering sodium fluoride, was distilled off and the resultant residue was recrystallized from methylene chloride to give 17.5 g yield 71 of N fluoropyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate.

In 20 mℓ of anhydrous acetonitrile 0.50 g 4.67 mmoles of 2,6 dimethylpyridine and 0.803 g 4.67 mmoles of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate as the XM reactant were dissolved, and to the resultant solution a mixed gas of fluorine and nitrogen 1 9 was added at a rate of 30 mℓ min. at 40 C under vigorous stirring. The amount of the fluorine gas introduced amounted to 8.93 mmoles. After the completion of the reaction, sodium fluoride was filtered and the solvent was distilled off. The resultant residue was recrystallized from THF to give 0.88 g yield 73 of N fluoro 2,6 dimethylpyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate. The resultant product was further recrystallized with THF acetonitrile to obtain 0.82 g yield 69 , the physical properties of which are shown in Table 5.

To a 5 mℓ anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.408 g 5.17 mmoles of pyridine, 1.0 mℓ 5.17 mmoles of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate as the XM reactant was added at 40 C under stirring. To the resultant solution a mixed gas of fluorine and nitrogen 1 9 , 10 minutes after the addition, was introduced at a rate of 15 mℓ min. Examples 28 38 were carried out as in Example 27 except that in Example 34 the gas ratio of fluorine nitrogen was 2.5 97.5. The results are summarized in Table 3 with the physical properties in Table 5. In a 25 mℓ pear shaped flask, 2,4,6 trimethylpyridine 1.21 g, 10 mmoles , sodium borofluoride 1.23 g, 10 mmoles as the XM reactant and anhydrous sodium fluoride 2.1 g, 50 mmoles were dissolved in 15 mℓ of anhydrous acetonitrile and to the resulting solution a mixed gas of nitrogen fluorine 9 1 was introduced at a rate of 50 mℓ min. at 40 C under vigorous stirring. The amount of fluorine introduced was 20 mmoles. After the completion of the reaction, precipitates were filtered and then the solvent was distilled off. The resultant residue was recrystallized from acetonitrile diethyl ether to obtain 1.59 g yield 70 of N fluoro 2,4,6 trimethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate the physical properties of which are shown in Table 5. This example was effected as in example 39 to give N fluoro 4 methylpyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate in 90 yield, the physical properties of which are indicated in Table 5. To a 30 mℓ anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.71 g 8.98 mmole of pyridine a mixed gas of fluorine and nitrogen 1 9 was introduced at a rate of 20 mℓ min. at 40 C under vigorous stirring, the amount of fluorine gas introduced being 26 mmoles. Subsequently, at the same temperature, 1 mℓ 8.13 mmole of an ethereal complex of boron trifluoride as the Lewis acid was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 5 hours. The post treatment was effected as in example 39 to give 0.91 g yield 69 of N fluoropyridinium tetrafluoroborate, the physical properties of which are reproduced in Table 5. These Examples 42 to 44 were carried out as in Example 41, and the results of which are summarized in Table 4 with the physical properties in Table 5. It should be noted that the appropriate amount of boron fluoride, BF₃, was introduced in the form of a gas, because BF₃ is a gas, while SbF₅ and SO₃ are introduced in liquid form. This Example was carried out as in Example 16 except that boron trifluoride etherate was used in place of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate to obtain N fluoro 3,5 dichloropyridinium tetrafluoroborate yield 79 , the physical properties of which are given in Table 5. The Following Examples 46 109 are contemplated to elucidate the use of the compounds according to the present invention as the fluorine introducing agent. A methylene chloride solution 1 mℓ containing 1.0 mmole of phenol and 1.0 mmole of N fluoro 3,5 dichloropyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate was refluxed under an argon atmosphere for 5 hours. After the reaction was completed, the reaction solution was analysed by gas chromotography to reveal that it contained o fluorophenol 0.44 mmole , p fluorophenol 0.13 mmole , 2,4 difluorophenol 0.06 mmole and phenol 0.27 mmole . Thus, the yields of o fluorophenol, p fluorophenol and 2,4 difluorophenol were 60 ,18 , and 7 respectively. The total yield was 85 corresponding to the total conversion of 73 . It is noted that no m fluorophenol was formed. A 1,1,2 trichloroethane solution 2 mℓ containing 1.0 mmole of phenol and 0.5 mmole of N fluoropyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate was heated at 100 C for 24 hours under an argon atmosphere and 0.25 mmole of additional N fluoropyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate was added both after 3 hours and 6 hours, thus bringing the total amount of N fluoropyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate to 1.0 mmole. After the reaction, the resulting reaction solution was subjected to gas chromatography to reveal that it contained 0.40 mmole of o fluorophenol, 0.14 mmole of p fluorophenol, 0.05 mmole of 2,4 difluorophenol and 0.21 mmole of phenol. Therefore, the yields of o ,p fluorophenols and 2,4 difluorophenol were 51 ,18 and 6 respectively, corresponding to the total yields to 75 , with the total conversion of 79 . A wide variety of fluorine containing compounds were prepared by reacting N fluoropyridinium salts according to the present invention with an equi molar amount of compounds contemplated to be fluorinated. These examples were carried out similar to Example 46 with the reaction conditions set forth in Tables 6 9. The results obtained are also indicated in Tables 6 9. The identification of the structures of the resulting compounds were effected by comparing those with a standard specimen or with spectroscopy.
