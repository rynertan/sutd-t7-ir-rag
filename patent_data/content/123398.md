# Method of and apparatus for transporting workpieces into and out of a press or other workstation.

## Abstract
A pressed material 56 is withdrawn from a lower metal mould 6 in a press in accordance with a horizontal, pivotal movement and a vertical, linear movement of a carry out arm, and a material to be pressed is fed from a preceding stage to the press in accordance with a horizontal, pivotal movement and a vertical, linear movement of a carry in arm. In this method of feeding a material to be pressed 55 , the height of a path along which the carry out arm is turned is set larger than that of a path along which the carry in arm is turned. The operations of the carry in arm and carry out arm are timed in such a manner that a material being newly fed and a pressed material being sent out are overlapped as they are vertically spaced at a predetermined distance from each other, in a position abvoe a lower metal mould in the press. In an apparatus for feeding materials to be pressed, a fulcrum for a pivotal movement of at least one of the carry in arm and carry out arm is set on a rear surface of a bolster of the press. The positions, to which gripper means 37, 38, 39 provided on the carry in arm are applied, on a material to be pressed 55 are determined in the circumferential portion thereof which enters a zone of movement of an upper metal mould 5 in such a position only that is in the vicinity of a dead point of pivotal movement of the carry in arm on the carry in action terminating side thereof. The positions, to which gripper means 40, 41, 42 provided on the carry out arm are applied, on a pressed material are determined in the circumferential portion thereof which enters a zone of movement of the upper metal mould in such a position only that is in the vicinity of a dead point of pivotal movement of the carry out arm on the carry out action starting side thereof.
