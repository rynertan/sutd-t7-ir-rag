# Method of protecting bacteria.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for protecting a bacterium from a naturally occurring bacteriophage com prising transforming the bacterium with a recombinant DNA cloning vector comprising 1 a DNA segment that confers a restriction and cognate modification activity to said bacterium, 2 a replicon that is functional in said bacterium, and 3 a gene that expresses a functional polypeptide in said bacterium, subject to the limitation that 1 said naturally occurring bacteriophage contains double stranded DNA with a restric tion site of the same specificity as the restriction activity conferred to said bacterium, and 2 that said modification activity is expressed in said bacterium prior to said restric tion activity. The cloning vectors and transformants for carrying out the method are also described.
