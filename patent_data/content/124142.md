# Advance variator for a fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improvement in internal combustion engine injection pump, according to which the injection timing is modified by moving the timing element 9 by means of a hydraulic actuator 41 fed with fuel which varies in pressure with the pump speed and which urges the actuator piston 42 against elastic means which react with in an axially mobile rotating cylinder 47 , of which the axial position is determined by contact between two cam sur faces 52, 56 in series, and of which the rotation is a func tion of the position of the pump throughout control members.
