# Method of treating insoluble sulfur with oil and the insoluble sulfur product obtained thereby.

## Abstract
Processing oil used to treat insoluble sulfur can lead to reversion of the sulfur to the soluble form even when it has been stabilized. This reversion is inhibited by mixing iodine with the oil. An amount of oil from 1 to 200 milligrams per liter of oil can be used. The insoluble sulfur product may contain from 1 to 30 of the oil based on the total weight of the product.
