## Description
ME THOD FOR PREPARATION OF N PHOSPHONOMETHYLGtYCINE This invention relates to a novel method for the preparaticn ofN phosphonomethylglycine, a compound which is a known herbicide and plant growth regulator. Herbicides are widely used by farmers, commercial agricultural companies, and other industries in order to increase crop yields for such staple crops as corn, soybeans, rice, and the like, and to eliminate weed growth along highways, railroad rights of way, and other areas. Herbicides are effective in killing or controlling unwanted weeds which oomr pete for soil nutrients with the crop plants, and by reason of the fact that they kill weeds are responsible for improving the aesthetic appear ance of highway and railroad rights of way. There are a number of different types of herbicides presently sold oommercially, and these fall into two general categories. The categories are pre emergence and postemergence herbicides.The pre emergence herbicides are incorpdrated into the soil prior to the emergence of the weed plants fran the soil, and the post emergence herbicides are applied to plant surfaces after emergence of the weeds or other unwanted plants fran the soil. One of the earliest post emergence herbicides used commercially was 2,4 D 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid . After a number of years of use of this and similar compounds such as 2,4,5 T 2,4,5 trichlorophenoxy acetic acid , it was found that certain decomposition products of these herbicides were long lasting and were not biodegradable. While there has been some dispute between governmental agencies and commercial interests regarding the effects of residual products of 2,4 D, 2,4,S T and similar oDmpounds, the agencies nevertheless restricted the use of these herbiciders in the United States some years ago.Since that time, efforts have been made to develop herbicides which are biodegradable into harmless residues within a relatively short time after their application. One such compound, which has been found to be biodegradable, yet which is effective as a herbicide and plant growth regulator when employed at lower rates, is N phosphonomethylglycine and various salts thereof. N Phosphonomethylglycine and agriculturally effective salts have been approved for use by the U.S. Government, and, as a consequence, this herbicide has become extremely successful commercially. N Phosphonomethylglycine and certain salts are the only effective and approved post emergence herbicides in the field. The present ccmmercial compound is the isopropylamine salt of N phosphonomethylgly cine and derivatives thereof. In field use it is normally applied in amounts of from 0.01 to about 20 pounds per acre, preferably from 2 to 6 pounds per acre. N Phosphonomethylglycine, and certain soluble salts thereof, can be made in a number of different ways. One such method, as described in U.S. Patent 3,160,632 Tby et al., December 8, 1964 is to reactN phosphinomethylglycine glycinemethylenephosphinic acid with mercuric chloride in a water solvent at reflux temperature, and subsequently separating the reaction products. Another method is the reaction of ethyl glycinate with formaldehyde and diethylpaosphite. The latter method is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,799,758 Franz, March 26, 1974 . In addition, there is a whole series of patents, relating to N phosphono methylglycine, its salts, and derivatives thereof, described as being useful herbicides and plant growth regulators. Such additional patents relating to N phosphonomethylglycine, methods of application, methods of preparation, salts, and derivatives, include U.S. Patent 3,868,407, U.S.Patent 4,197,254, and U.S. Patent 4,199,354, among others. Because of the importance of N phosphonomethylglycine and certain salts as a herbicide, other methods of making the compounds are constantly being sought in order to provide improved or alternate methods of manufacture. It has now been discovered that N phosphonanethylglycine can be produced by a reacting hydantoin or a 3 substituted hydantoin, compounds of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R is selected fran the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, aryl having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, alkyl carbonyl wherein the alkyl group has from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and arylcarbonyl wherein the aryl group has from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, with paraformaldehyde in the presence of a low molecular weight carboxylic acid at a temperature and for a sufficient period of time to produce a mixture of intermediate products, including the 1 hydroxymethyl derivative b converting said l hydroxymethyl derivative to 1 phos phonomethyihydantoin by thereafter adding to the reaction mixture either i a substituted phosphorous compound selected from the group consisting of phosphorus trichloride, and phosphorus tri bromide or ii phosphorous acid and a carboxylic acid anhydride selected from the group consisting a acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, or a similar asymmetrical anhy dride and continuing said reaction at a temperature and for a sufficient period of time to cause completion of the reaction to form the 1 phosphonomethyl derivative and c hydrolyzing said 1 phosphonomethyl derivative thus formed with an aqueous solution of a base selected from the group consisting of alkali metal or alkaline earth hydroxide to produce a salt of N phos phonomethylglycine and d neutralizing said salt with a strong acid to produce the end product, N phosphonomethylglycine. The starting compound for use in the process of the invention is hydantoin, or a 3 substituted hydantoin, whose formula is indicated above. The preferred starting compound is the unsubstituted hydantoin, but 3 substituted hydantoins can be used, such as 3 methylhydantoin, 3 ethylhydantoin, and the like.Also suitable for use would be other alkyl substituted hydantoins at the 3 position having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, the aryl substituted hydantoins at the 3 posiion having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, the alkylcarbonyl substituted hydantoins at the 3 position having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, and the arylcarbonylsubstituted hydantoins at the 3 position having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the aryl group. The substituted compounds are less preferred, however, because of their greater cost. Paraformaldehyde is used in the process of the invention in order to eliminate water from the initial steps of the reaction. Aqueous formalin is obviously unsuitable because water is undesirable. Acetic acid is the preferred low molecular weight carboxylic acid for use in step a of the process of the invention. Other suitable low molecular weight carboxylic acids which can be used include propanoic acid and butanoic acid, for example. The most preferred substituted phosphorus compound for use in the above process is phosphorus trichloride. Other phosphorus compounds which can be used include phosphorus tribromide. The preferred base for use in step c of the process is sodium hydroxide, however, other bases such as potassium hydroxide or barium hydroxide could also be used. The preferred anhydride for use in step b ii is acetic axily dride. Other suitable anhydrides which can be used, however, include propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, and mixed anhydrides of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. The preferred acid for use in step d of the process of the invention is hydrochloric acid, however, other acids such as hydrobroslic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, can be used.These acids may be described as relatively strong protic acids and any other acids falling within that purview would be suitable for use also. Using the preferred compounds the overall reaction for the process of the invention can be presented as follows EMI5.1 hydantoin paraformaldehyde hydroxymethyl hydantoinEMI5.2 phosphorus acetic acetic phosphorous hydrogen trichloride acid anhydride acid chloride and orEMI5.3 hydroxymethyl phosphorous acetic 1 phosphonomethyl acetic hydantoin acid anhydride hydantoin acidEMI5.4 1 phosphonomethyl N phosphonomethylglycine hydantoin trisodium saltEMI5.5 In the process of the invention, the starting hydantoin compound, paraformaldehyde, and phosphorus trichloride are all used at approximately stoichiometric amounts in a ratio of 1 1 1. The low molecular weight carboxylic acid is generally present in excess.The same applies for the sodium hydroxide used in step c , and in step d , sufficient acid is used to bring the pH of the reaction mixture down to approximately 1.4, which is the pH at which the end product, N phosphonomethylglycine, crystallizes most efficiently out of solution. The first step of the reaction is conducted at reflux temperature, and when acetic acid is used as the carboxylic acid, this temperature ranges from approximately 115 to 120 C. The hydantoin and formaldehyde are refluxed for approximately 45 minutes. However, the exact amount of time is not critical. The phosphorus trichloride in step b is initially added to the reaction mixture at roan temperature and is then heated to reflux.Hydrogen chloride is evolved as the reactants are heated, thus, the temperature is raised slowly over a period of approximately 50 minutes until reflux is reached, again being approximately between 115 and 120 C, After the reflux temperature is reached, the reactants are refluxed for an additional 20 minutes to insure completion of the reaction. While not shown in the formulas, water can optionally be added at the end of step b while the reactants are at reflux temperature.After water is added, the reaction mixture is refluxed for approximately 2 hours. The bulk of the carboxylic acid water solvent mixture is then removed by evaporation at reduced pressure. The base of step d is added at room temperature and the hydrolysis step is conducted at reflux approximately 102 C for a period of approximately 24 hours, when sodium hydroxide is used as the base of choice. It has been found that the yield of phosphonomethylhydantoin can be improved if acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride is added at the very beginning of step a along with the paraformaldehyde and hydantoin.The reason for the improvement in yield is not exactly known. However, this improvement is only obtained when hydantoin is used rather than a 3 substituted derivative. Thus, when hydantoin is used, the preferred process includes the addition of acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride along with the other components in step a at the beginning of the reaction. This invention will be better understood by reference to the specific example which follows, which serves to illustrate the instant invention. EXAMPLE I Preparation of N Phosphonomethylglycine Trisodiuum Salt A 500 milliliter ml , round bottom flask was vas equipped with a thermometer, condenser, magnetic stirrer and heating mantle. Into this flask was charged, under nitrogen, 10 grams g 0.10 mole of hydantoin and 3.2 g 0.10 mole of paraformaldehyde ca. 95 pure , along with 60 ml of anhydrous acetic acid. The mixture was then heated to reflux and maintained at reflux for 45 minutes. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was cooled to roan temperature and at that time 13.8 g 0.10 mole of phosphorus trichloride was charged all at once. An exotherm occurred.The reaction mixture was slowly heated to reflux while gas evolved. During the heating period a white precipitate 1,1 methane bis hydantoin formed and then redissolved. The reaction mixture was kept at reflux for approximately 2 hours, and thereafter 150 ml of water was added and the mixture refluxed for an additional 1.5 hours. The mixture was then vacuum stripped at 70 C to give crude 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin as 24.4 g of a viscous pink oil. The crude product was assayed quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and found to be 43.7 pure. me yield, then, was 10.7 g, 56 of theory. EXNMPLE IIPreparation of N phosPhonamethylglycine from 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin Crude I phosphonomethyl hydantoin was prepared as described above, induced to cyrstallize at low temperature, and then partially purified by digestion in refluxing isopropyl alcohol ether 1 5 . The purified material was assayed by hplc on an anion exchange column and found to be 75.3 weight pure. A solution of 1.94 g 7.53 mmole of this material and 50 ml 2 N aqueous NaOH was heated at reflux 102 C for 24 hours. The cooled reaction mixture was assayed by hplc analysis on an anion exchange column and found to contain 7.65 0.40 itrrole of N phosphonomethylglycine trisodium salt.The yield of the salt, therefore, was approximately 100 . The solution of the salt was acidifed with 12 N HCl to cH 1.5 and filtered to remove precipitaed white solids probably silicic acid .The filtrate was chilled, seeded, and allowed to stand at ca 5 C for a few days. A precipitate of crystalline phosphonomethylglycine formed and was isolated by filtration, washing, and drying. The yield was 0.48 g 1.84 mmol, 38 based on 1 phosphonomethylglcyine . The rmr and ir spectra of the product were identical to those of authentic material. EXAMPLE III Preparation of 1 PhosPhonomethyl hYdantoin The preparation of 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin was carried out by a slight modification of the method of Example I. The only change made was that 11.2 g 0.110 mole of acetic anhydride was added at the outset. The yield of 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin was 76 of the theoretical amount. EXAMPLE IT Preparation of 1 Phosphonomethyl hydantoin The preparation was carried out by a slight modification of the method of Example I. The change made was that 8.6 g 0.110 mole of acetyl chloride was added at the outset. This made it necessary to heat the initial mixture with caution, because a strongly exothermic reaction, accompanied by gas evoluation, occurred when heating was begun. In all other respects the method used was the same as that of Example I. The yield of 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin was was 75 of the theoretical amount. EXAMPLE V Preparation of 1 Phosphonomethyl hydantoin A 500 ml round bottom flask was equipped with a thermometer, condenser, magnetic stirrer, and heating mantle. Into the flask was charged, under nitrogen, 10.0 g 0.100 mole of hydantoin, 3.2 g 0.10 mole of paraformaldehyde purity ca 95 , and 60 ml of anhydrous acetic acid. The resulting mixture was heated at reflux for 0.75 hour and then cooled. To the resulting clear solution was added 8.5 g 0.100 mole of 97 phosphorous acid and 30.6 g 0.300 mole of acetic anhdyride. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux over 1.2 hours and held at reflux for another 0.1 hour. A white solid precipitated early in the heating period and then redissolved toward the end. The reaction mixture was cooled somewhat, and 150 ml of water was added to it.The resulting solution was heated at reflux for 2.0 hours, cooled, and vacuum stripped at 70 C to give 21.4 g of crude 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin as an oil. Quantitative analysis by hplc showed the yield of 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin to be 46 . EXAMPLE VI N Phosphonomethylglycine Trisodium Salt Crude 3 methyl 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin 6.54 g was prepared by the method of Example I from 2.85 g 0.025 mole of 3 methylhydantoin, 0.8 g ca 0.025 mole of paraformaldehyde, 11 ml of anhydrous acetic acid, and 3.5 g 0.024 mole of phosphorus trichloride. A portion 5.56 g of the crystalline crude product was dissolved in 10 ml of water, and the solution was basified to pH 10.7 with 20 aqueous sodium hydroxide. To the resulting solution was added 200 ml of 2 N sodium hydroxide. The solution obtained was heated at reflux for 24 hours, cooled, weighed and quantitatively assayed by hplc for N phosphonomethylglcyine trisodium salt. The yield was found to be 72 of the theoretical amount. In carrying out the process of the invention, it should be noted that after phosphorus trichloride is added to the reaction mixture, a white precipitate normally crystallizes out, but is later dissolved when the solution is heated to reflux temperature. The crystalline compound has been isolated and found to be 1,1 methane bis hydantoin. It has been found that this substance is converted to 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin 49 yield when it is treated with phosphorus trichloride and acetic acid and the reaction mixture is worked up in the usual way. In step b of the process of the invention, it makes little difference whether sub section i or ii is followed because the end product is the same in both instances. Thus, when the phosphorus trichloride is added and used in conjunction with acetic acid, the intermediate product produced is I phosphonomethyl hydantoin, while when section a ii is used, and acetic anhydride and phosphorous acid are ca n bined, the product is still 1 phosphonomethyl hydantoin. It is believed that the phosphorus trichloride and acetic acid react in solution to give phosphorous acid and acetic anhydride, the components used in step b ii as shown above.
