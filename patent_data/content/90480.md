# Heavy duty electrical connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector having as parts a plug 11 and receptacle 10 which are releasably mated by selective rotation of a coupling ring 20 carried by one of said parts for interconnecting pin 34 and socket contacts respectively mounted within said connector parts, and including a first rigid insulator 31 in one of the connector parts within which the socket contact is located, and a second rigid insulator 32 in the other connector part including the pin contact extending from a surface therof characterised by a body 36 of resilient insulative material located over the second rigid insulator 32 surface, said body having a thickness dimension measured along the pin contact 34 sufficient to compressingly contact the first rigid insulator 31 when the parts are mated and when the maximum tolerance spacing between the two insulators exists.
