## Description
A Machine for the removal and fitting of pneumatic tyres.The invention herein described is a machine for the removal and fitting of pneumatic tyres. It is particularly suited for the removal and fitting of tyres having somewhat large dimensions, such as those used for the equipping of heavy duty vehicles, for example lorries, agricultural machinery and earth moving machines etc..There are various kinds of apparatus for removing and fitting tyres from to large diameter wheels, which comprise a self centring platform revolving around a horizontal aXis and borne on the extremity of a strong support arm which in turn pivots on a horizontal axis parallel to that of the self centring platform. The ability of the said arm to rotate around the pivot to which it is hinged enables positioning of the selfcentring platform s axis at a varing height in order to centre it correspondingly with the individual wheel before it. The arm is normally caused to rotate by means of a jack. The self centring platforms which form part of such embodiments are invariably complicatetl both in design and in structure.The object of the invention herein described is that of giving place to a tyre removing and fitting machine, particularly adapted to large diameter wheels , which is extremely simple in construction, and which can be manoeuvred easily and conveniently.These and other objects are obtained by the invention herein described which concerns a machine for the removal and fitting of pneumatic tyres characterised by the fact that it comprises a permanent chassis, a movable chassis running along similarly orientated rectilinear guides inclined with respect to the vertical, this bearing a self centring platform revolving around a horizontal axis and serving to receive and lock the rims of wheels to which the said pneumatic tyres are fitted, centring them with respect to a horizontal axis a tool bearing arm with its axis disposed in a plane parallel to thatin which the said guides are orientated.and which contains the axis of the said self centring device.Further characteristics and advantages will emerge more clearly from the detailed description that follows of a preferred though not exclusive form of embodiment of the invention herein described illustrated purely as an unlimited example in the accompanying drawings, in which fig 1 shows a machine, in perspective , of the type herein described fig 2 shows a vertical elevation of a lateral view of fig 1 fig 3 shows the axial cross section of a first form of embodiment of the invention1 a self centring platform in two different operating position67 fig 4 shows the axial cross section of a second form of embodiment of the invention 5 self centring platform in two different operating positions fig 5 shows a further form of embodiment of the invention, in perspective fig 6 shows, in large scale , a vertical elevation of the lateral view of an appliance used with the embodiments illustrated in fig 5, mounted upon which is a first kind of tool, in working position fig 7 shows the same view as in fig 6, but in a different working position fig 8 shows a lateral view of fig 6, from the right hand side fig 9 shows the vertical elevation of a lateral view of the appliance illustrated in figs 5,6,7 and 8, mounted upon which is a second kind of t tool figs 9a 9b show cross sections according to I I II II in fig 9 fig 10 shows a lateral view of fig 9, from the left hand side fig 1 shows a plan of fig 9, from above With reference to the said drawings, 1 indicates a permanent chassis bearing upon it a robust vertical structure 2 cn which, inclined with respect to the vertical , the cylindrical rectilinear guides 3 are located. A movable chassis 4 runs along these guides 3 which suppports a self centring platform 5 that revolves around a horizontal axis and serves to receive and lock the wheel rims, centring them with respect to the said horizontal axis. A tool bearing arm 6 is disposed with its actual axis in a plane parallel to that defined by the guides 3 and containing the selfcentring platform s 5 axis.The tool bearing arm 6 is hinged at its lower end around a pivot 8 which is disposed parallel with the self centring platform s 5 a is of rotation, the said arm sliding the length of the said pivot. A jack provides for the tool bearing arm s 6 traverse along the pivot 8 . The positioning of the tool 7 , provision for which is made at the tool bearing arm s 6 extremity , with respect to the rim 10 of the wheel 9 is quite easy, it is in fact sufficient to effect the traverse of the chassis 4 along the guides 3 until the correct position is arrived at, i.e. that of the work piece.The position thus obtained will always be correct geometrically, in that the said arm s axis, and the axis of the selfcentring platform 5 always share the same plane, notwithstanding the position which may be assumed by the latter as a result of the chassis 4 movement along the guides 3 .The machines command controls are grouped together in a frame 11 suspended at the extremity of an arm 12 which is incorporated into the upppermost part of the vertical structure 2 In a form of embodiment of the invention shown in fig 3 the self centring platform 5 consists of a body 13 onto which are hinged four angular equidistant jaws 143, Each jaw is engaged mechanically a5 though it were a rod having the function of connecting rod for an articulated parallelogram in which the opposing rod serves as bridge or base The axes of each of the jaws1 t14 articulating pivots 15 16 are parallel and are contained within a plane that is continuously vertical regardless of the position assumed by the jaw. One of the rods having the function of crank for each jaw 14 is composed of twp angular levers 17 disposed parallel a nd symmet rically with respect to that plane containing the axis of the self centring platform 5 . Each of the jaws 14 pair of angular levers 17 is coupled together, and ful nished with a pivot 18 which is engaged by a groove 19 located in one arm of a quasi cruciform body which is in turn fixed tb the extremity of the shaft 22 of a dynamic fluid driver cylinder 23 .The dynamic fluid cylinder 23 is disposed coaxially to the selfcentring platform 5 to which it is integrated. The two angular levers 17 composing one of the rods which has the function of connecting rod for the said articulated parallelogram are hinged to the body 13 of the selfcentring platform 5 by means of a pivot 24 the other rod, which has the function of crank for the said articulated parallelogram and indicated by the number 26 , has a rectilinear axis and is hinged to the body 13 of the self centring platform 5 by means of a pivot 24 the rod 26 and the angular levers 17 are connected to the individual jaw 14 by means of their respective pivots 15 16 . The axes of pivots 24 and 25 are likewise parallel and lie in a vertical plane parallel to that containing the axes of pivots 15 and 16 . The passage from tXe posture of the jaw from position A to that of B, these being the largest qrippinq diameter of the fully extended jaw and the smallest gripping diameter of the fully retracted jaw rezspectively , is obtained simply, beinq the product of that axial traverse executed by the shaft 22 of the dynamic fluid driver cylinder 23 . This said traverse in fact causes the angular levers 17 to rotate around the corresponding pivot 24 and hence the opening or closing of the self centring mechanism.The self centring platform s 5 gripping diameter scope, that is from the jaw s minimum diameter gripping capability when in posture B to its maximum said capability when in posture A , is considerably wide, departing from a minimum of 14 to a maximum of 42 This makes it possible to work on wheels of varying diameter without the need for adapting the self centring device when changing from a small diameter wheel to a much larger, or vice versa.In a second form of embodiment in fig 4 the pivot 18 and groove 19 arrangement is replaced by a connection rod 27 hinged to a pivot 28 located onjthe anqular levers 17 in like manner to the pivot 18 in the first form of embodiment, and to a pivot 29 fixed to the extremity of the shaft 22 of the dynamic fluid driver cylinder 23 The dynamic fluid driver cylinder 23 is double acting so as to command the opening and the closing of the self centring platform s 5 jaws. In the event of an embodiment s incorporating a single acting dynamic fluid driver cylinder, provision would need to be made for return springs operating between the angular levers 17 and the rods 26 of each jaw.The self centring platform s 5 rotary movement is. transmitted by means of a motor 30 which propels a pinion 31 and by a crown wheel located on the outer perimeter of the body 13 of the self centring platform 5 the said crown wheel and pinion forming a gear pair. The driver cylinder 23 may be substituted by some similar device, for instance a screw mechanism which would produce axial terse of the shaft 22 .The form of embodiment illustrated in fig 5 shows a self centring platform 5 which revolves around a horizontal axis, borne on the extremity of a robust arm 35 which is pivoted to the chassis 1 around a horizontal axis parallel with that of the said self centring platform.The ability of the arm 35 to rotate around the pivot to which it is hinged allows the positioning of the self ce ntring platform s 5 axis at a variable height in order to centre it correspondingly with the individual wheel before it.The removal or fitting of a tyre from to the wheel 9 is achieved by means of a single appliance 33 which can be utilised by operating either on that side of the wheel 9 opposed to the self centring platform 5 or on the side opposite. The appliance 33 compw rises a tool bearing arm 6 which is hinged at its lower end around a pivot 8 having its axis disposed parallel with that of the said self centring platform s 5 axis of rotation.The tool bearing arm 6 is coupled to the pivot 8 so as to slide axially thereon, both right and left.The tool bearing arm 6 is telescopic, and provision is made at its upper extremity for a disc like, or wheel type tool 7 for removal and Or fitting the tyre.The tool 7 is mounted onto a support 343 which in turn is planted onto a pivot 36 located at the extremity of the toolhearing arin 6 , The pivot 36 is disposed coaxially with respect to the axis of the tool bearing arm 6 The support 34 can be rotated around the pivot 36 and may be locked with respect to the latter, and thus to the tool bearing arm 6 TI in two operating positions, these last being disposed symOetri.cally with.respect to the vertical plane containing the tool bearing arm s 6 axis.The actual transfer from that operating position defined by letter A, wherein the tool 7 operates on that side of the wheel 9 opposed to the self centring platform 5 , to position B, wherein the tool 7 operates on the opposite side of the wheel 9 is achieved simply by rotating the support 34 around the pivot 36 so as to take the former through half a complete revolution.Locking of the support 34 to the tool bearing arm 6 into either one of the two said positions is achieved by means of a locking device comprising a locking lever member 37 integrated into the rotating support 34 which couples by engaging either one of two slots 38 incorporated into the extremity of the tool bearing arm 6 whose positions are diametrically opposed with respect to the axis around which the support 34 is pivoted.The locking member 37 is prismatic In shape and is pivoted to the support 34 by meansxof a pin 38 in such a way that that extremity 4o .of the locking member 37 which couples by engaging either one of the two slots 38 is shaped and disposed with its actual generating lines parallel with that axis around which.the support 34 is pivoted.In addition, the generating lines of the opposed parallel and lateral surfaces of the slots 38 are thus parallel with the axis of the said pivot 36 .The slots 38 in fact take the form of notches, cut radially into a circular plate 41 which is fixed to the upper extremity of the tool bearing arm 6 ,By pressing of the extremity of the member 37 opposite to that extremity numbered 40 towards the support 34 one achieves disengagement of the said extremity 40 from the slot 38 in which it is seated. In fact the movement described by the said locking member s 37 rotation around the pivot 39 is parallel with the said opposed parallel and lateral surfaces. A spring 43 operating between the support 34 and the locking member 37 performs the function of keeping that appropriate extremity 40 of the locking member 37 engaged within the individual slot 38 that it happens to be inserted. With the tool 7 in position B one may, for example, proceed to break the bead heel of a tubeless tyre on the side opposite , with reference to 9 in fig 5 , to that opposing the self centring platform 5 In order to carry out bead breaking and removal of the tyre by operating on that side of the tyre opposing the said platform 5 it is sufficient to move the toolwbearing arm 6 along the pivot 8 , position it accordingly, and then to rotate the support 34 through one half of a complete revolution.For this last step to be accomplished the locking member 37 must be worked by pressing on the appropriate extremity 42 towards the support 34 thus disengaging the said extremity 40 from within the slot 38 which it is seated, and then to rotate the support 37 , to which the tool 7 is locked , through 1800. Once that exact position which provokes the action of the spring 43 is arrived at, the appropriate extremity 40 will automatically be engaged by the other slot 38 . Once thus engaged there is no possibility of the support s 34 hence the tool s 7 rotating around the pivot 36 . Figs 9, 10 and 11 show a second tool 443 for removing and fitting tyres, being appropriately profiled and forming a single body with the support 45 which, by virtue of its being similar to the support 34 aforementioned is planted on that pivot 36 at the extremity of the tool bearing arm 6 and has likewise integrated a locking member 37 pivoted around a pin 39 ,which couples by engaging with either of the two slots 38 .Clearly, numerous modification8 of a practical nature may be made to the constructional details of the invention herein described without there being in any way a deviation from the framework of protection afforded to the conceptual ideas behind the invention as claimed below.
