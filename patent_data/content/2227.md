## Abstract
Neutron absorbing article. e.g. a plate, suitable for use in storage racks for spent nuclear fuel prevent uncontrolled nuclear reactions, composed of finely divided boron carbide particles and a solid, irreversibly cured phenolic polymer forming a continuous matrix about the boron carbide particles which contain at least 6 by weight of B¹⁰ preferably, the phenolic polymer is a phenol formaldehyde type polymer, and the proportions of boron carbide and phenol formaldehyde type polymer preferably free of halogens, mercury, lead and sulfur are from 20 to 35 of the former and 65 to 80 of the latter. Method for the manufacture of the article wherein a portion of the phenol formaldehyde type resin, in the liquid state, is mixed with the boron carbide particles, compacted and cured, after which the cured article is impregnated with additional phenol formaldehyde type resin, which is then cured to make the final product
