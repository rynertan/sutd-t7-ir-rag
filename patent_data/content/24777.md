# Supporting fabric for bearing bulk material and a method of building road, dike or dam embankments.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a supporting fabric having a width of at least 30 cm, and preferably more than 2 5 m, and containing warp 1 and weft 3 yarns of a synthetic material, for bearing one or more layers 7, 8, 9 of sand, gravel, stones, clay, loam or similar bulk or other material to a height of at least 10 cm, which height is in actual practice often 5 15 m. The yarns extending in the warp direction of the fabric are formed by straight warp yarns 1 and binder warp yarns 2 , the straight warp yarns 1 each having a higher strength than the binder warp yarns 2 . The invention also comprises a method for building a road embankment, a dike, a dam or some other structure formed from bulk material, such as, for instance, sand, gravel or stones. In such a structure one or more layers of supporting fabric are incorporated.
