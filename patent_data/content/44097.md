# Process for the preparation of a copolymer.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a copolymer of alpha methylstyrene and acrylonitrile in aqueous dispersion, in the presence of a compound sup plying free radicals, in which process not all of the reaction heat released during the polymerization is removed by means of cooling, so that the rate of monomer conversion has a maximum. The object of the invention is to obtain a product having an improved heat resistance. According to the invention this process is characterized in that during the polymerization the temperature of the aqueous dispersion is not allowed to become higher than 110 C, and in that the mean rate of temperature rise per hour is kept at a value below 60 C per hour.
