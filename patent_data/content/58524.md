# Foldable and portable bicycle quick release clamp.

## Abstract
A foldable, portable bicycle in which the handlebar, its elongated post, the seat assembly, the pedal crank and the frame are foldable quickly and easily into a compact and regular shaped package that is easily portable and storable, and are unfoldable with similar speed and ease into a safe, durable and comfortable bicycle that accommodates adults of normal size. The frame is designed with a low profile that is substantially the same in height and thickness as the dimensions of the wheels and their supports, and the handlebar and seat assemblies extend upwardly to normal height, but fold and collapse in novel ways, along with the pedals, to substantially within the confines outlined by the folded frame. The handlebar assembly includes a longitudinally exten able and contractable post comprising two telescoping post sections that are held releasably in different telescoped dry positions by a quick release clamp having an elongated actuating lever that is connected to a screw clamping mechanism mounted on a collar disposed around a flexible portion of one of the telescoping members. The lever provides a relatively high mechanical advantage for quick and easy clamping with a short rotary motion, and is mounted on the screw clamping mechanism by means of a splined and tapered head and socket connection. This con nection permits ready angular adjustment of the lever to lie unobtrusively alongside the post in the clamped position, despite variations in this position in use.
