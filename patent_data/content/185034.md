## Description
This invention relates to a protein, inhibin, to a method of obtaining and purifying it, to certain fragments and derivatives thereof, and to the uses of these materials. On the basis of circumstantial evidence and limited experimentation, it was suggested as early as 1932 that the gonads produced non steroidal factor, termed inhibin, which was capable of selectively suppressing the pituitary gland secretion of follicle stimulating hormone FSH McCullagh, Science The properties of bovine follicular fluid extracts have led to the postulate that there is therein a substance or substances, inhibin , with specific functions. We have now isolated such a material from a gonadal source and this material satisfies all the biological criteria which are characteristic of inhibin. According to one aspect of the present invention, therefore there is provided a purified protein, inhibin, characterised in that According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of isolating and purifying inhibin from mammalian ovarian follicular fluid, characterised by the following steps The invention further comprises the two sub units as novel materials The invention further comprises certain fragments of the novel inhibin material, and thus includes a proteinaceous material which has the following properties of a fragment of the protein inhibin defined above, namely The invention also comprises a derivative of the novel inhibin, which derivative can be administered as an antigen in mammals to raise antibodies against inhibin to thereby raise the follicle stimulating hormone levels in the mammals. The invention additionally comprises a homologue of the novel inhibin, wherein said homologue can be administered as a antigen in mammals to raise antibodies against inhibin to thereby raise the follicle stimulating hormone levels in the mammals. In the method of the invention for isolating and purifying the inhibin, the gel permeation chromatography step is preferably carried out using a gel permeation support with high pore volume, for example Sephacryl S200 or Sephadex G100 both Sephacryl and Sephadex are trade marks of Pharmacia . Preferred elution methods utilize volatile solvents containing, for example, ammonium acetate, acetic acid, or similar compounds, to allow direct recovery of biological activity by lyophilization or vacuum drying. Preferably, the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography is carried out using chemically bonded N alkylsilica column packings of narrow particle size distribution, most suitably 5 10µm. The eluents used may be volatile or non volatile, and contain ionic modifiers such as trifluoroactic acid TFA , ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium acetate, or sodium phosphate, in a gradient of water with a miscible organic solvent such as methanol, acetonitrile, or isopropanol. A preferred procedure utilizes a gradient of 0 50 acetonitrile in 0.1 TEA. Various preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE methods can be employed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS using PAGE gels of various porosities and cross linking content. A preferred buffer system for electrophoresis is based on the method of Laemmli, as described in Nature The invention also includes a method of raising specific antibodies to the inhibin, said antibodies having the ability to neutralize the activity of inhibin in the The invention further includes a method of producing monoclonal antibodies specific to inhibin comprising producing the monoclonal antibodies using the protein inhibin of the invention, or an inhibin sub unit of the invention, or the proteinaceous material of the invention referred to hereinabove. There is still further provided a method for the radioimmunoassay of inhibin which can be used for the measurement of inhibin in biological samples such as plasma, serum or urine. The present invention will now be described by way of example only in the following non limiting examples, and the accompanying drawings in which Abbreviations used herein are as follows The purification procedure is based on the sequential application of one or more gel permeation steps, one or more reversed phase high resolution chromatography steps and one or more PAGE steps. Bovine ovaries were obtained from local abattoirs and bFF aspirated into a chilled vessel containing the protease inhibitors Trasylol 10 U ml and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride 24 µg ml . The bFF was stored frozen at 20 The procedure for purification of inhibin consisted of 4 stages or steps. In the sections below, an outline of the procedure is described and details of the purification procedure are presented. The steps in the purification procedure are as follows The purification of inhibin was monitored by the bioassay method of Scott et al. Endocrinology bFF 50 100ml was diluted with 0.05M ammonium acetate pH 7.0 25 50 ml and centrifuged 12000 g x 30 min at 4 Void volume fractions A, B, C and D, Fig. 1 were combined and 25 50 of the pooled fractions were acidified with glacial acetic acid chromogen free to a final concentration of 4M acetic acid and kept at 4 The column fractions elution volume approximately 1760 1910 ml from Step B were pooled prior to loading onto the RP HPLC column. The column employed was an Ultrapore RPSC Beckman, Berkeley, California . The mobile phase used was a linear gradient between 0.1 TFA in water and 50 acetonitrile in 0.1 TFA the flow rate was 1 ml per minute and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. Three loading procedures were employed a the sample was lyophilised and 1 mg dissolved in 4M acetic acid to a concentration of 8 10 mg dry weight ml, centrifuged in approximately 100 µl 4M acetic acid and applied to the HPLC column via the injector b the lyophilised material 5 10 mg was dissolved in 20 ml of 4M acetic acid, centrifuged and loaded onto the column via a solvent port on the HPLC c the unlyophilised material approximately 100ml was filtered through a 0.5 µm filter FH Millipore Corp prior to loading via a solvent port on to the column at a flow rate of 2 ml minute. The inhibin regions from the bulk runs b and c were rechromatographed. Each fraction was combined with the contents of the corresponding tubes from the repeat runs if required and aliquots were taken for bioassay, amino acid analysis and SDS PAGE. The acetonitrile from each fraction was then removed by evaporation under N₂ and the sample lyophilised. As seen in Fig. 3, inhibin activity was found in one region of the chromatogram, corresponding to approximately 30 acetonitrile. The sample load in this experiment was 1 mg. Recoveries of inhibin of 40 were obtained with the various loading procedures, although the HPLC column performance was markedly influenced by the latter two procedures. A 10 fold increase in specific activity was attained with this HPLC step, with an overall 160 fold increase in specific activity. The inhibin containing fractions obtained by RP HPLC were dissolved in non reducing sample buffer 0.06 M Tris HCl pH 6.8, 12.5 glycerol, 1.25 w v SDS and 0.006 bromophenol blue and fractionated on a vertical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apparatus Reid and Bieleski, Analytical Biochemistry, The gels were electrophoresed initially at 20mA until the sample had migrated into the separating gel 1.5h , then the current was increased to 30mA for the duration of the run 4h until the bromophenol blue marker reached the bottom of the gel. The gel was stained with 0.5 Coomassie blue in acetic acid isopropyl alcohol water 1 3 6 v v 15 min and destained with acetic acid methanol water, 50 165 785 v v, and the inhibin region molecular weight approximately 56,000 which was visualised by this procedure was sectioned into 2 mm slices using a scalpel and ruler. Gel slices above and below the inhibin region were also taken. The gel slices were stored in sealed tubes at 15 to 20 Figure 4 shows reduced and non reduced SDS gel electrophoretic patterns of 4 sequential fractions A, B, C and D obtained by preparative PAGE purification. Inhibin activity was located primarily in fraction B apparent molecular weight 56,000 1,000 mean SD 5 purified inhibin preparations . Under reducing conditions, fraction B reduced into two major bands with apparent molecular weights of 44,000 3,000 The method used was modified from that of Hunkapiller et al. Methods in Enzymology, Using purification procedures based on the above methods, i.e. a combination of gel permeation chromatography, RP HPLC and preparative PAGE, inhibin activity was recovered as a single protein band on SDS PAGE Fig. 4 , with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 1,000 5 preparations . The purified preparations of inhibin suppress FSH but not luteinising hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone or prolactin in the Inhibin was isolated as in Example 1, except that it was precipitated by adjusting the pH of the void volume fraction from Step A to pH 4.75 with 4M acetic acid and centrifuging at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 Analytical SDS PAGE of the final product under non reducing conditions gave a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 56,000 1,000 mean SD, 5 preparations while under reducing conditions two major bands with apparent molecular weights of 44,000 3,000 and 14,000 2,000 5 preparations were observed. Evidence of heterogeneity was observed and assessed from electrophoresis of the 56kD band under non reducing conditions and the 44kD band under reducing conditions. The apparent molecular weight range for the 56kD material was between 54,000 and 57,000 while the 44kD material ranged from 42,000 to 46,000. A single band was observed with the 14kD band. These findings are consistent with the glycoprotein nature of this molecule. The pI values of intact inhibin and the larger sub unit were determined using the 2 dimensional PAGE system of O Farrell, P.H., J. Biol. Chem, Further evidence that inhibin is a glycoprotein was established by A purified preparation of inhibin was reduced and carboxymethylated and the two sub units, of apparent molecular weight 44,000 and 14,000 respectively, were separated by PAGE and recovered from the gel by an electroelution process as described in Step E, Example 1 above. The SDS was removed by methanol precipitation of inhibin, and the N terminal amino acid sequence determined. Experiments on small quantities of the sub units gave the following sequences in which some of the values are uncertain. 19 µg of inhibin purified as described above was dissolved in 600 µl of Dulbecco s Phosphate Buffer pH 7.4 and emulsified with an equal volume of an oil based adjuvant for example, Marcol 52 Montanide 888 in the ratio 9 1. Marcol 52 is a Trade Mark of Esso, and Montanide 888 is a Trade Mark of S.E.P.P.I.C., Paris . Two hundred µl was injected into each of four intramuscular sites and 200 µl injected subcutaneously into a rabbit. The animal was boosted six weeks later with 18 µg of purified inhibin, using the same injection procedure as above. The titre of antibody in the rabbit serum was assessed by its ability to bind to iodinated inhibin for details see below , or by its ability to neutralize inhibin activity During immunization, the rabbit increased its testicular volume from 3.0 to 3.5 ml, indicating that immunization against inhibin can increase gonadal weight, presumably by neutralization of endogenous inhibin, thus allowing FSH levels to rise. The week 8 antiserum from the rabbit, prepared as described above, was investigated for its ability to neutralize inhibin activity Purified preparations of inhibin were iodinated either by a mild chloramine T procedure or by using the Bolton Hunter reagent Bolton and Hunter, Biochem J. Crude extracts of bovine follicular fluid have previously been shown to inhibit ovulation. The inhibition can be competitively reversed with FSH L. Cummins, Ph.D.Thesis, 1983, University of New England Armidale . 5 7 day pregnant mice were given 1.5 µg inhibin subcutaneously at 9 am., followed by subcutaneous injection of 10 IU of HCG at 6.00 p.m. The following morning the number of ova in the ampulla of the Fallopian tube was counted. Inhibin administration significantly inhibited ovulation, as shown in Table 1. Purified inhibin and 100 µl bFF both resulted in significant inhibition of ovulation compared to the control p 0.01 and p 0.05 respectively by Wilcoxon s test . In Example 5 above, one rabbit was immunized, and boosted on two further occasions with purified inhibin. The antiserum so obtained neutralized inhibin activity in the It is expected that purified inhibin, as seen in the experiment below with bovine follicular fluid, should suppress circulating FSH within 4 8 hours of administration. Inhibin bovine follicular fluid was administered via the jugular vein into the circulation of 34 day old male rats which had been castrated 3 days earlier, and the levels of plasma FSH 5 hours later were determined by FSH radioimmunoassay. There was a significant dose dependent decrease in FSH associated with increasing doses of bovine follicular fluid. Results are shown in Table 3. We have found that inhibin activity from ovine follicular fluid is purified in a similar manner to bFF inhibin using purifications steps A, B and C above. Its characteristics following steps D and E are similar to those of bFF inhibin. By extension it is expected that purification steps A to E would be applicable to other mammalian inhibins including that from human. Since FSH is important in the stimulation of ovarian and testicular function, the main potential applications of purified inhibin lie in its ability to specifically inhibit FSH secretion, or in its use as an antigen such that immunization against inhibin will elicit antibodies capable of neutralizing endogenously occurring inhibin, thereby raising FSH levels. Many studies have been performed It will be clearly understood that the invention in its general aspects is not limited to the specific details referred to hereinabove. It will be understood that the following claims do not extend to the materials occurring naturally in their complex natural biological environment.
