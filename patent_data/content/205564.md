## Description
The present invention is directedto the expression of the DNA of Claim 1 and to the Erythropoietin hereinafter EPO is a circulatingglycoprotein, which stimulates erythrocyte formation inhigher organisms. See, Carnot et al, The life of human erythrocytes is about 120 days.Thus, about 1 120 of the total erythrocytes are destroyeddaily in the reticulo endothelial system. Concurrently, arelatively constant number of erythrocytes are produceddaily to maintain the level of erythrocytes at all times Guyton, Erythrocytes are produced by the maturation and differentiationof the erythroblasts in bone marrow, and EPO is afactor which acts on less differentiated cells and inducestheir differentiation to erythrocytes Guyton, EPO is a promising therapeutic agent for the clinicaltreatment of anemia or, in particular, renal anemia.Unfortunately, the use of EPO is not yet common in practicaltherapy due to its low availability. For EPO to be used as a therapeutic agent, considerationshould be given to possible antigenicity problems,and it is therefore preferable that EPO be prepared from araw material of human origin. For example, human blood orurine from patients suffering from aplastic anemia or likediseases who excrete large amounts of EPO may be employed.These raw materials however, are in limited supply. See,for example, White et al., The preparation of EPO products has generally been EPO can also be recovered from sheep blood plasma,and the separation of EPO from such blood plasma has providedsatisfactorily potent and stable water soluble preparations.See, Goldwasser, Thus, while EPO is a desirable therapeutic agent,conventional isolation and purification techniques, usedwith natural supply sources, are inadequate for the massproduction of this compound. Sugimoto et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,377,513 describeone method for the mass production of EPO comprising the The reported production by others of EPO using geneticengineering techniques had appeared in the trade literature.However, neither an enabling disclosure nor the chemicalnature of the product has yet been published. In contrast,the present application provides an enabling disclosure forthe mass production of proteins displaying the biologicalproperties of proteins displaying the biological propertiesof human EPO. It is also possible by such techniques toproduce proteins which may chemically differ from authentichuman EPO, yet manifest similar and in some cases improved properties. For convenience all such proteins displayingthe biological properties of human EPO may be referred tohereinafter as EPO whether or not chemically identicalthereto. The present invention is directed to the expression ofthe DNA of claim 1 that expresses surprisingly high levels of human EPO,and the mass production As described in greater detail The EPO gene was verified on the basis of its DNAsequence which matched many of the tryptic protein fragmentssequenced. A piece of the genomic clone was then used todemonstrate by hybridization that EPO mRNA could be detectedin human fetal 20 weeks old mRNA. A human fetal livercDNA library was prepared and screened. Three EPO cDNAclones were obtained after screening 750,000 recombinants .Two of these clones were determined to be full length asjudged by complete coding sequence and substantial 5 primeand 3 prime untranslated sequence. These cDNAs have beenexpressed in both SV 40 virus transformed monkey cells theCOS 1 cell line Gluzman, The EPO cDNA clone has an interesting open readingframe of 14 15 amino acids aa with initiator and terminatorfrom 20 to 30 nucleotides nt upstream of the coding region. A representative sample of The present invention is directed to the production of EPO by the The patent and scientific literature is replete withprocesses reportedly useful for the production of recombinantproducts. Generally, these techniques involve the isolationor synthesis of a desired gene sequence, and the expressionof that sequence in either a procaryotic or eucaryoticcell, using techniques commonly available to the skilledartisan. Once a given gene has been isolated, purified andinserted into a transfer vector i.e., cloned , its availabilityin substantial quantity is assured. The vectorwith its cloned gene is transferred to a suitable microorganismor cell line, for example, bacteria, yeast, mammaliancells such as, COS 1 monkey kidney , CHO Chinese hamsterovary , insect cell lines, and the like, wherein the vectorreplicates as the microorganism or cell line proliferatesand from which the vector can be isolated by conventionalmeans. Thus there is provided a continuously renewablesource of the gene for further manipulations, modificationsand transfers to other vectors or other loci within the samevector. Expression may often be obtained by transferring thecloned gene, in proper orientation and reading frame, intoan appropriate site in a transfer vector such that translationalread through from a procaryotic or eucaryotic generesults in synthesis of a protein precursor comprising theamino acid sequence coded by the cloned gene linked to Metor an amino terminal sequence from the procaryotic oreucaryotic gene. In other cases, the signals for transcriptionand translation initiation can be supplied by a suitablegenomic fragment of the cloned gene. A variety of specificprotein cleavage techniques may be used to cleave theprotein precursor, if produced, at a desired point so as to release the desired amino acid sequence, which may then bepurified by conventional means. In some cases, the proteincontaining the desired amino acid sequence is producedwithout the need for specific cleavage techniques and mayalso be released from the cells into the extracellulargrowth medium. Human EPO was purified to homogeneity from the urineof patients afflicted with aplastic anemia as described As used herein, arabic numbers in parentheses, 1 through 61 , are used to refer to publications that arelisted in numerical order at the end of this specification. Phage hybridizing to the 17mer were picked, pooled insmall groups and probed with the 14mer and 18mer pools.Phage hybridizing to the 17mer, 18mer and 14mer pools wereplaque purified and fragments were subcloned into M13 vectorsfor sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method of Positive confirmation that these two clones designatedherein, lambda HEPO1 and lambda HEPO2 are EPO genomicclones has been obtained by sequencing additional exonscontaining other tryptic fragment coding information. Northern Analysis 56 of human fetal 20 weeks old liver mRNA was conducted using a 95nt single stranded probeprepared from an M13 clone containing a portion of the 87bpexon described in Table 1. As illustrated in Figure 1, astrong signal could be detected in fetal liver mRNA. Theprecise identification of this band as EPO mRNA was achievedby using the same probe to screen a bacteriophage lambdacDNA library of the fetal liver mRNA 25 . Several hybridizingclones were obtained at a frequency of approximately 1positive per 250,000 recombinants screened. The completenucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for theseclones lambda HEPOFL13 and lambda HEPOFL8 are shown inTables 7 and 6. The EPO coding information is containedwithin 594nt in the 5 prime half of the cDNA, including avery hydrophobic 27 amino acid leader and the 166 aminoacid mature protein. The identification of the N terminus of the matureprotein was based on the N terminal sequence of the proteinsecreted in the urine of persons with aplastic anemia asillustrated herein Table 1 , and as published by Goldwasser 26 , Sue and Sytkowski 27 , and by Yangawa 21 . Whetherthis N terminus Ala Pro Pro Arg represents the actualN terminus found on EPO in circulation or whether somecleavage occurs in the kidney or urine is presently unknown. The amino acid sequences which are underlined inTables 2 and 3 indicate those tryptic fragments or theportion of the N terminus for which protein sequence informationwas obtained. The deduced amino acid sequence agreesprecisely with the tryptic fragments which have been sequenced,confirming that the isolated gene encodes human EPO. The relative positions of the DNA inserts of fourindependent human EPO genomic clones are shown in Figure3. Hybridization analysis of these cloned DNAs with oligonucleotideprobes and with various probes prepared from thetwo classes of EPO cDNA clones positioned the EPO genewithin the approximately 3.3 kb region shown by the darkenedline in Figure 3. Complete sequence analysis of thisregion see Example 4 and comparison with the cDNA clones,resulted in the map of the intron and exon structure of theEPO gene shown in Figure 4. The EPO gene is divided into 5exons. Part of exon I, all of exons II, III and IV, andpart of exon V, contain the protein coding information.The remainder of exons I and V encode the 5 prime and the3 prime untranslated sequences respectively. To demonstrate that biologically active EPO could beexpressed in an Twenty four hours after transfection of this constructinto the M6 strain of COS 1 cells Horowitz et al, Different vectors containing other promoters can alsobe used in COS cells or in other mammalian or eukaryoticcells. Examples of such other promoters useful in thepractice of this invention include SV40 early and latepromoters, the mouse metallothionein gene promoter, thepromoter found in the long terminal repeats of avian ormammalian retroviruses, the bacculovirus polyhedron genepromoter and others. Examples of other cell types usefulin the practice of this invention include An expression system which retains the benefits ofmammalian expression but requires less time to produce ahigh level expression cell line is composed of an insectcell line and a DNA virus which reproduces in this cellline. The virus is a nuclear polyhedrosis virus. It has adouble stranded circular DNA genome of 128 kb. The nucleocapsidis rod shaped and found packaged in two forms, thenon occluded form, a membrane budded virus and an occludedform, packaged in a protein crystal in the infected cellnucleus. These viruses can be routinely propagated in Because the PIB plays no role in the This system has been utilized by several researchersthe most noted being Pennock et al. and Smith et al.Pennock et al. Gregory D. Pennock, Charles Shoemaker, andLois K. Miller, Another nuclear polyhedrosis virus derived expressionvector has been presented by Smith et al. Gale E. Smith,Max D. Summers and M. J. Fraser, Examples of EPO expression in CHO, C127 and 3T3, andinsect cells are given in Examples 10 and 11 CHO , 13 C127and 3T3 and 14 insect cells . Recombinant EPO produced in CHO cells as in Example11 was purified by conventional column chromatographicmethods. The relative amounts of sugars present in theglycoprotein were analyzed by two independent methods i Reinhold, Methods in Enzymol. 50 244 249 Methanolysis and ii Takemoto, H. et al., Anal. Biochem. 145 245 1985 pyridyl amination, together with independent sialic aciddetermination . The results obtained by each of thesemethods were in excellent agreement. Several determinationswere thus made, yielding the following average values whereinN acetylglucosamine is, for comparative purposes, given avalue of 1 It is noteworthy that significant levels of fucose andN acetylgalactosamine were reproducibly observed using bothindependent methods of sugar analysis. The presence ofN acetylgalactosamine indicates the presence of O linkedglycosylation on the protein. The presence of O linkedglycosylation was further indicated by SDS PAGE analysisof the glycoprotein following digestion of the glycoproteinwith various combinations of glycosidic enzymes. In particular,following enzymatic removal of all N linked carbohydrate on the glycoproteins using the enzyme peptide endo F N glycosidase,the molecular weight of the protein was furtherreduced upon subsequent digestion with neuraminidase, asdetermined by SDS PAGE analysis. It is interesting to compare the glycoprotein characterizationpresented above with the characterization for arecombinant CHO produced EPO material previously reportedin International Patent Application Publication No. WO85 02610 published 20 June 1985 . The correspondingcomparative sugar analysis described on page 65 of thatapplication reported a value of zero for fucose and forN acetylgalactosamine and a hexoses N acetylgalactosamineratio of 15.09 1. The absence of N acetylgalactosamineindicates the absence of O linked glycosylation in thepreviously reported glycoprotein. In contrast to thatmaterial, the recombinant CHO produced EPO of this inventionwhich is characterized above contains significant andreproducibly observable amounts of both fucose and N acetylgalactosamine,contains less than one tenth the relativeamount of hexoses and is characterized by the presence ofO linked glycosylation. Furthermore, the high specificactivity of the above described CHO derived recombinant EPO of this invention may be directly related to its characteristicglycosylation pattern. The biologically active EPO produced by theeucaryotic expression of the cloned EPO DNAof claim 1 of the present invention can be used for the The active EPO may be administered by any routeappropriate to the condition being treated. Preferably,the EPO is injected into the bloodstream of the mammalbeing treated. It will be readily appreciated by thoseskilled in the art that the preferred route will vary withthe condition being treated. While it is possible for the active EPO to be administeredas the pure or substantially pure compound, it ispreferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation orpreparation. The formulations, both forveterinary and for human use, comprise an active EPO protein,as above described, together with one or more pharmaceuticallyacceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeuticingredients. The carrier s must be acceptable in thesense of being compatible with the other ingredients ofthe formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Desirably the formulation should not include oxidizingagents and other substances with which peptides are knownto be incompatible. The formulations may conveniently bepresented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any ofthe methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methodsinclude the step of bringing into association the activeingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or moreaccessory ingredients. In general, the formulations areprepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into associationthe active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely dividedsolid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping theproduct into the desired formulation. Formulations suitable for parenteral administrationconveniently comprise sterile aqueous solutions of theactive ingredient with solutions which are preferablyisotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulationsmay be conveniently prepared by dissolving solid activeingredient in water to produce an aqueous solution, andrendering said solution sterile may be presented in unit ormulti dose containers, for example sealed ampoules or vials.

The transformation vector was pAdD26SVpA 3 describedby Kaufman et al., pAdD26SVpA 3 was converted to plasmid pCVSVL2 asillustrated in Fig. 5A. pAdD26SVpA 3 was converted toplasmid pAdD26SVpA 3 d by the deletion of one of the twoPst1 sites in pAdD26SVpA 3 . This was accomplished by apartial digestion with Pst1 using a of enzymesuch that a subpopulation of linearized plasmids are obtainedin which only one Pst1 site was cleaved, followed by treatmentwith Klenow, ligation to recircularize, and screening fordeletion of the Pst1 site located 3 prime to the SV40polyadenylation sequence. The adenovirus tripartite leader and virus associatedgenes VA genes were inserted into pAdD26SVpA 3 d asillustrated in Fig. 5A. First, pAdD26SVpA 3 d was cleavedwith Pvull to make a linear molecule opened within the 3 prime portion of the three elements comprising the tripartiteleader. Then, pJAW 43 Zain et al., The Ava II D fragment of SV40 containing the SV40enhancer sequence was obtained by digesting SV40 DNA withAva II, blunting the ends with the Klenow fragment of PolI, ligating Xho 1 linkers to the fragments, digesting withXho 1 to open the Xho 1 site, and isolating the fourthlargest D fragment by gel electrophoresis. This fragmentwas then ligated to Xho 1 cut pTPL, yielding the plasmidpCVSVL2 TPL. The orientation of the SV40 D fragment inpCVSVL2 TPL was such that the SV40 late promoter was in thesame orientation as the adenovirus major late promoter. To introduce the adenovirus associated VA genesinto the pCVSVL2 TPL, first a plasmid pBR322 was constructedthat contained the adenovirus type 2 Hind III B fragment.Adenovirus type 2 DNA was digested with Hind III and the Bfragment was isolated by gel electrophoresis. This fragmentwas inserted into pBR322 which had previously been digestedwith Hind III. After transformation of As illustrated in Fig. 5B, the VA genes are convenientlyobtained from plasmid pBR322 Ad Hind III B by digestionwith Hpa I, adding EcoR1 linkers and digestion with EcoR1,followed by recovery of the 1.4kb fragment. The fragmenthaving EcoR1 sticky ends is then ligated into the EcoR1site of PTL, previously digested with EcoR1. After transforming As illustrated in Fig. 5C, the two EcoR1 sites inp91023 were removed by cutting p91023 to completion withEcoR1, generating two DNA fragments, one about 7kb and theother about 1.3kb. The latter fragment contained the VAgenes. The ends of both fragments were filled in using theKlenow fragment of PolI and the two fragments were thenligated together. A plasmid p91023 A , containing the VAgenes and similar to p91023, but deleted for the two EcoR1sites, were identified by Grunstein Hogness screening withthe Va gene fragment, and by conventional restriction siteanalysis. The single Pst1 site in p91023 A was removed andreplaced with an EcoR1 site. p91023 a was cut to completionwith Pst1 and treated with the Klenow fragment of PolI togenerate flush ends. EcoR1 linkers were ligated to theblunted Pst1 site of p91023 A . The linear p91023 A , withEcoR1 linkers attached at the blunted Pst1 site was separatedfrom unligated linkers and digested to completion with EcoR1, andreligated. A plasmid, p91023 B as depicted in Figure SC was recovered, and identified as having astructure similar to p91023 A , but with an EcoR1 site in place of the former Pst1 site. Plasmid p91023 B has been deposited and is available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland asAccession Number ATCC 39754. The cDNA clones lambda EPOFL6 and lambda EPOFL13 Example 3 were inserted into the plasmidp91023 B forming pPTFL6 and pPTFL13, rspectively. 8 ug of each of the purified DNA s was then used totransfect 5 x 10 Production of immunologically active EPO was quantified by a radioimmunoassay as described bySherwood and Goldwasser 55 . The antibody was provided by Dr. Judith Sherwood. The iodinated tracerwas prepared from the homogeneous EPO described in Example 1. The sensitivity of the assay isapproximately 1ng ml. The results are shown below in Table 8. PTFL13 has been deposited and is available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,Maryland under Accession No. ATCC 39990. EPO cDNA lambda HEPOFL13 was inserted into the p91023 B vector and was transfected into COS 1cells and harvested as described above Example 6 except that the chloroquin treatment was omitted. 180 ng of EPO released into the media of COS cells transfected with EPO The Bam HI PvuII fragment from the plasmid PSV2DHFR Subramani et al., The vector p91023 C was digested with XhoI to completionand the resulting linearized DNA with sticky endswas blunted by an end filling reaction with the largefragment of The Hind III Pvu II fragment from SV40 which containsthe SV40 origin or replication and the enhancer was insertedinto the plasmid c lac Little et al., DNA 20 ug from the plasmid pPTFL13 described above Example 6 was digested with the restriction endonucleaseCla I to linearize the plasmid and was ligated to ClaI digested DNA from the plasmid pAdD26SVp A 1 2 ug whichcontains an intact dihydrofolate reductase DHFR genedriven by an adenovirus major late promoter Kaufman andSharp, Stepwise methotrexate MTX selection was achieved by repeated cycles of culturing the cells in thepresence of increasing concentrations of methotrexate and selecting for survivors. At each round, EPO wasmeasured in the culture supernatant by RIA and by in vitro biological activity. The levels of methotrexateused in each stepwise amplification were 0.02 uM, 0.1 uM, and .5 uM. As shown in Table 10 after 1 roundof selection in .02 uM MTX significant levels of EPO were being released into the culture media. DNA from the clone lambda HEPOFL13 was digested with EcoRI and the small RI fragment containingthe EPO gene was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the plasmid RK1 4 See Example 10 . This DNA RKFL13 was then used to transfect the DHFR negative CHO cells directly without digestion and theselection and amplification was carried out as described in Example 10 above. The RKFL13 DNA was also inserted into CHO cells by protoplast fusion and microinjection. PlasmidRKFL13 has been deposited and is available from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,Maryland under Accession No. ATCC 39989. The preferred single colony clone has been deposited and is available from the American Type CultureCollection, Rockville, Maryland under Accession Number ATCC CRL8695. The vector used for expression of the EPO genomic clone is pSVOd Mellon et al., The plasmids CZ1 3 and CZ2 1 were transfected intoCOS 1 cells as described in Example 7 and media was harvestedand assayed for immunologically reactive EPO. Approximately31 ng ml of EPO was detected in the culture supernatantfrom CZ2 1 and 16 31 ng ml from CZ1 3. Genomic clones HEPO1, HEPO2, and HEPO6 can be insertedinto COS cells for expression in a similar manner. A plasmid containing the EPO cDNA sequence under thetranscriptional control of a mouse metallothionein promoterand linked to the complete bovine papilloma virus DNA wasprepared as follows The plasmid SP6 5 was purchased from Promega Biotec.This plasmid was digested to completion with EcoR1 and the1340 bp EcoR1 fragment from lambda HEPOFL13 was inserted byDNA ligase. A resulting plasmid in which the 5 end of theEPO gene was nearest to the SP6 promoter as determined byBglI and Hind III digestion was termed pEPO49F. In thisorientation, the BamHI site in the PSP6 5 polylinker isdirectly adjacent to the 5 end of the EPO gene. The plasmid pdBPV MMTneo 342 12 Law et al., pMMTneo BPV was digested to completion with BglII.pEPO49f was digested to completion with BamHI and BglII andthe approximately 700 bp fragment containing the entire EPOcoding region was prepared by gel isolation. The BglIIdigested pMMTneo BPV and the 700 bp BamHI BglII EPO fragmentwere ligated and resulting plasmids containing the EPO cDNAwere identified by colony hybridization with an oligonucleotided GGTCATCTGTCCCCTGTCC probe which is specific for theEPO gene. Of the plasmids which were positive by hybridizationanalysis, one pEPO15a which had the EPO cDNA inthe orientation such that the 5 end of the EPO cDNA wasnearest to the metallothionein promoter was identified bydigestion with EcoRI and KpnI. The plasmid pEPO15A was digested to completion withBamHI to linearize the plasmid. The plasmid pdBPV MMTneo 342 12 was also digested to completion with BamHI to producetwo fragments of 6.5 and 8kb . The 8kb fragment which containedthe entire Bovine Papilloma Virus genome, was gel isolated.pEPO15a BamHI and the 8kb BamHI fragment were ligatedtogether and a plasmid pBPV EPO which contained the BPVfragment was identified by colony hybridization using anoligonucleotide probe d P CCACACCCGGTACACA OH which isspecific for the BPV genome. Digestion of pBPV EPO DNAwith Hind III indicated that the direction of transcriptionof the BPV genome was the same as the direction of transcriptionfrom the metallothionein promoter as in pdBPV MMTneo 342 12 see Figure 8 . The plasmid pdBPV MMTneo 342 12 is available from the American Type Culture Collection,Rockville, Maryland under Accession No. ATCC 37224. The following methods were used to express EPO. DNA pBPV EPO was prepared and approximately 25 ug wasused to transfect 1x 10 C127 or 3T3 cells were cotransfected with 25ug ofpBPV EPO and 2ug of pSV2neo Southern et al., C127 cells were transfected with 30 ug of pBPV EPO asdescribed in Method I. Following transfection and splitting 1 10 , fresh media was exchanged every three days. Afterapproximately 2 weeks, foci of BPV transformed cells wereapparent. Individual foci were picked separately into 1cm wells of a microtiter plate, grown to a sub confluentmonolayer and assayed for EPO activity or antigenicity in theconditioned media. The plasmid vector pIVEV has been deposited and isavailable from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville,Maryland under Accession No. ATCC 39991. The vectorwas modified as follows pIVEV was digested with EcoRI to linearize the plasmid,blunted using the large fragment of DNA polymerase I and asingle NotI linker pIVEV was digested with SmaI to linearise the plasmidand a single SfiI linker The plasmid pIVEVSI was digested with KpnI to linearizethe plasmid and approximately 0 to 100 bp were removed fromeach end by digestion with the double stranded exonucleaseBal 31. Any resulting ends which were not perfectly bluntwere blunted using the large fragment of DNA polymerase Iand the polylinker pIVEVNI was digested to completion with KpnI and PstIto produce two fragments. The larger fragment, which containedthe plasmid origin of replication and the 3 end of thepolyhedron gene was prepared by gel isolation fragmentA . pIVEVSIBgKp was digested to completion with PstI andKpn to produce two fragments and the smaller fragment,which contained the polyhedron gene promoter and the polylinkerwas prepared by gel isolation fragment B . FragmentA and B were then joined by DNA ligase to form the newplasmid pIVEVSIBgKpNl which contains a partially deletedpolyhedron gene into which a polylinker has been insertedand also contains a NotI site replacing the destroyedEcoRI site and a SfiI site which flank the polyhedron generegion. pIVEVSI BGKpNI was digested to completion with EcoRIto linearize the plasmid and the 1340 bp EcoRI fragment fromlambda HEPOFL13 was inserted. Plasmids containing the EPOgene in the orientation such that the 5 end of the EPOgene is nearest to the polyhedron promoter and the 3 end ofthe polyhedron gene were identified by digestion with BglII.One of these plasmids in the orientation described abovewas designated pIVEPO. Large amounts of the pIVEPO plasmid were made bytransforming the These two DNAs were then cotransfected into COS cell conditioned media 121 with EPO concentrationsup to 200ug litre was concentrated to 600ml using 10,000molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration membranes, such asa Millipore Pellican fitted with 5 sq. ft. of membrane.Assays were performed by RIA as described in Example 6. Theretentate from the ultrafiltration was diafiltered against4ml. of 10mM sodium phosphate buffered at pH7.0. Theconcentrated and diafiltered condition media contained2.5mg of EPO in 380mg of total protein. The EPO solutionwas further concentrated to 186ml and the precipitatedproteins were removed by centrifugation at 110,000 xg for 30minutes. The supernatant which contained EPO 2.0mg wasadjusted to pH5.5 with 50 acetic acid, allowed to stirat 4 C for 30 minutes and the precipitate removed by centrifugation at 13,000 xg for 30 minutes. The supernatant from the centrifugation 20ml containing200ug of EPO 24mg total protein was applied to acolumn packed with CM Sepharose 20ml equilibrated in 10mMsodium acetate pH5.5, washed with 40ml of the same buffer.EPO which bound to the CM Sepharose was eluted with a 100mlgradient of NaU 0 1 in 10mM sodium phosphate pH5.5. Thefractions containing EPO total of 50ug in 2mg of totalproteins were pooled and concentrated to 2ml using AmiconYM10 ultrafiltration membrane. The concentrated fractions from CM Sepharose containingthe EPO was further purified by reverse phase HPLC usingVydac C 4 column. The EPO was applied onto the columnequilibrated in 10 solvent B Solvent A was 0.1 CF
