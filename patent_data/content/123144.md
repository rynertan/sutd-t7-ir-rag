# Polypropylene resin prefoamed particles.

## Abstract
Polypropylene resin prefoamed particles having a crystal structure characterized in that in a DSC curve obtained by heating 1 to 3 mg of the polypropylene resin prefoamed parti cles to 220 C at a heating rate of 10 C min with a differential scanning calorimeter, there appears a peak a characteristic peak characteristic of the polypropylene resin and another peak b high temperature peak at a higher temperature than a temperature at which the characteristic peak appears.
