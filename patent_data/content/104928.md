# Ultrasonic diagnostic imaging systems for varying depths of field.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic diagnostic imaging system is described in which a multi element transducer array transmits a focused beam of energy from the transducer elements. As the depths of focus is varied between near and far field focusing under operator control, the nominal frequency of the transmitted ultrasound energy is varied correspondingly by the system, from relatively high frequency transmission in the near field to relatively low frequency transmission in the far field.
