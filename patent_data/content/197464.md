# Deep pod nuclear reactor for district heating.

## Abstract
The deep pool nuclear reactor for district heating is a novel type of nuclear reactor technology for district heating purposes. This invention provides a design for a deep pool reactor with fairly high outlet water temperature which can meet the requirements of medium and small size district heat grids while retaining the simplicity, high inherent safety, and lower economic scale of pool type reactors. The depth of the reactor pool 6 is increased to keep the reactor core 14 under static pressure of pool water and the hot water enters the heat exchanger 5 from the bottom 17 to keep high saturation temperature of the reactor outlet 3 cooling water. The advantages of this design include simplicity in structure, better safety features, lower capital investment, easy operation and maintenance, the possibility of compre hensive utilization, and hence higher economic benefit.

## Description
Deep Pool Nuclear Reactor for District HeatingThis invention relates to a novel type of low temperature reactor for district heating and to the techniques of low temperature nuclear heat.Nuclear heat is considered an important new technology in meeting the future energy demand of the world. Three different types of low temperature heating reactors have been proposed 1. The pressurized shell type light water reactor e.g. the natural circulating slightly boiling water reactor designs of FRG and USSR in which the reactor cores are installed inside a pressure vessel and the internal structures are much like those of a standardLWR for power generation. See 06 ATO2X2.1 TenocHa6reHnn , , , . 224 228. 2. The pressurized pool type light water reactor e.g.the low pressure PWR design of Sweden in which the reactor core is installed inside a large pool within aPCRV. See L. Nilsson, M. Hannus SECURE NUCLEARDISTRICT HEATING PLANT , Nucl. Techn., Vol. 38 Both the above two designs are single purpose heating reactors for urban house heating. The economic scale of the above designs will be around 200 500 MW in order to compete with conventional energy sources. Since a 500MW heating reactor will be able to supply the base load of a heat grid covering some 10 million mÃª of buildings, such reactors could only De incorporated in large heat grids in big and medium sized cities.However, many smaller customers, e.g. small cities and towns as well as industrial areas, cannot benefit from such reactors due to high initial investment, which therefore hinders the penetration of such reactors into the heat generator market.In order to meet the demand of small customers, an open pool type heating reactor has been developed byChalk River Lab. of Canada see AECL 8257, the CanadianSlowpoke Heating Reactor, by J.S. Glen and J.W. Hiloorn . Tne features of such a reactor consist of the installation of the reactor core at the bottom of an open pool. Tne water heated by the reactor core flows upward under the buoyancy force and enters the heat exchanger near the top of tne pool, gives the heat to the secondary loop, and then returns to the bottom of the pool. Natural circulation is thus established. The structure of the reactor is very simple, and the inherent safety is guaranteed. It is reported that the operation cost of a 2 MW design is expected to compete with the oil fired boiler in the remote regions in Canada.However, due to the very low outlet temperature 700C of tne hot water to tne heat grid, it could not meet the requirements of ordinary medium and small sized heat grids in many countries, and hence is rather limited in application.The aim of this invention is to increase the temperature of the outlet hot water to the heat grid as well as benefit by tne comprehensive utilization of both heat and radiation, while still retaining the basic advantages of tne pool type reactor, and thus decrease the cost of nuclear heat.Tne main features of this invention are 1. An increase in the depth of the pool and mainten ance of the water level to at least 10 40 meters above the upper edge of the reactor core, thus in creasing the outlet temperature of reactor cooling water while avoiding boiling at the core.2. In order to prevent boiling after leaving the core, the 1st loop hot water enters the heat exchanger from the bottom and flows upward inside the heat exchanger, and the cooled 1st loop water leaves the heat exchanger near the top of the pool contrary to the Canadian design, etc. and natural circula tion is established as well.3. The buoyancy force is increased due to the increas ed depth of the pool, and is not influenced by the reverse direction of 1st loop water flow in the heat exchanger. A circulation pump may be added to the natural circulation circuit to enhance heat transfer and hence reduce the size and capital investment of heat exchangers and other equipment inside the pool. The power consumption of such a pump is rather low compared with other designs.4. The open pool arrangement facilitates the installa tion of irradiation channels as well as a radiation loop in which the activated material can be circu lated outside the reactor in a separate irradiation facility.5. The scope of utilization of low temperature nuclear heat can be extended to include not only house heating in cold seasons and the supply of domestic hot water, but also air conditioning in hot seasons and power generation when necessary. There is practically no limitation on the depth of tne pool, and the estimated outlet hot water temperatures from the 2nd loop to the heat grid against the depths of the pool are listed in the following table as examples. Depth of Water Meters Abosae the Upper Edge of Core 15 20 30 40 Temperature or Hot Water 80 85 85 93 93 102 103 110 Entering the Heat Grid OC The advantages of this invention over the existing alternative designs are 1. All the basic advantages of the pool type reactor are retained, i.e. the simplicity in reactor struc ture, the inherent safety, tne low capital cost and the convenience of operation and maintenance 2. An increase in the outlet temperature of hot water to tne heat grid, thus meeting the requirements of many medium and small heat grids. Tne output power of the reactor will no longer be restricted by the exceptionally low temperature of the original open pool type design, with the result that the generated neat becomes more economically viable.3. The easy application and comprehensive utilization of both heat and irradiation with an open pool design substantially increases the economic benefit of nuclear heat reactors and thus promotes their penetration into the heat generator market.An example of the application of such an invention is shown in the attached figure Fig. 1 of a 20 100 MW deep pool heat reactor design supplying the district heat needed by some 0.4 2 million square meters of buildings . The reactor core 14 is installed at the bottom of a large pool 6, in which hydraulically driven control rods 12 and 13 are inserted also with electromechanical control drive when the depth of water permits . The 1st loop water heated by the core flows upward through the duct 10 by means of the buoyancy force into the inlet 17 at tne bottom of heat exchanger 5.The heat is transferred to 2nd cooling water e.g.through tubebanks as shown with dotted lines , and then the 1st loop cooling water returns to the pool through the outlet 3 at the top of the heat exchanger. A circulation pump 4 may be installed as desired to enhance the output of the reactor. The 2nd loop cooling water enters the heat exchanger from the top 1 and passes through the heat transfer surfaces 5 and leaves the heat exchanger from the bottom 17, and then carries the heat to a 3rd loop i.e. the heat grid, not shown in the figure . The pressure of 2nd loop is kept higher than tnat of both 1st and 3rd loops to guarantee the radioactive 1st loop water will not leak into the 3rd loop under any circumstances. A platform for maintenance 8 is also shown in. the figure, and the maintainance and refueling work can be carried out easily after lowering the water level from the operation level 2 to maintenance level 9. At the same time, the residue heat of the core will be dissipated by the residue heat exchanger 11. The spent fuel may be temporarily stored in the spent fuel storage cage 15. Irradiation channels and loop 16 may be installed inside the reactor as a result of the open pool arrangement. The simplicity in structure and the convenience of operation and maintenance are easily seen from this figure. Another example of the extended application of this invention is A deep pool type reactor of 5 EJ is designed, the water level being 15 meters above the upper edge of the reactor core. The heat exchangers are 7 meters high. The hot water supply 850C, from 200C feed water is 60 tons hr in winter, and the refrigeration capability for air conditioning in summer with LiBr absorption refrigerator is 6 Gcal hr at 7 120C chilling water temperature. A saving of power equivalent to 0.45 million yuanRMB is estimated in comparison with a conventional vapor compressor air conditioning unit, based on an annual availability of 4300 hr. In addition, an irradiation loop is designed in this reactor which can provide a radiation source equivalent to 200,000 Ci Co in a separate irradiation facility. Both the technologies of refrigeration and irradiation themselves are either conventional or separately developed technologies not included in this invention.It will be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein but that it may be modified within the scope of the appended claims.
