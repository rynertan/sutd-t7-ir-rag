## Description
FLAVOR ENHANCING SEASOINC,.S AND FOODS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to seasoning and food having enhanced flavor by the addition of sulfurcontaining compounds. The taste intensity imparting function of representative Umami substances, namely, sodiumL glutamate MSG , sodium 5 inosinate IMP and sodium 5 guanylate GMP is widely known. A wide variety of seasonings obtained from MSG, IMP and GMP can be appropriately combined with protein hydrolysates HVP,HAP , yeast extract YE , amino acids etc. In their various application, these substances have been increasingly used for the purpose of enhancing organoleptic characteristics of foods such as the Umami MSG like taste flavor etc. Although Umami substances enjoy popularity and wide application, there has still been a demand for extending their function to further develop their flavor characteristics. More specifically, there has still been a demand to further develop the thickness, amplitude, continuity etc. of Umami substances. This is a property which is different from their taste which is the effect achieved by a combination of saltiness, sweetness, acid taste etc. as is done to further enhance a taste. Hence, throughout this text the term taste is used to describe the basic saltiness, sweetness and acidity properties of the Umami substances described above.The term flavor is used to describe the thickness, amplitude and continuity properties of Umami substances. The terms taste and flavor do not describe the same properties. Rather they describe different properties which can be complementary. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, one object of this invention is to provide a novel enhanced flavor seasoning and foods containing it. The present inventors have discovered that 1 glutathione GSH and oxidized glutathione GSSG hereinafter called generically as GSH , 2 glutathione sulfonic acid GSo3H , 3 cycloallin hereinafter called CA , 4 lentinic acid, des glutamyl lentinic acid and the salts thereof hereinafter called generically as LA , 5 methionine methyl sulfonium MMS , and 6 compound of the following general formula 1 or 2 EMI3.1 wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 3 carbon atoms or a carboxyalkyl group wherein the alkyl group is from C1 to C6, R is H or a carboxymethylamino group, and R is H or a y glutamyl group, have flavor intensifying properties. As the result of further detailed investigations on taste and flavor intensity, it has been discovered that these compounds manifest strong flavor enhancement in the presence of MSG, a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance or a mixture thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Glutathione GSH , oxidized glutathione GSSG glutathione sulfonic acid GS03H , cycloallin CA , lentinic acid and des glutamyl lentinic acid both hereinafter generically referred to as LA and methionine methyl sulfonium MMS have been confirmed to be widely present in foods, natural products etc. Part of compounds 1 and 2 shown above were known as precursor substances for specific taste components in food in which these are present. Other parts of compounds 1 and 2 are presumed to be present in the metabolism route in foods, but no reference has been made to their relation to flavor intensity. Further, it is impossible to guess what flavor intensifying function these compounds manifest in the presence of the Umami components. It has now been discovered that GSH, GSSG, GSO3H, CA, LA, MMS and compounds of the general formulae 1 and 2 shown belowEMI4.1 wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a carboxyalkyl group wherein the alkyl group is from C to C6, R is H or a carboxymethylamino group, and R is H or a y glutamyl group manifest strong flavor enhancement in the presence ofMSG, a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance or a mixture thereof.As the result of a detailed study on various combinations and formulations of glutamic acid, glutamic acid salts or nucleic acid type taste intensifying substances with CA , GSH , GSO3H , LA or MMS , it has been discovered that these sulfur containing compounds are widely effective in the enhancement of flavor. Their discovery thus provides the possibility for novel flavor enhancing seasonings and foods by incorporating together Umami components and the sulfur containing compounds. The present invention relates to such combinations. GSH has been studied for its physiological activity, pharmacological efficacy etc. It has been used as e.g. a liver disease treating agent1 an antipyretic etc. Various applications of GSH to foods are also known. Some of these applications are given below. 1 GSH has been added to dough products of e.g., flour etc. as the so called amino acid type, reducing agent like cysteine etc. See Japanese PatentPublication Nos. 19863 1974, 16418 1975, 1773 1976, 9019 1976, 33981 1976, 9893 1981, Japanese PatentApplication Laid open Nos. 11967 1972, 30855 1972, 98052 1973, 122762 1979, 23853 1981 etc. 2 Similarly, GSH has been added to sour milk and baby foods as a storage stabilizer for vitamin C. SeeJapanese Patent Publication Nos. 7143 1975 and 21606 1970. 3 GSH has been added to fish paste products such as boiled fish taste as a decomposition inhibitor for nucleic acid type taste intensifying substances. See Japanese Patent Publication No. 8694 1968. 4 GSH has been added as an agent to relieve the yeast odor of yeast extract. See Japanese Patent Publication No. 6232 1969. 5 GSH has been used for the purpose of preventing the discoloration of canned fruit. See Japanese Patent Publication No. 20655 1965. 6 It has been used to intensify the flavor of foods, especially canned meat by being combined with sugar, amino acids etc. by reaction. See Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 22194 1967, 35149 1974, 28977 1978 etc. 7 It has been used to intensify cheese flavor. See Japanese PatentPublication No. 25024 1978 and the like. In these examples of applications of CSH to foods,GSH is used as a physical property modifier as in above 1 . In 4 , 6 and 7 etc. above, there are no comments regarding the taste intensity of GSH. Furthermore, the amounts of GSH added are only extremely small amounts. For example, only 0.01 to 0.05 GSH is added in the case of dough products, 0.001 to 0.02 in the case of baby foods.Even in the case of taste intensification in meats or cheeses as in 6 or 7 above , a similarly extremely small amount is added. Therefore, it is clear from the above examples that there has been no finding in the prior art of GSH actually having a flavor intensifying function. Moreover, it is entirely impossible to know or predict what flavor intensifying function, if any,GSH would manifest in the presence of other taste components. GSO3H is known as a component in enokidake. Its presence has also been confirmed in a part of other mushrooms. The significance of its presence or its role in food have not yet been described. There is no reference in the prior art concerning the taste intensity of GSO3H. Further it is entirely impossible to know or predict what flavor intensifying functions, if any, GS03H manifests in the presence of the Umami components. Lentinic acid is contained in shiitake and is known as a precursor to the odor of shiitake. When shiitake tissue is damaged or dried shiitake is reconstituted with water, it undergoes various chemical and or biochemical reactions e.g., enzymatic action by y glutamyl transferase, C S lyase etc. Resultingly lenthionine which is an odorous principle of shiitake is formed. In none of the above described research was there any mention suggesting the flavor intensity of lentinic acid. Further, it is entirely impossible to know or predict what flavor intensifying functions, if any, lentinic acid manifests in the presence of the Umami components. MMS is also known as vitamin U. It has been intensively investigated for its pharmacological efficacy and has been used as e.g. an antiulcer agent. Various applications of MMS in foods are also known. Some of these applications are given below. 1 MMS has been used also for the purpose of intensifying and modifying the taste of food by adding it as a so called taste precursor substance to the food and subsequently converting it into a taste substance by heating. See Japanese Patent Application Laid openNo. 92663 1979 etc. 2 MMS has been used for the purpose of enhancing the nutritional value of soybean paste, bean milk etc. See Japanese Patent PublicationNos. 19827 1968 and 13979 1974. 3 It is used as an antioxidant for oils and fats. See Japanese PatentPublication No. 1125 1975. 4 And it is used for the purpose of preventing the decomposition of vitaminB1. In this use it is incorporated in compositions to which sulfurous acid has been added to serve as a deterioration inhibitor e.g., medicines, foods etc. See Japanese Patent Publication No. 6153 1963. There has been no disclosure relating to the flavor intensity of MMS in any of these application.Further, it is entirely impossible to guess or predict what flavor intensifying function, if any, MMS manifests in the presence of the Umami components. Cycloallin is also known as imino acid. It is a sulfur containing component in onion and garlic. There are only few studies of its characteristics. It is known that cycloallin is formed by reaction of spropenylcysteinsulfoxide which is contained in 3 by wt. as a dry matter in onion. In none of the research relating to cycloallin, described above, are there any remarks of the flavor intensity of cycloallin.Further, it is entirely impossible to know or predict what flavor intensifying functions, if any, cycloallin manifests in the presence of the wUmamiZ components. In accordance with the present invention, a characteristic flavor intensity enhancing effect can be obtained by using GSH , GSO3H, CA LA and or MMS in combination with conventionally known Umami compounds such as MSG, IMP, GMP etc. The present invention further provides that these combinations are made in accordance with specified ratios. This invention relates to the intensification of the impression of taste flavor enhancement and to further impart flavor. Flavor here is the continuity, amplitude, thickness, etc. of the original taste Umami 1 bitterness, sweetness, acid taste, saltiness etc. while the original taste remains unchanged. The mixing ratio of the Umami component to the sulfur containing component selected from the group consisting of GSH , GS03H, CA , LA an.MMS may be determined as follows. The amount of the sulfur containing compound or compounds added is within the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight based on the weight of the present Umami component. The Umami component is calculated as the weight of MSG required to manifest the same Umami strength. All comparisons are made to the Umami strength of MSG. When a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance such as IMP, GMP etc. is used alone, the mixing ratio of sulfur containing compound or compounds is 1 99 to 99 .1. For example, in the case where the Umami component comprises only MSG, the sulfur containing compound or compounds are present at a concentration of 0.001 to 10 times that of MSG. In the other case, i.e. where MSG and IMP or GMP are also present as the Umami components, the Umami strength y value may be determined according to the following equations IMP y u 1218 uv GMP y u 2800 uv wherein u MSG concentration , and v IMP or GMP concentration t . While the conversion equation to obtain each y value can vary depending on the kinds and number of the tastiness components etc., the conversion equation established by organoleptically comparison with a simple aqueous solution of MSG may be appropriately used. For instance, the y value where IMP and GMP are used in combination at a ratio of 50 50 is as follows y u 2010 uv wherein u MSG concentration , and v IMP GMP mixture concentration . In this invention a characteristic flavor enhancing effect can also be obtained by using the compounds of the general formulae 1 and 2 shown below either singly or as a mixture.EMI11.1 wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or a carboxyalkyl group wherein the alkyl group is from C1 to C6, R is H or a carboxymethylamino group, and R is H or a y glutamyl group. The compounds of general formulae 1 and 2 are used in an amount falling in a specified ratio to the Umami components such as MSG, IMP, GMP etc. The effect in this case is to intensify the impression of the taste and further impart flavor to further develop the continuity, amplitude, thickness etc. The flavor thus obtained is characterized by that the original taste Umami bitterness, sweetness, acid taste, saltiness etc. remains unchanged. The mixing ratio of the Umami component to these compounds may be determined as follows. The amount of compound 1 or 2 or combination thereof added is 0.1 to 1000 by weight based on the weight of the also present Umami component. The weight of the also present Umami component is calculated as the weight of, e.g. MSG, required to manifest the same Umami strength. When a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance such as IMP, GMP etc. are used alone, the mixing ratio of these to compounds 1 or 2 or combination thereof is in the range of 1 99 to 99 1.In other words, in the case where the Umami component comprises only MSG, compound 1 or 2 or combination thereof are present in an amount of 0.001 to 10 times the concentration of MSG. In the other case, i.e., where MSG and IMP or GMP are present as the Umami components, the Umami strength y value may be determined according to the following equations IMP y u 1218 uv GMP y u 2800 uv wherein u MSG concentration , and v IMP or GMP concentration . While the conversion equation to obtain each y value can vary depending on the kinds and number of the Umami components etc., y values established by organoleptic comparison against a simple aqueous solution of MSG may be appropriately used. For instance, the y value where IMP and GMP are used in combination at a ratio of 50 50 is as follows y u 2010 uv wherein u MSG concentration , and v IMP GMP mixture concentration 8 . The compounds of formulae 1 and 2 can also be used in combination with any of the other sulfurcontaining compounds CSH , GS03HI nCA LA andMMS. Other features of the invention will become apparent in the course of the following descriptions of exemplary embodiments which are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof. Experimental Example 1 Evaluation in Simple Aqueous Solution Systems Using as a control a mixed aqueous solution of 0.05 g dl of MSG and 0.05 g dl of IMP y value 3.09 , sample solutions were prepared by adding 0.001 to 0.5 g dl of GSH to the mixed aqueous solution. These sample solutions were organoleptically evaluated by paired comparison tests against the control using an organoleptic panel of 20 members N 20 . The results are given in Table 1.

As shown in Table 1, with less than 0.1 of GSH added, based on the y value MSG calculated amount , the strength of flavor is comparable to that of the control. But by the addition of 0.1 or more of GSH, the flavor alone is remarkably increased without changing the strength of Umami and other basic tastes. If the absolute concentration of GSH exceeds 1.0 , specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost. Therefore, the amount ofGSH added should suitably be in the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 by weight, based on the weight of the also present tastiness component.Where the amount of tastiness component used is calculated as the weight of MSG having the same Umami strength. See equations above. Further, GSH manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above Umami component, that is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating. On the other hand, in the case where the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance such as IMP, GMP etc. is used alone, if GSH is added at a ratio of less than 1 99 to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancing effect is not adequate. Further when GSH is present in an amount of 250 wt. or more based on the amount of nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, GSH manifests the most preferred effect. Whereas if GSH exceeds a ratio of 99 1, a specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. Experimental Example 2 Evaluation in Beef Extract Systems According to the analytical values of beef extract, the effect of the addition of GSH to a formulation of major components was evaluated by paired comparison test against a control. The results are given in Table 3, from which it has been confirmed that in the synthetic beef extract as well, GSH imparts a higher natural taste by manifesting a strong flavor enhancement.

Experimental Example 3 Evaluation in Shrimp Extract Systems According to the analytical values of the extract components of shrimp which is a natural delicious food, the major components were formulated and organoleptically evaluated similarly as in Experiment Example 2.These tests confirm, as shown in Table 5, that GSH imparted a higher natural taste by manifesting a strong flavor enhancement as it did in beef extract tests.

If the absolute concentration of GS03H exceeds 1.0 , specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost. Therefore, the amount of GS03H added should suitably be in the range of p.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 by weight, based on the weight of co present Umami component. The amount of Umami component used is calculated as the weight of MSG having the same Umami strength. See equations. Further, GS03H manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above Umami component, that is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating. On the other hand, if the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance is used alone and GS03H is added at a ratio of less than 1 99 relative to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancing effect is not adequate. Whereas if this ratio exceeds 99 1, a specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. Experimental Example 5 Evaluation in Simple Aqueous Solution Systems A mixed aqueous solution of 0.05 g dl of MSG and 0.05 g dl of IMP y value 3.09 was used as a control. Sample solutions were prepared by adding 0.002 to 1.0 g dl of lentinic acid or des glutamyl lentinic acid LA to the mixed aqueous solution. These sample solutions were organoleptically evaluated by paired comparison against the control using an organoleptic panel of 20 members N 20 . The results are given in Table 7.

If the absolute concentration of lentinic acid or des glutamyl lentinic acid exceeds 1.0 , specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost.Therefore, the amount of LA added should suitably be in the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 by weight, based on the weight of co present tastiness component calculated as the weight of MSG having the same Umami strength. Further, LA manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above Umami component.That is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating. On the other hand, in the case where a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance such as IMP, GMP etc. is used alone, if LA is added at a ratio of less than 1 99 to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancing effect is not adequate. Whereas if this ratio exceeds 99 1, a specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. Experimental Example 6 Evaluation in Simple Aqueous Solution Systems A mixed aqueous solution of 0.05 g dl of MSG and 0.05 g dl of IMP y value 3.09 was used as a control. Sample solutions were prepared 1 by adding 0.001 to 1.0 g dl of MMS to the mixed aqueous solution, and 2 by mixing aqueous solutions of 0.1 g dl of IMP and 0.1 g dl of MMS. These sample solutions were organoleptically evaluated by paired comparison test against the control using an organoleptic panel of 20 members N 20 . The results are given in Table 8.

If the concentration of MMS exceeds 1.0 , a characteristic aroma or specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost. Therefore, the amount of MMS added should suitably be in the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 by weight, based on the weight of also present wUmamiw component. The amount of Umami component used is calculated as the weight of MSG having the same Umami1 strength. See equations. Further, MMS manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above Umami component.That is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating. On the other hand, when a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance such as IMP, GMP etc. is used alone, if MMS is added at a ratio of less than 1 99 to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancement as well as the characteristic sweetness enhancing effect is not adequate. Whereas if the ratio exceeds 99 1, a characteristic sweetness or specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. Experimental Example 7 Evaluation in Onion Extract Systems According to the analytical values of the onion extract, the effect of the addition of MMS to the formulation of major components was evaluated by a paired comparison test against a control case. The results are given in Table 10, from which it has been found that MMS imparts clear vegetable characteristic sweetness and strong flavor enhancement and gives a natural feel.

If the absolute concentration of cycloallin exceeds 2.0 , specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost.Therefore, the amount of allin added should suitably be in the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 50 by weight, based on the weight of co present Umami component calculated as the weight of MSG having the same Umami strength. Further, cycloallin manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above Umami component.That is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating. On the other hand, when a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance is used alone, if cycloallin is added at a ratio of less than 1 99 to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancing effect is not adequate. Whereas if the ratio exceeds 99 1, specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. GSH or GS03H in this invention may be that produced by any process1 e.g., a fermentation process, an enzymatic process, a chemical synthetic process or mixtures thereof, etc. Further, it is also possible to replace the whole or part of the amount of the requiredGSH by a substance containing GSH at a relatively high concentration such as yeast extract, garlic extract, beef extract, chicken extract etc. The same may be done with GSO3H where a substance containing GS03H at a relatively high concentration, such as enokidake extract, is used. Lentinic acid in this invention may be obtained from shiitake as is well known in the art, e.g. by extraction with alcohol, extraction with hot water, etc. Further, it is also possible to replace the whole or part of lentinic acid by an intermediate obtained by such extraction. Cycloallin in this invention may be obtained from onion or garlic as is well known in the art, e.g. by extraction with alcohol, extraction with hot water, etc. Further, it is also possible to replace the whole or part of cycloallin by an intermediate, end product1 or a chemical or enzymatic reaction product of the extract containing the precursor. Similarly, as regards the glutamic acid, nucleic acid type taste intensifying substances and other Umami components, the whole or part of said Umami components may be replaced by such Umami components as contained in foods and seasonings per se to which the sulfur containing compound or compounds are to be added. The Umami components used in combination with the sulfur containing compounds in this invention include, in addition to MSG, IMP and GMP, any component having a Umami imparting effect. For example, potassium glutamate, calcium glutamate, potassium 5 inosinate, calcium 5 inosinate, potassium 5 guanylate, calcium 5 guanylate etc. and any food or seasoning which contains at least one tastiness component as one of its constituents. For example,HAP, HVP, yeast extract, meat extract, fish extract, vegetable extract etc. may be used. The flavor enhancement seasonings of this invention may be prepared by any process. For example, the seasonings may be prepared by merely dry blendingMSG, IMP, GMP etc. with these compounds by pelletizing them together with an appropriate excipients, etc.Similarly, with regards to the production of food having enhanced flavor in accordance with this invention, the actual manner for the production is not limited as long as the Umasi compounds and the sulfur containing compound or compounds are co present in the final product at the above described mixing ratio. In addition, it is needless to say that the use in combination of various seasonings, for example, salty taste agents such as table salt, potassium chloride etc., sweetening agents such as sugar etc., acid taste agents such as organic acids etc., flavors, spices, physical property modifiers etc. is possible unless it departs from the object of this invention. The seasoning or food of this invention manifests a strong tastiness enhancement as is the case when seasoned with e.g. MSG, IMP, GMP etc. The quality of these seasonings is refreshing but, differing from the seasoning effect characterized by such strong single taste as simple taste. This quality exerts a specific effect permitting the enhancement of only the flavor without changing the Umami strength and the original taste such as saltiness, sweetness and the like. The seasoning or food of the present invention are characterized by the impartation of a complex natural taste. Therefore the seasonings of the present invention provide a novel flavor enhancement seasoning having a high natural taste in the compound seasoning field. This invention is more particularly described by the following examples.Example 1 Formulation of Flavor Enhancement Seasoning A MSG 80 parts by weight GSH 20 Formulation of Flavor Enhancement Seasoning B MSG 75 parts by weight IMP 5 H GSH 20 Formulation of Flavor Enhancement Seasoning C MSG 50 parts by weight GMP 10 GSH 40 Formulation of Flavor Enhancement Seasoning D MSG 80 parts by weight IMP 3 GMP 3 GSH 14 Formulation of Flavor Enhancement Seasoning D1 IMP 30 parts by weight GMP 30 GSH 40 Flavor Enhancement Seasonings A to D1 were prepared by mixing the respective compounds according to the above formulations.

These sample solutions were then organoleptically evaluated by paired comparison test against the control using an organoleptic panel of 20 members N 20 . The results are given in Table 5.1.

But by the addition of 0.1 or more, the flavor alone is remarkably increased without changing the strength of Umami .If the absolute concentration of alliin exceeds 1.0 , a specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost. Therefore, the amount of alliin added should suitably be in the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 500 by weight, based on the weight of co present component calculated as the weight of MSG having the same Umami strength.Further, alliin manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above IUmami component, that is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating. When a nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance is used alone, if alliin is added at a ratio of less than 1 99 to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancing effect is not adequate. Whereas if this ratio exceeds 99 1, specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. Experimental Example 10 Evaluation in Garlic Extract Systems The effect of the addition of alliin to a formulation of major components of garlic extract was evaluated by paired comparison test against a control which contained no alliin. The results are given inTable 53, from which it has been confirmed that alliin imparts a higher natural taste by the manifestation of strong flavor with synthetic garlic extract.

However, with the addition of 0.1 or more, the flavor is remarkably increased.In this case, if the absolute concentration of this compound compound No. 16 of ExperimentalExample 11 exceeds 1.0 , specific thickness in taste is manifested and the total taste balance is lost.Therefore, the amount of this compound added should suitably be in the range of 0.1 to 1000 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 508 by weight, based on the copresent Umami component calculated as the weight ofMSG having the same Umami strength. Further, the compound manifests the most preferred effect in the presence of an appropriate amount of the above Umami1 component, that is, when the above y value is 0.1 to 30 as the concentration at the time of eating.The above fact likewise applies to the other compounds of the general formulae 1 and 2 . On the other hand, in the case where the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance is used alone, if compound 1 or 2 is added in an amount of less than 1 99 at the ratio to the nucleic acid type taste intensifying substance, the flavor enhancing effect is not adequate. Whereas if this ratio exceeds 99 1, a specific thickness in taste is brought about and the total taste balance is lost. This also applies to the other compounds of the general formulae 1 and 2 .Experimental Example 13 Evaluation in Garlic Extract Systems Each compound set forth in Table 54 was added to a formulation comprising major components of garlic extract set forth in Table 55 . The compositions were evaluated by a paired comparison test using a control which contained no addition of compounds of Table 54.The results are given in Table 57 from which it has been confirmed that also in the formulated garlic extract, these compounds impart a higher natural flavor.

Examples of the Umami component which may be used in this invention include, in addition to MSG,IMP, GMP etc., any component having a Umami imparting effect. Some of these are potassium glutamate, calcium glutamate, potassium 5 inosinate, calcium 5 inosinate, potassium 5 guanylate, calcium 5 guanylate etc. and any food or seasoning which contains said Vmami components as one of its constituting components for example, protein hydrolysates HAP1 HVP , yeast extract, meat extract, vegetable extract etc. The Flavor Enhancing seasonings of this invention may be prepared by any process, for example, by merely dry blending MSG, IMP, GMP etc. with these compounds by pelletizing them using an appropriate excipient, etc.Similarly, for the production of food having enhanced flavor according to this invention, the actual manner for the production of the food is not limited as along as the Umami components and these compounds are copresent in the final product at the above described mixing ratio. In addition, it is needless to say that the use in combination of seasonings, for example, salty taste agents such as table salt, potassium chloride etc., sweetening agents such as sugar etc., acid taste agents such as organic acids etc., flavors, spices, quality modifiers etc. may be possible unless it departs from the object of this invention. This invention is more particularly described by the following examples.
