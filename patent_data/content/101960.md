# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having a self aligned gate electrode.

## Abstract
In manufacturing a field effect transistor, a pattern which has a wider upper layer 11, 18 and a narrower lower layer 12, 19 is formed at a gate electrode position. Using the pattern as a mask, first 2 and second 3 impurity regions are formed on both the sides of a gate region 4 by ion implantation. Subsequently, at least the lower layer 12, 15 is buried in a material 13, 16 , such as an organic high polymer material, having a selectivity in etching characteris tics with respect to the pattern material. After removing the lower layer 12, 19 , an electrode material 15, 71 is embedded in the resulting hole 14 so as to form a gate electrode 7, 81 .
