# SADDLE SHAPED CABLE DOME SYSTEM FOR LARGE SPAN LIGHTWEIGHT ROOF STRUCTURES

## Abstract
Disclosed is a shelter structure using a saddle shaped cable dome system for a large span, lightweight roof membrane. The structure uses the curvatures of a saddle surface, combined with two orthogonal cable nets separated by a set of compression struts, to create an efficient structural system confined by an edge ring loaded primarily in compression.
