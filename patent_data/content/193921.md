# Method for producing multi core optical fiber.

## Abstract
A mutli core optical fiber with improved dimensional accuracy is produced by a method comprising inserting at least two core glass rods 3 in bores formed in a cladding glass rod 1 having a refractive index lower than that of the core glass rods 3 to be inserted, heating a composite of the cladding glass rod 1 and the core glass rods 3 to inte grate them together, and drawing the integrated composite 4 to fabricate a multi core optical fiber. The drawing may be carried out simultaneously with the integration step.
