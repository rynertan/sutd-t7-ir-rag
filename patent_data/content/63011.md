# TEST EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
Equipment is provided to test an electrical device, e.g. solenoid, heater etc that effects an operation, e.g. movement of a valve, heating etc. To perform a test, the equipment actuates the device to cause the operation to commence. When the operation has proceeded to a predetermined extent, or after a predetermined time, whichever occurs first, a signal is produced which causes de actuation of the device thus stopping the operation. A signal is also produced to indicate whether it was the elapse of the specified time or the operation proceeding to the specified extent that caused de activation. The equipment is particularly suited for testing a device forming part of a trip system.
