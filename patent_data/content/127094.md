# Active suspension apparatus.

## Abstract
An active suspension apparatus detects a relative dis placement x between an axle and a vehicle body, discrimi nates a road surface state in accordance with the relative displacement and a change rate x in unit time which is derived from the relative displacement x , and optimally con trols characteristics of damping forces of hydropneumatic suspensions in accordance with a discrimination result i.e., a road surface state . This discrimination is performed in accor dance with a sum Ax Bx of a signal obtained by multiply ing the relative displacement x with a predetermined coeffi cient and a signal obtained by multiplying the change rate x with another predetermined coefficient. These coefficients are obtained in accordance with riding comfort against vibra tions. The characteristics of the damping force of the hydrop neumatic suspension are controlled by controlling the open ing of throttle valves disposed between hydropneumatic chambers and actuators.
