# Optical appparatus for interrogation of the status of a switch.

## Abstract
Apparatus for interrogating the ON OFF status of an electri cal switch 31 comprises a semiconductor body 4 containing a PN junction and means 5 for electrically connecting an auxiliary switch 32 couplet to the interrogated switch, or alternately the interrogated switch 32 itself, across the PN junction. Light 7 of a first wavelength incident on the semiconductor body causes light of a second wavelength 11 to be emitted from the body when the switch is open OFF , whereas no such light is emitted from the body when the switch is closed ON . Therefore, photoelectric detection of the emission or non emission of light of the second wavelength from the semiconductor body indicates the status of the switch.
