# Method for testing snubbers in situ and a snubber system for use in the method.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the testing of seismic shock absorbing snubbers 20 in situ. Such snubbers are used in power plants in association with piping that is yieldably attached by way of pipe hangers 6 to the plant building structure 4, 26 and permit free motion of the pipe 2 in response to slow thermal expansion or contraction of the pipe, but resist or damp rapid motion of the pipe induced by seismic shock or vibration. In a method aspect of the inven tion, the snubber system permits testing in situ by loosening, but not disconnecting, a connection 33 between the snubber and the pipe or, alternatively, between the snubber 20 and the support structure 26 to permit limited motion between two relatively movable sections 28, 30 of the snubber, with out inducing movement of the adjacent pipe then applying a test force between the relatively movable sections of the snubber to cause relative movement therebetween to deter mine the operation of the snubber.
