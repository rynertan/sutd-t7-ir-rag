# Zeolite EU 1.

## Abstract
A new zeolite material designated EU 1 having a molar composition expressed by the formula 0.5 to 1.5 R₂O Y₂O₃ at least 10 XO₂ 0 to 100 H₂O wherein R is a monovalent cation or ¹ n of a cation of valency n, X is silicon and or germanium, Y is one or more of aluminium, iron, gallium or boron, and H₂O is water of hydration additional to water notionally present when R is H, and having an X ray pattern substantially as set out in Tables 1 and 2 is prepared from a reaction mixture containing XO₂ preferably silica , Y₂O₃ prefer ably alumina and a dicationic alkylated polymethylene diamine. The new zeolite is useful in catalytic proces ses, especially xylenes isomerisation.
