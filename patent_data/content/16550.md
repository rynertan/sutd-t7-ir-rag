# Electrical switch with resilient contact arm.

## Abstract
An electrical switch comprises a housing 1 carrying a first, fixed contact 3 and a second, movable contact 6 in the form of a resilient contact arm secured to the housing 1 at one end, and an actuator member 15 mounted on the hous ing 1 and operable to urge the resilient contact arm 6 from a first position out of engagement with the fixed contact 3 into a second position in engagement with the fixed contact 3 . The resilient contact arms comprises a single inner limb 9 and two outer limbs 10, 11 one of which is engaged by the actuator member 15 and the other of which engages the fixed contact 3 on operation of the actuator member, at which, initially the whole resilient contact arm deflects by bending of the single inner limb 9 until the other outer limb 11 engages the fixed contact 3 whereafter the two outer limbs 10, 11 of the resilient contact arm are deflected towards each other thereby to increase the contact force bet ween the other outer limb 11 and the fixed contact 3 . The contact points 4, 25 of the fixed contact 3 and the other outer limb 11 of the resilient contact arm can be embedded in a body 24 of electrically insulating material. The housing 1 can be of one piece construction, the actuator member 15 being retained in the housing 1 by a part of the second contact 6 .
