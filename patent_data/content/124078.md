# Process for the production of dimethyl ether useful as a propellant.

## Abstract
A process for producing dimethyl ether useful as a pro pellant by dehydrating methanol and recovering dimethyl ether from the dehydrated product by distillation, which comprises A a reaction step wherein the dehydration reaction of metha nol is conducted in a vapour phase under pressure of from 2 to 50 kg cm²G in the presence of a solid acid catalyst, B a first distillation step wherein the reaction mixture formed by the above reaction step is cooled and introduced into a pressurized distillation column under pressure of at least 5 kg cm²G refined dimethyl ether is obtained as a side stream substance having a boiling point lower than that of dimethyl ether is distilled from the top and the bottom is withdrawn, and C a second distillation step wherein said bottom is intro duced into a second distillation column under pressure lower than the pressure of the pressurized distillation column un reacted methanol is recovered as a side stream from the sec ond distillation column substance having a boiling point lower than that of methanol is distilled from the top and the bottom is withdrawn, whereby D the unreacted methanol recovered from the second distil lation step is recycled to the reaction step.
