# Catalytic oxidation of solid materials.

## Abstract
One or more monolayers of cerium arrayed on the surface of a niobium metal acts as a catalyst to oxidation of the nio bium at ambient temperature and results in a very thin, very high quality insulating layer which may be configured by pat terning of the catalyst. Significant amounts of Nb₂O₅ are formed at pressures as low as 6.6 10 Other catalytic rare earths usable instead of cerium are terbium and praseodymium other substrate materials usable instead of niobium are aluminium, hafnium, silicon and tanta lum, or oxidizable alloys thereof.
