# Record disc player comprising a braking mechanism for braking a disc.

## Abstract
In a record disc player comprising a disc braking mechanism the turntable 7 is covered by a lid 14 which is pivotally connected to a housing 3 . The lid 14 is latched in a closed position by means of a latching mechanism 30 . A brake lever 21 is pivotally connected to the lid 14 and carries a braking element 23 and a stop element 24 arranged on opposite sides of the pivot. The latching mechan ism 30 can be released by exerting pressure on the lid 14 , the stop element 24 engaging with a stop portion 44 as a result of the pressure exerted on the lid. By the pivotal move ment of the lever 21 relative to the lid 14 a braking torque is exerted on the disc loader 20 by the braking element 23 , so that the disc 13 is stopped.
