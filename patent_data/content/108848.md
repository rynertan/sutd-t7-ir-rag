# Process for preparing alkanols from synthesis gas.

## Abstract
Synthesis gas carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be converted highly selectively into alkanols, especially methanol, by reaction at a temperature of at least 150 C and a pressure of at least 35 bars in the presence of a catalyst comprising a ruthenium compound, a rhenium or man ganese compound, and a quaternary ammonium or phos phonium compound, in the presence of an inert oxygenated solvent ketone, ester, alcohol or preferably ether . Prefer ably a Group VB donor ligand, e.g. triphenyl phosphine, is also present.
