# Preparation of diamino diphenyl ethers.

## Abstract
Diaminodiphenyl ethers DADPE s are prepared by reflux ing sodium or potassium aminophenate with halonitrobenzene in dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is hydrogenated direct ly without isolating the resulting intermediate product, aminophenyl nitrophenyl ether, to form the corresponding DADPE, e.g., oxydianiline ODA . The DADPE is crystallized from the hydrogenated reaction mixture in the presence of an aliphatic alcohol, which may be added to the reaction mixture prior to, during, or after hydrogenation. The resulting crystallized DADPE is typically of high purity and excellent color.
