# Ultrasonic liquid jet probe.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic liquid jet probe for coupling ultrasonic waves with a structure. The probe includes an ultrasonic transducer for emitting or receiving ultrasonic waves, a housing disposed about the transducer and in fluid com munication with a source of liquid under pressure, and a nozzle for shaping the flow of liquid into a round jet column and guiding the ultrasonic waves between the transducer and the liquid jet column. The interior of the housing includes first and second chambers fluidly connected by elongated conduits to impart a substantially laminar flow to the liquid flowing into the nozzle which promotes the stability of the liquid jet column discharged from the nozzle.
