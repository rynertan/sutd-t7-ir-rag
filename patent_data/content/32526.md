# Peroxy dicarbonates, polymerization method and curing process.

## Abstract
Novel peroxydicarbonates are provided in which the alkyl carbonate moiety is 2 alkyl 2 phenyl substituted. The compounds are useful as polymerization initiators of ethy lenically unsaturated monomers, such as vinyl chloride, and as catalysts of unsaturated polyester resins. The sub ject peroxydicarbonates are characterized in that they are solid at room temperature, have ambient temperature stability in spite of a low 10 hour half life temperature, and can normally be transported and stored without refrige ration.
