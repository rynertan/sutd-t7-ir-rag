# An auxiliary mechanical device for magnetic tape registration and or retrieval machines which use high winding speeds.

## Abstract
A mechanical device, comprising a round, low mass, polished, stainless steel tube or rod 1 , which exerts 1 to 15 grams of pressure at, or at about, the point 7 where the tape 5 makes contact with the tape pack onto which it is wound. The pinning down of the tape onto the tape pack prevents air entrapment at this point air on which the tape could float and provides a uniform, even wind. The amount of pressure depends on tape width, tape tension supplied by the machine winding the tape, and tape winding speed. The tube is connected to a tube holder 2 providing means to exert pressure and a mechanism to bring the tube into working position during winding. This mechan ism can be made operational by means of a clutch 10,15 , or an electromagnet 17 coupled to the tape transport command buttons of the machine.

## Claims
Claims 1. A mechanical device, which is auxiliary to machines that use magnetic tape for storage and or retrieval of analog or digital signals, which operate at high winding speeds characterised in that a round, low mass, polished, stainless steel tube, the diameter of which is considerably smaller than the width of the tape, exerts a pressure of 1 to 15 grams in the middle of the tape at, or about at, the point where the tape makes contact with the tape pack onto which it is wound. The tube is connected to a tube holder providing means to exert pressure. 2. A mechanical device as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that a tube is replaced by a low mass polished rod in case the requirement of smallness of a diameter in comparison to the width of the tape would render the application of tube impractical or unfeasible. 3.

## Description
An auxiliary mechanical device for magnetic tape registration and or retrieval machines which use high winding speeds.The invention relates to a mechanical device which is auxiliary to machines that use magnetic tape for storage and or retrieval of analog or digital signals which operate at high winding speeds.The device comprises a low mass polished stainless steel tube the diameter of which is considerably smaller than the width of the tape , which exerts pressure on the tape at, or at about the point where it makes contact with the tape pack onto which it is wound.Machines using magnetic tape for storage and or retrieval of analog or digital signals can be divided into two categories tape recorders and cassette recorders. The difference has to do with the means by which tape guidance is provided either by the apparatus itself or found inside the cassette holding the tape.Tape not housed inside a cassette can either be wound on a hub or on a spool consisting of a hub which has spool flanges on both sides to prevent the tape from jumping off the hub during fast winding.Whatever the variety of electrical, magnetical, and mechanical properties of commercially available tape, all tapes have in common an emulsion carrier and one or more layers of magnetic emulsion, in which information can be stored. Damage to the emulsion causes degradation or loss of information.Whatever the variety of machines using magnetic tape for storage of analog or digital signals, all recorders have in common considerably slower read write speeds than winding speeds.During winding of magnetic tape at high speeds a phenomenon can be observed that is, in a sense, similar to aquaplaning the high speed of winding causes an onrush of air which comes in between the tape and the tape pack onto which it momentarily floats the resulting air entrapment causes an uneven, loose wind with individual turns of tape sticking out of the tape pack and thrown against the spool flanges.The phenomenon can be most clearly observed when a tape machine with one fixed high winding speed as is common today, see Appendix is combined with a tape that is selected for best electrical and magnetical properties. Optimal storage and retrieval results can only be obtained if an intimate tape to read write head contact is maintained. This requires the emulsion carrier to be very flexible, thus degrading its winding properties. Four detrimental effects can be noted which all degrade optimal data storage and or retrieval 1. Shedding of magnetic emulsion particles.2. Deformation of the emulsion carrier.3. Dust adherence on individual turns of tape sticking out of the tape pack which diminishes intimate tape to head contact.4. loose winding, which necessitates the use of spools instead of hubs as is common practice on professional recorders in Europe.The authoritative magazine STUDIO SOUND noted these effects in its annual test reports on magnetic tape for professional and domestic use. see Appendix .Current production recorders rely on tape guides rollers, pins, etc. and tape tension for uniform winding of magnetic tape.However unless air entrapment between individual turns of tape is considerably reduced, no tape machine will be able to wind any magnetic tape really adequately.The invention as claimed solves the problem of damage to magnetic tape caused by uneven and loose winding by remedying its main cause air entrapment. IIt provides the means to exert a little pressure at, or at about the point where the tape contacts the tape pack. Pressure is exerted by a round tube or rod which has a diameter considerably smaller than the width of the tape. The fact that the area of cont aRSt betweenz tube and tape is theoretically infinitely small results in a very firm pinning down of the tape onto the tape pack, thus removing at this point air on which the tape could float.The amount of pressure exerted is 1 to 15 grams, depending on tape width, tape tension supplied by the machine winding the tape, and tape winding speed. The tube being polished precludes damage to the tape through wear.The advantages of the invention are mainly the following 1 Uniform and even winding at high winding speeds of any type of magnetic tape on any kind of hub or spool without damage to the tape used.2. The possibility to wind certain types of magnetic tape, which by virtue of their mechanical properties provide excellent tapeto head contact, on hubs rather than on spools, as is common practice in Europe, a practice which incurs a high risk of tape spillage.3. Pristine condition of magnetic tape after many winds.One way of carrying out the invention is described below in detail, with reference to drawings 1 and .2, which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of a device in accordance with the invention Fig. 2 is a top view of the same device Fig. 3 shows a mechanism to hold or release the tube.All sizes of mechanical parts of this embodiment of the invention stated are optimized for application of the invention on a tape machine using 6.35 mm. wide tape commonly referred to as quarter inch tape .Figures 1, 2 and 3 show a mechanical device which is auxiliary to machines using magnetic tape for storage and or retrieval of analog or digital signals comprising essentially an approximately 200 millimeters long, stainless steel, polished tube 1 with an outside inside diameter or respectively 1.5 1.0 mm.The tube is fastened to tube holder 2 mounted on axle 14 which rotates in bearings 15,11, which allow it limited up and down motion. Spring 12 creates rotary tension between fixed bearing 11 and a clutch consisting of moving part 10 and fixed part 15 connected to axle 14. By depressing 13 tube holder 2 the moving part 10 of the clutch is moved out of space 16 within moving part 10 of the clutch. Rotary spring tension created by spring 12 moves tube 1 from standby position 6 into working position, so that it can exert pressure at point 7, in the middle of magnetic tape 5 wound on a hub with flanges 3 and 9 fixed to it, where tape 5 contacts tape pack 4 during winding. The pressure exerted by tube 1 on tape pack 4 is 4 to 7 grams. Fastened to the end of axle 14, under the face plate 8 of the recorder, is magnetic core 18, which is attracted by electromagnet 17 if an electrical current passes through it, switched by one of the transport command buttons of the recorder.
