## Description
COOLING SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE The present invention relates to cooling systems for internal combustion engines. One known form of air cooler for a marine diesel engine is illustrated in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings and comprises a high temperature air inlet port 01, a low temperature air outlet port 02, a coolant sea water inlet port 03, a coolant sea water outlet port 04, cooling pipes 05, a high temperature section 08, and a low temperature section 09. It has been common practice to cool an air cooler by means of sea water hence, there is a possibility that salt may separate out from the coolant sea water in the high temperature section 08. Because of this the coolant sea water temperature is permitted to rise at most up to about 50 C. In other words, although the quantity of waste heat dissipated in the sea water is relatively large, due to its relatively low temperature, the sea water cannot be utilized as a heat source in a ship, and therefore, it tends to be uselessly thrown away externally of the ship. To meet this disadvantage, it has been proposed to utilize heated coolant as a heat source in a ship in the manner illustrated in Figure 2. Thus, as shown, the air cooler is divided into two, high temperature and low temperature sections 08 and 09 respectively, of which the low temperature section is for sea water cooling as described above, whilst the high temperature section 08, having inlet and outlet ports 06 and 07 respectively, is designed for fresh water cooling. Thereby, the temperature on the side of the coolant fresh water outlet port 07 can be relatively high and therefore used for heat utilization. However, this prior art system has the disadvantage that it is made somewhat complex due to the need to install standby lines for use upon stoppage of the marine engine, or interruption of waste heat utilization, or other causes. On the other hand, recently there has been an increasing demand for saving energy on board ship and in addition to the waste heat from exhaust gas which has been collected and utilized heretofore, there is also a need to collect and utilize the waste heats of exhaust air and jacket coolant water. However, since the temperature of these waste heats is low, although the quantity of the waste heat s is relatively large, it is hard to collect and utilize, and in the case of employing a cooling system for a diesel engine as discussed above, particularly with reference to Figure 2, the system can be complex, and so a sufficient effect cannot be expected. In view of the aforementioned disadvantages in the prior art, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide a novel cooling system for an internal combustion engine, in which the waste heats of exhaust air and jacket cooling water can be effectively collected and utilized. According to the present invention, a cooling system incorporating an air cooler for an internal combustion engine, the air cooler being divided into a high temperature section and a low temperature section along the direction of flow of a fluid to be cooled, each section having a coolant water inlet and outlet port is characterised in that both sections of the air cooler are designed for fresh water cooling, the coolant water outlet port of said low temperature section of the air cooler is connected to a coolant water inlet port of a water jacket of the engine, and in that the coolant water inlet port of said high temperature section of said air cooler is connected to a coolant water outlet port of said water jacket, the connections being such that, in use, said low temperature section, said water jacket and said high temperature section in that order, are cooled in series by fresh coolant water. Thus, in accordance with the invention, the component parts of the cooling system are connected in the order of an outlet temperature with the lowest one placed first as illustrated in the following EMI3.1 tb coolant SEP Fresh SEP Water SEP t SEP Air SEP Cooler SEP Low SEP b SEP ater SEP Water tb SEP Temperature SEP Sectian SEP jacket tb SEP Waste SEP Heat SEP SEP Air SEP Cooler SEP High SEP jacket tb SEP Utilizaticn SEP Air SEP Cooler SEP High tb SEP Teeeerature SEP Section tb The cooling system of the invention enables the following advantages to be obtained 1. fresh water is raised in temperature to be utilized as a coolant and a heat source e.g. for a ship thereby the steam generated by an exhaust gas economizer can be saved, and electric power generated by a turbine generator can be increased by the correspond ing amount 2. a quantity of the coolant fresh water is reduced in temperature, and thereby the electric power required for a coolant water pump can be decreased and 3. by carrying out high temperature jacket cooling, exhaust gas temperature can be raised, and so, electric power generated by a turbine generator can be increased. An additional feature of the system resides in that a by pass of coolant fresh water is provided for shortcircuiting the air cooler low temperature section, and a control valve is provided in the by pass for controlling the temperature of the coolant fresh water at the outlet port of the water jacket constant. The present invention can be applied widely to recovery of waste heat of an internal combustion engine for marine use as well as for land use. The above mentioned, and other features and objects of the present invention will become more apparent by reference to the following description of one preferred embodiment of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2, respectively, are schematic views showing structures of known air coolers in the prior art, and Figure 3 is a schematic system diagram of a cooling system for an internal combustion engine according to said preferred embodiment of the present invention. Referring now to Figure 3, the preferred cooling system comprises an air cooler 30 having an inlet port 1 for high temperature air, an outlet port 2 for low temperature air, a high temperature coolant section 3, and a low temperature coolant section 4. The system also includes a water jacket 5 of the engine, a tank 6 for coolant fresh water, a pump 7 for the coolant fresh water, and a fresh water cooler 8, provided between a delivery port of the pump 7 and an inlet port of the low temperature section 4 of the air cooler 30, for cooling the coolant fresh water by means of sea water fed through path 11. The system further includes a circulation pump 9 for circulating heated water from the tank 6 for utilization of waste heat , to a group of heater equipments 10, and return to the tank.A control valve 12 for coolant fresh water temperature, is provided at the confluence of a fresh water path 15 on the inlet side of the low temperature section 4 of the air cooler 30, and a by pass 16 connecting a fresh water path 18 on the delivery, siae of the water pump 7 to said fresh water path 15 on the inlet side of the low temperature section 4 of the air cooler 30, which by pass shortcircuits the water cooler 8, said control valve serving to regulate the temperature of the fresh water on the inlet side of the low temperature section 4. In addition, a control valve 13 is provided for setting the temperature of the coolant fresh water, which valve is located in a by pass 17, which connects the fresh water path 18 on the delivery side of the water pump 7 to the fresh water path on the inlet side of the water jacket 5 so as to shortcircuit both the water cooler 8 and the low temperature section 4 of the air cooler 30, the control valve 13 serving to regulate the temperature of the fresh water on the outlet side of the jacket 5. It is to be noted that in Figure 3 reference numeral 14 designates a standby heater of steam type . In use the cooling system described above with reference to Figure 3 operates as follows Coolant fresh water is delivered from the water tank 6 with the aid of the water pump 7, and, after it has beer regulated to an appropriate temperature by means of the control valve 12, it first cools the lower temperature section 4 of the air cooler 30,then cools the water jacket 5 of the engine, and subsequently cools the high temperature section 3 of the air cooler 30, as indicated by arrows. By employing the above described arrangement, waste heat from the scavenged gas passing through the air cooler 30 and from the water jacket is jointly collected by the coolant fresh water, and thus the final temperature of the coolant fresh water can be raised up to a sufficiently high temperature although the temperature is equal to or lower than the air temperature at the high temperature air inlet port 1 . This hot water is led to the coolant fresh water tank 6, from which it is circulated via the pump 9 to the various heater equipments 10, and the like in the ship as a heat source. The circulating water is subjected to heat exchange, and is thus lowered in temperature again, and is returned to the water tank 6 to be mixed with incoming high temperature coolant water, after which it is fed via the water pump to the fresh water cooler 8. In the case of the above described cooling system, the following advantages can be obtained 1. By utilizing the heat of the coolant fresh water for various heating purposes in a ship, steam generated by an exhaust gas economizer can be saved by a corresponding amount, and can be fred to a turbine generator. Thereby electric power generated by the turbine generator can be increased by 10 158 2. Since the final temperature of coolant fresh water can be high, the amount of the coolant fresh water can be reduced, and hence the capacity of a coolant fresh water pump and electric power necessitated therefor can be decreased.3. By carrying out water jacket cooling with fresh water at a high temperature, the temp erature of the exhaust gas is raised, and in this aspect also, electric power generated by a turbine generator can be increased by 15 20 .4. As the connecting line between the air cooler and water jacket can be realized by pipework within the engine, its installation in a ship can be simplified. 5. Installation in the case of a scoop cooling system, or a concentrated fresh water cooling system can be achieved advantageously and easily.6. A standby line normally required when the main engine is stopped,or when waste heat utiliza tion is interrupted, can be realised in a very simple manner. 7. Since a scavenged gas temperature can be maintained relatively constant, the system provides measures against poor quality fuel used under light load conditions and measures against exhaust gas temperature rise in winter. 8. A salt separation phenomenom in the air cooler is eliminated. Whilst one embodiment of the present invention has been described above, as a matter of course it is intended that all matter contained in the above description, or shown inFigure 3 of the accompanying drawings, shall be interpreted as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense.
