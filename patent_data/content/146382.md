# Torque sensor of noncontact type.

## Abstract
In a torque sensor of a noncontact type for sensing a torque applied to a shaft 2 , a magnetic ribbon 4 is bonded to a circumferential portion of the peripheral surface of the shaft 2 , and a core member made 6 of a magnetic material is arranged above the shaft surface so that its end faces are faced to the magnetic ribbon 4 . An exciting coil 8 and a detecting coil 10 are wound around the core 6 so that a magnetic flux produced by the exciting coil 8 and delivered to the detecting coil 10 is detected by the detecting coil 10 . The magnetic ribbon 4 has a length LO equal to or smaller than one half of the circumferential length Ls of the shaft 4 and satisfying an inequality given by L1 LO 2L1 where L1 is the center to center distance between the dn faces of the core 6 .
