# Controlling light beam spectrum.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling the spectral com ponents of a light beam are described. The apparatus com prises means 3 7 for generating a collimated light beam means 9 for dispersing the collimated beam a mask 1 in cluding an aperture 2 the size of which is such that a portion of the dispersed beam passes through the aperture in use and movement means not shown for causing relative trans verse movement between the light beam and the aperture. A memory not shown is provided for storing in use a profile of the relative transverse movement between the light beam and the aperture 2 required to obtain a desired spectral response in the transmitted light beam, the movement means being re sponsive to the stored profile to cause relative transverse movement in accordance with the predetermined profile.
