# PROCESS FOR PREPARING ACRYLIC POLYMERS USING A DUAL PEROXIDE INITIATOR SYSTEM

## Abstract
A process for producing acrylic polymers which have high thermal stability, are free of defects and have a low level of unreacted monomer. The process includes the polymer ization at a high production rate of a methyl methacrylate syrup in the presence of a mixture of two peroxide initiators. The first initiator has a 5 minute half life at temperatures between about 75 C to 100 C and emits a maximum of 1 mole of carbon dioxide per 2 moles of free radicals. The second initiator has a one minutes half life at temperature of between about 105 C to about 125 C and emits a maximum of 1 mole of carbon dioxide per 1 mole of free radicals.
