# High temperature well packer.

## Abstract
A well packer 20 for use in geothermal wells or steam injection wells. The packer 20 can be anchored to the inner wall of a casing string 25 to resist differential pressure in either direction. The anchoring means includes a single set of slip elements 50 which are hyrdaulically or mechanically set. The packer 20 includes a sealing unit 30 with packing elements 36 and 37 especially adapted for high temperature wells. The packer 20 can be simply released from the casing by upward tension on the tubing 21 .
