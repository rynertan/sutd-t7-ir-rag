## Description
INTEGRAL OPTICAL DEVICE AND METHOD The invention relates to a new article of manufacture embodying a glass surface having a raised optical pattern, especially an array of spherical microlenses, integral therewith, and to a method of creating such array on a photonucleable, opacifiable glass surface. By properly proportioning the optics of the array, a 1 1 erect conjugate image may be produced, thereby making the device particularly applicable to compact photocopiers. Lenticular elements have been molded on both glass and plastic surfaces for various purposes. Thus, such elements perform a light focusing or controlling function in the panels or faces of light integrators and light refractors. They may also function primarily to scatter ambient light, as in projection screens and in cathode ray tubes. Optic devices, such as just described, tend to exert a single optic effect, e.g., refracting or bending light rays which strike the element. The devices embody no imaging capability or concept. In general, the molded elements are rather large.Further, they do not normally require critical attention to precise accuracy such as required for image transmission in a photocopier for example. Recently, it has been proposed to produce a strip lens array by molding a plurality of tiny microlenses on a plastic surface. The microlenses would be molded in rows and columns on two parallel plastic lens plates. With proper attention to spacing, lens size and other factors, a very compact and efficient imaging device could be produced. As used herein, the term array refers to arrangements of lenses in a pattern regardless of the number of rows and or columns involved. A single row may be referred to as either a linear array or a strip lens 1. If lens arrays are to be used for imaging purposes, it becomes necessary to isolate light channels between opposed lenses and thereby eliminate crosstalk . This poses a serious problem in an integrally molded device The possibility of creating a strip lens by grinding and polishing individual glass or plastic rods has been recognized. The individual cylinders would then be arranged in a pattern and bonded in a fixed relation. However, the extreme problems of production and alignment have also been recognized. Accordingly, a currently commercial imaging device relies on optical effects generated by an array of minute surfaces, each having a defined gradient refractive index distribution. The array is produced by bundling a configuration of optical fibers wherein each fiber has a defined gradient index distribution imparted thereto as by ion exchange or material impregnation. United States Patent No. 4,168,900 Adachi describes an erect optical imaging system for copying apparatus comprising a first pair of array sets of object lenses and a second pair of array sets of relay lenses spaced from and aligned with the first pair, the first pair producing a real image and the second set producing an erect image. In each pair, one array is offset relative to the other. The lenses are square bars of glass or plastic that are 2 mm on a side. United States Patent No. 3,605,593, reissued asNo. 28,162 Anderson , discloses an optical imaging apparatus embodying a pair of mosaics haing lens arrays which image small portions of an object into a larger composite image. Such an apparatus is further discussed by Anderson in an article entitled, 1,Close Up Imaging of Documents and Displays with Lens Arrays , in the 15 February 1979 issue of Applied Optics, Vol. 18, No. 4. United States Patent No. 3,544,190 5.oorhusen also discloses an apparatus for forming a continuous image from an object at 1 1 magnification.

United States Patent No. 3,931,438 Beall et al. discloses a laminated article formed with one lamina being a surface layer and the other an interior core.The two laminae are similar chemically and close in coefficient of thermal expansion, but densify to different degrees on cooling, thereby setting up compressive stresses. United States Patent No. 3,719,462 Andreatch, Jr. et al. discloses a means of producing light guide paths in glass by mechanically stressing or densifying the desired path. One purpose is to provide an optical device embodying a raised optical pattern on its surface. Another purpose is to provide such a device in which the pattern is formed integral with a glass surface and forms a smooth, unbroken, curved surface therewith. A further purpose is to provide such a device in which the pattern is an array of raised elements. Another purpose is to provide an array of microlenses integral with a glass surface. A further purpose is to provide such an array of microlenses that is not restricted te one or two linear arrays. Another purpose is to provide in one integral glass body opposed arrays of microlenses in registry and having cylindrical light paths therebetween. A further purpose is to provide such an integral lens array embodying means for optically isolating each lens system and preventing cross talkt . Another purpose is to provide a method whereby said optical isolating means is developed coincident with the lens development. A particular purpose is to provide an optical imaging device that is small, compact and simple to produce. Another purpose is to provide an optic imaging device that employs less glass bulk, and hence enables more compact copiers and similar imaging devices. A further purpose is to approxImate more ciosely uniformity of illumination in a lens array imaging device. It is a specific purpose to provide an optic imaging device capable of forming a 1 1 erect conjugate image. A further purpose is to provide a simple method of producing such optical patterns and imaging devices with photonucleable opacifiable glasses. Other purposes and benefits will become apparent as the invention is hereafter described and defined. In its broadest aspect, the invention is a body of photonucleable, opacifiable glass having opposed surfaces, at least one of which bears integral therewith a raised optical pattern. In a particularly useful form, the pattern is an array of microlenses. The invention further provides, as a new article of manufacture, an optic imaging device wherein two arrays of microlenses are formed, one on each opposed surface of a photonucleable glass body, the arrays being in registry whereby each microlens on one surface pairs with a corresponding microlens on the opposite surface, and with an intervening, clear, light transmitting cylinder, to form a system for imaging purposes. In this imaging device, each array of spherical microlenses rises above, and is integral with, a glass surface, each microlens in an array is closely and uniformly spaced from adjacent microlenses and the intermediate matrix glass is substantially opaque. In preferred embodiments, the microlenses have a diameter of at least 100 microns, preferably 300 microns, and the lens thickness T is so related to the lens radius of curvature R and image object working distance X by the first order approximation formula EMI6.1 that a 1 1 erect conjugate image is formed. The lenses on the first surface forms a demagnified relay image inside the clear area, which in effect becomes an object for the second surface lens. The invention further provides a method of creating such article which comprises the steps of exposing a surface of a photonucleable, opacifiable glass body to a source of short wavelength radiation, the exposure being through a mask composed of material which transmits the radiation, except for closelyspaced, opaque dots of uniform size arranged in an array corresponding to the desired lens array, heat treating the selectively exposed glass to develop opacifying crystallites in the exposed areas and to cause densification of said crystallie containing network, whereby the array of unexposed areas 5 drawn into an array of spherical lenses. In the accompanying drawings, FIGURE 1 schematically illustrates a lens system formed in glass by selective densiflcation in accordance with the invention, FIGURE 2 is a magnified surface profile trace c a typical microlens in accordance with the invention, FIGURE 3 is an enlarged view in crss section illustrating selected light paths in an imaging device having equal power surfaces and transitting a 1 1 conjugate image, FIGURE 4 is similar to FIGURE 3, except that the device has unequal power surfaces. FIGURE 5 is similar to FIGURES 3 ana 4, but illustrates two devices in tandem with interior field lenses, and FIGURE 6 is a magnified top view of a mask having a negative dot pattern. The present invention is based on observations regarding behavior of a photonucleable, opacifiable glass as such glass is opacified. It has been observed that the glass undergoes densification during thermal opacification. More importantly, it has been observed that, when such a glass body is selectively exposed to activating, short wavelength radiation, the exposed portions tend to densify while the unexposed portions do not. Hence, the exposed regions undergo shrinkage.This exerts a radial compressive force on the unexposed regions of soft glass thereby drawing them into a raised pattern with smooth curved surface. The raised pattern will assume a condition of minimum energy whereby, for example, a circular unexposed region will be drawn into a spherical shape due to surface tension. These observations led to the perception that a raised optical pattern could be formed in a glass surface by controlled, selective exposure of an opacifiable glass. The pattern may take any desired geometrical form, but is described in terms of microlens arrays because of commercial interest therein.The lenses that may be formed are extremely small in size. For example, in a typical array, where each lens has a 200 micron diameter and adjacent lenses are on 300 micron centers or axes, a two 2 inch square glass surface may have 28,900 microlenses formed thereon. Such pattern development is schematically illustrated in FIGURE 1 which shows a single lens system 12 formed in a flat strip 10 of photonucleable, opacifiable glass. Lens system 12 embodies spherical microlenses 14 and 16 which form as raised optical elements on opposite surfaces of glass body 10. The microlens pattern forms as zone 18 of the glass contracts due to differential densification between the opacified zone 18 and the clear zone constituting lens system 12. Lens system 12 consists of a clear, light transmitting, cylindrical zone 20 and microlenses 14 and 16 on the respective surfaces 22 and 24 of the glass body. Zone 20 is surrounded by, and optically insulated by, continuous matrix 18 which is opacified.Thus, matrix 18 has been exposed to radiation which nucleated the glass and permitted crystal growth on heat treatment. Coincident with the crystal growth, the glass became denser and shrunk below the level of the unexposed, and hence unopacified, cylindrical zone 20. In FIGURE 1, solid lines 26 indicate original glass boundaries, whereas dotted lines 28 indicate the corresponding boundaries after densification. In dimensional markings, S is the lens height, that is the extent to which the lens extends above matrix 18 2L is the glass thickness or length. of cylincrical zone 2 between microlenses 14 and 16 D is the lens diameter.These values are related in this manner EMI9.1 where g is original glass density and a5 s is the final or opacified glass density. The radius of curvature of a lens is given by R D2 85 The arrangement illustrated in FIGURE 1 is particularly beneficial where the optical pattern forms an array of lens systems. Then, the opacification of zone 18 not only causes formation of the lenses 14 and 16 it also provides the opaque separators or barriers vital to preventing cross talk between lens systems in an array. As noted earlier, a particular utility for lens arrays is in an optical imaging device such as used in photocopiers. A lens array in accordance with the present invention provides several important advantages for this purpose. One such advantage is that the number of lenses that can be produced in one simple operation is practically limitless. Further, the lenses can be made very small, while still retaining a high degree of uniformity. The importance of minimizing lens size may be seen from the fact that the power of the lens is given by the expression R n l where R is the radius of curvature of the lens. This is directly related to the square of the lens diameter by the expression Dê no 1 R where D is the lens diameter and the expression is a constant. Therefore, it is frequently desirable to minimize the lens diameter. Such reduction is important in economically reducing the size of imaging devices and apparatus such as photocopiers. Currently, mirror systems are frequently used to accommodate long light paths in small space. These add to both the complexity and the cost of the apparatus. Another factor of considerable concern is uniformity of illumination. This is another area where the flexibility in the rows and columns of an array can provide superior results to a device limited to one or two linear arrays. Lens height is dependent on degree cf exposure of the glass to short wavelength radiation and to subsequent thermal treatment. Where the glass is exposed on one surface only, the lens height on the opposite unexposed surface may be essentially the same as that on the exposed surface in a thin glass sample. As thickness increases above about two rm a differential tends to occur and to become greater with thickness.In any event, the lens height does not usually exceed about 20 microns, much less than the lens diameter. It is possible to maintain essentially equal lens height in glass of greater thickness if one exposes the glass sample from both faces. The respective masks and equipment must be arranged in very close registry.Then each side is given an equal degree of exposure.While this procedure has been successfully employed, it is very difficult and time consumina to carry out. As indicated, it is usually desirable to maIntain as small a lens diameter as possible, consistent With other requirements. However, accuracy and uniformity of both lens curvature and lens size become increasingly difficult to maintain as size is decreased. Hence, a diameter of about 100 microns is a practical minimum and a diameter of about 300 microns is preferred. The upper limit on size is governed primarily by the optics requirements in any given situation. Normally, about 500 microns is a practical upper limit, although larder lenses can readily be produced. FIGURE 2 of the drawing shows a magnified surface profile trace of a single microlens in a lens array.In addition to overall magnification, the height and breadth are exaggerated relative to each other for illustration purposes. Thus, in the graphical illustration, units along the horizontal axis equal 30 microns, whereas units along the vertical axis are in microns. Thus, the lens may be considered as greatly condensed laterally, or greatly expanded vertically, to show the shape and spacing. Thus far, the imaging device has been considered only in terms of a single pattern or array of spheres formed on and integral with a glass surface. For image transmitting purposes, however, the device may be considered as an array of lens systems constituted by elongated cylinders extending through a glass body between microlenses on opposite surfaces. As mentioned earlier, a particular application utilizes the fact that a 1 1 erect conjugate image can be transmitted by controlling the optic characteristics of the device. This is illustrated schematically inFIGURES 3, 4 and 5. As illustrated in FIGURE 1, lenses 14 and 16 are formed on the front and back surfaces, respectively, of glass plate 10. The two surfaces may exhibit equal power lenses, but will usually differ, especially if initial exposure is directed to one side of glass plate 10. The possibility of having one to one erect imaging depends on the radius of curvature of the front and back lenses, and on the separation between the lens arrays. In a single piece device having equal power surfaces, such as schematically shown in FIGURE 3, one may formulate an approximate relationship for conjugate imaging as,EMI13.1 where R radius of curvature of the lens n glass index of refraction 0 T thickness of the imaging device x image distance Similar relationship may be developed for te situation where a single piece device has different power surfaces. This situation is illustrated inFIGURE 4. The corresponding forl for conjugate imaging here is,EMI13.2 A single piece imaging device, such as illustrate in FIGURES 3 and 4 is a preferred form because or simplicity of production. However, sunless one employs a dual exposure system as noted earlier, this requires exposure through the body by the activating radiation. In turn, that tends to limit the thickness of the glass body employed. This situation can be resolved by forming individual devices and then stacking these to achieve the desired device thickness. Such an arrangement of two devices is schematically illustrated in IGURE 5 wherein designations of dimensions correspond toFIGURES 3 and 4. In preparing such a composite device, the individual bodies are first developed as single piece devices. That is to say the glass bodies are selectively exposed through a multi aperture mask and heat treated to differentially densify the body and develop the ricrolens pattern. The single piece bodies are then placed in registry and corresponding lens systems accurately aligned as by maximum light intensity eQuipment. It is recognized tha a preferred condition is to have lens of ecual power on both the entrance and exit side of a s tEXesm. It is also customary to expose a glass body fror. one surface only, this being known as the front surface . In a dual stack then, for example, we arrange the bodies so that both outward facing, or exposed, surfaces are front surfaces . It will be appreciated that the microlenses on the outside surfaes are the only ones that are directly involved in raging. The inside, or facing, lenses serve no direct function and could be removed if desired. T.e ras, however, serve indirect purposes, and we prefer to leave then on the devices. One very signIficant function served by the inside lenses is that of a field lens. Light rays, which are at such an angle as to otherwise be lost, may be bent back by these interior lenses as illustrated in FIGURE 5. Thus, the lowest, or outside ray in each group of traces might be lost, except for the indicated field effect. This provides improved brightness. It is of course necessary to align the two or more devices. However, light ream equipment is available which adjusts such devices to a maxir,um transmission value and then locks them in position for sealing or other unification procedure. Accuracy of spacing and centering the microlenses in an array, as well as in maintaining their spherical surface, is extremely important in order to obtain a clear, undistorted image. The literature has noted the great skill and long and troublesome labor required to obtain microlenses by grinding and polishing, as well as subsequent alignment. The present invention provides a simple, inexpensive procedure for producing the desired integral lens array. Basically, the inventive method utilizes a physical phenomenon observed to occur when a photosensitively opacifiable glass is selectively pacified. Stookey observed, and his U.S. Patent No.2,628,160 was based on such G serv tion, that the opacified and clear areas in a selectively opacified photosensitive glass are rendered differentialiv etchable, whereby filicrees and other etched patterns are produced. It has now been observed that differential densification of the glass occurs during the photosensitizing and crystal orrina process.Thus, the crystal containing areas tend to contract ana become denser. The crystal free areas do not undergo change, and hence do not contract. The result is a potential for producing an optical pattern in a glass surface by controlled formation of a physically raised pattern having an unbroken surface. We have now found that the nature of this relIef image may be controlled by contro linµ the initial radiation exposure of the glass. oiore specIfically, we employ an otherwise transparent mask having a pattern of opaque dots corresponding to a desired lens array.Thus, the mask is transparent to the activating actinic radiation, except for the pattern of opaque dots. When the glass is exposed through such mask, the exposed zones become nucleated. Meanwhile, the cylindrical zones under the opaque dots remain unexposed, and hence unnucleated. The glass is then heat treated in the usual manner to cause crystal growth in the exposed areas. This causes the exposed glass to contract and draw away from the uncrystallized cylindrical zones. Surface tension causes the transparent protrusions to assume spherical shapes and to appear as raised spherical surfaces with interstitial valleys. Any photosensitively opacifiable glass may be employed. Included are the several glass composition families discussed in the Stookey patent, and that patent is incorporated herein for its teaching. The crystal phases are lithium disilicate and metasilicate, barium disilicate and alkali metal fluoride. The lithium silicate glasses are comumercially available and provide a substantial crystal formation. Hence, they have been primarily used in the studies hereafter reported. A photosensitively opacifiable glass, available from Corning Glass Works under Code No. 8603, was employed in the studies described below. This glass has the following composition as calculated in parts by weight on an oxide basis SiO2 79.1 Li2O 9.4 Na2O 1.6 K 20 4.2 Al 203 4.2 Zn0 1.0 Sub203 0.4 Au 0.0012 Ag 0.115 CeO2 0.015 SnO 0.003Three 3 2 x6 strips of this glass were cut from a rolled sheet 1.5 mm in thickness. Additional strips of varying thickness were cut ro other rolled sheets. One face of each strip was covered with a mask having a negative dot pattern as shown in exaggerated dimensions in FIGURE 6. Having reference to FIGURE 6, mask 30 has an array of dots 32 that are uniform in size and in spacing. These dots are opaque to actinic radiation such as emitted b a mercury arc lamp. Portions 34 of mask 30, intermediate dots 32, are essentially transparent to the radiation. Three masks were provided, each with opaque dots differing in size from the others. Thus, the diameters of dots 32 were, respectively, 150, 200 and 300 microns. Each masked glass sample was exposed through its mask to radiation from a Hanovia 435 watt mercury arc lamp positioned about 15 inches from the masked glass. Exposure time was 100 seconds. Subsequent to exposure, the samples were heat treated between the annealing and softening temperatures of the glass in accordance with standard photosensitive glass processing practice. Thus the samples were heated to 5400C, held to permit nucleation, then heated to 5800C, and held to permit crystal growth. Each of the samples was observed to have a series of spherical bumps or protrusions at both the exposed surface and the opposite surface. A surface profile trace, such as shown in FIGURE 2, was made on each sample to demonstrate sphericity of the lens developed, as well as permit determination of dimensions. Optical studies showed the capability of the spherical bumps to act as microlenses, the quality depending on the spherical quality of the lens surface. Measurements showed the lens height, resulting from the 100 second exposure, to be 8.6 microns. This value was obtained with each of the mask dot sizes. A further set of samples was given identical treatment, except for a 75 second exposure. In this case, lens height was found to be 6.8 microns. Density measurements show that the microlenses were formed at a density ratio of about 1.01. Thus, the clear, uncrystallized glass, as originally melted and as found in the image transmitting, cylindrical channels, had a density of 2.36. After exposure and heat treatment, the crystallized glass had a density of 2.38. It has been previously stated that lens power, as measured by the lens radius of curvature, depends on lens diameter and on glass thickness. The heat treatment employed for crystallization may also influence the value. To illustrate various influences on this value, variations were made in heat treatment following exposure, in glass an hence lens system thickness, and in lens diameter as determined by dot size in the masks employed. The data for these determinations are shown in the TABLE below. Throughout the TABLE, the radius of curvature R in each case is given in mm for both the front and back surface lens elements. Exposure was from the front surface, and was held constant. Heat treatment is shown in degrees C minutes hold. Sample thickness is in mm and lens diameter in microns. In the heat treatment set of samples, lens diameter, as determined by mask dot size, was 300 mIcrons in the thickness variations, a 200 micron diameter dot size was employed in each case. In the heat treatment set of samples, glass thickness was 2 rm, while 3 rrjr thick glass was used in the samples where lens diameter was varied.

The effect is schematically illustrated in FIGURES 3, 4 and 5. The relationship between the lens array thickness, the radius of curvature of the lenses and the image to object distance has been found to be expressed by the formulae earlier set forth relative to FIGURES 3, 4 and 5 where x is the object distance, R is the radius of curvature and n is the refractive index of o the clear glass. One can then design any desired conjugate distance by suitably choosing the radius of curvature for the lens and the lens thickness. Radius of curvature is a function of and controlled by parameters as outlined above.
