# Optically active derivatives of mercaptoisobutyric acid and a process for preparing them.

## Abstract
Optically active compounds of formula R S CH₂ CH CH₃ COOH in which R is either a H₃C CH₃ ₃C , CH₃ ₃CO , C₆H₅CH₂O , C₆H₅ , o NO₂C₆H₄ , p NO₂C₆H₄ or a p CH₃C₆H₄ group, or salts or esters thereof. The compounds are prepared by the following sequence of reaction steps a there is started from a racemic mixture of a compound according to said formula in which R a C₆H₅ group, b cinchonidine, D 2 aminobutanol 1 or a derivative thereof is added to this compound as resolving agent, c the D salt of the resolving agent formed is crystal lized out and isolated, d if necessary, this salt is further purified from the L isomer by recrystallization, e the pure D salt is hydrolysed in order to remove the resolving agent, f the D S benzoyl β mercaptoisobutyric acid thus lib erated is won and, if necessary, purified, and g if desired, the C₆H₅ group is replaced, in a way known per se, by one of the other possible groups indicated above for R.
