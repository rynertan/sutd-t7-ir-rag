# Dimeric oligopeptides as haptenic epitopic sites for hepatitis.

## Abstract
Methods and compositions concerned with the a deter minant of hepatitis B antigen, providing immunogens and antibodies. The immunogens can serve as vaccines. They include a dimeric oligopeptide having not more than 15 amino acids in each leg mimicking the amino acids 139 147 of hepatitis 15 antigen, which is conjugated to an immunogen such as a tetanus or diphtheria toxoid.
