# Coupler for telephone cords.

## Abstract
A coupler 30 for electrically connecting ends of tele phone cords which have been terminated with modular plugs 24 24 includes a first portion 31 made of a dielec tric material and having a plurality of compartments 45 45 which extend from end to end and which are formed be tween partitions 41 41 , each of which has a centrally disposed bifurcated stem 46 . A contact element 42 in the form of a wire having a linear portion 51 and two retro flexed end portions 52 52 is mounted in each compart ment with each retroflexed end portion extending between adjacent furcations of the stems. A second portion 32 made of a dielectric material is joined to the first portion and includes an abutment 71 which extends between the fur cations 47 47 of the first portion to stabilize the partitions. The second portion cooperates with the first portion to form a pair of back to back externally communicating cavities 60 60 . Each cavity is adapted to receive a modular plug such that terminals 54 54 of the plug whch is inserted into one of the cavities electrically engage associated retro flexed end portions of aligned contact elements between the partitions.
