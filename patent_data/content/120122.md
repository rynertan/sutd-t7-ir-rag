# Hydrogenation of long chain olefinic oils with Raney catalyst.

## Abstract
An improved monolithic hydrogenation catalyst and pro cesses for using same to hydrogenate animal and vegetable oils, said catalyst being comprised of a Raney metal alloy surface layer integral with and derived from a selected nickel alloy monolithic substrate mesh structure wherein said sur face layer is predominantly derived from an adherent Beta structured crystalline precursor outer portion thereon. The catalyst is adaptable to both continuous and batch hydrogen ation and shows enhanced activity, improved triene to diene selectivity and a low isomerization index. Hydrogenated oils show lower linolenic and stearic contents, lower trans isomer percentages and lower melting points as compared to com mercial products of equivalent iodine number.
