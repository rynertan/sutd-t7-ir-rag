# Ammonia synthesis.

## Abstract
In an ammonia synthesis process a nitrogen hydrogen synthesis gas is reacted partially over a catalyst at a pressure in the range 30 120 C, ammonia is separated as liquid after cooling the reacted synthesis gas and unreacted synthesis gas is recycled. The liquid ammonia is evaporated in heat exchange with reacted synthesis gas to provide the required cooling effect. Such heat exchange is effected using a heat exchange surface as in a plate fin heat exchanger of at least 1.5 mÂ² per kg mol per hour of ammonia to be condensed, with cold end temperature approach of less than 8 C and a hot end temperature approach of less than 5 C whereby exploit the heat effect of, inter alia, the non ideality of ammonia and to provide product gaseous ammonia at a convenient pressure with minimal mechanical refrigeration.
