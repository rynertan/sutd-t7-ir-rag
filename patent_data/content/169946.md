# A process for preparing liquid or shock absorbing material starting from waste sludge from the paper or board industry.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a liquid or shock absorbing material, comprising the step of dewatering the waste water from a process in which fibres consisting completely or mainly of cellulose are wet processed, to obtain a semi dry mass, which mass is then reduced, after which the resulting material is subjected to a drying process, said waste water, based on dry matter, containing 20 50 by weight of fibres and 80 50 by weight of an inorganic pigment and being mixed with a surfactant, the reduction being carried out by conveying the semi dry mass having a water content within the range of from 40 to 70 by weight by means of a screw, thus granulating the material.
