# Digitally controlled machine.

## Abstract
An electrically powered machine 12 is coupled to a power source 11 via a safety relay 101 . The machine includes a motor 14 energised through a switch 15 and coupled to an emitter device 16, 17 which generates pulses upon rotation of the motor. A control system 10, 102, 103 controls operation of the switches and is responsive to pulses from the emitter device. To test whether the relay and switch are actually under control of the control system, the output register thereof registers, in the appropriate bit positions M and R bits to open the relay and switch in sequence. If emitter pulses are received when either of the relay or switch should be open, then an inhibit signal inhibits operation of the machine.
