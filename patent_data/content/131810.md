# Process for recovering cesium from pollucite.

## Abstract
Cesium is recovered from a cesium bearing mineral such as pollucite by extraction with hydrochloric acid to obtain an extract of cesium chloride and other alkali metal and polyval ent metal chlorides. The iron and aluminum chlorides can be precipitated as the hydroxides and separated from the solu tion of the alkali metal chlorides to which is added potassium permanganate or other water soluble permanganate to selec tively precipitate cesium permanganate. The cesium precipi tate is then separated from the residual solution containing the metal chlorides. The cesium permanganate, which is in a very pure form, can be converted to other cesium compounds by reaction with a reducing agent to obtain cesium carbonate and cesium delta manganese dioxide.
