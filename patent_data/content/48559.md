# PILE STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
Pile structure for use in batteries, particularly seawater batteries. The pile structure comprises one or more plates 2 which are separated by separator plugs 3 which extend via through holes 5 from surface to surface of each plate. The separator plugs 3 are formed to integral spacer heads 33 beyond one surface of each plate. A continuous or intermit tent band 30 is formed around the edge of each plate, and is provided with projections 36 which extend beyond that one surface of each plate, coextensively with the spacer heads. The separator plugs 33 and bands 30 may be formed by injection moulding process. The openings between the projections 36 permit passage of seawater. Another application for the pile structure is as a heat exchanger.
