## Description
SPECIFICATION TITLE OF THE INVENTION Mattress Having a Corrugated Plate BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a mattress which provides a sound sleep to a sleeper. Conventionally, it has been believed that bedding or mattress having a soft feeling assures a sound sleep.Furthermore with the advent of foam rubber and spring mattresses, the type of bedding used today feels much softer. However, these types, in general, are so soft that the spinal cord of a sleeper tends to bend downwardly during sleep. Therefore the weight of the sleeper cannot be uniformly supported by the bedding. Due to the above manner of sleeping, a person often feels pain in his shoulder, waist or spinal cord. To be more specific, since conventional bedding is made of extremely soft material, such as urethane foam rubber, the central portion e.g. shoulder, waist or hip of the sleeper s body sinks into the bedding. Therefore, sufficient respiration to impart a sound sleep cannot be obtained while the blood is congested and the body temperature is high in those areas which come into direct contact with the mattress. Both of these prevent the sound sleep which also occurs on the part of the body e.g. shoulder, hip or waist that sinks into the bedding. On the other hand, some people belive that a bedding made of hard material assures a sound sleep. However, in practice, this type of bedding is not suitable for any person except youngsters, since it causes the upward curving of the spine and the stretching of muscles. Therefore, it is of vital importance that the ideal condition of a mattress be such that it is soft to the touch yet firm enough to uniformly distribute the sleeper s weight. It is an object of the present invention to provide a mattress which can resolve the afore mentioned defects of conventional beddings, including the spring mattresses. It is another object of the present invention to provide a mattress which can enhance the circulation of the blood within the body as well as set sleeper free from pains that occur in the shoulders or areas which come in direct contact with the upper surface of the bleeding. It is still another obJect of the present invention to provide a mattress which is further equipped with a desired number of magnets which can effectively cure the deficiency syndrome of magnetic fields, such as the imbalance of autonomic nerve or the stiffness in the shoulders. BRIEF DESCRTIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a plan view of the mattress of this invention. FIG. 2 is a cross sectional side view of the above mattress taken along the line I I of FIG. 1. FIG 3 is a cross sectional view of the above mattress taken along the line II II of FIG. 1. FIG. 4 is a perspective view with a part broken away of the above mattress. FIG. 5 is the chart showing the differences in body pressure distribution between the conventional mattress and the mattress of this invention. FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B are illustrative views showing the weight distribution of a sleeper who lies o the conventional mattress and the mattress of this invention respectively. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE The mattress of this invention is hereinafter disclosed in conJunction with attached drawings, FIG. 1 through FIG.4 In the drawings,numeral I indicates a mattress of rectangular shape e.g. 1900mm X 1300mm X 40mm which is made of semi hard urethance foam rubber such as RubbetanP or Rubbetan H both are trademarks produced by Toyo RubberIndustry Co., Ltd of Japan . This mattress is provided with a number of round protrusions 2 on both upper and lower surfaces thereof and these protrusions 2 form a regular pattern. Referring to the configuration of each protrusion 2, it is preferable that the pitch between the protrusions 2 is about 27 to 35 mm 1.06 to 1.38 while the height of the protrusion 2 is about 10 mm 0.39 . The mattress of this invention is substantially featured by the provision of a corrugated board of hard material, such as plastic, which is sandwiched between the upper layer and the lower layer of the mattress 1. Due to the above employment of the corrugated board, when a sleeper lies on the mattress, no specific portion of his body e.g. hip or waist sinks deep into the mattressNamely, the weight of his body is uniformly distributed over the mattress so that he can have a sound sleep. Furthermore, the corrugated board of this invention can consist of large and small portions which terminate at the area of the mattress where the sleeper s knee bends so that the mattress can be easily folded and transferred to a desired storing place such as a closet. In general, it has been believed that the magnetic force is good for recovering from fatigue or for adjusting the functions of human organs. Especially, the magnetic force is said to be effective for the deficiency syndrome of magnets tic fields such as stiffness in the shoulders, pain in the spinal cord, waist pain, prostration, the habitual habitual headache or the imbalance of the autonomic nerve. For providing the above magnetic force, which has a favorable medical effect on those conditions, the mattress of this invention is further provided with a desired number of magnets. As shown in the drawing in the valleys, formed between and among protrusions 2, a desired number of magnets 3 are disposed, They are substantially distributed at the portions of the mattress which come into direct contact with the sleeper e.g. shoulder, spinal cord, waist or hip . The magnets having the following particulars have shown a favorable effect. thickness about 3mm 0.12 diameter about 11.5mm 0.45 magnetic flux density 500 600 gauss It is also preferable that the magnets 4 are mounted in such a way that a slight gap remains between the sleeper s body and the magnets when the sleeper lies on the mattress of this invention. Referring to other parts of the mattress of this invention, a cloth which can favorably disperse aweat or the like encloses the mattress 1 for. providing the softer feeling to the mattress 1. THE EXPERIMENT RELATED TO THE DISIRIBUTION OF THE SLEEPER S WEIGHT In illustrating the performance of the mattress of this invention with respect to the distribution of the sleeper s weight, the following conditions were decided and set up before conducting the experiment. Two beddings were prepared. One consisted of a conventional mattress of 100 mm 3.93 with the cotton filled thin bedding Japanese futon disposed over the mattress.The other consisted of the mattress of this invention and the straw made bed Japanese tatami mat . Four subjects slept on the above two bedding respectively. FIG.5 shows the mean body pressure change chart obtained by the Manschette method, wherein the weight of the respective portions of the subject is converted into the Manschette s inner pressure, which can be measured as body pressure. In the chart, the mean weight of the subjects who slept on the conventional mattress is described by a solid line, while the mean weight of the subjects who slept on the mattress of this invention is described by a dotted line. As can be observed from the chart, the conventional mattress shows high body pressure of about 20 to 25 kg 44.15 to 55.19 Ib at the waist or the hip. This implies that the above portions of the body considerably sink into the mattress. Whereas, the mattress of this invention shows a body pressure of about 5 to 10kg 11.04 to 22.08 1b at the head and legs and almost uniform body pressure of about 15kg 33.11 Ib at the shoulder, the spinal cord and the waist. This implies that no specific parts of the body sink into the mattress as compared to the conventional type and substantially uniform weight distribution can be obtained. FIG. 6A and FIG. 63 provide other charts showing the length and width distribution of the body pressure measured by Manschtte method wherein FIG. 6A relates to pressure distribution of the mattress of this invention while FIG. 6B relates to the pressure distribution of the conventional mattress. As can be observed from the above charts, the conventional mattress shows that the body pressure substantially concentrates on the area ranging from the waist to the hip, and this area extends in both right and left directions from the spinal cord. The mattress of this invention shows that the body pressure is uniformly distributed over the shoulder, the spinal cord,the waist and the leg portions and no portion of the body is subject to the concentration of body pressure. These days, the number of people who suffer from waist pain are increasing. It is noted that the main cause of waist pain is the weakening of a muscle or tendon. In the above situation, it is not preferable that the body pressure concentrates on the hip or waist. Furthermore, the wide contact area, which can be observed when the subject lies on the conventional mattress, also provides a shallow sleep since the humidity or temperature of the contact area rises. According to the mattress of this invention, since it provides a uniform distribution of weight, the user can have a deep and sound sleep.
