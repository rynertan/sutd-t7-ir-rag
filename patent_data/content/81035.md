## Abstract
Apparatus for stacking a web of continuous prefolded paper forms 10 includes a compacting mechanism 50,80 having a plurality of elongate rigid compacting finger elements 70, 84 vertically suspended in pairs and freely pivotable from a horizontal rotating crankshaft 51, 81 located above and along one side of a paper stack 21 . The finger elements 70, 84 which have a roughened active surface 76, 95 are vertically reciprocated by the crankshaft 51, 81 so that their active surface 76, 95 slidingly engages the topmost fold or edge 46, 47 of the stack 21 during downward movement but disengages the stack 21 during upward movement.
