# Improvements in bushes.

## Abstract
A bush has a rigid tubular inner sleeve 11 , a tubular body of resilient elastomeric material 13 extending around and secured to the inner sleeve and an outer shell 14 secured to the outside of the body of elastomeric material. The bush fits into a housing 17 in such a way that the body of elastomeric material is compressed, and hence, stress relieved. The bush is located axially in position in the housing by means of a circumferential rib 16 which engages a slot.
