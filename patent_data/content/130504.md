## Description
MINIMIZING VOLTAGE DELAY BY HIGH SURFACE AREA LI ANODES The present invention is directed to lithium thionyl chloride cells, and more particularly to provision of means for reducing the voltage delay problem therein. The lithium thionyl chloride system is considered to be one of great promise, particularly in view of the high energy density which characterizes the system. The system, and analogous systems are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,926,669, U.K.Specification No. 1,409,307 and elsewhere in the art. As is frequently the case in relation to technical developments of great promise, difficulties have been found in relation to the system which, if solved, would enhance the commercial future of the system. One such difficulty in relation to the lithiumthionyl chloride system is that of voltage delay , whereby the cell potential falls upon application of load and then rises slowly before reaching its operational value. The problem is accentuated upon a storage of a completed cell, particularly upon storage at an elevated temperature, and has been attributed to passivation of the anode. Solutions to the problem have been suggested. Thus, in U.S. Patent No. 3,933,501, use of a thin, vinyl polymer coating on the anode is suggested to prevent passivation and reduce voltage delay. Again in U.S. Patent No.4,228,229 modification of the cathode electrolyte is suggested i.e., the patent suggests replacement of LiAlC14 as electrolyte dissolved in thionyl chloride with the reaction product of AlCl3 with either Li2S or Li2O. Even more effective solutions are still desired. Voltage delay in a lithium thionyl chloride cell is reduced by employing in said cell a lithium anode having an extended surface. The extended surface on the lithium anode which is the special feature of the invention may be created by any means which will indent the lithium surface. Thus, embossing with a patterned roll is effective. Scratching or indenting the surface is also operative. Porous powder metallurgy structures having an extended surface are also useful. The invention is effective with various electrolyte salts dissolved in the thionyl chloride cathode. Examples will now be given Example 1 Three electrode flooded cell tests using lithium strip as test, counter and reference electrodes and a thionyl chloride solution of LiAlC14 at 1.6M concentration as electrolyte were performed. In testing, current was applied to the test electrode and its polarization response was measured against the reference electrode. Smooth and embossed lithium test electrodes were employed, with embossing being accomplished by pressing a fine nickel screen into the lithium foil strip on both sides and then removing it. Test electrodes were coated with ethyl 5 cyanoacrylate CA by dipping electrodes into a 1 3 by volume solution of CA in dry ethyl acetate twice for 15 seconds with a 60 second rest between applications.Final CA coating thickness 25,4 m was about 0.001 inch Results of the maximum anode polarization for both coated and uncoated test electrodes are given in TableI, for 6 mA cm2 applied current, 24 hours of anode storage in electrolyte at 200C. The data represent the average of 2 to 4 tests. TABLE I Uncoated CA coated Smooth 2.537V 0.859V Embossed 1.768V 0.608V The value for the applied current is based on the geometric surface area. Maximum Anode Polarization x is the maximum excursion of the lithium test anode from its rest voltage in response to an applied current and is directly related to voltage delay. EXAMPLE 2 Further comparisons between smooth anodes and embossed anodes embossed to increase the surface area by approximately a factor ofEMI4.1 were conducted in a thionyl chloride solution into which had been dissolved about a one molar concentration ofNbC15 Li2S with the additions being about equimolar. For this testing the test electrodes were storedEMI4.2 days in electrolyte at room temperature. Applied current was againEMI4.3 based upon geometric area. Average maximum anode polarization volts is given in Table II as x , o is standard and n is number of tests.

The cells had a rating of about 1.5EMI5.1 thionyl chloride electrolyte containing LiAlC14 1.6M , a porous carbon current collector and a cyanoacrylate coating on the anodes.The cells were stored for 6 weeks at 450C. When tested at an anode current density of 6EMI5.2 the cells having smooth anodes required 16.05 seconds to reach 2.7 volts average of 4 cells whereas the cells having embossed anodes required only 6.24 second to reach 2.7 volts average of 6 cells . While the invention has been described herein in conjunction with batteries having thionyl chloride as the liquid cathode or liquid inorganic cathode depolarizer , it is to be appreciated that the art has recognized that other oxyhalide compounds are the equivalent of thionyl chloride. It is to be understood that the invention is applicable to such equivalent systems. Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as those skilled in the art will readily understand. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and appended claims.
