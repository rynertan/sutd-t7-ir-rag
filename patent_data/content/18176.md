# Process for producing flame retardant flexible polyurethane foams with blends of dibromoneopentyl glycol and flame retardant plasticizer and the foams obtained by this process.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for producing flame retardant flexible polyurethane foams having a poro sity in the range between 0.5 and 10 cubic feet per minute. A polyol having an average molecular weight between about 250 and about 6,500 is reacted with toluene diiso cyanate which comprises a mixture of the isomers of 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate. The concentration of 2,4 toluene diisocyanate isomer is not critical. The formulation of the present invention includes a flame retardant mixture of a plasticizer and dibromoneopentyl glycol. The plastici er is either a halogenated phosphonate or halogenated phosphate ester. Chlorine is the preferred halogen atom. The weight ratio of those ingredients is between about 50 50 and about 90 10 with the ratio 85 15 preferred. The concentration of that mixture is from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight of the polyol. Other ingredients that can be included in this formulation are water, a silicone surfac tant, a tertiary amine catalyst, a tertiary amine co catalyst, an auxiliary blowing agent and a tin catalyst. This process results in foam products that are flame retardant and suit able for automotive and furniture applications.
