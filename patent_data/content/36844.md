# Method of manufacturing plastic containers by blow molding without any waste and machine for carrying out said method.

## Abstract
A container of thermoplastic material is obtained starting from a parison 23 coming down vertically from an extruder 9 and squeezed in a transverse direction at a suitable position thereof, once it has reached the re quired length, by jaws 10 , so that its side walls weld to each other along a line, thus providing beneath the jaws 10 a workpiece generally in the form of a hollow cylinder having the upper end closed. At this time a blade 11 severs the workpiece so obtained from the parison 23 above the jaws 10 , which open and drop the workpiece on a support 6 in the form of a mushroom arranged co axially to the parison and forming a part of a blowing nozzle. The purpose of the mushroom support 6 is to support the workpiece from inside at its closed end and to transfer it, by a translation of the nozzle assembly 1 , between two half molds 12 which are subsequently clos ed. At this time the axial stretching of the workpiece takes place due to the lifting of the mushroom member 6 , and the blowing is then carried out thus providing the mole cular double orientation of the thermoplastic material un til the workpiece takes the shape of the mold 12 . After a suitable cooling the mold 12 is open and the container is stripped therefrom, which need not be further finished because no waste of any kind is involved in the method.

## Description
Method of manufacturing mastic containers by blow molding withoat any waste and machine for carrying out said methodThe present invention relates to a method of manufacturing hollow plastic containers or bodies by blow molding and to a machine for carrying out said method.Machines producing plastic containers by extrusion and blow molding are known.This method has the disadvantage that the containers undergo both in the neck and bottom portion of the container a waste which weights up to 30 upon the weight of the raw material used. For some types of materials recovery of said waste is not allowed. In any case the waste weights, even if it is recovered, sensibly upon the cost of the finished product.These machines imply, in addition, a shifting of the heavy and cumbersome molds between the manufacturing steps.Machines producing plastic containers by injection and blow molding are also known. These machines, while producing plastic containers without waste, are however uneconomical because of the intrinsic slowness of the manuracturing process and as a result the output is poor. In addition, these machines involve a high cost for the molds inasmuch as tvwo different molds are required for each working cycle the one for obtaining, by injection, the preform and the other for the final forming, by blow molding, of the containers.It is the obJect of the present invention to obviate the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art machines for manufacturing containers and thus to obtain containers which, besides not involving waste, are manufactured with a high output, More particularly the method of manufacturing plastic containers according to the invention is characterized in that it comprise3 the itepsog obtaining a preform from a plastic parison coming out vertically from an extruder, introducing the preform when it is still hot in a mold and blowing air inside the preform to cause it to expand to the mold con figuration. This method has the advantage, with respect to the prior art extrusion and blow molding method, that it effects the severance of the extruded preform to be blown from the remaining parison coming out from the extruder, outside the mold, this avoiding the formation of deadheads which are uxiavoidably formed when the mold acts simultaneously as ase w Sng DolSor the preform to be blown from the remaining extruded parison.The method according to the invention has in addition the advantage that it does not require the shifting of heavy and cumbersome molds, since the mold is stationary and it is the preform to be blown which is brought from the extruder to the mold.With respect to the injection and blow molding method, the method according to the invention has the advantage that it does not require an injection molding machine with the attendant mold, which adds to the blowing mold, since the preform is obtained from a conventional extruded parison.The machine for carrying out the method according to the invention comprises a support movable in an axial and transverse direction which is driven by a piston, said support having at its top a surface adapted to support the preform and being movable in a transverse direction between a position coaxial to the extruder and a position coaxial to a stationary blowing mold, and a welding and cutting device arranged beneath the extruder and adapted to squeeze and cut the extruded parison so as to form the pre form.The invention will be better understood from the following detailed description, given merely by way of example and therefore in no limiting sense, of an embodiment thereof, referring to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a vertical cross sectional view of the machine taken along a plane including the axis of the extruder and the axis of the mold Fig. 2 is a horizontal cross sectional top view of the machine of Pig. 1 Fig. 3 is a fragmentary vertical cross sectional view of the machine taken along the axis of the extruder, in an operation step of the machine Fig. 4 is a cross Eectional view similar to that of Fig.3 in a second operation step of the machine Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view similar to that of Fig.3 in a third operation step of the machine Fig. 6 is a fragmentary vertical cross sectional view taken along the axis of the mold, in a fourth operation step of the machine Fig. 7 is a crpss sectional view similar to that of Fig. 6, in a fifth operation step of the machine Pig. 8 is a cross sectional view similar to that of Fig. 6, in a sixth operation step of the machine Fig. 9 is a vertical cross sectional view of the container after the opening of the mold andFig. 10 is a cross sectional view similar to that of Pig.9 in a further operation step of the machine.Referring to Pigs. 1 and 2, it is shown that the machine consists of an assembly 1 comprising a first cylinder 2 and a second cylinder 3 integral therewith. The first cylinder has inside a piston 4 integral with a rod 5 which is hollow axially and coaxial to the cylinder 2, which rod bears on its top end a mushroom head 6 provided with orifices 7 communicating with the axial bore of the rod.The second cylinder has inside a piston 8 integral with a hollow rod 29 receiving internally the rod 5. The latter can move vertically both with respect to the piston 8 and the cylinders 2 and 3. An extruder 9 is arranged coaxially to the rod 5 above it. Provided beneath the extruder areJaws 10 movable horizontally in either direction, on whose upper face is arranged in contact therewith a blade 11 slidable horizontally thereon. The machine comprises also a mold 12 consisting of two half molds 13 see Fig. 2 which can close and open in the direction of the axis Y Y, each of which is integral with a piston 14 contained in a cylinder 15 secured to the housing 16 of the machine. A piston 17 of a cylinder 18 secured to the housing 16 of of the machine is integral with a rod 19 in turn integral with the assembly 1.A ring nut 20 arranged on the rod 5 and adjustable thereon is adapted to control in its movement in the direction of the axis Z Z two microewitches 21 and 22.There will be described now, with reference to the accompanying drawings, the operation of this machine during a whole cycle. From the head of the extruder 9 comes down vertically a plastic parison 23 see Figs. 1 and 3 which, when the required length is reached, intercepts a light beam emitted by a source 24 see Fig. 3 which, since in that position of the extruded parison is no longer wicked up by the photocell 25, causes the two Jaws 10 to close. The Jaws squeeze the extruded parison in a direction transverse to its axis at a suitable section of the parison, so that its opposite walls weld together see Fig. 4 providing beneath the Jaws a workpiece generally in the form of a hollow cylinder having the upper end closed, which will be referred to as preform and indicated with the reference numeral 26. Immediately after the closure of the Jaws the blade 11 severs the preform 26 from the upper portion of the parison, as is seen in Fig. 4.Simultaneously the piston 4 is actuated which rested until that time on the bottom of the cylinder 2 Fig. 1 causing the rod 5 to lift, whose mushroom upper end 6 stops, inside the preform 26, close to its upper closed surface Fig. 4 due to the micro switch 21 actuated by the ring nut 20 carried by the rod 5. At this step the preform 26 is still re tained at its appendix 27 resulting from the squeeze and cut of the parison by the Jaws 10 in a closed position although it has been already severed from the parison above the Jaws. Thereafter tha Jaws 10 open and return together with the blade 11, in their starting position, causing the preform 26 to fall on the mushroom head 6 which bears it from inside at its closed end, as is seen in Fig.5, in which is seen that also the lower end 27 of the preform rests on an abutment 28 on a rod 29 of the piston 8.At this time the piston 17 in the cylinder 18 is actuated which moves from the right end of the cylinder 18 to the left end of the same cylinder causing to move in the direction of the axis I also the assembly 1 connected to the piston by means of the rod 19. This operation permits it to bring the preform 26 from a position at the axisZ Z of the extruder see Fig. 1 to a position coaxial to the axis Z Z of the mold.Upon translation of the assembly 1 the pistons 14 of the cylinder 15, which wero up to this time in a position such as to keep the mold open, are actuated so as to bring the half molds 13 closer to each other and cause the mold which contains now the preform to close see Fig. 6 . The actuation of the piston 8 which was resting up to this time on the bottom of the cylinder 3, causes the rod 29 to lift which rod stops in a position corresponding to the maximum stroke of the piston 8. This operation permits it to form the neck of the container in cooperation with a contoured seat 32 suitably provided in the mold. Simultaneously the piston 4 of the cylinder 2, which was in the position corresponding to the actuation of the microswitch 21, is again actuated so as to cause the mushroom head 6 to rise further until the ring nut 20 causes the microswitch to trip which causes the mushroom head 6 to stop in such a position that the upper end or the preform 26 skims the top of the mold 12. In this step, therefore, the axial stretching of the preform is effected as can be seen in Fig. 7.The next step consists of blowing in air from inside the preform which is cloyed now also at the lower end, Air is blown in through the axial hole in the rod 5 which communicates with the openings 7 on the mushroom head 6 causing the preform 26 to expand until it take s the configuration of the mold 12 as can be seen in Fig. Q, After a suitable cooling of the mold so as to cause the container 30 so obtained to harden, as is well known to those skilled in the art, the mold is open by actuating the pistons 14 which return in their starting position causing the half molds 13 to move apart from each other and thus to release the container 30 which, however, is still supported by the neck portion of the rod 29 by means of the abutment 28 and, at its bottom, by the mushroom head 6 as is seen in Fig. 9.A suitable device, such as a sucker 31, removes now the container so obtained from the rod 29 and deposits it in a suitable place, whereas the actuation of the piston 4 of the cylinder 2 causes the mushroom head to lower which returns in its starting position corresponding to the lowermost position of the piston 4 in the cylinder 2. Simultaneously, the piston 8 of the cylinder 3 returns also in its starting position and as a result causes also the rod 29 to lower.The actuation of the piston 17 of the cylinder 18 permits it finally to bring back the assembly 1 in its starting position coaxial to the extruder 9 , thus completing the cycle. From the foregoing detailed description it is seen that the machine illustrated has a number of substantial advan tages with respect to the prior art machines. Its method of operation is in fact intermediate between that of the extrusion and blow molding machine and that of the insection and blow molding machine, thus Bumming the advantages of and eliminating in addition the known above mentioned disadvantages of these two types of machines.The higher output and the better quality obtainable on the final product, which in addition undergoes no waste of any type, is due to the fact that, unlike what occurs in the prior art machines, the moving mass is minimum and the preform 26, retained simultaneously at the top and the bottom during its translation, cannot rock inside the mold but is positively positioned on the axis of the mold. In addition, the axial stretching of the preform 26 further improves the homogeneity and uniformity of the circumferential thickness in addition to giving the container a better mechanical strength permitting it to obtain, in association to the subsequent radial expansion of the preform 26,by means of blowing, the bi axial orientation of the material of the container.It should be noted, in addition, that by using the machine of the present invention, the rib 27 formed outside the closed end of the preform 26 during the welding of the side walls of the parison 23, has an orientation at an angle in the present case 900 to the plane in which the mold 12 closes. This avoids that lines of lower mechanical strength be formed at the bottom of the container, what would instead occur in the case the plane in which the mold closes were parallel to the direction of the rib 27. It should be also noted, that in the method illustrated it is no longer the mold which has to be moved, as opposed to what occurs in the extrusion and blow molding machines of the prior art, and the short distance between the extruder 9 and the mold 12 avoids an excessive cooling of the preform 26.As a result of the above stated it is possible to provide a machine which is lighter and therefore more economical also from the standpoint of the power consumption.While but one embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, it is obvious that a number of changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.
