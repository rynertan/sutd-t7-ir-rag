It is the main object of this invention to provide and secure a retentive and supporting capacity for the said restoration of ti tie in a harmless,cosmetic,hygienic,formstable,fracture resistant I pecise, permanent retentive and adjustable manner.An other object of the present invention is the provision of a self cleaning protection by means oj a medical graded protective silicon oilfilm daily applied by a dispenser on the outersuriace of denture and a silicon oil liniment applied in the innersurfa cf dcntu e Iatent applied Australia No 1943,5 10 77 thereby enhancing the resistance to foodimpact and plaque aswell the re sistance to discolouring agents on the whole restoration teeth included caused by foodatains,nicotine,bartrestone,curry etc.., aswell the resistance to the bacterien and acidformation on the enamel of living teeth. An other object of the present invention is the provision of a ntralnfree bitefunction articulation in the regitoration of title free from vertical and horizontal levereffects according the last modern articulation theories based on a horizontal rotational gli ding or based on a non interferring gliding of the existing natu ral abraded unobtrusive tooth pattern.Said restoration is surveyed and processed heatcuring in fracture resistant resin according a proper direct tecnic on te mastersto nemodel without the duplicating procedure.According the present invention of the title there is provided a special tissue born base provided with rest onlays or palatinal baseotop instead of metal reets made of fracture resistant resin said base is combined with anterior or posterior saddles carrying the detlture teeth,eaid reutorntion Of title may be in form of n single saddle with 2 or 3 or 4 denture teeth,said blue and sad dies are deigned to achieve A harmless supporting restoration in respect with the remaining living and abutmentteeth,1ngiva margin and parodontium.Conveniently in one form of the invention,single saddle or various saddles united in a base between the remaining living teeth,in or der to retain and stabilise the said restoration of title without drift,drop,rock or tilt securely and strainfree between the retai nerteeth in an inconspicuous and harmless manner,I devise there fore a precise retention and rest system comprising different elements as our harmless cosmetic rests in form of onlays and in design to resist the compressive load without pulling force on the supporting living teeth are used on healthy living abut mentteeth and processed in each saddle of the various forms of restoration according title,said rest onlays made of fracture resistant aswell wear resistant resin clear ,gum or tooth to ned are devised cosmetic in arrowform on the buccal side to cheek and lingual side to tongue toothsurface of the abutmentteeth. An alternative for the said rest onlay in form of a base stop designed in the.denturebase is devised only in up per partial restorations in case the living abutmentteeth are too weak for support said basestop is processed in resin to the inside of the baseplate in the form of a half parabole including the postdamming rear border of denturebase with a depth of a O.5mm tmm and 3 mm width. The specified supporting system of above ie further combined with a precise surveyed,resiliently strain free retention systen made of high tensile,indestructible preformed wrought chrome nickel wire 0.65 mm for weak teeth 0.5 mm ,said retention system is devised with 2 minute resilient preformed anchors which are fastened into the path of insertion of each saddle to fit and grasp not pin pointing lwithout pressure and pull1 the spheric bell of the side surface in dental term approximal toothsurface left or right of the abutmenttooth by means of a selective and analytical surveying method and plan in order to realise the re tentive capacity in a hidden aesthetical and comfortable mode without foodtrap.Said anchor is preformed in a standard form and aid size adaptable in all cases of restorations.According this manner of above,the saddle.base of the new form of restoration of title is suspended ina atressless contact be tween 2 or more natural retainer teeth and follows stressless the motion of the semi rigid livingteeth by means of the flexi bility of the anchors,said anchors are shielded against food impact and covered with a silicon thick graded viscuous li liniment of medical grade oil to protect the enamel. Alternatively,I provide in an other form of the invention accor ding title a lower or upper partial related to the bilateral free end type case where all the posterior teeth are missing . Same elements are used as above and an extra labial bar desig ned for stability and support in the frontpart of the jaw is joi ned to the posterior saddles. The said forms of restoration of invention according title may be provided with a chrome nickel base instead of resin t ase in a case of combined saddles Instead of the duplicating pro cedure the withdrawn tecnic by means of a resin texturised wax pattern may be applied for economy of worktime.Said anchor may Pe combined with semi precision attachments as the mortice rest and crowns in bilateral free end construotion .

Fig.11 Illustrates a proper designed and constructed mounting instrument used to set up the restoration of title according a proper non interferring articulation Referring to the drawings,and more particularly to the figs. 3 and 2 there is shown the form and structure of the restoration according title varying according the case of missing teeth said restoration is processed in fracture resistant resin in form of one single saddle.with denture teeth broadly designated by the lx ig.8 or in form of various saddles with denture teeth combi ned in a special tissue born resin or chrome base broadly de designated by Fig.3 which is designed and constructed with the following elements it will be appreciated that any one or more saddles may consti tute the embodiment of this invention illustrated in Eigs.l ll. Thus,the restoration of title designated in Figs. l front view and 3 top view shown on the masterstonemodel 1 , a replica of patient s upper jawconsists of a supporting denture base 2 ,Fig.3 made of fracture resistant resin1 .mm thicktor chrome alloy 0.45mm tissue born in the palate of the mouth said base functions to unite and bear various saddles 3 in proper way of an even and to lerable distribution of the masticatory and occlusal pressure.The basestop 4 in form of a parabolic rim including the postdam ming rear border of denture base 48 is processed in resin or chro me as a half parabolic rim of O.5mm imm depth and 3rnm width Si tuated in the innersurface of the resin or chrome denture base, it functions as a substitute for the harmfull metslrests used in the conventional chrome or plastic partial restoration,said base stop is only devised in the upper partial restorations combined with onlay rests or without in case of weak abutrnentteeth rule . Said base stop 4 functions particularly to hold the total partial structure and its function in place eliminating the drift of the proper denture seat and articulation functional bite contact and eliminating the strain on the living abutmentteeth 7 or 7 X . The various saddles,one anterior 3X and two posteriors 3 united in the supporting base 2 are removably bridging the interocclu sal space of missing teeth in the arch of the dentition to resto re a harmless contact with the remaining teeth and to restore the proper bitefunction and aesthetic eliminating the drift arld eruption of the healthy living teeth.The articulation of the restoration in title is established on sound principles of a non interferring function between the teeth upper and lower by means of a determined horizontal rotational sliding with flat abraded denture teeth in harmony with a horizon tal even equilibrated bite pattern according the horizontal theo rie or by means of a free rotational sliding in harmony with the existing natural abraded pattern properly sliding without o struction in order to eliminate eruption of the teeth caused by vertical and horizontal lever effects. As an alternative for the basestop used as a harmless rest element, a complete onlay structure illustrated in Fig.2 a 5 6 composed of a buccal onlRy 5 in form of an arrow and a lingual onlay 6 in a more extended form of an arrow is devised as a harmless support on the buccal and lingual toothsurface of strong selected living a butmentteeth 7 Fig.2b. As the natural tooth structure tolerates a compressive loadforce to the extend of its natural limitborder but as a natural tooth is not made for pulling load proof in the application of cera mic jacketcrown restoration, said restoration will rather break by a lateral force than by a compressive vertical load ba6ed on this fact the onlay structure of the invention is designed to trans fer vertically the compressive load without any pulling what is not the case with the conventional clasp structure combined with restEach saddle 3 has in most cases 2 complete onlay structures to be located on two living abutmentteeth 7 729 strong teeth selected and surveyed to locate the said onlays .Said type of onlay rest 5 6 is applied particularly in a single sad dle Fig.8 3 illustrated on the mastermodel 1 as a replica of patient s lower jaw. The said onlay rests 5 6 are waxadin shape of an arrow on the sur veyed abutmentteeth of model and processed in a rigid,clear or gum or tooth toned fracture and wear resistant resin into the den ture tooth 19 Fig 2 a of the saddle base.The length of the onlay is 5 mm.,its joint 5by by rootform into the denture tooth 19 is 3rnm. and the point 5 is 1 mm. To qualify the jracture res.i6tAnt resin used for the structure of the onlays and the whole restorationdenture teeth includedtin the guality to resist wear,foodplaque,bacterien,acidormation causing toothdecay aswell the discolouring agents as foodstains,nicotine, tartrestone etc.... a thick viscuous 12.000 30.000 centistokes medical grade silicon oil is applied in the inner surface of onlays and restoration by means of practical designed dispenser said den ture treatement is valuable for 24 hours and is daily to be re newed by rinsing under hot tapwater and drying with a tissue in order to deodorise and to keep the total restoration in a per manent new look and perfect hygiene a thin film of medical gra de silicon oil is applied with a dispenser on the outersurfa ce of the restoration said treatment is valuable on used and new dentures,old dentures have to be cleaned first by a special la boratory polishing procedure patent applied in Australia No 1943 5 10 1977. The.design and form of said onlay structure is located in the rest zone 8 illustrated in Figs. 8 or 9 of the abutmenttooth 7 or 7X marked by the circumference lin ddividing the whole toothform in a restzone and retentionzone 24 .The surveying procedure of the onlay structure is detailed in the complete construction plan of restoration according title.The function of said onlay rest is to resist the side pressure and sinking motion of the saddle restoration caused by lateral and occlusal force.The specified harmless supporting system of above devised by means of the design of denture basei2 or 27Jor 2k or 23 ort3W provided with rest onlays or basestop is further combined with a precise surveyed, resiliently,stresstroken retentionsystern composed of 2 minute retention anchors 10 and 10 illustrated in Fig.3,said an chors are processed in the proper surveyed path of invention of each saddle full descries on is detailed in the complete construc tion plan of restoration according title. The design and structure of the minute retention anchors 10 ort1otJ 3 mm height is illustrated according an increased scale separate ly at the side of Pig.3 in the design 10X for anterior living abutmentteeth and 10 for posterior living abutmentteeth.Its structure is preformed in one standardform and size 10 to be modified in iO ,its use is universal in any restoration of title in order to be adapted on any toothsize of the selected living abutmentteeth 7 r and 7 which are surveyed illustrated in Figs. 3 and 9 and 10,full description is detailed in the complete construc tionslan to follow.The anchor 10 is composed with a anchor head 10V ,Fig.1O,a flexible stem 11 1a resilient arm 12 and a anchor tail 13 completely illustrated in Fig. 10. The standardform 10 fig. 3 designed for use on the side surface of the posterior teeth 7 is reformed in a proper form 10XJFig.3 for use on anterior teeth 7k properly surveyed see construction plan to follow . The structure of the said anchor 10 is indestructable,formstable, and anatomical preformed to grasp the bell of the tooth,spring tension can be adjusted and is adaptable to any toothform and size,posterior or anterior it is made of high tensile chrome nickel wrought wire fracture resistant in 0.45 mm for weak teeth and 0.65 mm for strong teeth.In Fig. 3 a partial upper restoration according title is illustra ted in place on the masterstonemodel of the patient s upper jaw. The construction of said restoration as above is composed with 3 saddles one anterior 3X with four dentureteeth 19X and two posteriors 3 with 6 denture teeth 19 ,the two posterior saddles 5 are fitted with two minute harmless anchors 10 in the proper path of insertion 14 14 ,Fig.9 of each saddle. The proper contact and location of said anchors 10 and path of in insertion 14 14 are realised by a time saving surveying nrocedure for direct processing of the restoration on the masterstonemodelt1 outlined in the complete constructionplan to follow. Said retention anchors have a flexibility of 0.5mm 1mm to sus pend the saddle restoration in a strainfree contact between the natural retainer teeth 7X 7 7X 7 in Fig.3.Said anchors of above cooperate in harmony with the natural flexibility of the living teeth and rootstructure without to harm the enamel of the tooth structure by use of the silicon oil thick grade as mentioned neutralising any dammage of the metal contact,acid formation, bacterien causing decay.In case of decay during normal circum stances of the further life cycle a gold inlay or composite in lay is used as restoration and the anchor is refitted in the new situation a metal inlay chrome bridgealloy would be most desirable In Fig.7 a partial lower restoration based on the principles of title and composed of three saddles with 8 denture teeth one an terior 2 teeth 3 4 and two posteriors 6 teeth saddles 3 W 3 said restoration is illustrated in place on the masterstonemo del 1V being a replica of the patient 8 lower jaw. Ttie two posterior saddles 3tV are devised with two minute harm less retention anchors 10 in the proper surveyed path of inser tion 14 14X Fig. 9 of each saddle the method of devising said insertion and fitting of preformed anchors lO are detailed later in the description of the complete construction plan of the res toration in title said anchors 10 and 10 have a.proper contact and location as said for the upper partial restoration in Fig.3.The anchors 1O nd 1ON have the same design and structure as the one s used in the above said restoration of Fig.3. To support said lower restoration Fig.7 the same design of the complete onlay structure 5 6 ig.2 a is used as for the upper res toration in Fig.3 said onlay rests 5 6 are applied on the abut ments 7 . In case of weak abutmentteeth 7 the retromolar pads 15 are used as substitute for the onlay rests their function is the like as a shock absorber ,in case of weak abutmentteeth 7X the onlay rests are devised on the other living teeth 16 . The base 2V is made of fracture resistant resin or chrome alloy designed as broadly and thinly,1 mm thick ,the loweredge 2 is 2 mm with teardropform,said supporting base 2 is without contact on the remaining living teeth. Alternatively I provide an other form of the invention according title specified as a bilateral upper or lower free end restora tion illustrated in Fig.5 and 6 a and b.Said form of structure is designated where all natural posterior teeth upper or lower are missing with the anteriorteeth 17 only remaining. In reference with above Fig.5 illustrates a bilateral upper par tial free end restoration according title in place on the master stonemodel lY as a replica of patient e upper jaw.The said re storation Fig.5 is composed of a complete tissue born base 2X de signed with a parabolic basestop 4X in form of a rim including the postdamming 4 rim in the rear border of dentureDase3 said ba sestop including postdamming function as a substitute for metal rests to support the whole restoration in the correct seat on the jaw and to maintain the proper bite relation occlusion elimina ting the drift and sinking motion of said, restoration.Surther two posterior saddles 3 v united in the said base 2K are provided witb denture teeth 19, two rest onlays 5.6 are joined with labial bar,the fixed type 18 or the movable type with hinge lock Fig. 6 a 22 or the partable splitted bar Fig.6 22 .The design,function and structure of the RTI ID 15.14 basestop 4 and restonlay structure 5 6 is the same as fuzed in the partial upper restoration of Fig.3 the design of the base tissue born in the palate is free from the gingiva margin of the front teethzone 21.The function of said ba se 2 and basestop 4X 4V is to achieve an even distribution of the occlusal bite contact load and pressure eliminating the sir kingmotion and drift of restoration and securing a permanent pro per seat and articulation bite contact . The function of the labial bar 18 in front of the jaw is to sta bilise and retain the denture firmly in the front of the jaw wi thout to harm the living teeth important for later modified construction of complete restoration.The fixed type of bar joined into the posterior saddles 3Y is designed in case the jaw is free from undercut to pass the restoration without obstruction du ring the insertion,the movable bar hinge locktype is designed in case the jaw.impede the insertion of the restoration caused by se vere undercut of jaw,the partable splitted bar is designed for small sized jaw obstructed byl.tissue the proper choice of bar is previously tested on the workmodel with coldcure resin.

Illustrates a proper designed and constructed of high strength in rustfree chrome base stainless steel surgical grade dynamic dental mounting device in a handsome form of high preci sion and resistance,mounted with the restoration of invention according title and Fig.3.Said device is used to set up the den ture teeth 19 in the restoration of invention or in general den tal constructions fixed partial and full denture construction in order to achieve a harmless or proper natural bite function that means a setting up according a non interferring stressbro ken bite function articulation related to the sound articula tion theories 1 in order to accomplish the setting up of the dentureteeth in a harmoninus bite function with the natural bi te function articulation and bite contact in rest occlusion in centric of the abraded pattern of the remaining living teeth in the arch of dentition to be restored. or 2 in order to accomplish the setting up of the denture teeth relate to the horizontal articulation theorie ba ed on a determined tecnic to equilibrate the bite function on a horizontal bite level without interference of all teeth aswell natural aswell artificial of the restoration of title Pig.11. represents a vertical elevated cross section of the said dental mounting device and the restoration of title according Fig.3 in a front elevational view mounted with upper41 and lower 7x jawcasts related in centric bite contact centric occlusion Said mounting device is composed with two proper systems to im mitate the human s jaw function in a simplified and practical way 1.The first system is a mobile or loose adjustable rotable ho rizontal gliding jointstructure A B to reproduce the natural ina stication motion of the lower Jaw consisting of the bilateral si de oreward , and backward gliding motion according a rotable deterlrl ed horizontal or natural accordingr the natural abraded exiting pattern gliding motion. The upperstructureJAlrepresenting a mobile,rotable,horizontal joint is a flat planed cilynder with springactivator e ,said cy ILnder is extended in a mounting jawcast uppermember t which may be rotated freely with a horizontal or free inclined gliding motion around its joint screwpost d which fix or releases said cylinder With the flatplancd middle structure b provided with a screwseat h to join the screwpost d aswell provided with a lock device g to hold securely the structurer h rotable system in centric bite the main natural position of lother jaw in relation to the upper jaw or to hold securely the foreward bite incision function in order to perform a proper functional setting up pro cedure. 2.The second system is a mobile, rockfree and adjustable vertical gliding jointstructure B C with a translative motionCa vertical parallel motion related to the jaw cast members a , m in order to imitate and reproduce the motion of opening and closing of the lowerjaw. The hinge joint structure designed and devised in most mounting devices articulators functions with an oblique motion instead with a translative motion which is false and incorrect to im.mi tate the natural motion of jaw in order to establish a harmless non interferring free from horizontal and vertical lever effects bite function in the setting up of the restoration according ti tle and in the general dental construction colnplete denture con struction and fixed partial construction ,as well the said hinge joint structure is incorrect in order to change the bite in a lo wer or higher level in case of need or for adjusting the bite during the setting up procedure for reason of wxshrinkage. Said middle structure 3 is provided with a twinpostt, calibrated with mm to form a mobile,rockfree,telescopic unit with the lo werstructure C extended with a lower jawcast membergm holding the lower jaw cast Ix said lowerstructure C is a springloaded tutincylinder f fitting rockfree the twinpost i which permits an exact vertical parallel motion to its upperstructure A imitating the natural opening and closing bite function.Before mounting of the upper 1 and lower 1x jawcastslaccording the relation in patient s skullsin their members a,m,the dental moun ting device is supported in a position to permit a free way spa ce of 4mm space j between the upperstructure A B and loweratruc turelC by means of the space insert y flat piece fitting the space way j and the build in locksystem k , k .The function of the space insert y is 1 The removal of the space insert permits to lower properly the upper, a jawcast into a correct lowerbite level or in case of skrin kage of wax to adjust the bite stand in a proper contact with the lower jawcast 1x without to reset the denture teeth particularly in the setting up procedure of precision articulation systems the free centric articulation or flat abraded posterior teeth .2.To be used as a simplified mean of structure to secure the high precision and function of the total structure of the mounting device by maintaining solidly and permanently its vertical pa rallel motion of its members and its centric hold during the di ly use and lifetime.3.To neutralise any wobble or misalignement of the relatlowl of both members , m . Two built in locks k , k activated by releasing and closing by means of a key are devised in the lower structure C in order to permit to rise and to maintain the bite stand O of the setting up in a correct higher bite stand and to permit up and down motion of A B structures in case of need as in bite corrections or prema ture spots or rifled biteonlay structures applied in fixed or re movable partial construction.The mounting of the bite relation of uppert1 and lower 1xlmRy be re alised in two ways as in a side way according. Fig.11 for ease of view and access to control and adjust the correct bite contact O of the setting up or said bite relation is positioned according tEle conventional way in front of the device. The jawcasts are mounted with stone plaster in a proper and secu re way by means of anchor pins n and anchor seats nA devised in the members a and m .To release jawcasts without dammage to the to tal structure the upper A B and the lowerstructure CJare separa ted,the anchor Dins n are removed and the stoneplaster on the ledge of anchorseat splitted by saw cut and dislodge with knife, said jawcast relation may be replaced and dislodged plaster fi xed with super glue resin ciment on ledge of anchor seat. The Main characteristics of above detailed description of the dental mounting device are as follow 1.lts capacity to imitate the human jaw function in a practical ly ,simplified and proper way 2.lts universal use to accomplish in practise the various articu lation theories based on sound principles to restore a non inter ferring harmless bite function in the restoration of title or jn general dental constructions 3. ts correct function to hold and adjust securely title correct centric bite contact in rest centric occlusion of the upper and lower jawcasts during the setting up procedure. 4. Its sturdy compact and stabilised construction made of rust free chrome stainless steel surgical grade secures its func tion for dryly use in the laboratory,its handsome fotm fits the hand. The complete construction plan of the restoration according ti tle is classified in the procedure as follows acc. a chronolo gic order of technical steps 1, Lay out in design of a 3 saddle case upper partial according ti tle illustrated on the masterstonemodel 1 replica of patient s jaw illustrated in Fig.3 by outlining a non interferring peri phery border of the saddles involved being two posterior9and one anteriorsaddle 3X rbduced by 1.5.mm in size aswell the out line of the periphery rearborder of the base 2 including the preparation of the basestop 4 on the palate of stonemodel 1 said preparation being a smoothigroof of even depth 0.5mm 1mm,broad 3mm in a parabolic figure including a rim in the rear of den turebase 4X in dental term postdamming prepared with same measurement as base stop 4 . 2. Determination of four selected living abutmentteeth two anter ior 7X 72 and two posterior 7 7 on the mastermodel 1 ,two for each posterior saddle structuret3 in order to establish a com pleteXhorizontal circumference surveying line 9J in the tniddle of the whole toothform of all said abutment teeth. 3.The said determination as above of the proper and same comple te circunferenceline on all abutmentteeth is established by the proper tilt of the surveying table with the mastermodel I in or der to permit the circumferenceline drawn by the carbonrod of a proper dental surveyor to be marked in the middle of the whole toothform of all said abutmentteeth that means all toothsurfa ces involved as the buccal side side to cheek or the labial side side to lip or lingual side side to tongue or approximal side surface left or right . From tile tecnic step 3 the Mainrule is derived That the above said tilt of the surveying table with the mastermodel 1 will be the s me as for the determination of the design of the onlay structure aswell for the determination of the path of insertion of the re storation Fig.3 and aswell for the determination of the propcr location of the retention anchors 10 or 10X . The said carbon circumferenceline 9 Fig.9 describes a full circle line on thespheric surfaces as the buccal,lingual,labia1.,appr ximal,palatinal the real mean being specified as above of all the abutmentteeth 7 or 7X involved,dividing the said spheric surfa ces of the whole toothform of each abutmenttooth in a restzone 8 as illustrated in Fig.9 and in a retentionzone 24 .4. The determination of the design,structure,size and location of the complete onlaystructure used as substitute for the harmful metal rests.The complete onlayrest 5 6 illustrated in topview Fig.2 aw,hori zontal cross section1is composed in a buccal onlay 5 and a lin ual onlay 6 both designed in form of an arrow the arrowpoint is 1 mm thick,length is 5mm,width of joint 5X into denturetooth 19 j. 4mm,root in denturetooth is 3mm the onlay is never processed on the surface of the denturetooth but provided with a roothold . Tht complete onlay structure 5 6 is designed in the restzone 8 illustrated in Sig.8 although the lingual 6 onlayrest may be de signed in the rest and retentionzone 8 and 24 previously bloc ked out with stoneplaster in the stage of blocking out of the path of insertion. The denture tooth 20V used in combination with the onlay struc ture 5 6J i8 made of first quality hard and wear resistnt resin material based on pyolytic silicium dioxide used in the type iso sit toothstructure or as. an alternative the first denture tooth used in combination with the onlay rests may be a ceramic materi al in form of a canine processed with fracture resistant resin in the saddle structure 3W Fig.8,the other denture teeth not in involved with the onlay structure may be ceramic or hard and wear resistant resin.The onlay rest structure 5 6 Fig.2 a are waxed a little over sized in an arrowshape on the abutmentteeth 7 of mastermodel 1W Fig.8 in case of use of the ,ceramic canine denture tooth in combi nation with the onlay structure as said above said onlay struc ture will be processed in fracture resistant resin clear or gum toned,in case of the use of a hard wear resistant resin tooth as isosit denture tooth said onlay structure will be processed with isosit crown material based on pyolytic silicium dioxide resin base 5 times harder than normal resin in toothshade accor ding abutmenttooth.Said onlay structure aswell the complete res toration of title is coated with medical graded silicon oil to resist wear,discolouring ,bacterien and foodsmell during the use of restoration by the wearer.Said onlay structure may be relined in case of need.5. The surveying and determination of the proper path of insertion of the denture saddles 3 between the abutmentteeth. lportant Considering the Mainrule as said above read again page2 secure the tilt position by locking firmly and carefully thesur veyingtable with workmodel in place according the position tilt used for the determination of circumferenceline technical step 3 .The final path of insertion, l4V 14 Yig.9 is determined by means Or a proper dental surveyor and tapered surveyingrod 25 with 20 degrees angle course as illustrated in Fig.9 by positioning said rodi25 aOainst the abutmenttooth 7 and the crest of the ridge 27 two contacts are made as the contact 14 at level of circumfcrenee line 9 and the contact l4 at level of the crest line ,both con tacts are marked by scratch.The distance between the two said con tacts is the course in slope of 26 of the final path of insertion specified by numeral 14 14 .Said path 14X 14 forms an undercut area which is blocked out between the two marks with stoneplaster in thick consistency as a putty wetting of the abutmenttooth is ne cessary for hold of filling .Said putty like stoneplaster is model led with the edge of the tapered rod 25 during the setting stage in the shape of a smooth round sloping path between the marked scrat ches 14X 14 .Said tecnic of path of insertion is applied on all abutmentteeth 7 7 7 7 Fig.3 according the tilt of the circumfe rence line marked in the middle of said abutmentteeth.6.The determination of the proper location of the retention an cors 10 or 1O in the denture saddles 3 and on the abutmentteetb 7 surveyed with the circumference line 9 . Considering the Mainrule as said and considering that the said circumference line 9 marked on the total surface of the abutment teeth 7 divide the side surface of the said abutmenttoeth 7 Fig.10 in a restzone 8 and in a retentionzone 24 a small amount of title undercut material stoneplaster in the retentionzone 24 is reces sd with a scalpel blade to provide a recess 25 Fig.10 half the size of anchor 10 in the centre of the circumferenceline 9 for correct positioning of the retention anchor 10 or 10X in case of anterior and to provide proper retention for anchorarm 12 as be ing 1 mm 2mm under the circumference line,said recess has 2mm height and 9 mm length,1 2mm horizontal dépthtlateral undercut depth which fits the size of anchorarm. 12 .
