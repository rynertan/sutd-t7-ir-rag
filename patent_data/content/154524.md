# Process for manufacturing a magnetic bubble memory chip.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing a dual spacing type magne tic bubble memory chip having a thin garnet film 10 , on which a first area 14 is provided with minor loop transmis sion lines 18 for memorizing bubble information and a second area 15 is provided with major transmission lines 18 for recording or reading out the bubble information. The process comprises forming a first insulative layer 11 SiO₂ on the garnet film 19 over the first 14 and second 15 areas, forming conductive patterns 12 on the SiO₂ layer, coating the SiO₂ layer and conductive patterns with a second insulative layer 13 of resin PLOS and thermoset ting the coated insulative layer 13 , removing by etching the entire depth of part of the SiO₂ 12 and PLOS 13 layers, which exist on the first area 14 , forming a third insulative layer 17 SiO₂ over the whole surface including the first 14 and second 15 areas, and forming the minor loop transmission lines 18 and the major transmission lines 18 on the third insulative layer 17 . By etching back to the thin garnet film 10 and then depositing the third insulative layer 17 onto it, the upper surface of the layer 17 in the first area 17 is both flat and spaced by an accurately predetermined distance and hence so are the lines 18 .
