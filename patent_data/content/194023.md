# Process for the electrochemical carbonylation of aromatic nitro compounds.

## Abstract
Aromatic nitro compounds nitrobenzene or 2,4 dinitro toluene are subjected to electrochemical carbonylation by means of a biomass electrolyte. A bias dc potential is applied between an anode 16 and cathode 19 separated by an ion permeable membrane 3 . Aromatic nitro compound 35 and carbon dioxide 24 are supplied to and react at the cathode, and biomass electrolyte 42 is supplied to and reacts at the anode. Nitrobenzene is converted into nitrobenzoic acid or phenyl isocyanate, and 2,4 dinit rotoluene is converted into toluene diisocyanate.
