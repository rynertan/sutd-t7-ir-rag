# Means of controlling the condition of air in an enclosure.

## Abstract
Air in an enclosure 13 e.g. a greenhouse, is conditioned by apparatus which includes a brine reservoir 11 , a direct contact air brine vapor heat exchanger 12 , a brine evapor ator 16 , and a brine circulation system for exchanging brine between the reservoir and heat exchanger along path B , and between the reservoir and the evaporator along path C . The apparatus also includes a condenser 17 operatively associated with the evaporator 16 , a primary air circulation system constructed and arranged to exchange air between the heat exchanger and the enclosure along path A for drying the air in the heat exchanger, and a secondary air circulation system constructed and arranged to exchange air between the evaporator and the condenser for evaporating water from the brine in the evaporator. Water vapor produced by the brine evaporator 16 is condensed in the condenser 17 which is constructed and arranged to transfer the heat released by condensation, which is the same as the latent heat of vaporization of water evaporated from the brine by the vaporizer, to the air in the enclosure 13 . A method of conditioning air in an enclosure is also disclosed.
