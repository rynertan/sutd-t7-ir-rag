## Description
SKIN TREATMENT COMPOSITION The invention relates to antiperspirant compositions for topical application to human skin. More particularly the invention relates to antiperspirant compositions which can be dispensed from valved aerosol containers, or pump spray dispensers or roll ball applicators to be deposited onto the skin in particulate form, or as a film or layer. These compositions are based on moisture absorbent materials which are generally non astringent in nature and which help to make the composition substantially nonstaining and milder to the skin. Conventional antiperspirant compositions traditionally contain an astringent, such as aluminium chlorhydrate, zirconium oxychloride aluminium hydroxychloride complex or zinc phenol sulphonate, which is believed to depress the formation of perspiration from sweat glands. These astringents are commonly applied to the skin in the form of an aerosol spray. We have now devised an entirely new type of composition for limiting the manifestation of perspiration on the skin which does not necessarily require the use of astringent perspiration depressants, such as those exemplified above, and which can therefore reduce the irritating eifect that astringents and their by products sometimes produce. Therefore, instead of relying entirely on chemical suppression of perspiration at source, we employ a means whereby perspiration can be absorbed at the skin surface as soon as it is formed, thus maintaining the skin in an apparently dry condition.This is achieved by applying to the skin a composition containing a special polymer having a high capacity for absorbing superficial skin moisture, together with a substance which controls the moisture absorbing capacity of the polymer, which improves its adhesion to the skin and which enhance its superficial tactile properties. It follows that transfer of perspiration from the skin to adjacent clothing can also be limited or prevented completely by this means which is at least as effective as conventional astringent antiperspirant materials, but which does not suffer from the disadvantages associated with such materials. Extensive laboratory investigations and in vivo trials involving human subjects have been directed to the problems of controlling the degree to which the polymer absorbs water and of enhancing the substantivity of the polymer to the skin and its superficial tactile properties. Early investigations showed, for example, that although a polymer might intrinsically be capable of absorbing an amount of water equal to many times its own weight, the swelling of the polymer on the skin as it absorbed perspiration caused it to become obtrusive to the extent that the subject expressed a dislike of the feel of the swollen polymer on the skin. It was also observed that a film or layer of the polymer when applied to the skin lacked sufficient substantivity to remain intact on the skin over an extended period of time, for example during a working day. Body movement and contact by clothing adjacent to the treated area of skin tended to afraid the film or layer of polymer such that it would roll up or flake off the skinewith consequent loss of antiperspirancy. It was furthermore noted by human subjects that the feel of the film or layer of the polymer lacked the desirable smoothness which was necessary if the presence of the polymer on the skin was to remain unobtrusive.A slight roughness of the film or layer of polymer would, for example, tend to catch on adjacent clothing and skin this vas considered to be an undesirable attribute. The problems of how to control moisture uptake, how to improve substantivity and how to improve feel have no been solved by including a special surfactant in the composition. The invention accordingly provides an antiperspirant composition comprising from 0.1 to 30 p by weight of a moisture absorbent water insoluble polymer which is substantially dry to the touch when swollen with water and which has a water absorption value of at least 2, from 0.1 to 15 by weight of a surfactant having a melting point of from 30 to 75 C, and from 1 to 99.8cos by weight of an organic solvent in which the polymer is substantially insoluble. The invention also provides a process for preparing an antiperspirant composition which comprises mixing together the moisture absorbent water insoluble polymer, the surfactant and the organic solvent as herein defined. The invention also provides a method for absorbing per .ziration which comprises applying topically to the skirl particularly in the region of apocrine sweat glands, an attiperspirant composition as herein defined. The moisture absorbent water insoluble polymer will generally have a water absorption value of at least two, preferably from 5 to 500 and most preferably from 10 to 50. TL water absorption value of a polymer is measured by spraying it in a finely divided dry state onto a tared filter pa r using an anhydrous propellant as a vehicle.After allo.ng the propellant to evaporate, the filter paper is we ghed again to give the dry weight of the polymer whic has been deposited. Water is hen sprayed onto the reverse side of the filter paper until the deposited polymer is just wet to the touch and a appears wet when observing the reflectance of r eam of light directed onto the top surface of the p vmer layer. The paper is weighed again to give the wet weight of the polymer and hence the amount of water absorbed by the polymer. The water ab .ption value is given by the weight of water absorbed by polymer divided by the dry weight of the polymer. The polymer is ltterably chosen from one or more of the following polymers a a cross linked starch b other anionic polyelectrolytes, and c a base hydrolysed starch polyacrylonitrile graft copolymer. More specifically, an example oi the cross linked starch is a substantially water insoluble cross linked gelatinised starch, in which the degree of substitution oi the cross linking groups is 0.001 to 0.04, which is preferably, but not necessarily, substituted by ionic groups attached to the starch by ether linkages, these groups, when present, being associated with mono or di valent counterions. Although the degree oi substitution oi the crosslinking groups can be relatively low, the cross linked starch is substantially insoluble in water. The cross linking of the starch molecules may be effected by ether bridges of the formula O R O , whereR is an aliphatic group, which may be substituted by one or more hydroxy groups, containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms.Preferably R is CE2C11 oR cH2 , which is the case when the starch is cross linked using epichlorhydrin as.crosslinking agent. The ionic groups, when present, preferably have the formula Z R1 and R1 is an alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and Z is an anionic group selected from carboxyl, sulphonic or phosphonic groups or a cationic group of the formula EMI7.1 where R2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, and R3 and R4 are lower alkyl or are alkylene groups linked together to form a five or six membered heterocyclic ring. Particularly suitable materials are those wherein R1 is an alkylene group containing 1 or 2 carbon atoms and Z is COO and preferred materials are carboxymethylated cross linked gelatinised starches. When the polymer is substituted by ionic groups, the degree of substitution of the ionic groups will generally be at least 0.1 and is desirably at least 0.2 to obtain the preferred higher water absorption values. When Z is an anionic group, the counterion preferably is an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium ion. The substituted ammonium derivatives may be those in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by C1 4 alkyl or C24 hydroxyalkyl groups or in which the nitrogen atom forms part of a heterocyclic ring. An example of such a substituted ammonium ion is tetramethylammonium. Preferred counterions when Z is an anionic group are the sodium, pottasium and ammonium ions. When Z is a cationic group, the counterion may be, for example, chloride, bromide or sulphate. Particularly preferred absorbent materials of this invention are the sodium and ammonium salts of carboxyl nethylated epichlorhydrin cross linked gelatinised starch having a water absorption value of at least 5 and being insoluble in water to the extent of at least 99 by weight.The sodium or ammonium salts are hereinafter referred to in the examples as sodium cross linked starch or nammonium cross linked starch respectively. Cross linked gelatinised starch can be prepared by the process described in our British Patent ApplicationNo 2118 77. Examples of the anionic polyelectrolyte, other than the cross linked starches as hereinbefore defined, which are alternative polymers having a water absorption value of at least 2 are water insoluble ionic complexes of a water soluble anionic polyelectrolyte and a polyvalent metal cation having a valency of at least three, the cation being present in the amount of 0.01 to 5.0 milliequivalents per gram of polyelectrolyte. The polyelectrolyte generally contains anionic groups, such as carboxylate, sulphonate, sulphate and phosphate groups or mixtures thereof. Preferably the polyelectrolyte is polyacrylic acid. The cation is a transition metal, preferably aluminium, iron, chromium, zirconium, titanium or mixtures thereof.The cation is preferably present in the amount of 0.1 to 1.0 nillequivalents per gram of polyelectrolyte. A particularly preferred polyelectrolyte is polyacrylic acid having from 40 to 85 of its carboxylate groups neutralised, the cation being aluminium which is present in the amount of from 0.1 to 1.0 milliequivalents per gram of polyelectrolyte. These polyelectrolytes and their preparation are further described in German Patent Application DTULS No 2 609 144 National Starch and Chemical Corporation . Further examples of the anionic polyelectrolyte are r√ßater insoluble covalently cross linked anionic polyelectrolytes. The anionic polyelectrolytes can be water soluble polyelectrolytes which are covalentXy cross linked to render them insoluble yet capable of absorbing water. Examples oi these water soluble anionic polyelectrolytes to be covalently cross linked are natural polymers, such as anionic derivatives of starch and cellulose, and synthetic polymers such as carboxylic homopolymers or copolymers containing at least 20 mole per cent carboxylic acid units such as polyacrylic acid. Examples of the covalent cross linking compounds which can be copolymerised with the polyelectrolytes are divinyl compounds, such as divinyl benzene, divinyl diethylene glycol dither, divinyl diphenyl silicone and divinyl sulphone allyl compounds, such as triallyl cyanurate, trimethylol propane diallyl ether, allyl methacrylate, allyl acrylate, allyl crotonate, diallylphthalate, diallyl succinate and diallyl sucrose polyfunctional acrylates and methacrylates, such as tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, penta erythritol tetra acrylate, ethylidene dimethylacrylate and trimethylol propane trimethacrylate and polyfunctional arylamides and methacrylamides, such asN,N methylene bis acrylamide and N,N methylene bismethacrylamide. These water insoluble covalently cross linked anionic polyelectrolytes and their preparation are further described in Netherlands Patent Application No 7 604 518 National Starch and Chemical Corporation . Any of the water insoluble anionic polyelectrolyte complexes as herein described can be surface treated with a polyvalent metal cation to maximise absorption by the polymer particles of moisture. The preferred polyvalent metal cations for surface treatment are aluminium, zirconium, chromium, titanium and zinc. These surface treated water insoluble anionic polyelectrolyte complexes and their preparation are also further described in Netherlands Patent Application No 7 604 518 National Starch and Chemical Corporation . An example of a surface treated anionic polyelectrolyte is National Starch Resyn 78 3803 which is potassium polyacrylate cross linked with aluminium. Examples of the base hydrolysed starch polyacrylonitrile graft copolymer are those comprising water insoluble alkali metal salts of saponified gelatinised starch and saponified polyacrylonitrile in mole ratios of from 1 1.5 to 1 9. Copolymers such as these are identified and prepared by the methods set out in Journal of AppliedPolymer Science, Volume 13, pages 2007 2017 1969 , andVolume 15, pages 3015 3024 1971 . The moisture absorbent polymer should be in the form of a finely divided powder having a particle size not greater than 100lp, preferably not greater than 60 u. The quantity of the moisture absorbent polymer to be employed is generally at least 0.1, usually from 0.1 to 30 by weight of the composition, but the actual amount chosen will depend on the nature of that composition and the water absorption value of the polymer. Preferably, the amount of polymer is from 0.5 to 20 , most preferably from 1 to 15 by weight of the composition. It is apparent that compositions containing less than 0.1 by weight of the composition of polymer are unlikely to perform effectively as antiperspirants, whereas where the polymer forms more than 30 by weight of the composition, the composition may be difficult to dispense or the amount of polymer deposited on the skin when the composition is used as an antiperspirant may be excessive leading to poor consumer acceptance. The composition also comprises a surfactant having a 0 0 melting point of from 30 to 75 C. Preferred examples of the surfactant are cetyl alcohol, iso cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, palmitic acid, glycerol monolaurate, ethoxylated fattyAlcohols and mixtures thereof. The most preferred surfactants are nonionic surfactants. It is important to ensure that the chosen surfactant has a melting point within the defined range, since it is the surfactant which influences the ability of the polymer to absorb moisture, improves its substantivity to the skin and enhances the feel of the polymer on the skin. It has for example been shown that when the surfactant is one which has a melting point oi less than 300C, it adversely affects the behaviour of the polymer on the skin in three ways. Firstly, the particles of the polymer in contact with the skin can, under certain circumstances, agglomerate secondly, the substantivity of the polymer on the skin can be poor, and thirdly moisture uptake by the polymer on the skin can lack the necessary control to optimise both moisture uptake and swelling of the polymer. It should be explained that agglomeration can occur in the presence of a low melting point surfactant in the following manner. The particles of polymer when first applied to the skin will usually form a smooth film, but as they absorb moisture, for example from perspiration, the particles will generally tend to migrate towards each other on the skin surface to form adhering groups of particles known as agglomerates. This is apparently due to the inability of the low melting point surfactant to hold the particles in place on the skin. As perspiration evaporates, the polymer particles revert to the dry state, but because of agglomeration a rough sand paper texture results. The polymer now forms an abrasive textured layer on the skin which is unacceptable to the consumer. It should also be explained that the agglomerated polymer exhibits poor substantivity to the skin, because the agglomerates are heavier than the individual particles of the polymer and hence are more easily dislodged from the skin. It should also be explained that when the surfactant has a melting point of less than 30 C, it is urable to reduce moisture uptake from the skin by. particles of a polymer having a high water absorption value. It is therefore likely that excessive swelling of the polymer will lead to the formation of an obtrusive layer on the skin which is unacceptable because the presence of the film can then be felt by the user. It has also been shown that if the melting point of the surfactant exceeds 750C, it can coat the polymer particles on the skin to such an extent that moisture uptake by the polymer is severely hampered, with the result that there can be inadequate control oieperspiration. It follows that the choice of a surfactant which has a melting point of from 30 to 750C restricts mobility of the polymer particles on the skin as moisture is absorbed and maintains adequate adherences of the particles to the skin without excessively restricting their ability to absorb moisture from the skin. The quantity of surfactant to be employed is generally from 0.1 to 15s, preferably from 0.1 to 10 by weight of the composition. Compositions containing less than 0.1 by weight of a surfactant will tend to be less substantive to the skin than is desirable and will also lack the sufficient control of moisture uptake and so can lead to a film or layer of polymer on the skin which is too obtrusive on absorption of moisture. Compositions containing more than 15 by weight of a surfactant can contribute excessively to the apparent greasiness of the film or layer of polymer on the skin and can severely restrict absorption of moisture with consequent loss of effectiveness of the antiperspirant composition. The composition also comprises an organic solvent in which the polymer is substantially insoluble. The function of the solvent is to provide the composition with sufficient mobility to distribute the polymer conveniently and uniformly on the skin. The solvent should, however, be capable of subsequently evaporating from the skin within a few minutes, so that the composition is then dry to the touch, without residual wetness or greasiness derived from the solvent. The solvent should accordingly have a boiling point no higher than 150 C, preferably no higher than 1000C. Examples of solvents are ethyl alcohol, methylene chloride, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, low boiling liquid paraiiins, such as pentane, hexane, heptane and octane, volatile silicones such as linear and cyclic polydimethyl siloxanes. The solvent can also be a propellant such as trichloroiluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotrifluoroethane, monochlorodifluoromethane, trichlorotrifluoroethane, propane, butane, isobutane, dimethylether and carbon dioxide. The solvent will generally comprise at least 1 , preferably from 55 to 99.sue by weight of the composition, the amount actually selected generally forming the balance of the composition after accounting for the polymer, the surfactant and any optional ingredients that may also be included in the formulation. The composition can also optionally comprise an emollient which, if present, is preferably a non hydroxylic emollient, although certain hydroxylic emollients can be employed. The emollient will generally have a melting point of less than 20 C. Preferred examples of non hydroxylic emollients are isopropylmyristate, isopropyl palmitate and dibutylphthalate. Preferred examples of hydroxylic emollients are 2 ethyl 1,3 hexane diol and hexylene glycol. The quantity Of emollient when included in the composition is generally up to 30 , preferably from 5 to 20 , most preferably from 8 to 10 by weight of the composition. The composition can also optionally comprise a suspending agent which, if present, is one which is hydrophobically treated, for example, hydrophobically treated montmorillonite clays. It should be explained that montmorillonite clays are clays that contain the mineral montmorillonite, and are characterised by having an expanded lattice. An example is bentonite. Bentonite is colloidal hydrated aluminium silicate obtained from montmorillonite and has the formula Al2034SiO20112O. A more detailed discussion of bentonites can be found in the Xirk Othmer Encyclopedia of ChemicalTechnology, 2nd Edition, Vol 3, 1964 pp 339 360, published by Interscience Publishers. Examples of bybr ophobically treated bentonites areBENTONE 27 which has the structure EMI17.1 and BENTONE 38 which has the structureEMI17.2 BENTONITES are available from the National LeadCompany. Montmorillonite clays can also be prepared synthetically and can be treated with long chain amines to render them hydrophobic. An example is the hydrophobic form of LAPONITE available from Laporte Industries. Further examples of suspending agellts are Arawax C an ethylene diamine condensate with 2 mols stearic acid , zinc ricinoleate, zinc stearate and Aerosil 200 l pyrotenic silica and sodium stearate. The quantity of suspending agents that can optionally be employed is generally up to 8 by weight of the composition. The composition can also optionally comprise a deodorant. Examples of deodorants are sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, aluminium chlorhydrate, aluminium sulphate and zinc ricinoleate. It will be appreciated that astringent aluminium salts such as the sulphate and chlorhydrate will, if present, also function asanti perspirants. The deodorant, if present, can comprise from 0.1 to 20 by weight of the composition. The antiperspirant composition can take the form of a propellant based aerosol product or it can be employed in the absence of a propellant in a pump spray dispenser.Alternatively,. the antiperspirant composition can be a lotion containing the polymer suspended or dispersed therein for direct application to the skin with a swab or with the use of a roll ball applicator. The invention accordingly also comprises an applicator or other container containing the antiperspirant composition as herein defined. Compositions of the invention can be prepared by mixing together the polymer, the surfactant and the solvent and optional ingredients to provide a homogeneous dispersion of the solid particulate polymer in a liquid phase. According to a preferred process, when the solvent comprises an aerosol propellant and a suspending agent is included, the suspending agent is first sheared with the propellant and then the mixture is blended with the other components previously filled into aerosol containers. The compositions of the invention can be employed as antiperspirants to reduce or eliminate perspiration as it appears at the skin surface. According to a preferred method, the composition is applied to the skin, in particular where apocrine sweat glands are abundant, for example in the axillae, and in the genital and anal regions of the body, the film, layer or deposit of polymer so formed providing a means whereby perspiration is absorbed as it reaches the skin surface without the polymer becoming sticky when swollen with the moisture present in perspiration. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following Examples. Example 1 This example illustrates a propellant based antiperspirant composition according to the invention. The formulation of the composition was as follows s wlwCetyl alcohol surfactant 1Bentone 38 suspending agent 0.6Isopropyl myristate emollient 2Ethanol solvent 0.3 Ammonium cross linked starch polymer 3 5 Sodium bicarbonate deodorant 1.5Trichlorofluoromethan Propellant 11 solvent 45.55 Monochlorodifluoromethane Propellant 12 solvent 45.55 In preparing this composition, the suspending agent was first milled with the propellant and this mixture was then blended with the other ingredients of the composition which had already been filled into aerosol containers. The containers were then fitted with conventional aerosol valves. This composition when sprayed onto the axillae provided a sufficient protection against the appearance of perspiration for a period of at least 8 hours. The layer of polymer remained in close adherence to the skin and had a pleasant, smooth and unobtrusive feel. It was not noticeable when swollen with perspiration moisture and did not transfer to adjacent clothing.

The film also has a considerable capacity for absorbing skin moisture and remains dry and non sticky and does not disintegrate when swollen with water present in skin moisture. The film furthermore has a pleasant silky smooth feel which is unobtrusive even when the polymer is swollen with perspiration moisture. The film also has the ability to regenerate by losing absorbed moisture by evaporation so that it is again ready to absorb further skin moisture.
