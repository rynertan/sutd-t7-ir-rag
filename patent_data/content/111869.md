# Process for forming a ferrite film.

## Abstract
A process for forming a ferrite film, which is characte rized in that in an aqueous solution containing at least ferrous ions as metal ions, ferrous hydroxide ions FeOH or FeOH and other metal hydroxide ions, are uniformly adsorbed on the surface of a solid by an interfacial reaction at an interfacial boundary between the solid and the aqueous solution and the adsorbed FeOH is oxidized to FeOH² , whereupon FeOH² and metal hydroxide ions in the aqueous solution undergo a ferrite crystallization reaction to precipi tate a ferrite layer on the surface of the solid.
