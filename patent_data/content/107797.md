# An input circuit for converting an a.c. input voltage to a logic level voltage.

## Abstract
The input circuit 10 includes a rectifier 12 for convert ing a sensed a.c. voltage which is supplied through a coupling impedance 20 to the light emitter 20 of an optical isolator 30 . While the a.c. voltage is below a first predeter mined voltage, a switchable low impedance circuit path 46, 48 in parallel with the light emitter is rendered conductive to maintain a low voltage across the light emitter to prevent it from becoming conductive until the sensed a.c. voltage reaches the predetermined voltage. A switchable high impedance circuit path 52, 54 in parallel with the low impedance circuit path 46, 48 becomes conductive once the a.c. voltage reaches the first predetermined voltage to place a high voltage across the light emitter 28 to exhibit a sharp turn on . The high impedance circuit path 52, 54 remains conductive to keep the light emitter 28 energized until the a.c. voltage drops to a second predetermined voltage so that the light emitter exhibits a sharp turn off .
