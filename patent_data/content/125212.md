# Trip mechanism with a controlled burst fire device for firearms.

## Abstract
The trip mechanism makes it possible, by means of an appropriate fire selector, to fire either a single shot or control led bursts comprising three or more shots every time the trigger of the firearm is pulled. It can be fitted to any firearm. The mechanism comprises a ratchet wheel 3 pivoted on the receiver 4 of the firearm and having a plurality of trip teeth 24 , 25 , 26 corresponding to the number of shots to be fired with a burst, adapted to engage a trip tooth 27 carried by the trigger 1 . The ratchet wheel 3 is also provided with a correspond ing number of lugs 28 , 29 , 30 adapted to engage a tongue 31 pivoted on the bolt 2 by means of a pin 32 . A bolt stopping element 2 pivoted on the receiver 4 of the arm has a first trip tooth 19 adapted to co operate with a catch 20 on the bolt 21 and a second trip tooth 13 disposed at an end of an arm 9 pivoted on the trigger 1 and biased by a spring 10 with its other end against the pin 5 of the trigger 1 . This pin has a flat section 6 and is connected to a control member 7 exterior to the arm by means of which the pin 5 can be brought from a position in which it abuts the arm 9 by means of its cylindrical surface to a position in which it abuts the arm 9 by means of its flat section 6 .
