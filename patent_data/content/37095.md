# Tools for drilling, reaming and the like with simultaneous angular and linear oscillatory motions.

## Abstract
A dental contra angle which supports a tool socket for combined motion consisting of two oscillatory movements simultaneously, one motion being a linear reciprocating motion parallel to the axis of rotation, and the other motion being an oscillatory motion around the axis of rotation. For that purpose the rotational motion of the drive shaft is converted into the combined oscillatory motions of the tool operating sleeve 8 through the slot 24 in the hub 2 , the link 3 and the ring 9 .
