## Description
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions. More specifically this invention relates to anti bacterial pharmaceutical compositions which may be administered by injection. U.K. Patent No.1508977 describes clavulanic acid, of formula I EMI1.1 and its salts, and the use of such compounds as synergists for penicillin and cephalosporins. The administration of such synergistic formulations by injection is also described, the injectable compositions being made up by the addition of water to the synergistic formulations. It has been found that certain of these injectable compositions lose potency fairly quickly on reconstitution with water so that they have to be administered shortly after this reconstitution. It is an object of this invention to provide an injectable pharmaceutical composition having improved stability relative to the hereinbefore described compositions. This object is attained by the inclusion of a specific polyvinylpyrrolidone in the compositions. Accordingly the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which on reconstitution with water yields an injectable solution, which composition comprises a water soluble salt of clavulanic acid, a water soluble salt of an a amino penicillin or cephalosporii and polyvinylpyrrolidone of molecular weight 1000 to 12000. The polyvinylpyrrolidone hereafter referred to as PVP used in this invention will have a molecular weight of from 1000 to 12000. Since the material is a polymer it will be realised by a chemist that the molecular weight referred to is an average molecular weight. A suitably method of determining the average molecular weight of PVP for use in this invention is gel permeation chromatography. The PVP should not contain molecules with a molecular weight of more than 39,000. Similarly it should not have a monomer content of more than 1 . The K value of suitable PVP will generally be between 10 and 18. Favourably the PVP employed will have a molecular weight of 1500 to 6000. A preferred PVP for use in this invention will have a molecular weight of 2000 3500. A PVP of this kind is Kollidon CE 5080 Kollidon is a Registered TradeMark which is available from BASF Aktiengesellschaft,D 6700 Ludwigshafen, Federal Republic of Germany. ThisPVP has a K value of 12 to 14 which is a favoured range. Normally the weight ratio of active ingredients taken as the free acid equivalent weight to PVP in the compositions of the invention will be 1 0.25 to 1 5, more suitably 1 0.5 to 1 3. The ratio of clavulanate salt to penicillin or cephalosporin salt present in the composition will normally be in the range 10 1 to 1 10, usually in the range 1 5 to 1 1, and will preferably be 1 2. These ratios are weight weight ratios based on free acid equivalent weights . Suitably the clavulanate salt will be the sodium or potassium salt, preferably the potassium salt. Suitably the penicillin or cephalosporin salt is the sodium or potassium salt, preferably the sodium salt. a Amino penicillins and cephalosporins have a side chain of structure II EMI3.1 joined at the 6 or 7 position respectively . A particularly useful class of such penicillins and cephalosporins has R in structure II beingphenyl, p hydroxyphenyl or cyclohexadienyl. Examples of such penicillins include ampicillin and amoxycillin, and of such cephalosporins include cephradine. It has been found that this invention is particularly pertinent to formulations wherein the penicillin is amoxycillin. Thus one preferred embodiment of this invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising sodium or potassium clavulanate, sodium or potassium amoxycillin, and PVP. In this preferred embodiment the relative proportions of the ingredients are suitably as hereinbefore described. Most preferably in this embodiment the active ingredients are potassium clavulanate and sodium amoxycillin. It has been found that the compositions of this invention can also usefully contain a water soluble solid acidic material. Suitable examples of such materials include organic acids such as citric, tartaric, malic, ascorbic, gluconic, maleic, succinic and aconitic acids.Preferably such acids will not contain a hydroxy group.It is presently believed that maleic acid is one of the most preferred organic acids to include in the compositions of the invention. Suitable acidic materials also include inorganic materials such as sodium dihydrogen phosphate. When the aforesaid acidic materials are present in the compositions, then suitably the weight ratio of active ingredients as free acid to acidic material is in the range 100 1 to 10 1, more suitably 75 1 to 25 1. Generally we have found that, when an acidic material is present, higher proportions of the acid can be used when higher proportions of PVP are present. The compositions of this invention may be reconstituted with an aqueous solvent, such as water, in conventional manner, the ingredients either being dissolved simultaneously or consecutively. It will be appreciated that as the compositions of this invention are to be used only after reconstitution into a solution, then the physical form of the ingredients of the compositions, and when appropriate the homogeneity of mixtures thereof, is not of fundamental importance to the invention. Thus while conveniently powdered ingredients and when appropriate intimate powder mixtures are used, we have found that the product of the process described in our copending Patent Application of even date entitled A process for the preparation of sodium amoxycillin claiming priority from U.K. Patent Application No.47744 78, filed 8th December, 1978, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference , may also be used. This product is a powder comprising a solid solution of a water soluble salt of amoxycillin in the PVP. The compositions of this invention will normally be presented in a glass vial. Such vials may be filled in conventional manner with the desired active ingredient and PVP in powder form. However conveniently as a first step a solution of the clavulanate salt is freeze dried in situ in the vial and the other ingredients added to the resultant plug. It will be appreciated that for the sake of ease of reconstitution the composition is preferably presented in vials, each of which vials contain a unit dose of the composition. The compositions of this invention may be used in the manner described in U.K. Patent No. 1508977. In a further aspect, the invention provides a method of improving the stability of an aqueous injectable solution of a water soluble salt of clavulanic acid and a water soluble salt of an a amino penicillin or cephalosporin, which method comprises incorporating in the solution PVP of molecular weight 1000 to 12000.
