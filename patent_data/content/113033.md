# PROCESS FOR FORMING RESIST MASKS

## Abstract
The resist masks are formed by depositing a first layer of a blanket exposed positive resist on a substrate and over coating the first layer with a second layer of an unexposed positive resist containing an aromatic sensitizer such as pyrene or one of its derivatives. The coated substrate is then image wise exposed in a desired pattern and developed after a baking step to improve adhesion of the resist.
