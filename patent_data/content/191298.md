# 1,6 Naphthyridin 2 1H ones useful as cardiotonics and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Naphthyridin 2 1 H ones, having the formula I CHEM or salts thereof, where Z is hydrogen or cyano, and Q is 2 or 3 furanyl, 2 or 3 thienyl, 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two methyl substituents, are useful as cardiotonic agents and corresponding compounds where Z is carboxy are useful as intermediates. Also shown as intermediates are 5 Q CO 6 2 di lower alkylamino ethenyl 2 1H pyridinones II or salts thereof, where Q is defined as above. A process for preparing the compounds I comprises reacting a compound II with formamidine, ammonia or a salt thereof.
