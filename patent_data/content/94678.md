# Noise erasing method in radiation image recording and reproducing method.

## Abstract
After a radiation image stored in a stimulable phosphor sheet is read out, first erasing is conducted to erase radiation energy remaining in the stimulable phosphor sheet, and then second erasing is conducted to erase fog developing in the stimulable phosphor sheet immediately before the stimul able phosphor sheet is again used for recording a radiation image. The exposure amount in the second erasing is controlled according to the time interval between the first erasing and the second erasing.
