# Aqueous coating composition based on a cationic amino urea resin, process for applying and baking the composition.

## Abstract
The invention provides an aqueous coating composition based on a cationic amino urea resin having an amine number of 3 250 and obtained by reacting an organic isocyanate with a polyamino amide having an amine number of 40 500 and built up from a mono or dicarboxylic acid and a polyamine, said composition also containing a solid particulate epoxy group containing compound and or a solid particulate polyester having a melting point of at least 40 C. The invention also pertains to the process for applying and baking said composition and to the coated substrate thus obtained.
