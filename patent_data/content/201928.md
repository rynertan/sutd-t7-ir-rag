# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING METHANE GAS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for producing methane gas from organic solid materials in existence in industrial and living wastes, in which the organic materials are finely ground by mill means while water or organic suspension is added from injection means in order to prepare a slurry, in which the slurry is deaired by deairing means to obtain raw liquid for generating methane gas in high concentration, and in which the digestive tank receives the raw liquid and treating it by anaerobic bacteria to generate the methane gas.
