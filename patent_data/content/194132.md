# IMAGING IMMUNOASSAY DETECTION SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
Light generated by one or more chemical reactions in a dis crete array is determined, both as to emissions per reaction and as to relative location of the reactions, e.g. using a system com prising a sample carrier having spaced apart discrete areas each containing a reactant capable of emitting light photons if a reaction takes place a photon receiver, for receiving photons emitted from each reaction simultaneously and a signal generator coupled to the photon receiver, for generating a signal representing the x y location of each reac tion. The signal generator may be a photomultiplier, charge coupled device or vidicon tube. The invention is particularly suited to the determination of reactions and non reactions, e.g. between an array of labelled antibodies and a specimen poten tially containing one or more complementary antigens, in an im munoassay.
