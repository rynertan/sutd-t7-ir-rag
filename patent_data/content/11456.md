# Organotin compounds and resins or polymers stabilized therewith.

## Abstract
The novel organotin compounds contain a at least one tin atom linked to one or two groups G chosen from hydrocarbyl groups or substituted hydrocarbyl groups, the group G or each group G being bonded to Sn through C b at least one mercaptoalkanol residue bonded to Sn through the S atom of the said residue, the O atom of the said residue being bonded to one of H, optionally substituted hydrocarbyl, the residue obtained by removal of the OH portion of one COOH group of a polycarboxylic or hydroxypolycarboxylic acid, Al, B, P, Si or Ti or the residue of a compound of Al, B, P, Si or Ti that contains at least one group capable of displacing the H atom of an OH group bonded to a C atom, with the proviso that the moiety of any polycarboxylic acid so used is bonded to at least two mercaptoalkanol residues through an O atom of the said residues and a CO group of said polycarboxylic acid moiety c up to 52 by weight of tin, and d up to 63 by weight of sulphur. The compounds are useful stabilizers for resins or polymers, especially halogen containing resins or polymers such as P.V.C. which can be heat stabilized therewith.
