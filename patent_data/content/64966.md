# Vacuum device for separating refractory metal from magnesium metal and or magnesium chloride mixed therewith.

## Abstract
In a vacuum separator for refractory metal from magne sium metal and magnesium chloride mixed therewith com prising a vertically elongated substantially cylindrical retort 2 having, inside, a closed space, a lower section 8 of which is capable of accommodating such mixture to be treated as held in a container 12 and is provided with a heating means 4 to evaporate the magnesium metal and magnesium chloride to a substantial part, and an upper section 9 of which has a cooling means 10 to provide, inside, a cylindrical face for condensing thereon magnesium metal and magnesium chloride which ascend as vapor, and a means 15 for degassing the retort to an elevated level of vacuum, an improvement such that a heat shield unit 16 is provided at an intermediate level between said upper 9 and lower sections 8 of the retort 2 , said heat shield unit comprising, as a whole, opening 18 so arranged as to block any direct sight of the surface of the retort lower section when holding the container 12 from a substantial part of the condensation face in the upper section, thus intercepting a substantial part of primary heat radiation from the retort lower section, while allowing passage of ascending vapor.
