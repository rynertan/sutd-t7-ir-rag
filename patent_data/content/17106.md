# Automatic analyzer for combustible gas in oil.

## Abstract
An automatic analyzer 26 for measuring a combustible gas dissolved in an oil such as an insulating oil in a transformer 1 comprises a gas desorbing device 15 a gas discharger 19 and a combustible gas detector 25 . The oil is sampled and the gas dissolved in the oil is desorbed by bubbling air and a mixed gas of the desorbed gas and air is fed into a bellows type gas discharger 19 and the concentration of the combustible gas is measured by the combustible gas detector 25 .
