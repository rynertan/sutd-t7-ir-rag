# RESIN COMPOSITION.

## Abstract
A resin composition comprising 60 to 97 of a heat meltable, fully aromatic copolyester represented by general formula I wherein d, e, f 0, e f 0.90 to 1.10, and n represents 0 or 1 and 3 to 40 wt of a polyarylate. The fully aromatic copolyester has excellent heat resistance and fluidity at proper working temperatures, but has the defect that it provides moldings of poor appearance and a lowered impact strength. Blending of the polyarylate serves to re move the defect without detriment to the heat resistance.
