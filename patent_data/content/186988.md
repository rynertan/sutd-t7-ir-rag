# Improved impregnation suspension system for expandable styrene maleic anhydride particles.

## Abstract
The absorption of water by styrene maleic anhydride co polymer particles during the impregnation of the particles with hydrocarbon blowing agent in aqueous suspension is greatly reduced by the addition of salt to the impregnation system. This process produces expandable particles of non equi molar copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride having con siderably less heterogeneity, finer cell structure, greater ex pandability, less heat sensitivity, less shrinkage, and lower density potential on molding.
