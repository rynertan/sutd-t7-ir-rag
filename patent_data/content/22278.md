# Method and apparatus for longitudinally stretching a substantially amorphous polyethylene terephthalate film.

## Abstract
The tensioning operation is stricktly separated from the heating and the cooling operations of the film, by the symmetric heating 16, 17, 20, 21 and cooling 22 , and the heating of the film is carried out in two stages, namely a preheating by means of diffused IR radiation 16, 17 , and a line heating by means of bundled IR radiation 20, 21 . The invention is particularly applicable in the field of photograph, where film supports are required that must meet high standards of flatness and surface quality, and where losses of the expensive base material should be kept to a minimum.
