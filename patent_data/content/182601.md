# Multi direction time division multiplex communication apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus 36 is for a central station in a multi direc tion time division multiplex communication system in which the central station transmits signals assigned to respective satellite stations in a time division multiplex broadcast mode, while each of the satellite stations after extraction of a clock extracts the signal assigned thereto and intermittently trans mits signals to the central station after adjusting the signals to such a timing that, when the signals reach the central station, the signals from the various satellite stations do not overlap and appear in order as a single sequence of time division multiplex signals. The received signals demodulated by a demodulator 30 are applied to a plurality of code regenerations 32‚ÇÅ 32
