# Constant voltage power source device.

## Abstract
A constant voltage power source device for a highly accurate electric circuit, connected to an A.C. power source, capable of minimizing size of the current loop, making the ground line current constant even when the load current var ies, and having a high noise elimination ratio as well as a low output impedance. The device comprises a constant current circuit 28 connected in series with the load 26 , and in parallel there with a constant voltage circuit 30 including a control amp lifier 44 which controls the current I The device is particularly suitable for an audio video recording reproducing apparatus or a measuring instru ment, and can be used instead of a battery power source which, until now, has been considered to be ideal for such purposes.
