## Description
PRODUCTS EXHIBITING REDUCED WATER ACTIVITY CONTAINING DERIVED PROTEIN CONTAINING CONSOSITIONS AND FOODS COMPRISING SAID PRODUCTS AS HUMECTANTSBACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION This invention relates to products exhibiting reduced water activity containing derived proteincontaining compositions and particularly byproducts obtained from concentrating whey protein by means of ultrafiltration or gel filtration and the dried products obtained thereby. It is well known that foods can be preserved by drying. It is also known that some foods having a moisture level between fresh and dried are stable and do not contain sufficient moisture to support bacteriological growth, i.e., cheese. Because of the recognition of this factor, a class of foods called intermediate moisture foods has arisen.One of the more important commercial examples of this class is semi moist pet foods. In order to determine if the semi moist food will be stable, it is necessary to determine the water activity, aw, of the product. Water activity is defined as the ratio of the materialsl water vapor pressure to the vapor pressure of pure water at saturation in air at the temperature of the material. This can be represented mathematically by the formula EMI1.1 wherein the water activity is aw, P is the vapor S pressure of water vapor in the food, PO is the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature, Nw is moles of water and N5 is moles of solute CommercialDevelopment of Intermediate Moisture and Food, M. Kaplow, Food Technology, Volume 28, page 889,August 1970 . One method of determining water activity involves humidifying samples in desiccators at 370C. to the desired water activity by using saturated salt solutions. The procedure involves placing the sample uncovered in the desiccator and leaving the sample in the desiccator to equilibrate. Moisture isotherms are prepared by determining gravimetrically the weight increase of the samples. Illustrative reference saturated salt solutions are as follows TABLE IEMI2.1 tb SEP Salt SEP aw SEP at SEP 250C. SEP aw SEP at 300C.

Fresh foods generally have more than 60 moisture and an a of greater than 0.90. Dry foods w have a moisture content of less than 15 and an aw of less than 0.20. Three problems are connected with the stability of intermediate moisture foods, i.e., microorganisms, browning and lipid oxidation. Depressing the water activity has an inhibiting effect on the growth of microorganisms and, apparently, an antioxidant effect on lipid oxidation. Stille 1948 has suggested an aw of 0.75 as an overall limit for most foods stored in cool environments. Mossel and Ingram 1955 have suggested an aw of 0.70 for long term storage in tropical climates. Mossel and Sand 1968 suggest inhibition of all microorganisms occurs only below aw of 0.60. It is noted that these are guidelines.Moisture isotherms shift with temperatures such that storage at a higher temperature with the same moisture content gives a higher aw than storage of the same product at lower temperature. Water activity below which microorganism growth is inhibited is illustrated by the following though these amounts can vary TABLE IIOrganism Water Activity a, Eacteria 0.91Yeasts 0.88Molds 0.80 NASA CONTRACTOR REPORT, NASA CR 114,861, June 1972, Table 1, page 77 . Because the stability is dependent on available moisture and not total moisture, much research has been done in the area of humectants. In descending order of effectiveness as humectants are sodium chloride, potassium chloride, propylene glycol, glycerol, 1 3 butylene glycol, sorbitol, fructose, polyethylene glycol 400, glucose, sucrose, 42 D.E.corn syrup solids and lactose. It has also been suggested that dried whey, delactosed whey and whey protein concentrate may find utility as humectants.While sodium and potassium chloride are 2 2.5 times more effective than propylene glycol, they have not been used for humectants due to flavor problems.While propylene glycol and glycerol are highly effective as humectants, they are detectable by pets who dislike the taste. Compositions with effective water activity and good taste are needed to overcome the problems incurred in using prior art materials. It is also known that, because of the increasing requirement for protein sources throughout the world, various processes have been recently developed to extract protein from whey. Particular reference is made to the Dienst Attebery patent, Reissue PatentNo. 27,806, which discloses a method of separating protein from cheese whey by means of molecular sieve resin, more commonly known as gel filtration. Also in active use is the technique of ultrafiltration to separate and concentrate the protein from the whey. The development of the separation techniques has also raised further processing problems. The byproducts from these processes are not easily adaptable to prevent known techniques of material handling. In the processing of cheese whey by molecular sieve resin, a low molecular weight fraction about 5 10 solids is obtained which has a solids composition of mainly lactose and minerals with residual protein. The solids in this low molecular weight fraction can be described more particularly by the following typical chemical analysis. Lactose, 40 50 Minerals, 25 35 Protein N x 6.38 , 15 20 Lactic Acid, 7 10 Citric Acid, 3 6 Fat, less than 1 Moisture less than 5 pH 6.6 7.2Similarly, the use of ultrafiltration provides a permeate which is high in minerals and lactose. The solids in the permeate can be described more particularly by the following typical chemical analysis. Lactose, 70 80 Minerals, 10 15 Protein, N x 6.38 , 4 8 Fat, less than 1 Moisture less than 5 pH 6 7 After removing the lactose by normal lactose crystallization procedures, the now delactosed permeate contains from about 40 to about 45 lactose, from about 25 to about 35 ash and from about 8 to about 12 protein TKN x 6.38 . However, the totalKjeldahl nitrogen TKN is a raeasure of all the nitrogen in the system protein as well as non protein nitrogen , and this is an approximation of the total protein present.While the delactosed permeate is indicated to have 8 12 protein T4 x 6.38 , more than 60 of this protein is based on non protein nitrogen, i.e., derived protein and amino acids.Derived protein is defined as a decomposition product of proteins that is intermediate in complexity of structure between proteins and gamine acids Hackh sChemical Dictionary, 3rd Edition . Two primary problems have been associated with the low molecular weight fraction and the permeate.First of all, conventional drying techniques cannot be utilized due to undesirable particle adherence to the walls. The second problem associated with these products is the undesirably high level of hygroscopicity exhibited by these products. The products,. particularly delactosed permeate, rapidly pick up moisture from the air. Also, the undesirable level of hygroscopicity tends to detract from the potential use of this product in food applications.Once the package is opened, the dried particles immediately absorb moisture and cake. It is also known to utilize the permeate and delactosed permeate in the formation of an egg albumen extender. In assignee s copending applicationSerial No. 970,688, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, there are disclosed egg albumen extenders comprising at least 65 b weight on a dry solids basis of a derived protein containing composition from plant or animal sources wherein said derived protein containing composition has a molecular weight of less than 20,000, a totalKjeldahl nitrogen content of from about 0.45 to about 2.1 of which at least 60 of the nitrogen is non protein nitrogen, and from 0 to about 30 of a whipping aid, in combination with a member selected from the group consisting of gelatin, gelatin and a water soluble polyphosphate, a gum, and mixtures thereof.It has been found that these products are also difficult to dry when prepared from the liquid byproduct solution. Dry blending cannot be accomp lished due to the difficulties in drying the byproduct solution before blending. An improved process for drying a mineral containing aqueous protein solution is disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,840,996. In this patent, the low molecular weight byproduct fraction from the gel filtration of the whey is admixed with inorganic drying agents selected from the group consisting of tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, silica gel, calcium silicate hydrate, or mixtures thereof and spray dried. This product is useful in flavor enhancing various foods. In assignee s copending application Serial No.6,817, it is disclosed that mineral containing deproteinized whey byproduct solutions can be more effectively dried by mixing from about 5 to about 50 casein or alkali metal caseinates with the solution and codrying the solution. However, the high cost of casein and caseinates make this process economically unattractive. It has now been found that products exhibiting reduced water activity and good flavor can be obtained using derived protein containing compositions and particularly deproteinized mineral containing whey byproducts of whey protein concentration.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention it has been found that a first composition comprising a derived protein containing composition to be defined hereinafter can be used to provide a product exhibiting reduced water activity. Preferably that first composition is codried with from about 20 to about 75 by weight starch.The first composition is defined as comprising at least 65 of a derived protein containing composition from plant or animal sources wherein the molecular weight of said derived protein containing composition is less than 30,000, said composition having a totalKjeldahl nitrogen content of from about 0.45 to about 2.1 of which at least 60 of the nitrogen is nonprotein nitrogen, from about 0 and preferably to 35 of a member selected from the group consisting of from about 1 to about 15 gelatin from about 1 to about 15 gelatin and from about 5 to about 25 of a water soluble polyphosphate, the additive total of gelatin and phosphate not to exceed about 35 from about Q.5 to about 5 of a gum and mixtures thereof and from about 0 to about 30 of a whipping aid, all percentages being by weight based on the total dry solids weight of the aforecited ingredients in said first composition the products of the invention include the codried blend of said first composition and starch as well as food products of reduced water activity containing the first composition. Preferably the first composition is in the food as part of the codried blend. The products of the invention are characterized as providing a water activity within the range of from about 0.5 to about 0.8 and preferably 0.55 to 0.75 at 30 moisture at 370C. The products containing the derived protein containing composition codried with starch can be dried, handled and incorporated into dry or liquid food systems. These codried products of the invention as well as the first composition are effective food humectants as well as flavor enhancers and can also be used as egg albumen extenders in soft meringues. The products of the invention are bland to slightly salty and thus contribute no flavor problems when used in foods even in large amounts. The amounts of starch are based on the dry solids in the final dried product. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention is based on certain derived protein containing compositions. The molecular weight for substantially all matter in the derived proteincontaining composition is less than 30,000 and preferably less than 20,000. A material which has been ultrafiltered through a membrane having a molecular cut off of 20,000 is considered less than 20,000. As used herein, the term derived protein containing composition is intended to include all protein decomposition products including peptides and amino acids. The nitrogen in the derived protein containing composition is determined by the Kjeldahl method which determines nitrogen from all sources and cannot differentiate between protein nitrogen and non protein nitrogen. In the present invention, the total Kjeldahl nitrogen content in the derived protein containing composition preferably ranges from about .45 to about 2.1 and more preferably from about 1.1 to about 2.1 providing a total Kjeldahl protein content of from about 3 to about 13 and from about 7 to about 13 respectively.Of the total Keldahl nitrogen at least about 60 is non protein nitrogen. Non protein nitrogen is determined by adding trichloroacetic acid to a protein solution in an amount sufficient to provide about a 15 solution of trichloroacetic acid.Protein is precipitated and removed by centrifugation.The nitrogen content of the supernatant is determined by the Kjeldahl nitrogen method. The percent total non protein nitrogen is determined by dividing the trichloroacetic acid soluble Kjeldahl nitrogen by the total Xjeldahl nitrogen content of the original solution on a dry solids basis. The nonprotein nitrogen can range as high as 2.1 ali non protein nitrogen and preferably from about 0.66 to about 1.68 . The percentage of Kjeldahl nitrogen and nonprotein nitrogen is based on the dry weight of the derived protein containing composition. Further discussion can be found in Serial No. 970,688, ibid. The derived protein containing composition can be prepared from legumes, oil bearing seeds, milk or milk derived products. The derived proteincontaining compositions are usually byproducts of a previous procedure used to extract an ingredient from the main source. The legumes include any members of the pea family such as peas, soy beans and peanuts and preferably soy beans. The oil bearing material seeds include those materials from which oil is extracted such as cottonseed, safflowers, corn. and the like. The derived protein containing compositions used in the present invention are prepared, for instance, by precipitating protein from an aqueous solution in a manner similar to cheese or soy protein isolate production. When preparing soy protein isolate, soy protein is extracted from defatted soy flour and is separated from the solution by acidifying to pH of approximately 4.6. The precipitated product is called soy protein isolate and the supernatant is termed soy whey. In the countries of the Far East, a similar product is prepared by precipitating a curd or tofu from soy milk leaving a similar soy whey. These soy wheys can be further processed to remove the higher molecular weight protein and provide a product usable in the present invention. Other such byproducts can be prepared from other legume or oil bearing seeds. The derived protein containing composition is preferably obtained from a dairy source, i.e., milk and milk derived products. The derived proteincontaining composition prepared from a dairy source is generally the byproduct of a physical or chemical separation or fractionation of the various components in the milk or milk derived product. Such physical or chemical processes include gel permeation filtration, ultrafiltration, dialysis, electrodialysis, as well as protein precipitation processes such as cheese production, either enzyme or acid, chemical precipitation including acid addition for casein precipitation, polyphosphate, sodium lauryl sulfate or other such chemical protein precipita tions. Preferably, the derived protein containing composition is prepared from soy or dairy whey and more preferably dairy whey which has been processed to further reduce the protein constituent therein.For instance, whey can be filtered through an ultrafiltration membrane to provide a protein rich retentate and a deproteinized mineral containing lactose rich permeate. The dried products of the present invention are preferably based on certain deroteinized whey byproduct solutions. As used herein, the term whey byproducts is intended to encompass the low molecular weight second fraction obtained from the molecular sieve fractionation of whey as described inU.S. Reissue Patent No. 27,806, the permeate obtained from the ultrafiltration concentration of protein from whey, and delactosed permeate. The low molecular weight second fraction is the material obtained by passing a partially delactosed cheese whey mother liquor through a bed of molecular sieve resin in accordance with Reissue Patent No.27,806 and recovering, for the purposes of this invention,the low molecular weight second fraction containing mainly lactose, minerals and residual protein. The molecular weight cut off of the gel is preferably 30,000. The partially delactosed whey mother liquor is obtained by concentrating raw cheese whey by conventional means to a solids concentration of about 60 , reducing the temperature of the concentrate to induce lactose crystallization and thereafter separating crystalline lactose from the liquid by conventional means. If desired, the whey can be pretreated to clarify the whey using processes such as illustrated by that disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,560,219. In accordance with this patent, lipid is removed as a precipitate from whey by treating the whey solution with a calcium ion at approximately a neutral pH. Preferably, the whey stream used in the gel filtration fractionation of whey is clarified prior to delactosing. The preferred method of clarification is the process described in U.S. Patent No. 3,560,219 for sweet whey. For acid whey, the preferred clarification method is that shown in U.S. PatentNo. 4,036,999, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Also effective in the present invention is the permeate obtained from the ultrafiltration of cheese whey solutions. Ultrafiltration membranes are utilized to separate the high molecular weight protein and non protein nitrogen compounds below about 20,000 molecular weight and ash in the whey solution. The protein enriched solution is retained on the membrane and it is called the retentate. The water and low molecular weight fraction passes through the membrane and is called the permeate. An illustrative method for ultrafiltration is described by Horton, B.S. et al.,Food Technology, Vol. 26, page 30, 1972. In an illustrative method for ultrafiltering cheese whey, an acid or cottage cheese whey concentrate containing from about 40 to about 60 and preferably 50 55 whey protein is prepared by neutralizing acid whey to a pH of 6.5 with caustic. After storage, the pH is then adjusted to 7.2 and any solids or precipitates are removed by centrifugal clarification. The clarified liquor is then pasteurized and fed into the ultrafiltration membrane unit. The retentate is condensed and spray dried. The liquid permeate is then used in the process of the invention. The permeate can be dried as is or concentrated and or delactosed by concentration and cooling to effect a precipitation of a lactose. The permeate is a deproteinized whey solution and the delactosed permeate is a delactosed deproteinized whey solution. The raw cheese whey source used in preparing the materials used in the invention can bo acid cheese whey, sweet cheese whey,, or mixtures thereof.More particularly, the raw cheese whey can be cottage cheese whey, casein cheese whey, cheddar cheese Wheyr mozarella cheese whey, Swiss cheese whey or mixtures thereof. Preferably, raw cheese whey used in connection with the molecular sieve fractionation is a blend of cottage cheese whey and cheddar cheese whey.The preferred cheese whey for use in the ultrafiltration fractionation of whey is acid cheese whey. The starch, used in the present invention, can be any starch or blends thereof, modified or unmodified which is water soluble swellable under the conditions of codrying. The starch is used at a level sufficient to provide a viscosity at a level sufficient to be codried in the particular drying apparatus used. For a solution which is to be codried in an atomizing dryer such as a spray dryer, the byproduct starch solution must have a viscosity low enough to allow atomization, i.e., less than 125 cps. The starch used in the forming a solution for spray drying is characterized by a thin, hot viscosity thin boiling and little or no tendency to gel upon cooling. A starch which gels at the drying temperature can be effectively dried in nonatomizing dryers illustrated by drum dryers. The starch can be derived from any starch source such as cereal grains, i.e., corn, waxy corn, wheat, sorghum, rice tubers, or roots of such plants as cassava tapioca , potato or arrowroot and the pith from the sago palm. For the atomization dry method, starcheswith an amylose content of below about 25 are preferred. More preferably the molecular weight of the amylose in the starch is greater than that of the amylose of corn starch The preferred low amylose types of starches can be illustrated by waxy corn starch. Tapioca starch is most preferred since it has both low amylose content and the high molecular weight amylose. The starch can be modified or non modified.Modification includes genetic modification waxy corn or waxy sorghum , starch conversion, crosslinking, derivation, and physical treatment.Starch conversions are the most common method of modifying starch. Conversions are processes which reduce the viscosity of the raw starch when cooked by scission of the molecule at the glucosidic linkage. The conversions are generally run on starch granules for ease of recovery. Conversions on cooked starch are generally used for enzyme conversion, thermal conversion and in the production of syrups and glucose. Whole granules are used in making thin boiling or fluidity starches by acid conversion, oxidized starches, white dextrins,British gums and yellow dextrins. Thin boiling starches are made by controlled acid hydrolysis of starch in the granular state at about 520C. using sulfuric or hydrochloric acid as catalyst. Cold water stability is dependent on the amount of amylose in the starch. Thin boiling starches from corn starch can form rigid gels on cooking but stable and fluid sols from waxy corn. Oxidized starches are prepared by treating an aqueous suspension of starch with sodium hypochlorite. When partial or complete cold water solubility of a starch is desired, dry conversions or dextrinizations are used. Generally, a powdered starch of 5 20 moisture is prepared by treating a starch with an acid or buffer, drying, heating for pyroconversion, cooling and packing. Three stages are involved, hydrolysis, transgluctsidation and repolymerization. Three basic types of products are formed using this method, i.e., white dextrins,British gums and yellow dextrins. The maintenance of a maximum viscosity of starch without a substantial reduction in viscosity over an extended cook time is accomplished by cross linking. Cross linking is generally used with starches used in thickening and stabilizing. The starch granules are treated with di or polyfunctional reagents capable of reacting with the hydroxyl groups in the starch molecule such as mixed anhydride of acetic and citric acid or adipic acid, meta phosphates, phosphorus oxychloride, epichlorohydrin and the like. Only a fewtrosslinks are necessary to toughen the starch granules. Derivation includes reacting the hydroxyl groups of the starch with various chemical agents to change the characteristics of the starch. Physical treatment includes redrying, blending with additives, such as tilcalciura phosphate as a flow control agent, precooking pregelatinized starch , drum drying ground flakes water soluble and spray drying cooked starches. One major converted product area is syrups and sugars. Two types of reactions are used, acid catalyzed hydrolysis or enzyme hydrolysis. The conversions can prepare products having DextroseEquivalents or D.E. Basic measure of conversion ranging from very low to 75 and higher. Pure dextrose has a D.E. of 100. For purposes of the present invention, products with a D.E. of about 30 and preferably about 15 or less are useful. The type of starch utilized depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the starch, the amount used, and the end use of the product.The preferred starch is a low amylose modified tapioca starch which is thin boiling and has little tendency to gel on cooling. The blend of the deproteinized whey byproduct solution and starch can be codried by any known means depending on the starch utilized. Preferably, an atomizing type dryer is utilized. By atomizing dryer is meant any conventional dryer which effects drying of liquid by reducing or atomizing the liquid feed stream containing diss olved or suspended solids to droplet form in the presence of a drying atmosphere. This type of dryer is illustrated by a spray dryer, fluid bed dryer or flash or vacuum dryer. More particularly, the term spray dryer includes vertical spray dryers, horizontal spray dryers and filter mat dryers. The atomizing dryer generally includes a main drying chamber, an atomizer, e.g., a spray nozzle, adapted to feed the material to be dried into a drying atmosphere in the dryer chamber.As used herein, drying atmosphere is also intended to cover a negative pressure atmosphere such as used in a flash or vacuum evaporator. In a conventional spray dryer, the inlet air stream is generally heated to effect drying. The inlet temperature is usually heated within the range of from about 1680C. to about 1820C. The corresponding outlet temperature usually ranges from about 1100C. to about 1160C. The temperature in the dryer is not critical with the exception that the temperature must be high enough to effectively dry the product yet insufficient to cause burning or browning. High product temperature without effective means of dissipating the heat can cause lumping. The parameters of the dryer as well as the conditions generally employed such as feed rate, residence time and the like can be easily discerned by one skilled in the art. If the starch tends to gel at higher temperatures, the drying must be accomplished under low temperature conditions to avoid .gelation of the starch. Air drying, vacuum drying or freeze drying can be used.Other dryers such as drum dryers can also be used depending on the characteristics of the starch utilized. If desired, one can also include a small proportion of a drying agent or a flow control agent selected from the group consisting of tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, silica gel, calcium silicate hydrate and mixtures thereof. The blend of the whey byproduct solution and the starch dries with greater facility and is less hygroscopic than the whey byproduct alone allowing it to be more easily bagged. The starch codried product is substantially non caking which facilitates the use of the product. Flavors, colors, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and the like can also be dissolved in the solution of the whey byproducts and starch and codried herewith. Other proteins up to 25 such as dairy proteins including whey, delactosed whey, whey protein concentrates, whey precipitates prepared by the processes of U.S. Patent Nos. 3,560,219 and 4,036,999 and the like or vegetable proteins such as soy can also be combined with the first composition or codried with the same and the starch though this is not preferred. Also, functional ingredients in amounts from about 1 to about 35 by weight of dry solids of the first composition can be added in forming a final product with specific functionality. For instance, an egg albumen extender and a humectant can be prepared from at least 65 of the whey byproduct composition in combination with a member of the group of from 1 to about 15 gelatin or from about 1 to about 15 gelatin and from about 5 to about 25 of a water soluble polyphosphate such as sodium hexametaphosphate, the additive total of gelatin and polyphosphate not to exceed about 35 or from about 0.5 to about 58 of a gum or mixtures thereof and from about 0 to about 30 of a whipping aid can be added to the solution of whey byproduct prior to drying.The percentages are based on the weight of the solids in the raw whey byproduct solution exclusive of the starch. The gelatin used in the present invention can be either of the alkaline or preferably the acid prepared type. Gelatins ranging in Bloom strength from about 100 to about 300 and preferably from about 200 to about 250 Bloom can be used. The gelatin can be predissolved in water to facilitate incorporation. Preferably, cold water dispersible gelatin is used. The water soluble polyphosphate usable in the present invention are medium chain length sequestering type polyphosphate of the formula EMI21.1 wherein X is hydrogen or alkali metal. Preferably, the average chain length N ave. is from 3 to 20.Representative compositions within this group are sodium or potassium tripolyphosphate, sodium or potassium tetrapolyphosphate, sodium or potassium hexametaphosphate, the more preferred being sodium hexametaphosphate SHY2 with an average chain length of 6 18, and the most preferred .9 12. The gums which can be used in the present invention include any of the edible gums or protective colloids such as carrageenan, alginates including sodium or potassium alginate, cellulose gums including sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxymethyl propylcellulose and preferably, carboxymethylcellulose, accacia, guar, xanthan, and mixtures thereof. The gum is preferably used in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to an amount above which the final product shows adverse properties in the area of use. In general, the gum is not to exceed about 5 by weight based on the weight of the final product exclusive of starch , the upper limit varying depending on the actual gum utilized.In some cases, more can be used and in some cases, less. The preferred gum is carrageenan which is used in amounts ranging from 0.5 up to and including about 3 exclusive of starch . The optional whipping aid is illustrated by enzyme hydrolyzed wheat or soy protein which can be prepared by hydrolyzing any wheat or soy protein or wheat protein mixture such as gluten by any proteolytic enzyme effective for that purpose provided the final product has a bland flavor which will not affect the overall flavor of the egg albumen replacer. Proteolytic enzymes are well known to those skilled in the art and effective proteolytic enzymes can be easily determined by such person. While the enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat or soy protein can be used alone, it is preferably used with a small quantity up to and including about 20 to thicken and stabilize the mixture, the percentage being by weight based on the total weight of the enzyme hydrolyzed wheat protein.An illustration of these materials is HYFOAMA 68 available from Naarden Lenderrink and Co., Belgium and GUNTHERS 400V available from A. E. Staley. The former material has 60 protein, 5 water, 6 ash, and 20 carbohydrate. The enzymatically hydrolyzed wheat protein is used in amounts of from about 58 to about 30t and preferably from about 10 to about 20 by weight, based on the total weight of the whey byproduct containing composition exclusive of starch. The latter material is composed of enzymatically modified soy protein 55 of total , sodium hexametaphosphate, gelatin and sodium aluminum sulfate. The amount of starch used in the codried blend is dependent on the chemical characteristics of the starch.In general, the starch is used in an amount ranging from about 20 , preferably from about 20 to about 75 and more preferably from about 25 to about 50 , said percentages being based on the dry weight of the protein component and optional gelatin, polyphosphate, gum and whipping aid. These amounts are for the preferred low amylose type starches and may vary from starch to starch. For instance, a film forming starch can be used at 50 but not at 25 whereas a tapioca dextrin can be used at 25 . In general, the whey byproduct can be directly blended with the starch and spray dried. The use of slightly elevated temperature assists in the solubilization of the starch. The temperature used in this stage should not cause gelatinization or thickening of the starch prior to spray drying.A temperature within the range of from about 60 C. and 700C. is suggested for tapioca dextrins. The solution to be spray dried should have a viscosity which is adaptable for drying in the drying apparatus selected. For spray drying, the viscosity should be at least 125 cps at the level of solids and starch needed for effective drying. Excessive starch, or excessive solids will cause the viscosity to be too high. It has been found that the total solids content can have an adverse effect on the preparation of a usable product. For the preparation of an effective non caking product the total solids content of the feed to the dryer should be in the range of from about 15 to about 35 and preferably from about 20 to about 30 . These amounts may vary depending on the material being dried and the type of dryer used. Most preferably, for drying compositions of delactosed permeate, gelatin, SHMP starch, a total solids content of about 25 28 is preferred. The adjustment in water content is preferably accomplished by adding the amount of water required to provide the desired final total solids content to the liquid whey byproduct prior to the addition of the remaining ingredients. The ingredients can be blended and the total solids adjusted after blending if desired. The aforediscussed egg albumen extender can also be prepared by drying the solution of whey byproduct and if desired with the starch and then dry blending therewith the gelatin, gelatin and polyphosphate, or gum. The dry product can also be dry blended with various ingredients for color, taste, function, i.e., emulsifiers, stabilizers, texturizers and the like. The first composition of the invention can be used in combination with other protein containing products such as whey, whey protein concentrate, products derived from whey such as that shown in Attebery 3,560,219 use of calcium ion to form a precipitate from whey at neutral pH , Grindstaff 4,036,999 precipitate formed by neutralizing acid whey , delactosed whey, demineralized whey, NFDM, soy protein and the like.The protein can be codried with or dry blended with the product of the invention. Amounts ranging from 0 to about 25 by weight on dry solids basis can be used. It has been found that the dried whey byproduct preferably blended with starch with or without the gelatin, SHMP, or gum when incorporated in a food product can perform the function of a humectant. Thus, the whey byproduct of the invention can be used in areas where humectants such as propylene glycol are presently in use. The products of the invention can be used as the sole humectant or in combination with other known humectants such as propylene glycol or glycerine.Effective humectant activity can be established using a sufficient amount of the humectant to provide from about 2 to about 20 by weight derived protein in said food on a dry solids basis. The starch containing blends of the present invention can also be used in food products as flavor enhancing agents, flavor agents or binding agents. More specifically, the blend derived from the present invention can be used in meat products, for example, soups, stews, gravies, breadings, batters, beef patties and imitation sausages. Also, the product can be used in chip dips, cheese products such as cheese spreads, process cheese foods, spray dried cheeses, and imitations thereof and the like. The blends can also be used in non food areas such as cosmetics. Since the starch is a significant part of the product1 its selection is relevant to any specific use. Of particular importance is the use of the first composition and particularly the codried blend with starch of the present invention as humectants in intermediate moisture foods such as semi dry pet foods, such as that illustrated by U.S. patents 3,202,514, 3,852,483 and 4,018,909, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The first composition or product containing the same can be used as the sole humectant or in combination with other known humectants such as propylene glycol and glycerine and can be incorporated in place of existing humectants in standard recipes.The first composition or products containing the same, particularly the preferred codried starch blend can be used in such amounts as to provide a water activity for the food of between about 0 6 and less than about 0.9 and preferably from about 0.75 to about 0.85 when measured at 30 moisture at 370C. The actual amount used will vary depending on the ingredients present in the food such as sugars which are particularly known to have a reducing influence on water activity. The present invention is further illustrated in the examples which follow. The tapioca dextrin as used in the examples has a Dextrose Equivalent of less than 30. EXAMPLE 1 47.3 liters of liquid delactosed permeate DLP obtained from the ultrafiltration of acid whey having a total solids content ranging from about 31 to about 34 is blended with 15 milliliters of catalase solution to destroy any residual of the peroxide added to the DLP for preservation. A blend of 9.80 kilograms of starch a tapioca dextrin,K 4484 from National Starch and Chemical Corp. in 41.6 liters of water is added to the DLP. The temperature of the mixture is brought up to 65.60C. and the product spray dried. The product has a ratio of DLP Starch of about 2 1 and spray dries very well with little build up on the dryer walls. No caking is visible after four days storage. About 30.6 kilograms of product is obtained. This product has a water activity of between about 0.6 and 0.7 at 30 moisture at 370C. EXAMPLE 2 37.85 liters of DLP 31 34 TS is blended with 15 milliliters of catalase to destroy any peroxide preservative. 54.25 liters of water is then added to the DLP and the mixture is heated to 65.6 C. A dry blend mixture of 9.08 kilograms starch tapioca dextrin, D 4484, National Starch and Chemical Corp. , 3.405 kilograms sodium hexametaphosphate SHMP and 0.68 kilograms gelatin. The dry blend is added to the DLP and water spray dried. The product spray dries well with almost no build up on the drier walls. 27.9 kilograms of a dense slightly hygroscopic powder is obtained. The ratio of DLP SHMP Gelatin to starch is about 2 1. This product has an approximate water activity of about 0.65 at 30 moisture at 370C. EXAMPLE 3 123 liters of DLP 31 to 34 TS is blended with 22.7 kilograms starch tapioca dextrin D 4484National Starch and Chemical Corp. and 102.2 liters of water. The blend is heated to 65..60C. and spray dried. 67.6 kilograms of a slightly hygroscopic fine powder is obtained with a ratio ofDLP to starch of about 2 1 and an aw of about 0.6 to 0.7 at 30 moisture at 370C. EXAMPLE 4 Four samples of DLP starch blends at ratios of 1.5 1, 2 1, 2.5 1 and 4 1 are prepared by blendingDLP and starch tapioca dextrin, K 4484 NationalStarch and Chemical Corp. in a 19 liter container with agitation.

EXAMPLE 8 A soft meringue having a pH equivalent to a commercial meringue pH 8.2 is prepared by combining 4.6 grams of the product of the invention, 35.4 grams water and 120 grams of liquid egg albumen and then dissolving 0.3 grams of cream of tartar therein. This mixture is whipped at speed No. 3 for two minutes in a 3 quart HobartTMMixer. While whipping is continued for another five minutes at speed No. 3, 204 grams of granulated sugar is added at a rate of about 7 grams per 5 seconds. After the specific gravity of the foam is determined, 40 grams of foam is weighed into a 200 milliliter funnel fitted with a wire screen.The drainage in milliliters of liquid is determined after standing for 24 hours at 4.4 7.20C. 40 grams of foam is weighed in duplicate and baked inside a 2040C. oven for 7 minutes. The specific volume of the meringue is determined after drying 24 hours at 400C.

No appreciable difference is noted between theDLP Starch and DLP Gelatin SHMP Starch blends. The blends consisting of lower ratios of starch function slightly better but are noted to exhibit more hygroscopicity. On an equal starch ratio, the blends containing the gelatin and SKMP are noted to exhibit less hygroscopicity. EXAMPLE 9 The water absorption isotherms of the products of the invention are determined. At the moisture levels for intermediate moisture pet food, e.g., 20 40 moisture, the estimated water activity is above 0.55 but below 0.75. Change in either ratio of DLP or DLP Gelatin SHMP to starch or the type of starch affects the water activity only slightly.
