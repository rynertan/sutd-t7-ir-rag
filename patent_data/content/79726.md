# Apparatus for determining an electrical characteristic of a fibrous dispersion.

## Abstract
In the formation of a paper web from stock fed to a Foudrinier wire, the Zeta Potential is an important parameter. A measure of Zeta potential Z is made by measuring the streaming potential E developed in a vertically arranged cell 12 having a horizontal mesh 14 therein on the underside of which a pad of fibres and fines is formed by pumping 32 stock 30 into the lower part of the cell 12 . Electrodes 40, 42 located in the cell above and below the mesh 14 are used to obtain a measure of streaming potential E at a given pressure differential P across the pad. A pressure transducer 44 is mounted in the lower part 64 of the cell 12 . Corrections are made for temperature and conductivity by sensors 46, 50 in the stock feed path to the cell 12 . A microprocessor control and measuring circuit 140 is disclosed which sequences valves 22, 24, 26, 28, 38 for controlling the flow of stock and flushing fluid 20 to the cell 12 and which measures the relevant parameters.
