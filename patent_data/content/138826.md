## Description
This invention relates generally to enzyme immunoassay EIA techniques, and to the determination of human chorionic gonadotropin HCG in particular. Enzyme immunoassay EIA methods have been described, Guesdon J., Ternynck, T., Avrameas, S., The Use of Avidin Biotin Interaction in Immunoenzymatic Techniques, The measurement of HCG in serum or urine is of interest in the diagnosis of early pregnancy, detection of ectopic pregnancies, and in monitoring various tumors. Walsh, P.R., Wang M., Gittermann, M.L., CLINICAL IMMUNOCHEMISTRY, American Association for Clinical Chemistry, 1978, Natelson, S. et al, Eds., pp. 306 328. The document US A 4 298 685 discloses a method of determining the amount of an antigen or other biological substance in a sample, in which the sample is mixed with antibodies raised against the substance to be determined, and with a known amount of that substance labelled with an enzyme. The antibodies are tagged with biotin. After competitive complexation of the antibody with the labelled substance and the substance to be detected, avidin immobilised on an inert support is added. The solid and liquid phases are then separated, and the amount of the biological substance in the original sample is then determined by measuring the activity of the enzyme in eithr phase. The use of filter papers, usually in the form of small discs, in various assay procedures is well known. However, efforts to develop an assay method for HCG using filter paper discs has not been successful. After considerable work, it was discovered that the methods based upon binding HCG antibody to a disc and reacting the disc with a solution suspected of containing HCG, e.g. urine, were of poor reliability and sensitivity. Moreover, discs and filter paper devices cannot be manufactured by known techniques in a satisfactory manner. The present invention overcomes these disadvantages and makes possible a rapid, reliable and simple enzyme immunoassay for HCG in urine, or other solution. A method has been developed for determining chorionic gonadotropin HCG which is highly sensitive, extremely simple to carry out, and can be adapted to home use kits. The invention comprises the method and a kit or system for carrying out this detection. The concept of this invention has broader application to specific antigen determinations, and can also be adapted for determination of antibodies using the same concept by simply reversing the role of the antigen and antibody. According to the invention in a first aspect, a method for detecting the presence or absence of an analyte in a test solution suspected of containing said analyte having the steps of According to the invention in a second aspect, a method of determining analyte in a sample which comprises reacting a solution suspected of containing analyte with a solid phase support containing on at least a portion thereof a biotinylated anti analyte antibody or antigen anchored to said support through avidin coated on said support and with an indicator reagent capable of binding analyte and measuring by means of the indicator moiety of the indicator reagent the presence or absence of analyte. According to the invention in a further aspect, a kit for use in detecting desired analyte is characterised by Thus, the method of this invention, exemplified by the determination of human chorionic gonadotropin HCG comprises, in a preferred form Coating all or part of a solid phase support with avidin, by chemical bonding, physical absorption or any other suitable technique, attaching biotinylated anti HCG antibody to the support through the avidin biotin coupling, exposing the support thus prepared to a sample, e.g., a solution, suspected of containing HCG and to labelled anti HCG antibody. The result is a solid phase support having bound thereon HCG and a detectable label which is present in proportion to the amount of HCG substrate or developer for the label, or counted if the label is radioactive, as a measure of the concentration of HCG in the sample. Alternatively, the labelled species may be removed from the support and detected in any conventional manner. Enzyme labelling, e.g., with β galactosidase, is a preferred approach, but other enzymes and radiolabels may be used. The invention can also be utilized in the technique for determining the presence or absence, and measuring the quantity of antibodies. In this instance, an antigen to the specific antibody is biotinylated and bound through avidin to a support, a like antigen is labelled and the reaction is carried out in the same manner, except that the antibody is the species to be determined. Figure 1 depicts a solid phase support, which is coated in whole or in part with avidin, and upon which biotinylated antibody is coated in selected areas, depicting some exemplary patterns which may be formed by printing or otherwise applying the biotinylated antibody in predetermined areas. The solid phase supports in the assay are, in this example, paper discs approximately .7 cm in diameter, Whatman Trademark grade 541. The paper discs are first activated with CNBr according to the procedure described by R. Axen et al. Biotinylation of affinity purified rabbit anti HCG antibody was accomplished by incubation of the antibody with N hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin in borate buffered saline BBS at pH 8.3 at room temperature for 2 hours. Excess N hydroxysuccinimidyl biotin was then removed by dialysis or gel filtration. β Galactosidase linked antibody was prepared by reacting affinity purified mouse anti HCG monoclonal antibody with β galactosidase through a cross linking reagent M Maleimidobenzol N Hydroxysuccinimide MBS according to procedure published by F.T. Liu et al., The immunoassay is accomplished by the interactions of the assay components as described below In a typical Disc Avidin Biotin Ab HCG Ab β Galactosidase A dose response curve has been demonstrated using the above protocol. For qualitative assays, urine sample with 400 mIU ml HCG can be easily detected with the naked eye. This HCG level corresponds to approximately 3 days after missed period. One feature of the invention is the application of the method and protocol to a kit which can be used by an untrained individual in the privacy of her own home to detect the presence or absence of HCG as an indicator of possible pregnancy. As the above protocol indicates, this detection can be made as early as three days after a menstrual period has been missed. A missed period may indicate pregnancy, and it may also indicate a possible complication, in some individuals an early indication of pregnancy is important. There has been a long standing need for a kit which can be used without need for a laboratory or skilled technicians. Kits may also be used in or out of the clinic or laboratory to monitor various tumors. Kits include all reagents necessary to complete a qualitative or semi quantitative determination of HCG in urine. The basic constituents of a kit are 1 Solid phase support, typically filter paper discs, treated with avidin, the avidin being bound to the paper to provide sites which are reactor with biotinylated anti HCG antibody 2 Labeled anti HCG antibody 4 Wash reagents and 5 Developing reagent. In the case given as a preferred embodiment, which is exemplary and non limiting, the developing reagent is O nitrophenyl galactopyranoside ONPG . Development of a β galactoside labeled HCG antibody species provide a color change which is visible to the naked eye. Other color, or visible effect producing label and developer combinations may be applied however, the system described is presently preferred. Buffers, saline reagents, etc. may also be included but it is preferable to incorporate these into the various reagents described above. Kits, according to this invention, would typically include a vessel having a predetermined volume indication, instructions for use, and such accessories as may be convenient for the user. Figure 1 depicts an example of an article of manufacture, such as component of a kit, which embodies a principle of this invention. The device depicted in Figure 1 comprises the solid phase support, a layer of avidin, and a layer of biotinylated antibody or antigen if an antibody is to be detected . Of course, these many layers need not be perfectly congruent with one on the other and, if the substrate were porous, would not be physically discrete layers but in effect would have the described structure. The substrate may be porous or non porous. For example, filter paper and polystyrene may both serve very well. Any solid phase material which is inert in the reactions, and to which avidin can be bound, either by chemical reaction or physical attachment, may be used. Filter paper discs or sheets are a common solid phase support material as are discs or plates of polystyrene. The next component is biotinylated antibody or antigen which is not coated over the entire surface, as was the case in the earlier described examples. Rather the biotinylated antibody or antigen is printed on only selected areas of the avidin coated surface in any desired pattern. The term printed is used to describe the best known technique for manufacturing the multiple indicator substrate of this invention, and the ability to print the antibody on selected areas is a very important feature of this invention. It has been extremely difficult to provide any reliable pattern on filter papers or other substrates because the reagent migrates through or across the substrate. The present invention obviates this entire problem. The biotinylated antibody couples immediately with the avidin, thereby fixing the area on the avidin coated support where a particular antibody will be found. This coupling prevents migration during or after printing, and during reaction, of the antibody or antigen . Thus, upon development of the multiple indicator substrate, the antibody, and any antigen to which it is bound, will be found exactly where it was printed. Printing may be accomplished in the same manner that ink is printed on paper, i.e., by application on type or other patterned means coated with the biotinylated antibody to the avidin coated support. This permits very efficient, high volume production of multiple indicator support, which may have several different antibodies found thereon. The substrate may include indicia formed of ink or other material as well as the indicia formed of antibody or antigen . In Figure 1, for example, the top and center rows indicate, respectively, square or round areas having some other indicia therein upon which the biotinylated antibody is printed, while the lower row indicates biotinylated antibody printed in the form of letters. Obviously, any symbol, shape or alphanumeric indicia may be used. These multiple indicator substrates may be used in the clinical or research laboratory, or may be included in a kit for consumer use. Several different antibodies or antigens , and antibodies of different activity may be printed on the substrate, thus permitting, with one such multiple indicator substrate, several diagnostic tests to be performed at one time, or give semi quantitative results respecting a particular antigen or antibody. Efforts to provide a procedure and a kit in which the HCG was bound to a solid, fibrous substrate, such as filter paper which is available in high purity and convenient sizes were not successful. Two problems plagued the method to the point that the approach was being considered unfeasible. First, low sensitivity was a serious concern. Secondly, and even more serious, was the poor reproducibility. After considerable effort, and consideration of the problem, the inventors determined that the problems were somehow involved in the binding of the reagents to the filter paper. It is not known for certain what the problem is, fundamentally, and no problem was considered likely since it is relatively easy to bind antigen to filter paper, or equivalent porous members. It is postulated, only as a possible explanation, which has not been proven by firm data, that some type of steric hindrance occurs when antibody is bound to the paper which prevents complete, quantitative and reproducible reaction of the treated filter paper by the antibody. In any event, regardless of the actual molecular phenomenon which occurred, poor sensitivity, and a narrow assay range was the result. This immunoassay range did not seem profitable to pursue. In addition, the requirements for individual coupling, handling and storage of solid phase antibodies for different immunoassays was considered prohibitively time consuming and costly. After consideration of the problem, and various evaluations of alternative approaches, and upon experimentation, the technique set forth above was developed by the inventors, and was proved out as a viable, simple, reliable and reproducible method of high sensitivity which finds direct application to the determination of HCG in urine, and has greater applicability for other antibody antigen type reactions. As pointed out above, the same procedure, reversed to bind the antigen to the paper through biotin avidin coupling, rather than the antibody binding described above, may be used to detect the presence of an antibody. Thus, the terms antigen and antibody may be substantially reversed in the specification and claims to give the fully equivalent, converse of the specific terms used above and hereinafter. The general applicability of the present invention has been established. For example, an avidin coated substrate was coated with biotinylated AntiDNP IgG. This avidin biotinylated AntiDNP IgG coated substrate was then reacted with DNP₄₉ BSA and finally with Anti DNP β galactosidase. The presence of DNP₄₉ BSA was determined in the final reaction by production of color on the coated area of the substrate. The results can be quantitatively determined by reading the absorbance of the color at 420 nm in the conventional manner. In another example, the avidin coated portion of a substrate was coated with biotinylated ragweed allergen, then incubated simultaneously with human serum containing Anti Ragweed allergen IgE and with goat Anti Human IgE β galactosidase. The presence of Anti Ragweed IgE is determined by the color produced in the area coated as described, and can be measured photometrically as described above.
