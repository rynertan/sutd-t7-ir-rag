# Static type semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A static type semiconductor memory device having a power down mode in which an operating voltage for peripheral circuits such as decoder circuits is turned off when the memory chip is in a non selected condition. The static type semiconductor memory device comprises first transis tors which are connected to a pair of data buses and which pull down the potentials of the pair of data buses to a medium potential when the memory chip has changed from a selected condition to the non selected condition and second transistors which are connected to the pair of data buses and which pull up the potentials of the pair of data buses to a high potential when the memory chip has changed from a non selected condition to a selected condi tion.
