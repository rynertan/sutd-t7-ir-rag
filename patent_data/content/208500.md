# Electrical contact.

## Abstract
An electrical press fit contact includes a compliant sec tion 3 of substantially C shaped cross section and compris ing first and second arm portions 4 5 with a base portion 8 therebetween. The thickness of the compliant section in creases steadily from the base portion 8 to the arm portions 4 5 such that the centre of the base portion is of least thick ness to form a hinge about which the first and second arm portions may be preferentially deflected. The contact is formed by coining a portion of stock etc such that it has a planar first surface and an arcuate second surface sloping away from the first surface towards its edges. The coined por tion is then folded to form the C shaped compliant section with the first surface being the outer surface and the second surface the inner surface thereof.
