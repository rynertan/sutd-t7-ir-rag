# Preparation of mixed vanadium phosphorus oxide catalysts and their use in oxidative processes.

## Abstract
Vanadium phosphorus mixed oxide containing catalysts are prepared by sequentially forming an alpha VOPOâ‚„ catalyst precursor in aqueous media, and thereafter partially reducing a portion of the vanadium to a valence state of 4 in an organic liquid reducing media, in the absence of corrosive reducing agents. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity for the production of maleic anhydride from 4 carbon atom hydrocarbons such as n butane.
