# ELECTRONIC FUEL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A FUEL INJECTION PUMP

## Abstract
An electronic fuel control system for a fuel injection pump employs a means to determine the quantity of fuel in a charge by sensing the commencement and termination of a fuel injection stroke and sensing the speed of the associated engine. An electronic processor means provides a signal indicative of an adjustment to be effected in a metering means for controlling the flow of fuel to a pumping chamber.
