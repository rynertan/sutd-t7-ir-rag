## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the polymerization of ethylene, other a olefins and dienes using new catalysts and, more specifically, a process for preparing polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene and copolymers of ethylene with propylene or butene at a temperature between 20 C and 150 C using a heterogeneous supported catalyst based on magnesium hydride, titanium tetrachloride and aluminium trialkyl. Since 1953 it has been known that transition metal compounds in combination with main group metal alkyls, the so called Ziegler catalysts, are capable of polymerizing ethylene at a low pressure and at a temperature below 100 C. A significant increase of the polymerization activity could be achieved due to the introduction of the so called supported Ziegler catalysts. In this method the transition metal compound prior to the polymerization is pre reacted with a main group metal compound such as, e.g., silicon dioxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride or magnesium alkyls whereby the transition metal is fixed onto the surface of the support. By the addition of an organic electron donor compound such as, e.g., benzoic acid ethyl ester it is possible to effect stereospecific polymerizations of α olefins. One possibility of increasing the polymerization activity is grinding the catalyst or individual components thereof to increase the specific surface area of the catalyst. EP A 0 090 926 describes a magnesium hydride reagent soluble in certain organic compounds. The mixture comprises magnesium metal and at least an equimolar amount of magnesium halide with a mixture that contains a transition metal halide, a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, an organometallic, organometallic halide, metal hydride or a combination of these. US A 3 478 008 relates to a polymerization catalyst composition which is useful for polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The catalyst composition is a mixture of a trialkylaluminum and the reaction product of a mixture of a metal hydride having only metal and hydrogen atoms, an alkyl aluminum halide activator and titanium tetrachloride. This mixture has been heated at temperatures of up to 250 C. In the present invention there is proposed a process using a catalyst which is obtainable from readily available commercial starting materials, can be prepared easily and quickly and, moreover, owns the substantial advantage of that the basic component magnesium hydride In 1979 Bogdanovic DE OS 28 04 445 1979 and Angew. Chem. The catalyst is generally prepared by the reaction of magnesium hydride and titaniumtetrachloride in a hydrocarbon at a temperature of 90 C for 2 hours. Said catalyst is usable after simply having been dried in vacuum without any further treatment. Activity and surface area of the catalyst are readily controllable by the variation of the molar ratio of magnesium hydride to titanium tetrachloride. Thus, a catalyst prepared with a molar ratio of magnesium hydride to titanium tetrachloride of 40 1 has a surface 4 to 5 times larger and an activity 3 to 4 times higher than those of a catalyst prepared with said ratio being 1 1. The titanium load of the catalyst may be adjusted within limits between 4 and 15 by weight. Thus, in comparison to the previous Ziegler catalysts, smaller amounts of titanium tetrachloride are required. Furthermore, the time consuming pre treatment of the catalyst such as, e.g., grinding in a ball mill for 24 hours in the presence of various additives, are no longer required to produce specific surface areas. In detail the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of polyolefins, polydienes and copolymers thereof by polymerization in solvents, liquid monomers or in the gaseous phase at a temperature between 20 C and 150 C using magnesium hydride, a halogen containing transition metal compound of Group IV and an aluminium alkyl compound, characterized in that the polymerization is carried out in the presence of a catalyst system obtained by a reaction comprising the steps of When the magnesium hydride prior to the reaction with titanium tetrachloride is subjected to a treatment with hydrogen chloride, then a catalyst system is formed which, even upon reaction with an excess of titanium chloride only contains low amounts of titanium 1 to 3 by weight while it has an activity higher by 3 to 4 times than the system obtained using an untreated magnesium hydride. In order to attain a maximum polymerization activity, in the present process aluminium alkyl amounts in a molar ratio aluminium to titanium of 10 1 are required. With most of the prior art catalysts the required molar ratios are 100 1 or more. Thus, the amount of the aluminium alkyl which is difficult to handle is also reduced. The process according to the invention is preferably carried out in the presence of a catalyst consisting of titanium tetrachloride, magnesium hydride or its reaction product with hydrogen chloride or chlorine, respectively, and aluminium triethyl. It is further preferred that the catalyst has been prepared at a molar ratio of magnesium hydride to titanium tetrachloride of from 10² 1 to 10 ² 1, and preferably at a ratio of 40 1. The process according to the invention is further charactrized in that in the polymerization an aluminium titanium ratio of from 10² 1 to 1 1, and preferably of 10 1 is employed and that the polymerization in solvents is preferably carried out at a titanium concentration of from 10 ² to 10 ⁴ mol l. When the polymerization is carried out in a solvent, it is advantageous to employ catalyst concentrations of 10 ³ mol l, based on titanium. The most appropriate temperature is from 20 C to 100 C, and preferably at 30 C. By a suitable selection of the polymerization temperature the molecular weight of the produced polyethylene may be adjusted to a value within a wide range of, e.g., from 600 000 at 60 C to 7 000 000 at 0 C. A reduction in molecular weight may also be effected by polymerization in the presence of hydrogen. The produced polyethylene in general is one having a high molecular weight in excess of 1 million and exhibits a molecular weight distribution M The density and molecular weight are controlled by polymerizing in the presence of small amounts of α olefins such as, e.g., butene and hexene. In the homopolymerization of α olefins such as, e.g., propene and butene, an isotactic polypropylene or polybutene, respectively, is prepared by using the above catalyst system. Contrary to the previously known systems, it is not required to use any additives, for example electron donors such as e.g., benzoic acid ethyl ester or the like. In the copolymerization of ethylene with propene or butene there are obtained copolymers the compositions of which can deliberately be chosen. In accordance with the IR spectroscopical results the propene or butene units, respectively, are present in said copolymers in the form of blocks. The attached Figure shows the IR spectrum of a poly ethylene butene 1 copolymer. The peak at 770 cm ¹ relates to the proportion of polybutene sequences cf. Hummel Scholl, Atlas der Polymer und Kunststoffanalyse, vol. 1, page 11, spectrum 33 . If in the polymerization of ethylene only small traces of an α olefin such as, e.g., propene or butene are added, then an increase by the factor 2 of the polymerization activity is observed. The present invention is further illustrated by the following non limiting examples. A 250 ml two neck flask pre conditioned by heating and purging with argon was charged with 3.4 g 0.13 moles of MgH₂ and 100 ml of dry toluene. The MgH₂ had been prepared according to the procedure described by Bogdanovic DE OS 28 04 445 1979 . Analytical data 83.78 Mg 5.68 C 7.60 H 1.03 Ti 2.55 Cl. After 15 minutes of pre treatment in an ultrasonic bath 0.6 g 0.003 moles of TiCl₄ in 20 ml of toluene were dropwise added, and the mixture was stirred and heated at 90 C for 2 hours. The final product was washed several times with fresh dry toluene and dried under vacuum for 10 hours. There were obtained 3.7 g of a finely divided grey powder having a specific surface area of 141 m² g. Analytical data 4.81 Ti 14.85 Cl. On the analogy of Example 1 there were charged 22.68 g 0.86 moles of MgH₂ in 150 ml of dry toluene. Analytical data 90.10 Mg 2.24 C 5.71 H 0.67 Ti 0.99 Cl. After the treatment in an ultrasonic bath the black grey suspension was thermostated at 90 C, and gaseous hydrogen chloride was passed therethrough for 7 hours. Upon washing several times with toluene there were obtained 29.2 g of a light grey fine powder. Analytical data 64.88 Mg 4.14 C 3.90 H 0.77 Ti 23.84 Cl. 15.51 g 0.41 moles of this substance were reacted as in Example 1 with 78.46 g 0.41 moles of TiCl₄ to give 15.71 g of a light brown fine powder. Analytical data 0.98 Ti 25.96 Cl. A 500 ml glass autoclave pre conditioned by heating and purging with argon was charged with 312 mg of a catalyst prepared as in Example 1 and having a Ti content of 4.81 0.31 millimoles of Ti in 270 ml of toluene. Prior to use the catalyst in 50 ml of toluene had been pre treated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. The dark brown suspension was thermostated at 20 C, degassed by multiple short time application of vacuum and saturated with ethylene under a static pressure of 2 bar. Then 0.09 ml 0.63 millimoles of triethylaluminium were charged in an ethylene countercurrent into a glass vessel mounted inside the reactor and surrounded by the slightly agitated catalyst suspension thereby being adjusted to the same temperature. Following a renewed saturation with ethylene under 2 bar, by means of a spontaneous increase of the rotation speed of the stirrer the aluminium component was rinsed from the vessel and mixed with the catalyst suspension within less than 1 second. Within 10 seconds there appeared segregated polymer flakes within the otherwise clear light brown liquid. The reaction was monitored with a flow meter under a constant ethylene pressure of 2 bar. In the course of 9 minutes the temperature rose to more than 45 C and then slowly decreased to 30 C. After 20 minutes the reaction was stopped by addition of methanol, the polymer was stirred in a methanol HCl mixture, filtrated, several times washed with methanol and dried under vacuum. The yield was 23.9 g of a white fine grain powder. The activity was calculated to be 4 825 g of polyethylene PE per gram titanium and per hour. The average molecular weight as determined by viscosimetry was 3 700 000. In the homopolymerization of higher α olefins the reaction was monitored by means of a pressure recorder. The monomer is added to a pressurization up to 2 bar. After a pressure drop to 1.6 bar the curve of pressure vs. time is linear and the monomer is again added under pressure. Propene was polymerized at 20 C using 399 mg catalyst prepared according to Example 1 having a titanium content of 10.68 0.89 millimoles and 0.24 ml 1.78 millimoles of aluminium triethyl. The polymerization procedure as further carried out was on the analogy of Example 3. After 30 minutes the yield was 4.1 g of isotactic polypropylene PP having a soft consistency and an average molecular weight of 150 000. The activity was 200 g of PP per gram titanium and per hour. Butene was polymerized at 20 C on the analogy of Example 4. The pressure was measured within the range of from 1 bar to 0.6 bar. Upon use of 769 mg of catalyst prepared according to Example 1 having a titanium content of 7.29 1.17 millimoles and 0.32 ml 2.34 millimoles of triethyl aluminium, there were obtained after a polymerization period of 1 hour 4.0 g of a soft isotactic polybutene having an average molecular weight of 260 000. The activity was calculated to be 70 g of polybutene PB per gram titanium and per hour. The polymerization was carried out on the analogy of Example 3. Prior to saturation with ethylene there were introduced 16 g of butene 1 by condensation. Upon pressurization with ethylene to 2 bar the polymerization was initiated by increasing the revolution of the stirrer. Upon use of 501 mg 0.76 millimoles of catalyst according to Example 5 and 0.21 ml 1.52 millimoles of triethyl aluminium, there were obtained after 20 minutes 14.8 g of a copolymer having an average molecular weight of 150 000. The PE PB copolymer is composed of crystalline PE regions and isotactic PB blocks. The activity is 1220 g of polymer per gram titanium and per hour, as compared to 70 g of polymer per gram titanium and per hour for neat butene and 910 g of polymer having a molecular weight of 1,100,000 per gram titanium and per hour for neat ethylene. Using 610 mg of a catalyst prepared in accordance with Example 2, having a Ti content of 0.98 0.12 millimoles and 0.17 ml 1.25 millimoles of triethyl aluminium, ethylene was polymerized at 30 C and under a pressure of 2 bar on the analogy of Example 3. The segregation of the polymer flakes was also to be observed, however the flakes themselves were smaller than with a polyethylene produced using a catalyst prepared according to Example 1. After 30 minutes the yield of a white fine grain polyethylene having an average molecular weight of 1 100 000 was 44.7 g. Therefrom the activity was calculated to be 14 950 g of PE per gram titanium and per hour. At the same Ti concentration of 0.35 mmol l and a molar ratio of aluminium titanium of 10 1 polyethylene was prepared using catalyst as in Example 7 at various temperatures for a period of 30 minutes each. The results were as follows Using 854 mg of a catalyst prepared in accordance with Example 2 having a Ti content of 1.55 0.28 millimoles and 0.08 ml 0.056 millimoles of triethyl aluminium, propene was polymerized on the analogy of Example 4. The yield after 60 minutes was 20.3 g of polypropylene having an average molecular weight of 200 000. The activity was found to be 1 540 g of PP per gram titanium and per hour.
