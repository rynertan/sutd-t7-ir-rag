# Ultrasonic flowmeter.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the measurement of fluid flow, particularly flow rates for compressible fluids, comprises at least four transducer sources 3 of ultrasonic energy arranged in fluid conduit system 1 and adapted to project a beam of ultrasonic sound to corresponding receivers 3 , the paths a, b, c, d defined by the beams being angularly disposed with regard to both the fluid flow and each other, and being arranged in an intersecting but spaced apart relationship.
