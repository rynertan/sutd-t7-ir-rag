# Hydrogen gas generation utilizing a bromide electrolyte, an amorphous silicon semiconductor and radiant energy.

## Abstract
Radiant energy in conjunction with an amorphous silicon semiconducting electrode to at least partially power an elec trolytic cell is used in the generation of hydrogen, utilizing a bromide, preferably hydrogen bromide, as the essential elec trolyte component in the electrolytic cell to solve overvoltage and corrosion problems associated with the use of conven tional electrolytes in similar environments. The use of the bromide electrolyte results in the broadening of the selection of semiconductor electrodes which can be used in the process and apparatus of the present invention enabling the amorph ous silicon semiconducting electrode to be used with superior anticorrosive and radiant energy gathering results over con ventional systems. To insure against corrosion, the amorph ous silicon semiconductor should preferably be used with a thin layer of platinum overcoating. The hydrogen generated from such system can be used to power a fuel cell.
