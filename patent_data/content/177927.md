# 3 Hydroxybenzo b thiophene 2 sulfide derivatives as specific 5 lipoxygenase inhibitors

## Abstract
3 hydroxybenzo b thiophene 2 sulfide derivatives of formula These compounds have been found to be specific inhi bitors of 5 lipoxygenase and thereby useful in the treatment of inflammation, pain and fever associated with inflam mation, arthritic conditions, asthma, allergic disorders, skin diseases, cardiovascular or vascular disorders, and other leukotriene mediated diseases. Furthermore, these com pounds have been found to exhibit cytoprotective activity which does not involve the inhibition of gastric acid secre tion but can be used at relatively low dosages for increasing the resistance of gastro intestinal mucosa to strong irri tants. A process for preparing those compounds is also dis closed.
