# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SEPARATING MIXED GAS.

## Abstract
A mixed gas separation method in which a product gas is collected from a raw material gas by a pressure difference adsorption technique in which a pressurized adsorption operation and a reduced pressure desorption operation are successively repeated. In order to reduce the length of an adsorption zone in each of adsorption towers A1, A2, B1, B2, ... , and reduce adsorption zone turbulence, pressure difference adsorption units UA, UB, UC, ..., UX constituting a plurality of stages are employed, and a refined gas or a concentrated refined gas obtained in the previous stage pressure difference adsorption units UA, UB, UC, ... is directly introduced 2A, 2B,... to subsequent stage pressure difference adsorption units UB, UC,... UX , respectively, and separated. The waste gas produced in the reduced pressure desorption operation in the subsequent stage pressure difference adsorption units UB, UC, ...UX is introduced 3B, 5A, 3C, 5B, ... to pressurize the adsorption towers A1, A2, B1, B2, ... of the previous stage pressure difference adsorp tion units UA, UB, UC, ... . The invention is particularly suitable for collecting argon and oxygen.
