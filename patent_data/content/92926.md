# Background subtraction in a charge transfer device method and apparatus thereof.

## Abstract
In a charge transfer device an auxiliary charge store and gate GA is provided adjacent to the devices input 9 ie adjacent to the device source S , or to the device first store beneath GS , or to both. In order to provide background subtraction, charge is transferred back and forth, under auxiliary gate control, between the device input 9 and the auxiliary store beneath GA many times during each period of charge integration and a fixed increment of charge is removed for each such transfer. The total charge subtracted each integration period is dependent on the number of transfers this latter is determined by the frequency of a control signal applied to the auxiliary gate GA . This frequency may be set manually, or may be servoed by output circuitry in order to set an automatic adaptive threshold.

## Description
Background Subtraction in a Charge Transfer Device Method andApparatus thereforTECHNICAL FIELD Ttis invention concerns background subtraction in a charge transfer device CTD particularly in an infra red charge coupled device ER CCD a charge coupled device CCD incorporated in the structure of an infra red image sensor as also in other CCDs and bucket brigade devices BEDs .A typical infra red image sensor comprises an array of detector elEments for example infra red sensitive photodiodes elements ar anged in rows and columns. Each column of elements is read out means of a multiple input CCD register an input register, and e h input register is read out by means of another multiple inputCCD register an output register. Each input register fulfils two functions. Firstly, it enables the signal from the elements to be read out in a sequence. Secondly, it enables time integration of each signal, as representative sample charge is accumulated in the input storage wells stores of the CCD during each sampling interval this resulting in noise smooth nag and thus improvement of signal over noise and ideally this sampling interval is as long as is possible.In practice, however, the sampling interval the integration period is limited by CCD well storage capacity and by the maximum signal current handled. Typically, in 8 to 14 um band sensitive CMT on silicon sensors the integration period is very short, limited to an interval of tbe order of tens of microseconds. All the elements in the array must be read out in this time, if the hottest partsof the image scene are to be resolved. Thus even in an array of modest size eg 32 x 32 elements the output register readout rate is rapid.For 8 32 x 32 element array and a sampling period of 50 ps, the read out rate at output would need to be 50 na per element pixel ie a rate of 20 MHz. Such rates are very fast for CODs and this imposes stringent requirements on the design of COD used.The photodiode signal, as also the representative charge accumulated during sampling of the signal, may be considered as comprised of two components one component, a background component of relatively large magnitude, dependent on scene ambient temperature the other component, a component of much smaller magnitude, dependent on scene temperature difference above ambient. It is the latter small component only that conveys the contrast information of the scene.Background subtraction is used to remove, or at least to substantially reduce, the background component. PRIOR ARTOne method of background subtraction, a ocalled char e skimming method, has been described by Orator tt Alexander Ct al in a paper entitled An extrinsic Silicon Charge Coupled Device fc DetectingInfra red Radiation , IEDM, Washing n DC, Tech. Digest 442 5 1974 . According to this method, charge is accumulated in a first input well, and as this well saturates and overflows, excess charge is accumulated in a second well immediately adjacent to the first.This excess charge is then clocked along the transfer channel of theCOD and read out. According to a variant of this method, and during a somewhat extended sampling period, the first input well is emptied periodically.The method described however, only compounds problems of device nonuniformity. Though common control voltages can be applied to each of the several device inputs control gates, the effective well potentials that are developed are very sensitive to material parameters. It is difficult, if not impossible to control these parameters to sufficient tolerance to ensure that the input well potentials are identical. Thus the charge subtracted from one input will differ from that subtracted at another, and the output signal produced will thus contain fixed pattern noiseBy way of background, reference is also made to a paper given byBrugler Jaspers entitled Charge Pumping in MOS Devices , IEEETrans. Electron Devices, ED 16 No 3 pages 297 302 March 1969 .In this paper the authors have identified and analysed charge pumping, an effect found to limit the sensitivity of charge storage rlode operation of phototransitors or diodes.

It is possible to define the number of increments each period precisely, and although the increment size will depend on device parameters eg gate electrode dimensions, inter surface state density these parameters can be maintained uniform within adequate tolerance over extensive area of the device.It is thus possible to remove charge with reasonable precision, and thus reduce the contribution t o fixed pattern noise considerably, whilst retaining the benefits of charge subtraction. Furthermore, as charge is subtracted in a quasi continuous manner during integration, charge accumulates more slowly, and a longer period can be allowed for integration. This allows more effective smoothing of noise, particularly of the lower frequency noise components. Also if the method is applied in an infra red image sensor of the kind described above, the output register can be operated at a relatively slow rate, and the choice of COD design is thus less restrictive.In further accordance with the invention there is provided apparatus for performing the method herein disclosed, this apparatus comprising the combination of a charge transfer device including a source, a drain, a plurality of stores between the source and the drain, and transfer gates for controlling the transfer of charge from store to store a control. circuit for controlling periodic release of charge accumulated in the first store nearest the source, from the first to a second store, each release following a period of integration and, a phase clock connected to the transfer gates of the device, for applying phase 6i nals to thone gates to transfer charge from store to store and to the drain the apparatus being chalgcterised 1E an auxiliary store and gate adjacent the source. and or the first store and, a control generator connected to the auxiliary gate, to apply a time variant voltage gate signal, to effect a repeated interchange of charge between the source, the first store, or both, and the auxiliary store, to interchange charge many times each period of integration. The apparatus nay be an infra red image sensor system, one in which the charge transfer device has a multiplicity of inputs, the source and or the first store of each input being associated with a corresponding auxiliary gate and store the system including a multiplicity of infra red detecting elements arranged in an array, each one controlling a corresponding one of the device sources, and, a common signal generator connected to each one of the auxiliary gates.It is convenient to include as signal generator, one providing a periodic voltage signal either continuous eg sinusoid, square wave, triangular wave or pulsed. It is preferable that the generator is capable of adjustment, to enable adjustment of gate signal frequency, fundamental frequency or pulse repetition frequency.Adjustment may be manual, allowing the user to set 2 common subtraction threshold to optimise response for different scene background levels, or to emphasise high level features of interest.This adjustment could be automated. The generator could be connected to respond to signal output circuits and used to apply an adaptive threshold.In yet further accordance with this invention there is provided a charge coupled device for use as the charge transfer device in the apparatus disclosed above, this device comprising a semiconductor substrate including doped regions providing device source and drain a layer of insulating material extending over the surface of the substrate means delineating a charge transfer channel of the substrate extending between source and drain a plurality of transfer electrodes arranged above the insulating layer and along the device, each extending across the channel, a first one of these electrodes being immediately adjacent to the source the device being characterised by an auxiliary gate electrode, also immediately adjacent to the sourcePreferably, the gate electrode and the first transfer electrode are n.haped so that together they surround the source.The transfer channel may be a surface channel as in a SCCD or a buried channel as in a BCCD .BRIEF I iRODUCTION OF T DFJWINGS In the drawings accompanying this application Figure 1 is an illustrative cross sectíon of a charge coupled device, a device mcdified to facilitate charge subtraction Figure 2 is a plan view of the input structure of an alternative charge coupled device, a device also modified to facilitate charge subtract ion Figures 3 and 4 show respectively in cross section and folded cross section the input structure of the device shown in figure 2 above, sections taken along lines X X and Y Y of that figurc Figure 5 is an illustrative drawing of an in ra red image sensor showing tbe organisation of sensor elements and COD and, figure 6 is a circuit diagra of a NOSFET bucket brigade device arranged to facilitate charge subtraction.DESCRIPTION OF PREFErRED EMBODIMENTSThe invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to embodiments shewn in the accompanying drawings.An infra red imaging charge coupled device, which for the most part is of conventional design, is shown in simplified form in figure 1.It comprises a substrate 1 of semiconductor material, a region S of which is doped by implantation or by diffusion to provide the the source S of the device. At the remote end of this device, another region is likewise doped to provide the device drain D.Metal contacts for the source contact SS and for the drain contact DD are provided. The base of the substrate 1 is coated with a metallic layer 5, to provide the ground contact E of the device. The upper surface of the substrate 1 is covered by a layer 7 of insulating material, which provides isolation between a set of transfer electrodes and the semiconductor material of the substrate 1.The Set of transfer electrodes cor prises a first electrode immediately adjacent the source S the input gate G1 and this is followed by a storage control gate Gs a transfer control gate GT and, a p urality of phase gates, arranged in groups of four, gates ç 2 b3 4 of which one group only is shown. Each of the 1haste gates f 29 3 and is connected to a different phase line of a 4 phase control clock not shown .The set of transfer electrodes span the space between the device source S and the drain D, and extend across a transfer channel delineated in the substrate 1 by means of an isolation boundary a boundary of dopant enriched material or of thick oxide B.A sensing element, an infra red photosensitive detector photodiode P is connected at the input contact SS of the device.Charge is injected into the source 3, and is accumulated, in the first store of the device, a region beneath the storage gateFrom here it is transferred to stores beneath the phase gates 2 f3 and 4 under the control of the phase clock and a control circuit not shown connected to the transfer gate GT. In addition to the conventional structure thus far described, the device includes an auxiliary gate CA This is located on the opposite side of the source to the first electrode, input gate CI It could instead be located to one side of the source S, or even alongside the first electrode GI, and preferably it is patterned to surround the remaining perimeter of the source contact 55. The diode P may be one of many, arranged in one or two dimensional array, and the device may be accordingly of complex structure. A two dimenaWonal array implementation is shown schematically in figure 5. In this structure the device has multiplicity of loading inputs 9. The structure of each loading input 9 corresponds to the input part of the device shown in figure 1, the region of the device extending from the auxiliary gate GA and source S, to the transfer gate CT inclusive.The signal charge of each input is transferred into a corresponding storage location 9 of an input register 11 and from parallel input registers 11 into an output register 13 where it is transferred to the device drain D to develop 8 serial output signal.During operation, charge subtraction is effected by applying a time variant voltage control signal, for example a cyclic signal which varies between a Hi level and a Lo level each cycle, to each auxiliary gate GA.The principle of operation is as follows as the gate voltage on an auxiliary gate CA goes Hi, charge is attracted from the source S and from the first store under the transfer electrode as, into the auxi iary store, the region beneath the auxiliary gate GA, ie into an inversion layer. Subsequently as this gate voltage goes to during the remaining part of the time variant signal cycle, charge is returned to the source S and first store.However, some of the charge, an increment EQ of charge, recombines and appears as substrate current ie current flowing between the input diode P and the substrate S. This subtracted increment contains two counponents, one corresponding to recombination via surface sttan, the other corresponding to recombination in the bulk. Each time charge is interchanged between the source S, the first store and the auxiliary store, the increment LQ subtracted is given by alpha Qp q NST AG , where AQ net trapped charge per gate cycle C a fraction of free carriers under auxiliary gate that recombines in the bulk Qp free charge density in the inversion layer G cm2 q electronic charge C NST total fast inter surface state density contributing to the charge pumping effect cm 2 and, AG area of the auxiliary gate.The substrate current 1B thus produced, as increments are removed each cycle of the auxiliary gate signal, is thus given by 1B AQ.. fG AG f a CO VG VT q NST s where the frequency, fundamental frequency or pulse repetition frequency of the auxiliary gate voltage signal C oxide capacitance per unit area F 1cm Vc auxiliary gate voltage V and VT a threshold voltage V .Thus the total charge QT removed during an integration period T is simply QT IB T T fG . T Thus by pulsing or modulating the voltage on the auxiliary 8ate GA, some of the photocurrent charge that would be stored under the storage gate Gs, flows under the auxiliary gate and is pumped away.Hence a fixed amount of charge can be bled off and dumped. in this way the background charge can be subtracted to leave the wanted signal charge. Because now the charge flowing into the first store accumulates rkore slowly, the integration time can be increased and hence the sensitivity of the array improved. Because the amount of pumped current is proportional to gate signal frequency, the amount of background subtraction can be controlled accurately, to much the same precision as the frequency. If the scene background changes, the background subtraction can be changed by adjusting the auxiliary gate control frequency.For example if the ambient temperature changes ire say 300 to 320 0K the frequency of the gate signal can be increased so that more background charge is subtracted.An alternative CCD structure is shown in figures 2, 3 and 4. In this structure the auxiliary store, which is located beneath the auxiliary gate GA, is isolated from the source S. As shown, the auxiliary gate GA is located adjacent the input electrode S and the input gate GI, both of which are foreshortened. The source S and auxiliary store are isolated by mcans of an insulating barrier 15, an extension of the excess doped boundary 17 used to delineate the transfer channel 19. The far end of the auxiliary gate GA is immediately adjacent part of the storage gate Cs. there the time variant control signal is applied to the auxiliary gate GA, charge is irterchanged between the first store, ie the region beneath the storage gate Gs, and the auxiliary store, ie the region beneath the auxiliary gate CA As typical example, the substrate 1 may be of p type silicon single crystal, klOO cut, material of resistivity between 10 and 20 Qcm the source diffusion 3s and the drain diffusion, of depth approx 1.8 um and sheet resistivity approx 150 Q sq the insulating o material silicon oxide of thickness 1200 A. Typical electrode dimensions are as follows auxiliary store gate GA 80 m long x 25 pm wide input control gate GI 20 wtn long x 200 pm wide and, storage gate C5 transfer gate CT phase gates l toEMI11.1 20 ijm long x 230 pm wide.A bucket brigade device BBD is shown in the circuit diagram of figure 6, a fully integrated MOS structure. As in a BBD of conventional structure see for e Lple Philips Tech Review 31, pages 97 110 1970 it comprises a series of capacitative charge stores C, lying between the source S of an input MOSFET 21 and the drain D of a terminal, ie output, MOSFET 23. Transfer of sample charge from store to store, and to output O P, is controlled by MDSSET transistor switches 25, which are each connected between the store capacitors C.The drain contact D of each transistor switch 25 is connected to the source contact S of the next switch 25, and each store capacitor C bridges the drain contact Dv and control gate Cv of a corresponding transistor switch 25. Alternate transistor gates Gt are connected to a different one of two phase lines Pl or P2, which in turn are connected to a 2 phase control clock 27.The input MOSFET 21, however, is modified and controlled to provide charge subtraction. The source contact S and drain contact D of this MOSFET are connected in common and are associated with a photo diode P which provides the signal current. This current is sampled, and charge is accumulated in the first store, store C of the nearest NOSFET 25. As this charge accumulates, however, the voltage applied to the control gate C of the input transistor 21 is varied under the control of an auxiliary generator 29. Charge from the source S and drain D t of the input transistor 21, and from the source S and drain D of the adjacent transistor 25 and the first store C, is thus transferred to and from auxiliary store ie a region beneath the control gate G of the input transistor 21 as the auxiliary gate voltage varies. This results in charge pumping action and the removal of many increments of charge, in manner similar to that already described.
