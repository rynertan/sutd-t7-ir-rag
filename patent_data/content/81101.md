## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TREATING WHOLE BLOODThis invention relates to a process and apparatus for treating whole blood either to separate out plasma or to oxygenate the blood in a manner to permit continuous recirculation of the treated whole blood to the donor.There are available at the present time a wide variety of blood oxygenationapparatus and plasmapheresis apparatus. Present plasmapheresis devices separate the whole blood of a blood donor in order to recover the plasma which then can be given to a patient requiring a transfusion.Plasmapheresis devices also are utilized to remove the plasma from the whole blood of a patient suffering from diseases associated with an excessively active immunological system that produce excess antibodies such as systemic lupus erythematosus,myasthenia gravis, or Goodpasture s syndrome. In either instance, it is desirable to return the concentrated whole blood to the patent or the donor since, in the former instance, such practice permits the donor to give blood again within a period time about one quarter of that required when the whole blood is donated.In the latter instance, such a practice permits treating the patient s entire blood volume in a single treatment.In both instances, the advantages of such a practice are obvious since it permits either an increased quantity of donated blood per donor or increased effective treatment of a dangerous disease.It has been proposed to provide a method and apparatus for extracting blood to form a plasma fraction and an enriched blood fraction in U.S. patent 3,705,100. The apparatus utilizes a reservoir for whole blood and a filtration membrane as well as a flow directing means and a pressure generating means for passing the blood adjacent the membrane thereby effecting the desired filtration.The primary disadvantage of this device is that it is a batsch device and. it is incapable of continuously treating blood from a patent and for continuously recirculating enriched blood to the patent. This, of course, is undesirable since it greatly increases the time required for treating a given volume of blood and subjects the patient to multiple punctures in order to obtain samples to be treated.It also has been reported in the final report of NHLBIContract No. 1 HB 6 2928, June, 1976 April, 1979 to theAmerican Red Cross to utilize a blood filtration system that permits continuous withdrawal of blood and continuous reintroduction of enriched blood back to the patent.However, this device requires a recirculating system for passing blood through a channel and adjacent filter a multiplicity of times The recirculating system is required to achieve proper balance between shear forces on the blood and pressure drop for the channel height utilized thereby to minimize blood damage. While the desired balance is achieved, the increased surface exposure for the recirculating blood necessitated thereby also increases the risk of blood damage thereby rendering the apparatus undesirable. In addition U.S. patent 4,191,182 to Popovich discloses a plasmapheresis apparatus that requires an undesirable recirculating system for blood in order to maintain the perceived required shear stresses during filtration. Membrane oxygenators are available wherein blood and oxygen containing gas are passed into contact on opposing surface of a membrane and wherein oxygen is transferred through the membrane into the blood while carbon dioxide is transferred from the blood through the membrane dioxide is transferred from the blood through the membrane into the oxygen containing stream. Presently available membrane oxygenators provide a relatively thick blood film of generally greater than 0,2 mm. The factor limiting efficiency in such devices is resistance to oxygen diffusion in the blood film.One approach to reducing this resistance is typified byU.S. patent 4,168,293 in which a woven screen is introduced into the blood channel to induce mixing of the blood.This approach, however, leads to blood damage and potential thrombus formation, especially if used for long term respiratory support.Another approach is typified by Bellhouse et al, Transactions of American Society of Artificial Internal Organs, VolumeXIX, 1973, page 72, which describes a furrowed membrane and a pulsatile pumping system also intended to create mixing within the blood channels. While potentially less damaging to the blood than a mixing screen, the device and its associated hardware are complex and costly to manufacture.The o,LI mm blood film thickness of this device is what leads to the necessity for such measures. It would be highly desirable to provide a membrane device for processing blood whose blood channels approached the the human dimensions of the microcirculation of the t toddy less than 0,1 mm diameter or height . The high surface to volume ratio of such a device would allow the separation of blood into a plasma stream and an enriched blood stream to be reintroduced into the patient in a single pass through the device. Such a device would minimize both blood damage and blood priming volume.Utilized as a blood oxygenator, the high surface to volume ratio would gi ve inherently high efficiency. Further increase in efficiency results from shear augmentation of oxygen diffusion without the need for blood damaging mixing screens or elaborate externally driven systems.It is therefore one main object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for treating whole blood to effect material transfer from or into whole blood, especially transfer of oxygen into the whole blood or transfer of plasma out of the whole blood to obtain a plasma fraction and a plasma depleted, enriched blood fraction, which apparatus allows to effectively treat the whole blood without the need of an externally driven system and without blood damaging. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for treating whole blood, allowing an effective treatment without the need to pump the blood or to use blood damaging mixing screens.Further objects will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the following description of preferred embodiments of the invention.Said and other objects are achieved by the apparatus and the process as set forth in appending claims.According to the present invention there is provided a multilayer membrane construction comprising a plurality of contiguous membrane units each of which consists of two membrane layers and two spacer layers. The spacer layers are in alternating relationship with the two membrane layers. In the plasmapheresis embodiment, one spacer layer has a plurality of channels having a critical height between about 0,02 and about 0,1 mm. It is desirable that the channels have a length between 1 and about 10 cm and a width between about 0,05 and 0,5 cm. This spacer layer has an inlet means for introducing whole blood into the channels and an outlet means for accumulating blood depleted of plasma from the channels. The second spacer includes a plurality of channels each of which are connected to a plasma outlet adapted to collect plasma from the whole blood.The membrane units are sealed so that whole blood or plasma depleted blood is prevented from passing into the plasma outlet.In the blood oxygenator embodiment, one spacer layer utilized for blood flow has a plurality of channels each of which is between about 0,02 and about 0,1 mm in height. The total channel surface area for all spacer layers is between about 0,5 m2 and 2,0 m2. The channels in a first spacer adjacent a first surface of a membrane layer connect an oxygen gas inlet and a gas outlet. The channels of a second spacer utilized for blood flow adjacent a second surface of the filter layer connect a blood inlet and a blood outlet which are sealed from the gas inlet and gas outlet. In both embodiments the membrane and spacers must be securely bonded to each other over their entire mating surface. This bonding secures the membrane between adjacent spacer elements and thus limits changes in channel height to local membrane deflection. The width of the individual channels represents the span over which the membrane is free to deflect and is determined by the mechanical properties of typical membrane materials. The combination of the above factors allows critical control of channel heights of less than 0,1 mm. In the following preferred embodiments of the apparatus in accordance with the present invention will be more fully described with references to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an exploded view of the blood plasma pheresis filter unit of this invention.

Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view of the housing in Fig. 6 taken along line 8 8. Fig. 9 is an exploded view of the blood oxygenator filter unit of this invention. Fig. 10 is a top view of the blood oxygenator filter unit. Fig. 11 is a cross sectional view of the filter unit of Fig. 10 taken along line 11 11. Fig. 12 is a cross sectional view of the filter unit of Fig. 10 taken along line 12 12. As shown in Fig. 1, the filter unit 10 comprises, a first membrane 12, a second membrane 14, a first spacer 16, and a second spacer 18. Both the first membrane 12 and the second membrane 14 are of identical construction and are formed from a pliable hydrophilic microporous filter material and having an average pore size extending in submicrometer range from about 0,2 and 1,0 micrometers, preferably between about 0,5 and 0,7 micrometers, currently marketed by Millipore cirporation and identified as MF Millipore , Celotate a, Durapor hydrophilic filters,Duralo filter, Duralor filter, Polyvic filters, Solvere filters, and Microwe filters. Each membrane 12 and 14 is provided with two longitudinal channels 20 and 22 and a widthwide channel 24.The widthwise channel 24 is not in fluid communication with either of the channels 20 or 22. The first spacer comprises of plurality of channels 32 which extend from edge 26 to edge 28 and an outlet channel 30. When membranes 12 and 14 are contiguous to spacer 16, the edges 26 and 28 coincide with the edges 25 and 27 respectively.The second spacer 18 is provided with whole blood inlet channel 34, a blood outlet 36 and a widthwise plasma outlet channel 38. The second spacer 18 also is provided with interior channels 40 which provide fluid communication with channel 42 which in turn is in fluid communication with plasma outlet channel 38. lhen spacer 18 is juxtaposed to membrane 14, edges 37 and 39 coincide respectively with edges 25 and 27 of spacer 14. The spacer strips 33 between channels 32 and the spacer strips 31 between the channels 40 are bonded to the next adjacent membrane and provide the necessary support for the membranes adjacent the channels so that membrane flexibility is controlled to maintain the desired channel height.The channels 32 in first spacer 16 should have a particular height, width and length in order to accommodate the normal blood flow rate from a donor so that blood can be removed continuously while enriched blood from plasma has been removed can be reintroduced continuously to the donor.In addition, the channel height must be regulated so that the wall shear rate and pressure drop are in the proper range not to cause significant blood damage. Accordingly, it is essential that the channels 32 in the first spacer 16 have a height between about 0,02 and about 0,1 mm, preferably between about 0,06 and 0,09 mm. Furthermore, it is preferred that the channels 32 have a cumulative width between about 20 and about 100 cm, an individual width between 0,05 cm and 0,5 cm and a length between about 1 and about 10 cm, preferably a cumulative width between about 50 and about 70 cm, for all of the channels in all of the first spacers an individual width between 0,08 and 0,12 cm, and a length between about 4 and about 6 cm.It has been found that with typical blood flow rate from a donor of about 60 and about 70 ml min and a typical blood outlet pressure between about 50 and about 80 mm Hg, utilization of a spacer having the channel size of this invention, shear rates of between 1000 and 3000 sec.can be obtained which effects substantial prevention of hemolysis at the corresponding transmembrane pressures.Referring to Fig. 2, the channels 32 of first spacer 16 are shown to overlap into channel 20 and 22 of membrane 14.This overlap permits introduction of whole blood into channel 29, passage of the whole blood lengthwise along channels 32 wnile being in contact with membrane 14 and removal of plasma depleted blood from channels 32 through widthwise channel 22.Referring to Fig. 3, the second spacer 44 can comprise a whole blood inlet 20 which is spaced apart from channels 46 by means of spacer width 48 so that blood in inlet 20 cannot pass directly into channels 46 but can only move through parallel channels 32 see Fig. 1 . Thus, only plasma which has passed through a membrane 14 or 12 can enter channels 46. In this configuration, the parallel channels 46 can overlap into a widthwise channel 24 see Fig. 1 or can beingfluid communication directly with a channel for removing plasma from the housing see Fig. 6 . The plasmadepleted blood outlet 22 also is insulated from parallel channels 46 by means of spacer section 50 so that plasma cannot be mixed with plasma depleted blood.Referring to Fig. Li, the second spacer 49 can comprise longitudinal channels 20 and 22 and parallel widthwise channels 50 which are in fluid communication with longitudinal channel 52. The channels 20 and 22 serve the purposes described above while channels 50 serve to direct plasma removed from the whole blood into channel 52 which is in fluid communication with means for removing plasma from the housing see Fig. 6 .Referring to Fig. 5, the second spacer 51 comprises longitudinal channels 20 and 22 which serve the purposes described above and an open space 24 within the central portion of the spacer 51. The open space 24 is in fluid communication with channel 54 which in turn is in fluid communication with a means for removing plasma from the housing see Fig. 6 . Alternatively the second spacer can comprise a woven mesh of a polymeric fiber material so as to provide space between adjacent membranes thereby to permit plasma flow to the plasma outlet. Referring to Figs. 6,7, and 8, the filter units of this invention are shown in stacked relationship within a housing 58. The whole blood inlet channel 20 of each membrane 12 and 14 and of each spacer 16 and 18 are aligned to form a vertical channel 20 within the housing 58. Whole blood is introduced into the channel 20 through inlet 60. The whole blood passes along channels 32 of spacer 16 into channel 22 which is utilized to collect plasma depleted blood. As with channel 20, channel 22 is formed by the alignments of channel 22 in each of membranes 12 and 14 and spacer 18 together with the fact that channels 3 owver p into chann el 22. The housing 58 is provided with an outlet62 which is utilized to withdraw plasma depleted blood from channel 22.The housing 58 is also provided with plasma outlet 64 which is in fluid communication with channel 35 which is formed by the alignments of channels 24 of membranes 12 and 14, channel 30 of spacer 16 and channel 38 of spacer 18.In operation, whole blood from a patient or donor enters housing 58 through inlet 60 and passes along channels 32 of spacer 16 widthwise through housing 58. While blood is passing through channels 32, the membranes 12 and 14 allow passage of plasma therethrough while preventing the remainder of the whole blood from passing therethrough.Similarly, whole blood is prevented from directly entering channels 40 or spacer 18 by means of sealing strips 48.Thus, whole blood is prevented from entering channel 22.The plasma which enters channels 40 of spacer 18 is directed through outlets 42 into channel 35. Channel 35 is connected to outlet 64. Suitable tube means are connected to outlets 62 and 64 and inlet 60 to permit withdrawal of whole blood directly from patient or donor and reintroduction of plasma depleted blood directly into the patient on a continuous one pass basis.As shown in Fig. 9, the filter unit 70 for the blood oxygenator comprises, a first membrane 72, a second membrane 74, a second spacer 76, and a first spacer 78. Both the first membrane 72 and a second membrane 74 are of identical construction and are formed from hydrophobic microporous membranes such as Fluoropore or Durapore hydrophobic or solid film such as polydimethylsiloxane, polyalkylsulfone or ethylcellulose perfluorobutyrate. Each membrane 72 and 74 is provided with two longitudinal channels 71 and 73 and two widthwise channels 75 and 77. The widthwise channels 75 and 77 are not in fluid communication with either of the channels 71 and 73.The second spacer 76 comprises of plurality of channels 79 which communicate with channels 75 and 77 when membranes 72 and 74 are contiguous to spacer 76 for passage of oxygen containing gas through the filter unit 70. Channels 79 of spacer 76 overlap channels 75 and 77 when spacer 76 is contiguous to membranes 74 and 76. The first spacer 78 is provided with interior channels 82 which provide fluid communication between longitudinal channels 71 and 73 when spacer 78 is juxtaposed to membranes 72 and 74 to permit passage of blood through the filter unit 70. The spacer strips 83 between channels 79 and 77 as well as the spacer strips 84 between the channels 82 are bonded to the next adjacent membranes and provide the necessary support for the membranes adjacent the channels so that membrane flexibility is controlled to maintain the desired channel height.The channels 82 in first spacer 78 should have a particular height, width and length in order to accommodate the normal blood flow rate from a patient so that blood can be removed continuously while oxygen enriched blood can be reintroduced continuously to the patient. In addition, the channel height must be regulated so that the wall shear rate is in the proper rage to give sufficient augmentation of oxygen transfer in the blood film. Accordingly, it is essential that the channels 82 in the first spacer 78 have a height between about 0,02 and about 0,1 mm. Furthermore, it is preferred that the channels have an individual width between 0,05 cm and 0,2 cm and a length between about 1 and about 10 cm, preferably an individual width between 0,08 and 0,12 cm.When utilizing the blood oxygenator shown in Figs. 9,10, 11, and 12, the filter units 70 of this invention are in stacked relationship within a housing 80, the whole blood inlet channel 71 is in fluid communication with channel 71. Whole blood is introduced into the channel 71 and passes along channels 82 of spacer 78 into channel 73 which is utilized to collect oxygenated blood for removal through blood outlet 81.In operation, whole blood from a patient enters housing80 through inlet 71 and passes along channels 82 of spacer 78.While blood is passing through channels 82, the membranes 72 and 74 allow passage of oxygen therethrough while preventing the blood from passing therethrough. Similarly, whole blood is prevented from directly entering channels 75 and 77 of spacer 78 by means of sealing strips 85 and 86. Oxygen enters gas inlet 87, passes into channel 75 and channels 79 and passes through membranes 72 and 74 into blood within channels 82. Oxygen depleted gas passes into channel 77 and out gas outlet 88. Oxygen gas is prevented from passing directly into the blood by means of sealing strips 89 and 90. The gas utilized generally has a pressure of between about 100 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg above atmospheric in order to effect transfer of oxygen in proper concentrations without causing gas bubbling through the filter or in the blood. A mixture of oxygen with other gases such as CO2, or N2 can be utilized. The oxygenated blood is directed through outlets 81 which can be connected to suitable tube means to permit withdrawal of whole blood directly from the patient and reintroduction of oxygenated blood directly into the patient on a coninuous one pass basis.
