# RADIATION DETECTOR

## Abstract
A detector for collecting radiation reflected from an information bearing surface and scanned by a flying spot scanner comprises an integrating cavity having at least one photodetector therein, with at least one inlet slot for the radiation. In a first embodiment, a scan beam passes through the cavity via first and second slots to scan essentially normal to the surface. Reflected radiation is directed back into the cavity through the second slot and is apodized to improve signal level uniformity at the photodetector. The cavity construction is also designed to provide start and end of scan signals.
