# Heterocyclic azo compounds having sulfate groups.

## Abstract
This invention relates to azo compounds prepared by diazotizing heterocyclic amines such as 2 amino benzothiazole, 3 amino 2,1 benzisothiazole, 2 amino 1,3,4 thiadiazole, 5 amino 1,2,4 thiadiazole, 5 aminoisothiazole, 5 aminopyrazole, 2 aminothiophene, followed by coupling with certain aniline, tetrahydroquinoline, or benzomorpholine compounds containing sulfate groups. These compounds are useful as dyes for polyamide fibers and also impart color to cellulose acetate fibers and wool.
