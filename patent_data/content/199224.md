# Method and system for monitoring position of a fluid actuator employing microwave resonant cavity principles.

## Abstract
A system 10 and method for monitoring position of a piston 12a, 14a, 16a or 18a within a fluid actuated cylinder 12b, 14b, 16b or 18b by radiating microwave energy into the actuator cylinder and measuring axial position of the piston as a function of microwave resonances and the frequencies at which such resonances occur. Separate microwave transmitting and receiving antenna probes 32, 36 are mounted on one end cap 34 of the actuator cylinder, which has a fixed diameter and an axial dimension which varies as a function of piston position. The transmitting probe 32 is coupled to an oscillator 46 which is controlled to sweep a predetermined frequency range for generating one or more TM01q resonant modes within the cylinder cavity. A threshold detector 72 and a peak detector 70 are coupled to the receiving probe 36 for detecting occurrence of cavity resonances. Latches 78 store oscillator control signals associated with occurrence of up to eight such resonance events, with the stored control signals thus being an indication of resonant frequencies. A CPU 56 includes a microprocessor 82 programmed to determine cavity length and piston position as a combined function of such resonant frequencies and the corresponding orders q of each frequency.
