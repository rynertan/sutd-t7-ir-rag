## Description
POLYOLEFIN POLYMERIZATION PROCESS AND CATALYST The present invention relates to the polymerization of olefins. In another aspect this invention relates to novel catalysts useful for the polymerization of olefins. EP A O Q60 443 discloses a number of new high activity polymerization catalysts. The disclosure of said application is hereby incorporated by reference. One of those catalyst types disclosed was prepared by reacting reactants comprising a a magnesium dihalide, b a benzoic acid ester, and c a titanium compound, such as an alkoxytitanium compound, to produce a first catalyst component, then reacting that component with a second catalyst component comprising a precipitating agent, and then reacting the resulting solid product with a halogenating agent, such as TiC14. The present application is directed to the discovery that the activity of such catalysts can also be improved by adding specified amounts of alkanol to the magnesium dihalide. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides an improved catalyst, the method of its production and the method for its use in polymerization of alpha olefins. The catalyst preparation involves reacting 1 a magnesium dihalide containing at least one alkanol, 2 a benzoic acid ester, and 3 an alkoxytitanium compound to form a first catalyst component, then reacting said first catalyst component with an organoaluminum halide to obtain a solid product, and then reacting the resulting solid product with a halogenating agent comprising a titanium halide. Detailed Description of the Invention The presently preferred magnesium dihalide is anhydrous magnesium di chloride. The term llanhydroustt magnesium chloride is conventionally used to indicate a magnesium dichloride containing no more than about I mole of water per mole of magnesium dichloride. The benefits provided by adding a alkanol to the magnesium chloride in accordance with the present invention are greatest when the magnesium dichloride contains less than about 0.5 mole of water per mole of magnesium dichloride and is substantially free of organic compounds.The level of water can be determined using routine analysis techniques.Typically, such techniques involve the use of Karl Fischer titration plus other conventional techniques such as X ray diffraction and elemental analysis for determining whether there are significant amounts of other materials, particularly MgO, associated with the MgC12. Alkanols that are considered to be suitable include the nontertiary aliphatic alcohols containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule, more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms per molecule, and most preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms per molecule. Specific examples of such alcohols include methanol, ethanol, l propanol, 2 propanol, l butanol, 2 butanol, 2 methyl 2 propanol, l pentanol, 3 methyl 1 butanol, l hexanol, 3 hexanol, l octanol, l dodecanol, and the like and mixtures thereof. Methanol is presently preferred for reasons of efficacy in producing active catalysts as well as for economy. The alkanol can be added in any amount which will provide an improvement in the productivity of the catalyst. Obviously, the exact amounts can vary depending upon the amount of water associated with the catalyst and the level of improvement desired. For methanol, generally the molar ratio of alcohol to magnesium dihalide is in the range of about 0.2 to about 1.5, more preferably about 0.5 to about 1.1. The alkoxytitanium compounds are those titanium compounds in which the titanium is bonded to at least one oxygen atom and the oxygen atom is bonded to at least one alkyl radical. The preferred alkoxytitanium compounds are those of the formula Ti OR 4 wherein each R is individually selected from an alkyl group containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms and each R can be the same or different. The most preferred are those in which each alkyl group contains 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The molar ratio of the alkoxytitanium compound to the metal halide compound can be selected over a relatively broad range.Generally, the molar ratio of alkoxytitanium to magnesium dihalide is in the range of about 10 1 to 1 10, more preferably about 2 1 to 1 2. The term benzoic acid ester is used generically to include substituted as well as unsubstituted benzoic acid esters. Typical examples include ethyl benzoate, ethyl p methoxybenzoate, ethyl toluate ethyl p butoxybenzoate, and butyl benzoate. The preferred benzoic acid esters are those having 8 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule. In an especially preferred embodiment, a phenol is employed in conjunction with the benzoic acid ester in making the first catalyst component. The term phenol is used herein to refer to substituted as well as unsubstituted phenols. Typical examples include phenol, o methyl phenol, m methyl phenol, p methyl phenol, 4 phenyl phenol, o fluorophenol, m fluorophenol, p fluorophenol, p sec butyl phenol, p ethyl phenol, p isopropyl phenol, p tertbutyl phenol, p methoxy phenol, p cyanophenol, and p nitrophenol. The currently preferred combination of ester and phenol is 4 phenyl phenol and ethyl benzoate. The total number of moles of 4 phenyl phenol and ethyl benzoate employed can affect the activity and selectivity of the resulting catalyst. Typically, the ratio of the sum of the moles of those two electron donors to the moles of the titanium alkoxide are in the range of about 5 1 to 1 5, more preferably 3 1 to 2 1. Most preferably 5 mole of ethyl benzoate is employed per mole of titanium alkoxide. The metal halide compound and the transition metal compound employed in the present invention are normally mixed together by heating, e.g., refluxing, in a suitable dry essential absence of water solvent or diluent, which is essentially inert to these components and the product produced. By the term inert is meant that the solvent does not chemically react with the dissolved components such as to interfere with the formation of the product or the stability of the product once it is formed. Such solvents or diluents include, for example, n pentane, n heptane, methylcyclohexane, toluene, xylenes and the like. It is emphasized that aromatic solvents are preferred, such as for example xylene because the solubility of the metal halide compound and the transition metal compound is higher in aromatic solvents as compared to aliphatic solvents, particularly at low temperatures.Such mixing temperatures are generally within the range of from about OOC to about 500C and preferably from about 100C to about 300C. Generally the amount of solvent or diluent employed can be selected over a broad range. Usually the amount of solvent or diluent is within the range of about 20 to about 100 cc per gram of metal dihalide. The temperature employed during the heating step can also be selected over a broad range. Normally the heating temperature is within the range of about l50C to about 1500C when the heating step is carried out at atmospheric pressure.Obviously, the heating temperatures employed could be higher if the pressure employed is above atmospheric pressure. The pressure employed during the heating step does not appear to be a significant parameter. Generally, the time required for heating the reactants to make the first catalyst component is within the range of about 5 minutes to about 10 hours, although in most instances a time within the range of about 15 minutes tb 3 hours is sufficient. The organoaluminum halide catalyst component is selected from compounds of the type having the formula AlRnX3n wherein eachR is individually selected from saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbyl radicals containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms per radical, X is a halogen, and n is any number such that 1 n 2. Typical examples include ethylaluminum dichloride, diethylaluminum chloride, and ethylaluminum sesquichloride. The latter compound is currently preferred. The reaction of the organoaluminum halide with the first catalyst component can be carried out by merely adding the organoaluminum halide to a solution of the first component. It is, however, currently preferred to add a hydrocarbon solution of the halide to the first component solution. The temperature employed for reacting the second catalyst component, i.e., the organoaluminum halide, and the first catalyst component can be selected over a broad range. Generally, the temperature employed is within a range of about OOC to about 5O0C or higher, while temperatures within the range of 200C to about 3O0C were most often employed. Since heat is evolved when the first catalyst component and the second catalyst component are mixed, the mixing rate is adjusteda s required and additional cooling is employed in order to maintain a relatively constant mixing temperature. It has been found preferable to add the second component to the first component.After completing the mixing, the resulting slurry is stirred or agitated for a sufficient time, generally within a range of about 15 minutes to about 5 hours to insure that mixing of the components is complete. Thereafter, stirring is discontinued and the solid product recovered by filtration, decantation, and the like. The product is then washed with a suitable material such as a hydrocarbon, e.g., n pentane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, xylenes and the like, to remove any soluble material which may be present. The product is then dried and stored under dry nitrogen. The molar ratio of the transition metal compound of the first catalyst component to the second catalyst component can be selected over a relatively broad range. Generally, the molar ratio of the transition metal of the first catalyst component to the second catalyst component is within a range of from about 10 1 to about 1 10 and more generally within a range of about 2 1 to about 1 3 since a molar ratio within the latter range usually produces a catalyst which can be employed as an especially active olefin polymerization catalyst. Generally, the reaction between solid product resulting from the reaction of the first and second components with the halide ion exchanging source can be carried out neat or in a liquid medium in which the halide ion exchanging source is soluble. The product from step 2 is generally in a liquid diluent when contacted with the halide ion exchanging source. Any suitable diluent can be employed. Examples include normally liquid hydrocarbons such as n pentane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, and xylene. The temperature employed in step 3 can be selected over a relatively broad range, generally in the range of 250C to 2500C, preferably OOC to 2000C, with temperatures of 1000C being most preferred. The treating time can also be selected over a broad range and generally is within the range of about 10 minutes to about 10 hours. While the weight ratio of the halide ion exchanging source to the product of step 2 can be selected over a relatively broad range, the weight ratio of the halide ion exchanging source to the product of step 2 is generally within a range of about 10 1 to about 1 10 and more generally from about 7 1 to about 1 4 Following the treatment of the product of step 2 with the halide ion exchanging source the surplus halide ion exchanging source is removed by washing the solid catalyst with a dry essential absence of water liquid such as a hydrocarbon of the type previously disclosed, n hexane, or xylene for example. The resulting catalyst, after drying, is stored under dry nitrogen. The currently preferred titanium halide for use as the halide ion exchanging source is TiCI4. In an especially preferred embodiment, the TiC14 is employed in conjunction with a halide of silicon such as EPIC13 or SiC14. Generally, ESiC13 and SiC14 are employed in such amounts that the sum of their volumes is about equal to the volume of the TiC14. Typically, the molar ratio of TiC14 to SiC14 would preferably be in the range of about 3 1 to about 4.5 1 and the molar ratio of HSiC13 to SiC14 in the range of about 2.5 1 to 4 1. The alkanol can be combined with the magnesium dihalide in any suitable manner. Typically the magnesium compound is just mixed with a hydrocarbon solution or dispersion of the alkanol. This generally results in a swelling of the magnesium compound which appears to go into solution more readily when combined with the titanium alkoxide. The catalyst of the present invention can be used in the polymerization of olefins. Olefins which can be homopolymerized or copolymerized with the invention catalysts include aliphatic mono 1 olefins. While the invention would appear to be suitable for use with any aliphatic mono 1 olefin, those olefins having 2 to 18 carbon atoms are most often used. The mono 1 olefins can be polymerized according to the present invention employing either a particle form process, a gas phase process, or a solution form process Aliphatic mono 1 olefins can be copolymerized with other 1 olefins and or with other smaller amounts of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, 1,3 pentadiene, styrene, alpha methylstyrene, and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not impair the catalyst. The catalysts of this invention can also be utilized to prepare homopolymers and copolymers of conjugated diolefins.Generally the conjugated diolefins contain 4 ta 8 carbon atoms per molecule. Examples of suitable conjugated diolefins include 1,3butadiene, isoprene, 2 methyl 1,3 butadiene, 1,3 pentadiene, and 1,3 octadiene. Suitable comonomers, besides the conjugated diolefins listed above include mono 1 olefins previously described and vinylaromatic compounds generally. Some suitable vinylaromatic compounds are those having from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms per molecule, and include for example styrene and various alkylstyrenes, such as 4 ethylstyrene and such as 1 vinylnaphthalene. The weight percent of the conjugated diolefin in the copolymerization mixture can be selected over a relatively broad range. Generally the weight percent of the conjugated diolefin is from about 10 to about 95 weight percent and the other comonomers are from about 90 to about 5 weight percent. However, the weight percent of the conjugated diolefin is preferably from about 50 to about 90 weight percent and the other comonomers are from about 50 to about 10 weight percent. The inventive catalysts are particularly well suited for producing stereoregular polypropylene, many offering potential for high rates as well as low soluble polymer formation. Polymerization may be conducted in a liquid phase, in the presence or absence of an inert hydrocarbon diluent, or in a gas phase. In the polymerization of propylene, particularly satisfactory results have been attained operating in the presence of an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon diluent, liquid under the polymerization conditions, such as propylene, toluene, gasoline, and the like. While it may not be necessary in all instances to employ a cocatalyst with the catalyst of the present invention, the use of cocatalysts is recommended for best results. The organometallic cocatalysts suitable for use in accordance with the invention can be selected from among the hydrides and organometallic compounds of metals of Groups IA, II, and IIIA of the Periodic Table.Of the organometallic cocatalysts, organoaluminum compounds such as those described above as suitable for use as the second component of the catalyst, are preferred with the most preferred organoaluminum cocatalysts being compounds of the formula R3Al which include, for example, trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisopropylaluminum, tridecylaluminum, trieicosylallminum, tricyclohexylaluminum, triphenylaluminum, 2 methylpentyldiethylalnn7inum, and triisoprenylaluminum. Triethylaluminum is preferred since this compound produced excellent results in the runs hereafter described. The molar ratio of the organometallic compound of the cocatalyst to the transition metal compound of the first catalyst component is not particularly critical and can be selected over a relatively broad range. Generally, the molar ratio of the organometallic compound of the cocatalyst to the transition metal compound of the first catalyst component is within a range of about 1 1 to about 1500 1. For catalyst systems wherein the cocatalyst comprises at least one organoaluminum compound typically there is employed about 0.25 to 15 milligrams of the titaniumocontaining component per mmole of organoaluminum cocatalyst. The catalyst is preferably used with a multicomponent cocatalyst system comprising triethylaluminum TEA , an aromatic ester such as ethyl anisate EA , ethyl benzoate EB , methyl ptoluate HPT , etc., and diethylaluminum chloride. Best selectivity stereospecificity is obtained when the TEA ester mole ratio is about 2 1. The DEAC, when used, helps in increasing activity.Generally, a TEA ester I EAC mole ratio ranging from about 2 1 0.5 3 and preferably about 2 1 2 is employed in bench scale testing for batch polymerization. For a continuous, larger scale process, it becomes possible, for example, when using TEA and MPT to use TEA MPT mole ratios of about 3 1 to about 5 1 and dispense with the DEAC entirely. A decreased DEAC level is desirable when employing a flash process to recover polymer since the amount of chloride remaining in the polymer is dependent to some extent on the DEAC level. The polymerization process according to the present invention employing the catalysts and cocatalysts as above described can be performed either batchwise or continuously. In a batch process, for example, a stirred autoclave is prepared by first purging with nitrogen and then with a suitable compound, such as isobutane for example. When the catalyst and cocatalyst are employed either can be charged to the reactor first or they can be charged simultaneously through an entry port under an isobutane purge. After closing the entry port, hydrogen, if used, is added, and then a diluent such as isobutane is added to the reactor.The reactor is heated to the desired reaction temperature, which for polymerizing ethylene, for example, is, for best results, generally within a range of about 500C to about 1200C and the monomer is then admitted and maintained at a partial pressure within a range of about 0.5 MPa to about 5.0MPa 70 725 psig for best results. At the end of the designated reaction period, the polymerization reaction is terminated and the unreacted olefin and isobutane are vented. The reactor is opened and the polymer, such as polyethylene, is collected as a freeflowing white solid and is dried to obtain the product. In a continuous process, for example, a suitable reactor such as a loop reactor is continuously charged with suitable quantities of solvent or diluent, catalyst, cocatalyst, polymerizable compounds and hydrogen, if any, and in any desirable order.The reactor product is continuously withdrawn and the polymer recovered as appropriate, generally by flashing the diluent solvent and unreacted monomers and drying the resulting polymer. For optimum productivity of polymer of low solubility in the continuous polymerization of propylene preferably the cocatalyst comprising the trialkylaluminum electron donor is contacted with the titanium containing catalyst prior to being exposed to liquid propylene. The olefin polymers made with the catalysts of this invention are useful in preparing articles by conventional polyolefin processing techniques such as injection molding, rotational molding, extrusion of film, and the like. A further understanding of the present invention and its advantages will be provided by the following examples. Example I All operations were conducted in a dry box containing an argon or nitrogen atmosphere or in containers containing such inert atmosphere unless indicatedsotherwise . A series of various MgC12.methanol adducts was prepared in separate one quart beverage bottles from mixtures containing 19.8 g 0.208 mole of particulate commercially obtained anhydrous MgCl2 shown by analysis for water content by the Karl Fischer method to contain about 0.5 weight percent water, thus giving an empirical formula of MgCl2.0.03 1120 , the specified quantities of reagent grade methanol and 150 mL of reagent grade mixed xylenes. Each mixture was stirred at about 230C for 15 hours.To each bottle was charged 25.0 g 0.147 mole of 4 phenylphenol, hereafter referred to as 4 PP, and 35.8 g 0.105 mole of titanium tetra n butoxide, hereafter referred to as Ti OBu 4. The stirred reaction mixtures were heated for 15 minutes at 1000C and to each was then added 7.89g 0.053 mole of ethyl benzoate, EB. Stirring and heating were thencontinued an additional 45 minutes at 100 C. Heating and stirring were discontinued and each reaction mixture was diluted with 500 mL of the xylene at about 250C. While stirring, each mixture was treated with 125 ml 0.099 mole of ethylaluminum sesquichloride, EASC, as a 25.4 weight percent solution of EASC in n heptane. The resulting precipitates I were isolated by suction filtration and a 20 g portion of each was treated with 720g of a mixture consisting of about 56 weight percent TiC14, 32 weight percent IsiCi3 and 12 weight percent SiC14. Each resulting product was isolated by suction filtration, washed repeatedly with portions of n hexane until the filtrate was essentially colorless and dried under an argon stream to obtain the catalyst II . A control catalyst produced with MgCl2 .0.05 H20 and no methanol was prepared as outlined above. The quantities of methanol employed, when used, and the results obtained are given in Table IA. Analyzed catalyst compositions, minus combined oxygen and hydrocarbon groups, is given in Table IB. In producing the catalyst, the respective mole ratios based on MgC12 as 1 were l.0 MgC12, 0.5 Ti OBu 4, 0.7 4 PP and 0.25 EB. The mole ratio of Ti OBu 4 to EASC was about 1.05 1.

A portion of each dry catalyst was employed in the production of polypropylene in a stirred, stainless steel liter reactor in one hour runs in liquid propylene under liquid full conditions at 700C in the presence of 10 psig hydrogen. The cocatalyst used in each run comprised 2.00 mmole of triethylaluminum 3.23 mL of 0.62 M TEA in n heptane , 1.10 mmole of ethyl anisate and 2.00 mmole of diethylaluminum chloride DEAC 3.36 ml of 0.596 M DEAC in n heptane . Each run was terminated after I hour and total polymer yield reactor solids plus propylenesoluble polymer was determined. Flexural modulus was determined in accordance with ASTM D790.

The results show that catalysts based on anhydrous HgCl2, e.g., MgC12 containing about 0.05 mole H2O or less per mole MgC12 or HgCl2.n CR3011 where n is greater than about 1.4 are about equivalent in performance based on productivity values, e.g. about 1.4 to 2.5 kg polymer per g catalyst per hour. However, when n is greater than zero and less than about 1.2, e.g.about 0.5 to 1, catalyst produced with such adducts shows an unexpected and substantial increase in productivity, e.g. about 3 to 5 fold better. Also, such invention catalysts produce polypropylene which is about 96 to 98 percent insoluble in xylene and which is quite suitable for film, fiber and the like. Example II Catalyst was prepared in a 30 gallon 113 L Pfaudler reactor under a nitrogen blanket. The reactor was charged at about 250C with 7.2 gal 27.2L of the mixed xylenes and 963.7 g 10.12 moles of commercially obtained MgC12 containing 1.4 weight percent water as determined by the Karl Fischer method, corresponding to the formula HgCl2. 0.08 H20. While stirring, a mixture of 360 mL of the xylenes and 360 mL 285 g, 8.90 moles of methanol was added over a 10 minute period and the resulting mixture was heated to 400 450C for 80 minutes. The calculated MgC12 to CH3011 mole ratio is about 1 0.9.The mixture was cooled to about 300C and then 1269.9 g 7.46 moles of 4 PP and 1723.7 g 5.06 moles of Ti OBu 4 was added with stirring. The mixture was heated to 900C 1000C for 15 minutes, 362.9 g 2.42 moles ofEB was added and the stirred mixture heated at that temperature for 45 minutes more. The reactor was then cooled to about 500C and over a 54 minute period, 10.4 ibs of 25.4 weight percent EASC in n heptane 4.90 moles EASC was added with stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred an additional 45 minutes and then cooled to about 3O0C. Five gal 18.9L of n hexane was added to the stirred mixture, then the mixture was allowed to settle.The mother liquor was decanted from the precipitate and the precipitate was washed 4 times with 15 gal 57 L portions of n hexane by stirring the mixture, allowing the solids to settle and decanting the wash liquor. The reactor was then charged with 31 lbs 14 kg of a mixture consisting of 54 weight percent TiC14, 14 weight percent SiC14 and 32 weight percent HSiC13. The reactor was heated for 1 hour at 900 1000C with stirring. The mixture was then cooled to about 300C, 5 gal of n hexane was added, mixed, the solids allowed to settle and the mother liquor decanted. The solids were washed 6 times with 15 gal portions of n hexane as above and the catalyst transferred to a receiver for storage as a slurry. The calculated mole ratios based on MgC12 as 1 are 1.0 HgCl2, 0.50 Ti OBu 4, 0.74 4 PP and 0.24 EB. A portion of the catalyst slurry was dried for analysis of the components and for use in testing polymerization of propylene. Analysis disclosed that the catalyst consisted of 2.0 weight percent Ti, 22.2 weight percent Mg, 62.8 weight percent C1 with the balance being combined oxygen and hydrocarbon groups and Si. Using the same general procedure described before, individual samples of the dry catalyst was employed in propylene polymerization for 1 hour at 700C in liquid propylene under liquid full conditions using a 1 gallon 3.77 L stainless steel stirred reactor. The cocatalyst system employed was TEA, as a 15 weight percent solution in n heptane premixed with the specified amount of methyl p toluate MET as about a 33 weight percent solution in n hexane, and when employed, DEAC as a 25 weight percent solution in n heptane. In each run, 7.54 mmoles of TEA was used, corresponding to 2 mmoles TEA per liter of reactor contents, e.g. 8.2 ml of the TEA solution per run.Each run was conducted in the presence of 30 delta psi hydrogen supplied from a pressurized 360 mL vessel, the hydrogen being charged after the cocatalyst system but before the reactor was charged with 3 L of liquid propylene. Each run began when the reactor temperature reached 700C and the reactor was liquid fullThe nominal reactor pressure at this time was about 615 psia.

Runs 7 14 conducted with catalyst sieved through 140 mesh screen. The results in Table II are representative of the range in values obtained with the Ti Mg catalyst of this invention using various cocatalyst systems. A presently preferred cocatalyst system is TEA MPT DEAC in the respective mole ratio of 2 1 2 with the concentration of TEA per liter of reactor contents normally being about 2 mmoles.Runs 6 and 7 are considered to be standard runs in this series, e.g.high catalyst productivity is coupled with low solubles and high flexural modulus. Active catalyst systems are obtained with other cocatalyst mole ratios as well. Runs 8 and 10 are illustrative of the effects of increasing the cocatalyst mole ratio of 2 1 2 to 3 1 3 and 4 1 4, while holding the TEA and DEAC mole ratios constant. Thus, catalyst total productivity increased from about 15 18 kg polymer per g catalyst per hour to about 27 32 kg polymer per g catalyst per hour.However, this is accompanied by increasing slightly the propylene and xylene soluble polymer produced which in turn slightly decreases the flexural modulus of the polymer. A goal is to obtain the highest possible flexural modulus values along with the best catalyst productivity possible. The effects of decreasing the cocatalyst mole ratio of 2 1 2 to 1.5 1 1.5 and to 1 1 1, while holding the TEA and DEAC concentrations constant, on catalyst productivity is shown in Runs 9 and 11. Thus, catalyst total productivity is decreased from about 15 18 kg polymer per g solid catalyst per hour to about 11.5 to about 5.4 kg polymer per g solid catalyst per hour, respectively. The effect of altering the mole ratio of DEAC in the cocatalyst system from zero to 1 while maintaining a constant 2 1 mole ratio of TEA MPT is shown in Runs 12, 13 and 14. Thus, as theDEAC mole ratio is decreased from 2 to 1 to 0.5 to zero, total catalyst productivity decreases. The decrease is slight at the 2 1 1 TEA MPT DEAC mole ratio with a slight increase in propylene and xylene solubles. However, when the DEAC mole ratio is lowered to 0.5, total catalyst productivity sharply decreases to about 10 kg polymer per g solid catalyst per hour. When no DEAC is employed as in Run 14, total catalyst productivity is again sharply decreased to about 3 kg polymer per g solid catalyst per hour.
