## Description
A LINEAR OR ROTARY TYPE OF ENGINE DRIVEN WITH AN AIR EXCHANGING CHAMBER MEANS AND AN ADVANCED IGNITION MEANSADJUSTABLE WITH SERVO DRIVE MEANS This invention relates to a linear or rotary type of engine provided with an air exchanging chamber means, and to an ignition advance means. The engine comprises one or more sets of cylinders arranged in a given phase relation, in a plane or arcuate surface which is in contact with a complementary and relatively slidable surface through a lubricating oil film. In said engine a set of cylinders comprises two rows of cylinders, one row of cylinders arranged in series providing the intake and compression strokes, while the other row of cylinders arranged in series provides the explosion and exhaust strokes. Said two rows of cylinders are arranged with the cylinders of one row alternating with the cylinders of the other row. w The cylinders are not overlapping but each cylinder of one row is connected across to an adjacent cylinder of the other row by means of an air exchanging chamber provided on the complementary sliding surface.The intake and compression cylinders and the explosion and exhaust cylinders may be provided in the surface of a part which moves relative to the engine while the air exchanging chambers may be provided in the complementary surface of a part which is fixed relative to the engine or vice versa. In line with the positions of said intake and compression cylinders, and the positions of said explosion and exhaust cylinders, a corresponding number of retractably sliding valves are provided in said complementary surface each valve being capable of projecting into a corresponding chamber and sealing the part of the chamber on one side of the valve from the part of the chamber on the other sida An appropriate ignition spark plug or oil injection nozzle is installed inside each air exchanging chamber, or explosion and exhaust cylinder, to initiate the combustion of fuel and so drive the moving part, i.e.to complete the Otto cycle comprising intake, compression, explosion and exhaust for the purpose of driving the corresponding planar or arcuate surface moving parts to generate a linear or rotary dynamic output.

This invention provides a linear or rotary type of engine for cyclic operation with separate intake and explosion cylinders connected by an air exchanging chamber. In addition to having the conventional engine components, such as fuel system, cooling system, lubrication system, and transmission system as shown inFigs. 1 and 1 S, this novel engine can generate dynamic output by means of linear type or rotary type drive, the feature of which is that said linear type or rotary type of engine is provided with cylinders formed in a sliding surface. In Figs. 1 and 1 1 is shown a rotary engine in which the sliding surfaces are between moving part rotor 1 and fixed part stator 2 . Cylinders A for intake and compression and cylinders B for explosion and exhaust are connectable by air exchanging chambers 3 provided with spark plugs or injection nozzles 4 . As shown in Fig. 2, said engine may be a type, in which either the inner part or the outer part is the rotor 1 , and the other part is the stator 2 The two parts may both be designed as coaxial cylinders as shown in Fig. 3 with their adjoining surfaces in close sliding contact. An oil film is present between the sliding surfaces to provide lubrication and a hermetic seal. On one of said surfaces, one or more than one cylinder sets arranged in a given phase relation are used to perform Otto cycle comprising intake, compression, explosion, and exhaust so as to drive the sliding part 1 either linearly or rotating. As shown in Fig. 4 in relation to a linear engine and in Fig. 5 in relation to a rotary engine the cylinder set of said sliding part 1 comprises two rows of cylinder A B , in which one row is the intake and compression cylinders A , while the other row is the explosion and exhaust cylinders B which may be equal or un equal to the length of the cylinder A . A sectional view of said cylinders A B is shown in the Figs. 4 and 5 with their phase relation as shown in the plan views of Fig. 4 and 5 in which the cylinders A B of the two rows are arranged alternately but not overlapped. The engines of Figs. 4 and 5 consist of a fixed part 2 and a sliding part 1 . In said sliding part 1 , a number of air exchanging chambers 3 each corresponding to a pair of cylinders A B in the two sets is provided across said cylinders A B . The air exchanging chambers 3 are so arranged as to connect the two cylinders A B of the pair during the completion of compression stroke prior to the explosion stroke so as to let the compressed and atomized fuel enter the explosion cylinder cylinder B as shown in Fig. 6. The span between every air exchanging chambers 3 is the same as that between the cylinders A and B . At a position inside the air exchanging chamber 3 and near said explosion and exhaust cylinder B , a spark plug or an oil nozzle 4 , depending on the fuel used, is installed in a recess in the fixed part 2 .In a gasoline engine, a spark plug 4 will be used, while an oil nozzle is used for the diesel engine. Further, in said fixed part 2 , a movable valve at , an intake port A2 , a movable valve 31 , and an exhaust port B2 are provided opposite to the cylinder A and cylinder B respectively as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 Said movable valve Al and intake port A2 are located after the air exchanging chamber 3 in the direction of movement of the moving part 1 and in the line of passage of the cylinder A row. The movable valve A1 slides in a slot in fixed part 2 and is provided with a spring 5 , by which the outer end of the valve is pressed into close contact with the bottom and the side surface of said cylinder A .The sliding valve Al may be aligned at right angles or at a suitable other angle to the sliding part 1 . When the sliding part 1 is in motion, air will be sucked into the compression cylinder A through intake port A2 . The movable valve B1 and the exhaust port B2 are located forward of the air exchange chamber 3 in the direction of movement of the moving part 1 and in the line of passage of the cylinder B row. The valves B1 are sliding valves similar to valves A1 and are pressed by a spring 5 into close contact with the bottom and side surface of the related explosion and exhaust cylinder B at a right angle or other suitable angle. The movable valves Al, B1 when extended into the respective cylinders seal that part of the cylinder on one side of the valve from that part of the cylinder on the other side of the valve. In this way, for example, they block the waste gas in explosion stroke in the cylinder B and exhaust it through exhaust port B2 during the motion of the sliding part 1 . Referring to Fig. 7 when the sliding part 1 is driven by a starting motor or other means to slide or rotate to a direction indicated by the arrow, the cylinder A will first receive the movable valve A1 . There is also a movable valve Al between two cylinders A but that one is restricted into the fixed part 2 .As cylinder A slides along, the space thereof that has slid over said movable valve Al is under low pressure and sucks air and fuel through the intake port A2 .As the cylinder A continues moving forwards, the air and fuel in that part of the cylinder A on the other side of the movable valve Al will be compressed. At the same time, movable valve B1 will slide into cylinder B . Now the air and fuel cylinder A will be compressed through the air exchanging chamber 3 , into cylinder B under high pressure. As the sliding part 1 continuously moves forwards the air exchanging chamber 3 becomes disconnected from the intake and compression cylinder A , and the spark plug 5 near the cylinder B will ignite the air fuel mixture the sliding part 1 continues to move forward being driven by means of the arcuate or oblique surface design at the leading end of the cylinder B .The movable valve B1 blocks off the waste gas generated during the preceding explosion in cylinder B and exhausts it through exhaust port B2 . After the sliding part 1 , being driven by the preceding compressed fuel explosion, reaches the aforesaid movable valve Al to cause said valve to retract into the fixed part 2 , said cylinder A starts the next cycle letting the movable valve Al slide in so as to have cylinder A suck air fuel mixture into that part forward of the movable valve at , and to compress on the other side of movable valve A1 the fuel air sucked into the cylinder A during the preceding cycle.As before, the air fuel mixture is passed into cylinder B through the air exchanging chamber 3 then, the spark plug 4 inside the air exchanging chamber 3 will ignite the air fuel mixture for continuously driving the sliding part 1 . The sets of cylinders may be staggered to provide a more continuous driving force. The aforesaid engine may be driven with diesel oil or other fuel by using oil nozzle instead of spark plug 4 and by suitable changing the compression ratio. When the sliding part 1 is moving, air will be sucked into the compression cylinder A via the intake port A2 . The air in said cylinder A will be compressed into the air exchanging chamber 3 and the cylinder B by means of the movable valve A1 in next cycle. When the sliding part 1 has continued to move forwards to separate the air exchanging chamber 3 from the cylinder A , the air in the cylinder B has been compressed to a high pressure and temperature. At that moment, oil or other gas fuel is sprayed through a nozzle into the cylinder B to be exploded by the high pressure and high temperature and so continuously drive the sliding part 1 . Further, exhausting of the exhaust gases can be carried out by another method of direct exhausting in next cycle the structure arrangement for this method is shown in Fig. 8. At the trailing end of the explosion and exhaust cylinder B , and at an angle to the direction motion a laterally extending slot 5 is provided. On the opposed sliding surface, an exhaust passage 6 is provided on the corresponding line of motion of the slot 5 . During the final phase of explosion stroke, the engine is connected to said laterally extended slot 5 to exhaust the waste gas. The movable valve B1 of the engine of this invention may be of one piece construction, or it may be provided with a spring loaded head piece 12 of suitable friction resistant metal or alloy for contact with the cylinder walls, as shown in Fig. 13. Alternatively the head of the valve may be enlarged to present an arcuate face to the wall of the cylinder A B as shown in Fig. 9. Also as shown in Fig. 9 the line of movement of the valve may be normal to, or inclined to, the line of movement of part 1 . The movable valve Al may be arranged near the air exchanging chamber 3 as shown in Fig. 8 and 9. The movable valve A1 may be installed at the leading side of the air exchanging chamber 3 with respect to. the direction of movement of part 1 and on the compression cylinder A so as to have the gas fuel or the compressed air in cylinder A completely 100 compressed into the cylinder B of the air exchanging chamber 3 upon movement of the sliding part 1 . The movable valve B1 may be installed near the trailing side of the air exchanging chamber 3 . The dynamic output of this invention may be trans mitted by means of the movable valve A1 or Bi pivotally connected to the connecting rod C , and then by means of the cylinder set A B arranged in a selected phase relation to generate an Otto cycle for driving a crank D to provide conventional dynamic output. The outer ring may be a sliding part 1 , and the inner ring may be a fixed part 2 . By means of a suitable number of cylinder sets A B arranged in a slected phase relation, the dynamic output movable valves Al B1 may be arranged in a vertical type, a V shaped type, or lateral type to drive the crank D through connecting rods C as shown in Fig. 10, 11, and 12. Said inner ring may be a sliding part 1 , and said outer ring may be a fixed part 2 .The cylinder sets A B may be arranged in a selected phase relation to have the movable valves A1 B1 of each cylinder set in a vertical type arrangement so as to drive one or more sets of cranks D in different phase arrangement for a multi shaft dynamic output as shown in Fig. 14. Further, referring to Fig. 15, in a linear type engine of this invention in which a sliding part 1 , is driven, the movable valves A1 B1 reciprocatingly sliding inside the fixed part 2 may directly or indirectly drive and control other auxiliary means. In the aforesaid means that uses said movable valve Al B1 as a driving media, a sliding packing or head piece 1t loaded by a spring 13 , or other packing piece, may be used for keeping said movable valves Al B1 and the cylinder bottom in close contact with each other during sliding so as to make sure the gas is being effectively compressed as shown in Fig. 13. In a conventional engine, advancement of ignition during high speed running is done by means of centrifugal block and vacuum advance mechanisms. However, when engine speed is increased, the frequency of ignition and explosion is increased in a functional diagram manner, while the advanced ignition effect is increased in linear nature, i.e. the ignition means is unable to correctly match the higher explosion frequency. As a result, the maximum running speed of a conventional engine is liable to be limited by the drift effect of the ignition means, and therefore its efficiency is lowered. The servo driven adjustment advanced ignition means in this invention can reduce this disadvantage of the known centrifugal block and vacuum advance mechanisms by perfectly compensating and matching the linear variation of advancement of ignition in the engine.The structure of said new ignition means is shown in Figs. 16 and 17, in which a The sensing means 14 at the intake is a known means that can convert the vacuum into a corresponding analog signal or digital signal. b The engine speed sensing means 15 is a known means that can convert the rotational speed into an analog or digital signal. c Storage means 16 stores the best correction values it contains the best ignition advance data required by the engine stored in analog or digital form. d Processing control means 17 is an analog comparator circuit or a digital CPU, which, when fed with the inputs from said sensing means 14 of intake vacuum and said engine speed sensing means 15 , and by reference to the best data from the storage means 16 of the best correction value can generate a servo driving signal. e Driving circuit 18 is an analog amplifier circuit which, by means of the driving signal of said processing control means, generates a corresponding voltage or current output, or a circuit 19 which can convert the digital pulse signal of said processing control means into a direction or quantity driving signal to a stepper motor. f An analog type of servo driving adjustment of ignition advance means is a linear solenoid 20 with return spring which can be driven with the analog signal of said driving circuit 18 so as to pull the movable part of the contact point seat 21 for adjusting the ignition time as shown in Fig. 18 the adjustment may also be done by means of a rotary solenoid with return spring being directly coupled to the movable contact point seat, or by means of a driving means being coupled to the movable contact point seat to receive the driving output from the aforesaid driving circuit. g A stepper type of servo driving adjustment advanced ignition means The ignition time may be adjusted by means of a stepper motor 22 directly coupled to the movable contact point seat 23 , or by means of a transmission means coupling 24 to the movable contact point as shown in Fig. 19 so as to be driven by the drive circuit. h A solid state time delay type of ignition advance means uses an electronic ignition means, of which the timing ignition reference circuit is furnished by the aforesaid analog or digital signal circuit so as to timely vary the input time of the ignition instruction signal for changing the ignition output time as shown in Fig.20. In Fig. 20 the ignition instruction input means is a photocell or an inductive non contact type 25 , or electric mechanical contact type ignition means being in synchronization with the engine said ignition means can provide an ignition signal being slightly earlier than the timing ignition to be delivered into a controllable timedelay circuit 26 to trigger said solid state ignition means 27 . Said controllable time delay circuit is an analog comparator delay circuit made of a known linear IC and a time delay circuit, or may be a digital circuit comprising a micro computer said circuit not only can receive the timing ignition signal, but also can receive the analog or digital signal from the aforesaid processing control means 4 . Upon the advanced ignition signal from 4 being delivered to the aforesaid time delay circuit, the operation of said circuit is to shorten the delay time as shown in Fig. 21. In Fig. 17 the output signals from the sensing means 14 and 15 are fed into a function generator 40 to produce a final output signal to control ignition timing. By means of the circuit shown by way of example inFig.l7, signals a and b from sensing means 14 and 15 respectively are converted into a final signal represented by the formula k3 Uklf b k2a k4 b where kl, k2, and k3 are constants and f is a function determined by the electrical characteristics of the circuit.
