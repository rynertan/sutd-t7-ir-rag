# Optical disk player.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an optical disk recording and reproducing apparatus for recording a predetermined signal on and or reproducing the same from a writable disk 51 which is rotated at the constant linear velocity by using the laser from a laser source LD . In this case, upon reproducing the above described signal, if a signal recorded on the inner periphery of the disk 51 is accessed, during the period from this addressing up to the time when the linear velocity at the inner periphery of the disk 51 becomes constant, on the basis of a spindle lock signal, the beam amount of the laser from the laser source LD and irradiating the disk 51 is decreased to thereby prevent useless data from being rewritten in the disk 51 .
