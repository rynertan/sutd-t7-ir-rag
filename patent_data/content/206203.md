## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a quadrature differential phase shift keying system, more particularly to an offset quadrature differential phase shift keying modulator demodulator adapted for transmitting and receiving information via a non linear channel, and further to an information recording and reproducing apparatus using such modulator demodulator. In the field of digital radio communication, a quadrature differential phase shift keying QDPSK system is widely employed today due to some advantages including the capability of relatively narrow band transmission and the simplified structure of a demodulator. In such QDPSK system, however, passage of information through a nonlinear channel causes an increase in the bandwidth and deteriorates the coding error rate characteristic. These disadvantages raise a serious problem to be solved in a transmitter for satellite communication, inobile communication or the like where the bandwidth is limited and the carrier to noise power ratio C N is not settable to be so high. In view of the circumstances mentioned above, an offset QPSK system is attracting attention of late. This system is dealt with in the following H. Suzuki et al. Fundamental Properties of Narrowband Digital AngleModulations , Shingaku Giho, CS 81 52, 1981 and R. K.Kwan, The Effects of Filtering and Limiting A DoubleBinary PSK Signal , IEEE Trans. on AES, July 1969.According to this system, data of an in phase P channel and a quadrature Q channel are modulated in such a manner that the code change points thereof have a mutual deviation of one half data period, wherein the envelopes of the modulated waves are rendered free from zerocrossing, and the band is not so widened with passage of the data via the non linear channel. However, it is impossible in such offset QPSK system to use differential coding and decoding employed customarily in the known QPSK system, so that detection of the absolute phase has been necessary on the demodulator side heretofore. SUMMARY OF EE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an offset quadrature differential PSK modulator demodulator adapted for transmission of digital information. Another object of the invention resides in providing an offset quadrature differential PSK modulator demodulator adapted for recording and reproducing digital information. And a further object of the invention is to provide an information recording and reproducing apparatus equipped with an offset quadrature differential PSK modulator demodulator adapted for recording and reproducing digital information. In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention is so contrived that on its modulator side, data of the in phase channel and the quadrature channel are modulated after differential coding with the respective code change points being deviated from each other by one half data period, while on its demodulator side, the detected data are converted into serial data after differential decoding in the in phase and quadrature channels. In the present invention, the offset quadrature differential PSK modulator comprises a first converter for converting the input serial digital data into first and second signals which correspond respectively to the even and odd bits of the serial digital data with the code change points thereof having a mutual deviation of one half data period first and second differential coders for differentially coding the first and second signals respectively and a quadrature modulator for balanced modulating two quadrature carriers having a tor 2 phase difference from each other by the outputs of the first and second differential coders. Meanwhile, the offset quadrature differentialPSK demodulator in the present invention comprises a coherent detector for receiving the signal transmitted from the aforesaid offset quadrature differential PSK modulator and phase detecting the received signal with two quadrature carriers having a w 2 phase difference from each other first and second code discriminators for discrimianting between positive and negative polarities of the first and second output signals from the coherent detector, and converting such signals into first and second digital signals respectively first and second differential decoders for differentially decoding the first and second digital signals respectively and a second converter for alternately selecting the output signals of the first and second differential decoders at a speed twice the data speed of such output signals and converting them into serial signals. The present invention further provides a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus which is capable of magnetically recording video signal and digital audio signal, wherein the aforesaid offset quadrature differential PSK modulator is used as a modulation means in the digital audio recording line, while the aforesaid offset quadrature differential PSK demodulator is used as a demodulation means in the digital audio reproducing line. In another magnetic recording reproducing apparatus of the invention, a limiter circuit or a combination of a limiter circuit and a band pass filter is disposed in a stage posterior to the aforesaid offset quadrature differential PSK modulator in the digital audio recording line. The differential coding executed by the first and second differential coders constituting the offset quadrature differential PSK modulator is preferably such as to satisfy the conditions of Eqs. 1 and 2 which will be described later in detail. And similarly the differential decoding executed by the offset quadrature differential PSK demodulator is preferably such as to satisfy the conditions of Eqs. 6 and 7 or Eqs. 8 and 9 which will also be described later in detail. The above mentioned magnetic recording reproducing apparatus for multiply recording video signal and digital audio signal is defined as a multilayer recording and reproducing type which is capable of recording the video signal in a surface part of a magnetic recording medium while recording the digital audio signal in a deep part thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Figs. IA and 1B are respective circuit diagrams of a modulator and a demodulator for offset quadrature differential PSK embodying the present invention. First in Fig. 1A, there are shown an input terminal 1 for digital data A to be transmitted a serial parallel converter circuit 2 for converting the input serial data A into parallel data B and C of two systems differential coders 3a and 3b for converting the codes of parallel data B and C into coded changes a quadrature modulator 4 for balance modulating, by two carriers having a w 2 phase difference from each other, the parallel data D and E differentially coded independently of each other and an output terminal 40 for the modulated signal. In the above, the differential coder 3a comprises an EOR circuit 31a and a delay circuit 32a, while the differential coder 3b comprises an EOR circuit 31b and a delay circuit 32b.And the quadrature modulator 4 comprises balanced modulators 41a and 41b, a carrier oscillator 42, a w 2 phase shifter 43 and an adder 44. Thus the component elements mentioned constitute an offset quadrature differential PSK O QDPSK modulator. In Fig. 1B are shown an input terminal 50 for the O QDPSK modulated signal a coherent detector 5 for phase detecting the input modulated signal by two quadrature carriers phase locked to the modulated signal code discriminators 6a and 6b for discriminating between the positive and negagive polarities of the phase detected input signals of two systems by the timing synchronized with the speed of the parallel data transmitted thereto, and converting the input signals to digital signals differential decoders 7a and 7b for inversely converting the respective coded changes of the digital signals F and G of two systems to the former codes thereof a parallel serial converter 8 for converting the decoded parallel data H and I to serial data J and an output terminal 9 for the finally demodulated digital data J .The coherent detector 5 comprises phase detectors 51a and 51b, a carrier recovery circuit 52, a it 2 phase shifter 53 and low pass filters 55a and 55b.And the differential decoder 7a comprises an EOR circuit 71a and a delay circuit 72a, while the differential decoder 7b comprises an EOR circuit 71b and a delay circuit 72b. Thus the component elements mentioned constitute an O QDPSK demodulator. Fig. 2 is a waveform chart illustrating the operations performed in individual portions of the circuit shown in Fig. I. Hereinafter the operation of this embodiment will be described below with reference thereto. In Fig. 2, Cil shows operation waveforms on the modulator side, while iil and iii3 show those on the demodulator side. The waveforms of will represent a case where the phase difference of the carrier recovered in the demodulator is 0 or 1800 with respect to the carrier phase in the modulator, and those of tiii represent another case where the above phase difference is 900.First on the modulator side in ti , the input digital data A is divided into 2 bit groups each consisting of a preceding bit Xk and a following bit Yk in which k is an integer , and the parallel data B and C converted by the serialparallel converter 2 are outputted alternately with a mutual deviation of one half data period T 2 as shown.Subsequently the parallel data Xk and Yk are converted into data Pk and Qk by the differential coders 3a and 3b respectively, as given below by logical expressions Pk Xk O Pk 1 ....... 1 Qk Yk Qk 1 ....... 2 where 3 means exclusive ORed. The data Pk and Qk thus obtained are modulated by the quadrature modulator 4. The modulated signals are expressed as Eq. 3 below when the in phase carrierCP is cos xct and the quadrature carrier CQ is sin wct in which we is the carrier angular frequency . Pk cos ct Qk sin ct ...... 3 Subsequently, on the demodulator side, the modulated signal given by Eq. 3 is detected by the coherent detector 5. In this stage, the detected output signals are expressed as follows when the in phase carrier CP and the quadrature carrier CQ recorded by the circuit 52 are cos ct f and sin ct , respectively. Pk cos Qk sin 4 Pk sin Qk cos 5 During the normal operation of the carrier recovery circuit 52, the phase difference as compared with the modulator side is a value of 0 , 90 or it800. Fig. 2 ii shows the operation waveforms in a case where such phase difference is 0 or 180 . For example, when the phase difference is 0 , data Pk and Qk appear in the output signals F and G of the code discriminators 6a and 6b. Then such data are processed by the differential decoders 7a and 7b, so that the former parallel data Xk and Yk are decoded in the output signals H and I respectively.This process is expressed by logical equations as follows Pk Pk 1 Xk Q3 Pk 1 63 Pk 1 Xk ... 6 Qk O Qk 1 Yk Q3 Qk 1 O Qk 1 Yk ... 7 When the phase difference is 180 , data Pk andQk appear in the signals F and G as is obvious fromEqs. 4 and 5 , but the former data Xk and Yk are decoded in the signals H and I by the differential decoders 7a and 7b.The above is expressed by the following logical equations ri Pk 10 Pk 1 Xk ........ 8 0 o . 1 Yk Q9 Qk 1 Pk 1 Yk Qk 1 Qk 1 Yk ........ 9 The former parallel data Xk and Yk thus resumed are converted into serial data by the parallel serial converter 8 to obtain final demodulated data J . Similarly to the above, when the phase difference is 90 , merely the channels relative to Xk and Yk are reversed as shown in Fig. 2 iii while the sequential relationship between Xk and Yk is maintained, so that no problem is raised by executing parallel serial conversion of the data in such order. This method will be described later in detail. Fig. 3 is an exemplary circuit diagram of the modulator according to the present invention. In this embodiment are shown D type flip flops D FF 21, 22a, 22b, 33a, 33b, and an input terminal 10 for clock pulsesCK1 of the input data A . Fig. 4 is a waveform chart showing individual operations performed in the circuit of Fig. 3. Hereinafter such operations will be described with reference to Fig. 4. The clock pulses CK1 fed to the input terminal 10 are frequency divided by two in theD FF 21 to produce clock pulses CK2 and CZZ. The input serial data A is latched by the D FF 22a and 22b synchronously with the rising edges of the clock pulsesCK2 and C K2, whereby parallel data Xi and Yi are obtained.In the differential coders 3a and 3b, D FF 33a and 33b are employed to constitute the delay circuits 32a and 32b shown in the embodiment of Fig. 1, and the operations thereof remain exactly the same. In the circuit configuration of Fig. 3, Pk and Qk are outputted with a delay of one period from Xk and Yk respectively as shown inFig. 4, but there arises no problem at all. The parallel data Pk and Qk thus coded differentially are modulated by the quadrature modulator 4. According to this embodiment, in the manner mentioned above, the O QDPSK modulator can be realized with a simplified constitution. Fig. 5 is an exemplary circuit diagram of the demodulator according to the present invention. In this embodiment are shown comparators 61a and 61b D FF 62a, 62b, 64, 73a, 73b and 83 a clock recovery circuit 63 inverter circuits 65 and 66 AND circuits 81a and 81b an OR circuit 82 and an output terminal 90 for lock pulses CK1t bit synchronized with the demodulated data J . The signals of two systems detected by the coherent detector 5 are converted into digital signals F and G by the code discriminators 6a and 6b which are composed respectively of comparators 61a, 61b and D FF 62a, 62b.Such conversion is executed synchronously with the rising edges of clock pulses CK2 and CK which are obtained from the D FF 64 through 1 2 frequency division of the clock pulses CK1 recovered by the clock recovery circuit 63. The differential decoders 7a and 7b are so constituted that the aforesaid delay circuits 72a and 72b in the embodiment of Fig. 1 are replaced with D FF 73a and 73b, and the operations thereof remain exactly the same. The decoded parallel data H and J and the recovered clock pulses CK2 and CK2 are inputted respectively to the AND circuits 81a and 81b, from which AND outputs are produced.The two signals L and M are fed to the OR circuit 82 to be logically summed and then are latched by the D FF 83 synchronously with the rising edges of the recovered clock pulses CK1 , whereby demodulated serial data is finally obtained. Fig. 6 is a waveform chart showing how such operations are performed, in which i represents a case where the phase difference of the recovered carrier is 0 or l80C , and ii represents another case where the above phase difference is i900. Thus, regardless of the value of such phase difference , the transmitted data can be demodulated without any error. The differential procedure is applicable also to the O QPSK system which is advantageous with respect to the non linear transmission path, so that it becomes unnecessary to detect the absolute phase or to maintain the phase difference of the recovered carrier at 0 under control, thereby achieving great effects in simplifying the demodulator circuit configuration. Now, with reference to Fig. 7, a description will be given on another embodiment where the O QDPSK system of this invention is applied to a PCM audio magnetic multilayer recording reproducing apparatus.In the diagram are shown a video input terminal 101 a low pass filter LPF 110 for separating a luminance signal a frequency modulator Ill for modulating the luminance signal a band pass filter BPF 112 for separating a chrominance signal a frequency converter 113 for converting the chrominance signal to a lower frequency an adder 114 for adding the frequencymodulated luminance signal and the frequency converted chrominance signal to each other a recording lamp 115 video signal recording reproducing heads 116a and 116b an audio signal input terminal 102 an A D converter 120 a digital processing circuit 121 an offset quadrature differential phase shift keying O QDPSK modulator 122 a band pass filter BPF 123 a limiter 124 a recording amplifier 125 audio only recording reproducing heads 126a and 126b a reproducing amplifier 130 a band pass filter BPF 131 for separating the luminance signal a frequency modulator 132 a low pass filter LPF 133 for separating the chrominance signal a frequency converter 134 an adder 135 for adding the luminance signal and the chrominance signal to each other a video signal output terminal 103 a reproducing amplifier 140 a band pass filter BPF 141 for separating the audio signal an O QDPSK demodulator 142 of the present invention a digital processing circuit 143 aD A converter 144 and an audio signal output terminal 104. The O QDPSK modulator 122 and the O QDPSK demodulator 142 may be formed by using the circuit configurations shown in Figs. 3 and 5, respectively. In the above constitution, the operation is performed in the following manner. The video signal passed through the LPF 110 and the BPF 112 is separated into the luminance signal and the chrominance signal, which are then frequency modulaLed and frequencyconverted to the bands of Fig. 8 respectively by the frequency modulator 111 and the frequency converter 113.The signals thus processed are recorded on a tape by the two video recording heads 116a and 116b disposed opposite to each other. And in a playback mode, the signal reproduced by the heads 116a and 116b is passed through the BPF 131 and LPF 133 for separation of the luminance signal and the chrominance signal, which are then processed through the frequency demodulator 132 and the frequency converter 134 respectively, so that the signals are reconverted into the former video frequency band prior to the recording mode and subsequently are fed to the adder 135 from which the original video signal is resumed. Meanwhile, the audio signal is once converted into a digital form by the A D converter 120, and a synchronous signal and a correction code are added thereto by the digital processing circuit 121. After interleaving, the digital audio signal is inputted to the O QDPSK modulator 122, where O QDPSK modulation is performed in such a manner that, as shown in Fig. 8, the spectrum of the audio signal is defined within the occupied bandwidth of the frequency converted chrominance signal and that of the frequency modulated luminance signal in the entire spectrum of the signal to be recorded.TheO QDPSK modulated signal is then passed through the BPF 123 and the limiter 124 so that both the bandwidth and the amplitude are limited, and subsequently the signal is recorded, prior to video recording, on a video track by means of the audio only heads 126a and 126b which are different in azimuth angle from the video heads 116a and 116b. The O QDPSK modulated signal thus recorded is erased in the surface part of the tape by the video signal which is recorded later, whereby a multilayer magnetic recording mode is carried out with the firstrecorded audio signal remaining in the deep part of the tape. In a playback mode, the signal reproduced by the audio only heads 126a and 126b is passed through theBPF 141, from which the modulated audio signal is obtained. This signal is then fed to the O QDPSK demodulator 142 and the digital processing circuit 143 to resume the former digital signal, which is further fed to the D A converter 144 to restore the original audio signal. By recording the audio signal after conversion into a digital form as mentioned above, it is rendered possible to attain high quality audio transmission without harmful influence of any distortion in the recording medium. Furthermore, since the digital signal is recorded through O QDPSK modulation with limitation of both the bandwidth and the amplitude thereof, it becomes possible to minimize the interference with the video signal while enhancing the C N ratio of the reproduced O QDPSK modulated signal. Hereinafter the effects of the above embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 9 through 11.Fig. 9 graphically shows the result of actually measuring the recording current and the reproduced output level in the characteristics of the audio only heads 126a and 126b. Generally the magnetic head has such characteristic that, as plotted in the graph, its reproduced output increases in proportion to the recording current up to a certain level, but there exists a saturation point where the output level no further rises despite any increase of the recording current. And it is customary that the recording current is set at such saturation point for the purpose of improving the S N ratio. However, a possibility may be induced due to the saturation that the recorded waveform is distorted to eventually generate an unnecessary spectrum which brings about interference with the video signal.Particularly in applying the QPSK system which is utilized as digital modulation in a variety of fields and is substantially equivalent to an amplitude modulation AM system, a side lobe comes to expand due to the saturation. In view of such disadvantage, employing the O QPSK system is effective to minimize the amplitude variation in the recorded waveform to consequently suppress generation of any distortion that results from the saturation. And by virtue of the above described O QDPSK system, it is not needed to maintain the phase difference f of the recovered carrier at 0 under control, hence simplifying the demodulator circuit configuration. For recording the PCM audio signal on a multilayer medium without changing the frequency arrangement of the video signal used in the VTR available today, it is preferred to employ the technique of audio deep part recording. In a deep part recording operation where thePCM audio signal is erased in the surface part of the recording medium by the video signal superposed thereon, it is necessary to raise the reproduction level of thePCM audio signal as high as possible to achieve saturation recording. As the signal is saturated in such recording and its waveform is thereby distorted, theO QPSK system is preferred for modulation.Since in theO QPSK system some obscurity of nx 900 n integer is residual in the recovered reference carrier as mentioned, differential coding is executed on the transmitter side while inverse differential decoding is executed on the receiver side so as to attain exact demodulation despite such obscurity. The above is the feature of the O QDPSK system which is adapted to provide an optimal modulator demodulator. Figs. 10 and 11 show the effects of the abovementioned embodiment, in which Fig. 10 A and B represent the envelope of O Q D PSK modulated waves and that of QPSK modulated waves, respectively. In the O Q D PSK system, the amplitude variation is reduced as compared with the QPSK system. And saturation of such waveform is equivalent to clipping thereof at a certain level denoted by a one dot chain line. Fig. 11 graphically shows the spectra obtained in such a state, wherein a solid line and a broken line respectively denote the spectrum in the O Q D PSK system and that in the QPSK system. And a two dot chain line denotes the spectrum obtained at the time of nonsaturation without clipping. In this case, the spectrum is the same in both systems.As described, the O Q D PSK system is advantageous with respect to that the spectrum is kept free from expansion regardless of such clipping, and consequently interference with the video signal is substantially nil in recording the digital audio signal by the use of this system. In view of the fact that the spectrum is not expanded despite clipping of the aforementioned O Q D PSK modulated signal, the embodiment of Fig. 7 is so contrived as to perform a recording operation with a constant amplitude through the limiter 123 to limit the amplitude variation residual in the O Q D PSK modulated signal, hence accomplishing complete saturation recording to eventually improve the C N ratio of the reproduced signal as well as to reduce the coding error rate relative to the demodulated data. Fig. 12 graphically shows exemplary frequency characteristic of the BPF 123 in the digital audio signal recording circuit shown in Fig. 7. Assuming now that the converted digital audio signal is processed at a code transmission rate of 2M bits sec, the minimum necessary bandwidth is 500 kHz in QDPSK modulation. In such a case, if the bandwidth of the BPF 123 is set at 500 kHz to completely eliminate the side lobe of the modulated signal spectrum, then substantially no interference is generated with the video signal. Fig. 13 is an exemplary circuit diagram of the limiter 124, wherein an input signal fed to an input terminal 180 is passed through a resistor 181 and diodes 182 and 183, so that the signal amplitude is limited to the threshold voltage about 0.7 V of the diodes in both positive and negative polarities, and the signal thus limited is obtained from an output terminal 184. Fig.14 is another exemplary circuit diagram of the limiter 124, wherein a differential amplifier comprising transistors 185 and 186 is employed to attain the limiter effect.Although a variety of circuit configurations may be contrived with respect to the limiter 124 as mentioned, it is not limited to the above examples alone. In the aforesaid embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 7, the BPF 123 and the limiter 124 are disposed posterior to the O QDPSK modulator 122.However, substantially the same effect as in the above embodiment can be achieved even with omission of the limiter 124 and or the BPF 123. As described hereinabove, a multilayer recording operation is performed in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, wherein the video signal is composed of a frequency modulated luminance signal and a frequencyconverted chrominance signal, and superposition recording is executed by video and audio heads which are different in azimuth angle from each other. However, the feature of the above embodiment resides in extremely narrowing the occupied bandwidth of the digital audio recording signal to suppress the mutual interference with the video recording signal. Therefore, the recording mode is not restricted to such multilayer recording alone and may be ordinary multifrequency recording as well. Furthermore, in case the video signal is processed by a time division multiplex method with regard to its luminance and chrominance signals, multifrequency recording may be executed by selectively setting the occupied band of the digital audio recording signal outside that of the frequency modulated video signal. In another case of parallel recording the luminance signal and the chrominance signal in individual tracks, the digital audio signal may be multifrequency recorded in either of such tracks in a manner that the respective occupied bands are not overlapped.
