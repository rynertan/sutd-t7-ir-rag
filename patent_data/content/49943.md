# Movable magnetic head block assembly for a double sided flexible disk storage device.

## Abstract
A pair of mutally opposed disk contacting surfaces 39, 69 , at least one of which comprises an electromagnetic transducer head 40, 70 , are in contact under pressure with the opposite sides of a magnetic disk 2 so that information can be recorded or retrieved from the disk. To enable the unimpeded exchange of disks, an arrangement is provided whereby at least one of the disk contacting surfaces is mounted on an individual flexibly mounted retractable support arm 22, 52 which is normally urged under pressure against a stop, 36, 66 in the direction of the disk 2 to place the disk contacting surfaces 36, 69 , in a position for normal operation, but which can be retracted against that pressure, thus withdrawing the disk contacting surface 39, 69 away from the surface of the disk 2 , so that the disk 2 may be exchanged without impediment. At least one of these flexibly mounted support arms 22, 52 is included in a position adjustable support arm assembly 20, 50 compris ing an arm 22, 52 on which the head 40, 70 is mounted an anchor member 28, 58 and a flexible means 24, 54 connecting the two, the adjustment of the position of the anchor member enabling the positioning of the disk contact ing surface 39, 69 with respect to the rotational centre of the disk 2 to be effected, by a suitable, known method.
