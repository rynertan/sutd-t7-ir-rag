# Gyroscope apparatus.

## Abstract
Gyroscope apparatus includes a tubular rotor 20 that is supported at opposite ends by bearings, such as a gas lubricated bearing 1 , for rotating about its axis 3 . A gimbal ring 61 encircles the rotor and is resiliently supported with the rotor, for angular displacement about an axis 54 at right angles to the rotor axis 3 , by a pair of flexure pivots 51 and 52 located intermediate the ends of the rotor. An inertia ring 72 is mounted concentrically with the gimbal ring 61 by another pair of flexure pivots 66 and 67 for angular dis placement about an axis 73 at right angles to the rotor axis 3 and the axis of displacement 54 of the gimbal ring. The major part of each flexure pivot 51, 52, 66, 67 is contained within the radial thickness of the gimbal ring. Displacement of the inertia ring is sensed by pick offs 90 to 93 the output of which is used to control the restoring torque applied by torquers 80 to 83 located outwardly of the pick offs.
