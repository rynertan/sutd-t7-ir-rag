# Subsea wellhead assembly.

## Abstract
A subsea wellhead assembly for areas subject to iceberg scouring including an upper conductor 20 in a well bore 16 and a lower conductor 26 in the well bore with the upper end of the lower conductor being within the lower end of the upper con ductor and connected thereto by a weak connection and the upper end of the lower conductor being below the maximum iceberg scour depth and means for connecting said conduc tors, said connecting means having sufficient strenght to with stand bending loads during drilling and being removable for installation of production equipment. Additionally production equipment in the well bore includes a block valve 40 supported within the second conductor and a production string 42 ex tending upward from the block valve 40 and having a weak point within the upper end of the second conductor whereby the well control is not lost by deep iceberg scouring since the production control equipment is within the second conductor which is not damaged by the scouring and the production equipment extending thereabove fails without damage to the lower control equipment of loss of the well.
