# COMMUNICATION DEVICE WITH UNDER RUN SIGNALLING

## Abstract
A communication device comprises a microprocessor which feeds bytes to a universal synchronous receiver trans mitter USRT 88. The USRT transmits the data serially, signal C2TXSO . On an underrun USRT empty before next byte in , the USRT transmits a sequence of flag bytes 01111110 and generates an underrun signal C2TXTXU . This signal is fed to transmit underrun logic 92, where a shift register 350 gen erates a 1 signal which lasts long enough to convert the first two 0 s in the flag byte sequence to 1 s by OR gate 354. A se quence of 8 to 13 1 s is therefore generated prior to the flag bytes, this 1 sequence indicating an underrun condition.
