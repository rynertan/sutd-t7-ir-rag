## Description
CONJUGATED POLYMERS AND PROCESSES FOR PREPARINGAND MODIFYING THEM The present invention relates to novel conjugated polymers containing ethynylene groups and heteroaromatic rings, to processes for producing these polymers and to processes for modifying them. A number of polymers containing conjugated ethynylene groups and aromatic rings are known, specifically the meta and para forms of poly diethynylbenzene are disclosed in J. PolymerSci., A l, 7, 1625 1969 and polymers of the type having a repeating unit of formula EMI2.1 wherein R represents, for example, a thiophene or pyridine ring have very recently been reported in Polymer Preprints, Japan, 30, No. 1, 160 1981 . Of the poly diethynylbenzene polymers, the para form decomposes thermally at 1000C. The heat resistance of poly metadiethynylbenzene can be higher but depends upon the purity of the meta diethynylbenzene used as the starting material. However, it is very difficult to synthesize very pure meta diethynylbenzene and thus, most commonly, poly meta diethynylbenzene decomposes thermally at 2p00C as disclosed in J. Org. Chem., 25, 637 1960 . One of the starting materials used in the preparation of polymers having a repeating unit of formula EMI2.2 is para diethynylbenzene and this is also difficult to synthesize in high purity. Even though these polymers have superior heat resistance to the poly diethynylbenzene s, they have inadequate mouldability and processability because of their insolubility in organic solvents. We have now discovered a class of conjugated polymers containing ethynylene groups and heteroaromatic groups, which can have excellent heat stability and good mouldability. Accordingly, the present invention consists in a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of formula I or of formula II C C Ar C C I Ar C C Ar C C 11 in which Ar and Ar are the same or different and each represents a heteroaromatic ring . The invention also provides a process for preparing a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of the aforementioned formula I in which a diethynyl heteroaromatic compound of formula III HC C Ar C CH III in which Ar is as defined above is subjected to an oxidative coupling reaction with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst comprising a copper compound and an amine compound. The invention also provides a process for preparing a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of the aforementioned formula II in which a diethynyl heteroaromatic compound of the aforementioned formula III is reacted with a di hal o heteroaromatic compound of formula IV X Ar X, IV in which Ar is as defined above and X represents a halogen atom in the presence of an amine compound and of a catalyst comprising a palladium compound and a copper compound. There is still further provided a process for producing a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of the aforementioned formula 11 in which a dihalo heteroaromatic compound of the aforementioned formula IV is reacted with a di Grignard reagent of formula V XMgCEC Ar CCMgX V Lin which Ar is as defined above and X represents a halogen atom, which may be the same as or different from that represented by X in the compound of formula IV in the presence of a palladiumand phosphorus containing catalyst. In the aforementioned formulae, the heteroaromatic rings represented by Ar and Ar are heterocyclic rings having an aromatic character, including, for example, the thiophene, pyridine, furan and pyrrole rings, of which the thiophene and pyridine rings are preferred. The processes for preparing the polymers of the present invention will now be described in more detail.PROCESS A In this process, a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of formula I C C Ar C C I is prepared by subjecting a diethynyl heteroaromatic compound of formula III HC C Ar CiCH ire to oxidative coupling with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst comprising a copper compound and an amine compound. Examples of diethynyl heteroaromatic compounds of formula III which may be used in this process include the diethynylthiophenes, diethynyl pyridines, diethynyl furans and diethynyl pyrrol es, of which we prefer to use the diethynylthiophenes and dlethnyl pyridines, since these are relatively easy to synthesize. Amine compounds, which are one of the components of the catalyst in this process, may be primary amines such as hexylamine, aniline or benzylamine , secondary amines such as dimethylamine, di ethylamine, methylethylamine, N methylaniline or piperidine or tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,Ndimethylaniline, benzyldimethylamine or N,N,N ,N tetramethyl ethylenediamine of which we prefer to use amines having a boiling point within the range from 50 to 1500C such as diethylamine, triethylamine or flN,N ,N tetramethylethylenediamine as this facilitates subsequent treatment of the reaction mixture.The amount of amine is preferably at least 0.005 mole, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 mole, per mole of said diethynyl heteroaromatic compound of formula III . The copper compound, which is the other component of the catalyst used in this process, is preferably a monovalent copper compound, such as cuprous chloride, cuprous iodide, cuprous bromide, cuprous oxide or cuprous cyanide, of which cuprous bromide, cuprous iodide and cuprous chloride are preferred. The amount of this copper compound is preferably at least 0.005 mole, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 mole, per mole of the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound. In carrying out this process, the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound and the catalysts, that is the copper and amine compounds, are first dissolved in a solvent, the nature of which is not critical, provided that it has no adverse effect upon the reactionSuitable solvents include hydrocarbons, ethers, amines, alcohols, ketones, esters and nitrocompounds. However, since the molecular weight of the conjugated polymer formed is often dependent upon the solubility of the polymer in the solvent employed, the use of nitrogen containing compounds such as nitrobenzene, pyridine, methylpyrrolidone or hexamethyl phosphoric triamide is preferred when producing conjugated polymers having a high molecular weight. The oxygen necessary for the oxidative coupling reaction is preferably then blown into the solution. The reaction temperature is preferably within the range from 400C to 1500C and the oxygen is preferably blown through the solution for a period of from 2 to 24 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture, the solvent is then preferably removed by evaporation under reduced pressure and the copper compound is then removed, for example by treatment with an alcoholic solution of an acid for example a methanolic solution of hydrochloric acid . The resulting solution is then suitably filtered to give a powder, which is then washed with a basic solution for example a methanolic solution of an alkali metal hydroxide to give the conjugated polymer of the present invention, normally as a dark brown powder. PROCESS B In this process, a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of formula tit Ar CEC Ar CEC I I is prepared by reacting a diethynyl heteroaromatic compound of formula III HC C Ar C CH III with a dihalo heteroaromatic compound of formula IV X Ar X IV in the presence tf an amine compound and of a catalyst comprising a palladium compound and a copper compound. Suitable diethynyl heteroaromatic compounds, amine compounds and copper compounds for use in this process are as described in connection with Process A. The amount of amine used is preferably at least 5 moles per mole of the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound III and the amount of copper compound is preferably from 0.001 to 0.01 mole per mole of the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound. Suitable palladium compounds for use in this process include Pd PR63 4, Pd PR63 2X22, Pd AsR63 2X22, Pd NR63 2X22, and Pd oCoR6 2 in which R6 represents an alkyl, phenyl or aralkyl group and X2 represents halogen atom, which may be the same as or different from that represented by X and X1 , of whichPd PPh3 4, Pd PPh3 C12 and Pd OCOCH3 Ph represents a phenyl group are particularly preferred. The amount of palladium compound is preferably from 0.001 to 0.1 mole per mole of diethynyl heteroaromatic compound III . In a preferred embodiment of this process of the invention, approximately equimol ar amounts of the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound III and the dihalo heteroaromatic compound IV , together with at least 5 moles of the amine per mole of the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound , are dissolved in a solvent, suitable solvents being those described in Process A. Then the catalysts, that is the palladium compound and the copper compound, are added to the solution, which is then stirred. The reaction temperature is preferably from 500C to 1200C and the time required for the reaction is generally from 1 to 5 hours. At the end of the reaction time, the reaction mixture is preferably cooled, the solution is concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure and the concentrate is washed with an aqueous acid e.g. aqueous hydrochloric acid to remove the ammonium halide and the residual catalysts, after which it is washed with a basic solution such as a methanolic solution of an alkali metal hydroxide . The result is the conjugated polymer of the present invention in the form of a dark brown powder. The dihalo heteroaromatic compound of formula III employed in this process will, of course, depend upon the group Ar which it is desired to incorporate in the final product, but examples of these compounds include the 2,3 , 2,4 , 3,4 and 2,5 di hal othiophenes and the 2,3 , 2,4 , 2,5 , 2,6 , 3,4 and 3,5 di hal opyridines. PROCESS C A conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of formula 11 Ar C C Ar C C 11 is prepared by reacting a dihalo heteroaromatic compound of formula IV X Ar X IV with a di Grtgnard reagent of formula V x MgC C Ar C CMgX V in the presence of a palladium and phosphorus containing catalyst. Suitable dihalo heteroaromatic compounds of formula IV are those suggested above in relation to Process B. Examples of palladium compounds and preferred palladium compounds for use in Process C are also the same as in Process B and the preferred amount of palladium compound used as catalyst is from 0.001 to 0.1 mole per mole of the di Grignard reagent V .Where the palladium compound contains phosphorus, the catalyst need not contain any additional phosphorus compound if, however, the palladium compound is one of those which does not contain phosphorus, then an additional phosphorus compound is necessary as part of the catalyst in Process Ce Suitable phosphorus compounds which may be employed include tri phenyl phosphine, trimethylphosphine, triethyl phosphine, tripropylphosphine, tributylphosphine, tri pentylphosphine, dimethyl phenyl phos phine, methyldiphenylphosphine and tris dimethylamino phosphine. Where a phosphorus compound is used, the amount is preferably from 2 to 5 moles per mole of the palladium compound in the catalyst. In carrying out Process C, we prefer that the di Grignard reagent V and an approximately equimolar amount of the dihalo hetero aromatic compound IV are first dissolved in a solvent, such as an ether. The catalysts, that is the palladium cbmpound and, if necessary, the phosphorus compound, are then added to the solution and the resulting mixture is stirred. The reaction temperature is preferably from 40 C to 1400C and the time required for the reaction is normally from 2 to 5 hours. After completion of the reaction, the resulting solid is washed with an aqueous acid e.g. aqueous hydrochloric acid to remove residual catalysts and then with a basic solution such as a methanolic solution of an alkali metal hydroxide . The product is the conjugated polymer of the invention in the form of a dark brown powder. The diethynyl heteroaromatic compounds of formula III , which are one of the starting materials used in Processes A and B may, for example, be prepared by any of the following Processes D, E and F. Process D Diethynyl heteroaromatic compounds can be prepared by reacting a dihalo heteroaromatic compound with an ethynylsilyl compound of formula VI R1R2R3SiCH vi in which R1, R2 and R3 are the same or different and each represents an alkyl, aryl or alkenyl group in the presence of a dehalogenating agent and a catalyst comprising a palladium compound and a copper compound, followed by de silylating the reaction product with a metal halide. Suitable dihalo heteroaromatic compounds for use in this process include dihalothiophenes, di hal opyri dines, di hal opyrrol es and di hal ofurans, of which the dihalothiophenes and dihalopyridines are preferred because of the ease with which they react, the dihalothiophenes being particularly preferred. The halogen atoms in these dihalo heteroaromatic compounds are preferably chlorine or bromine atoms. Examples of the groups represented by R1, R2 and R3 in the ethynylsilyl compound of formula VI include such alkyl groups as the methyl, ethyl and propyl groups, such aryl groups as the phenyl group and such alkenyl groups as the vinyl and Isopropenyl groups, of which alkyl and aryl groups are preferred because of the ease with which they react, the methyl group being particularly preferred. The amount of ethynylsilyl compound VI is preferably from 2 to 2.5 moles per mole of the dihalo heteroaromatic compound. Suitable palladium compounds for use as the catalyst in this process have been illustrated in relation to ProcessB, preferred compounds for use in Process D being those of formulaPd PPh3 2Br2 and Pd PPh3 2C12 Ph represents a phenyl group .These palladium compounds are preferably used in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.1 mole per mole of the dihal o heteroaromatic compound. Suitable copper compounds for use as the other component of the catalyst in this process have been illustrated in relation to Process A. These copper compounds are preferably used in an amount of from 0.005 to 0.1 mole per mole of said ethynylsilyl compound VI . The dehalogenating agent used in this process is most preferably an amine. Any amine may be used, provided that it is capable of forming an ammonium halide and thus suitable amines include primary amines such as hexylamine, aniline and benzylamine , secondary amines such as dimethyl amine, diethyl amine, methyl ethyl amine, N methylaniline and piperidine and tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, N,N dimethylanlline, benzyidimethyl amine and N,N,N ,N tetramethylethylenediamine , of which we prefer to use amines having a boiling point of from 50 C to 1500C such as diethylamine, triethylamine or N,N,N ,N1 tetramethyl ethylenediamine as this facilitates subsequent treatment of the reaction mixture. The amount of dehalogenating agent used is preferably at least 5 moles, and more preferably from 5 to 1000 moles, per mole of the dihal o heteroaromatic compound. Although this amine can also serve as the reaction solvent, it is possible to use one or more other solvents together with the amine. Suitable such additional solvents include hydrocarbons e.g. hexane or benzene , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. methylene chloride or chloroform and ethers e.g. diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran . The preferred de silylating agents for use in this process are metal halides, particularly alkali metal halides, such as potassium fluoride, potassium bromide, potassium iodide, potassium chloride, sodium iodide, sodium fluoride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, lithium fluoride, lithium iodideS lithium chloride or lithium bromide, of which potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride are preferred. The amount of de silylating agent used is preferably from 0.01 to 1 mole per mole of the intermediate compound of formula VII R1R2R3SiC C Ar C CSiRlR2R3 VII which is formed by the reaction of the dihalo heteroaromatic compound and the ethynylsilyl compound VI . In carrying out this process, we prefer that the di hal o heteroaromatic compound and the ethynylsilyl compound VI should first be dissolved in a solvent containing or consisting of an amine. After adding to the solution a palladium compound and a copper compound as catalysts, the resulting mixture is heated, with stirring. The mixture is preferably heated to a temperature of from 20 C to 100µC and the time required for the reaction will generally be from 1 to 8 hours. Although the nature of the atmosphere under which the reaction is carried out is not critical, we prefer to carry out the reaction in an atmosphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen. This reaction produces an ammonium halide and the aforementioned intermediate compound of formula VII .Upon completion of this reaction, the insoluble by product, i.e. the ammonium halide, is removed by filtration and the low boiling point substances in the filtrate are removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue is then extracted with a solvent for the intermediate VII , for example benzene. The extracted solution is then preferably treated with activated carbon in order to remove any small quantity of impurities from the extract. Although any amount of activated carbon may be used, we prefer to use from 0.2 to 2 parts by weight of activated carbon per part by weight of dihalo heteroaromatic compound, since too small an amount removes inusufficient of the impurities whilst too large an amount decreases the yield of intermediate VII . After the treatment with activated carbon, the carbon is removed by filtration and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness, whereupon crystals of the intermediate VII are deposited. Subsequently, these crystals are reacted with a metal halide as previously exemplified in an organic solvent, after which the solvent is removed. The organic solvent should be one in which the metal halide and the intermediate VII can dissolve, for example an ether, amine, ketone, aldehyde, sulphoxide, alcohol or ester. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature of from 400C to 100C and the reaction time is generally at least 1 hour. Although the atmosphere under which the reaction is carried out is not critical, we prefer to carry out the reaction under an atmosphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen.The resulting reaction mixture is then extracted with a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether to remove the metal halide, after which the extraction solvent is removed by distillation, to give the diethynyl heteroaromatic compound as an oil. Process E Diethynyl heteroaromatic compounds can also be produced by reacting a dihal o heteroaromatic compound with a propargyl alcohol derivative in te presence of a dehalogenating agent and of a catalyst comprising a palladium compound and a copper compound, followed by the deketonating the reaction product with a suitable deketonating agent. Suitable dihalo heteroaromatic compounds, palladium compounds, copper compounds, dehalogenating agents and reaction solvents for use in this process are all as illustrated in relation to Process D. The propargyl alcohol derivative is suitably a compound of formula VIII EMI18.1 in which R4 and R5 are the same or different and each represents an alkyl group e.g. methyl, ethyl or propyl , an aryl group e.g. phenyl or an alkenyl group e.g. vinyl or isopropenyl we prefer that R4 and R5 should both represent methyl groups, since such a compound is commercially available and since this facilitates the subsequent deketonating reaction. This propargyl alcohol derivative is preferably used in an amount of from 2.0 to 3.0 moles per mole ofthe of the o heteroaromatic compound. The deketonating agent is preferably a basic substance, for example an alkali metal edge lithium or sodium , an alkali metal hydroxide e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide , an alkali metal alkoxide e.g. sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide or an alkyl alkali metal e.g. butyllithium , of which sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are preferred. The amount of deketonating agent is preferably from 0.1 to 1 mole per mole of the intermediate compound of formula IX EMI19.1 in which R4 and R5 are as defined above , which is prepared by the reaction between the di halo heteroaromatic compound and the propargyl alcohol derivative VIII . In a preferred way of carrying out this process, the dihalo heteroaromatic compound and the propargyl alcohol derivative, e.g. the compound of formula VIII , are dissolved in a solvent containing a dehalogenating agent such as an amine. The palladium and copper compounds are then added, as catalysts, and the resulting mixture is allowed to react, with stirring. The reaction temperature is preferably from 15 to.700C and the time required for the reaction will generally be from 10 to 20 hours. Although the atmosphere under which the reaction is carried out is not critical, we prefer to employ an inert atmosphere, for example one of nitrogen. This reaction forms an ammonium halide and the aforementioned intermediate, e.g. the compound of formula IX . After completion of the reaction, the ammonium halide is removed by washing the reaction mixture with water, and then the mixture is extracted with an ether. The low boiling point substances are then removed by distillation under reduced pressure, after which the residue is purified by distillation under reduced pressure. The resulting intermediate compound IX is then subjected to deketonation by reacting it with a deketonating agent particularly an alkali metal hydroxide in an organic solvent, after which the resulting insoluble substances are removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated. The organic solvent may be any substance in which the intermediate IX can dissolve and suitable compounds include hydrocarbons, ethers, amines, aldehydes, sulphoxides, alcohols and esters. The temperature at which the deketonation reaction is carried out is preferably from 500C to 1500C and the time required for the reaction will generally be from 1 to 5 hours.Although the atmosphere under which the reaction Is carried out is not cntlcal, we prefer to employ an inert atmosphere, for example an atmosphere of nitrogen gas.On purifying the reaction product, there is obtained a diethynyl heteroaromatic compound of formula III .Process F 2,6 Diethynylpyridine can also be produced by hitherto known processes, for example, by reacting a 2,6 dihalopyridine and trimethylsilylacetylene in an amine in the presence of a catalytic amount of bis triphenylphosphine dichloropalladium and cuprous Iodize, and then treating the resulting 2,6 bis trimethylsilylethynyl pyridine with a dilute aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide in methanol at room temperature Synthesi , p. 627 1980 . When the conjugated polymer of the invention is prepared by Process A, the terminal atoms on the polymer chain are usually hydrogen atoms. When the polymer is produced by Processes B and C, the terminal atoms on the polymer chain are usually hydrogen or halogen atoms. The degree of polymerisation of these polymers is not critical to the present invention however, they are usually obtained as a product having a degree of polymerisation within the range from 10 to 1000 although products outside this range are also obtainable. Products having a degree of polymerisation within the range from 10 to 400 are particularly easy to produce. It is also possible to modify those conjugated polymers of the present invention which have a repeating unit represented by the aforementioned formula I , by employing either of the following Proces G and H.Process G t In this process, a conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of formula I . C C Ar C C I is reacted with an amine of formula X NH2R7 X R7 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group in the presence of a copper compound, to convert all or some of the diethynylene structures which have the formula C C C into a structure of formula XI EMI23.1 In the amine of formula X used in this process, R7 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl or hexyl , an aryl group e.g. phenyl or tolyl or an aralkyl group e.g. benzyl or diphenylmethyl .Examples of such compounds include the alkylamines such as methylamine, propylamine or hexylamine , the aromatic amines such as aniline or e toluidine and the aralkylamines such as benzylamine , as well as ammonia itself. In order to ensure that all of the diethynylene structures are reacted with the amine, we prefer to use from 5 to 100 equivalents of amine per diethynylene structure in the conjugated polymer, in view of the reactivity of these amines. If the amount of amine is less than 1 equivalent per diethynylene structure, then only some of these structures will, of course, react with the amine and be converted to the structure of formula XI . Suitable copper compounds are those already exemplified in relation to Processes D and E and the amount of copper compound is preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight per part by weight of the conjugated polymer. The reaction between the conjugated polymer and the amine is preferably carried out by dissolving the two reagents in a solvent and heating them, with stirring, in the presence of the copper compound. Although it is not critical to the process, we prefer that the reaction should take place under an atmosphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Suitable solvents for this process are those hitherto exemplified in relation to ProcessA. The reaction temperature is preferably from 60 C to 200eC. The reaction time cannot be specified simply, since it depends very much on the amount of amine used and on the kind of conjugated polymer, but generally the reaction will take from 30 minutes to 48 hours. After completion df the reaction, the reaction mixture is preferably concentrated under reduced pressure, treated with an acidic aqueous alcohol or similar reagent to remove the copper compound and filtered. The powder collected by filtration is then preferably treated with a basic solution such as methanolic sodium hydroxide and filtered to give the modified conjugated polymer, generally as a black powder.Process H In this process, the conjugated polymer having a recurring unit of formula I is reacted with hydrogen sulphide, thus converting some or all of the diethynylene structures in the conjugated polymer into structures of formula XII EMI25.1 The way in which the conjugated polymer is reacted with hydrogen sulphide is not critical to this process however, we would normally prefer to dissolve the conjugated polymer in a suitable solvent and then effect the reaction by blowing dry hydrogen sulphide through the solution. The reaction time cannot be estimated simply, because it depends upon the rate at which the hydrogen sulphide is blown through the solution and on the nature of the conjugated polymer however, generally the reaction will take from 30 minutes to 24 hours. The reaction temperature is preferably within the range from 20 C to 2000C.Suitable solvents are as exemplified in relation to Process A. After completion of the reaction, we prefer that the reaction mixture should be concentrated and the concentrate mixed with a non solvent for the conjugated polymer such as methanol to reprecipitate the polymer, giving the modified conjugated polymer in the form of a powder. The various conjugated polymers produced by the processes of the invention are superior to poly diethynylbenzene in heat resistance thus, whereas poly diethynylbenzene thermally decomposes at a temperature of 200 C or even lower, the polymers of the present invention are normally stable even at 3000C, without thermal decomposition. Furthermore, although the aforementioned polymers having a repeating unit of formula EMI26.1 are insoluble in organic solvents, the various conjugated polymers of the present invention are soluble in a wide range of organic solvents, including chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, N,N dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone, pyridine, aniline, hexamethyl phosphoric triamide and dimethyl sulphoxide. Accordingly, it is possible to mould the conjugated polymers of the invention easily simply by casting a solution of them in a suitable solvent.Moreover, it is possible to convert the conjugated polymers of the present invention into organic semiconductors and organic conductors having various electric conductivities by doping them to varying extents with a variety of dopants, including electron donative compounds and electron attractive compounds. For example, by doping the polymers of the invention with sulphuric acid, it is possible to increase electrical conductivity by as much as 108 times or even more. Thus, the conjugated polymers of the invention have excellent stability, valuable mouldability and are useful as organic semiconductors or organic conductors. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following Examples. In the Examples, the degrees of polymerisation n of the conjugated polymers have been calculated from the number average molecular weight Rn , which, in turn, has been calculated from the polystyrene reduced number average molecular weight Rn of the conjugated polymer, as measured in N methylpyrrolidone as solvent, using a high temperature high speed gel permeation chromatograph model 150 C GPC ALC, manufactured by Waters Co., U.S.A. and the following Q factor a molecular weight correction factor . QCP QPS 0.25 9CP is the Q factor of the conjugated polymer and QPS is the Q factor of polystyrene , where the structure of the conjugated polymer and the bulkiness of the conjugated polymer in solution are taken into consideration. EXAMPLE 1Preparation of 2,6 diethynyl pyridine This method is based upon that described in Synthesis ,page 627 1980 . Under a stream of nitrogen, 24.8 grams 104.7 mmoles of 2,6 dibromopyridine, 22.6 grams 230.3 mmoles of trimethylsilyl acetylene and 250 ml of diethylamine were charged into a 500 ml three necked flask and thoroughly stirred. 1.6 grams 2.3 mmoles of dichlorobis triphenylphosphine palladium and 0.44 grams 2.3 mmoles of cuprous iodide were then added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the insoluble diethylammonium bromide which precipitated was removed by filtration, the filtrate was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted with 100 ml of benzene. The benzene solution thus obtained was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, giving 19.5 g of a brown solid containing 2,6 bis trimethylsilylethynyl pyridine.
