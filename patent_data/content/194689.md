# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INPUT PICTURE ENHANCEMENT BY REMOVAL OF UNDESIRED DOTS AND VOIDS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for removing undesirable dots and voids which are smaller than the user defined smallest data item of a bit map image 60 of a picture being scanned by a picture coding system. The bit map 60 is delayed as it is being generated to form a series of tessellations or windows 62, 63, 64 of data of selected sizes. The windows are propagated through a series of neighborhood logic elements which with the output data level of the outer ring of neighborhood logic elements which define the window being examined to determine if those data levels are all of the same sense. If they are all of the same sense, then all of the neighborhood logic elements which define the interior of the window 62, 63, 64 are set or cleared so that the output data levels of al of the neighborhood logic elements which define the window are of the same sense.
