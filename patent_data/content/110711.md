# One component type red color magnetic developer.

## Abstract
A one component type red color magnetic developer for use in electrophotography and having a self electroscopic property, comprises particles of a composition comprising 100 parts by weight of a magnetic powder composed mainly of ocherous gamma type diirion trioxide, 2.5 to 30 parts by weight of a red azo pigment and 40 to 200 parts by weight of a binder resin and, when a fixed image of the particles is meas ured by a color difference meter, the value x is from 0.51 to 0.73, the value y is from 0.22 to 0.40 and the value Y is from 5 to 65 wherein x and y represent chromatocity coordinates and Y represents the ligthness.
