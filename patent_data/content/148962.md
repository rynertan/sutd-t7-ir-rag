Small amounts of the piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers of this invention when combined with synthetic resin improve the light stability of the resin. The amount of the piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers is generally within the range from about 0.001 to about 10 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.01 to about 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of resin. Synthetic resins that can have their resistance to deterioration enhanced with piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers according to this invention include a olefin polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, poly 3 methylbutene, or mixtures thereof and with copolymers other monomers such as ethylenevinyl acetate copolymer ethylene propylene copolymer polystyrene polyvinyl acetate polyacrylic esters copolymers from styrene and another monomer for example, maleic an hydride, butadiene, and acrylonitrile acrylonitrile butadiene styrene coplymer, acrylic acid ester butadiene styrene copolymer, methacrylic acid ester butadiene styrene copolymer, polymethacrylate esters such as polymethacrylate polWinyl alcohol polyvinyl formal polyvinyl butyral linear polyesters polyamides polycarbonates polyacetates polyurethanes cellulosic resins phenol formaldehyde resins urea formalddhyde resins melamine formalddhyde resins epoxy resins unsaturated polyester resins silicone resins halogen containing resins such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride polyvinyl idene fluoride, and copolymers thereof, and rubbers such as isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, dhloroprene rubber, and blends of any of the above. The piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers of the invention can be combined with conventional heat stabilizers such as phenolic antioxidants, polyvalent metal salts of organic acids, organic phosphites, thioesters, and other known heat stabilizers, thereby constituting light and heat stabilizer compositions of the invention. The phenolic antioxidant contains one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups, and one or more phenolic nuclei, and can contain from about eighto about three hundred carbon atm Tn addition, the phenolic nucleus can contain an oxy or thio ether group. The a1Iyl substituted phenols and polynuclear phenols, because of their molecular weight, have a higher boiling point, and therefore are preferred because of their lower volatility. There can be one or a plurality of alkyl groups of one or more carbon atoms. The alkyl group or groups Including any alkylene groups between phenol nuclei preferably aggregate at least four carbon atoms. The longer the aryl or alkylene chain, the better the compatibility with polypropylene, inasmuch as the phenolic compound then acquires more of an aliphatic hydrocarbon character md therefore there is no upper limit on the number of alk yl carbon atoms. tsually, from the standpoint of avail ability, the compound will not have more than about eighteen carbon atoms in an alkyl, alicyclidene and alkylene group, and a toLal of not over about fifty carbon atoms. The compounds may have from one to four alkyl radicals per phenol nucleus. The phenol contains at least one and preferably at least two phenolic hydroxys, the two or more hydroxyls being in the same ring, if there is only one. In the case of bicyclic phenols, the rings can be linked by thio or oxyether groups, or by alkylene, alicyclidene or arylidene groups. Tile monocyclic phenols which can be employed have the structure EMI49.1 R is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen halogen and organic radicals containing from one to about thirty carbon atoms, such as alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, and acyl there R is aryl, alkyl or cycloallyl. EMI49.2 x1 and x2 are integers from one to four, and the sum o x1 and x2 does not exceed six. Tlie polycylic phenol phenol is one having at least two aromatic nuclei linked by a polyvalent linking radical, as defined by the formula EMI50.1 wherein Y is a polyvalent linking group selected from the group consisting of oxygen carbonyl sulfur sulfinyl aromatic, allphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon groups and oxyhydrocarbon, thiohydrocarbon and heterocyclic groups. The linking group can have from one up to twenty carbon atoms At is a phenolic nucleus which can be a phenyl or a polycarbocyclic group having condensed or separate phenyl rings each Ar group contains at least one free phen6lic hydroxyl group up to a total of five.The Ar rings can also include additional rings connected by additional linking nuclei of the type Y, for example, Ar Y Ar Y Ar. m1 and m2 are numbers from one to five, and n1 andn2 are numbers of one or greater, and preferably from one to four. The aromatic nucleus Ar can, in addition to phenolic hydroxyl groups, include one or more inert substituents. Examples of such inert substituents include hydrogen, halogen atoms, e. g., chlorine, bromine and fluorine organic radicals containing from one to about thirty carbon atoms, such as alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy and acyloxy EMI50.2 where R is aryl, alkyl or cyclo alkyl, or thiohydrocarbon groups having from one to about thirty carbon atoms, and carboxylEMI51.1 groups. Usually, however, each aromatic nucleus will not have more than about eighteen carbon atoms in any hydrocarbon substituent group. The Ar group can have from one to four substituent groups per nucleus. Typical aromatic nuclei include phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthryl, triphenylenyl, anthracenty, pyrenyl, chrysenyl, and fluoroenyl groups. When Ar is abenzene nucleus, the polyhydric polycyclic phenol has the structure EMI51.2 wherein Ri, Ra and R3 are inert substituent groups as describedIn the previous paragraph m, and m3 are integers from one to a maximum of five m2 is an integer from one to a maximum of four x1 and x3 are integers from zero to four and x2 Is an integer from zero to three y1 is an integer from zero to about six and y2 is an integer from one to five, preferably one or two Preferably, the hydroxy groups are located ortho and or para to Y. Exemplary Y groups are allWlene, alkylidene, and alkenylene arylene,alkyl arylene,arylalkylene cycloalkylene, cycloalkylidene and oxa and thia substituted such groups tetrahydrohranes, esters and triazino groups. The Y groups are usually bi, tri, or tetravalent, connecting two, three or four Ar groups. However, higher valency Y groups conneting more than four Ar group, con also be used.According to their constitution, the Y groups can be assigned to subgenera as follows 1 Y groups where at least one carbon in a chain or cyclic arrangement connect the aromatic groups, such as EMI52.1 EMI53.1 EMI53.2 2 Y groups where only atoms other than carbon link the aromatic rings, such as rEMI53.3 and S x where x is a number from one to ten 3 Y groups made up of more than a single atom including both carbon and other atoms linking the aromatic nuclei such as EMI54.1 EMI54.2 Although the relation o.f effectiveness to chemical structure is InsufficientLy understood, many of the most effective phenols have Y groups of subgenus t , and accordingly this is preferred.Some of these phenols can be prepared by the alkylaction of phenols or alkyl phenols with polyunsaturated hydrocarbons such as dicyclopentadiene or butadiene. Representative phenols include guiacol, resorcinol monoacetate, vanillin, butyl salicylate, 2, 6 di tert butyl 4 methyl phenol, 2 tert butyl 4 methoxy phenol, 2,4 dinonyl phenol, 2,3,4,5 tetradecyl phenol, tetrahydro alpha naphthol, o , m and p cresol, o , m and p phenylphenol, o , m and p xylenols, the carvenols, symmetrical xylenol, thymol, o , mand p nonyltenol, o , m and p dodecyl phenol, and o , mand p octyl phenol, o , and m tert butyl p hydroxy anisolet p n decyloxy phenol, p n decyloxy cresol, nonyl n decyloxycresol, eugenol, isoeugenol, glyceryl monosalicylate, methyl p hydroxy cinnamate, 4 benzyloxy phenol, p acetylaminophenol, p stearyl aminophenol, methyl p hydroxybknzoate, p dichlorbenzoyl aminophenol, p hydroxysalicyl anilide, stearyl 3,5 di methyl 4 hydroxy benzyl thioglycolate, stearyl ss 4 hydroxy 3,5 di t butylphenyl propionate, distearyl 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzylphosphinate, and distearyl 4 hydroxy 3 methyl 5 t butyl benzylmalonate.

These are described in U.S. patent No. 3, 567, 683, dated March 2, 1971 to Spacht. A com mercially available member of this class is Wingstay L, exemplified by dicyclopentadiene tri 2 tert butyl 4 methyl phenol of the formula EMI59.1 The polyhydric polycyclic phenols used in the invention can also be condensation products of phenols or alkylphenols with hydrocarbons having a bicyclic ring structure and a double bond or two or more double bonds, such as a pinene, ss pinene, dipentene, limonene, vinylcyclohexene, dicyclopentadiene, allo ocimene, isoprene and butadiene.These condensation products are usually obtained under acidic conditions in Lhe form of more or less complex mixtures of monomeric and polymeric compounds. However, it is usually not necessary to isolate the individual constituents. The entire reaction product, merely freed from the acidic condensation catalyst axid un changed starting material, can be used with excellent results. While the exact structure of these phenolic condensation products is uncertain, the Y groups linking the phenolic nuclei all fall into the preferred subgenus 1. For method of prepara tion, see e.g., U.S. patent No. 3,124,555, U.S. patent No. 3,242,13f, and British patent No. 961,504. When the stabilizer composition is used in conjunction with a polyvalent metal salt of an organic acid, the organic acid will ordinarily have from about six to about twenty four carbon atoms. The polyvalent metal can be any metal of. Group U of the Periodic Table, such as zinc, calcium, cadmium, barium, magnesium and strontium. The alkali metal salts and heavy metal salts such as lead salts are unsatisfactory The acid can be any organic non nitrogenous monocarboxylic acid having from six to twenty four carbon atoms. The aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic and oxigen containing heterocyclic organic acids are operable as a class. By the term aliphatic acid is meant any open chain carboxylic acid, substituted, if desired, with nonreactive groups, such as halogen, sulfur and hydroxyl. By the term alicyclic it will be understood that there isIntended any cyclic acid in which the ring is nonaromatic and composed solely of carbon atoms, and such acids may if desired have inert, nonreactive substituents such as halogen, hydros alkyl radicals, alkenyl radicals and other carbocyclic ring structures c ondensed therewith. The oxygen containing hetero cyclic compounds can be aromatic or nonaromatic and can include oxygen and carbon in the ring structure, such as allg substituted furoic acid The aromatic acids likewise can have nonreactive ring substituents such as halogen, allyl and alkenyl groups, and other saturated or aromatic rings condensed there with. As exemplary of the acids which can be used in the form of their metal salts there can be mentioned the following hexoic acid, 2 ethylhexoic acid, n octoic acid, isooctoic acid, caprice acid, undecylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid behenic acid, chlorocaproic acid, hydroxy capric acid, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, but benzoic acid, ethyl benzoic acid, propyl benzoic acid, hexyl benzoic acid, salicyclic acid, naphthoic acid, 1 naphthalene acetic acid, orthobenzoyl benzoic acid, naphthenic acids derived from petroleum, abietic acid, dihydroabietic acid, hexahydrobenzoic acid, and methyl furoic acid. The water insoluble salts are preferred, because they are not leached out when the plastic is in contact with water. Where these salts are not know, they are made by the usual types of reactions, such as by mixing the acid, or anhydride with the corresponding oxide or hydroxide o the metal in a liquid solvent, and heating, if necessary, until salt formation is complete. A variety of organic triphosItes and acid phosphites can be employed, of which the following are exemplary. The organic triphosphite can be any organic phosphite having three or more organic radicals attached to phosphorus through oxygen. The acid phosphite can be any organic phosphite having one or two organic radicals attached to phosphorus through oxygen. These radicals can be monovalent radicals, in the case of the triphosphites, diphosphites and monophisphites. The organic triphosphites in which the radicals are monovalent radicals can be defined by the formed EMI62.1 in which R1, R2 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aikaryl, aralkyl, and cycloallyl groups having from one to about thirty carbon atoms. The acid phosph ites are defined by the same formula, but one or tmo of R1, R2, and R3 is hydrogen or a cation of a metal or ammonium. Also included are the organic triphosphites having a bivalent organic radical forming a heterocyclic ring with the phosphorus oE the type EMI63.1 in which R4 is a bivalent organic radical selected from the grpup consisting of alkylene, arylene, aralkylene, alkarylene and cycloalkylene radicals having from two to about thirty carbon atoms, and R1, is a monovalent organic radical as defined above in the case of R1, R2, and R3 R5 is hydrogen or a cation, in the case of the acid phosphites. Also useful organic triphosphites are mixed hetero cyclic open chain phosphites of the type EMI63.2 More complex triphosphites are formed from trivalent organic radicals, of the type EMI63.3 in which R6 is a trivalent organic radical of any of the types of 1 to R5, inclusive, as defined above. A particularly useful class of complex triphosphites are the tetraoxadiphosphaspiro undecanes of the formula EMI64.1 where R1 and R2 are selected from the group consisting of aryl, alkyl, aryloxyethyl, alkyloxyethyl, aryloxyethoxyethyl, alkyloxyethoxyethyl and alkyloxypolyethoxyethyl having from about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms. In the case of the acid phosphites, one or both of R1 and R2 is also hydrogen or a cation. An especially preferred class of organic triphosphites and acid phosphites have a bicyclic aromatic group attached to phosphorus through oxygen, with no one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups on either or both of the aromatic rings. These phosphites are characterized by the formula EMI64.2 in which Ar is a mono or bicyclic aromatic nucleus and m is an integer of from 0 to about 5.EMI65.1 is one or a plurality of organic radicals as defined above for R1 to R67 taken singly or together in sufficient number to satisfy the valences of The two phosphite oxygen atoms.One or bothEMI65.2 also hydrogen, in the case of the acid phosphites, and can include additional bicyclic aromatic groups of the type HO m Ar. The cation in the case of acid phosphites can be a metal, such as an alkali metal, for instance, sodium, potassium or lithium an alkaline earth metal, for instance, barium, calcium, or a nontoxic polyvalent metal, such as magnesium, tin and zinc.

The R radical of these esters is important in furnishing compatibility with the polymer. The Y radical is desirably a different radical, R2 or M or a polymer, here R is rather low in molecular weight, so as to compensate for This in.obteining the optimum compatibility and nonvolatility.

A sufficient amount of the stabilizer or combination i s used to improve the resistance of the synthetic polymer to deterioration in physical properties when exposed to heat and light, including, for example, discoloration, reduction in melt viscosity and embrittlement. Very small aznounts are usually adecluate. Amounts within the range from about O. Q01 to about 5 . total stabilizers including the piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers of the invention by weight of the polymer are satisfactory. Preferably, from 0.01 to 3 is employed for optimum stabilization. The stabilizer systems of the invention are readily rendered in solid particulate form, comprising a blend of a piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers light stabilizer in an amount of from about 10 to about 35 parts by weight and optionally b a phenolic antioxidant in an amount from about 10 to about 35 parts by weight and or c other heat or light stabilizers in an amount of from about 10 to about 35 parts by weight. The piperidyl triazinyl spirodiamine and spiro glycol ethers light stabilizer of the invention can be employed in combination with phenolic antioxidant and or other conventional heat and light stabilizers for the particular synthetic polymer. Thus, for example, in the case of polyvinyl chloride resins, other polyvinyl chloride resin heat stabilizers can be included, including polyvalent metal fatty acid salts such as barium and cadmium salltsof the higher fatty acids organotin compounds and epoxy compounds and organic phosphites. With polyolefin resins there can be employed fatty acid salts of polyvalent metals, and the higher fatty acid esters of thiodipropionic acids, such as, for example, dilauryl thio dipr opi onate. With. polyamide resin compositions, polyamide stabilizers such as copper salts in combination with iodides and or other phosphorus compounds and salts of divalent manganese can be used. With synthetic rubbers and acrylonitrile butadienestyrene terpolymers, other antioxidants and polyvalent metal salts of the higher fatty acids can be used. In addition, other conventional additives for synthetic polymers, such as plasticizers, lubricants, emulsifiers, antistatic agents, flame proofing agents, pigments and fillers, can be employed. The stabilizer or combination is incorporated in the polymer in suitable mixing equipnaent, such as a mill or a Banbry mi er. If the polymer has a melt viscosity which is too high for Ule desired use, the polymer can be worried until its melt viscosity has been reduced to the desired range before addition of the stabilizer. Mixing is continued until the mixture is substantially uniform. The resulting composition is then removed fromThe mixing equipment and brought to the size and shape desired for marketing or use. The stabilized polymer can be worked into the desired shape, such as by milling, calendering, extruding or injection molding or fiber forming. In such operations, it will be found to have a considerably improved resistance to reduction in melt viscosity during the heating, as well as a better resistance to discoloration and elnbrittlement on ageing and heating The following Examples represent preferred embodiments of stabilizer systems and resin compositions of the invention Examples 1 to 9 Polypropylene compositions were prepared using stabilizers of the invention and two of the prior art, and having the following formulation Ingredient Parts by WeightPolypropylene 100Stearyl ss 3,5 di tert butyl 4hydroxyphenyl propionate 0. 2Stabilizer as shown in Table I 0.3 The compositions were thoroughly blended in aBraberder Piastograph, and then compression molded to form sheets 0.3 mm thick.

Examples 56 to 62 The stabilizers of this invention are effective light stabilizers for coatings. The effect of the stabilizer in a two coat metallic effect finish comprising metallic effect priming lacquer and unpigmented finishing lacquer was determined. a Metallic effect priming lacquer Methyl methacrylate 100 g, n butylacrylate 66 g, 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate 30 g, methacrylic acid 4 g, xylene 80 g and n butanol 20 g were heated with stirring at 110 C, and a solution of azobisisobutyronitrile 2 g, dodecylmercaptane 0. 5 g, xylene 80 g and n butanol 20 g was added dropwise over 3 hours. The solution was stirred an additional 2 hours at 110 C, resulting in an acrylic resin solution. This acrylic resin solution 12 parts, butoxylated methylolmelamine Mitsui Toatsu Co., Yuban 20SE60 solids content 6O9. 2.5 parts, cellulose acetobutyrate 20 butylacetate solution 50 parts, aluminum pigment Toyo AluminumCo., Alpaste 1123N 5.5 parts, xylene 10 parts, butyl acetate 20 parts and copper phthalocyanine blue 0. 2 parts were blended. b Unpigmented finishing lacquer The above acrylic resin solution 48 parts, butoxylated methylolmelamine 10 parts, xylene 10 parts, butoxyethylacetate 4 parts, and stabilizer as shown in TableVIII 0.15 part, were blended. Pieces of steel sheeting which were coated with a primer, were first coated with the priming lacquer and subsequently with the finishing lacquer. The priming lacquer was sprayed on to a thickness of about 20 , and aired for 10 minutes. Then the clear lacquer was sprayed on to a thickness of about 30 . After being aired 15 minutes the samples were stoved for 30 minutes at 14000. The coated sheets were exposed to ultraviolet light in a Weather O Meter. The time in hours when degradation set in, as determined by a cracking on a surface of sheet, was noted as hours to failure, and the results are shown inTable VIII.
