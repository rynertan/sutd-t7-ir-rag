# Plunger suitable for use in a glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a loading and transfer apparatus 1 capable of being connected to a hauling vehicle, an a paratus by means of which a cassette 10 carrying a load, for example containers, is transferred from the harbor area into a ship and is unloaded from the ship at the port of des tination. Such apparatuses, also called trailers, are known previously, but the disadvantage of the known apparatuses has been their poor steerability and their large operating space requirement owing to their long and completely rigid or articulated frame. The steerability of the apparatus ac cording to the invention has been improved and its operating space requirement has been reduced by making the frame telescopic 6, 6a, 6b , in which case the frame can be used in its shortened form whenever there is no cassette being transferred. Thus, the loading and transfer apparatus, short ened to about half its length, is driven to a place in front of the cassette to be transferred, from where the movement continues by driving the frame under the cassette. While the frame is being driven under the cassette, it is extended to its full length so that the cassette fits on it. The apparatus, in its full length, is now moved with its cassette to the cassette parking site. When the frame parts of the loading and transfer apparatus are being drawn from under the cassette, they are simultaneously shortened, whereupon the apparatus is dri ven in its shortened form to fetch the next cassette. In the forward end of the loading and transfer apparatus, as seen in the driving direction, there is preferably a bogie 5 with wheels, the bogie being connected to a lifting and turning mechanism.
