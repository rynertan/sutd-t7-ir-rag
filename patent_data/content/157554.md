# Polypropylene sheet.

## Abstract
In a polypropylene sheet, the base material is a propylene based polymer having a melt flow rate of not more than 5 and a propylene unit content of not less than 70 by weight, and i the maximum value Ftmax among the values Ft s of inte gration of the force parallel to the sheet plane as apperaring upon heating the sheet at a temperature above its melting point over the period during which the force is observed falls within the range of 0.5 45 kg.minute cm², the ratio RFt between Ft s measured in directions at right angles to each other on the sheet plane is not more than 10, and the melting point Tms of the sheet is higher than the melting point Tmr of the sheet as measured after melting followed by recrystallization in the unstrained condition, the melting point difference ΔTms Tms Tmr being at least 3 C, and or ii the average notched izod impact strength of the sheet at 0 C is at least 50 kg.cm cm, and the average notched izod impact strength at 30 C is at least 30 kg.cm cm. Such sheets have markedly improved impact strength, particularly at low temperatures, and are free of anisotropy and can be easily shaped.
