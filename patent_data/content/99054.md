## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE IN TION Field of the Invention This invention relates to a method of conveying an image sheet used for recording and reproducing an image.By image sheet is meant a sheet like material comprising a substrate layer and an image recording layer such as stimulable phosphor layer or photoconductive layer provided on the substrate, ror e ample, a stimulable phosphor sheet for recording a radiation image therein as described, e.g. in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,236,078, 4,239,968, 4,350,893, 4,368,390 and 4,380,702, U.S. Patent Appln.No. 156,520, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 1982 24900 , electrophotographic sheet or the like. Description of the Prior Art After an image is recorded on an image sheet at a recording section, the image sheet is conveyed to a reproducing section for processing such as for transfer or read out of the recorded image this processing is broadly referred to as reproducing . For this purpose, the system for recording and reproducing an image by use of the image sheet is provided with a conveying system for conveying the image sheet. In order to minimize the size of the overall image recording and reproducing system or the portion of the apparatus incorporating the conveying system, the construction of the conveying system should desirably be simplified as much as possible. Further, in order to minimize the floor space occupied by the apparatus, the conveying system should desirably contain a vertical conveying portion in addition to or instead of a horizontal conveying portion so that the image sheet can be conveyed vertically. However, the conventional vertical conveying method requires a complicated mechanism for holding the image sheet on a conveying belt or the like, and is expensive. Further, in the conveying of the aforesaid image sheet, in order to assure the reproduction of a high quality image from the image sheet, it is desired to prevent the surface of the image sheet on the image recording layer side hereinafter referred to as the surface of the image sheet from being scratched due to contact with any member of the conveying system and from being deteriorated due to pressure applied to the surface of the image sheet. Further, in the system using the aforesaid image sheet, it is sometimes desired to conduct the image recording or reproduction with the surface of the image sheet facing transversely i.e. by positioning the image sheet vertically or facing down for the purPOse of minimizing the size of the whole system to match the construction of the recording and reproducing sections for recording an image on the image sheet and reproducing the image therefrom.For example, if it is possible to convey the image sheet along the lower side of a conveying drum or an endless belt with the surface of the image sheet facing down so that the image sheet can be exposed, for example, to a radiation from below in a radiation image recording apparatus, it becomes Possible to make the whole system compact and to freely design the construction of the system in various manners as desired. SU. RY OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the present invention is to provide a method of conveying an image sheet wherein the image sheet is conveyed without being scratched or pressed on the surface thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of conveying an image sheet wherein the image sheet can be conveyed vertically or with the surface thereof facing down along the lower side of a conveying means while the surface of the image sheet does not contact any part of the conveying system. The specific object of the present invention is to provide a method of conveying an image sheet wherein the conveying system can be simplified in construction and manimized in size The present invention provides a method of conveying an image sheet comprising a substrate layer and an image recording layer formed on said substrate layer, wherein either one of said substrate layer and a conveying means for conveying said image sheet is at least partially provided with a magnetic material or a magnet, and the other thereof is at least partially provided with a magnet, whereby at least a part of said substrate layer and at least a part of said conveying means are magnetically attracted to each other during conveying of said image sheet. The substrate layer may be in any form insofar as it can support the image layer, which may be a stimulable phosphor layer or photoconductive layer, and is at least partially provided with magnetic properties. For example, the substrate layer may be of the multi layer type comprising a non magnetic substrate such as an ordinary plastic film and a thin sheet made of a magnetic material such as iron, cobalt or nickel or a magnetic particle layer comprising a binder and magnetic particles dispersed therein, which is laid over at least a art of the non magnetic substrate. Alternatively, the substrate layer may be of the single layer type consisting of a magnetic material layer comprising a resin and magnetic particles dispersed therein.When a magnetic layer is provided at a part of the substrate, the magnetic layer may be positioned at an end of the image sheet or may be extended band wise over the entire length of the image sheet. By magnet is meant a material magnetically attracting a magnetic material. In general, the magnet should desirably exhibit a large coercive force to constitute a permanent magnet. However, it is also possible to employ an electromagnet and to excite the electromagnet by the application of an electric current only when the image sheet is to be conveyed. In the present invention, since either one of the substrate layer of the image sheet and the conveying means such as belt or drum is at least partially provided with a magnetic material or a magnet and the other thereof is at least partially provided with a magnet, the image sheet can be conveyed vertically or with the surface of the image sheet facing down along the lower side of the conveying means without using a special construction for holding the image sheet on the conveying means.Further, since the image sheet can be conveyed without the surface thereof contacting any part of the conveying system, there is no risk of the surface of the image sheet being scratched or adversely affected by a pressing force of holding rollers.Further, the construction of the conveying system can be simplified, and the whole apparatus can be made compact.

In Figure 1 showing an embodiment of the image sheet employed in the conveying method in accordance with the present invention, a stimulable phosphor sheet 1 comprises a substrate layer 12 and a stimulable phosphor layer 11 formed on the substrate layer 12. The substrate layer 12 comprises a substrate 12a and a magnetic material layer 12b composed of a macnetizable ferromagnetic material and overlaid on the substrate 12a. Figure 2 shows a stimulable phosphor sheet 2 having a substrate layer 22 of the single layer type. In the stimulable phosphor sheet 2, a stimulable phosphor layer 21 is formed on the magnetic material layer 22 comprising a resin and magnetic particles dispersed therein. The image sheet employed in the conveying method of the present invention is not limited to the stimulable phosphor sheets 1 and 2 as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The image sheet broadly embraces electrophotographic materials as described above, lithographic films for printing, conventionalX ray films, and any other type of image sheets. Namely, the image sheet embraces any sheet like material that is provided on the surface with an image recording layer for carrying an image recorded therein and reproducing a visible image therefrom by 11reproducing11 is broadly meant any processing conducted for ultimately reproducing the image into a visible image, such as transfer, read out, development or fixing and that should be prevented at least from being scratched on the surface. In the present invention, at least a part of the substrate layer 12 of the image sheet 1 or the substrate layer 22 of the image sheet 2 is provided with a magnetic material, and at least a part of the surface of the conveying means such as belt or drum for conveying the image sheet 1 or 2 is provided with a magnet. Alternatively, the substrate layer 12 or 22 is provided with a magnet, and the conveying means is provided with a magnetic material, or both substrate layer 12 or 22 and conveying means are provided with magnets. In this manner, the image sheet 1 or 2 is adhered to the surface of the conveying means by magnetic attraction and conveyed by the conveying means. When the surface of the conveying means, such as an endless belt or a drum, is provided with a magnetic material, a magnetic material layer comprising a binder and magnetic particles dispersed therein may be formed on the surface of the conveying means or a thin magnetic film may be formed thereon. The magnet maybe a permanent magnet obtained by magnetizing a ferromagnetic material having a large coercive force or an electromagnet having a small coercive force but capable of being temporarily excited. Therefore, the magnet can be obtained by forming a layer of a magnetizable or excitable magnetic material on the surface of the conveying means or on the substrate layer side of the image sheet and magnetizing or exciting the magnetic material layer. When a magnetic material or a magnet is provided on the surface of the conveying means, it need not be positioned over the entire surface of the conveying means. Thus, the magnetic material or the magnet may be positioned at least partially on the surface of the conveying means at intervals necessary for the magnetic material or the magnet to hold the image sheet. Further, the magnetic material or the magnet of the image sheet may be positioned at least partially in the same manner as described above. At any rate, the magnetic material or the magnet should be positioned on the image sheet side and the conveying means side in such a manner that the image sheet can be certainly adhered to the conveying means by magnetic attraction therebetween and conveyed by the conveying means. In the present invention, since either one of the image sheet and the conveying means is provided with a magnet and the other thereof is provided with a magnetic material or a magnet, the Image sheet is adhered to the conveying means by magnetic attraction acting therebetween and conveyed by the conveying means. Accordingly, the image sheet can be conveyed vertically or with the surface thereof facing down along the lower side of the conveying means without the sheet surface contacting any part of the conveying system. Figure 3 shows the condition of vertically conveying the image sheet by use of an endless belt. In Figure 3, an endless belt 3 is vertically installed around rollers 4 and 5 which are positioned one above the other. An image sheet 6 is vertically conveyed on the surface of the endless belt 3 with a surface 6a of the image sheet 6 facing out. In this manner, the image sheet 5 can be conveyed from a lower position to a higher position without the surface 6a coming into contact any part of the conveying system. In this method, since the number of rollers, guide plates or the like can be reduced compared with the conventional vertical conveying method using rollers opposed to each other for holding the image sheet, the construction of the conveying system can be simplified greatly and the apparatus can be made compact. Figure 4 shows the condition of conveying the image sheet with the surface thereof facing down along the lower side of the conveying means. In Figure 4, the image sheet 6 is adhered to a portion on the lower side 7a of an endless belt 7 with the surface 6a of the image sheet 6 facing down, and conveyed horizontally. This method is advantageous in that a light source for emitting light onto the image sheet can be positioned below the conveying means 7 or in the lower section of the apparatus, and the apparatus can be designed more freely as desired. Figure 5 shows a portion of a conveying system for feeding an image sheet 10 between two apparatus 8 and 9. In the conventional method, a sheet was delivered by using holding rollers. However, in the embodiment shown in Figure 5, since a large conveying force is obtained by magnetic attraction, it is not necessary to use holding rollers, and the image sheet 10 can be fed from the apparatus 8 to the apparatus 9 without scratching the surface of the image sheet 10 or deteriorating it by a pressing force. The embodiment of Figure 5 is advantageous particularly when the distance between a feed roller 8b of the apparatus 4 on the feeding side and. a receiving roller 9b of the apparatus 9 on the receiving side is half or more of the length of the image sheet 10. In Figure 5, the reference character 8a designates a feed guide plate on the side of the apparatus 8, and the reference character 9a denotes a receiving guide plate on the side of the apparatus 9. When the image sheet 10 is sufficiently rigid and the distance between the feed roller 8b and the receiving roller 9b is small, the guide plates 8a and 9a may be omitted. Further, when the image sheet 10 is greatly rigid and large magnetic attraction acts between the image sheet 10 and the conveying means, the guide plates 8a and 9a are unnecessary even if the feed roller 8b and the receiving roller 9b are spaced far apart from each other. When the image sheet 10 is not so rigid and large magnetic attraction acts between the image sheet 10 and the conveying means, there is a greater necessity for installing the guide plate 8a of the apparatus 8 on the feed side so that the image sheet 10 will not become entangled along the feed roller 8b.
