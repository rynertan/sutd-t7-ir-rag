# FLOATING RESCUE APPARATUS

## Abstract
Rescue apparatus for rescuing a person in water has a body 14 with inflatable pontoons 15, 16 interconnected by upwardly bowed inflatable upper connectors 18, 19 and downwardly bowed lower connectors 21, 22 to provide an opening between the pontoons to receive the person. Thrusters 33, 34 cooperate with the lower connector 21 below the surface, and receive power and control signals through a cable 36 to control move ment of the apparatus on the surface. A net enclosure 38 encloses the pontoons and connectors and has an opening 40 adjacent one end to receive the person. The upper portion of the apparatus is lighter than the lower portion, to provide a low center of gravity for self righting if the apparatus becomes inadvertently inverted, this being assisted by the inflatable upper connectors which are shaped to fit closely adjacent each other to reduce storage volume of the collapsed apparatus when the pontoons 15, 16 are deflated. The apparatus is designed for storage within a helicopter, and can be retrieved from the water by a helicopter with a lifting line connected to a ring 47 and positioned so as to permit relatively easy unloading of the person from the apparatus into the helicopter. The folded or collapsed apparatus can be thrown onto water, and it inflates and erects automatically without manual intervention.
