# Reagent for measuring direct bilirubin by enzymatic method and method for measurement thereof.

## Abstract
Reagent for the measurement of direct bilirubin com prising a buffer solution having a pH range of 3.5 to 4.5 which contains bilirubin oxidase, preferably in the form of a test kit consisting essentially of i a buffer solution having a pH range of 3.5 to 4.5, ii a a lyophilized bilirubin oxidase, ii b a buffer solution for dissolving the lyophilized bilirubin ox idase, and iii a standard serum containing a prescribed amount of bilirubin, and a method for measurement of direct bilirubin by using the reagent. The reagent and method are useful for diagnosis of various diseases, for example, various hepatic diseases e.g. jaundice and cholepathia.
