# Filler for heat sensitive recording paper.

## Abstract
Particulate material suitable for use as a filler for the heat sensitive recording layer of heat sensitive recording paper comprises finely divided amorphous silica having a BET specific surface area of 10 to 100 m² g and a bulk den sity of 0.14 to 0.30 g cc, said finely divided amorphous silica having such a secondary particle size distribution that sec ondary particles having a size smaller than 4 µm, as mea sured by the centrifugal precipitation method, constitute at least 90 by weight of the total particles. A composite filler for the heat sensitive recording layer of heat sensitive re cording paper comprises amorphous silica having the same BET specific surface area and bulk density and such a sec ondary particle size distribution that secondary particles having size smaller than 4 µm, as measured by the centrifu gal precipitation method, constitute at least 70 by weight of the total particles, and fine particles of amino resin ob tained by condensing substantially equimolar amounts of a functional amino group containing component and a form aldehyde component in the presence of a catalyst and which has an oil absorption of 20 to 90 ml 100 g and a spe cific surface area smaller than 20 m² g, at a weight ratio of amorphous silica amino resin particles of from 90 10 to 10 90.
