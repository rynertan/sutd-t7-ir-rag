# Electrical resistance measurement.

## Abstract
Monitoring the change of resistance of a test element by passing a current through the element in series with a stan dard element, comparing the voltage across the test element with a standard voltage to produce a signal dependent on the difference between the voltages, feeding said signal to a cur rent modifier so as to vary the current to maintain the voltage across the test element constant, and monitoring the change in voltage across the standard element.
