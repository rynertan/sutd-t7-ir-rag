# A method for producing a clad alloy article and an assembly for use therein.

## Abstract
A method for producing an alloy article, such as a valve component 14 , and an assembly for use therewith. The article is produced by hot isostatic compacting wherein a lining 28 of prealloyed powdered metal of an alloy com position different than that of the remainder of the article is confined on a surface of an internal passage or cavity 24 in the article. A solid lining element 30,32 is provided contiguous with at least a portion of the powdered metal lining 28 on the surface of said internal passage 24 , the lining element 30,32 being of an alloy also different from that of the remainder of the article. The powdered metal and solid lining element 30,32 are heated and then hot isostatic ally pressed to densify and bond the powdered metal and the lining element 30,32 to the surface of the internal passage 24 of the article to provide a clad lining of dissimilar metal.
