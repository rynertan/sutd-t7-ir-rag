# Polyamino bis maleimide prepolymer, its manufacture, its use in manufacturing laminates.

## Abstract
A polyamino bis maleimide prepolymer solution is obtained by the reaction of N,N 4,4 diphenyl methane bis maleimide 4,4 diaminodiphenyl methane in a molar ratio of from 1 0.25 to 1 0.4 in an alkyleneglycol monoalkyl ether as a solvent at elevated temperatures. A substrate can be impre gnated with this solution to form a prepreg, which can be laminated to form a heat resistant optionally copper clad laminate.
