# Dry etching method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A dry etching method for performing anisotropic etching on a semiconductor substrate 12 by employing an etching gas together with a film forming gas while irradiating light or an X ray on the semiconductor subatrate 12 . In this method at least one of the etching gas or film forming gas is excited in a separate chamber 16 before being introduced into an etching chamber 11 . A dry etching apparatus for performing the above dry etching method is also proposed.
