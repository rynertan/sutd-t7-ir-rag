# Method of refining molten steel by arc process.

## Abstract
Molten steel 6 is tapped from a converter into a refining ladle 2 and ore such as Nb₂O₃ ore is charged into the molten steel 6 . Then, the interior of the refining ladle 2 is held in an inert gas atmosphere. A reducing agent such as an Aℓ reducing agent is charged into the molten steel. Elec trodes 10 are dipped in slag 8 on the molten steel to form an arc therebetween so as to heat the molten steel with an arc. The ore is reduced by the reducing agent, so that a metallic component of the ore is added to the molten steel. On the other hand, carbon electrodes each having a gas supply port at its lower end can be used to inject an ore powder or particles from the injection ports to the arc between the electrodes and molten steel. The ore is reduced by electrode carbon with arc heat, so that a desired component is added to the molten steel.
