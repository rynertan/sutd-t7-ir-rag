## Abstract
A blank e.g. of paperboard or cardboard, for forming a tray type container comprises a generally rectangular first central panel, having opposite pairs of second, third panels, fourth and fifth panels 14A, 16A, 18A, 20A connected with the four opposite sides through folding lines a, b c, d and each having two end flaps 181A, 183A 201A, 203A parallel to the second and third panels and sixth and seventh panels 22A, 24A connected with a remaining side of said fourth and fifth panels through folding lines e, f respectively and each having two corner flaps, 211A, 223A 241, 243A , each of which corner flaps is connected also with a respective side of the flap of said fourth or fifth panel through a folding line n, m q, r and has another folding line s, t u, v therein. To make a container from the blank, the 2nd to 5th panels 14A 20A are folded up vertical as side panels, the 6th panel 22A is folded, which infolds the end flaps 181A, 183A , so that they overlap outside the 2nd and 3rd side panels and are fixed thereto with adhesive, and likewise the 7th panel 24A . The resultant tray has 4 sides and two horizontal inturned strips formed by the 6th and 7th panels. The 2nd and 3rd side panels could be made shorter in height than the other 4th and 5th side panels. The container is used for storage, display and transport of tins or other packages for shops and has good strength. To remove tightly packed packages, the inturned strips 22A, 24A are pulled up and can then be returned to position. To check the contents in a stack the adhered flaps can be pulled away.
