# Process for preparing rhodium I carbonyl complexes.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of rhodium I carbonyltriorganophosphorus mono β ketoenolate complexes which comprises reacting a halocarbonylbis triorganophosphorus rhodium I com plex, a β ketoenolate source and an oxygen transfer agent. The complexes so produced are useful as pre cursors for catalysts in hydroformylation processes.
