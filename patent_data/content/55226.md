## Description
Scented leads for pencilsThe present invention relates to new scented leads for pencils, processes for the preparation thereof and pencils which hold said new leads as writing part.More particularly, the present invention provides, in one aspect thereof, new leads for pencils which are endowed with substances which are able to exhale scents.The invention also provides, in another aspect, a novel process for preparing these new leads, which comprises giving to leads said substances which are able to exhale scents through immersion into the grease bath.Finally, the invention also provides penoils which have said new leads as writing part.Only known attempts for giving to pencils peculiar scents were till now limited to embodiments which comprise to incorporate said substances which are able to exhale scents, substanoes which will be called hereinafter flavours for the sake of brevity, into the extern31 covering of pencils. However the limits of that technical solution are apparent as a matter of fact it is not possible to transfer the scent to the graphic mark, the writing or the drawing made by means of that kind of pencils.It has been now surprisingly found, and this is an object of the present invention, that it is possible to overcone that disadvantage by means of leads for pencils endowed witz flavours . Said flavours are given to leads, and tis is another object of the present invention, through the immersion into th grease bath. Said grease bath conveniently consists in a mixture of two waxes, one having drop point in the range from 55.700 to 59.700, the other having drop point in the range from 85.200 to 89.200, and flavour , which is generally an essential oil per cent ratios of bath ingredients can be varied according to the following ratios lower drop point wax 30 56 higher drop point wax 15 25 flavour 30 50 Lower drop point wax advantageously is a vegetable wax having drop point 57.700 and higher drop point wax advantageously is carnauba wax having drop point 87.2003 the flavour usefully consists of natural or synthetic essential mixtures which are normally used in perfumery and are free from mutagenic substances and natural flavours together with inert and non toxic carriers, provided that said flavour is resistant to temperatures which are higher than 110 C. The flavour is advantageously carried by ethylenglycol and benzyl alcohol and it is resistant to a temperature from 11000 to 120 C.For example, and without any limiting intention, a list of flavours which have the above mentioned characteristics is given hereinbelow all the flavours are produced by the firm t Variati Lavanda K50F lavender , Sandalo 78182 sandal , Rosa 3009 rose , Violetta 78191 1 sweet violet , Giacinto 78191 hyacinth , Tiglio 78134 T lime , Banana 7992 banana , Arancio 78005 orange Fra gola 7982 strawberry , Mirtillo 7987 bilberry , Peppermint 78187, Liquirizia 7920 liquorice . Anyway, it is understood that any flavour having the above mentioned characteristics can be used for the exploitation of the present invention.Advantageously, per cent ratios of grease bath ingredienks can be varied according to the following ratios vegetable wax with drop point 57.700 38 42 carnauba wax with drop point 87.200 19 21 flavour 38 42 More advantageously, per cent ratios of grease bath ingredients are vegetable wax with drop point 57.700 40 carnauba wax with drop point 87.200 20 flavour 40 moreover, according to another aspect of the present invention, pigments which give to leads colours are selected so as to avoid transfers to the grease bath which holds the flavour , in order to have a final product of satisfying quality.Therefore, said pigments are advantageously selected among pigments which show a fats resistance higher than 3, said fats resistanoe being measured by means of the international scale going from 1 to 5 more advantageously, said pigments show a fats resistanoe of 5.For example, and without any limiting intention, pigments which possess the above mentioned characteristics can be easily obtained from the firms Acna , Basf , Bayer .According to the invention, the mixture for the leads can be carried out by wet mixing utilizing suitable fillers, dispersants, binding agents, lubricants, anti fermentative agents and pigments together with mioronized kaolin.According to an embodiment of the present invention, for prepar ing the mixture for the leads English as well as French mioroniz ed kaolin, as both show suitable characteristics of greasiness, air sifted talc as filler, methylcellulose as binding agent and, moreover, Riccadil TPL Ã§L , non silicone dispersant produced by Winthropp , Lunadip K , ceresin type lubricant produced by Spica , Dowcil anti fermentative agent produced by Dow Chemical and pigments for obtaining the desired colour are used.All those materials can be used in percentages from 40 to 72 for the micronized kaolin, from 2 to 26 for the air sifted talo, from 2 to 4 for the methylcellulose, from 1 to 2 for the Riccadil TPL AL from 1 to 4 for the Lunadip K from 0 to 1 for the Dowcil and from 4 to 32 for pigments. The mixing of raw materials is carried out in a kneader, after adding 35 of water it is a hot mixing and it is carried out at reduced pressure, in order to lower the water percentage to about 25 .When the moisture content attains the desired value, the mixture is passed through a multi die by means of a press, in order to increase its degree of homogeneity.So obtained strings are converted into cylindrical cakes by means of a vacuum press the resulting cakes are put into a draw plate for extrusion of actual leads0Leads, after extrusion, are dried in an oven, at a temperature from 130 C to 140 C. After staying in the desiccation oven, leads are dipped into the grease bath, which is composed of vegetable wax with drop point 57.700, in the percentage of 40 , of carnauba wax with drop point 87.200, in the percentage of 20 , and of the selected 1flavour , in the percentage of 40 . The time of dipping into the grease bath, which has its best fluidity at 110 C, can be varied according to colour to be coupled with the selected flavour that time is from 1.5 to 3 hours.Leads are hence ready.f or the following stages, which are the usual stages for obtaining a pencil when utilizing an usual colour ed lead, namely sticking, shaping, coating and finishing of the wooden covering.According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, colour scent couplings are those reportedhereinbelow, in Table I.

The mixture is then cooled and, in order to increase its homogeneity, it is passed through a multi die by means of a press the so obtained strings are converted into cylindrical cakes by means of a vacuum press the obtained cakes give the actual leads by means of extrusion.After drying in an oven at 135 C, the obtained leads are dipped into a grease bath for a period of three hours the grease bath has the temperature of about 1100C and the following composition vegetable wax with drop point 57.700 40 Carnauba wax with drop point 87.200 20 Rosa 3009 Variati production 40 After extraction from the bath and after cooling, leads are ready for following steps of sticking, shaping, coating and finishing of the wooden covering those steps give the accomplished pencil.
