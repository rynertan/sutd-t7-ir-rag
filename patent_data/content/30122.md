# Ground effect vehicle.

## Abstract
A wheeled vehicle has an undertray shaped to form a venturi duct with a road or like surface over which the vehicle moves, the undertray being carried in substantially fixed relationship with the wheels, so that the vehicle chassis or body can move relative to the wheels without substantial alteration of the shape of the venturi duct. The undertray can comprise the lower wall of a sheel enclosing the vehicle body or chassis.
