## Description
The present invention relates to automobile signal receiving apparatus including an antenna system for detecting broadcast radio frequency signals, and a signal receiver for receiving detected signals. Antenna systems are essential for modern automobiles to receive various wave signals such as radio waves, TV waves, and car telephone waves. Antenna systems also are very important for transmission and reception of wave signals in citizen band transceivers. There is generally known a rod or pole antenna which projects outwardly from the vehicle body. The pole antenna exhibits good reception performance but is always an obstruction from the viewpoint of vehicle body design. The pole antenna is also subject to being damaged or stolen and further produces an unpleasant noise when the automobile is running at high speeds. Recently, the number of frequency bands for broadcast or communication wave signals has increased, and thus the number of antennas has to be correspondingly increased. This counteracts the aesthetic concepts in automobile body design and also raises the problem that electrical interference between the antennas degrades reception performance. Some attempts have been made to eliminate or conceal pole antennas. One of such attempts is that an antenna wire is applied to a rear window glass of an automobile body. There has been made a proposal in which an antenna system is adapted to detect surface currents induced on the vehicle body by radio waves. Although this proposal is apparently positive and efficient, experiments showed that it could not effectively be used. One of the reasons why surface currents induced on the vehicle body by radio waves could not efficiently be utilized in the prior art is that the level of the induced surface currents is not as high as expected. The prior art utilized surface currents induced on the roof panel of the vehicle body. However, outputs of sufficient level to be utilized could not be detected. A second reason is that an increased level of noise is included in the surface currents on the vehicle body. The noise mainly results from the operation of ignition and regulator systems of the automobile engine. The noise cannot be eliminated unless the engine is stopped. One of the proposals for overcoming such problems in the prior art is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Sho 53 22418 in which an electrical insulator is formed on the vehicle body at a location where the surface currents concentrate. Surface currents flowing between the opposite ends of the insulator are detected directly by a sensor. Although this proposal can detect practicable signals which are superior in S N ratio, it requires a pick up which must be mounted in a notch formed in a portion of the vehicle body. This is not acceptable in mass production. Another proposal is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication Sho 53 34826 in which an antenna system includes a pick up coil used to detect surface currents flowing on a pillar in the vehicle body. However, the pick up coil must be located adjacent to the pillar in a direction perpendicular to the length thereof. Such an arrangement is not practical and still does not provide practicable antenna outputs. In the prior art, moreover, the resonance frequency of the antenna itself is fixed. When reception is to be carried out over wider frequency bands, a plurality of antenna units are required. Furthermore, the prior art antenna system is increased in size with its associated impedance matching circuit and pre amplifier. This limits the locations at which the antenna system can desirably be located on the vehicle body. The prior art antenna systems were mainly intended to receive AM band radio waves. Accordingly, antenna systems of such a type as to detect surface currents on the vehicle body could not provide good reception characteristics since the wavelength of AM radio waves is too large. The present invention is aimed at this dependence on frequency and it has been found that the reception of surface currents on the vehicle body can very effectively be attained by limiting the radio waves to be received to waves belonging to frequency bands above FM frequency bands i.e., above 50 MHz . An object of the present invention is to provide automobile signal receiving apparatus having an antenna system suitable for use in small sized automobiles, which has wide band capabilities and which can efficiently detect currents induced on the vehicle body by broadcast radio frequency signals. US A 2520986 and DE A 1949828 each describe an automobile signal receiving apparatus comprising The present invention is characterized in that US A 4339827 describes a television antenna system including a loop antenna, a variable capacitance diode connected to the antenna, and control means associated with the receiver to control the capacitance of the variable capacitance diode so that the resonant frequency is substantially identical to a tuned frequency selected at the receiver. This is not an automobile antenna system. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings. Figure 10 shows that when external waves W such as radio waves and the like pass through a vehicle body B of electrically conductive metal, surface currents I having an intensity corresponding to that of the external waves are induced on the vehicle body at various locations. The present invention aims to utilize the external wave signals which belong to relatively high frequency bands having frequencies above 50 MHz, such as FM wave bands, TV wave bands and others. The present invention includes a pick up device located on the vehicle body at a location wherein the density of induced surface currents is higher with less noise. To determine the distribution of surface currents, a simulation is made by using a computer and also the actual intensity of the surface currents is measured at various locations on the vehicle. A probe is utilized to measure the intensity of surface currents on the vehicle body. The probe is constructed and functions in accordance with the same principle as that of a high frequency pick up device which is to be located on the vehicle body at a desired location as will be described. The probe is moved over the entire surface of the vehicle body with its orientation being changed at the respective locations to measure the surface currents. Figure 11 shows such a probe P which comprises a casing 10 of electrically conductive material and a loop coil 12 located within the casing 10 so that the loop coil 12 will be protected from any undesirable external waves. The casing 10 is provided with an opening 10a through which a portion of the loop coil 12 is externally exposed. The exposed portion of the loop coil 12 is positioned in close proximity to the surface of the vehicle body B to detect a magnetic flux formed by surface currents which are induced on the vehicle body by external waves. The loop coil 12 is electrically connected to the casing 10 by a short circuiting line 14. The output terminal 16 of the loop coil 12 is electrically connected to a conductive core 20 in a coaxial cable 18. The loop coil 12 also includes a capacitor 22 for causing the frequency of the loop coil 12 to resonate at a desired frequency to be measured. As a result, the efficiency of the pick up device can be increased. When such a probe P is moved along the surface of the vehicle body B and angularly rotated at the respective measurement points, the distribution and orientation of the surface currents induced on the vehicle body can accurately be determined. Referring again to Figure 11, the output of the probe P is amplified by a high frequency voltage amplifier 24. The amplified output voltages are then measured by means of a high frequency voltage measuring device 26. These output voltages from the loop coil 12 are also recorded by means of an X Y recorder 28 as values of surface currents on the vehicle body at various locations. The input of the X Y recorder 28 also receives signals from a potentiometer 30, which signals are indicative of the respective locations on the vehicle body. As a result, one can determine the level of surface high frequency currents at each of the locations on the vehicle body. Referring now to Figures 1 to 4, there is shown a first embodiment of the present invention in which a high frequency pick up device 38 is mounted on a roof panel 32 at a location adjacent to its rearward edge. In Figure 2, the roof panel 32 is shown to be exposed. The roof panel 32 is made of a metal material and has its marginal portion forming a rear window frame 34 which supports a rear window glass 36. This illustrated embodiment includes a high frequency pick up device 38 spaced from the outer margin of the rear window frame 34 within a range of ℓ 12 10 ³λ m where λ is the wavelength of a wave signal being received measured in metric units. As is seen from Figure 1, the high frequency pick up device 38 comprises a casing 40 of a metal material for shielding any external magnetic flux and a loop antenna 42 located within the casing 40. The pick up device 38 forms an electromagnetic coupling type pick up device having a structure similar to that of the aforementioned probe used to measure the distribution of surface currents on the vehicle body. Figure 3 shows the cross section of the portion of the roof panel 32 in which the high frequency pick up device 38 is mounted. The roof panel 32 includes a roof panel portion 44 at an end of which the rear window frame 34 is fixedly mounted. The roof panel portion 44 supports the rear window glass 36 through fastener means 46 and seal means 48 which are air tightly adhered to each other by adhesive material 50. A molding 52 is mounted between the roof panel portion 44 and the rear window glass 36. The loop antenna 42 of the high frequency pick up device 38 is positioned in close proximity to the marginal edge of the rear window frame 34 by locating the casing 40 in an opening 34a formed in the rear window frame 34. As is seen from Figure 3, the casing 40 is provided with an opening 40a through which one of the longitudinal sides of the loop antenna 42 is externally exposed and positioned in close proximity to the opening edge of the rear window frame 34. Thus, a magnetic flux formed by surface high frequency currents flowing on the marginal edge of the rear window frame 34 can positively be caught by the loop antenna 42 in the casing 40. On the contrary, the other external magnetic fluxes can positively be blocked by the shielding casing 40. In this manner, surface currents induced on the vehicle body can efficiently be detected by the high frequency pick up device 38. To positively position the casing 40 of the high frequency pick up device 38 relative to the rear window frame 34, as shown in Figure 4, L shaped brackets 54 and 56 are respectively connected with the opposite ends of the casing 40 by any suitable fastening means such as bolts or the like. Each of the brackets 54 and 56 is fastened to the rear window frame 34 as by screws. The casing 40 of the high frequency pick up device 38 contains circuitry 58 connected to the loop antenna 42. The circuitry 58 includes various circuits for processing detected signals, such as a matching circuit, pre amplifier and others. The detected signals of high frequency are fed out through a coaxial cable 60 and then transmitted to various built in receivers such as radio receivers, TV receivers and others. The circuitry 58 receives power and control signals through a cable 62. The loop antenna 42 is in the form of a single winding antenna which is covered with an insulating coating such that the antenna can electrically be insulated from and located in close contact with the rear window frame 34. Thus, the magnetic flux formed by the surface currents can more efficiently intersect the loop antenna 42. After the high frequency pick up device 38 has been mounted on the roof panel 32 and particularly the rear window frame 34, a roof trim 64 is mounted on the roof panel. An edge molding 66 is then mounted between the roof trim 64 and the rear window frame 34. In the illustrated embodiment, the exposed portion of the loop antenna 42 through the casing 40 is spaced from the marginal edge of the rear window frame 34 within a range represented by ℓ 12 10 ³λ m . Consequently, waves belonging, for example, to FM radio band having a frequency of 80 MHz can be detected from the surface currents flowing on the vehicle body at the marginal portion of the rear window frame 34. Since the orientation of the flowing currents is along the marginal portion of the rear window frame 34, the longitudinal side of the loop antenna 46 is disposed parallel to the marginal edge of the rear window frame 34. The first embodiment of the present invention provides a very superior automobile antenna system capable of receiving waves of higher frequency bands without need of any externally projecting portion since its high frequency pick up device electromagnetically detects the surface currents flowing on the marginal portion of the vehicle body and particularly the marginal portion of the roof panel. The present invention is further characterized in that the aforementioned circuitry 58 includes a varactor diode 70 for permitting the resonance frequency of the high frequency pick up device including the loop antenna 42 to be controlled. As will be apparent, the antenna system is controlled such that the resonance frequency of the high frequency pick up device 38 is matched to the tuned frequency of a built in receiver by selecting the capacitance of the varactor diode 70 under the influence of the above tuned frequency of the built in receiver. Figure 5 is a circuit diagram showing a state in which the loop antenna 42 of the electromagnetic coupling type high frequency pick up device 38 in the first embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 4 is electrically connected to said varactor diode 70 and a pre amplifier and also in which the varactor diode 70 is electrically connected to the built in receiver. In Figure 5, the loop antenna 42 is electrically connected in series with a capacitor C1, the varactor diode 70 and a capacitor C2 with its resonance frequency being determined by the series capacity of these components. The output of the high frequency pick up device 38 is fed from one end of the capacitor C1 and also the anode terminal of the varactor diode 70. With respect to the output of the pick up device 38, the desired impedance conversion and high frequency amplification are carried out by the pre amplifier located adjacent to the pick up device 38 as said circuitry 58. As shown, the pre amplifier includes a band pass filter BPF which can select only a desired frequency band and eliminate other signals including noise signals. The detected and amplified signals are then subjected to impedance conversion at an impedance converting circuit comprising resistors and capacitors. The signals are further amplified with respect to frequency and then supplied to the built in receiver through the coaxial cable 60. These components including the pre amplifier are supplied with power voltage through the cable 62. The level of the detected signals in the pre amplifier is thus maximum at the resonance frequency of the high frequency pick up device 38. This resonance frequency can be matched to a desired frequency to be received by changing the capacity of the varactor diode 70. Therefore, the antenna system can be reduced in size and yet efficiently receive waves. In the illustrated embodiment, the pre amplifier also includes a neon tube NL functioning to protect semiconductor elements from high voltages due to lightning and static electricity. The capacitance of the varactor diode 70 may be changed when a predetermined control voltage is applied to the cathode side of the varactor diode 70, the applied control voltage being controlled in association with the tuned frequency of the built in receiver. Referring to Figure 5, there is shown part of a built in receiver 72 in which the other end of said coaxial cable 60 is electrically connected to the antenna terminal 74 of the receiver 72. The antenna terminal 74 is then connected to the subsequent receiving circuit through a tuning circuit 76 and capacitor 78. The tuning circuit 76 is adapted to select any tuned frequency by changing the inductance of the coil or the capacitance of the capacitor. In the illustrated embodiment, such a selected frequency is controlled and selected by a tuned frequency control circuit 79 and also displayed at a display 80. In the present embodiment the tuned frequency control voltage from the tuned frequency control circuit 79 in the receiver 72 is supplied to the cathode side of the varactor diode 70 through a variable resistor 84 and a resistor 86. In such a manner, the varactor diode 70 will receive a control voltage corresponding to the tuned frequency selected by the tuning circuit 76. When a desired frequency to be received is selected at the receiver 72, the resonance frequency of the pick up device 38 is varied to match said tuned frequency. Therefore, the small sized antenna system constructed in accordance with the present invention can efficiently receive wave signals. Referring to Figure 6, there is shown a further embodiment of the high frequency pick up device used in an automobile antenna system according to the present invention. The embodiment of Figure 6 comprises a loop antenna 342 electrically connected in series with a varactor diode 370 for receiving FM waves, a varactor diode 372 for receiving VHFTV waves and a varactor diode 374 for receiving UHFTV waves which are also connected in series with each other in a circuitry 358. One of these varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374 is selected and controlled by a tuned frequency from a built in receiver, which will be described, such that the resonance frequency of the high frequency pick up device will be matched to the tuned frequency of the receiver. Figure 7 shows a circuit wherein the loop antenna 342 of the electromagnetic coupling type high frequency pick up device 338 shown in Figure 6 is electrically connected to the above three diodes 370, 372 and 374 and a pre amplifier and wherein the three varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374 are electrically connected to the receiver. As seen from Figure 7, the loop antenna 342 is electrically connected in series with a capacitor C1, three series connected varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374 for respectively receiving FM, VHFTV and UHFTV waves, and a capacitor C2. Thus, the loop antenna 342 will have a resonance frequency which is determined from the series capacity level of the varactor diodes and capacitors C1, C2 to which a control voltage is applied. The output of the high frequency pick up device 338 is fed from the opposite ends of the capacitor C1 and then subjected to the desired impedance conversion and high frequency amplification at a pre amplifier which is located near the pick up device 338 as the aforementioned circuitry 358. As shown, the pre amplifier includes a band pass filter BPF which can select a desired frequency band and eliminate other signals including noise. The high frequency signals so detected and amplified are then subjected to an impedance conversion and a further high frequency amplification at an impedance converting circuit which comprises resistors and capacitors. Thereafter, these signals are supplied to the receiver through a coaxial cable 360. The pre amplifier receives a power voltage through a cable 362. A predetermined control voltage is selectively applied to each of the varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374 at its cathode side to vary the capacitance thereof. The applied voltage is controlled in association with the tuned frequency of the receiver. Figure 7 shows part of the receiver which includes an antenna terminal electrically connected to the other end of the coaxial cable 360. The antenna terminal is electrically connected to the subsequent receiving circuit through a tuning circuit 376. The primary part of the tuning circuit 376 comprises a FM tuner control micro computer 378 generating FM tuning control output voltages used to receive FM radio waves 76 90 MHz and a TV tuner control micro computer 380 producing VHF Lo tuning control output voltages used to receive VHFTV waves having lower frequencies 90 108 MHz , VHF Hi tuning control output voltages used to receive VHFTV waves having higher frequencies 170 220 MHz and UHF tuning control output voltages used to receive UHFTV waves. The FM tuning control voltages, VHF Lo tuning control voltages, VHF Hi tuning control voltages and UHF tuning control voltages are adjusted respectively by variable resistors R9, R10, R11 and R12. By actuating switch means 382 in the receiver, a control voltage will be applied to the cathode side of each of the varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374. When a switch 382a in the switch means 382 is shifted to the upper contact, an FM tuning control voltage is applied to the varactor diode 370 for receiving FM radio waves. When the switch 382a is shifted to the lower contact, a VHF Lo tuning control voltage is applied to the varactor diode 70. When a switch 382b is closed, a VHF Hi tuning control voltage is applied to the varactor diode 372 for receiving VHFTV waves. When a switch 382c is closed, a UHF tuning control voltage is applied to the varactor diode 374 for receiving UHFTV waves. If the loop antenna 342 has dimensions of about 2 cm 5 cm, its self inductance L is equal to about 50 µH. Therefore, the range of change in the capacitance of each of the varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374 is as follows. The varactor diode 370 for receiving FM waves For each of the frequency bands, the capacitance of the corresponding one of the varactor diodes 370, 372 and 374 is thus changed by the tuning control voltage from the corresponding one of the FM and TV tuner control micro computers 378 and 380. As a result, the resonance frequency of the antenna will coincide with any selected receiver frequency. In such an arrangement, the single loop antenna 342 can efficiently receive waves belonging to broader frequency bands from FM bands to UHFTV bands since the frequency bands are separately selected. The embodiments illustrated in Figures 1 and 6 comprise circuitry 58 358 including the impedance matching and amplifier circuits which is contained within the casing 40 340 of the high frequency pick up device 38 338 . The output impedance of the amplifier circuit is matched to the characteristic impedance of the coaxial antenna cable 60 360 . This results in a very efficient processing of signals. Such an arrangement is shown in Figure 8 which does not show a varactor diode . As seen from Figure 8, a loop antenna 642 is electrically connected in series with capacitors 670 and 672. Detected signals taken from the opposite ends of one of the capacitors 670 are subjected to an impedance matching at an impedance matching circuit 674 and further to a high frequency amplification at the subsequent high frequency amplifier circuit 676. The amplified signals are then supplied to a built in receiver through a coaxial cable 660. As seen from Figure 8, all the loop antenna 642, impedance matching circuit 674 and high frequency amplifying circuit 676 are housed within a casing 640. Feeble signals detected by the loop antenna 642 are suitably processed within the casing 640 and supplied to the receiver through the coaxial cable 660. Therefore, waves can efficiently be received by the receiver with less attenuation. Figure 9 shows the details of the circuit shown in Figure 8 which will be described below. The impedance matching circuit 674 includes a band pass filter 678 and a discharge tube 680. Voltages detected by the loop antenna 642 and fed through a capacitor 670 are supplied to the input of the band pass filter 678 with the output thereof being connected to a parallel circuit consisting of the discharge tube 680 and a capacitor C3. The discharge tube 680 serves to protect the circuit from external power due to static electricity, lightning and others. The band pass filter 678 causes the loop antenna 642 to be subjected to the impedance matching. The signals subjected to the impedance matching are then subjected to a high frequency amplification at the high frequency amplifier circuit 676 which includes two stage connected transistors Q1 and Q2 the output of which is connected to a receiver through a coaxial antenna cable 660. The circuitry shown in Figure 9 comprises inductances L1, L2 defining a peaking coil, resistors R2, R3 for stabilizing the operation of the transistor Q1, bias resistors R5, R6 and bypass capacitors C3, C9. The conductive sheath of the coaxial cable 660 is grounded to define a grounding line for the impedance matching and high frequency amplifying circuits 674 and 676 which are housed within the casing. The output impedance of the high frequency amplifying circuit 676 is set to coincide with the characteristic impedance of the coaxial antenna cable 660 so that a good matching between the high frequency amplifying circuit 676 and the coaxial cable 660 will be obtained. Thus, feeble signals detected by the loop antenna 642 can be subjected to the desired impedance matching and high frequency amplification in the casing which is a detecting location. These circuits themselves are miniaturized sufficiently to be housed within the casing 640. The signals fed through the coaxial cable 660 can be stabilized and effectively supplied to the receiver. It will be apparent from the foregoing that for waves belonging to relatively high frequency bands such as above FM frequency bands, a radio wave receiving antenna is positioned on a given location and particularly the marginal edge portion of the vehicle body to detect surface high frequency currents induced thereon and that the resonance frequency of the antenna is controlled to coincide with the tuned frequency of the receiver by the use of varactor diodes. Consequently, broadcast waves can efficiently be detected by the antenna with less noise without any externally projecting portion. Impedance matching and high frequency amplifying circuits defining a pre circuit are housed together within the casing of a high frequency pick up device. Accordingly, the antenna system can be miniaturized and effectively detect the waves with less attenuation and without any externally exposed portion.
