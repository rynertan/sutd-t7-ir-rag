# Radiation resistant color television camera.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a television camera having good color re producibility which is secured to be maintained for a long time even in an atmosphere of high radiation, and in which the degree of deterioration in each color component signal due to radiation exposure is detected and the amplification degree of each color component signal is corrected in ac cordance with the detected degree of deterioration so as to make the color reproducibility come back to the state before radiation exposure.
