# Fluid shear coupling.

## Abstract
A fluid shear coupling is disclosed herein which comprises a coupling disc received within a housing. The coupling disc and housing are mounted for coaxial rotation, and the coupling disc is connectable to a drive pulley assembly for driving the coupling disc in rotation. The coupling disc includes a pair of annular flanges extending axially in opposite directions from the periphery of the disc. The flanges define inside and outside working surfaces with the inside and outside working surfaces including helical grooves for moving a fluid received against those surfaces in a predetermined direction. The housing includes working portions closely conforming to the working surfaces of the flanges. A fluid reservoir is defined by the housing and is operable to move a working fluid into the space between the flanges and the working portions of the housing to provide variable coupling of the housing with the coupling disc.
