# APPARATUS FOR REGENERATING ORIGINAL SIGNALS

## Abstract
An apparatus for regenerating original signals compris ing means for introducing a first signal that is produced as an original signal passes through a system that cuts off pre determined frequencies a first circuit means 30 which pro duces a third signal obtained on an open loop responsive to said first signal and a second signal which is regenerated from a signal of a predetermined frequency that is cut off by said system and a second circuit means 12 which regener ates the original signal by converting said third signal into a binary signal.
