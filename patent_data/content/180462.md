# Automobile antenna system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an automobile antenna system capable of receiving radio waves without need of an ex ternally projecting part such as a pole type antenna externally exposed from the vehicle body, the automobile antenna sys tem including a high frequency pick up disposed on the mar ginal portion of an engine hood or trunk lid on the vehicle body such that the length of the pick up is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the engine marginal edge of the engine hood or trunk lid, whereby surface high frequency currents induced on the vehi cle body by radio waves and concentrically flowing on the mar ginal portion of the engine hood or trunk lid can be detected by the pick up.
