## Description
TITLE REACTOR FOR GASIFYING SOLID FUEL DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a reactor for gasifying solid fuel. It has been proposed for some time to gasify coal, wood and other products to produce a combustible gas from good fuel, or indeed from waste material. One form of reactor for effecting this gasification includes a chamber having a generally vertically extending axis, an inlet for the solid fuel in the upper part of the chamber, air introduction nozzles for bringing air into the chamber to effect pyrolisis and oxidation and a gas outlet and an ash outlet both arranged towards the bottom of the chamber. Such a construction can be made to operate perfectly satisfactorily with many types of fuel. However, if the solid fuel which is introduced is of a particulate nature, and in certain other circumstances also, there will be a significant amount of solid material in suspension in the product gas. Various means have been provided to attempt to remove these solid particles but they are either very expensive or unsatisfactory. It is now proposed, according to the present invention, for the gas outlet to include a plurality of circumferentially spaced compartments, each opening at their lower end into said chamber, in the lower part of the chamber, a discharge aperture at the upper end of each compartment having a significantly smaller cross sectional area than the opening from the chamber into that compartment and means for collecting the gas passing from the compartment through said apertures. By providing these circumferentially spaced discrete compartments and by ensuring that the outlet aperture from these compartments is significantly smaller than the inlet opening, the velocity of the gas discharging through these compartments is significantly reduced solid particles are not entrained. While one set of circumferentially spaced compartments may be provided, it is also contemplated that two or more sets of circumferentially spaced compartments may be included, the openings into the compartments of one set being vertically spaced from the openings into the compartments of the other set or sets. In a preferred construction all of the apertures from the several compartments are connected to a single manifold which will be of annular construction and have its own outlet. While the compartments may be arranged wholly within the chamber, that is at the centre thereof, they are preferably from a space point of view , located in an annular array surrounding the lower part of the chamber.With such a construction, the compartments may be separated from one another by radially extending walls. By suitable design, the gas velocities may be controlled at all sections of the reactor to prevent channelling in the packed bed and entraining from the packed bed. At low flow rates, it is not necessary to have a grate but provision of a grate helps to increase the velocity without entrainment of the solid particles. Thus, in an advantageous construction, a grate is provided at the lower part of the chamber in the region of the openings into the compartment and it is capable of a limited rotary motion.While it could rotate continuously it is preferred to have the limited rotation so that the grate is capable of an oscilating rotary motion having an amplitude no more than the circumferential extent of one of the compartments having an opening adjacent thereto. The radially extending walls may continue downwardly and themselves form scrapers above the grate. In this connection the word grate has been used although for small particle size fuels the grate would be an imperforate plate. To prevent undue circulation of the gas in the lower part of the chamber, radially inwardly extending vanes are preferably provided. A scraper is advantageously mounted below the grate and this can rotate with the grate and or be arranged e0 reciprocate vertically. In order that the invention may more readily be understood, the following description is given, merely by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through one embodiment of reactor according to the invention Figure 2 is a cross section taken along the line 2 2 of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 1 of a second embodiment. The reactor illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a vessel 10 generally of a cylindrical shape with a vertical axis, having upper and lower covers 11 and 12. The covers and the cylindrical wall of the chamber are provided with an insulation 13. Extending axially from the top of the vessel 10 is a fuel inlet 14 which opens downwardly into a chamber 15 having extending upwardly therethrough a central pillar 16 making the chamber 15, in its lower part, generally annular.The inner and outer walls of the chamber are formed of a refractory material and the outer wall extends radially inwardly at 17 to provide a constricted throat portion at 18 having an inclined surface 19 directed downwardly and inwardly. Below the constricted throat the chamber widens again at 20 into a location above a grate 21 which is mounted on a sleeve 22 which is connected to a long tube 25. This long tube 25 is mounted in bearings 26, 27 relative to a support 28. The sleeve 22 can be caused to rotate when the long tube 25 is rotated. Within the long tube 25 is a central shaft 24 and bolts 23 connected to shaft 24 pass through holes 25A in tube 25 and sleeve 22 and also pass through an outer sleeve 29 which carries a scraper 30. The arrangement of the slots 25a enables the grate 21, the long shaft 25 to be rotated about the axis via a drive 32 which is connected to means not shown for causing a limited rotational reciprocatory motion which will be explained later and also allows the scraper to be vertically reciprocated by oscillation of shaft 24. At the bottom of the chamber there is provided an outlet 35 having an outlet duct 36 connected thereto for ash. Surrounding the divergent portion 20 of the chamber are twelve circumferentially spaced compartments 40 defined by twelve radially extending walls 41. These compartments have a lower opening 42 and an upper aperture 43 opening into an annular manifold 44. Thus, all of the compartments 40 coflunicate via their respective aperture 43 with this manifold 44 from which gas may be discharged via a gas outlet 45. In the construction illustrated there are twelve second compartments 50 and twelve third compartments 60, each having a downwardly extending baffle 55, 65 defining with annular walls 46, 56 lower openings 52, 62. The second and third compartments each have outlet apertures 53, 63 communicating with the manifold 44 and thus with the gas outlet 45. The annular walls 46, 56 are preferably inclined to the vertical by an angle of 0 to 600 and the annular baffles 55, 65 are inclined to the vertical by an angle of between 0 and 900. The radial walls 41 are extended downwardly below the openings 44 to provide a scraper 47 and radial vanes 48 extend inwardly into the chamber 20. The baffles 55, 65 may be in the form of perforated plates or screens or baffles with serrated edges, and these may extend across the full lower part of compartments 50, 60 and a further perforated baffle or screen may extend across the inlets 42 of compartments 40. Adjacent the grate 21 is an inspection manhole 72. Air may be introduced into the reactor through an inlet 75 from which it may pass into the long tube 25 and it can be discharged from this via a plurality of circumferentially spaced radially outwardly extending injector tubes 76. In operation, material to be gasified, such as particulate coal, wood or the like, is introduced into the chamber 15 via the inlet 14 and it can be continuously introduced, the level being sensed and controlled by the paddle switch 71. Air is introduced through the tube 25 and is blown into the throat 18 by the nozzles 76, which distributes the air in the annulus. During the downward movement of the solid feedstock drying and pyrolisis take place due to heat transfer from the oxidation zone which is produced to the close to the air inlet 76. In the oxidation zone the reaction with the oxygen results in a very sharp rise in temperature up to 0 about 1700 K. Apart from the regeneration of heat, an important function of this zone is to convert all condensable organic products tar from the pyrolisis zone.In fact the pyrolisis occurs after drying of the feedstock material. Organic gases and liquids are distilled off and consequently the solid residues achieve a high carbon content. To obtain a tar free product gas, the pyrolisis process should be completed in the oxidation zone, that is in the throat section 18. If incompletely pyrolised particles enter the reduction zone, that is the zone 20, tar evolves there and will remain largely unconverted in the product gas. Tar produced in or above the throat section will be cracked and or combusted. The oxidation process is the heat source of the pyrolisis process and the reduction process below the air inlet. Beside the heat generation, the main function of the oxidation is to convert the condensable organic pyrolisis products, for example tar, into non condensables.The latter function is determined mainly by the gas flow patterns, and the temperature profile within the gasifier. The annular throat concept makes it possible to increase the volume and cross section of the throat while the circular flow pattern remains unchanged in size. In this way fine fuels can be gasified, tar free. In the reduction zone, the reduction of CO2 and H20 with char produces the combustible components CO and H2 in the product gas. The product gases can leave the apparatus via the compartments 40, 50, 60, through the lower openings 42, 52, 62 of which are significantly larger in cross sectional dimensions than the outlet apertures 43, 53, 63 which may be of different sizes. This means that there is a very significant slowing down in the flow rate of the discharge gas and the solid particles therein are not entrained and fori an ash. This ensures a dust free product. The arrangement of the grate 21 immediately in the vicinity of the inlet to the compartments ensures no undesirable leakage of the gas. A pile of ash builds up on the grate 21. Since there are twelve equally spaced walls 41, they will be spaced apart by a 300 angle subtended at the axis.The rotation of the grid 21 and the scraper 30 is controlled to be slightly more or less than this circumferential angle, that is slightly less than 300. This prevents any undue buildup on one side of the scraper 47 of ash and a very even distribution is achieved. Ash will fall over the outer edge of the grate 21 into the space therebelow and will eventually fall out through the outlet 35 and outlet duct 36. This is facilitated by the action pf the scraper 30 below the grate 21. This scraper rotates with the grate and can be caused to reciprocate axially by axial reciprocation of the shaft 24. the elongate shape of the openings 25a allows this vertical reciprocation to take place and the bellows construction 78 which is connected at the bottom to a cap 77 prevents ash getting into these openings. While the above described arrangement is included three sets of compartments 40, 50, 60, it is also contemplated that only one such compartment needs be provided. However, better results are achieved if more than one set of circumferentially spaced compartments is provided. Referring now to Figure 3 there is illustrated a modified version of the apparatus of the invention which is being designed particularly for the gasification of coal.Like parts have been indicated by like reference numerals to those in Figure 1. The vessel 10 is of generally cylindrical configuration and thus defines a cylindrical chamber 15 which does not have a constricted portion as inFigure 1. Once again the chamber is provided with upper and lower walls 11, 12 and with insulation 13. In this construction the grate 21 is of a rather different structure comprising a number of tapered lands, the grate being rotatable continuously by the shaft 25. An inlet hopper leads coal via an inlet duct 14 which may include a screw conveyor. The tapered lower portion 12 of the chamber has at its bottom an outlet 35 adjacent to grate 21 through which ash may be discharged either via a duct or into a bin 36. Adjacent the lower end of the cylindrical walls defining the chamber 15 are four radially extending walls 41 and an annular wall 46. These walls define between them four outer chambers 40 and four inner chambers 50, which are circumferentially spaced by the walls 41. The openings to the compartments are indicated as being covered by a screen 80. At their top, the compartments are provided with outlet apertures 43, 53 which discharge into an outlet manifold 44 and this connects via an outlet 45 to a point of use. In this case the screen 80 is a cooling coil connected to a supply 81 of cooling water to prevent it from overheating. The operation of this apparatus is very similar to that of Figures 1 and 2 and detailed discussion of it is not deemed necessary. Once again the particulate material is not entrained by the gas which flows out via the chambers 40, 50 and the apertures 43, 53 into the manifold 44. Indeed larger particles are actually prevented from entering the chambers 40, 50 by the screens 42, 52. Near the top end of the chamber 15 there are provided several circumferentially spaced air inlet nozzles 76 through which air is introduced from a manifold 77.
