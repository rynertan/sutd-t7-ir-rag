# Electrochemical reductions of pyridine carboxamide bases.

## Abstract
Electrochemical reductions of pyridine carboxamide bases performed by electrolysis in a divided flow cell utilizing an ion exchange membrane at a high hydrogen overvoltage cathode and in an aqueous or partly aqueous medium comprising a Lowry Bronsted acid in at least a 1 1 equivalent ratio with the pyridine carboxamide base. A titanium salt catalyst and other means are disclosed to add selectivity to the reduction and improve yield of the amine or other desired reaction product. With all bases, significant advantages of a commercial and industrial nature are reported over prior art static, beaker cell technology.
