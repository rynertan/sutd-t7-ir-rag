# Improvements in or relating to the distribution of particulate material.

## Abstract
An apparatus for distributing particulate material in cludes a feeder 2 having a charging inlet 4 and a discharge outlet duct 12 having converging walls. Coaxially aligned with the discharge outlet duct 12 is a deflector 26 including a first spreader 28 having diverging outer walls, and a second spreader 30 contiguous with the diverging walls of the first spreader 28 and having diverging walls of an angular inclination to the direction of flow of the particulate material greater than that of the first spreader 28 . The charging inlet 4 may have attached thereto an extension 32 and an expansion chamber 38 into which a feed pipe 48 projects, the expansion chamber and the feed pipe being external to a receiving vessel. The particulate material may be fed into feeder 2 entrained in air. The material leaving the second spreader 30 is uni formly distributed and may form a hollow curtain of uniformly distributed particulate material. The curtain may fall into a spray mixing vessel, and a circular baffle 60 may contain the curtain. The baffle 60 may carry fins 62 and divide the curtain into pre determined separate streams. The streams may be led away for use elsewhere, and streams may be formed at the discharge end of the second spreader 30 rather than by the use of fins.
