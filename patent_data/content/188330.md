## Description
The present invention relates to variable length columns with particular emphasis on columns for mounting seats on bases to form variable height seats, for instance office chairs. Many chairs are currently produced which comprise a base, often provided with castors, and a single column supporting the chair seat. Often, some means of adjusting the height of the column is provided. In more sophisticated chairs of this kind, the column is telescopic and is urged to elongate by the pressure of gas contained in a reservoir, latch means controlled by a lever being provided to lock the column in a desired position. The present invention relates to improvements in seat columns of this kind and has particular but not exclusive application to seat columns in which elongation of the column is urged by a spring rather than by compressed gas. In particular, the present invention relates to variable length columns eg. support columns for mounting seats on bases to form variable height seats, comprising German Patent Specification DE A 2406338 describes an adjustment mechanism for a chair seat of this kind. The latch members are a plurality of balls protruded through a ring of holes in an inner tubular member to engage against the smooth internal surface of an outer tubular member. The balls are pressed outward by an annular wedge formation on a central rod connected to an operating lever. Such an arrangement does not reliably provide a sufficiently positive locking of the column to cope with shock loads imposed by a heavy person dropping sharply into the chair. Moreover, such a system will be susceptible to wear because the hardened steel balls used will be likely to wear and deform the inner surface of the outer tube. British Patent Specification GB A 770833 discloses a generally similar type of adjustment mechanism in the context of a variable height table. Unlike DE A 2406338, this specification does not disclose the use of a spring to bias the first and second elongate tubular members to lengthen the column. In this specification a helical spring is welded to the interior of the outer tubular member to provide a seating for the balls of the adjustment mechanism. For use in a chair support column, the adjustment mechanism needs to include a substantial source of power urging the column to lengthen. Typically, this is a powerful coil spring. In order that the column may be of pleasing proportions, the adjustment mechanism must be such as to accommodate such a spring within a pleasingly slender column. This would be difficult or impossible using the arrangement shown in GB A 770833. Furthermore, because of the greater weight to be carried by a chair compared to a table, and to the greater shock loads experienced, the use of a spring welded to the interior of a tube is not likely to provide sufficient strength and wear resistance. Furthermore, such an arrangement involves substantial difficulties in assembly since it is necessary to weld a long spring to the interior of a long tube. The methods suggested in GB A 770833 such as immersion in a pewter bath are not likely to produce a system that will stand up to the great stresses involved in use in a chair column. The present invention provides a variable length column eg. for mounting a seat on a base to form a variable height seat comprising The said tubular member is preferably of circular cross section but may be a flat sided member of any suitable cross section. Preferably, the means acting between the first and second elongate members is a spring, preferably a coil spring and most preferably a coil compression spring. The spring is ideally so chosen as to produce a tendency to extend the column which in use will at least just be counteracted by the full weight of the lightest anticipated user of the seat. Preferably, the recess formations are provided by a series of spaced annular grooves formed around the second elongate member. The second elongate member preferably is a rod but might be a tube. The latch members may be mounted in through bores in the walls of the first elongate member. Preferably the latch members are balls, for instance steel balls, which may be hardened steel balls. The means for displacing the latch member or members to engage the recess formations may comprise a longitudinally shiftable camming member having cam formations to engage the latch member or latch members and to displace them to enter the recess formations upon longitudinal shifting of the camming member from a release position to an engaging position. Alternatively a camming member which operates by rotational rather than longitudinal shifting might be employed. Preferably the camming member is biased to the engaging position and control means are provided for temporarily displacing the camming member to the release position against the bias. The control means may for instance be a control lever operating to shift a control tube extending longitudinally within the column and carrying the camming member. The first or the second elongate member may be connected to a base member by suspension means such as a coil compression spring. This feature may be used to provide spring suspension of a seat mounted to a base by the column independent of the height adjustment. Preferably the first elongate member is received within a first tubular member connected to the first elongate member and the second elongate member is received within a second tubular member connected to the second elongate member, said first and second tubular members being telescopically interfitting and together serving to contain said first and second elongate members. The first or the second tubular member may be connected to the seat by any suitable means such as a morse taper provided on the tubular member and received in a suitable socket in the seat. The other of the first and second tubular members may be mounted to a base. The invention includes a seat comprising a base, a column as described above and a seat mounted on the column. In particular, the invention includes a variable height chair incorporating such a column. The invention will be illustrated by the following description of a preferred embodiment with the reference to the accompanying drawing in which As shown in the Figures, a column 100 according to the invention comprises a pair of telescopically slideable tubular members 101 upper and 102 lower contained within which members is an adjustment mechanism by which the tubular members may be locked at different column extensions. The lower tubular member 102 is of larger diameter and the lower end of the upper tubular member 101 which is of lesser diameter is received within the tubular member 102. Within the base of tubular member 102 there is welded a disc 103 having a central aperture in which is received an axially extending base plug 104. Base plug 104 is restrained against upward movement through the aperture in disc 103 by a circlip not shown engaging in an annular groove 105. Plug 104 is surrounded above the disc 103 by a ball bearing unit 106. A radially enlarged portion of the base plug 104 presents a downwardly facing annular shoulder 107 and trapped between shoulder 107 and the upper face of the ball bearing unit 106 is a coil compression spring 108. An upwardly directed annular shoulder 109 on the base plug 104 is provided by the junction between an uppermost portion 110 thereof and said radially enlarged portion. A central threaded blind bore in the upper face of the base plug 104 receives a reduced diameter screwed nose portion 111 of a grooved locking rod 112 constituting the second elongate member of the 25 column as defined above. Nose portion 111 is a tight fit through the entry to the bore in plug 104 which is restricted by an annular, inwardly directed lip 113. The grooved locking rod 112 has along its length a series of closely spaced semi circular cross section annular grooves 114 occupying most of its length. In an otherwise plain portion at the top of the locking rod there is provided an O ring 112 Extending up from base plug 104 and seated against annular shoulder 109 is a spring compressor tube 115. This extends to a height slightly less than that of the top of the grooved locking rod 112 and terminates in a radially outwardly directed enlargement 115 An annular space is generated between the grooved locking rod 112 and the interior of the spring compressor tube 115 and a second annular space is generated between the interior of the tubular member 102 and the exterior of the spring compressor tube 115. The upper tubular member 101 has at its upper end a morse taper portion 101 At the top of tubular member 101 is seated a nylon bush 116 having a radially extending flange 116 A coil compression spring 119 is received over the portion of the release rod 117 below the enlarged portion 118. Below the spring 119 there is provided within the tubular member 101 a stop member 120 having an external shape corresponding to the internal shape of the tubular member 101 in the region where the morse taper connects to the constant diameter portion 101 At its lower end, the ball carrier tube 121 is a close sliding fit over the grooved locking rod 112 and forms a sliding seal with the O ring 112 Adjacent the bottom of the ball carrier tube 121 there are provided a circle of bores 123 through the wall of the tube in each of which is received a hardened steel ball 124 of a diameter marginally less than the diameter of the respective bore. Within the annular space between the exterior of the ball carrier tube 121 and the interior of the spring compressor tube 115 there is received a release tube 125 which at its upper end abuts the base of the stop member 120 and receives the cross pin 122 thus fixing the release tube to the release rod 117. A lower end portion 125a of release tube 125 acts as a camming member and has on its interior face an annular groove 126 of a sufficient depth to accommodate approximately half the diameter of a ball 124. With the release tube in its normal rest position abutting the stop member 120, the lowermost portion of the release tube 125 presses the balls 124 into an adjacent groove 114 of the grooved locking rod 112. Finally, in the annular volume between the release tube exterior and the interior of the tubular member 101 there is received a powerful coil compression spring 127 acting between the stop member 120 and the upper end of the spring compressor tube 115. This spring 127 acts indirectly between the first elongate member provided by the ball support tube and the seond elongate member provided by the locking rod tending to force these memebrs telescopically apart. Such telescopic movement is prevented by the engagement of the balls 124 in the grooves 114 of the locking rod 112 so long as the balls are held in place by the release tube 125. Depression of the protuding portion of the top of release rod 117 by a suitable lever lowers the release rod 125 against the force of the spring 119 to bring the groove 126 of the release rod behind the balls 124 allowing them to fall out of the groove 114 of the locking rod in which they are at that time received. With the release rod 117 depressed in this way, the first and second elongate members are free to be displaced by the coil spring 127 to elongate the column or to be driven by force applied to the uper tubular member 101, for instance by the weight of a user of a seat mounted thereon, to contract the column against the force of the coil spring 127. Release of the locking rod 117 raises the release tube 115 to push the balls 124 into the nearest groove 114 of the locking rod 112 thus locking the column at any desired extension. Swivelling movement of a seat mounted on the morse taper of the tubular member 101 is accommodated by the beall bearing unit 106. Some degree of cushioning of the column is provided by the hard rubber stop 108. If a more cushioned effect is desired this may be replaced by a powerful suspension spring. Extensive testing has shown that the mechanism is strong, wear resistant, resistant to shock load and can be made pleasingly compact. In an ultimate test to destruction, the unit remained a completely safe, stable entity. The mechanism specifically described above provides a number of significant advantages. Such a mechanism allows a chair height adjustment of 72 mm minimum from a length of 220 mm in the contracted position whilst accommodating the entire mechanisms within an outer diameter of 28 mm. A very powerful coil lift spring can be accommodated around the lock release mechanism within a 24 mm bore tube whilst retaining the ability to lift a chair weighing about 50 pounds. It is preferred that the outer diameter of the column should be less than 45 mm, preferably less than 30 mm and preferably about 28 mm. Significant manufacturing advantages are also presented. The central grooved locking rod may be of less than 10 mm diameter but remain extremely strong even when grooved since all the forces applied are entirely of tension or compression. The locking forces directed through the balls are in toward the rod axis, against which forces a rod is extremely strong. This contrasts with the arrangement shown in DE A 2406338 where the force directed by the balls is outwards so that the tube in question is subjected to stretching loads which may only be partially contained by the hoop strength of the thin wall of the tube leading the tube being dented outwardly. External grooves on a rod are extremely simple to machine to an accurate spacing and depth whatever the length of the rod which means that the ball engagement depth remains constant leading to a good cooperation with the release tube. If an attempt is made to machine similar formations on the interior of a tube in a variation of what is shown in DE A 2406338, the manufacturing process is much more difficult and large tolerances are needed to allow for tool push off, leading to poor performance. For maximum wear resistance, given the small contact area between the locking rod and the balls, it is necessary that the groove faces be hardened. This is extremely easy with the utilisation of a locking rod. There is a good choice of materials available and it is easy to obtain consistent results. It would be difficult or impossible to obtain similar constant results in hardening the interior of commercially available tubes. The invention has been described with reference to the characteristics of the illustrated embodiment but it should be understood that many modifications and variations thereof are possible withn the scope of the invention. The illustrated column provides a smooth and reliable height adjustment with a positive locking mechanism whilst avoiding the cost and complexity of a gas compression system and the risk of failure of pressure seals or explosion. Although the invention has been presented as relating to columns for seats, it is to be understood that variable length columns of the kind described can be employed in a wide variety of other situations, subject where appropriate to being produced in small or larger sizes and with appropriate spring rates. Examples of such other uses include adjustable height tables, in vehicles as bonnet, boot, hatch or tail gate lifts, in chair tilt mechanisms or any system where a column requiring accurate infrequent securely locked adjustment is wanted.
