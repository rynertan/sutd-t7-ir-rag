# Rotocasting process for producing rubbery reinforced sport balls and play balls.

## Abstract
A process is provided for making reinforced rubbery sport and play balls by rotational casting, in a mold lined with a nonwoven fabric, a liquid polymer composition containing an epoxy resin, a liquid carboxyl terminated polymer, an amine, a dihydric compound, and a plasticizer. The sections of nonwoven fabric in the mold are preshrunk and sealed together by means of an amine terminated liquid polymer. The resultant sport and play balls have good dimensional stability and the desired flex and tear properties.
