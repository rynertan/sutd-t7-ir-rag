# AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF DEVICE

## Abstract
An automatic shutoff device is of the type which makes use of a venturi to terminate the flow of a liquid into a container when the liquid in the container reaches the level of a discharge tube. A movable housing 18 is operatively positioned down stream of a constrictive nozzle 16 giving rise to the venturi and a consequent low pressure area the movable housing 18 substantially encompasses the low pressure area except that the downstream end of the housing 18 is open and serves as a discharge tube from which liquid flows into the container to be filled. The filling operation will continue until such time as the level of the liquid reaches the level of the discharge tube at which time liquid is rapidly drawn into the low pressure area causing the housing 18 to move in the downstream direction thereby overcoming the restoring force of an associated spring biased valve 20 causing the valve to seat to thereby substan tially terminate the flow of liquid.
