# High strength material produced by consolidation of rapidly solidified aluminum alloy particulates.

## Abstract
A superior high temperature strength aluminium alloy material is produced by consolidating rapidly solidified particulates of an aluminum alloy into a desired configura tion, the aluminium alloy consisting of, in weight percen tages, 4 to 15 Fe, and 0.5 to 8 V and the balance being essentially aluminum. The aluminum alloy may further contain at least one element selected from the group consisting of 0.5 to 8 Mo, 0.5 to 8 Ni, 0.3 to 8 Zr and 0.05 to 8 Ti. These materials are very useful as economical heat resistant materials for various applications, particularly when high strength at high temperatures and low weight are required.
