# Apparatus for testing hydraulic and pneumatic systems.

## Abstract
An apparatus for and a method of testing a plurality of hydraulic and or pneumatic systems is disclosed in which each such system has a hose 11 connected in it and the hose 11 terminates in a valved fitting 12 . All of the fittings 12 are releasably attached to a subassembly 13 which in turn is attached to a manifold 17 . When the systems are to be tested, a test fixture 26 is attached to the manifold 17 , such attachment automatically opening the valved fittings. The test fixture also includes valved fittings 34 identical with those connected in the systems. All of the fittings are opened by attachment of the test fixture 26 , and the appropriate tests are then carried out. When the systems are not being tested, the test fixture 26 is removed and a protective cover 22 is applied to the manifold in place of the fixture.
