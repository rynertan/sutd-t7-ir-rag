# Hand operated rotary cutter.

## Abstract
A handy rotary cutter comprises a generally elongated plate like handle 10 having a bearing aperture defined at one end thereof, a shaft member 18b supported by the handle 10 and extending through the bearing aperture, a disc blade 13 rotatably mounted on the shaft 18b and lying in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the shaft member 18b and in parallel to any one of the opposed surfaces 10A, 10b , of the handle 10 , and means 19 for adjustably apply ing a frictional force to the disc blade 13 in a direction gener ally perpendicular to the disc blade 13 . The disc blade 13 is, when the rotary cutter is in use, rotated in contact with the material to be cut in a controlled manner.
