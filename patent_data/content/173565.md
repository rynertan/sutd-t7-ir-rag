# Seeding implement with improved opener.

## Abstract
A seeding implement has an opener 30 detachably mounted on a bracket 34 at the bottom of a standard 32 also forming a seed tube opening in a seed boot immediately to the rear of the opener. The opener 30 is of the blade type which slices a groove in the ground and, in order to prevent clogging by trash hairpinned round the opener, it has an arcuate bottom edge 38 curving up from the rear to a forward point 40 , above which a leading edge 42 slopes gently backwards. In operation the point 40 is a little below ground surface. The opener has generally flat sides which diverge to provide a V shaped transverse cross section.
