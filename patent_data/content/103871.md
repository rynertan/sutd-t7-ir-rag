## Description
CARBOXYLIC ACID FUNCTIONAL ORGANOPOLYSILOXANE EMULSIONS The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing novel diorganopolysi loxane emulsions. More speclfically, it concerns a method of manufacturing emulsions of diorganopolysi loxane having carboxylic acid functional groups within the molecule by emulsion polymerization. Diorganopolysi loxanes having carboxylic acid functional groups within the molecule have been proposed as mold releasing agents see Japanese Patent No. Sho 54 1979j 239 and United States Patent 4,076,695 issuedFebruary 28, 1978 , as automotive lubricants see UnitedStates Patent 3,960,574 issued June 1, 1976 , as treatment agents for textiles see Japanese Kokai Patent No. 55 1980 152864 and as paint additives see Japanese Patent No. Sho SZI 1979 33405 . Emulsions of diorganopolysiloxanes having such carboxylic.acid functional groups within the molecule can be manufactured by emulsifying them in water with a suitable emulsifier by standard mechanical techn√≠ques. Examples of suitable emulsifiers include sulfate esters of higher alcohols, alkylbenzenesulfon2tes, and higher alcohol polyoxyalkylene addition products or alkyl phenol polyoxyalkylene addition products see Japanese Kokai Patent No. Sho 5511980 152864 . The emulsions manufactured by such methods, however, generally lack storage stability, dilution stability and shear strength stability It is also difficult to obtain homogeneous emulsions when the diroganopolysiloxanes have a high degree of polymerization. Enulsion polymerization has been employed to produce diorganopolysi loxane emulsions wlth good storage stability. One method of emulsion polymerization of organopolysiloxane employs either a strong mineral acid or strong alkali catalyst as described in either JapanesePatent No. Sho. 34 19591 2041 or United States Patent 2,891,920 issued June 23, 1959 . Another method employs a surface active sulfonic acid for the emulsion polymerization of organopolysiloxanes as taught inJapanese Patent No. Sho 4ll1966 13995 and U.S. Patent 3,294,725 issued December 27, 1966 . Still another method of emulsion polymerization is detailed in JapanesePatent No.Sho 46 1971 41038 which involves emulsification of the organopolysi loxane in water with polyoxyethylene sulfate ester followed by polymerization.U.S. Patent 3,360,491 issued December 26, 1967 used an alkyl hydrogen sulfate as the catalyst and surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of organopolysi loxanes. None of these patents either teaches or even alludes to. the preparation of carboxylic acid functional diorganopolysiloxane emulsions by the technique of emulsion polymerization. An object of the present invention Is to provide a method of producing emulsions of diorganopolysiloxanes containing carboxylic acid functional groups where the emulsions have good storage stability, dilution stability, and shear strength stability. Other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of this specification. The Invention This invention relates. to a method of manufacturing an emulsion of a first diorganopolysiloxane, said method comprising the emulsion co polymerization of A a liquid cyclic or linear second diorganop lysiloxane with a degree of polymerization of at least three where the organo radicals of said second diorganopolysiloxane are selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals, alkenyl radicals, aryl radicals cycloalkyl radicals, cycloalkenyl radicals, aralkyl radicals, alkylaryl radicals, haloalkyl radicals, and mercaptoalkyl radicals and the endblocking groups on said linear. second diorganopolysiloxane are selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, acyloxy groups, and univalent hydrocarbon groups and B a liquid diorganodialkoxysilane or liquid cyclic or linear third diorganopolysiloxane with a degree of polymerization of at.. least three, where said diorganodialkoxysilane or said third diorganopolysi loxane. contains at least one unit of formulaEMI3.1 where R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical, R1 is a diva lent hydrocarbon radical, and R2 Is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a univalent hydrocarbon radical, and a univalent cation in the presence of C a sulfonic acid surfactant and D water. The first diorganopolysiloxane prepared by the method of this invention will have a higher degree of polymerization than either component A or component B and a lower content of units of formula EMI4.1 than component B . In other words, the emulsion prepared by the method of this invention will contain a first diorganopolysiloxane prepared by the emulsion co polymerization of components A and B in the presence of component D and C and the first diorganopolysiloxane is a co polymer of components A and B . Component A may be a cyclic diorganopolysiloxane. Although not wishing to limit our invention by theory, we believe that in the practice of our invention the cyclic diorganopolysi loxane of component A is emulsified along with component B in water component D by the sulfonic acid surfactant component C , after which component A undergoes a ring opening reaction through the catalytic acid of component C and is finally polymerized with component B or its hydrolyzate. The cyclic diorganopolysiloxane should have a degree of polymerization of at least three and should be liquid at normal temperatures. By normal temperatures we mean the temperatures at which the emulsion polymerization can be carried out, It is preferred that the degree of polymerization be in the range of. 3 to 6. The cyclic diorganopolysiloxane can be described by the general formula R2SiO x where x is the degree of polymerization and R is a monovalent hydrocarbon or substituted hydrocarbon radical. For example, R may, independently, be alkyl radicals such as methyl radicals, ethyl radicals and propyl radicals alkenyl radicals such as vinyl radicals aryl radicals such as phenyl radicals, xenyl radicals and naphthyl radicals cycloalkyl radicals such as cyclohexyl radicals cycloalkenyl radicals such as cyclohexenyl radicals aralkyl radicals such as benzyl radicals alkylaryl radicals such as tolyl radicals and xylyl radicals haloalkyl radicals such as 3 chloropropyl groups, 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl radicals or mercaptoalkyl radicals such as 3 mercaptopropyl radicals.It is preferred that the cyclic diorganopolysiloxane contain methyl radicals and it is most preferred that the cyclic diorganopolysiloxane contain only methyl radicals. Component A may also be a linear diorganopolysiloxane. It is believed that the linear diorganopolysiloxane A is emulsified along with component B in component D by component C and then polymerized with component B or its hydrolysate through the catalytic action of component C . There are no particular limitations on the linear diorganopolysi loxane A as long as the degree of polymerization is at least three and it is liquid at normal temperatures. It is preferred that the degree of polymerization of the linear diorganopolysiloxane A be in the range of 3 to 100.The organic groups attached to silicon are the same as those R radicals described for the cyclic diorganopolysiloxane. The ends of the molecular chains are not especially limited. Examples of possible endblocking groups include hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, acyloxy groups and univalent hydrocarbon groups such as methyl groups, ethyl groups, phenyl groups and vinyl groups. Component B may be either a diorganodia koxysilane or a cyclic or linear diorganopolysiloxane which contains at least one unit of formula EMI6.1 where R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical, R1 is a divalent hydrocarbon radical, and R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a univalent hydrocarbon radical, and a univalent cation. An example of a diorganodialkoxysilane B is given by the formulaEMI6.2 where R, R1, and R2 are defined above and R3 is an alkyl group. R has the same examples as listed earlier in the discussion of component A . Examples of the divalent hydrocarbon radical R1 include the ethylene radical, n propylene radical, isopropy lene radical, and phenylene radical. Examples of R2, when a univalent hydrocarbon radical, are the same as given for R.Preferable R2, when a univalent hydrocarbon radical, contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of R2, when a univalent cation, A 1 2 include Na , K , and NH4 . Therefore the R COOR group includes the free carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid esters, and carboxylic acid salts. Examples of R3 include, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, hexyl, . and vinyl radicals. The diorganopolysi loxane of component B having at least one unit of formulaEMI6.3 may be either cyclic or linear. R, R1, and RZ have the same definitions as given earlier. When the diorganopolysiloxane B is cyclic there are no particular limitations except that the degree of polymerization should be at least three and that the siloxane should be liquid at normal temperatures. A degree of polymerization of 3 to 6 is preferred. When the diorganopolysiloxane B is linear there are no particular limitations as long as the degree of polymerization is at least 3 and it is liquid at normal temperatures. A degree of polymerization between 3 and t00 for the linear diorganopolysiloxane B is preferable for ease of preparing the emulsion.Whether cyclic or linear, this diorganopolysiloxane may be constructed only of units expressed by the formulaEMI7.1 or of both this unit and other diorganosiloxane units.Examples of other diorganosiloxane units include dimethylsiloxane units, methylphenylsiloxane units, methylvinylsiloxane units and methyl 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl siloxane units. Examples of the end groups of this linear diorganopolysiloxane are the same as the end groups of the linear diorganopolysi loxane of component A . Component C is both an emulsifier and polymerization catalyst for components A and B .Examples of component C are sulfonic acids expressed by the general formula R4C6H4SO3H and the general formula R5O C2H4O mSO3H where, R4 is an aliphatic univalent 5 hydrocarbon group with at least 6 carbon atoms, RS is an aliphatic univalent hydrocarbon group with at least 6 carbon atoms or univalent hydrocarbon substituted aryl group, and m is a number with an average value of 1 to 15.Specific examples of suitable surfactants include octylbenzenesul fonic acid, decylbenzenesul fonic acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, cetylbenzenesulfonic acid, myristylbenzenesulfonic acid, CH3 CH2 8CH20 C2H4O 2503H, CH3 CH2 8CH2O C2HO 8SO3H, CH3 CH2 10CH2O C2H4O 4SO3H, and CH3 CH2 8CH2 C6H40 C2H40 2S03H . Another example is a naphthylsulfonic acid bonded to long chained alkyl groups. Component D , water, is the emulsification medium for components A and 8 . In the emulsion co polymerization of component A and component B in the presence of component C and component D , a homogenous emulsion may be prepared by passing the mixture consisting of a solution of component C dissolved in component D and a mixture of component A and component B through an emulsion apparatus such as a homogenizer, colloid mill or line mixer. After maintaining this emulsion for 1 20 hours at 40 900C while stirring gently, it is cooled to room temperature. Next, it is made neutral or weakly alkaline by neutralizing with a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or, triethanolamine. The carboxyl groups in the generated diorganopolysiloxane may become carboxylates when the emulsified compound is made weakly alkaline. The proportions of each of the components during the emulsipn co polymerization should be a combined total of 20 80 parts by weight of components A and B and 1 5 parts by weight of component C per 100 parts by weight of component D . The relative proportion of components A and B is based on the desired content of siloxane units containing the carboxyl functional group in the resulting emulsion. During emulsion polymerization, corrosion inhibitors, surfactants other than component C such as, for example, nonionic surfactants to stabilize the emulsion and protective colloids such as, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, and carboxymethylcellulose, dyes, and chain end blocking agents such aSs, for example, hexaorganodisiloxane, may be added as needed in addition to components A D . The product obtained from such emulsion polymerization is a homogenous emulsion of diorganopolysiloxane with a higher degree of polymerization than components A and B and with a lower content of the unit expressed by the formulaEMI9.1 than component B . It has excellent storage stability, dilution stability and shear strength stability. This emulsion can be used as is or diluted with water as a mold releasing agent, stripping agent, textile treatment agent, hair rinse, lubricant, paint addition, defoaming agent, etc.It may also be used as an interfiber adhesive bonding agent for textiles, knits or unwoven cloth made of natural fibers, semi synthetic fibers, synthetic fibers, natural inorganic fibers such as asbestos and rock wool , synthetic inorganic fibers such as glass fibers, silicon carbide fibers, stainless steel fibers, and carbon fibers and their composite materials. When used as an interfiber adhesive, the textile materials may be immersed in the neat or diluted emulsion of the present invention after which the textile materials can be wrung out sufficiently and dried at room temperature or under heat. The emulsion of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other silicone emulsions containing, for example, silane coupling agents or dimethylpolysiloxane as well as emulsions of reactive organopolysiloxanes such as the amino functional siloxanes. In order that thosesskilled in art may better understand how the present invention can be practiced. the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Parts in the examples means parts by weight . The viscosity and refraction index values were determined at 250C.Example 1 A cyclic dimethylsiloxane tetramer 28.5 parts and 1.5 parts of a cyclic diorganopolysiloxane containing the carboxyl group as shown by the formulaEMI10.1 were added to 2 parts of dodecyibenzene sulfonic acid dissolved in 60 parts water with stirring. The mixture was converted into an emulsion by passing it 3 times through a homogenizer emulsifying machine at 400 kg cm2 at 600C. This emulsion was kept at 850C for 2 hours while stirring gently and then kept at 200C for 4 hours.The emulsion was then neutralized with dimethylformamide.The emulsion was left at room temperature for 3 months in order to study its stability upon standing. Absolutely no changes In the emulsion were observed. To study the dilution stability of this emulsion, the emulsion was diluted 20 times with water and left to stand for one week at room temperature. The diluted emulsion remained homogenous and did not cream. To study the shear strength stability of this emulsion, the emulsion was placed in a blender and treated for 30 minutes at a speed of 3000 rpm. The emulsion did not collapse. Upon the addition of methyl alcohol the emulsion collapsed. The polymer recovered was a sticky liquid with a viscosity of about 700,000 cs and a refraction index of 1.4056. It was confirmed by the infrared absorption spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and gel permeation chromatography that the polymer was straight chained diorganopolysiloxane consisting of about 90 mol ofEMI11.1 units and about 2 mol ofEMI11.2 units with hydroxyl endblocking.Example 2 Dimethylpolysiloxane 28.5 parts with both ends of the chain closed by hydroxyl groups and a viscosity of 80 cs, 3.5 parts of cyclic diorqanopolysiloxane shown by the formulaEMI11.3 and 0.17 parts of hexamethyidisiloxane as a chain end blocking agent were added to 2 parts dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid dissolved in 60 parts water. The mixture was emulsified by passing it through a homogenizer emulsifying machine 3 times at 400 kg cm2. After maintaining this emulsion at 850C for 10 hours with stirring gently, it was kept at 200C for an additional 2 hours and then neutralized with dimethylformamide. The emulsion was kept at room temperature for 3 months to study its stability upon standing. No visible changes were observed after storage.To study the dilution stability of this emulsion, the emulsion was diluted 20 times with water and left to stand at room temperature for one week. It remained homogenous and no oil floated to the surface. To study the shear strength stability of this emulsion, the emulsion was placed in a blender and treated for 30 minutes at a speed of 3000 rpm. The emulsion did not collapse. This emulsion collapsed when methyl alcohol was added. The polymer recovered was a colorless, transparent liquid with a viscosity of 3100 cs and a refraction index of 1.4082. It was confirmed by the infrared absorption spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and gel permeation chromatography to be a diorganopolysiloxane with the average composition shown in the following formulaEMI12.1 Example 3 A mixture 29 parts of cyclic dimethylsiioxane tetramer and pentamer and 1.0 parts of diorganodimethoxysilane shown by the formulaEMI12.2 was added to 2 parts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid in 60 parts of water with stirring. An emulsion was prepared by twice passing the mixture through a homogenizer emulsifying machine at 450 kg cm2. The emulsion was then maintained at 900C for 16 hours while stirring gently.After an additional 24 hours at 5 C the emulsion was neutralized with triethanolamine. When the stability upon standing, dilution stability and shear strength stability of the emulsion were evaluated in the same way as in Example 1, the same excellent results were obtained. This emulsion collapsed when methyl alcohol was added. The polymer recovered had a viscosity of about 890,000 cs and a refraction indexsof 1.4055. It was confirmed by the infrared absorption analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and gel permeation chromatography that both ends of the polymer chain were closed by hydroxyl groups and that the main chain is represented by the average formulaEMI13.1 Example 4 Cyclic dimethylsiloxane tetramer 35 parts , 2.0 parts of cyclic diorganopolysiloxane containing the mercaDto arouD shown bv the formulaEMI13.2 2.2 parts of cyclic diorganopolysiloxane containing the carboxy group shown by the formula EMI14.1 and 0.8 parts of hexamethyldisiloxane as a chain end blocking agent were added to 2 parts dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid in 60 parts water with stirring. An emulsion was prepared by passing the mixture three times through a homogenizer emulsifying machine at 450 kg cm2. After maintaining the emulsion for 8 hours at 850C with stirring gently followed by an additional 2 hours at ZOOC, the emulsion was neutralized with dimethylformamide.The stability upon standing, dilution stability and shear strength stability of the emulsion obtained in this way were studied in the same way as in Example 1 and the same excellent results were obtained. This emulsion collapsed when methyl alcohol was added. The polymer recovered was a colorless, transparent liquid with a viscosity of about 500 cs and a refraction index of 1.4088. It was confirmed by the infrared absorption spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, and gel permeation chromatography to be diorganopolysiloxane with a mean composition represented by the following formula. EMI15.1 Example S A cyclic dimethylsiloxane tetrame r 30 parts , 8 parts of cyclic methylvinylsiloxane and 2 parts of a diorganodiethoxysilane expressed by the formulaEMI15.2 were added to 1.5 parts of a surfactant formula C17H35 C2H4O 2SO3H dissolved in 60 parts water with stirring. This was made into an emulsion by passing it one time between 2011000 inch rollers using a colloid mill and twice through a homogenizer emulsifying machine at a pressure of 450 kglcm2, The emulsion was maintained at 900C for 3 hours while stirring gently. After further maintaining the emulsion at 20 C for 10 hours, it was made weakly alkaline by aqueous sodium hydroxide solution.The stability upon standing, dilution stability and shear strength stability of the emulsion obtained in this ways were tested in the same way as inExample 1 and the same excellent results were obtained. This emulsion collapsed with the addition of ethyl alcohol. The polymer recovered was a sticky liquid with a viscosity of about 200,000 cs. It was confirmed from the infrared absorption spectrum, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and gel permeation chromatography to be a straight chain diorganopolysiloxane made of about 86.0 molZ ofEMI16.1 units, about 12.3 molZ ofEMI16.2 units and about 1.7 mol EMI16.3 Comparative Example Mechanical emulsions were prepared from the recovered polymers of Examples.1 and 4. The recovered polymer l15 parts was added with stirring to 2 parts sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate in 30 parts water. An attempt was made to form an emulsion by passing the mixture through a homogenizer emulsifying machine threw 2 times at 400 kg cm2 and a temperature of 60 C. Using the recovered polymer of Example 1 it was not possible to prepare an emulsion in this manner. A homogenous emulsion was prepared using the polymer recovered inExample 4. The mechanical emulsion prepared from the polymer recovered in Example 4 lacked storage stability as it separated into two layers upon storage at room temperature for one month. This mechanical emulsion also lacked dilution stability as it separated into two layers upon being diluted 20 fold with water. This mechanical emulsion also lacked shear strength stability as the emulsion collapsed upon being treated in a blender at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes.
