# Device for holding containers.

## Abstract
The invention provides a holding device for one or more rows of bottles or the like. The device comprises essentially a sleeve of sheet material having upper 24 and lower 20 walls and side walls 22,26 , and the device is applied to the containers by passing it over the containers so that the tops pass through apertures 28 in the base wall and then apertures 32 in the top wall. The containers are locked to the device by virtue of the device having locking tabs or a locking wall 18 which folds upwardly by virtue of engage ment with the containers, but locks under the container rims or beads on the caps of the containers or at the container mouths, preventing removal of the container by movement in an opposite direction. Preferably, there are two locking devices which engage the container rims or beads at opposite sides, and lie in an inclined position relative to the container axis. The sleeve is preferably of rectangular or square cross section so that it can be displaced to flattened form about crease lines lying at a pair of opposite corners, for transportation.
