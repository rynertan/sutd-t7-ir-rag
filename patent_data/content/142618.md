# WATER THINNABLE POLYAMIDES

## Abstract
The disclosure is of a copolymer reaction product of A 20 to 60 equivalent percent of a polymeric fatty acid B 0 to 60 equivalent percent of a polycarboxylic acid C 15 to 50 equivalent percent of a monocarboxylic acid and D 5 to 25 equivalent percent of a synthetic polymeric resin having a crystalline chain structure, said resin having active carboxyl and or hydroxyl groups capable of reaction with acid amine groups with E 50 to 80 equivalent percent of an organic polyamine. The copolymer is useful in flexographic ink compositions and such are advantageously water reducible thinnable .
