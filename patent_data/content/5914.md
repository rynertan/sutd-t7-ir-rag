## Description
Chemical Process For the Preparation of 3 Lactamase Inhibitors British Patent Application 03892 76 19002 76 see also Belgian Patent No. 850779 discloses thioether derivatives of clavulanic acid, pharmaceutical com ppsitions containing them and a process for their preparation. The disclosed process comprised the reaction of an ester of clavulanic acid with a thiol and thereafter if desired converting the thus formed ester of the thioether into the corresponding free acid or its salt. Although the process disclosed is very versatile leading to the preparation of a wide class of thioethers it suffers from the disadvantage of giving only relatively poor yields.The later French Published Patent ApplicationNo. 2,342,292 also discloses the preparation of thioethers of clavulanic acid by the reaction of a sulphur nucleo phile with an ester of f 9 halo or 9 acyloxydeoxyclavulanic acid. It is desirable to find a synthesis that has acceptable yields and is convenient to operate. A synthesis has now been found that has the advantage that it may be carried out at ambient temperature if desired, does not involve the use of foul smelling thiols at the coupling stage but instead employs easily weighable, solid sulfenimide intermediates. The intermediates used in this process are also conveniently accessible and used, for example by the methods of M.Behforouz andJ.E. Kenwood, J. Org. Chem., 34, 51 1969 or K.A.M.Walker, Tet. Lett., 4475 1977 . The use of this process for preparing aryl thioethers offers the further advantage of particularly good yields. The present invention provides a process for the preparation of thioether derivatives of deoxyclavulanic acid of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is the residue of a thiolR1SH and R2 is a group such that CO R2 represents a carboxylic acid moiety or a salt or ester thereof which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula II EMI2.2 with a compound of the formula III EMI2.3 and a compound of the formula IV EMI3.1 in which compounds R1 is as defined in relation to formula I R3 and R4 are moieties such that the compound of the formula II is a sulfenimide R5 is a group such that the compound of the formula III is an ester of clavulanic acid and R6, R7 and R8 are groups such that the compound of the formula IV is a phosphine and thereafter if desired converting the thus formed compound of the formula I wherein R2 is a group 2 such that C02R2 represents an esterified carboxylic acid 2 moLety to a corresponding compound wherein R is a moiety such that C02R2 represents a carboxylic acid moiety or a salt thereof. Suitable groups R1 include hydrocarbon groups and hydrocarbon groups substituted by a group of the sub formulae OR9, O.CO.R9, CO.R9. C02R9, CO R9 NH.CO.R9, NR10.COR9 2 and NR10C02R9 wherein R9 is a lower alkyl group or lower 2 aralkyl group and R10 is a lower alkyl group. When used herein the term thydrocarbon includes alkyl, alkenyl, phenyl and phenylalkyl groups. When used herein the term lower means that the group contains up to 4 carbon atoms. When used herein the term aralkyl means a lower alkyl group substituted by a phenyl group. Certain favourable groups R1 include the methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, phenyl, benzyl, allyl, 2 methoxyethyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, 4 methoxybenzyl and the like. Preferred groups R1 include optionally substituted phenyl groups. Further preferred groups Rl are optionally substituted aromatic heterocyclic groups, such as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and the like. Thus it will be realised that in a particularly preferred aspect of this invention, R1 is an optionally substituted aromatic group. 2 Suitable groups CO2R include those of the subformulae C02A or CO2CHA2A3 wherein A1 is a lower alkyl group optionally substituted by a group OA4, O.CO.A4 orO.CO.O.A4 wherein A4 is a lower alkyl or phenyl group A2 is a lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, phenyl group or phenyl group substituted by a halogen atom or nitro, A5, OA5 or o.Co.A5 group where A5 is a lower alkyl group and A3 is a hydrogen atom or a phenyl group or a phenyl group substituted by a halogen atom or a nitro, A5, OA5 or O.CO.A5 group where A5 is a lower alkyl group or CHA A represents a phthalidyl group. Suitably the C02R2 group is one readily cleaved by mild base, for example a lower alkyl or lower alkoxymethyl group. Suitably the C02R2 group is one readily cleaved by hydrogenolysis, for example a benzyl group optionally substituted by a halogen atom or a nitro, A5, OA5 or O.CO.A5 group where A5is a lower alkyl group. The benzyl, p methoxybenzyl and p nitrobenzyl group are particularly favoured. The groups R3 and R4 will normally be selected from hydrocarbon groups which may be linked together.Particularly apt groups R and R4 include lower alkyl groups optionally linked to form part of a 5 or 6membered ring. Preferred compounds of the formula II include those of the formulae V and VI EMI5.1 wherein R1 is as defined in relation to formula I . The compounds of the formula V are particularly suitable as a by product of the reaction is water soluble and may thus be readily removed by washing with water. Suitable values for R6, R7 and R include hydrocarbon groups of up to 7 carbon atoms and hydrocarbon groups substituted by a group of the sub formulae OR 11 or O.CO.R11 where R is a lower alkyl group. Most suitably R6, R7 and R8 each have the same meaning. Favoured values for R6, R7 and R8 include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, phenyl, 4 methoxyphenyl and benzyl. A particularly suitable compound of the formula IV is tri n butyl phosphine. The reaction of the compounds of the formulae II , III and IV , may take place at any convenient nonextreme temperature, for example 100C to 500C, more usually Oo to 400C, generally 100 to 30 C and very conveniently at ambient about 15 25 C . The reaction is generally carried out in an aprotic medium. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene and the like. If desired the reaction may be carried out under an inert gas such as nitrogen. Once the reaction is complete, for example as indicated by tlc, the mixture may be washed with water to remove the water soluble products, and the organic layer dried and evaporated. The initial product may be further purified by chromatography if desired, for example over silica eluting with ethyl acetate petroleum ether or the like. Once formed the ester of the thioether may be converted to the corresponding acid or salt in conventional manner, for example as described in BelgianPatent No. 847045.
