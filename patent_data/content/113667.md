# Method and apparatus for prognosticating potential ice accumulation on a surface exposed to impact icing.

## Abstract
An article and method for measuring the extent, location and rate of water vapor droplet impingements on various surfaces exposed to multi dimensional and turbulent flow fields. The article and method are employed in a non icing atmospheric environment, and the results are used to prognosticate not only the areas where ice would accumu late if the water droplets were supercooled but also the concentration thereof. The invention is accomplished by removably adhering a droplet impingement recorder 10 to a surface to be tested, such as an airfoil 20 . The droplet impingement recorder 10 incorporates a water soluble gelatin coating 13 bonded to a substrate 11 . Droplets suspended in the flow field impact upon the recording surface 18 of the droplet impingement recorder 10 . The recording surface 18 is then microscopically analyzed to determine the size, location and concentration of droplet impingements which information assists one in prognosti cating the most effective location for the installation of anti icing or de icing equipment.
