# PHOSPHORUS AND HIGH PHOSPHORUS POLYPHOSPHIDE BARRIERS IN QUANTUM WELL DEVICES

## Abstract
A semiconductor device characterised in that it com prises A a layer of semiconductor material comprising an interme tallic semiconductor and B a first barrier layer adjacent one side of the said semicon ductor layer, which barrier layer comprises phosphorus is disclosed. Referring to the accompanying diagram, a semiconductor device 20 may comprise an intermetallic semiconductor layer 22 and barrier layers 23 and 24, the interface 26 causes a quantum well to develop. A method of making a quantum well device character ised in that it comprises depositing a barrier layer comprising phosphorus on an intermetallic semiconductor comprising a pnictide is also disclosed. Phosphorus and polyphosphides MP The present invention provides advantages over the prior art.
