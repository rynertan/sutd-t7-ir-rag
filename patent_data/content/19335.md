## Description
Tools for the machining of material. The invention relates to tools for the machining of material, particularly for the machining of metals, comprising a ceramic cutting insert. The handbook Ceramics in Machining Processes by A.G.King and W.M.Wheildon Academic Press 1966, New York and London , pages XIII XXI and 1 28, describes dense polycrystalline aluminium oxide having the corundum crystal structure, as a ceramic material for machining tools. The material contains additions which are used to refine the grain structure and or as sintering agents, such as MgO, TiO and NiO. The advantages of this material as compared with material of high speed steel inserts for machining tools reside in a greater hardness, a higher compressive strength and a higher operating temperature.A drawback, however, is the lower transverse breaking strength and the fact that the tool life is not as long as the high speed steel. The invention has for its object to provide a ceramic insert material for a machining tool, which ceramic material has a longer tool life, whilst retaining the above mentioned advantages. From an article by Nils Claussen et al, entitled Effect of induced microcracking on the fracture toughness of ceramics in Ceramics Bulletin 56, 559 562 1977 , a ceramic material is known which has a great hardness and notch impact strength, this material consisting of sintered Awl 0 in which an unstabilized ZrO2 is dispersed. The 23 latter material exists in two crystal modifications, namely a monoclinic modification having a low density 5.56 g cm3 up to approximately 10000C, and a tetragonal modification having a high density 6.10 g above that temperature.When material, which is isostatic hot pressed above 1000 C, is cooled there is a tendency for the high density tetra onal phase to be converted into the low density monoclinic pbse. As this is only partly possible, internal colipressve stresses are produced which considerably increate the breaking strength of the material. According to the invention it appeared that the properties required for the use of a ceramic material in a machining tool can be obtained in a simple manner, that is to say by sintering at atmospheric pressure in the presence of a grain growth inhibitor. Sintering may be performed at temperatures between 1450 and 16500C when iO and or CoO is added to the starting material in a quantity of between approximately 0.02 and 0.2 by weight ctndXor one or more of the oxides Cr203, La203 and Y203 in a quantity of between 0.05 and 1 by weight as grain growth inhibitors, the total quantity thereof not exceeding 1 by we eight. A grain growth inhibitor is essential to obtain the required properties. According to the invention, a ceramic insert for a machining tool consisting of an aluminium oxide based ceramic material is characterized in that the ceramic material contains between 10 and 25ib by weight of finely dispersed zirconium oxide and not more than 1 by weight of one or more grain growth inhibitors, the balance beingAl2O3 and that the ceramic material has a porosity of less than 1 by volume. The grain growth inhibiting additive consists preferably of nickel oxide and or cobalt oxide in a total quantity of between 0. 09 and 0. 254 by weight and or one or more of the oxides of chromium III , lanthanum and yttrium in a total quantity of between 0 05 and lCjo by weight.The grain growth inhibitors should be present in at least an amount which is sufficient to function as such in the mixture. The minimum amount can be found experimentally The ceramic insert material is preferably pro duced from a mixture of dry milled aluminium oxide having an average crystallite size of approximately 0.3 um and zirconium oxide having a particle size of which at least 70 by weight is between 1 and 3 um, and at least one of exides of nickel, cobalt,chromium, lanthanum and t,rium, this mixture being sintered at a temperature between 1450 and 1650 C, after having been shaped and compacted to a density of more than 2.2 g cm3. By way of example there now follows the descripion of the production of ceramic insert for a machining tool according to the invention. The sole Figure shows an important use, namely as a cutting insert in a machining zool in a lathe. The machining tool comprises a cera mlc insert 1 clamped in the usual way in a holder 2 . 25 kg aluminium oxide powder having an average rystallite size of 0.3 um is placed in a ball mill having ubber linedwalls. The powder had been prepared by caleining ammonium aluminium alum NH4Al SO4 0.12h2O . The powder is compacted to agglomerates by milling with 200 kg aluminium oxide balls, having a diameter of 3.6 cm for 8 hours Zirconium oxide to which nickel acetate and grinding means consisting of rejected ceramic insert material according to the invention has been added is wet milled for 1 2 hour in a vibratory mill, whereafter the has a particle size approximately 750 by weight of which is between 1 and 3 um.A typical mill batch has theSollowing composition 353 g zirconium oxide, 3.33 g wickel aceuate. 800 g deionized water. AD milling this mixture for 2 hour the following components are added to the contents of the vibratory bas mill g aluminium oxide which had been dry milled as dessined above, g defonized water and 88 g of a 55 by weight polymethyl methacrylate emulsion water commercial product as a binder. et milling for 30 minutes, the resulting suspension as passed through a 36 um sieve and the sieved suspension as granulated by spray drying. The granulate thus obtained As a poured powder density of 1.10 1.20 g cm3. The ranulate isshaped with a pressure of 3000 kg cm2 to a ceramie insert for a nmachining tool, the granulate being wetted with 3 by weight of deionized water immediately prior to pressing. The pressed density is 2.50 2.60 g cm3. Thepressed products are thereafter sintered in a continuous furnace in air at a peak temperature of 1550 16000C for 1 to 2 hours. The shrinkage during this sintering operation is 16 to 17 and the density of the sintered material is 4.26 g cm3, from which it can be computed that the porosity is approximately 0.5 by volume. The average crystallite size is 3.03.5 um. After sintering the product is ground to size in accordance with the relevant standards. The ceramic insert thus obtained is tested by using it to turn a plurality of workpieces of different shapes and different materials on a lathe and to compare the results with those obtained with a ceramic insert having an identical shape but consisting of sintered aluminium oxide of the same quality as defined above, but without the addition of zirconium oxide. The materials used for the workpieces are cast iron and unalloyed carbon steel. The workpieces consist of rods having one or more grooves extending longitudinally in the outer surface, so that the ceramic insert is subjected to a heavy load. It was found that a ceramic insert according to the invention had a tool life which was 3 to 5 times as long as those of the aluminium oxide ceramic insert. Comparable results are obtained with ceramic insert material containing one of the other above mentioned oxides instead of nickel oxide.
