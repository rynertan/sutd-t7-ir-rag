# Excess voltage arresters.

## Abstract
An excess voltage arrester 1 to 21 provided with an overheating protection device comprising a resilient electri cally conductive first member 23 in a flexed condition and a second member 25 of heat softenable electrically insulating material associated with the first member such that on over heating of the arrester the second member softens allowing the first member to move in an attempt to return to its natural shape, and thereby establish an electrically conductive path through itself between the arrester electrodes.
