# Process for preparing epoxy resins having low hydrolyzable chlorine contents.

## Abstract
Low hydrolyzable chlorine containing epoxy resins are obtained by conducting a second dehydrohalogenation of the resin in isopropanol or secondary butanol solvent using aqueous alkali metal hydroxide as the dehydrohalogenating agent. Low hydrolyzable chlorine containing epoxy resins when cured have excellent electrical resistance properties.
