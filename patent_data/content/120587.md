# Crystalline ibuprofen.

## Abstract
Ibuprofen is crystallized from a δH 8 liquid such as a C₁ to C₃ alkanol, e.g., methanol, containing solutions thereof to obtain ibuprofen crystals which are equant cube, sphere or grain in shape, which ibuprofen crystals have larger average particle size, higher bulk density, lower bulk volume and improved flow properties compared to previously known bulk ibuprofen crystalline materials.
