# A device for separating liquid from liquid containing compressed gas.

## Abstract
A device for separating liquid from liquid containing compressed gas. The device comprises two tanks 1,4 one situated above the other. The lower tank 1 is provided with a compressed gas inlet 2 which is directed against a surface 3 of the tank to cause separation of the major part of the liquid. The upper tank 4 is provided with a shell 6 having an access opening 9 at its upper end. The gas flow enters the upper tank 4 through a conduit 12 and passes then through opening 9 and a zigzag shaped channel formed by walls 10,13,14,15 in shell 6 . The gas flow then passes through filter 5,16 . Separation is performed in several steps by change of direction of the gas flow and by filtering. Positioning of the access opening 9 at the top allows considerable expansion of the liquid gas mixture without contamination of the filter 5,16 .
