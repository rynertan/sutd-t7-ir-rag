# Adjustable electromechanical device.

## Abstract
An adjustable electromechanical device, such as a potentiometer, a variable capacitor or a multiple switch, comprising a shaft 3 which is rotatably mounted in a sleeve 2 . The shaft 3 is retained in the axial direction by means of an annular wall portion 6 of the bearing sleeve 2 at the free end of the sleeve, which annular wall portion 6 is spaced from the remainder of the sleeve by at least one but preferably two evenly distributed slots 4 which extend circumferentially in the wall of the sleeve, so that this annular wall portion 6 remains connected to the remainder of the bearing sleeve at at least one location. The free parts of the annular portion 6 are deformed to engage in a circumferen tial groove 5 in the shaft.
