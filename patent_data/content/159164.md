# Sheet dispenser.

## Abstract
A dispenser for sheet material affords the clamping action against the sheet partially dispensed from the contain er to maintain it in a position where it can be grasped and dispensed. The dispenser comprises a cartridge 15 for a stack 16 of sheet material 20 which stack 16 is formed by releasably adhering successive sheets adjacent opposite edges to permit the dispensing of one sheet and the grasping of the next adjacent sheet at the opening to dispose an edge of such sheet to permit the subsequent dispensing of the next sheet. The exit opening enlarges under the dispensing force applied to each successive sheet but removal of the force allows the side walls 36, 37 of the cartridge to return from a pivoted position to the original position, closing the opening and grasping the sheet therebetween. The cartridge is disposed within a housing 10 which contains the cartridge during the movement of the upper or top wall 31, 32 while the sheets are being dispensed.
