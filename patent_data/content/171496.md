## Description
This invention relates to a production process of a chimera monoclonal antibody. More particularly, this invention concerns the production of a chimera monoclonal antibody whose side effects such as anaphylaxis and serum sickness are thought to be greatly reduced especially when it is administered to man. A monoclonal antibody with mono specificity has given a great influence to immunology and its usefulness has already been demonstrated over such sciences as biology, pharmacology, chemistry and others. Concerning its production process, Kohler and Milstein succeeded in realizing in 1975 by fusing mouse spleen cell primed with sheep erythrocytes and mouse melanoma cell See Nature However, since most of monoclonal antibodies are derived from animals except man, they are expected to cause such side effects as anaphylaxis or serum sickness when administered to man because heterologous proteins are injected into a human body. Accordingly, various attempts have so far been made to manufacture human derived monoclonal antibodies by using human hybridoma. Among them are Japanese Patent Publication No. sho 57 126424, sho 57 502090, sho 58 90517, sho 58 128323 and sho 57 50209 for example. These attempts tell us that the production of human derived monoclonal antibodies is certainly possible but it is still insufficient in view of its reproducibility and others. See Nature In this respect, there is an attempt to cause coliform bacillus to produce a human derived monoclonal antibody by inserting a complementary DNA into plasmid pBR 322. The cDNA was made by p chain specific m RNA obtained from human mouse hybridoma that produces human monoclonal antibodies. However, since it is unable to immunize man with various antigens so well as desired, it must be said that there still remains a problem. EP A 0 125 023 discloses a method for producing chimeric antibodies and immunoglobulins, respectively, which are analogous to those normally found in vertebrate systems. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 81, pp. 3273 3277, June 1984, discloses the construction of plasmids from H and or L chains of CEA antibodies directly produced in E. coli. Under the circumstances, the present inventors made various studies to eliminate the above drawbacks and finally have accomplished this invention. That is, this invention concerns a production process of chimera monoclonal antibody consisting of a variable region derived from mouse and a constant region derived from man, which is characterized by comprising a inserting into an expression vector active genes V It is an object of this invention to provide a production process of a chimera monoclonal antibody whose side effects such as anaphylaxie shock and serum sickness are greatly reduced by combining a variable region derived from mouse and a constant region derived from man because most of conventional monoclonal antibodies are derived exclusively from animals except man and expected to be a cause of such side effects as anaphylaxis shock and serum sickness upon administering to a human body on account of being heterologous proteins. This production process can be industrialized offhand with a reduced cost and safety. The above and other objects and features of this invention will appear more fully hereinafter from a consideration of the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein one example is illustrated by way of example. The term active V Hybridomas, cloned B cells and B cells transformed with Epstein Barr virus are employed preferably as the antibody producing cells and vectors pSV2 gpt, pSV2 neo and SV40 are favorably used as the expression vector . Moreover, any one of lymphoma cells, kidney cells, L cells, COS cells and HeLa cells derived from mouse can be used as the cultured animals cells . In the meantime, according to the present invention, mice are so easy to immunize that any desired chimera monoclonal antibody can be obtained at the same time, it is naturally expected that the antigenicity of heterologous immunogloblin proteins is greatly reduced in the use of the chimera monoclonal antibody of this invention, compared with other derived from animals only. The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the following example. Hybridoma D10, formally designated M2590, is the fused cell between the recipient tumour cell, P3U1, and the spleen cell derived from the C57BL 6 mouse which were immumized with B 16 melanoma cell that had been generated spontaneously in C57BL 6 mouse. D10 secretes the antibody which veacts with melanoma cells selectively. The type of this antibody is IgM for heavy chain and Kappa for light chain. At first, DNA is isolated from D10, P3U1 and C57BL 6 mouse kidney, respectively See Cell As is apparent from Fig. 1A a , there exist three rearranged bands at 6.5, 6.3 and 6.1 Kb in D10 DNA. The two bands at 6.3 and 6.1 Kb are the same as the one found in P3U1 DNA. The band at 6.5 Kb is an active gene containing the V The Hind III inserted VJ Fig. 1A c shows the southern hybridization of J Based on the reason mentioned above, DNA at 5.5 Kb, which is found only in D10 which contains a functional gene in variable region of H chain is cloned by λ phage EcoRI vector λgt WES λB, See P. Leader, Science The C gene of the IgG₁ class which is the major immunogloblin class in human blood serum is isolated. Inasmuch as the necleotide sequences in genes of human immunogloblin has a great resemblance to that of mouse immunogloblin, C P Pvu II fragment at 1.9 Kb which contains an enhancer elements and human C After a 50 50 mixture of Hind III and BamHI linker produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. has been ligated to it, the built up product is digested with Hind III. Fragment thus obtained is ligated with a Hind III inserted fragment at 6.5 Kb which is isolated from VJ Fragment with 8.2 Kb Kind III insert is isolated from HG 163 clone. Both its ends are converted to blunt end with Klenov enzyme and digested with EcoRI linker produced by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. . After that, the fragment is digested with EcoRI and BamHI and inserted into EcoRI and BamHI cleaved plasmid pSV2 gpt. In this way, the clone, pSV2 HG14, containing human C Both DNAs pSV2 HC The solution A and the solution 2xHeBS have the following composition. In order to select a transformed cell producing a chimera monoclonal antibody, the enzyme linked antibody method and the analysis by means of the cell Sorter, FACS a product of Beckton Deckinson Co., Ltd. , are employed. Eighteen clones of transformed cells are selected by the use of a selective culture medium which contains mycophenolic acid. The plasmacytoma P3U1 and the eighteen clones of transformed cells are kept on growing to the full in a plate containing the selective culture medium. Supernatant of these culture media are subjected to the enzyme linked antibody method Meth. Enzymol. It becomes clear that 1x10⁷ HMH S7 cells secreate about 100 ng ml of mouse human chimera monoclonal antibody in 10 ml of the supernatant of their culture medium. HMH cells and the plastocytoma P3U1 are washed twice in Hank s balanced salt solution Gibco . The cells 10⁷ are put in a solution composed of 750 µl of staining buffer solution and 250 µl of rabbit anti human immunogloblin antibody or 1 µg ml of normal rabbit IgG. The solution is incubated at room temperatures for one hour. After that, the cells are washed three times in Hank s balanced salt solution. Procedures thereinafter are the same as those written in the avidine biotine kit, put on the market by Vector Laboratory Co., Ltd. In brief, the cells are put in 250 µl of a 1 200 human IgG treated, biotine conjugated anti rabbit IgG 1.5 mg ml and is incubated at room temperatures for one hour. Subsequently, it is washed three times with Hank s solution, put in 250 µl of a 1 20 avidine FITC 5 mg ml , and then incubated at room temperatures for 30 minutes. Again, it is washed three times with Hank s solution. Finally, 10⁶ cells are put in 1 ml of a culture medium and subjected to the analysis by the fluorescence activated cell sorter FACS IV equipped with a logarithmic amplifier, manufactured by Beckton Dickson Co., Ltd. The result is shown in Fig. 3. In the FACS analysis, HMH cells are used as target cells and rabbit IgG is used as control. That is, in Fig. 3, a shows HMH cells reacted with rabbit anti human Ig antibody, b reacted with rabbit anti human In accordance with the aforementioned method, DNA and Poly A containing RNA are isolated from HMH cells. Like DNA isolated from HMH cells, DNA isolated from C57BL 6 mouse kidney cells and P3U1 cells is digested with BamHI and subjected to the southern hybridization by means of mouse J With regard to human C According to these facts, it is obvious that HMH cells possess both heavy and light intact chimena genes in the genome. Poly A containing m RNAs isolated from HMH cells and P3U1 are caused to make northern blotting with VJ A 5 Kb band is detected as m RNA primary transcript, from which intron in not removed because splicing has not occurred yet. See Figs. 4B a and b . Two bands are detected at 3.5 and 7 Kb with the aid of VJ As best seen from the above, it becomes evident that in portions of primary transcripts RNA splicing does occur between mouse derived V D J exons and human derived exons in HMH cells. Although the invention has been described in its preferred from with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure of the preferred form has been changed in the details of construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.
