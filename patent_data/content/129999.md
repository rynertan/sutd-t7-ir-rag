## Description
A DENSE PHASE HYDRAULIC LIFT PROCESS A number of process systems employ fluid solid particles in which the solid particles need to be transported and lifted from the bottom of a column back to the top of the same column or to the top of a different column. Processes which employ such fluid solid particles include catalytic processes, adsorption desorption separation processes, coal liquification, etc. These solid particles can be maintained in a fluid state by fluidization with gas or liquid or by maintaining the solid particles in a slurry. Commonly, to transport such fluid solid particles either slurry pumps, pneumatic transports or dilute phase hydraulic transports are used.However, one drawback encountered with these transport methods is that excessive attrition of the solid particles is caused due to the mechanical moving parts of the pump or the high velocity turbulence under which the solid particles are subjected to during transportation. Indicative of prior art transport systems isU.S. Patent 1,598,558 in which granular material is fed into a device where it is first struck by liquid which passes by at a considerable velocity and then air under pressure is also injected to force the granular materal along. Another high velocity pneumatic type of transport is described in U.S. Patent 2,575,258 where catalyst solids flowing downward are met by a blast of gas which causes the catalyst solids to flow up line to a regeneration vessel. This type of pneumatic transport is still common as is described in U.S.Patent 4,247,987 in which descending magnetically stabilized fluidized particles upon leaving one vessel are transferred to another vessel via a stand pipe and transfer pipe facilitated by a lift gas. while these processes are effective to transport the fluid solid particles, one drawback is the rough handling these solid particles receive which can cause attrition of the solid particles. In processes where the solid particles need to be continually used and structural integrity of the solid particles is important, attrition has become a serious problem. Examples of such processes include catalytic processes, adsorption desorption separation processes, etc. in which a catalyst or adsorbent particle is reused and where the process employs fluidized beds or magnetically stabilized fluidized beds.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, this invention involves a hydraulic lift process for continuously and uniformly transporting a dense phase of solid particles in a liquid medium from the bottom of a column to the top of a column while minimizing the attrition of the solid particles. This process is carried out by feeding the dense phase from the column to a transport line which is initially directed downward and which has a smooth curved U shape at the bottom to direct the flow of the dense phase to the top of the column.The flow of the dense phase in the transport line is achieved by injecting into the transport line in the direction of the flow an amount of fluid effective to reduce the density of the solid particles in the dense phase to provide sufficient pressure to lift the solids to the top of the column, with the change of density between the column and the transport line providing the driving force for the flow of the dense phase in the transport lineBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure I represents a vertical cross sectional view of a column containing a fluidized bed with a transport line which lifts a dense phase of solid particles fron the bottom of the column to the top of the column.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The transportation of fluid solid particles from the bottom of one column to the top of the same or a different column has typically been achieved by injecting into the transport line a gas under high pressure to force the fluid solids along at considerable velocity. This technique typically results in substantial attrition of the solid particles due to the considerable force of impact of collisions between the solid particles and the transport tube and between the solid particles themselves.By this invention, a hydraulic lift process is achieved which transports the particles from the bottom of one column to the top of the same or a different column in a gentle manner thus substRntially decreasing the attrition of solid particles. By hydraulic what is meant is that a liquid is used to move or drag the solid particles upwards. This invention achieves a gentle and uniform movement of a dense phase of solid particles in a liquid medium by the critical combination of a transport line configuration and applying a pressure balance between the column and transport line by injecting a relatively small amount of fluid containing liquid into the transport line to reduce the density of solid particles to provide sufficient pressure to lift the solids to the top of the column. This process significantly reduces the handling of the solid particles as compared to a mechanical pump and increases the uniformity of flow while significantly reducing the velocity of the solid particles as compared to a pneumatic transport thereby reducing attrition to the particles.In addition, as a hydraulic process is employed to convey the solid particles in a liquid medium, the liquid itself acts to cushion the collisions of the solid particles thereby reducing attrition. In general the solid particles to be transported can vary in shape, e.g. a sphere, cylinder or disc. The particles will generally have a particle size in the range of 50 to 1000 microns, preferably 100 to 400 microns and a bulk density of 0.5 to 2.0 gms. per cubic cm, preferably 0.8 to 1.5 grams per cubic cm. The pressure balance between the column and the transport line can be defined as the pressure head available in the main column should equal to the pressure head required in the transport line to transport solids. The pressure head available in the main column and the pressure head required in the transport line can be defined by the following equations Pt.col Ph Pf1 Pf2 AP.tr APn QPv APfl APf2 hPva Where k. col Pressure head available in main column Pt .tr Pressure head required in transport line static head Pv velocity head losses APfl friction loss between fluid and pipe APf2 friction loss between solids and pipe, between solids and fluid, and between solids and solids. Pressure drop across the valves Referring to Figure I the critical configuration of the transport line can be readily seen. The solid particles from the column are continuously fed into the transport line. The transport line is initially directed downward to accept the particles from the column with the transport line then having a smooth curved U shape at the bottom to redirect the flow of the solids to the top of the column. The transport line can be redirected up inside the column, although the transport line is preferably outside the column as shown in Figure I. The radius of the U shape of the bottom of the transport line is generally from 0.5 to 20 preferably 1 to 5 times the radius of the main column, and the diameter of the transport line is generally 0.03 to D. 9, preferably 0.03 to 0.25 times tne diameter of the main column to facilitate the uniform flow of the dense phase.Preferably, the bottom of the transport line has no substantially flat horizontal surface which aids in preventing the accumulation of solid particles thus promoting uniform flow. This smooth curved U shape of the transport line is critical to preventing attrition which is caused in the angular or V shaped junctures of the transport systems corrnon in the prior art. The U shape permits the dense phase of solid particles to flow uniformly and prevents interruptions of flow, as compared to the transport systems of the prior art in which at the anqular juncture of the transport line an injection of gas or liquid under high pressure is made which forces the particles along at higher velocity causing collisions with slower moving solid particles resulting in attrition, as well as causing suction or vacuum in the transport line at the angular juncture which interrups the flow of the solid particles. Also important to the configuration of the transport line is the injection of the fluid which is carried out in the direction of flow of the dense phase of solid particles. This injection of fluid is carried out in a rranner which does not interrupt the flow of the solids in the transport line and although it can be injected midway up the trançrt line, it is preferably made at a tangent to the curve of the Phase of the transport line, preferably at the bottom or miaid curve of the wshape. Single or multiple injection can be used. Key to this invention is the pressure balance which is maintained between the column and the transport line. This pressure balance provides the major driving force for the flow of the dense phase of solid particles in the transport line which is carried out by injecting a relatively small but effective amount of a fluid into the dense phase in the transport line effective to reduce the density of the solid particles in the dense phase to provide sufficient pressure in the transport line to lift the solids to the top of the column. Critically, it is the change of density of the solids in the dense phase which provides the driving force for the flow of solid particles in the transport line.While the fluid must be injecte d at a sufficient pressure to allow the fluid to enter the transport line, this pressure and velocity of the injectea fluid is not sufficiently high to cause interruption of the flow of the dense phase in the line thereby causing s i gni f.icant attrition of the solid particles. preferably the velocity of the fluid injected into the transport line is not significantly higher than the velocity of the solid particles in the transport line and te pressure at which the fluid is injected into the transport line is l.l to 2.0 times the injection point pressure in the transport line.significantly, the fluid velocity or pressure under which the fluid is injected to the transport line will provide only a minor driving force to lift the solid particles to the top of the column. The major driving force to lift the solids is the drag force of the liquid on the solids provided by the pressure differences between the main column and transport line which is achieved by the reduction of density of solid particles in the transport line. This invention provides a process for transporting a dense phase of solid particles in a liquid medium. This dense phase contains solid particles at a level of at least 20 by volume of the dense phase, preferably 40 to 60 .When fluid is injected into the transport line, the density of the dense phase is substantially reduced to a level of at least 5 , preferably 15 to 35 by volume of solid particles in the dense phase. The fluid contains liquid, butcanaddi tionally contain gas. Preferably when the liquid is injected, the level of solid particles in the dense phase is reduced by 15 to 75 by volume. The liquid which is injected can have a viscosity ranging from 0.1 to 2.0, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 centipoise with a specific gravity generally ranging from 0.1 to 2.0, preferably 0.4 to 1.0 gms cubic cm. Through the lift process of this invention, the velocity at which the particles are transported is significantly reduced compared to pneumatic transport systems.While the flow of the dense phase in the transport line is at a velocity greater than the termin21 velocity, i.e. a velocity sufficient to lift or drag the solid particles to the top of the column, the velocity is minimized to reduce the attrition of the solid particles. The flow velocity of the dense phase in the transport line is generally at a linear velocity of between 0.1 and 60 cm per second and preferably of between 1 and 30 cm per second, it being understood that this flow velocity of the dense phase is dependent upon the diameter of the transport line and the amount of solid particles to be transported. The hydraulic lift process for transporting a dense phase of solids in a liquid medium is suited for recycling solid particles to be reused in processes such as a catalytic process the catalyst is the solid particle and an adsorption desorption separation process the adsorbent is the solid particle . The hydraulic lift process is particularly suited for processes employing fluidized beds of solid particles, especially a controllably transported magnetically stabilized fluidized bed where the solid particles are magnetizable e.g. contain a ferromagnetic component .EXAMPLE 1 A comparison between a pneumatic conveying system and the hydraulic dense phase lift process of this invention is made as follows. Both the hydraulic and pneumatic processes were set up as shown in Figure I. The solid particles moved downwards by gravity in a 2 inch internal diameter X 9 foot 5 cm x 275 cm column while lic n7id was injected and moved upwards in the column to create a countercurrent fluidized moving bed system. In the column, the density of the solid particles in the liquid phase was 50 by volume with the solid particles flowing downward at a linear velocity of 5.1 cm min. The solid particles which were used passed through a 60 mesh U.S. Standard screen but were retained on a 200 mesh U.S.Standard screen and had a density of 0.95 gms cubic cm.The liquid used in the column was a mixture of 25 wt. toluene and 75 wt. 96 paraffins Cl2 c15 and the liquid flow rate in the column was 70 cc min. The operating temperature was ambient. At the bottom of the column the solids were lifted back to the top of the column by a 1 2 inch 1.3 cm diameter transport line with a radius for the curved U shaped bottom of the transport line of 7 inches 17.8 cm . The pneumatic conveying process injected nitrogen into the transport line at a flow rate of 0.0035 standard M3 min., this pressure being chosen to provide sufficient force to lift the solids in the transport line while maintaining the linear velocity of the particles in the column. The resultant linear velocity of the solid particles in the transport line was 37 cm sec and the density of the solid particles in the transport line was 1 by volume. The hydraulic dense phase lift process injected liquid 25 wt. toluene and 75 wt. paraffins creating a liquid flow rate in the transport line of 100 cc min., while maintaining the linear velocity of the particles in the column. The resultant linear velocity of the solid particles in the transport line was 2 cm sec. and the density of the solid particles in the transport line was 34 by volume. The following is a comparison of the size distribution of fresh sieve and used sieve after 80 hours of circulation with the hydraulic lift process as compared to a pneumatic conveying system.
