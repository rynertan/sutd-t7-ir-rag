# Engagement modulator for torque converter bypass.

## Abstract
A viscous coupling 30 adapted to be positioned within the housing 22 of a torque converter automatic transmis sion 11 for use as a bypass of the torque converter 15 and including an annular clutch lining 37 secured to a side face of the outer peripheral portion 32a of the coupling and a control valve assembly 60 positioned in the outer peripher al portion to cushion the impact of engagement of the annular clutch lining 37 with the confronting surface 22a of the torque converter housing 22 . The control valve assembly 60 includes a rolling diaphragm 66 which extends across the open end of an axially extending bore 62 in the outer peripheral portion 32a and is arranged to rollingly traverse the bore 62 to successively cover or uncover a series of axially spaced leakage holes 70 communicating with the main chamber of the torque converter and the bore 62 . The end of the bore 62 remote from the diaphragm 66 communicates with the side of the coupling 30 carrying the annular clutch lining 37 at a location radially inwardly of the clutch lining 37 so that, upon initial engagement of the coupling 30 , leakage flow may occur through the leakage holes 70 from the main chamber of the torque converter to the other side 58 of the coupling to cushion the impact of the clutching engagement and the leakage flow is thereafter gradually cut off to apply the full clutch force as the rolling diaphragm 66 traverses the bore 62 to successively cover the leakage holes 70 .
