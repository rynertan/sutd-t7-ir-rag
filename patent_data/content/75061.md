# Method, chuck and rotary tool to be used when making a hole in a workpiece.

## Abstract
A method is provided for drilling a hole and machining at least the opening end of the hole without a change of tool. First a through hole is drilled by means of a special tool 6 and then the same tool is moved sideways by means of a special chuck 30 which guides the tool during machining of the drilled hole. The chuck is provided with a locking means 37 which, when engaged, holds the chuck in a drilling position and which, when disengaged, allows side ways motion of a tool mounted in the chuck. On the tool used, the longitudinal section of the tool to be located within the hole during the machining operation is situated within a curved surface having a radius just as great as that of the drill and having its centre of curvature on the line about which the tool rotates during drilling.
