## Description
This invention relates to novel bis triazole derivatives which have antifungal activity and are useful in the treatment of fungal infections in animals, including humans, and as agricultural fungicides. According to the invention, there are provided compounds of the formula EMI1.1 whre R is naphthyl, biphenylyl, or phenyl optionally substituted by 1 to 3 substituents each independently selected from F, C1, Br, 1, CF3, C1 C4 alkyl and C1 C4 alkoxy or R is a 5 chloro pyrid 2 yl group and X is F, C1 or Br and their pharmaceutically and agriculturally acceptable salts. Preferably, R is phenyl substitued by 1 to 3 substituents, most preferably 1 or 2 substituents, each independently selected from F, C1, Br, I and CF3. In particular, R is phenyl substituted by 4 chloro, 6 bromo, 4 fluoro, 4 iodo, 4 trifluoromethyl, 2 chloro, 2,4 dichloro, 2,4 difluoro, 2 chloro 4 fluoro, 2,5 difluoro, 2,4,6 trifluoro or 4 bromo 2,5 difluoro. Most preferably, R is 2,4 dichlorophenyl, 2,4 difluorophenyl, 4 bromo 2 , 5 d ifluorophenyl, L iodophenyl, 4 chlorophenyl or 5 chlorcpyrid 2 yl. C3 and CA alkyl and alkoxy groups can be straight or branched chain. The preferred biphenylyl group isEMI2.1 The most preferred individual compound is 1,3 bis lH 1,2,4 triazol l yl 2 bromo 2 2 ,4 dichlorophenyl propane. The compounds of the formula I can be prepared by the halogenation of the corresponding hydroxy compounds of the formula EMI2.2 The halogenation is carried out according to conventional procedures, e.g. using SOCl2, SOBr2 or diethylaminosulphur trifluoride Et2NSF3 as appropriate. In a typical procedure utilising thionyl chloride or bromide, the propanol II in a suitable solvent, e.g. dry acetonitrile, is reacted with thionyl chloride or bromide at a temperature of from OcC to reflux temperature, optionally in the presence of a base, e.g. imidazole. The product I can then be isolated and purified in a conventional manner. The reaction using diethylaminosulphur trifluoride is typically carried out at a temperature of from about O C to room temperature, preferably in methylene chloride as the solvent.Again the product can be isolated and purified conventionally. Many of the starting materials of the formula II are known compounds see published British Patent Applications nos.2,099,818A and 2,078,719A . The starting materials of the formula II in which R is 5 chloropyrid 2 yl are described and claimed in our copending U.K. application no. 8217114. Typical methods to the starting materials are as follows EMI3.1 The methylide can be prepared from trimethylsulphoxonium iodide and either sodium hydride or cetrimide sodium hydroxide,EMI3.2 The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The composition is preferably for human use and in tablet, capsule, injectableor ointment form. The invention yet further provides a plant or seed antifungal composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, together with an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier. In addition the invention provides a method of treating an animal, including a human being , plant or seed having a fungal infection, which comprises treating said animal, plant or seed with an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or with, respectively, a pharmaceutically or agriculturally acceptable salt thereof. The invention further provides a compound of the formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in treating a fungal infection in a human being. The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts are the acid addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are those formed from strong acids which form non toxic acid addition salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide and sulphate. The salts may be obtained by conventional procedures, e.g. by mixing solutions containing equimolar amounts of the free base and desired acid, and the required salt is collected by filtration, if insoluble, or by evaporation of the solvent. The compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are very active arti fungal agents, useful in combating fungal infections in animals, including humans. For example they are useful in treating topical fungal infections in man caused by, among other organisms, species of Candida,Trichophyton, Microsporum, or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infections caused by Candida albicans e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis . They may also be used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida albicans,Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma or Blastomyces. The in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds I can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration m.i.c. which is the concentration of the test compound in a suitable medium at which growth of the particular microorganism fails to occur. In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration are inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for 48 hours at 370C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence or growth of the fungus and the appropriate m.i.c. value is noted. Other microorganisms used in such tests can include Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus,Trichophyton spp, Microsporum spp, Epidermophyton floccosum,Coccidioides immitis, and Torulopsis glabrata. The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice which are inoculated with a strain of Candida albicans. Untreated mice die within 48 hours and the dose level at which the compound provides 50 protection against the lethal effect of the infection PD50 is noted. For human use, the antifungal compounds of the formula I or salts thereof can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they may be administered orally in the form of a tablet containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in a capsule or ovule either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of an elixir or suspension containing a flavouring or colouring agent. They may be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, it is expected that the daily dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the formula I will be from 0.1 to 5 mg kg in divided doses when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus tablets or capsules of the compounds can be expected to contain from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate.The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, by individual instances where higher or lower usage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. Alternatively, the antifungal compounds of formula I can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10 , into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required. The compounds of the formula I and their salts also have activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including for example various rusts, mildews and moulds, and the compounds are thus useful for treating plants and seeds to eradicate or prevent such diseases. The in vitro evaluation of the activity of the compounds against plant fungi can be determined by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations in the same way as previously described except that the plates are incubated at 300C for 48 hours or longer before being examined for the presence or absence of growth. Micro organisms used in such tests include Cochliobolus carbonum, Pyricularia oryzae, Glomerella cingulata, Penicillium digitatum, Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani. For agricultural and horticultural purposes the compounds and their ag iculturally ncceptable salts are preferably used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be supplied in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they are manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures.The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly.to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack.
