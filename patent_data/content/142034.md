# Traveling wire electroerosion machines with double floating nozzle assemblies.

## Abstract
A double floating nozzle assembly for TW electroerosion in which an inner movable nozzle and an outer movable noz zle are slidably supported by a hollow base member 5 hav ing a first and a second internal fluid passage 6a,6b,6c,7a,7b,7c flooded with a pressurized machining liquid medium in a first and a second inlet flow F₁, F₂ respec tively. The inner nozzle is constituted by a first hollow body 16 surrounding a traveling electrode 1 and ending with an outlet portion 17 forming a first annular face 18 adjacent the workpiece 2 and defining a principal nozzle orifice 19 for discharging the liquid medium of the first flow F₁ about the electrode 1 . The hollow body 16 is movably supported by the base member 5 so as to be thrusted outwards thereof to urge the outlet portion 17 towards engagement with the workpiece 2 against pressure in constituted fluid passages created outside the principal nozzle orifice 19 and defined with the workpiece 2 . The outer movable nozzle is consti tuted by a second hollow body 20 surrounding the first hollow 16 body so to be movable independently thereof and ending with an outlet portion 21 forming a second annular face 22 adjacent the workpiece 2 and defining with the first mentioned outlet portion 17 an annular, auxiliary nozzle orifice 23 for discharging the liquid medium of the second inlet flow F₂ about the liquid medium being discharged through the principal nozzle orifice 19 . The second hollow body 20 is supported by the base member 5 so as to be thrustable outwards thereof to urge the second annular face 22 towards engagement with the workpiece 2 against pres sure of the discharged liquid medum flowing between the second annular face 22 and the workpiece 2 .
