# ROTARY KNIFE CONTROL

## Abstract
A cylindrical, rotating knife is positioned to cut a moving body of flat sheet into predetermined lengths. An electric motor rotates the cylindrical knife. The knife motor is controlled by a system responsive to the travel of the sheet passing under the knife and the rotation of the knife, itself. The two measurements are fed to a control circuit to produce an output analog electrical signal to the knife motor which varies the rotational speed of the knife during the cutting cycle to avoid wastage of the sheet as it is cut.
