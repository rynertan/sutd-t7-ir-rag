## Abstract
With this structurally most simple device that is suitable to be used even for craft of small dimensions, it is possible to recover immediately, without any effort, submerged bodies in general, and anchors in particular. The device comprises a float 2 of a volume in proportion with the weight of a submerged body 5 to be recovered, a sheave device 3 that is hung on to the said float 2 and can enter into sliding engagement with a connecting cable 4 running between the said body 5 to be recovered and a boat 6, and means 10 for restraining the said cable 4, designed to allow it to slide in one single direction on the said sheave device 3.
