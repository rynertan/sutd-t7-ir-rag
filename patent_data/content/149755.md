# Optical information recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical information recording and reproducing apparatus for recording and reproducing information on and from an optical recording disk having an optically detectable guide track divided into a plurality of sectors is disclosed. When a sector to or from which a data is to be recorded or reproduced is a defective sector or a non use sector because of updating, the sector must be processed such that it is discriminated in a reproduction cycle. A special pattern signal is recorded on the defective sector or the non use sector, and if the recorded special pattern signal is detected in the reproduction cycle, that sector is determined as the defective or non use sector and recording or reproducing on or from that sector is inhibited.
