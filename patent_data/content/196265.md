# MODULAR ACCUMULATOR INJECTOR

## Abstract
An accumulator injector for injecting discrete pres surized charges of fuel has a modular type configuration. An auxiliary accumulator pressure chamber 70 in the form of a cap 58 is threadably mounted to a main body member 12 . A solenoid valve means 20 for selectively releasing pressure from a control chamber 54 to thereby trigger the injection of pressurized fuel is also removably mounted to the main body member 12 .
