# Process and apparatus for cutting and sealing thermoplastic films or sheets.

## Abstract
A method for reducing wax build up on sealing equip ment where a heated element, such as a hot wire 20 , cuts through and seals adjacent layers 14 , 14 of a film or sheet of thermoplastic material containing thickened thermoplastic sections. The wax build up is related to the contact between the wire and the thermoplastic material. The improvement results from a proper shaping of the wire, by regulating the height of wire elevation with respect to the film and thickened sections, by using a wire having a generally elongated cross sectional shape, and by employing relatively high wire travel speeds whereby it is possible to take advantage of the shrink back characteristics resulting from the orientation built into the thermoplastic material, so that minimum contact between the wire and the thermoplastic material is realized.
