# VOICE CONTROLLED SWITCHING SYSTEM.

## Abstract
Improved voice controlled switching system in which a plurality of voice controlled switches are associated with voice signal transmission lines which are provided between at least two stations having a loudspeaker and a micro phone for receiving and sending signals. The voice con trolled switches 103, 203, 303 are controlled comple mentarily by a plurality of J K flip flops 114, 214, 314 , depending upon the output of each comparator 113, 213, 313 which compares an outgoing signal with an incoming signal. When a new voice message is applied at a certain station, the message being transmitted from other station may be interrupted by the new application of a message so as to transmit the new message to all the stations, except the station sending the message.
