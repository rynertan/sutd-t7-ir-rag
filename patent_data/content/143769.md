# Preparation of ortho aminobenzotrifluoride.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of ortho aminobenzotrifluoride OABT from benzotrifluoride BTF . The process provides an overall route employing non isolation of intermediates which can be run smoothly and which results in the preparation of OABT in high yields with less contamination. This process includes a catalytic hal ogenation step in which BTF is converted to met halo BTF and other mono and di halo isomers of BTF followed by nitra tion in the same reaction vessel under conditions which do not favor nitration of the di halo isomers of BTF to produce a mixture which predominates in 5 halo 2 nitro BTF. In the fi nal step the 5 halo 2 nitro BTF present is reduced and hy drodehalogenated with Hâ‚‚ in the presence of a catalyst to form OABT. Recyclable BTF is also obtained from the final reaction.
