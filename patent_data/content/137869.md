# Derived nisin producing microorganisms, method of production and use and products obtained thereby.

## Abstract
Derived microorganisms containing foreign DNA en coding for nisin production and a method for producing the derived microorganisms by transferring DNA to a recipient microorganism are described. The recipient microorgan isms are preferably bacteria lacking in the ability to produce nisin. Nisin inhibits the growth of spoilage bacteria and is used in various materials for preservation, including foods and particularly at refrigeration temperatures. Nisin is also used in animals for improving the health of the animal. The foreign DNA is obtained from a donor microorganism and encodes for nisin production when transferred to the recip ient microorganism.

## Description
DERIVED NISIN PRODUCING MICROORGANISMS, METHOD OF PRODUCTION AND USE AND PRODUCTS OBTAINED THEREBYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel derived microorganisms and to a method for producing the derived microorganisms which contain foreign DNA encoding for nisin production. In particular, the present invention relates to derived bacteria containing foreign DNA encoding for nisin production. 2 Prior ArtNisin The Merck Index 8th Edition at page 6375 genorally characterizes nisin as a polypeptide antibiotic produced by Streptococcus lactis, citing various publications including Mattick, Hirsch, Nature 154, 551 1944 Lancet 250, 417 1946 and 253, 5 1947 Berridge et al.,Biochem. J. 52, 529 1952 and U.S. Pat. 2,935,503 1960 .The chemical structure is indicated to contain 34 amino acid rsidues, eight of which are rarely found in nature, including lanthionine two alanines bonded to sulfur at the beta carbons and beta methyllanthionine as described byGross, 3. Am. Chum. Soc. 93, 4634 1971 . isin is indicated to form crystals from ethanol and to be soluble in dilute acids. It is stable to aiLing in acid solution.The Aerck Index indicates that nisin is used in food processing and as a preservative, especially for cheese and canned fruits and vegetables. A chemical structure of one form of nisin has been described by Gross and Morrell of the NationalInstitute of Health in Chem. and Eng News Page 18 Sept.24, L973 . The structure includes alpha beta unsaturation in amino acids near the terminaL amino and acid groups. It is speculated that the activity of nisin is related to reaction of the unsaturated amino acids with the sulfhydryl groups of enzymes in the affected microorganisms. Nisin generally has a published molecular weight range between about 6800 and 7500. Nisin is classed as an antibiotic produced by N group lactic acid producing Streptococci.The inventors prefer the phrase inhibitory substance to antibiotic where nisin is generated in situ in a food by the microorganism, particularly by bacteria.Use in Foods Nisin in foods inhibits clostridial spoilage which is a major problem resulting from food storage. In addition, nisin inhibits psychotrophic bacteria which are particularly a problem with refrigerated foods. Thus nisin inhibits Streptococci of Groups A, B, E, F, H, K, M and N,Staphylococci, Micrococcus Bacillus some species Clostridium, Mycobacterium, Lactobacillus, octinomyces and Erysipelothrix. Nisin is particularly effective where the food has been partially heat treated. It is not affected by the presence of foods containing blood serum or milk.It is thus useful in settings where these substances are present in.substantial amounts. At this time nisin can not b added to foods in the United States but is used in many countries elsewhere in the world however, approval is being sought in the United States. It should be noted that nisin occurs naturally in fermented food products where nisin producing strains of Streptococcus lasfis art present, particularly in milk products. Use in foods is described by reedy et aL J. of Food Science 35, 787 791 1970 and in neddy et al J. Food Science 40, 3l4 3L8 1975 . An assay procedure in foods is described byTrainer, J., et al J.

Society For Applied BlcterioLogy, 1975, No. 8 pp 91 105. Strains Various strains of Streptococcus lactis are known to produce nisin, but S. cremoris and S. lactis subspecies diacetilactis do not. Such strains are described in McClintok, H. et al. J. Dairy Research 19, 187 193 1952 Campbell, L. L. et al Food Tech 13 462 464 1959 Hurst J.

Various technical articles have appeared describing nisin producing Streptococcus lactic strains. Included are Geis A, et al Applied Environmental Microbiology 45 205 211 1983 Kozak et al J. of Gen. Microbiology 83 295 302 1974 Pack, et al, J. Bacteriology 149 420 425 1982 McKay, L. et al Applied and EnvironmentalMicrobiology 40 84 91 1980 Hurst A, J.

Environmental Effects and Maintenance Mechanisms, Edited byColin Stuttard and Kenneth R. Rozee, Academic Press, 31 41 1980 . Some of these publications describe the plasmids in Streptococcus lactis and in particular a 28 Mdal plasmid which may encode for nisin production however, non of the publications describe the transfer of the nisin encoding plasmid to non nisin producing recipient bacteria or to other microorganisms A summary regarding nisin appears in Hurst, A.,Advances Applied Microbiology 27 85 123 1981 . This publication describes what is generally known about nisin. A major problem described in the prior art is the phage susceptibility of nisin producing strains ofStreptococcus lactic Another problem is that the nisin is expressed at relatively low levels in the naturally occurring strains oE Streptococcus Zactis and the strains are difficult to grow. Still another problem is that nisin alone.has some limitations of inhibitory activity against food spoilage microorganisms.Objects It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide nisin producing derived microorganisms containing foreign DNA which encodes for nisin production,It is further an object of the present invention to provide a large collection of nisin producing derived microorganisms which have unrelated phage susceptibilities and which generate relatively large amounts of nisin. Also, provided are nisin producing derived microorganisms which can be adapted to become phage insensitive derivatives by direct challenge with phage for selection of insensitive clones without loss of desired functional characteristics, particularly nisin production. Further still it is an object of the present invention to provide nisin producing derived microorganims which can be combined with other inhibitory substance producing microorganisms. The and other objects will become increasingly apparent by reference to the following description.General Description The present invention broadly relates to a novel nisin producing derived microorganism which contains foreign DNA, either chromosomal or extrachromosomal, which encodes for nisin production, which foreign DNA was obtained from a nisin producing donor microorganism and which foreign DNA was transferred to a recipient microorganism resulting in the nisin producing and usually nisin resistant derived microorganism. The present invention particularly relates to a novel nisin producing derived microorganism selected from a derived bacterium, yeast or fungus. The following definitions are used herein 1 the phrase donor microorganism means a parental strain containing transferable DNA which encodes for nisin production, preferably strains of Streptococcus tactics bacteria which naturally produce nisin. 2 The phrase recipient microorganism i means a parental strain which does not naturally produce nisin or which produces relatively low amounts of nisin, preferably a bacterium, and may or may not be sensitive to inhibited by nisin. 3 The phrase derived microorganism means nisin producing strains that result from introducing foreign DNA into a recipient microorganism, preferably from mating a donor microorganism which is nisin producing with a recipient microorganism which is non nisin producing or low nisin producing to increase nisin production, and preferably a bacteria. 4 The phrase foreign DNA means DNA which does not naturally occur in the recipient bacterium The foreign DNA is introduced into the recipient bacterium by the method of the present invention. 5 The phrase inhibitory substance means an antimicrobial agent including nisin produced by a microorganism which prevents the growth of other microorganisms. The present invention particularly relates to a nisin producing derived bacterium selected fromStreptococcus species, Pediococcus species, lactobacillus species, Propionibacterium species, Micrococcus species, Esuconostoc species,Stapr ylococcus species, Clostridium species Flavobacteriu. species, Brevibacterium species, E. coli and peeudornonas species. The present invention further relates to a nisin producing derived yeast selected from Saccharomyces species, especially S. cerevisiae Debaryomyces species, especially D. hansen ii ToruZons s species Brettnomyces species CQndida species Cryptococcus species Kloeckera species Kluyveromyces species and Schizosaccharomces species. The present invention finally relates to the nisin producing derived fungus selected from Penicillium species, Mucor species, Rhizopus species, AspergiZtus species, Deuteromycetes species Ascomycetea species,Geotrichum species and Monascus species. The foreign DNA can be transferred to a recipient microorganism by transformation in the manner described in U.S. Patent No. 4,237,224 to Cohen and Boyer and related patents using splicing of the nisin encodingDNA in a cloning vector. The cloning vectors described inU.S. Patent Nob 4,374,200 to Ronald K. Olsen and similar patents are useful. More conventional conjugal mating of donor and recipient microorganisms, which is preferred, can be used for the transfer. Transduction of the nisin encoding DNA using a virus phage is also possible. The present invention also relates to the method for engineering a nisin producing derived microorganism which comprises transferring DNA, which encodes for nisin production in a donor microorganism, to a recipient microorganism, to result in a nisin producing derived microorganism, wherein the DNA is foreign to the recipient microorganism and encodes Eor nisin production in the derived microorganism and isolating the nisin producing derived microorganism with the foreign DNA. The present invention also relates to a nisin containing product elaborated by the nisin producing microorganism with the foreign DNA. The nisin containing product can contain in addition other inhibitory substances preferably those simultaneously elaborated by the nisin producing derived microorganism. The present invention includes a mixture of nisin, as a pure chemical or a crude nisin containing extract, mixed with a non nisin producingStreptococcus lactis subspecies diacetitacts or a nisin producing derived microorganism which has been selected for resistance to nisin. The present invention further relates to two or more of the nisin producing derived microorganism strains containing the foreign DNA as a mixture, which strains have different phage susceptibilities so as to enable the production of nisin without stringent anti bacteriophage precautions. The strains can be packaged mixed or separately. Finally the present invention relates to the method for treating animals which comprises feeding the animal the nisin producing microorganism which contains the foreign DNA, alone or in admixture with other microorganisms. The present invention is based upon the fact that DNA encoding for nisin production in a donor microorganism can be incorporated into a recipient microorganism as foreign DNA to provide a new nisin producing derived microorganism. The resulting nisin producing derived microorganism is able to preserve foods and other materials and to provide inhibitory substances in animals, particularly birds and mammals, to maintain or improve their health. The nisin producing derived microorganisms containing the foreign DNA can be combined with non nisin producing, nisin insensitive bacteria or other microorganisms preferably those which can produce other inhibitory substances structurally different from nisin. Sometimes nisin can be encoded for in the naturally occurring nisin producing Streptococcus lactic by a plasmid. Also the plasmid DNA encoding for nisin can be incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient bacterium by natural ligation processes, which masses the removal of the characteristic in the derived microorganism difficultThus, in the present invention, the foreign DNA after transfer can be chromosomal or extrachro.mosomal in the derived microorganism. DNA encoding for nisin can be separated from the natural nisin producing Streptococcus lactic in the form of a cleaved fragment or plasmid. This may be accomplished by redigestion oE the nisin encoding DNA. The fragment can then be cloned into a suitable cloning vector and transferred with an introduced DNA into a recipient microorganism. The introduced foreign DNA can also be transferred by transduction of the chromosomal DNA or plasmid DNA using a virus. The plasmid can also be transferred by conjugal mating of related or unrelated genus and species. The term transfer is used herein in its broadest sense to designate any means for placing theDNA encoding for nisin production into a recipient microorganism as foreign DNA.The resulting nisin producing derived microorganism may have multiple copies of the foreign DNA in each cell which can greatly increase the amount of nisin produced per cell subject to cellular limitations as to concentration of nisin. As is known in the art, the derived microorganisms are provided in various preserved forms which increase viability during storage and shipment. Such forms include liquid non concentrated or concentrated cultures, frozen or non frozen cultures and stabilized dried or lyophilized cultures The cultures usually contain biologically pure forms of the derived microorganisms. Amounts of the microorganism over about 106 cells per gram, and preferably over about 1 x 109 cells per gram in preserved form are preferred. Generally, concentrations over 109 cells per gram require means for removal of liquid growth medium from the cells usually by centrifugation or reverse osmosis.Various stabilizing agents such as glycerol, milk powder and the like are used for freezing and Lyophitization. The derived microorganism cells are usually grown in a growth medium including a source of carbon, nitrogen and essential minerals. All of this is well known to those skilled in the art as can be seen from the large body of patent art. SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION The present invention particularly relates to a biologically pure nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium which is not sensitive to nisin and containing plasmid derived DNA, encoding for nisin production from a donor nisin producing Streptococcus tacts wherein the DNA has been transferred to a nisin sensitive recipient bacterium resulting in the nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium. The recipient bacterium is preferablyStreptococcus tacts subspecies diacetilactis. The donor bacterium for S. lactis is preferably Streptococcus Tacts ATCC 11,454 which transfers the nisin trait only to isogenic strains as can be seen from Table 1. Sucrose utilization also is transferred with the nisin trait.A related known nisin producing strain is NRRL B 15,470 NIRD 1404 which could be used. The derived donors are S. tacts , NRRL B 15,459 and NRRt B 15,460 which can transfer the nisin, sucrose trait intergenetically. All of the nisin producing derived microorganisms which are transconjugants can potentially be used as donors of the nisin trait. The reason may be that the plasmid encoding for nisin and sucrose may haven been modified in the primary transfer. The intergenetic recipient bacterium is preferably Streptococcus lactis subspecies diacetilactis NRRL B 15,005, NRRL B 15,006, NRRL B 15,018, NRRL B 12,070 DRC3, cit, lac , and NRRL B 12071 DRC3, lac , cit , and S. lactic NRRL B 15,454, NRRL B 15,452, NRRL B 15,455,NRRL B 15,456, NRRL B 15,457.The resultant nisin producing derived bacterium with the foreign DNA is preferably selected from Streptococcus meat subspecies diacetilactis NRRL B 15,464, and related transconjugants from similar matings 15,465, 15,466 and 15,467 , 15,468 and 15,469 and isogenic bacterial derivatives thereof as described more fully hereinafter with the appropriate antibiotic resistance marker s removed by selection. The present invention particularly relates to a biologically pure nisin and lactic acid producing bacterium which is not sensitive to nisin and which is derived by conjugal mating of a nisin producing Streptococcus tactics donor bacterium containing a plasmid, which codes for the nisin production in the donor bacterium, with a non nisin producing and nisin sensitive lactic acid producing recipient bacterium. The conjugal mating results in the nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium wherein, in some instances, the original plasmid from the donor encoding for nisin production can not be removed as a plasmid from the nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium because of recombination with the host chromosome of the recipient bacterium. The recipient bacterium can be inhibited by nisin prior to the transfer.The plasmid which encodes for nisin production and sucrose fermentation from the donor bacterium preferably measures about 29 Mdal in length and may exist as 29 or altered form i.e. reduced or enlarged or recombined with host chromosomeDNA in the derived bacterium. The present invention particularly relates to the method for producing a nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium which is not sensitive to nisin and which comprises conjugally mating a nisin producingStreptococcus lactic donor bacterium containing a plasmid which codes for the nisin production in the donor bacterium with a non nisin producing and nisin sensitive lactic acid producing recipient bacterium, and isolating the nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium produced by the mating. Further, the present invention relates to an improvement in a method of preserving a material such as a food by incorporating a lactic acid producing derived bacterium into the material which comprises incorporating in the material a nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium which is not sensitive to nisin and containingDNA derived from a plasmid which codes for nisin production from a nisin producing donor Streptococcu3 tactis and which has been transferred to a nisin sensitive recipient bacterium to produce the nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium. The foreign DNA encodes for nisin production and is either integrated into the chromosome or extrachromosomal in the nisin producing derived bacterium.The materials can include all sorts of microbially degradable products for agricultural, industrial, food and other uses including silage, cutting oil and foods. The foods include fresh meat, comminuted, fermented and non fermented meat fresh chicken, fish, milk and other dairy products, commercially prepared salads, vegetables dressings, sauces and other foods subject to spoilage during refrigerated storage. Also, the present invention particularly relates to an improved preserved material produced by incorporating into the material a lactic acid producing derived bacterium or a product produced by the derived bacterium, which comprises 1 a material containing a nisin and lactic acid producing derived bacterium, which is not sensitive to nisin and containing DNA derived from a plasmid which encodes for nisin production from a nisin producing Strew to coccus lactisdonor bacterium which has been transferred to a nisin sensitive recipient bacterium to produce the nisin and lactic acid derived bacterium or 2 incorporating in the material a nisin containing product of such derived bacterium or 3 incorporating in the material a nisin containing product of such derived bacterium along with a microorganism which produces other inhibitory substance but does not produce nisin or 4 incorporating in the material a nisin containing product of such derived bacterium along with a microorganism which produces other inhibitory substances in addition to nisin Finally the present invention particularly relates to a nisin containing product produced by the derived bacterium previously described containing in addition an inhibitory substance from J Streptococcus tactics subspecies d iace ti Zacits. Detailed Description EXAMPLE 1 In order to determine if sucrose utilization and nisin production could be transferred by conjugation, S.lactic ATCC 11454 utilizes sucrose and produces nisin was used as the donor strain in a mating experiment where S.lactis subsp. diacetilactis and S. tactics neither strain utilizes sucrose and neither strain produce nisin were the recipient strains. The mating conditions were as described by Gonzalez and Kunka, Gonzalez, Carlos F., and Blair S.Kunka. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 46 128 132 1983 except that the mating filters were not overlayed with agar.Instead, the filter with the cells facing the agar surface were placed in a BBL Anaerobic Jar with C02 H2 atmosphere for 3 to 4 hours. Transconjugants were selected for the chromosomal resistance of the recipient and ability to utilize sucrose or resistance to nisin 1000 units ml . An isogenic strain of S. tacts ATCC 11,454 was constructed. Strain s. Lactic ATCC 11,454 utilizes lactose and sucrose, and produces nisin was temperature cured of a resident 29 Mdal plasmid by exposure to an elevated growth temperature 400C . This cured strain utilized lactose but did not utilize sucrose and did not produce nisin. Subsequently, this strain was subjected to an additional heat curing at 400C to remove an additional resident 32 Mdal plasmid to result in constructed strain S. tactic ATCC 11,454, which was lactose negative Lac , sucrose negative Suc and did not produce nisin Nis .This constructed strain was designated as S. lactisNRRL B 15,453 Lac , Sud , Nis . NRRL B 15,453, then was exposed to increasing concentrations of streptomycin to obtain a chromosomal mutation for the antibiotic at a concentration of 1000 g ml. This NRRL B 15,453 Smr streptomycin resistant strain was designated as NRRL B 15,454. Strain SRRL B 15,454 was then used as a recipient in the conjugal mating experiments. Table 1 describes the experiments and the results. In these experiments, transfer of sucrose utilization and nisin production only was observed with the isogenic recipient S. lactis NRRL B 15,454. Transfer of sucrose utilization and nisin production intragenerically from S. lactic NRRL B 15,454 to S. lactis NRRL B 15,452 andS. lactic subsp. diacetilactis NRRL B 15,006 Smr was not observed Table 1 Intraspecies Conjugal Matings Transfer frequencies Donor Recipients per donorS. lactis ATCC 11454 S. lactis NRRL B 15452 n S . tactics 1 x 10 5 NRRL B 15 454 S. lactis subsp. diacetilactis NO NRRL B 15006 SmrNO Not Detected Smr Resistance to streptomycin at concentration of 1000 g ml.

Transfer frequency is expressed as the number of nisin resistant and nisin producing colonies per donor colony forming units CFU Donor CFU were determined before mating. Transconjugants were selected for the chromosomal resistance of the recipient and ability to utilize sucrose or resistance to nisin 1000 units ml . EXAMPLE 2 S. tacts ATCC 11,454 was exposed to increasing concentrations of rifamycin to obtain a rifamycin resistant Rifr mutant resistant to 400 g ml . The mutant was used as a recipient in a conjugal mating experiment with a S. sanguis V683 strain which contains the conjugative plasmid pIP501. The resultant transconjugant S. lactisATCC 11,454 Rifr pIP501 was isolated and was designated as S. lactis NRRL B 15,458. S. lactis NRRL B 15,458 along with S. Zactis ATCC 11,454 were used as donors in isogenic and intrageneric matings to determine conjugal transfer of the nisin genes. The mating conditions for the experiments were as described in Example 1 above. Table 2 describes results of matings in which strain S, tactis NRRL B 15,458 was used as a donor and S.lactis NRRL B 15,452, S. lactis NRRL B 15,454 an isogenic strain of S. lactis ATCC 11,454 and S. lactis subs p. diacetilactis NRRL B 15,006 Smr were used as recipients.Transer of plasmid pIP501 was observed to occur in two S. lactis strains, while no transfer was detected to S. Zactis subsp. diacetilactis. Transfer of sucrose utilization and nisin production was observed only to isogenic strain S.lactis NRRL B 15,454 and was at a frequency of 1.4 x 10 3.

One phenotype was lactose negative, sucrose positive and produced nisinThis isolate was designated as S. tactics NRRL B 15,459.The other transconjugant was lactose negative, sucrose positive, produced nisin and contained plasutid pIP501.This isolate was designated as S. tactics NRRL B 15,460. These derived strains, unlike the donor strain, were streptomycin resistant, rifamycin sensitive and did not produce acid from lactose. However, unlike the recipient parental strain the derived strains were now nisin producers and were able to utilize sucrose as a source of carbon to produce acid. Therefore, only isogenic transfer of the sucrose utilizing nisin producing trait was observed by strains S lactis ATCC 11,454 and its pIP501 derivative S. lactis NRRL B 15,458. EXAMPLE 3 S, lactis NRRL B 15,459 was tested for ability to transfer nisin production to S. tactics NRRL B 15,452. Recipient strain NRRL B 15,452 was negative for production of nisin, sensitive to nisin and unable to utilize sucrose as a source of carbon to produce acid. The mating conditions were as described in Example 1 and results are described in Table 3.

Recipient strains NRRL B 15,452, NRRL B 15,455 andNRRL B 15,456 are negative for production of nisin, sensitive to nisin and unable to utilize sucrose as a source of carbon to produce acid.

Many transconjugant, derived strains were isolated from the conjugal matings described in Examples 3 and 4. Derived S. lactic NRRL B 15461 is typical of a transconjugant of S lactisNRRL B 15452. Derived S. Zactis subsp. diacetilactis NRRL B 15469 is typical of a transconjugant of S. Zactis subsp. diacetilactis NRRL B 15456. Table 5 summarizes phenotypic charactistics of transconjugant strains resulting from matings described inExample 4. Transconjugants obtained from each mating were analyzed for selected and unselected markers. Analysis of plasmid content of transconjugants confirmed them as recipient types. Additionally transconjugants were tested for sensitivity to their respective recipient homospecific phages. The transconjugants were lysed by their homospecific phages while donor controls showed no sensitivity.

EXAMPLE 6 Production of nisin by strain S. lactis subs. diacetilactis NRRL B 15464 in comminuted meat incubated at 10 C. To determine production oE nisin by individual colonies of test strains, the colonies were replicated in petri dishes containing peptonized milk agar which had previously been flooded with an 18 hour culture of S.cremoris ATCC 14365. Strain ATCC 14365 is a nisin sensitive strain used to assay nisin production J. Gen.Microbiol. 4 71, 1950 . After 18 hours of incubation, the appearance of zones of inhibition is indicative of nisin production. The method is that of Kozak et al J. Gen.Microbiol. 83 295 302 1974 . The nisin content of meat was determined by TheQuantitative Agar Diffusion Assay used for the estimation and differentiation of nisin in food as described byFowler et al. The Assay of Nisin in Foods. Fowler, G.G.,Jarvis, B., Tramer, J. Aplin Barret Ltd., Yeovil,Somerset, UK, Technical Series, Society for AppliedBacteriology, 1975, No. 8, pp. 91 105. A standard curve was prepared by adding a known concentration oE purified nisin to meat. The meat sample was then treated by the method of Tramer et al. The food extract was assayed by the agar diffusion method and a log nisin concentration vs. zone diameter size curve was plotted. S. cremoris ATCC 14365 was used as the indicator organism. Additionally, strain S. Lactic ATCC 11454, a nisin producing and therefore nisin insensitive, also was used as an indicator organism. Highly purified nisin obtained from Aplin BR Barrett, Ltd. was added to meat samples and nisin concentrations were calculated using a standard cur, The inoculum of test organism was prepared by growing NRRL B 15464 in 500 ml M17 broth Terzaghi andSandine Appl.
