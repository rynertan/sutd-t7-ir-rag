# Separating column for gas chromatography.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating an elution chromatography separat ing column from an elongated capillary tube, such column having a layer comprising a plurality of disunited particles of porous solid material disposed on an inner surface of the tube. The method comprises the steps of preparing a suspension comprising a dispersive liquid and particles of the solid material filling an elongated capillary tube with the prepared suspension and flowing an inert gas through the tube to dry the tube thereby leaving a layer comprising a plurality of disunited particles of the solid material attached to the inner surface of the tube.
