# Circuit breaker.

## Abstract
A circuit breaker in which arc shielding members 14, 15 are provided for predetermined contacts 4, 11 3, 8 among a plurality of contact pairs arranged in parallel, so that the arc will take place between predetermined contacts when the contacts 4, 11 3,8 are opened. The arc shielding members 14, 15 are made of a material having resistivity greater than that of the conductors 10, 2 to which the contacts 4, 11 3, 8 are attached. The arc shielding members 14, 15 work to effectively inject metallic particles of contact material into the arc, so that the arcing voltage is rapidly raised and so that the feet of the arc will not spread to the conductors 10, 2 in the vicinities of the contacts 4, 11 3, 8 .
