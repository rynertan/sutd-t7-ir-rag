# Improvements in melting scrap metal and ingestion of solids in molten metal.

## Abstract
Solid scrap metal particles are ingested into molten metal by use of a linear induction motor which establishes a strong upstream in the molten metal adjacent one boundary wall to establish a standing wave at the surface and a corresponding downstream adjacent the opposite boundary, which is pre ferably in the form of a baffle having a metal outlet passage beneath it. The linear induction motor is conveniently positioned at a sidewell of a melting furnace and a continuous flow of molten metal through the sidewell is established in any convenient way.
