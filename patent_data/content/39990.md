## Description
11BUTYL RUBBER COMPOSICION This invention relates to a butyl rubber composition having excellent mechanical strength as well as high heat resistance, ozone resistance and damping properties, which is prepared by compounding not more than a predetermined amount of carbon black with a rubber blend of butyl rubber and halogenated butyl rubber, a part of which may be replaced by ethylene propylene terpolymer EPT , in a particular blending ratio. Butyl rubbers have mainly been used for tire tubes of vehicles owing to their excellent gas permeability. At the same time, they have been increasingly used for various industrial goods such as steam hoses, belts, fenders, rubber vibration isolators, and vehicle parts owing to their excellent heat resistance, ozone resistance and damping properties. However, butyl rubber has a slow curing rate and poor general properties, so that its use is restricted to a certain extent.In order to overcome these drawbacks, there has been attempted the halogenation of butyl rubber, and as a result chlorinated butyl rubber and brominated butyl rubber in particular have become commercially available, Halogenated butyl rubbers have good mechanical strengths and good curing rates as compared with ordinary butyl rubber, but have low crosslinking densities. The present invention therefore aims to overcome or at least mitigate the above mentioned drawbacks by using butyl rubber together with halogenated butyl rubber in a particular blend ratio. Accordingly, the present invention provides a butyl rubber composition which comprises 90 to 60 parts by weight of butyl rubber, 10 to 40 parts by weight of halogenated butyl rubber, and not more than 50 parts by weight of carbon black based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the said rubber components. In the following description reference will be made to the accompanying drawing, which is a graph showing the relation between the blend ratio of two rubbers and the tensile strength of the resulting rubber composition. In general, it is well known that when combining two kinds of general purpose rubbers, the tensile strength becomes curved downward in accordance with the variation of the blend ratio between the rubbers, as shown by the curve B in the drawing, while when using the most preferable combination of two rubbers, the tensile strength becomes an arithmetically straight line as shown by the curve A ROT, Vol. 49, No.1, 1976, page 112 .On the other hand, it has been found that in accordance with the invention, when a butyl rubber is combined with a halogenated butyl rubber in a blend ratio of 90 10 60 40 parts by weight and carbon black is added thereto in an amount of not more than 50 parts by weight, the tensile strength is superior as compared with the use of the butyl rubber or the halogenated butyl rubber alone, and tends to become curved upward as shown by the curve C in the drawing.Furthermore, it has been found that even when the blend ratio of the butyl rubber and the halogenated butyl rubber is within the above defined range, if the amount of carbon black is not less than 51 parts by weight, the tensile strength becomes related to a straight line corresponding to the curve A in the drawing and hence the desired effect is not obtained in the case of using more than 50 parts by weight of carbon black. The butyl rubber to be used in the invention may be any regular grade usually used. The halogenated butyl rubber is preferably chlorobutyl rubber or bromobutyl rubber. Moreover, the vulcanizate of butyl rubbers as mentioned above is often apt to be softened due to heat aging. Therefore, a part of butyl rubber halogenated butyl rubber combination may be replaced with ethylenepropylene terpolymer EPT capable of curing due to heat aging, whereby the softening tendency upon heat aging can be mitigated as compared with the case of using an unsubstituted butyl rubber halogenated butyl rubber system. In this case, the amount of EPT added is 10 20 parts by weight. If the amount of EPT is outside the above defined range, the addition effect of EPT may not be obtained. To the butyl rubber composition according to the invention is added a curing system of the type used in conventional butyl rubber compositions and other additives such as a softener, and the composition is then cured for use in various industrial goods such as steam hoses, belts, fenders, rubber vibration isolators, and vehicle parts. The amount of the softener added is preferably not more than 15 parts by weight based on the amount of carbon black0 The invention will now be further described with reference to the following illustrative examples.EXAMPLE 1 In this example, a tensile test was made with respect to butyl rubber chlorobutyl rubber compositions and butyl rubber bromobutyl rubber compositions, each having a compounding recipe as shown in the followingTable 1, after curing to obtain a result as shown inTable 1.
