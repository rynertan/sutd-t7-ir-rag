# NUCLEIC ACID PROBES COMPRISING N4 SUBSTITUTED AMINO CYTIDINES

## Abstract
Nucleic acid hybridization probes are provided which comprise an N⁴ substituted amino cytosine moiety, wherein the substituted amino group comprises a tag moiety, whereby the probe is detected. Methods of preparing probes of the invention, intermediates used in such methods, and methods of using the probes of the invention in hybridization assays are also provided. Typical tag moieties employed with the probes of the invention are biotinyl, aminothiadiazole and fluorescein derivatives, connected to N⁴ amino groups of modified cytosines of the probe through linker moieties.
