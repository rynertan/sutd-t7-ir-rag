# SANITARY WASHING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A washing apparatus body 19 provided in a toilet bowl 18 is provtaed with a warm water tank 26 supplied with water by a water supply means, such as a pump 22 or the like a washing change over valve 28 connected to the hot water tank 26 and a least one of a plurality of nozzles 30 , 31 connected to the washing changeover valve 28 . By reducing the length of the water passage between the warm water tank 26 and the nozzles 30 , 31 as much as possible, the warm water supplied from the warm water tank 26 at the start of washing is ejected from the nozzles 30 , 31 within a short time and is sprayed onto the user from the beginning. It is thereby possible to prevent the discomfort of any low temperature water remaining in the water passage being first sprayed onto the user before the warm water is ejected, which usually happens when there is a long water passage.
