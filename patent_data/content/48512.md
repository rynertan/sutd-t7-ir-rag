## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A GRAFT COPOLYMER The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a graft polymer at least partly by bulk or solution polymerizing one or more monomers in the presence of a solution of a substantially saturated rubber. Such a process is described in the US patent specification 3,885,233. The disclosure thereof is incorporated herein by reference.The process according to this specification has been developed for the purpose of improving the grafting degree of the monomers on the substantially saturated rubber. To this end special initiators are applied.This process can be carried out with the otherwise usual polymerization techniques. It has been found that in applying this process and other analogous processes the problem arises that, during the polymerization, at least if carried out in mass or in solution, the viscosity of the polymerization mixture will show a strong increase. This will result, on the one hand, in a substantial increase in the consumption of energy on account of the extra energy required for stirring, while, on the other hand, the properties of the polymer formed may deteriorate by a decrease in homogeneousness during the polymerization. Moreover, it may limit the maximum applicable rubber content. The purpose of the invention, therefore, is to provide a process as described in the preamble, for the preparation of graft copolymers, in which process these problems do not occur. The process according to the invention is characterized in additionaly to said substantially saturated rubber an ethylenevinylacetate copolymer is present during the polymerization. Surprisingly, it has been found that in applying such a process, in which the solution of the rubber, moreover, contains an ethylene vinylacetate copolymer EVA , the increase in the viscosity of the polymerization mixture is substantially smaller than in applying just the rubber. The copolymer of ethylene and vinylacetate may have been pte pared in the usual manner by high pressure 500 5000 bar or by suspension polymerization. The vinylacetate content may range from 5 to 80 by weight. An optimum process, that is an optimum influencing of the viscosity of the polymerization mixture as well as optimum mechanical properties of the product, is obtained with vinylacetate incorporation percentages ranging from 5 to 55 Z by weight. The process according to the invention can be applied to graft polymerization on mass, i.e. the rubber and the EVA are dissolved in one or more of the monomers, or in solution. In the latter case an inert solvent or mixture of solvents is present in which the rubber including the EVA and the monomers are dissolved. As solvents all solvents applicable in solution polymerization, such as aromatic, cycloaliphatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, are in principle suitable. Preferably a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons, or of one or more aliphatic and one or more aromatic hydrocarbons, is used. In addition the process according to the invention can be applied also in mass suspension , solution suspension , emulsionmass polymerization, or in another polymerization technique in which polymerization is at least partly effected in mass or in solution. This means that the invention can also be applied in the socalled precipitation polymerization, in which process polymerization is effected in a polymerization mixture total the solubility of the product Formed has been exceeded. The monomers applicable in the process according to the invention comprise all ethylenicallty unsaturated monomers. In a preferred embodiment one or more monomers are chosen from the group of styrene and or derivatives of styrene, such as halogenated styrene and a methyl8tyrene acrylonitrile and or methacrylonitrile acrylate and or methacrylate maleic anhydride N susbstituted maleimides. As rubber in principle all soluble, substantially saturated rubbers can be used. These rubbers do not contain a considerable quantity of unsaturation in the main chain. Usually the amount of unsaturation is less than 10 unsaturated bonds per 1000 carbon carbon bonds in the main chain. More in particular there are less than 2.5 unsaturated bonds per 1000 C C bonds. Preferred examples of these rubbers are butyl rubber, acrylate rubber, chloroprene, ethylene propylene rubber EP and ethylenepropylene diene rubber. As diene one or more multiply unsaturated compounds can be used such as the not conjugated dienes. Examples thereof are dicyclopentadiene DCPD , hexadiene HP and ethylidene norbornene EN . The polymerization can take place in the presence of the auxiliary materials normally used for radical polymerizations, such as compounds producing free radicals, chain length regulators, redox compounds and the like. The polymerization may be continuous, batchwise or semi continuous. After completion of the polymerization the excess of monomer mass polymerization and or solvent solution polymerization must be removed. This can be done by evaporation in the manner usual for these polymerization techniques. The polymerization is preferably effected in such a manner that the combined rubber EVA content of the graft copolymer obtained is 5 40 Z by weight on average, preferably 10 20 X by weight. This has the advantage that the product of the process has a good impact resistance while retaining good processability. The quantity of copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate preferably amounts to 5 85 Z by weight in respect of the total quantity of rubber and ethylene vinylacetate copolymer jointly, more in particular 5 to 40 by weight. The product obtained by applying the process, according to the invention can be mixed in the usual manner with additives, such as stabilizers, fillers, pigments, lubricants, and antistatics. In addition, the product can be mixed with one ore more other polymers, such as styrene acrylonitrile or a methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymers. The main application of these products lies in the field of objects having good weather resistant characteristics. Consequently it will usually be necessay to incorporate an amount of W stabilizers in the product. A suitable process for W stabilization is given in theBritish patent specification 1,582,280. The invention is also directed to a weather resistant polymer composition comprising 10 100 parts by weight of a graft polymer obtained by polymerizing one or more monomers in the presence of a substantially saturated rubber, 0 90 parts by weight of a rigid copolymer, and 0 5 parts by weight of one or more stabilisers. According to the invention this composition is characterized in that as substantially saturated rubber a mixture of two subs can tially saturated polymers is used, one of which polymers is an ethylenevinylacetate copolymer. Preferably said ethylene vinylacetate copolymer constitutes between 5 and 40 X by weight of said mixture. Surprisingly it has been found that this product has a greatly improved flexural modulus as well as an improved impact strength. The rigid copolymer is by preference a rigid styrene and or methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer. Examples I III and compartive Example A 500 ml of a solution, in heptane, of the polymers mentioned in the tables was fed, in a nitrogen atmosphre, to a three neckd flask provided with stirrer, reflux cooler and thermometer. This solution contained 50 g polymer per litre heptane. During stirring the monomers of styrene and acrylonitrile, in a weight ratio of 70 30 and initiator, bis 4 tert .butyl cyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate, were added, upon which the temperature was raised to the desired value so that the polymerization started. During the polymerization the temperature was kept at a constant value of 55 OC. The polymerization was discontinued by pouring the polymer mixture out into methanol so that the polymer was precipitated. After having been washed and dried, the product of grafting was mixed with such a quantity of copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile prepared separately that the rubber content was 20 by weight. During the polymerization the viscosity variation of the polymer mixture was determined. This viscosity is given in the figure in which the horizontal mixture was determined. This viscosity is given in the figure in which the horizontal axis shows the time expressed in hours and the vertical axis, with a logarithmic scale, the standardized viscosity of the polymer mixture. This viscosity has been calculated by dividing the viscosity at a certain moment by the viscosity at the beginning of the polymerization. The figure clearly shows that, in applying the process according to the invention, the increase in viscosity is substantially smaller so that, during the polymerization, there may be a good mixture and discharge of heat. Moreover, these experiments clearly show that, in applying the process according to the invention, the viscosity variation is such that the rubber content will no longer raise any problems. In applying the process according to the state of the art only relatively low rubber percentages can be applied on plant scale, because problems will arise already at a viscosity ratio of about 20.
