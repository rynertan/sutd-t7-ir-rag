Each slot 22 forms an insert supporting shoulder 30 which extends from the longitudinal axis 18 to the lateral surface 24 of the head 14 . A triangular cutting insert 26 is received in each slot 22 and is sup ported on one side by the shoulder 30 . A pressed dimple 44 extending inwardly of the cutter head 14 from the end face 16 , engages and supports a second side of each of the inserts 26 such that the cutting edges thereof are ac curately positioned at a prescribed diameter.
