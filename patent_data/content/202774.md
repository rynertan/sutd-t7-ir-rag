## Description
The invention relates to new racemic and optically active 1,12b disubstituted octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives. Such compounds display useful cardiovascular activity and are also useful in the preparation of further active compounds. In the literature there are disclosed only 12b substituted 1,2,3,4,5,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives, which do not contain an electron attracting substituent on the carbon atom at the 1 position, and which are prepared from other starting materials using a different route. For example, Shiroyan et al. Arm. Khim. Zh. These methods are, however, not suitable for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention. On the other hand, there are numerous indolo 2,3 a quinolizine compounds substituted on the 12b carbon atom by an alkyl or aryl substituent, which contain for example a methoxy substituent in ring A F.R. Shiroyan et al. Arm. Khim. Zh. Thus, according to one aspect, the present invention provides racemic and optically active 1,12b disubstituted octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I Preferred compounds of formula I according to the invention are selected from the following group allyl 12b methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydro indolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate and the hydro chloride thereof ethyl 1 ethyl 12b methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl12,12b dimethyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydro indolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate and the ethane sulfonic acid salt thereof ethyl 9 bromo 12b methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl 10 bromo 12b methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl 8,9 dibromo 12b methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl 12b methyl 10 nitro 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl 12b methyl 8 nitro 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl 12b methyl 8,10 dinitro 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate ethyl 1 ethyl 12,12b dimethyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate and ethanesulfonic acid salt thereof ethyl 1,12,12b trimethyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate 1 acetyl 12b methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydro indolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 benzoyl 12 methyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydro indolo 2,3 a quinolizine ethyl 12b phenyl 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b octahydro indolo 2,3 a quinolizine 1 carboxylate. The compounds of formula I are valuable intermediates in the preparation of other pharmaceutically active compounds, and are also pharmaceutically active themselves in particular they show cardiovascular, especially peripheral vasodilating activity. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises as active ingredient at least one racemic or optically active 1,12b disubstituted octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I , wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined above, cis, and or trans isomers or physiologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and or excipient. According to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of racemic and optically active 1,12b disubstituted octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I as defined above, wherein a ketone deriv ative of formula III In the above formulae R¹ and R² as halogen represent any halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ as an alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms represent any straight chained or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl, ethyl, X as a leaving group represents any group, which is split off during the reaction with the compound of formula II . Thus X may stand for halogen as defined in connection with R¹ and R², alkylsulfonyl, e.g. methanesulfonyl or arylsul fonyl optionally substituted with alkyl, e.g. p toluene sulfonyl or benzenesulfonyl. By the process according to the invention the new compounds of formula I can be pre pared from commercially available starting materials or from compounds which are easy to prepare, by a simple route. The process according to the inven tion is substantially different from the methods known in the art for the preparation of structural ly related compounds. By the instant process some of the substituents may be incorporated into the target compounds subsequent to the ring closure as well. In the compounds of formula III the presence of R⁶, i.e. of the electron attracting substituent to be attached to the 1 carbon atom of the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine skeleton in the compounds of formula I is significant in many respects. On the one hand, it is due to this group that the substituted ketones of formula III are easy to prepare. These compounds of formula III are preferably β ketoesters or β diketones, and therefore their propyl side chain containing a leaving group in the γ position, necessary for the formation of the ring D, can be easily prepared by the well known, widely employed acetacetic ester or by an analogeous synthesis, and the incorporation of a possible R⁵ substituent is also very simple. On the other hand, the electron attracting substituent makes the formation of 12b substituted indolo 2,3 a quinolizine skeleton substantially easier. Finally, the subsequent substitution of the 1 carbon atom and the subsequent conversions of the compounds of formula I into other pharmaceutically active compounds are rendered possible by this substituent. Most of the tryptamine derivatives of formula II used as a starting material in the process according to the invention are commercially available and can be prepared by methods known in the art. A good summary of these methods is to be found in Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, The substituted ketones of formula III used as a reaction component in the process according to the invention are partly known, partly new, which can be prepared from the β ketoesters of formula IV The 3 bromopropyl side chain in the com pounds of formula III can be built up also by first forming an allyl group by acetacetic ester synthesis or in an analogeous way in the compound of formula IV and then adding hydrogen bromide on the olefin bond, in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, according to the anti Markownikow rule as an analogeous example for alkylmalonic acid ester see M.S. Schechter et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. The 4 substituted acetacetic ester deriva tives of formula IV are generally commercially available but can also easily be prepared by the aid of Meldrum acid 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxane 2,6 dione as to this reaction see Y. Oikawa et al. J. Org. Chem., The β diketones of formula IV either unsubstituted on the α carbon atom, or carrying an R⁵ substituent are commercial products and can easily be prepared by methods known in the art see e.g. H. Adkins et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., The compounds of formula III , in which X as a leaving group represents an alkyl or arylsulfonyl group, can easily be prepared from the corresponding alcohols, i.e. compounds of for mula III , in which X is hydroxyl, by reaction with an alkylsulfonic acid chloride, e.g. methanesulfonic acid chloride or arylsulfonic acid chloride, e.g. An alternative method for the preparation of the β diketones of formula III , in which R⁵ is hydrogen involves preparing a 6 R⁴ 5 R⁷ carbonyl 3,4 dihydro 2H pyrane from a β diketone of formula IV , in which R⁴ and R⁷ are as hereinabove defined and R⁵ is hydrogen, by a 1,3 dihalopropane and treating the compound obtained with an acetic acid solution of hydrogen bromide to yield compounds of formula III , in which R⁴ and R⁷ are as defined above, R⁵ is hydrogen and X is bromine. The 3,4 dihydro 2H pyrane derivatives can for example be prepared by boiling a diketone of formula III and 1,3 bromochloropropane in acetone, in the presence of potassium carbonate, and their purification can easily be achieved by distillation. In the acetic acid solution, under the effect of hydrogen bromide and boiling the dihydropyrane ring will be opened up in several hours, and the product obtained can be separated by distillation, following the elimination of traces of acid. According to the invention the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I , in which R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as defined above, are prepared by condensing and cyclising a tryptamine derivative of formula II , in which R¹, R² and R³ are as defined above, with a sub stituted ketone of formula III , in which R⁴, R⁵, R⁶ and X are as defined above, in an inert organic solvent. Alternatively, the intermediate obtained by the condensation step can be separated, and the ring closure can be carried out as a separate reaction step. If R⁵ has the same meanings as defined in connection with formula I , except hydrogen, as a result of the above condensation a tryptamine derivative of formula V can be isolated as an intermediate product. Thus the present invention provides tryptamine derivatives of formula If, however, R⁵ is hydrogen, this intermediate is immediately converted into the corresponding N indolylethyl 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyridine derivative of for mula VI , which can be isolated, if desired Thus the present invention provides N indolylethyl tetrahydropyridine derivatives of formula VI During the condensation, an inert organic solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, tetraline, biphenyl halogenated hydrocarbons, such as carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene, bromo benzene ethers having a high boiling point, e.g. diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, di The advantage of the latter solution is that no new component is added to the reaction mix ture, and from the salt obtained the tryptamine base of formula II can be easily regenerated and recycled into the reaction. The condensation is carried out by heating at 50 to 180 C, preferably 100 to 140 C, more preferably by boiling in the given solvent. The reaction time, depending on the re action temperature, varies between 5 minutes and 48 hours. If R⁵ is hydrogen, water is formed during the condensation, which is generally eliminated from the reaction mixture. This can be achieved by allowing the solvent employed to distil off slowly from the mixture which involves the elimination of the water, too, but a water separator may also be employed. If R⁵ is other than hydrogen, the cyclisa tion resulting in the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine skeleton starts during the condensation and terminates during the subsequent heating, for example in chlorobenzene for 10 to 15 hours. Alternatively, the product of formula V obtained as a result of condensation may be separated in an appropriate manner, e.g. by chromatography, and the ring closure may be accomplished in a separate reaction step, preferably by boiling in chlorobenzene. The compound of formula I obtained can be isolated from the reaction mixture either as a base or as an acid addition salt by crystalliza tion, or preferably by chromatography. Chromatography is preferably carried out on silica gel, with toluene containing 5 to 15 of diethyl amine. The end product of formula I , if desired, can be further purified by crystalliza tion from hydrocarbons, preferably cyclohexane. If R⁵ is hydrogen, the ring closure yielding the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine skeleton is preferably carried out by filtering off the in soluble acid addition salt of the compound of formula II formed in the condensation step, evaporating the mother liquor, dissolving the residue, containing the intermediate of formula VI , in a lower alcohol, preferably having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol cyclic ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane an ether having a higher boiling point, e.g. diisopropyl ether, di In the ring closure step the acid is employed in an excess amount, preferably in a 5 to 25 fold excess related to the molar amount of the basic components present. The ring closure takes place between 2 minutes and 48 hours, depending on the acid employed and the reaction conditions. The product of formula I is isolated as a base or as an acid addition salt by crystallization, or as a base by chromatography. If the product is isolated in the form of an acid addition salt, crystallization is preferably carried out from the solvent used in the ring closure step. If the product is isolated as a base, the reaction mixture of the ring closure is evaporated, the residue is admixed with water and a water immiscible organic solvent, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, ether, toluene, preferably dichloro methane, whereupon it is rendered alkaline, pre ferably with sodium carbonate and the base is extracted from the mixture with the water immiscible solvent employed. The base can be isolated from the solution in an appropriate manner, for example by evaporation, and if desired, can be further purified by crystallization. If the product formed as a result of ring closure is isolated from the reaction mixture as an acid addition salt, the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I can be set free from that salt in a known manner. The cyclization yields the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I in the form of a cis trans epimeric mixture, which can be separated by crystallization or chromatography, either as a base or in the form of a corresponding salt. The epimer formed in a larger amount is preferably isolated from the reaction mixture by crystallization, and the other epimer, formed in a lower amount, is then isolated from the base mixture isolated from the mother liquor, by chromatography. The optional step of isomer separa tion may be carried out after the cyclization or, alternatively, following the subsequent substitution. If desired, the compounds of formula I , which do not carry the substituents R¹, R², R³ and R⁵ or are only partially substituted may be substituted by the substituents R¹ and or R² or R³ and or R⁵ also subsequent to the ring closure. In this case the base of formula I , in which R¹ and or R² or R³ and or R⁵ is hydrogen, or an acid addition salt thereof with an acid indifferent with respect to the desired substitution reaction, preferably the free base is dissolved in a solvent, in which the desired substitution reaction is to be carried out, the substitution is performed and the product obtained is isolated in an appropriate manner. If desired, the substitution reaction may be repeated with another substituent. For example the ring A of the 1,2,3,4,6,7, 12,12b octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine skeleton of the compounds of formula I , in which R¹ and or R² is hydrogen, may be subjected to sub sequent halogenation and or nitration. Or, for example, in the compounds of formula I , in which R⁵ is hydrogen, the 1 carbon atom having an α position related to the electron attracting substituent R⁶ and or in the compounds of for mula I , in which R³ is hydrogen,the indole nitrogen atom may be alkylated in an additional reaction step. This subsequent substitution step may be re peated with another substituent, if desired. The subsequent bromination of ring A in the 1,12b disubstituted octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine compounds of formula I may for example be carried out with N bromo succinimide, in a trifluoroacetic acid medium. The reaction is completed in several hours. The product is prefer ably isolated by converting the trifluoroacetic acid used as a solvent into a salt in an aqueous solution. This treatment is preferably carried out by rendering the reaction mixture alkaline with a 20 aqueous sodium carbonate solution, and separating the com pound of formula I , which is present in base form, from the trifluoroacetic acid sodium salt by extraction with a water immiscible organic solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, ether, toluene, preferably chloroform. The product may then be isolated from the organic solution in an appropriate manner, for example by evaporation and crystalliza tion, or by chromatography. As a solvent for the purification by crystallization aliphatic, cyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons or mixtures thereof, preferably petroleum ether may be employed, while chromatography is preferably performed on silica gel, with petroleum ether containing 5 to 20 of diethylamine. The chlorination of the aromatic ring A is accomplished similarly to the bromination, N chlorosuccinimide being used as a chlorinating agent. But the ring A may also be chlorinated with sulfuryl chloride, or titanium IV chloride and an organic peracid, preferably The subsequent nitration of the ring A in the 1,12b disubstituted octahydroindolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I can for example be carried out with fuming nitric acid, in an acetic acid solution. Preferably, an acetic acid solution of an indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I is added to the acetic acid solution of fuming nitric acid, at a temperature between 10 C and 30 C, preferably 0 C and 10 C. Substitution takes place in about 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the starting material employed and the reaction conditions. The product of the reaction is preferably isolated by pouring the reaction mixture onto ice water, rendering the solution alkaline with ammonia or a sodium bi carbonate solution, which is then extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent, preferably chloroform. The product obtained by evaporation of the chloroform solution may be purified by crystalli zation or chromatography, and the isomers formed are separated. The subsequent alkylation of the indole nitrogen in the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine deriva tives of formula I is preferably carried out through the anion prepared in liquid ammonia with sodium amide. In liquid ammonia sodium amide is prepared by means of sodium metal, in a conven tional manner, whereupon the indolo 2,3 a quino lizine derivative to be alkylated is added to the sodium amide obtained, preferably as a solution in tetrahydrofuran. The anion formation is complete in about 2 to 3 hours, whereupon the alkylating agent, preferably alkyl halide, such as methyl iodide is added. The alkylation is terminated in about one hour. The product is preferably isolated by letting the ammonia evaporate, dissolving the residue in a water immiscible inert organic solvent, prefer ably chloroform, and evaporating the solution, after washing with water and drying. The crude product ob tained may be purified by recrystallization or chromatography. The subsequent alkylation of the 1 carbon atom of the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I is preferably carried out by the alkylation of the anion generated by means of lithium diisopropyl amide. If the indole nitrogen is un substituted, it is also alkylated in this reaction step. If this side reaction is to be avoided, the indole nitrogen should be protected by a suitable protecting group, preferably by a benzyl group. The best solution for this is to start from tryptamine derivatives of formula II , sub stituted with benzyl. The additional step of alkylation is pre ferably carried out by adding to a solution of di isopropyl amine in dry tetrahydrofuran, butyl lithium, hexamethylphosphoric triamide and the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of for mula I , at a temperature of 30 C to 70 C and subsequently adding the desired alkylating agent, e.g. ethyl iodide at 0 C. Under these con ditions the alkylation is complete in about 30 minutes. The product is isolated from the reaction mixture after adding a sodium chloride solution, in a conventional manner, e.g. by extraction, evaporation and subsequent recrystallization or purification by chromatography. The eventual protecting group attached to the indole nitrogen of the compounds of formula I , such as the benzyl group is eliminated by catalytic hydrogenation or using sodium metal in liquid ammonia. Preferably, the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I is dis solved in a lower alcohol, preferably having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. ethanol or in a cyclic ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, a palladium on charcoal catalyst is added to the solution, and the mixture is shaken with hydrogen. After splitting off the protecting group, the catalyst is eliminated in a suitable manner, for example by filtration, and the product is isolated from the solution by evapor ation. If desired, the product can be purified by recrystallization from an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon or a mixture of such solvents, preferably from petroleum ether. If desired, the racemic indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I obtained by the process according to the invention may be separated into their optical isomers. During the resolution generally an acid addition salt of an indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I with an optically active acid is separated into a mixture of diastereomers by crystallization. As an optically active acid for example tartaric acid, diacyl tartaric acid or a semidialkyl amide of the latter compound, e.g. dibenzoyl tartaric acid semidimethyl amide, malic acid, camphenic acid or the substituted derivatives of the latter compound, etc. can be used. Typical solvents include lower aliphatic alcohols, preferably having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. If both antipodes of a compound of formula I are to be prepared by resolution, from the salt resulting from the evaporation of the mother liquor ob tained after separation of one of the two isomers, the base enriched in the other antipode is liberated, and the antipode is isolated by further resolution with a resolving agent, pre ferably with the antipode of the resolving agent used in the first step. From the diastereomeric salt pair obtained, if desired, the optically active indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I may be set free. For this purpose the salt is dissolved or suspended in a mixture of water and a water immiscible organic solvent, such as an optionally halogenated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, a straight chained or cyclic ether, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, ether, toluene, preferably dichloromethane, the solution or suspension is rendered alkaline with an in organic base, such as ammonia, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, preferably sodium carbonate, and the optically active base is extracted with the water immiscible solvent employed. The pure optically active indolo 2,3 a quinolizine base of formula I is isolated from the solution e.g. by evaporation and if desired, by subsequent re crystallization. The resolution of the indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivatives of formula I may be carried out also before or after any of the additional substitution steps described hereinabove. The compounds of formula I , if desired, be converted into their acid addition salts, preferably pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by reaction with an inorganic or organic acid. Such acids include, amongst others, mineral acids such as, for example hydrohalic acids e.g. hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids , sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid organic carboxylic acids such as for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, citric acid, cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, asparaginic acid, glutamic acid methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, Salt formation can be carried out, for example, in an inert organic solvent such as a lower, preferably C The vasodilating activity of the compounds of formula I was tested on anesthesized dogs. Electromagnetic rheometers Hellige were placed on the femoral and internal carotid arteries of the animals, and the blood flows were measured in ml. min. The arterial mean pressure was measured using a Statham pressure sensor attached to a polyethylene cannula introduced into the artery. The pulse number per minute was determined from the pulsatoric component of the blood pressure by a frequency meter. All the measured parameters were continuously registered on a multichannel polygraph. The activity of each compound was tested on more animals. The individual data obtained were averaged. In the following tables the number of animals n , the mean value of the measured para meters and the age changes are indicated. In the case of intravenous i.v. administration the starting basic values and the maximum change were registered. In the tests particularly the compound prepared according to Example 1 showed an out standing biological activity. The results obtained are set forth in Table 1 below. The results show that the test compound substantially increases the blood flow in the femoral artery 128 . In other blood vessels, for example in the cerebral region internal carotid this effect is absent. The increase in the blood flow is accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in blood pressure, which results in a very high almost 70 reduction of the vascular resistance, i.e. in a vasodilation in the femoral region. Vascular resistance mean arterial pressure blood flow . The reduction of the vascular resistance is only 13 in the carotis region, which shows that the compound has a very specific peripheral vasodilating activity. For comparison the activity of pentoxy fylline, a peripheral vasodilator, widely used in therapy, was tested. The results are shown in Table 2. From the data set forth in Tables 1 and 2 it can be concluded that the vasodilating activity of the compounds according to the invention, in particular of the compound prepared according to Example 1, is about two orders of magnitude higher than that of pentoxyfylline determined under the same conditions. Accordingly, the compounds of formula I can be advantageously used in therapy, par ticularly for the treatment of vasoconstriction. In the case of parenteral administration their expected dose is 0.1 to 1.0 mg. kg. of body weight, while in oral administration 1 to 10 mg. kg. of body weight. The new compounds of formula I and their physiologically acceptable acid addition salts may be formulated for therapeutic purposes. Thus, according to a further aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises as active ingredient at least one racemic or optically active 1,12b disubstituted octahydro indolo 2,3 a quinolizine derivative of formula I , wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are as hereinbefore defined, cis and or trans isomers or physiologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, in associ ation with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and or excipient. Carriers conventional for this purpose and suitable for parenteral or enteral administration as well as other additives may be used. As carriers solid or liquid compounds, for example water, gelatine, lactose, starch, pectine, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, olive oil, etc. can be used. The compounds can be formulated as conven tional pharmaceutical formulations, for example in a solid globular and angular pills, dragées, capsules, e.g. hard gelatine capsules or liquid e.g. oily or aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, soft gelatine capsules, inject able oily or aqueous solutions or suspensions, etc. form. The quantity of the solid carrier may be varied within wide ranges, but preferably is between 25 mg. and 1 g. The compositions optionally contain also conventional pharmaceutical additives, such as preserving agents, stabilizators, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting the osmotic pressure, buffers, flavouring and aroma substances, etc. The compositions according to the inven tion optionally contain the compounds of formula I in association with other known active ingredients. The unit doses are selected depending on the route of administration. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques including sieving, mixing, granulation, pressing or dis solution of the ingredients. The formulations ob tained may then be subjected to additional conven tional treatments, such as sterilization.
