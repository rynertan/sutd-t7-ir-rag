# INK JET ARRAY

## Abstract
An ink jet array comprises a plurality of elongate transducers 204 coupled to a plurality of ink jet chambers 200 . The transducers 204 are supported at longitudinal extremities only so as to minimise cross talk between jets within the array. The support at the extremity remote from the chamber 200 is provided by a compliant clamp 230 such that no substantial reaction force transverse to the axis of elongation of the transducers 204 occurs. The support at the other extremity includes bearings 224 precluding substantially lateral movement transverse to the axis of elongation but permitting longitudinal movement along the axis of elongation.
