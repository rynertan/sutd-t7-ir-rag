## Description
The present invention relates to cavity backed antennas and to closed packed arrays of such antennas. The invention relates particularly to cavity backed spiral antennas and especially to close packed divergent arrays of such antennas when mounted near the forward tip of a pointed radome and incorporated in an amplitude comparison monopulse radar system. Cavity backed spiral antennas operating over large radio frequency bandwidths are currently available with cylindrical cavities which are filled with radar absorbent material RAM and terminated by a balun box, and are used in monopulse radar systems. In an amplitude comparison configuration, in which the antenna axes diverge from the boresight, the diameter of the array is defined by the lowest frequency to be detected since this frequency determines the maximum spiral diameter required, by the size of the cavity, which must be sufficient to provide absorption of substantially all of the reverse radiated emission from the spiral, and by the size of the balun box. For reasons which are explained below, it is desirable to minimise this diameter so that the array can be mounted as close as possible to the forward pit of a pointed radome, at the nose of a missile for example. However for a given bandwidth the diameter of the array is largely determined by the size, i.e. the depth, of each cavity. There is little scope for reducing the cavity depth because of the requirement to absorb the reverse radiated emission from the spiral antenna which would otherwise interfere with the forward beam . Thus it has not been possible, hitherto, to mount arrays of cavity backed antennas close to the forward tip of a streamlined radome housing, and consequently a serious problem arises. Since the radiating faces of the cavity backed antennas face the inner surface of the surrounding radome and are typically separated from this surface by only a few millimetres, the respective divergent axes of the antennas are necessarily substantially normal to the radome surface. Consequently the antenna axes diverge from the boresight by an angle of typically 70 , so that the forward view performance of typically 70 , so that the forward view performance of the array is poor because target return signals from the boresight direction are badly distorted by virtue of their large angle of incidence at the antennas. It is not practicable to reduce the divergence of the antenna axes by making the radome nose blunter, because the aerodynamic performance of the radome is then reduced and results in significant extra drag. It is an object of the present invention to provide an array of cavity backed antennas according to claim 1, in which the mutual divergence between the antenna axes is reduced. According to the present invention, in a close packed divergent array of cavity backed antennas, each antenna cavity is tapered from the radiating face of the antenna towards the base of the cavity, the antennas being mounted with their cavity bases closely adjacent. The arrangement may be such that their radiating faces substantially conform to a streamlined surface. Thus the array can be closely housed within a pointed streamlined radome near the forward tip thereof. The radome may be located at the nose of a missile, for example. One embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is a sketch perspective view, partially cut away, showing a cavity backed spiral antenna suitable for use in an array according to the present invention Figure 2 is a plan view of a missile nose incorporating a monopulse radar array of the antennas of Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a front elevation taken in the direction III on Figure 2, with the forward tip of the radome cut away to reveal the antenna array. Referring to Figure 1, the antenna unit shown comprises a frusto conical metal housing 7 the cavity of which is filled with radar absorbent material RAM 8 and incorporates a spiral radiator 9 approximately 50mm in diameter at its major face. A space of a few millimetres between the RAM filling 8 and the spiral radiator 9 prevents the material from absorbing all the energy of radiation, including that which would be radiated forwards. The housing 7 also contains a lining 8 of other radar absorbent material. Spiral radiator 9 is of conventional type and consists of a disc of dielectric material on the outer surface of which two metallic tracks in the form of interleaved Archimedean spirals are printed. These tracks which are not shown in detail are connected to respective connection points 14 and 15. Monopulse radar signals are conducted between connection points 14 and 15 and connector 10 via a balun 12, which is connected to connection points 14 and 15 via a feed screen post 13 and to connector 10 via a coaxial cable 11. Figures 2 and 3 show four antennas 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the type shown in Figure 1 mounted on a square pyramidal support 2 in a close packed divergent array. The array is housed within a streamlined radome nose 1 of a missile, near the tip of the nose. Because the bases of the antennas 3, 4, 5 and 6 are much smaller than the outwardly facing spiral radiator surfaces, the antennas can be mounted close together and their spiral radiator surfaces therefore conform to the streamlined surface of radome 1. Consequently, undesirable diffraction effects, which tend to arise when the radome surface is not perpendicular to the radiative axis indicated at A , are much reduced. This advantage is achieved without compromising the forward view performance of the array since the angle between the boresight B and the radiative axis A is quite small, i.e. considerably less than 70 .
