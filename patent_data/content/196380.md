# Prostaglandin analogues, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to novel isomers of PGAs, PGDs, PGEs, PGFs, 6 keto PGE₁s, 6 keto PGF₁s, PGI₂s, 6,9α nitrilo PGI₁s and 6,α methano PGI₂s, having a specific steric configuration, which are replaced by an alkyl C₁ to C₈ substituted cycloalkyl C₄ to C₇ group in 1S, S form, in 1S, R form or in cis form at the 15 , 16 or 17 position of the PG skeleton, and, alkyl esters thereof, non toxic salts thereof, non toxic acid addition salts thereof and cyclodextrin clat hrates thereof, possessing more potent PG like pharmacolo gical activity than other isomers.
