# Method for the epitaxial deposition of several layers and devices, in particular a semiconductor laser device made by this method.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a device comprising a monocrystalline substrate and several epitaxial layers deposited on the substrate, the substrate 1 being successively contacted with solutions 11, 12, 13, 14 which are previously brought to the saturated state by contact with an auxiliary substrate 15, 16 and the substrate 1 with the solutions 11, 12, 13, 14 and the auxiliary substrate 15, 16 is cooled and the layers are successively deposited, characterized in that the epitaxial deposition comprises four phases of which in the first phase of the epitaxial process a first solution 11 is contacted with a first auxiliary substrate 16 , in the second phase the first solution 11 is contacted with a second auxiliary substrate 15 and simultaneously a second solution 12 is contacted with the first auxiliary substrate 16 , in the third phase the first solution 11 is contacted with the substrate 1 and simultaneously the second solution 12 is contacted with the second auxiliary substrate 15 , and in the fourth phase the second solution 12 is contacted with the substrate 1 .
