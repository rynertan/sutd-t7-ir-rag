# Ribbon monitoring system for printers.

## Abstract
In a printer that uses a prithead 22 with multiple electrodes 56 for supplying current to a ribbon 24 , the electrode voltage levels for a plurality of non adjacent electrodes are combined to provide a resultant voltage level that is examined in threshold detector 72 to detect abnormalities. By so combining voltages, insignificant excursions in electrical characteristics as might result from minor ribbon imperfections are generally eliminated from the triggering of a shutdown response, while still retaining a rapid response for preventing further heat generation in those situations where a serious ribbon failure has occurred.
