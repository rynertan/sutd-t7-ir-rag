# Method of displaying graphic pictures by a raster display apparatus and apparatus for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
A raster display apparatus capable of displaying graphic pictures includes a processor 13 for loading character codes pointers in a character buffer 12. The pointers address a character cell generator 22 to derive the bit patterns neces sary to refresh the display 1 under control of refresh logic 19. As the picture becomes increasingly complex, requiring more and more different character cells, the character cell generator 22 fills. Space is created by combining two or more adjacent cells into a single low resolution displayed cell an op code associated with each character code pointer determines whether the cell is to be displayed at full or reduced resolution and causes refresh logic to clock bit patterns associated with low resolution cells at a slower rate. Optionally, the processor 13 changes low resolution parts of the picture to high resolution when an operator interacts with the low resolution part using a light pen 30.
