# Compact resistor assembly.

## Abstract
The resistor assembly 30 includes a plurality of resis tor sections 31 42 each in the form of resistive plates in which slots have been cut to provide a continuous resistive element of low inductance. The resistor sections are stack ed together with thin insulating sheets 54 separating adja cent resistor sections. The resistor sections are serially interconnected. Taps are provided 56 on selected resistor sections to form a plurality of serially connected resistors in which each resistor is electrically isolated from an adja cent resistor but closely thermally coupled thereto. The resistive plates are bound together by discrete bands of an insulating material 68 such as glass cloth tape. Epoxy impregnation allows the resistor assembly when connected in shunt with series connected superconductive coils to be immersed in the liquid helium of a magnet cryostat without causing excessive pressure rise during a quench event.
