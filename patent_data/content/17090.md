# Method and apparatus for sensing a line of characters, and character recognition apparatus.

## Abstract
Character recognition apparatus detects baseline of a line of characters as an aid to segmentation in a recognition processor 16 . The characters may include underlined characters, characters of different height, characters extend ing below the baseline, and characters with subscripts. A line of sensor elements of a scanner 11 makes vertical scans successively along a line of characters. The lowest character parts occurring in a narrow band or search window extend ing along the line of characters and including the baseline are determined by logic circuitry 26 to 29 , and by a search window selection circuit 31 , responsive to a coarse baseline prediction derived from character part histograms, each for a respective group of characters along the line. A histogram generator 13 develops the histograms. The search window technique excludes underlinings from baseline determina tion. Averaging circuits 32 determine baseline from the determined lowest character parts. Excessive coarse base line skew prediction is recognised by the processor 16 and operation of the apparatus is halted to allow document repositioning.
