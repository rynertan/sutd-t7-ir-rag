# An impedance element.

## Abstract
An impedance element 1 having a longitudinal current path surrounded by ferromagnetic material is implemented by the combination of a single rectangular ferrite chip 2 , some through holes 3 provided through said chip 2 , through hole conductors 4 plated on surface of said through holes 3 , a pair of terminal conductors 8 plated at ends of said chip 2 , a surface conductive pattern 7 deposited on front and back surfaces of said ferrite chip 2 so that said through hole conductors 4 are connected in series to one another between said terminal conductors 8 , and insulation layers 16 covering said surface conductors 7 and said through hole conductors 4 on both front and back surfaces of said ferrite chip 2 . The present impedance element 1 is small in size with relatively large impedance, and is applicable for instance to a high frequency noise filter.
