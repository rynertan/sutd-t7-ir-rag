# A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR STEREOTAXIC PLACEMENT OF PROBES IN THE BODY UTILIZING CT SCANNER LOCALIZATION

## Abstract
The method and apparatus are presented which allow for CT guided biopsies of the body. The method is based on the finding of a reference point on the patient s body that exactly correlates to a point on the CT scan. This is accomplished by means of a localization device placed on the patient s skin which can be identified in cross section on the CT scan. Measurements of the localization device on CT scan can then be correlated to the device on the patient.
