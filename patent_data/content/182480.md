## Description
AUTOMOTIVE SUSPENSION CONTROL ARM This invention relates to an automotive suspension control arm. Automotive suspension systems have been constructed with a multiplicity of control arm designs.This invention relates to control arms for use in independent suspension systems. Such systems have taken a variety of forms including single arm designs such as the MacPherson design, whereas other systems commonly use two control arms. An example of the latter design is the short long arm system of the type disclosed in a copending European Patent Appln. No. based onUS Serial No. 671,644 . In the short long arm suspension system, the short arm is pivotally attached to an upper portion of the wheel carrier and the longer lower transverse arm is attached to a lower portion of the wheel carrier. Both arms are pivotally attached to the body or chassis at their inboard ends. This general arrangement of control arms has been employed with a variety of arm constructions. Stamped, forged, and formed wire constructions have been used. U.S.Patents 2,321,823, 2,845,279 and 2,886,341 disclose stamped control arms. U.S. Patents 2,083,627, 2,544,331, 2,605,118, 2,664,297, 2,674,450 and 2,996,311 disclose cast or forged constructions. Finally, U.S. patents 2,123,087, 2,717,152 and 4,170,373 disclose formed wire control arms. The present invention is suitable for forged, coined, cast or other methods of construction. In accordance with the present invention there is provided an automotive suspension control arm as herein set forth in Claim 1. The multi piece construction of the control arm provides several advantages. First, in the event that one of the three constituent elements of the arm is damaged due to wear or a collision, replacement of the damaged element is possible while at the same time retaining the remaining two elements. A second advantage offered by the multi piece control arm resides in the fact that each of the two arm members may be formed with relative ease as compared to the single piece arm disclosed, for example, in U.S.Patent 4,170,373. Because the two arm members are much smaller than would be a single element having a total size equivalent to their combined dimensions, the two smaller elements are more easily handled in such processes as forging, casing or coining. The latter process, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,170,373, can advantageously be used to form the two arm element. Yet another advantage of the multi piece control arm arises from the resilient mounting provided by the central bushing assembly which is, as previously noted, mounted in the wheel carrier. In the preferred embodiment, the central bushing assembly is of asymmetrical construction, which allows the wheel carrier to recess in the event of impacts caused by objects in the road such as tar strips, etc. This asymmetry also permits the suspension to resist brake dive . The central bushing assembly also provides a rigid connection for the arm members to each other while additionally providing a pivotable resilient connection to the wheel carrier. The asymmetric operating characteristic of the central bushing assembly is provided by elastomeric components of varying shape and composition within the bushing assembly. The invention will now be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is perspective view of an automotive suspension including a multi piece control arm, Figure 2 is a plan view of the suspension ofFigure 1. Figure 3 is a vertical section taken through the central bushing assembly and its attaching parts along line 3 3 of Figure 2. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the multi piece control arm may be utilized in a short long arm type of independent suspension. Those skilled in the art will recognize, however, that many variations in control arm design are possible using the present invention. The instant control arm comprises three major components a central bushing assembly having first and second ends for attachment to the remaining two constituent parts and first and second arm elements pivotally mounted at their inboard ends to the chassis or body and rigidly mounted at their outboard ends to the central bushing assembly. As shown in the Figures, the independent automotive suspension for attaching a road wheel to a body or chassis comprises a wheel carrier 14 having a spindle 12 upon which wheel and tire assembly 10 is rotatably mounted. Wheel carrier 14 contains a cylindrical aperture 48 at its upper end into which central bushing assembly 24 is pressed. Lower control arm 3g runs generally transversely of the body or chassis and has a bifurcated outboard end attached to the lower end of wheel carrier 14 by means of two threaded fasteners, which are inserted through the centers of two bushing assemblies contained in the outboard ends of lower arm 38. The inboard end of lower control arm 38 is pivotally attached to the body or chassis by means of bushing assembly 39.Each of these bushing assemblies, as well as the bushing assemblies mounted at the inboard pivots 17 and 19 of upper control arm 15 bears a similarity to bushing assembly 24 inasmuch as each bushing assembly comprises a central fastener running through a case hardened inner sleeve upon which is mounted a natural rubber, cylindrically shaped bushing which is in turn surrounded by an outer steel sleeve. Coil spring 40 is interposed between lower control arm 38 and the body or chassis. Shock absorber 42 is pivotally mounted at its lower end to control arm 38 and pivotally mounted to the body or chassis at its upper end. Longitudinal tension strut 44 is pivotally attached to the body or chassis at its leading end 45 and to lower control arm 38 at its trailing end. Upper control arm 15 comprises central bushing assembly 24 pressed into cylindrical bore 48 and first and second arm elements 16 and 18. Central bushing assembly 24 is oriented such that its principal axis lies generally parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the body or chassis. A first or trailing arm element 16 is pivotally mounted to the body or chassis at its first or inboard end 17 second or leading arm element 18 is identically mounted at its first or inboard end 19. Arm element 18 is rigidly attached to the leading end of central bushing assembly 24 at its second or outboard end 22 and arm element 16 is rigidly attached to the trailing end of central bushing assembly 24 at its outboard end 20. As shown in Figure 3, central bushing assembly 24 comprises inner sleeve 26 which runs between and is rigidly engaged with the second, or outboard ends 20 and 22 of arm elements 16 and 18. Inner sleeve 26 may be fabricated of case hardened low carbon steel or the like. A first generally cylindrical elastomoric bushing 28 is mounted coaxially upon a first portion of inner sleeve 26. Bushing 28 terminates with frustro conical section 46 at one end. Section 46 of bushing 28 is abuttingly engaged with outboard end 20 of trailing arm element 16. A second generally annular elastomeric bushing 32 is mounted coaxially upon a second portion of inner sleeve 26. Bushing 32 is abutted by outboard end 22 of leading arm element 18 and by flange 31 which is formed as part of outer sleeve 30, which may be of drawn steel. Outer sleeve 30 is mounted coaxially about bushing 28 and is pressed into cylindrical aperture 48 which is formed in wheel carrier 14. Bolt 34 and nut 36 clamp arm elements 16 and 18 and inner sleeve 26 and the remainder of the central bushing assembly together as a rigid control arm assembly. During suspension jounce and rebound the relative rotation between wheel carrier 14 and upper control arm 15 about the longitudinal axis of central bushing assembly 24 is accommodated solely by torsional elastic shearing motion within cylindrical bushing 28.There is no metal to metal contact to cause wear of the pivoting parts. The frustro conical section 46 of cylindrical bushing 28 cushions shocks caused by recession of wheel and tire assembly 10 and wheel carrier 14. Because outer sleeve 30 is pressed into wheel carrier 14, recession of the wheel carrier, which may be more precisely described as rearward rotation of the wheel carrier in both horizontal and vertical planes, causes cylindrical bushing 28 to shear axially during recession while fr us to conical section 46 is compressed by end 20 of arm element 16. In this manner bushing 28 resiliently allows wheel recession in the event that the wheel and tire assembly strikes an obstruction in the roadway. Annular bushing 32 is utilized during brake operation. Application of the brakes will cause wheel carrier 14 to rotate forward in a vertical plane. This forward rotation is undesirable, but is controlled by annular bushing 32, which is compressed between flange 31 and end 22 of arm element 18. Bushings 28 and 32 may be formed of natural or synthetic rubber or other elastomers having a durometer value in the range of 60 65. Those skilled in the art of suspension design will appreciate that the characteristics of bushings 28 and 32 may be changed through material substitution as well as through changes in their dimensions. First arm element 16 and second arm element 18 may be fabricated by a variety of methods including but not limited to forging. coining, casting, flame cutting and other methods. A preferred method involves a coining process of the type generally disclosed in U.S. patent 4,170,373. In this case, individual arm elements will be formed from wire which is cold worked beginning with upsetting of the ends and coining to create the annular sections for attachment to the body or chassis and the central bushing assembly.
