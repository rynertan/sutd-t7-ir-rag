# Method and apparatus for reconcentrating liquid absorbent.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for reconcentrating a liquid absorbent in an absorption system which method includes the steps of heating the rich liquid absorbent in a heating zone 10 to vaporize a portion of the solute therefrom, flashing the partially reconcentrated absorbent into a flash separator 44 and separating the lean liquid absorbent from the flashed vapors in the flash separator with the lean liquid absorbent being recycled to the absorption system and with the separated vapors being cooled to condense liquids and returning the stream of condensed liquids and vapors to the heating zone.
