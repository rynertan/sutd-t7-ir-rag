# Low temperature bonding of refractory aggregates and refractory products of improved cold strength.

## Abstract
Satisfactory bonding of refractory aggregate is ob tained by providing the aggregate with at least 5.0 by weight of free CaO of minus 200 mesh Tyler Standard Sieve particle size, adding a small amount of a lithium compound to the aggregate and heating to a temperature of about 450 C. The modulus of rupture at room temperature of a brick made from dead burnt dolomite aggregate con taining a fine fraction providing the finely divided CaO and the lithium compound additive and fired to 450 C is well above 400 psi and may be substantially equivalent to that of a brick made of the same aggregate without the lithium compound additive and fired to 1200 C. The invention com prises the method of increasing the low temperature bond ing strength of refractory aggregates, the unfired mixtures of the refractory aggregate containing the requisite CaO and the lithium compound with or without temporary liquid or solid binding agents, and the fired products made there from.
