# Ribbon type transducer with a multi layer diaphragm.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a ribbon type electro acoustic transducer comprising a magnet system having a pole plate 2, 3 and a centre pole 1 between which at least one air gap 8 is formed and a diaphragm 7 arranged in the air gap 8 . The diaphragm comprises at least two foils 10, 11 which extend substantially parallel to each other in the diaphragm plane, every two adjacent foils being joined to each other at their circumference in an air tight manner so that a volume 12 is enclosed. A conductor 9, 18 is arranged on each of the foils. Preferably the volume enclosed between two foils contains a damping material 22 .
