## Description
METHOD OF TREATMENT OF THE MYOCARDIUM AND CATHETER FOR RETROINFUSION OF PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONI. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to the use of catheters in the medical and veterinary arts and specifically to an inflatable balloon catheter for directed fluid retroinfusion, including a system of controlled retrograde administration of pharmacologic or contrast agents into the myocardium for their absorption so that they can be effectively utilized in the diagnosis or treatment of obstructive coronary artery disease.II. Reference to the Prior Art Cardiac retroperfusion consists of the delivery of oxygenated blood to jeopardized ischemic myocardium through a coronary venous vessel in a direction opposite to the normal flow of blood through that vessel and into the myocardial microcirculation when the normal arterial coronary channel through a myocardial region is obstructed. The concept of retroperfusion of the coronary veins as a surgical treatment for patients with coronary artery disease was introduced in the 1940 s. Beck, C.S. Revascularization of the Heart, Surgery, Vol. 26, p.82 1949. The two step Beck procedure consisted of creating a surgical shunt from the aorta arterial blood to the coronary sinus venous circulation , and subsequently restricting the coronary sinus to facilitate retroperfusion of coronary veins with arterialized blood. However, long term followup of these experiments demonstrated an unacceptable degree of myocardial and vascular damage. The unsatisfactory results reported in these followup studies were apparently due to the development of significant edema which caused damage to the coronary veins and myocardial tissue.This presumably resulted because of the chronic blockage of the coronary venous drainage causing a coronary venous pressure buildup which led to serious swelling of the heart tissue. Beck,C.S., et al. Operations for Coronary Disease, JAMAVol. 13, pp. 1226 33 1954. As a result of the considerable drawbacks and difficulties encountered, coupled with interest in forms of surgical revascularization of coronary arteries as a means for treating coronary artery disease, research in coronary sinus retroperfusion diminished. The concept of retroperfusion remains of limited interest in relation to management of patients exhibiting diffuse arteriosclerosis and poor distal coronary artery runoff, in which cases coronary bypass surgery is often not practicable. In the 196015 research involving surgical retroperfusion was directed at development of a more regional coronary venous treatment for curtailing potential myocardial damage. In the early 1970 s, research interest in retroperfusion turned toward a possible clinical method of treatment of the myocardium or preoperative and intraoperative support of heart function and viability in patients with coronary artery disease where other pharmacologic or standard circulatory assist interventions proved ineffective. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the present invention is to provide a coronary sinus catheter which permits directional coronary venous retroinfusion of fluids, such as pharmacologic substances, namely, thrombolytic agents, antiarrhythmic and antiinflammatory drugs, and diagnostic contrast material into the regionally diseased myocardium, applied for limited periods of time consistent with safe temporary interruption of coronary venous drainage, yet allowing adequate time for effective absorption and specific pharmaceutic performance of the administered agent.Another objective is to provide a coronary venous retroinfusion catheter with an improved anatomicallyconforming inflated balloon configuration and material which will provide a unique shape designed for a more efficient seal against the walls of the coronary sinus without obstructing essential branches of the coronary veins which might tend to cause excessive pressure buildup in the coronary venous system. Other objects of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon review of the more detailed description below. The catheter according to this invention comprises a flexible hollow fluid delivery tube for passage therethrough of retroinfusate. The retroinfusate consists of various agents used in the treatment and diagnosis of the myocardium 1 antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine, procainamide, verapamil, propranolol, disopyramide and amiodarone 2 coronary antispasmolytic drugs such as cardiazem, nifedipine, verapamil, dipyridamole, novocaine, and aminophyllin 3 other cardioactive drugs including inotropes such as digitalis, catecholamines and mannitol 4 thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activators 5 antiinflammatory agents such as prostaglandins, steroids and glucose insulin potassium mixtures and 6 various diagnostic contrast agents employed for angiography, radionuclide imaging or noniodinated echocardiographic imaging. The proximal end of the hollow catheter tube is provided with a connecting means adapted for coupling thereto of distal pressure sensor adaptors, proximal syringes or other suitable types of perfusion or injection devices. The distal end of the hollow catheter fluid delivery tube is soft and rounded to prevent damage to the vessel valves and walls as it is winded through the branch or vessel to its ultimate destination in the coronary sinus. Just 1 4 cm proximal to the distal end of said hollow catheter tube is non detachably affixed an inflatable balloon material structurally adapted to form an efficient seal against the walls of the coronary sinus when the catheter is inserted therethrough. The catheter body further comprises a second hollow tube. In one embodiment said hollow tube can be used as a means for inflation of said balloon material. The distal extension of the inflating tube is located inside the cavity formed by the non detachably secured balloon material just proximal to the distal end of the hollow delivery tube. In this embodiment the catheter body further comprises a third small lumen tube which is operatively connected to a pressure sensing device to provide pressure measurements in the coronary sinus. In another embodiment the distal extension of the hollow fluid delivery tube contains orifices located within the cavity formed by the non detachably secured balloon material to allow for direct auto inflation of the balloon material by the retroperfusate as the fluid is delivered through the tube and into the coronary sinus. In this embodiment the second hollow tube serves as a channel operatively connected to a pressure sensing means for constant monitoring of coronary venous pressures. Upon insertion of the retroperfusion catheter through the coronary sinus orifice so that the balloon material can be deployed within the coronary sinus, the balloon is inflated for predetermined safe and effective periods allowing for retroinfusion and subsequent absorption of the retroinfusate by the distal myocardium. The balloon is subsequently deflated in order to allow appropriate periods of physiologic coronary venous drainage. The inflated balloon is an acorn configuration with a broadened base and a narrow tapered apex which provides an anatomically conforming obstruction against the walls of the coronary sinus vein interfacing the coronary sinus orifice thereby insuring essentially unidirectional retrograde infusion into the coronary sinus allowing for absorption by the ischemic region. The catheter apparatus according to this invention provides a coronary venous pressure feedback means controlled by electrocardiographic synchronized intermittent coronary venous occlusion with alternating periods of coronary venous drainage. By way of example, after a period of retrograde retro instillation and subsequent absorption and runoff behind the entrapped balloon, lasting from two seconds to ten minutes, this fluid entrapment will terminate promptly if the pressure in the monitored coronary vein suddenly rises above a set limit when the balloon is immediately rapidly deflated. The pressure feedback mechanism thereby facilitates the restoration of normal coronary venous drainage via the restoration of normal coronary venous drainage via the coronary sinus into the right atrium.As a result of the specially tapered configuration of the inflated balloon material, the middle cardiac vein is not obstructed despite its positioning just inside the orifice of the coronary sinus. The tapered apex of the inflated balloon thereby allows the middle cardiac vein to communicate with other coronary veins and prevent excessive regional coronary venous pressure buildup during retroinfusion. The uniquely shaped balloon catheter inserted into the appropriate coronary vein will then provide retroperfusion permitting as much absorption of specifically infused pharmacologic agents as possible during balloon inflation, while balloon deflation after the retroinfusion i8 designed to avoid complications of myocardial edema, which hampered successful clinical application of retroperfusion procedures developed in the 1950 8. Delivery of the pharmacologic agent into the retroperfusate can be accomplished by a gravity feeding device which delivers a predetermined quantity of a specified agent per unit of time into the hollow fluid delivery tube. The pharmacologic agent may also be introduced into the catheter system by way of a retroinfusion pump which delivers a controlled and predetermined quantity of retroinfusate into the fluid delivery tube. The pump output is controlled by a feedback means which is operatively connected to a pressure measuring means which constantly monitors the pressure in the coronary sinus. When the pressure in the coronary sinus exceeds safe parameters, the pressure measuring means triggers the feedback control which in turn terminates the flow of fluid from the retroinfusate pump.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIG. 1, the fluid delivery tube 11 of the catheter has at its proximal end standard connecting means adapted for coupling thereto of syringes or other suitable types of infusion devices. The hollow fluid delivery tube provides a channel for conveyance of retroperfusate oxygenated arterial blood or retroinfusate diagnostic or pharmacologic agents for treatment of the myocardium to the diagnostic or pathologic site in the myocardium. In order to gain access to the myocardium, the catheter must be inserted through a peripheral vessel e.g., the jugular vein in the neck and winded through that branch which leads to the right atrium and then inserted through the coronary sinus orifice into the coronary sinus communicating with the target area in the myocardium. As a result of the delicate nature of the tissues in the vessels through which the catheter must pass, the catheter material must be flexible so as not to damage the valves or vessel walls of the branch into which it is inserted. It is particularly important that the distal extension of said hollow fluid delivery tube be soft and pliable since it is this portion of the tube which first comes into contact with the valves and other intimal structures of the vessel. A suitable elastomeric material provides these desirable properties and is ideal for the manufacture of the subject catheter body. The balloon material is elastic and maximally foldable to prevent tissue damage as it is winded through the vessel. Once the fluid delivery tube is in proper position for instillation of retroinfusate in the coronary sinus, the balloon material 15 shown deflated in FIG. 1 and inflated in FIG. 2 may be inflated to provide an anatomically conforming seal against the walls of the vein interfacing the coronary sinus orifice. The elastic material which comprises the inflatable balloon is non detachably secured and sealed to the catheter body at points 16 and 17. In one embodiment, the balloon is inflated by the fluid which passes through the fluid delivery tube 11. As the fluid is passed through the fluid delivery tube 11, it enters the cavity formed by the flexible balloon material 15 through small orifices 18 located in that portion of the hollow fluid delivery tube which is surrounded by the balloon material. As the fluid enters the balloon cavity, the balloon is inflated.After the balloon is inflated, the fluid flow continues through the distal extension 14 of the fluid delivery tube and out of the distal orifice 19 and into the coronary sinus.In this embodiment, the small lumen hollow tube 13 serves as a channel through which the pressure in the coronary sinus can be measured when the tube is operatively attached to a pressure transducer. In another embodiment, the small lumen hollow tube 13 provides a means for inflating the catheter balloon. In this embodiment, the hollow fluid delivery tube 11 contains no orifices in that portion of the hollow fluid delivery tube surrounded by the balloon material 15. The distal extension of the hollow inflation tube 13 is disposed within the cavity formed by the elastic balloon material which is permanently fused to secure and seal it to the catheter body. FIG. 3 shows a posterior anatomic view of the heart depicting the coronary sinus and the venous branches which empty into the right atrium and the anatomical region through which the catheter is inserted at the coronary sinus orifice. FIG. 4 shows a magnified view of the cutaway depicted in FIG. 3 showing the relative positions of the inflated balloon 15, distal extension of fluid delivery tube 14, coronary sinus 23, coronary sinus orifice 20 and middle cardiac vein 24. The balloon material when inflated by means of the hollow inflating tube 13 produces an acorn shaped balloon 15 which produces an anatomically conforming seal against the vessel wall 21 and the coronary sinus orifice 20.The narrow apex 22 of said inflated acorn shaped balloon 15 tapers away toward the center of the coronary sinus 23 thereby preventing blockage of fluid entry into the middle cardiac vein 24. The shape of the inflated balloon thereby allows the middle cardiac vein to act as a pressure relief valve when the pressure within the coronary sinus increases, thereby preventing excessive pressure buildup and consequent edema. FIG. 5 shows the auto inflatable embodiment of the subject retroinfusion catheter in its inflated configuration just inside the coronary sinus orifice. Fluid delivery is facilitated by a gravity feeding infusion container 30 which dispenses a predetermined quantity of pharmacologic agent into the hollow fluid delivery tube 11. The quantity of retroinfusate delivered can be controlled by flow regulator 31 located at the base of the infusion apparatus. The balloon material 15 is inflated in the auto inflatable embodiment by pressurized fluid flow through orifices 18 located in the distal extension of the fluid delivery tube in that portion of the tube surrounded by the balloon material 15.The fluid which comprises the retroinfusate flows through the channels formed by the orifices and into the cavity formed by the balloon material as it surrounds the hollow fluid delivery tube. The balloon is inflated just inside the coronary sinus orifice 20 to form a configuration with a broadened base and a narrow tapered apex to allow for the formation of a seal against the vein interfacing the coronary sinus orifice. The tapered apex of the balloon permits fluid flow through the middle cardiac vein 24 preventing thereby excessive pressure buildup and myocardial edema. After the balloon is inflated in diastole the fluid continues to flow through the distal extension 14 of the hollow fluid delivery tube and out of the distal orifice 19 and into the coronary sinus 23 for ultimate distribution and absorption by the pathological situs of the myocardium.A second small lumen tube 32 provides a means for communication of the fluid pressure from the fluid delivery tube 11 to a pressure sensing device 35 for constant monitoring of coronary venous pressure. FIG. 6 shows the auto inflatable embodiment of the retroinfusion catheter wherein the fluid is fed through a hollow tube 36 to a synchronous gasactuated bladder pump 39 and into the hollow fluid delivery tube 11 for ultimate delivery into the coronary sinus 23. In this embodiment the small lumen tube 32 which provides a channel for communication of pressure changes in the coronary sinus is operatively attached to a pressure sensing device 35 which operatively communicates with a negative feedback means 37 which when activated by excessive pressures in the coronary sinus 23 triggers a reduction or termination of pump 39 operation providing thereby an automatic system of retroinfusate regulation. FIG. 7 shows a magnified depiction of the hollow fluid delivery tube 11 and the orifice 18 which provides channels for entry of fluid into the cavity formed by the balloon material 15 for inflation of the auto inflatable embodiment of the retroinfusion catheter. The narrow tapered apex of the balloon prevents obstruction of the middle cardiac vein allowing thereby drainage of the coronary sinus 23 when the coronary venous pressure exceeds safe parameters. When the catheter according to this invention is inserted through the coronary sinus orifice by way of a peripheral vessel, the catheter is capable of stopping the natural flow of blood in the vessel when the balloon is inflated in cardiac diastole, reversing the direction of the natural flow of blood by injecting through the hollow fluid delivery tube shunted oxygenated arterial blood in retrograde fashion through the coronary sinus making thereby a retroperfusion, providing a mechanism for release of excessive pressure in the coronary sinus by allowing for drainage of fluid when necessary through the middle cardiac vein, deflating said balloon material and allowing a resumption of the natural anterograde blood flow from the coronary sinus through the coronary sinus orifice into the right atrium. The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
