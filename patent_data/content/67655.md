# Fluidised bed combustor.

## Abstract
A method of starting up a fluidised bed combustor in which a gas containing oxygen is passed from an outlet beneath the level of the slumped bed 2 to cause a spouting action above the level of the slumped bed 2 . Liquid fuel is supplied from a nozzle 5 adjacent to or located within the spout, and an ignition source applied to the bed 2 . The liquid fuel and gas containing oxygen supply are regulated so as to fluidise at least part of the bed 2 adjacent to the liquid fuel outlet and to obtain a controlled rise in the temperature of the bed 2 until the hot fluidised condition is reached.
