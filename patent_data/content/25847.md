# Radioactive material in stable physical article form and method for preparing same.

## Abstract
Radioactive waste material, such as that resulting from radioactive weapons plant operation or from nuclear fuel reprocessing, in suitable form, such as radionuclide containing oxide and or oxyhydroxide and or hydroxide par ticles 27 , is held by a metal or metal alloy to an electrically conductive cathodic material 19 , upon which the metal or alloy is electrodeposited. In this way the radionuclide species are incorporated into a metal matrix held to a base and may be disposed of, as by underground storage, in such form, which is considered to be more resistant to dissolution by ground water and to damage by mechanical stresses arising from tectonic activity than are glasses or ceramics incorporating radionuclides. In improvements of the process and of the resulting radionuclide including article, the article is elec trolytically or otherwise covered or coated with suitably cor rosion resistant and mechanical damage resistant covering s or coating s , 14, 16, 18 as by continuing electrodeposition of the metal, sometimes after addition of more material, which is a source of the metal, to a suitable electrolyte, or after replacement of the electrolyte.
