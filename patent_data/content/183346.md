# Iron containing silicate having ZSM 5 crystalline structure, its method of preparation, and its use in hydrocarbon conversion.

## Abstract
A crystalline iron containing silicate has the X ray diffraction pattern of ZSM 5 and a crystallographic lattice containing silicon and iron, wherein at least 60 by weight of the iron contained by said silicate is in positions of tetrahedral substitution in the lattice and wherein the molar ratio of SiO2 to Fe2O3 in said crystalline iron containing silicate is at least 30.
