## Description
LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING ORGANO FUNCTIONAL POLYSILOXANES Christian BARRAT Alfred BUSCH Kosmas SARDELIS This invention relates to liquid detergent compositions containing low levels of selected organo functional polydi alkylsiloxanes. In more detail, the compositions herein comprise conventional ingredients inclusive of surface active agents, liquid carrier and optional ingredients such as detergent builders, enzymes and suds regulants and low levels of organo functional polydi short alkylsiloxanes. The latter ingredient unexpectedly provides desirable through the wash textile benefits inclusive of softness. The preferred siloxanes embrace amino derivatives. The essential siloxanes are further characterized by a degree of substitution in the range from 0.01 0.7. The through the wash textile benefits conferred by the inventive compositions, in addition to softening, are frequently perceived in terms of anti static, ease of ironing and anti wrinkling benefits. On a conservative basis, it was established that, at least, and contrary to standing prejudice, the essential siloxane components do not, adversely affect the general textile cleaning suitability of the compositions herein.The liquid compositions herein can be divided arbitrarily in mostlyP built compositions and in substantially unbuilt compositions.Both kinds of compositions will procure textile handling benefits. Selective preference can originate from the combined use of anionic surface active agents in combination with the subject siloxanes. The prior art relative to the textile treatment utilization broadly of silicones polydialkylsiloxanes is crowded and diverse.The like siloxanes have, for example, found widespread commercial application in a detergent suds regulant functionality. Silicone polymers have also found widespread application in the textile industry to provide fiber properties inclusive of softness, water proofing and easy ironing. To that effect the silicone polymers are applied in the textile industry to the fabrics during manufacture or during make up of clothing, in the form of relatively concentrated dispersions or solutions either by padding or spray on.Often, especially for long lasting softness, water proofing treatment or other benefits, mixtures or organofunctional polydialkylsiloxanes are used. The fabrics are subsequently treated with catalysts or heated to cause crosslinking or setting of the silicone polymers. German Patent 27 54 504 and U.S. 4.247.592 disclose a treating agent consisting of a polydimethylsiloxane containing diaminoalkyl groups for providing softness to natural and synthetic fabrics. Japanese Patent 79,131,096 pertains to a treating agent consisting of a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane with NHR groups and a polydimethylsiloxane with hydroxy end groups, for providing softness to acrylics. The fabrics are spray coated and then heated for curing. German Patent 20 16 095 uses polydimethylsiloxane containing pendant epoxy groups for providing softness and smoothness to synthetic organic fabrics. European Patent 058 493 relates to a treating agent mixture of an organo polysiloxane containing diaminoalkyl and polyoxyalkylene groups, with an organopolysiloxane containing carboxylic acid ester groups or with an organopolysiloxane containing epoxy and polyoxyalkylene groups. The mixture is added by spray on and treated for curing. It is said to provide softness, anti wrinkling and long lasting electrostatic prevention benefits. German Patent application DOS 26.31.419 relates to fabric rinse softening compositions containing a fabric substantive cationic component and a polydimethylsiloxane possibly amino substituted. The mixture is applied as an aqueous dispersion. The suds regulant utilization of polydimethylsiloxanes in liquid detergent is known from European Patent application 0.028.865. U.S. Patent 4.075.118 discloses the utilization of emulsified polydimethylsilicones for suds regulant purposes. The feasibility for using polydimethylsilicones in granular detergents for foam control is known from DOS 23.38.468. It is also known that the detergent incorporation of polydimethylsiloxane suds regulants can adversely affect textile cleaning benefits. It has now been found that specific organo functional polydialkylsiloxanes, preferably aminosubstituted species, can advantageously be incorporated in liquid detergents generally to provide remarkable benefits inclusive of through the wash softening and further textile handling improvements. The essential means needed to achieve these unexpected properties are explained in more detail hereafter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is based on the discovery that liquid detergent compositions capable of simultaneously providing fiber cleaning and textile handling benefits, inclusive of softness, can now be formulated containing a binary component systems and an organo functional siloxane. In particular, the compositions herein comprise a from 5 to 70 by weight of a surface active agent selected from the group of anionic, nonionic, ampholytic and zwitterionic surface active agents and mixtures thereof b a liquid carrier and c if desired, conventional detergent additives inclusive of detergent builders, enzymes and suds regulants, characterized in, that it contains d from 0.05Z to 5 by weight of an organo functional poly di Cl 4 alkyl siloxane textile treatment agent having the general formulaEMI4.1 EMI4.2 tb wherein SEP R SEP SEP C SEP 14 alkyl tb Z SEP is SEP N tb SEP x SEP Y tb n is an integer from 1 to 6 whereby X and Y are, selected independently, H C1 3o alkyl C6 aryl C5 6 cycloalkyl C1 6 NH2 CO R with the proviso that the nitrogen can be quaternized such as to representEMI4.3 whereby W can be selected from X or Y EMI5.1 whereby P and M are COOH CO NR 2 or CO OR and wherein R is hydrogen or Cl 2 alkyl with the further proviso that the degree of substitution, i.e., the molar proportion of silicones carrying a substituent other than a C1 14 alkyl group to total silicones is in the range from 0.01 to 0.7. Especially preferred are aminosubstituted siloxanes having a degree of substitution in the range from 0.05 to 0.5. In one preferred execution herein the substituted siloxanes are incorporated in liquid detergent compositions containing inorganic builder salts such as poly phosphates. In another preferred composition aspect of the invention, the siloxanes are incorporated in concentrated liquid compositions which are substantially free of builders. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention herein broadly relates to liquid detergent compositions comprising a surface active agent, a liquid carrier, an organo functional polydi alkylsiloxane textile treatment agent, and, if desirable, conventioual detergent additives. These variables and other aspects of the invention are explained in more detail hereinafter. Unless indicated to the contrary, the percent indications stand for percent by weight . THE SURFACE ACTIVE AGENT A first essential component for use in the compositions of this invention is represented by a surface active agent selected from the group of anionic, nonionic, amphoteric ampholytic and zwitterionic surface active agents and mixtures thereof. In the context of this invention, the term nonionic surface active agent is meant to include semi polar nonionic surfactants. Examples of suitable non ionic surfactants are disclosed inE.P.A 0.028.865 page 4, line 23 to page 5, line 10 and page 8 line 14 to page 9, line 4, said disclosures being incorporated herein by reference. A disclosure of zwitterionic and ampholytic surfactants for use herein can also be found in E.P.A 0.028.865 page 7, line 21 to page 8, line 13, this passage being also incorporated herein by reference. The anionic surfactants for use herein can be represented by known synthetic and natural anionic surface active agents which are known to be suitable for use in detergents and frequently have found commercial application. Suitable synthetic anionic surfactants are described in E.P.A 0.028.865 page 5, line 12 to line 31. Examples of natural anionic surface active agents for use in this invention can be represented by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having from 10 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain or the alkali metal, earth alkali metal and amine or alkanolamine soaps thereof.Preferred fatty acids soaps have from 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Well known examples of fatty acids soaps suitable for use herein are natural coconut fatty acid containing a majority ofC12 and C14 acids and tallow fatty acids containing a mixture of saturated and unsaturated C16 and C18 fatty acids soaps. The surface active agent is used generally at levels from 5 to 70 . While the surface active agent may be varied over the broad range depending upon the intended utility of the composition and the quantitative and qualitative definition of the additional ingredients and possibly optional components, two preferred executions can be formulated depending upon the presence of poly phosphate builders. In a first preferred execution of the invention liquid compositions are envisaged which are substantially unbuilt. In this embodiment, the surface active agents are frequently used in an amount from 25 to 55 and are represented by a mixture of anionic and nonionic surface active agents, more preferably in a weight ratio of anionic to nonionic in the range from 4 1 to 1 4. In a second preferred embodiment, liquid built detergent compositions are contemplated containing from 5 to 25 , preferably from 5 to 15 surface active agent. the latter ingredient can preferably be represented by a mixture of anionic and nonionic surface active agents whereby the anionic species represents at least 20X of the sum of anionic and nonionic surface active agents, and at least 3 , calculated on the detergent composition. The like detergent compositions frequently comprise from 5t to 30 , preferably from 12 to 25 of a detergent builder which can be represented by conventional detergent builders many of which have already found commercial application Well known examples of suitable builders include the alkali, often sodium, metal salts of poly phosphates, e.g. tripolyphosphoric acid, nitrilotriacetic acid NTA , citric acid and crystalline, completely hydrated, synthetically prepared zeolite builders having a particle diameter in the range from 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.1 to 4 micrometers.Suitable zeolite builders are ZEOLITE As X and P. Mixtures of detergent builders can also be used. The compositions herein can additionally contain, as an optional ingredient, a cationic surfactant. Suitable cationic surfactant species for use herein are described in European Patent application 0.028.865, page 5, line 32 to page 7 line 21, this passage being incorporated herein by reference. The cationic surfactants can provide and or enhance a broad range of textile treatment benefits inclusive of cleaning, feel, and bactericidal advantages. These optional cationic surface active agents are used in additive levels, such as in levels not exceeding 10 of the cumulative amount of anionic and nonionic surfactants defined hereinbefore, and more preferred in a range from 1 to 5 of the detergent composition. THE LIQUID CARRIER The compositions herein contain as a further essential component a liquid carrier, possibly a mixture of liquid carriers.The liquid carrier component can be represented by water and conventional liquid organic carriers. Non limiting examples of the like organic carriers include lower aliphatic alcohol having from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 3 hydroxyl groups ethers of diethylene glycol and lower aliphatic mono alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof. Specific examples of liquid carriers are ethanol n propanol isopropanol butanol 1,2 propanediol 1,3 propanediol n hexanol monomethyl , ethyl , propyl, and mono butyl ethers and di ethylene glycol. Other organic solvents having a relatively high boiling point and low vapor pressure can also be used, provided they do not react with any of the other ingredients present.The relative quantities of liquid carriers needed to insure the liquid state of the composition can vary depending upon the qualitative and quantitative ingredient parameters in a given composition. However, the adequate choice of the carrier is based on routine determinations well known in the art. THE ORGANO FUNCTIONAL SILOXANE The essential organo functional siloxane for use herein can be present in levels from 0.05 to 5 , preferably from 0.1 3 , and most preferably from 0.15 1x. Using levels below 0.05 will not anymore produce, to any noticeable extent, the claimed benefits whereas the incorporation of levels exceeding 5 will not produce additional benefits commensurate with proportional to the level increase. The organo functional polydi C1 4 alkyl siloxane component can stoichiometrically be defined with the aid of the following formula EMI9.1 EMI9.2 wherein R C1 4 alkyl n is an integer from 1 to 6 whereby X and Y are, selected independently, H C1 30 alkyl C6 aryl C5 6 cycloalkyl C1 6 NH2 CO R with the proviso tha the nitrogen can be quaternized such as toEMI9.3 tb I SEP N W, tb SEP X SEP Y tb whereby W can be selected from X and YEMI9.4 whereby P and M are COOH CO NR 2 or CO OR and wherein R is hydrogen or C1 2 alkyl with the proviso that the degree of substitution, i.e. the molar proportion of silicones carrying a substituent other than aC1 4 alkyl group to total silicones is in the range from 0.01 to 0.7, preferably from 0.02 0.3. The siloxane component is preferably represented by amino functional polydialkylsiloxanes which are frequently used in levels from 0.1 to 3Z, more preferably from 0.15 1.0 . The degree of substitution of preferred siloxanes, such as the aminosiloxanes, can be expressed as the molar moiety proportion of non terminal silicones carrying a substituent other than a C14 alkyl group to total non terminal silicones. The numerical value for the degree of substitution of preferred siloxanes lies in the range from 0.01 to 0.7 preferably from 0.02 to 0.3. While non terminal substitution is preferred for enhanced through the wash fiber substantivity, it is understood that siloxanes with substituted terminal silicone atoms can also be used. In the preferred siloxane component herein, n is 3 or 4, X andY are, selected independently, hydrogen C14 a1kyI C5 6 cycloalkyl and C2 NH2. Preferred organofunctional polydimethyl siloxanes include aminofunctional siloxanes, such as Abbreviated N cyclohexylamino 4 amino butyl l polydimethylsiloxane Sil I Ethylene diamino N butyl l polydimethylsiloxane Sil Il N dodecyl 4 amino butyl l polydimethylsiloxane Sil III 4 N, N dimethyl ammonium butyl l polydimethylsiloxane Sil IV 5 tallow amide 4 carboxy pentyl l polydimethyls iloxane Sil V The organofunctional siloxanes have generally a viscosity in the range from 40 cSt to 100.000 cSt, preferably from 250 cSt to 2000 cSt. The viscosity of the siloxanes is measured on the pure raw material at 25 C with the aid of a BROOKFIELD viscometer LV Digital . The organofunctional polydimethyl siloxanes, in addition to the essential substituents defined hereinbefore, can contain polyalkylene oxide chains attached to unsubstituted silicone atoms in the meaning of this invention . The polyalkylene, such as propylene or ethylene, oxide chains are attached to the silicone atoms instead of a C14 alkyl group. The alkoxylation enhances the hydrophilic and antistatic charge reducing properties of the component in relation to the textiles. OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS In addition to the essential components, the compositions herein can contain a series of optional detergent ingredients with a view to improve the composition taking into consideration the specific utilization. These optional components can be presented by virtually all substances, which are known to suitable for use in the like composition, for their known functionality in the art established levels.The non built or built compositions of the invention can contain, in addition to the detergent builder, other types of sequestrants, having precipitation inhibitor or anti incrustation properties, in varying levels e.g. in an amount from 0.2X to 5 . Such further sequestrants can be water soluble copolymeric ingredients e.g.polyacrylates, polymaleates and copolymeric carboxylates including those obtained from the copolymerization of unsaturated polyacids such a maleic or citraconic acid with suitable polymerizable reaction partners such as methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, mesaconic acid and methyl vinyl ether. Mixture of the like watersoluble detergent sequestrant can also be used. Examples of other optional components are detergent enzymes such as proteases, amylases, lipases and mixtures thereof, and stabilizing agents for the like enzymes., soil suspending agents such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone, suds regulants, such as C16 22 fatty acids and methylated polysiloxanes, especially dimethylpolysiloxane, said silicone being used preferably at levels from 0.01 to 0.4Z. Hydrotropes can also be used and are frequently desirable in built compositions. Examples of suitable hydrotropes include the water soluble alkylaryl sulfonates having up to 3 carbon atoms in an alkyl group such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, and ethanol amine salts of xylene , toluene , ethylbenzene and isopropyl benzene sulfonic acids.The subject compositions further can comprise brighteners, perfumes, dyes, bactericidal agents, antioxidants, opacifiers, photoactivators, fillers and the like.
