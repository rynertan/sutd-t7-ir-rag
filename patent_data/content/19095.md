# Regulated voltage current supply circuits.

## Abstract
Circuitry for generating a regulated supply voltage at output 24 comprises a primary source 12 of the voltage to be regulated which is supplied to one input of differential amplifier 10 providing complementary outputs. The complementary outputs are alternatively supplied via switch 22 to an amplifier stage 20 providing the output at 24. The regulated output is fed back to the second input of amplifier 10 via switch 26 or rectifier 30 and provides a primary regulation of the output thereof. The switches 22, 26 are ganged to give correct polarity to the fed back signal. The output from the amplifier 10 is also fed back through a feedback amplifier 40 which comprises a current mirror circuit. The signal from the amplifier 40 is used to control the current in the differential amplifier 10 and thus further to regulate the output of the amplifier 10.
