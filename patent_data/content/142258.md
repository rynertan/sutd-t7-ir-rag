# Method and apparatus for controlling latch up in CMOS circuits.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for controlling latch up in a CMOS circuit is provided. In use, a power supply transition is sensed by a sensing circuit 70 . In response thereto, a clamp ing transistor 62 of a clamping circuit 52 connects the substrate to ground. After the power supply transition, the clamping transistor 62 is switched OFF by way of a control transistor 58 and the connection of the substrate to ground is released. A charge pump 120 is thus enabled to bias the substrate to a suitable voltage VBB , for example, to 3 volts. The charge pump 120 , the clamping transistor 62 and related circuit elements are all located on the same CMOS substrate where latch up is to be controlled. The substrate to ground capacitance is increased to prevent localised subs trate voltage disturbances which could induce latch up.
