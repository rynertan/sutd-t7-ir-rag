# Preparation of vanadium phosphorus catalysts and use thereof in production of maleic anhydride.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of oxidation catalysts containing mixed oxides of vanadium and phosphorus, which catalysts are particularly effective in the oxidation of n butane, n butenes, 1,3 butadiene or a mixture thereof with molecular oxygen or an oxygen containing gas in the vapour phase to produce high yields of maleic anhydride with good selectivity comprises introducing a vanadium compound into an olefinic oxygenated or ganic liquid medium, adding a phosphorus containing compound to the medium reducing at least a portion of the vanadium to a 4 valence state either prior to or subsequent to the addition of the phosphorus contain ing compound, and recovering the resulting vanadium phosphorus oxide catalyst precursor which is then dried and calcined.
