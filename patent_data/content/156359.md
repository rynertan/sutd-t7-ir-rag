# ELECTRONIC TYPEWRITER

## Abstract
An electronic typewriter has a keyboard 2 including a plurality of character keys 8, 9 , a printing wheel 5 having a plurality of types which can be designated by the character keys 8, 9 , a ribbon position setting circuit 18 for selectively setting a printing ribbon 6 at either one of printing or rest positions, and a control circuit 12 which supplies a first control signal to the ribbon position setting circuit 18 so that the printing ribbon 6 is set at the printing position and thereafter the type designated by one of the operated char acter keys strikes a paper sheet through the printing ribbon 6 when one of the character keys 8, 9 is detected to have been operated while the printing ribbon 6 is set at the rest position, and which supplies a second control signal to the ribbon position setting circuit 18 so as to set the printing ribbon 6 at the rest position when no further key operation is detected for a preset holding time after the printing by one of the character keys is ended. The electronic typewriter fur ther has a holding time data generator 15 for generating holding time data which is used to determine the preset hold ing time and can be arbitrarily changed.
