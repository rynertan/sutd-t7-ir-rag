## Description
Apparatus for the Chemical Treatment of Crops This invention relates to apparatus for the chemical treatment of crops and the like, especially the application of a chemical weeckiller to weeds growing amongst a crop0Background For the chemical treatment of growing crops with feeds and pesticides, tractor borne spraying units are commonly employed. However, treatment for weeds can usually only be carried out before the crop starts to grow, because any subsequently sprayed on weedkiller is liable to cause crop damage. Up to the present, therefore, weeds which germinate simultaneously with or subsequent to germination of the crop have generally been left untreated, although their presence is materially disadvantageous both during crop growth and maturity and during harvesting.It is an aim of the present invention to contribute to the solution of this problem. The Invention According to the invention, there is provided apparatus for the chemical treatment of crops and the like, comprising an applncation roller, means for maintaining the application roller at a predetermined level above the ground, means for driving the application roller in rotation, and means for coating said application roller with a liquid chemical having a thickening agent added thereto substantially to prevent dripping. Generally, weeds tend to grow higher than the cro especially during the initial stages of growth. Thus, if the e level of the application roller is preset higher than the tops of the crop but below the tops of the intermingled weeds, a weedkiller can be successfully applied without crop damage, provided also that dripping of the weedkiller can also be substantially avoidedIn e present invention, dripping of weedkiller is minimiseci by adding a thickening agent, such as an anti drift agent already known for use in chemical spraying.Further features The coating means may comprise a chemical both in conjunction with an extracting roller rotating hrough the liquid surface and one or more transfer rollers rolling between said extracting ,r oller and the a action roller Preferably, however, the coating means comprises at least one distribution roller in rolling contact with the application roller, said at least one distribution roller being made hollow in order to serve as a reservoir for the thickened liquid chemical, In a preferred construction, said at least one distribution roller has an apertured reservoir surface covered with a layer of porous material, such as a layer of felt or the like in turn covered by a perforated outer layer of non porous materialConveniently, said at least one distribution roller has a filler plug, and means are provided to bring said distribution roller to rest after rotation thereof with the filler plug uppermost. The driving means may act on the distribution roller or rollers, but in the preferred arrangement the driving means acts directly on the application roller, the at least one distribution roller being rotated by rolling contact with said driven application roller. The roller assembly may be mounted on an arm also supporting the drive means, for example an arm adapted for lateral attachment to a hedge trimming vehicle or verger, However, in the preferred practical arrangement referred to, the level maintaining means comprises a boom adapted to be mounted on the front or rear of tractor, more especially a boom which is adapted to be pivotally mounted on the tractor For example, at least one wheel may be mounted on the boom to follow the contour of the ground and to pivot the boom accordingly. Said at least one wheel is preferably adjustable relative to the boom in order to enable said predetermined level o the application roller to be adjusted, for example by means of a ram powered from or hydraulics system. mLe rotational drive means for the roller assembly may conveniently comprise an electric motor, such as a variable speed D.C. series motor adapted to be connected to the tractor battery supply circuit.In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of a preferred arrangement of crop treating apparatus in accordance with the invention, mounted at the front end of a tractor Figure 2 is a cross section on the line A A of Figure e 3 is a cross section on the line B B of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a cross section on the line C C of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a diagrammatic side view of the preferred arrangement mounted on the tractor and Figure 6 shows an alternative roller assembly. In Figure 1, the reference 10 designates a tractor and the reference 11 designates a boom or transverse framework supporting the crop treating apparatus in accordance with the invention0 The rear of the boom 11 is mounted on the front arms 12 of the tractor 10 see Figure 5 , this mounting including a pivotal connection not shown enabling the boom to pivot on its mounting about a horizontal axis.The front of the boom 11 carries a pair of ground wheels 13. In use, the wheels 13 follow the contour of the ground, and the mounting of the boom 11 enables it to pivot accordingly0 The mean level at which the boom is supported above the ground is adjustable by varying the level of the wheels 13 relative to the front of the boom framework. A manual adjustme for this purpose is indicated at 14 alternatively this adjustment may be made by means of an hydraulic ram powered from the tractor hydraulics A transversely extending roller assembly is carried by the boom 11, generally on the underside thereof This assembly comprises an application roller 15 and two distributing rollers 16 seeFigures i, 3 and 5 .The roller assembly is employed, for example, to apply weedkiller to weeds growing amongst a crop and projecting above the level of the top of the crop Thus, by means which will be later described, the application roller 15, i.e the lowermost roller, is rotated while being continuously coated with a liquid chemical weedkiller. The height of the front end of the boom is set such that this rotating application roller 15 lies at a predetermined level above the ground which is above the height of the top of the crop but below the height of the tops of the weeds0 When the tractor 10 is driven through the crop, the weedkiller coating on the roller 15 is brushed on to the weeds, but the crop is untouched. The ground wheels 13 ensure that the said predetermined level of the roller 15 substantially follows the ground contours The construction of a distribution roller 16 is shown in detail in Figures 3 and 4. It comprises a hollow plastics pipe 17, for example of polTvinyl chloride, closed at its ends 18. It is provided with a countersunk lller plug 19, and two rows of holes 20 extending along its length, adjacent opposite sides of the filler plug in the circumferential direction, In a typical case, the pipe 17 may be of about 12.5 cm diameter, with the holes 20 spaced apart about 5 cm in the longitudinal direction.From Figure 1 it will be clear that each distribution roller 16 spans a half the length of the application roller 15, but it would be possible to employ a single full length distribution roller, or alternatively more than two such rollers. The apertured pipe 17 is covered with a layer 21 of felt or similar porous material0 Furthermore, as each distribution roller 16 is in rolling contact with the application roller 15 and in use is rotationally driven thereby, it may be preferred to cover the felt or like layer 21 with a thin perforated outer layer not shown of rubber or plastics material. The distribution rollers 16 serve as reservoirs for a liquid weedkiller 22 which, in use, is coated on the application roller 15. The application roller 15 is a hollow roller of plastics material such as polyvinylchloride or a metal roller, closed at its ends. The rollers 15 and 16 are shaft mounted on the boom framework 11 for rotation about their respective axes. The support shafts for the distribution rollers 16 are designated 23 in the drawings, and the support shaft for the application roller 15 is designateg 24. The latter may take the form of stub shafts at opposite ends of the application roller 15 if desired. Mounted at one end of the boom 11 is an electric motor not shown for applying a rotational drive to the application roller 15. Conveniently, this motor may take the form of a speed controllable d.c. series motor having a variable resistance in its supply lead.This supply lead is conveniently adapted for connection into the battery circuit of the tractor 10. Relatively little power is required to drive the rollers 15, 16, so that a small electric motor will usually suffice. However, if a heavy drive unit is employed, for example an hydraulic motor powered from the tractor hydraulics, it will be preferable to mount a counterweight at the remote end of the boom. In use, the distribution rollers 16 are loaded with liquid chemical weedkiller, thickened with a thickening agent for the reason later discussed, and the boom 11 is attached to the tractor 10. The mean level of the application roller 15 is set to the required predetermined level, the rotational roller assembly drive is started into operation, and the tractor 10 is driven through the crop to be treated.As the distribution rollers 16 rotate, , driven by the rotating application roller 15, weedkiller is fed into the felt layers 21 and is continuously coated on to the application roller 15, one distribution roller coating each half of the length of the application roller.The latter roller 15 brushes the weedkiller on to the weeds, and more weedkiller is drawn out of the reservoir, through the porous layers 21 of the distribution rollers 16, to maintain the coating on the application roller 15 as crop treatment proceeds. Conveniently, when the treatment is completed and the roller assembly drive is stopped, means may be provided to ensure that the distribution rollers 16 come to rest with the filler plug 19 and the rows of holes 20 uppermost. In Figure 2, the reference 25 denotes a support for maintaining the generally horizontal condition of the boom 11 when it is disconnected from the trz or It will be clear from the above description of the arrangement of the roller assembly and its method of use that a primary aim of the invention is to be able to brush a liquid chemical on to plants at a higher level without contaminating other plants at a lower level.It is therefore clearly important to avoid dripping of the liquid chemical in question,The above described arrangement is specifically designed to minimise leakage, for example by the use of sealed bearings at the ends of the distribution rollers through which their support shafts extend.In addition, however, it is necessary to minimise dripping due to surpluses of liquid chemical collecting on the surfaces of the rollers 15 and 16,For this reason, as previously mentioned, a thickening agent is added to the liquid chemical, to convert said liquid into a gel. One thickening agent which can be employed is the material known by the Trade as Polycell, but this is not wholly satisfactory as the gel tends to solidify if not used relatively quickly.More suitable agents are the anti drift agents commonly employed as additives to chemicals used for crop spraying. One such suitable agent is that known by the Trade E.ark itaflock. Finally, it will be appreciated that various further modifications of the above described invention, otber than those already mentioned, are possible within the scope of the invention. For example, Figure 6 diagrammatically illustrates an alternative arrangement for coating the application roller, which in this figure is designated 26. A static reservoir tank 27 is fixedly mounted on the boom not shown , with an extraction roller 28 rotating through the gelled liquid 29 in the tank, Transfer rollers 30 and 31 form a chain between the extraction roller 28 and the application roller 26. Clearly, the rollers 28, 30 and 31 will have suitable porous outer layers facilitating the transfer of the liquid chemical which, as previously, is applied as a coating to the application roller 26, The modified arrangement ofFigure 6 avoids the relatively complex construction of the distribution rollers 16 of the arrangement ofFigures l to 5, but is disadvantageously heavy and possibly more expensive More important, it entails a larger number of liquid covered surfaces from which the chemical can drip or be wasted through evaporation.
