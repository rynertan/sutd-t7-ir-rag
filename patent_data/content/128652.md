# Scrap tire cutting apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for cutting scrap tires and other waste pro ducts is disclosed. The apparatus includes a frame having a cylindrical anvil roll 10 rotatably mounted therein. A pair of blade rolls 5, 30 are also mounted in the frame for rotation about corresponding axes which are parallel to the rotational axis of the anvil roll, the blade rolls being angularly spaced from one another relative to the axis of the anvil roll and being positioned about the periphery of the anvil roll. The blade rolls are each provided with a plurality of blades 8,40 or predetermined diameter fixed thereto and rotatable therewith, the blades 8 of one blade roll 5 being at a low angle to the axis of that roll and the blades 40 of the other blade roll 30 being at a high angle to the axis of that roll, so that a tire passing between both blade rolls and the anvil roll will be cut into rhomboidal pieces that are nearly rectangular in shape during a single pass through the apparatus. The blade rolls are each also provided with a pair of axially spaced thrust wheels, with the thrust wheels being positioned outboard of the blades and being equal to or slightly greater in diameter than the predetermined diameter of the blades. Driving means are provid ed in the apparatus for rotating the anvil roll in one direction and the blade rolls in an opposite direction. Biasing means 60, 80 are also provided for forcing the outer peripheries of the thrust wheels and the anvil roll into hard contact with one another thereby to maintain fixed the spacing between the cutting sur faces of the blades and the outer surface of the anvil roll notwith standing the separating forces caused by the movement of a tire between such surfaces.
