# Method and apparatus for control of gas borne particulates.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus 1 for control of airborne particulates in enclosed spaces, wherein air is made to flow in parallel airstreams F , with velocities of the streams selectively graded across the work space W , so that the integrity of the air flow pattern is better preserved while encountering obstructing objects 6 that lie in its path and so that any particle introduced into a stream remains entrained and airborne over a longer distance along the clean to dirty axis X . The velocity gradient is achieved by a filtering device 1 comprising a plurality of pleats 25 each peat having a different surface area.
