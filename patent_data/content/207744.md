# Electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell system disposed in a housing 10 comprising a container 9 having an open end closed by a cover 11 sealed in the open end and including means, for venting the housing responsive to a pressure build up within the cell housing, characterised by a the housing 10 including a portion having a flared flange 16 defining a vent passageway 15 through the housing with a first opening 14 of the passageway 15 facing into the housing 10 and a second opening 20 of the passageway 15 facing to the exterior of the housing 10 , the first opening 14 being smaller than the second opening 20 and b an electrically insulating material 26 hermetically sealed within the passageway 15 .
