# Coil assembly.

## Abstract
A coil assembly 31 having a core 32 and a winding 33 on the core 32 , wherein a contact element 37, 38 electrical ly connected to the winding 33 is both mechanically clamped and bonded to the core 32 . In an exemplary microcoil assem bly 31 having a C core 32 , a generally U shaped contact el ement 37, 38 is bonded to each foot 34 of the core by epoxy and mechanically clamped to the core foot 34 to hold the con tact element in position while the epoxy cures. One end of the coil winding is soldered to one of the contact elements and the other end of the winding is soldered to the other contact el ement. The coil assembly 31 is subsequently soldered onto a printed circuit board. Each contact element 37, 38 may in clude a pin portion 51 to be inserted into a printed circuit board.
