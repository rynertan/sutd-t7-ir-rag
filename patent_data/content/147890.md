# Apparatus for processing articles in a controlled environment.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises an endless tunnel 1 whose wall is provided with openings 2 and 5, respectively giving access to processing chambers 3, 4 and a lock chamber 6 which has a panel 7 which seals the apparatus from the external environment. A conveyor 11 which follows a closed path is arranged in the tunnel 1 and is provided with seats 12, 13 for containers 14 with articles to be processed and transport means 17, 18, 19 for introducing articles, which are carried by the conveyor 11 into positions each of which is opposite to a chamber 3, 4, 6 , into the respective chamber. The apparatus has means 21 26 by which the environments in the tunnel 1 and in each of the chambers 3, 4, 6 can be controlled. The chambers 3, 4, 6 can each be sealed from the tunnel 1 in a vacuum tight manner. By means of the apparatus, articles, which are screened from the surroudings in a vacuum tight manner, can be subjected in controlled environments to a variety of processing steps.
