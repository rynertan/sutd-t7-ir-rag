# Clutch driven plate assembly with anti backlash damping.

## Abstract
A clutch driven plate assembly for use in an automotive vehicle and having anti backlash damping adapted to dissipate the irregular impulses of the vehicle internal combustion or diesel engine with the transmission in neutral, the clutch engaged and the engine at idle rpm. The assembly includes a clutch plate 31 , a spring retainer plate 41 secured to the clutch plate, and a hub assembly 11 comprising an inner hub 12 in operative engagement with the transmission input shaft and an outer hub 18 having an integral hub flange 26 with spring windows 27 coinciding with the spring windows 33, 34 of the clutch and spring retainer plates. An intermeshing backlash spline 15, 22 loosely connects said inner 12 and outer 18 hubs to allow limited relative rotation therebetween and means yieldably resisting relative rotation of said hubs in cludes a plurality of circumferentially equally spaced recesses 16 in one hub and a plurality of plungers 47 and compression springs 51 in the other hub with the plungers biased by the springs into engagement with complementary recesses. Rota tion of the clutch 31 and spring retainer plates 41 , damper springs 28 and outer hub 18 relative to the inner hub 12 causes the plungers 47 to be cammed out of the recesses against the force of the compression springs 51 .
