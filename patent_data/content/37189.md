## Description
Liquid Coatinq CompositionsThis invention relates to liquid coating compositions, and more particularly to liquid coating compositions having a basis of aminoplast resin as the predominant reactive ingredient, with a smaller proportion of a polymer containing one or more hydroxyl qroups.Such liquid coating compositions can be made by dissolvinq the aminoplast resin and the hydroxyl group containing polymer in an organic solvent of relatively low boiling point bp less than 1600C , for example a low molecular weight alcohol, ketone, or ester, in which an acid such as an arylsulphonic acid is included as curing catalyst. When the composition is brushed or sprayed on or likewise applied to a surface to be coated, for protection or decoration say, the organic solvent quickly evaporates leaving behind a film in which the aminoplast resin and the hydroxyl group containinq polymer react with one another at ambient temperature under the influence of the catalyst, forming a cured film.However, in order to obtain such a composition having a viscosity low enough to make it easily applicable viscosity not greater than about 2.5 poise at 250C , the weight proportion of organic solvent that has to be employed is relatively high, being about 3 1 or more. The solvent forms no part of the eventual cured coating, and is in that sense wasted. Moreover, in evaporating it pollutes the working environment. The present invention provides an aminoplast resin hydroxyl group containing polymer liquid coating composition of the kind defined in which the proportion of solvent employed is considerably reduced, so that less is wasted and this composition includes the chemically reactive liquid known as caprolactone, which is the lactone of 6 hydroxyhexanoic acid, boiling at about 2300C.The use of caprolactone as a reactive liquid in stoving lacquers of high resin content is proposed inBritish Patent Specification 1464061 Example 1 of which describes a coating composition curing at 1250C and comprising by weight 90 parts of an alkyd resin, 18 parts of aminoplast resin in particular, a methylated i.e. methyl etherified melamine formaldehyde resin , 18 parts of caprolactone and 10 parts of ethyl glycol acetate solvent , with p toluene sulphonic acid as acid curing catalyst. The present invention differs in that it is applied to systems in which, of the reactive ingredients, the aminoplast resin predominates.The invention arises from our discovery that, in the presence of the curing catalyst, E caprolactone reacts rapidly with such aminoplast predominant systems at ambient temperature e.g. in the range 20 25 C. According to the invention, there is provided a liquid coating composition curable in film form at ambient temperature comprising the following reactive ingredients in the following proportions by weight Aminoplast resin 50 90 Hydroxyl group containing polymer 5 25 E Caprolactone 5 35 said reactive ingredients being dissolved together with an acid curing catalyst in an organic solvent of boiling point below 1600C the composition having a viscosity not greater than about 2.5 poise at 250C and having a weight proportion solvent reactive ingredients not greater than 3 2.The caprolactone in the composition of the invention functions essentially as co solvent with the low boiling organic solvent until evaporation of the latter has appreciably raised the concentration of the reactive ingredients. The caprolactone then reacts with the aminoplast and the hydroxyl group containing polymer ingredients, and so becomes incorporated in the coating that is formed i.e. it is usefully consumed and not wasted. Of course, the solvent of low boiling point is lost as previously, but the proportion of it thus lost is smaller in relation to the weight of composition employed and the weight of coating formed.The invention has particular application to the preparation of ambient temperature curing compositions for coating wood, to give cured films which are resistant to wet heat, as encountered when hot drinks are spilled on them.Preferably, the content of aminoplast resin in the composition is in the range 60 80 by weight of the total reactive ingredients.The aminoplast resin may be a urea formaldehyde or melamine formaldehyde resin, particularly an alkylated one and preferably an alkylated resin is employed in which the alkylating etherifyinq group is methyl, n butyl or isobutyl. The hydroxyl group containing polymer ingredient may be one of the kind known as non convertible , that is to say, one which when dissolved in a solvent in the absence of a curing agent dries, simply by solvent evaporation to give a hard film. A particularly preferred hydroxyl group containing polymer of this class is polyvinylbutyral see Example 1 later . Other such polymers which can be employed are nitro cellulose, cellulose acetate butyrate, and a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer containing hydroxyl groups seeExample 2 .Alkyd resins form another class of hydroxyl group containing polymers which are useful in carryinq out the invention. The use of such resins, which preferably have a molecular weight less than 7,500, is illustrated in Examples 3,4 and 5 later.A variety of low boiling organic liquids, singly or in admixture with one another, may be used as the solvent component of the coating composition, but most suitably a lower aliphatic alcohol or ketone preferably one containing not more than 6 carbon atoms is employed, optionally in admixture with a liquid aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene.The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Examples.
