# A variable inlet area turbine turbocharger.

## Abstract
A variable inlet area turbine turbocharger for an internal combustion engine. A compressor is driven by a turbine hav ing an inlet and an outlet, and the turbine inlet area is control led as a function of a control pressure signal such that the turbine inlet area increases as a direct function of the control pressure signal. The control pressure signal corresponds to whichever is the greater of the turbine inlet pressure and the compressor outlet pressure.
