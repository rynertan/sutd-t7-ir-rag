# APPARATUS FOR VERIFYING CODE SIGNALS IN THE VERTICAL BLANKING INTERVAL

## Abstract
Apparatus for verifying the accuracy of insertion of code signals in the vertical intervals of video signals. The code sig nals are inserted in accordance with a procedure characteris tic of a specified encoding format. The accuracy of insertion is verified by testing the codes against a predetermined set of conditions related to the procedure. Failure to meet one of the conditions results in the generation of an error signal.
