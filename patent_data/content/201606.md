# INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE CAPABLE OF MONITORING MOLDING PROCESS.

## Abstract
An injection molding machine which simultaneously displays various kinds of variables in several molding cycles ranging from the present to the past, so that the molding process can be monitored. Detected variables in the present molding cycle are stored into a present value storage portion of a memory 14 . After each molding cycle is completed, a CPU 11 transfers the data from both present value storage portion and past variable storage portion storing a variety of variables in the past several cycles to a past variable storage portion for one cycle before, in order to successively renew the data stored into said storage portion. The renewed data and the present data are read and displayed on a display device 18 4 Screw rotating drive unit 5 Injection drive unit 6 7 Servo circuit 12 Input circuit 13 Output circuit 14 Memory 15 Manual input unit 16 CRT control Circuit
