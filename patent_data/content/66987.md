A GrassModel 7 polygraph was used for recording femoral arterial blood pressure Statham P23AC transducer and the electrocardiogram Grass 7P4 preamplifier .Ouabain was given intravenously in an initial dose of 40 Mg kg and in a second dose of 20 pg kg 30 minutes after the first dose and in subsequent doses of 10 pg kg which were repeated at 15 min intervals as required for producing cardiac arrhythmias that persisted for at least 15 minutes.. When the arrhythmias were established, the test compounds were administered by infusion HarvarSd Model 942 Infusion Pump into a femoral vein at a rate of 1 mg kg min. Concentration of compound was adjusted according to the weight of the dog to allow a volume infusion of 1 ml min. The compound was considered to be active as antiarrhythmic agent if reversion to to sinus rhythm occurred which was maintained for at least 30 min. Coronary Artery Libation Induced Arrhythmias Adult mongrel dogs which are in the conscious state were used for the test and cardiac arrhythmias were induced by prior 22 24 hr surgical preparation in which blood flow through a coronary artery was occluded by use of a constrictor device as reported by Smith et al, 1973. A Grass Model 79 polygraph was used for recording the electrocardiogram Grass 7Ph preamplifier . The test compound was administered by infusion HowardModel 942 Infusion Pump into a sapheneous vein to one group of dogs at a rate of 0.5 mg kg min. Concentration of compound was adjusted according to the weight of the dog to allow a volume of infusion of 0.5 ml min. The test compound was administered orally by gavage to another group of dogs at dose levels of 10 to 40 mg kg. The test compound was prepared in distilled water to give a total volume of 20 ml.Following the administration of the test compound, the heart rate number of ectopic cardiac beats per min and the percent ectopic beats Ectopic beats HR X100 were recorded at 15 min intervals. The compound was considered active if it abolished the ectopic ventricular frequency and caused a return to normal sinus rhythm within 2 hours of administration. Injury Stimulus Induced Arrhythmias Correction of existing arrhythmias of atrial origin is carried out on adult mongrel dogs which are under barbiturate anesthesia and mechanical respiration Harvard RespirationPump Model 6B . During the test a Grass Model 7 polygraph was used for recording femoral arterial blood pressure Statham P23AC Transducer and the electrocardiogram Grass 7p4 preamplifier . The heart was exposed by an incision at the fourth intercostal space of the right thorax and the right atrium was exposed. A band of right atrial tissue lying between the superior and inferior vena cava was crushed using hemostatic forceps. Atrial arrhythmias were initiated by applying an electrical stimulus of 1 m sec, 20 100Hz and 3 5 V to the crushed area Method of Rosenbluth GarciaRamos .When the arrhythmias were established and persisted for at least 15 min , the test compound was administered by infusion Harvard Model 940 Infusion Pump into a femoral vein at a rate of 1 mg kg min. Concentration of the test compound was adjusted according to the weight of the dog to allow a volume infusion of 1 ml min. The compound was considered active as an anti arrhythmic agent if the induced arrhythmia atrial flutter or atrial fibrilation was reverted to a normal sinus rhythm and the atrial frequency is diminished in order that a 1 1 relationship of atrial and ventricular was established. Acetylcholine Induced Arrhythmias Protection activity against the induction of cardiac arrhythmias of atrial origin were carried out in adult mongrel dogs which were under barbiturate anetsthesia and mechanical respiration XIarvard Respiration Pump Model 613 .A Grass Model 7 Polygraph was used for recording femoral arterial blood pressure P23Ac Transducer and the electrocardiogram. The heart was exposed by an incision at the fourth intercostal space of the right thorax and the right atrium was exposed. An atrial arrhythmia was produced by placing 2 drops of a lO aqueous solution of acetylcholine directly on the right atrium and stroking the area of application with a cotton applicator Method of Scherf BR Chick . The time period of the arrhythmia was determined by noting the spontaneous return of the sinus. rhythm of the electrocardiogram. This procedure was repeated at 15 min.intervals until at least 2 consecutive periods of arrhythmia of comparable duration were obtained. The test compound was administered intravenously as an aqueous solution at an initial dose of I mg active compound per kilogram of body weight. After drug administration, attempts were made up to 60 min to reproduce the arrhythmia.Higher dosages of the test compound were administered if lower levels failed to prevent the occurrence of the arrhythmia during the 60 min trial period. Data obtained for one preferred compound namely, N 52 3,5 dichlorophenoxy ethyl 1i 2 dimet hylamino ethyl3 N 1 methylethyl urea as represented by its maleate salt ofExample 3 are shown in Table 3. This compound exhibited minimal CNS side effects as compared to quint dine and lidocaine. The other compounds of this invention show qualitatively by similar effects in one or more types of arrhythmias as represented by the foregoing tests and generally exhibit less side effects than quinidine or lidocaine.

Pharmaceutical Compositions The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions for administration to a living animal body comprising, as active ingredients, at least one of the compounds according to the invention in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The cdmpounds are thus presented in a therapeutic composition suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral or intracardial administration.Thus, for example, compositions for oral administration are preferably solids and can take the form of capsules, tablets or coated tablets containing carriers conveniently used in the pharmaceutical art. Suitable tableting excipients include lactose, potato and maize starches, talc, gelatin and stearic and silicic acids, magnesium stearate and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. For parenteral administration, the carrier or excipient can be a sterile, parenterally acceptable liquid e.g., water, or a parenterally acceptable oil e.g., arachis oil, contained in ampoules. In compositions for rectal administration the carrier can comprise a suppository bases e.g., cocoa butter, or a glyceride. Advantageously, the compositions are formulated as dosage units, each unit being adapted to supply a fixed dose of active ingredients. Tablets, coated tablets, capsules, ampoules and suppositories are examples of preferred dosage forms according to the invention. It is only necessary that the active ingredient constitute an effective amount i.e., such that a suitable effective dosage will be obtained consistent with the dosage form employed. The exact individual dosages, as well as daily dosages, will, of course, be determined according to standard medical principles under the direction of 2 physician or veterinarian. Generally, the pharmacology on animals suggests that the oral dosage effective to correct arrhythmias will be about 3 times that of the intravenous dosage. The animal data also suggest dosage requirements will be about half that of quinidine for the more active compounds. Based on the animal data, allowing for variation in species and severity of cardiac arrhythmia unit dosages containing an amount of compound equivalent to about 1 to about 100 mghcg of body weight, are contemplated. Based on all of the above considerations, a choice in a range of unit oral dosages for humans of about 10 to about 1000 mg is contemplated, preferably about 10 to 60o mg for a more active compound such as Example 3. Daily dosages of about 30 to 2400 mg are contemplated for humans and obviously several unit dosage forms may be administered at about the same time. However, the scope of the invention is not to be limited by these contemplations due to the uncertainty in transpositions discussed above. Examples of unit dosage compositions are as follows EXAMPLE 66 Capsules may be prepared as follows Ingredients Per Capsule 1. Active ingredient 10.0 mg 2. Lactose 146.0 mg 3. Magnesium Stearate 4.0 mg Ingredients 1, 2 and 3 were blended. This blend was then milled and blended again. This milled blend was then filled into num 1 hard gelatin capsules. EXAMPLES 67A and 67B Tablets may be prepared as follows Ingredients Mg Tablet 1. Active ingredient 10.0 mg 2. Corn starch 20.0 mg 3. Kelacid 20.0 mg 4. Keltose 20.0 mg 5. Magnesi m stearate 1.3 mg This is Example 67A. EXAMPLE 67B Ingredients Mg Tablet 1. Active ingredient 50.0 mg 2. Milo starch 20.0 mg 3. Corn starch 38.0 mg 4. Lactose 90.0 mg 5. Calcium stearate 2.0 mg 200.0 mg The procedure for both Examples 67A and 67B was to blend ingredients 1, 2, 3 and 4 and then add sufficient water portionwise to the blend with careful stirring after each addition. Such additions of water and stirring were continued until the mass was of a consistency to permit its conversiono wet granules. The wet mass was converted to granules by passing it through an oscillating granulator, using 8 mesh screen U.S. Sieve series which has openings of mms .The wet granules were then dried in an oven at 1400F OC . The dried granules were then passed through an oscillating granulator, using a 10 mesh screen U.S. Sieve series which has openings of mms .
