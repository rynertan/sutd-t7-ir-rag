## Abstract
A pump 10 is provided with a vortex generaing member 35 which rotates about a central axis 32 to generate a vortex column 30 of liquid which has a rotary velocity and which is directed to the pump inlet 15 . At the pump inlet, this energy is dissipated into the ambient liquid 16 causing an inward flow of liquid swirling in an opposite direction into and through the pump inlet 15 for discharge through a pump outlet 18 . The preferred vortex generating member 35 has a plurality of outer liquid inlets 42 leading to passageways 48 of reducing cross section which causes the liquid to increase in velocity as the liquid flows radially inwardly toward the axis 32 and liquid streams are combined tangentially at the axis. The pump is particularly useful for pumping liquids with particulate content and overcomes the problem of abrasion between moving parts by such matter.
