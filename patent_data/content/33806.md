# HIGH NITRILE COPOLYMER RESINS HAVING IMPROVED IMPACT RESISTANCE

## Abstract
The inclusion of small amounts of epoxidised vege table oils into high nitrile copolymers produces composi tions of higher impact resistance. Representative oils are epoxidised soybean oil, linseed oil or butyl linseed oil. They are incorporated in an amount of from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of high nitrile polymer. A preferred polymer is a nitrile rubber modified copolymer of 75 by weight of acrylonitrile and 25 by weight of methyl acrylate.
