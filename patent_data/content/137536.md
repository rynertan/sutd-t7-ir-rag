## Description
ChERSE FLAUORED SUBSIPNCE Field of the Invention the invention relates to a method for makinq a substance having a cheese like flavor utilizinq a source of lipase, protease or both, at least one strain of lactic acid producing bacteria and a median having from about 0.3 to about 12 protein and fran about less than 2 to about 85 fat. The median is fermented for a period of tine under anerobic conditions until a pH between 4.5 and 5.5 is reached, at which time a substance having a cheese like flavor develops and the lipase or protease or lipase and protease are inactivated. A relatively law solids cheeseflavored substance is produced. The low solids cheese flavor may be concentrated to 95 solids in dry powdered form or concentrated into a paste form in a range of between 40 and 75 solids. Badground of the Invention The production of cheese by traditional methods is a timeconsuming process. The starting material for such traditional cheeses invariably is whole milk or whole milk that has either been augmented with milk fat or treated to separate hiqh milk fat oontaining fractions which are used for the production of cheese fran relatively lower milk fatoontaininq fractions. The production of cheese having good flavor by such traditional methods is a cortex process that is not well Understood.What is understood, however, is that the flavors that give the various cheese their distinctive charactertistics are gradually produced during ripening times which may vary from 2 3 months to well over one year at controlled temperatures. Because of the long and exactinq storage conditions for the ripening process such traditionally produced cheeses are an expensive delicacy for a small segment of the cheese consuming population. hn alternative approach to the production of cheeses havinq a distinctive and pleasing flavor is to obtain a cheese flavored substance, via various processes, having a distinctive cheese flavor and to add this cheese flavored substance to a relatively young cheese, i.e., one that has not been subjected to a lons aging process, or to a cheese that has not developed a distinctive flavor. Such cheese flavored substances, of course, have a more general application in the food industry.They may be used to impart a cheese flavor to a variety of foods, including processed cheeses, which include natural cheese, color, salt and emulsifiers processed cheese foods which include, in addition to the ingredients of processed cheese, certain optional ingredients such as skim milk, whey, milk cream, albunim and skim milk cheese or processed cheese spreads which include, in addition to the ingredients in processed cheese food, gums and the like for water retention. Cheese flavored substances fur theritore may be used to impart a distinctive cheese flavor to imitation cheese. Moreover, such distinctive cheese flavors can be used in a number of non cheese type foods.For example, they can be used in baked goods such as cheese flavored crackers, chips, breads, cakes, and the like. In general, cheese flavored substances may be produced by one of t methods. In the first method, a traditionally produced unripened cheese having no distinctive flavor is subjected to enzymatic digestion.The digest is combined with various ingredients and added to the food product to be produced. Although it is possible to produce relatively larqe amounts of cheese flavored substances by this general process, it has the distinct disadvantage of a relatively expensive startinq material. A second approach to producing cheese flavor is to employ fermentative techniques. Cheese flavored substances produced by processes of this type have almost always used substrates having relatively high milk fat concentrations on the order of between 30 and 80 on a solids basis. Usually, such high milk fat substances take the form of cream or butter. In qeneral, these processes all utilize substrates having relatively low protein concentrations, usually not exceedinq 3 on a weiqht volume basis.Although it is possible, using these conventional fermentation processes, to produce substances having distinct cheese tastes in a relatively short period of time on the order of 2 5 days these conventional techniques have the distinct disadvantaqe of requiring relatively expensive starting materials as substrates. Moreover, these startinq materials are subject to spoilage in short periods of time if not stored under proper conditions, usually requirinq refriqeration. Thus, the substrates used in conventional techniques entail considerable expense in acquisition and storage. Summary of the Invention The process for producing the cheese flavored substance according to the instant invention may be briefly described as a mixed culture fermentation of a flavor development medium. The components of the mixed culture fermentation are a source of lipase or protease or lipase and protease herein referred to as lipase protease , and at least one lactic acid producing microorganism and a flavor development medium. It is preferred that the source of lipase trotease is a lipase rotease producinq microorganism. The lipasejprotease producinq miroorqanism s may be produced in t stages.In the first stage of the t stages, the inoculum development stage, the lipaseiprotease prsducing orqanism s is grown for a period of time in aerobic conditions in a complete inoulum development medium. In the second of the two stages an aliquot of the inoulum devel opment medium containing the lipaseAprDtease producing orqanism s is placed in a first starter development medium and is cultured under aerobic conditions for a period of time. At the same time, at least one lactic acid producing microoraanism is qrown anaerobically in a second starter development medium for a period of time. After the first starter development medium containinq the lipase protease producing microorganism and the second starter development medium containing at least one lactic acid producinq microorganism have both reached a predetermined stage of growth, aliquots of each of the starter development media containing the respective microorganisms are inoculated into the flavor development medium. The flavor development medium is fermented by the mixed culture of microorganisms for a period of time until a cheese flavor develops at which time the lipasepotease and lactic acid producing microorganism are inactivated. The process is described in further detail hereinbelow. The process accordinq to the subiect invention is a mixed fermentation of a flavor development medium utilizing a source of lipase protease and at least one lactic acid producinq microorganism. The sources of lipase and protease may be any purified or partially purified preparations of lipase and protease.Such purified and partially purfied sources of enzyme are readily available oommercially. Alternatively, the process according to the invention is a mixed fermentation of a flavor development medium by at least one lactic acid producinq microorganism and, as the source of lipase proteaset a lipose protease producing microorganism. The term lipaseXprotease producing microorganism as used herein is intended to include any lipase producing microorganism, preferably any extracellular lipase producing microorganism any proteaseproducing microorganism, preferably any extracellular protease producing microorganism a combination of lipaseroducing microorganism and protease producing microorganism or any lipase and protease producing microorganism. The choice of lipase protease producing microorganism will depend upon the contents of the flavor development medium. The process according to the invention also encompasses a mixed fermentation of a flavor development medium in which the source of lipase protease is a purified or partially purified preparation of lipase protease and a lipase protease producing microorganism. Thus, within the scOpe of the invention are fermentations of a flavor development medium in which the source of lipase protease may be a purified or partially purified protease and a lipase producinq microorganism, a purified or partially purified lipase and a protease producing microroganism or a lipase and protease producing microorganism supplemented with a purified or partially purified lipase or protease or both. Preferably the lipaseAprDtease producing microrganism will be nonopathoqenic, and particularly nonpathogenic to man. In particular, microorganisms such as Penicillum especially Pennicillum roqueforti ,Oidum lactis, Cladisporum especially Cladisporum butaryi , Micrococcus and Candida especially Candida lipolytica are suitable microorganisms.Preferred in the process according to the present invention is Candida lipolytica and in particular, Candida lipolytica deposited in the american Type Culture Collection, Rcckville, Maryland USA under the assession num bers ATCC 8661, ATCC 20320 and ATCC 20324. Especially preferred isCandida lypolytica ATCC 20324. As mentioned above, at least one lactic acid producing microorganism is used in the fermentation or mixed fermentation process according to the invention. Lactic acid producing microorganisms suitable for this purpose are desirably dairy strains of lactic acid producing organisms. Dairy strains of lactic acid producing microorganisms include the anuses Streptococcus S. , Lactobacillus L. , beuconostoc Le. ,Micrococcus M. , Citrobacter C. and Brevibacterium B. . Within the genus Streptococcus, S. cremoris, S. lactis, S. thermphilous and S.diacetilactis are examples. Within the qenus Lactobacillus, L. casei, L.bulgaricus, L. acidophilous, L. delbrueckii, and L. helveticus are examples. Within the genus leuconostoc, te. cremoris, Le. dextranicum and 12. citrovorum are examples. Within the genus Micrococcus, M. caselytics,M. conglomeratus and M. freudenreichii are examples. Within the genusCitrobacter, C. intermedii and C. freudii are examples. Within the genusBrevibacterium, B. linens is an example. It is preferred in the process according to the invention, to use two lactic acid producing microorganisms, and although any two of the above listed lactic acid producing microorganisms are usable, S. lactis and L. casei are preferred. Particularly preferred for the S. lactis isS. lactis strain C2 kindly furnished by W.E. Sandine of Oregon StateUniversity at Corvallis, Oregon. Also preferred is L. casei. 101 ATCC 39392. The lipaseXprotease prcducinq microorganism s and lactic acidproducing microorqanis used in the mixed fermentation according to the invention are separately developed for subsequent inoculation into the flavor development medium. The lipase brotease producinq microorganism s is developed for inoculation in two stages, both of which are carried out under aerobic conditions. In the first of the two stages, the lipase protease producing microorganism s is inoculated into an inoculum development medium which is a complete medium suitable for growth of the lipasevprotease producing microorganism s .Preferably, the complete medium will contain all the substances necessary for viqorous and sustained growth of the lipase protease producing microorganism s . In general, such a medium will be a standard bacterial culture medium supplemented with yeast extract Y . Examples of such media include but are not limited to Nutrient Broth produced by Difco , Yeast Morphology Broth Difoo , Peptone Difoo , and Tryptocase Soy Broth TSB Bethesda Bioloqical Laboratories, hereinafter BBL . Yeast extract is available from Difoo and Stauffer Chemical Cbmpany hereinafter SCC under the tradename KAT, Preferably Candida lipolytica is inoculated into a three percent TSB 1 Y medium and is grown aerobically for a period of time and at a temperature sufficient to yield a predetermined cell titre, generally between 106 109 cellsAnilliliter ml . A suitable temperature will range between 23 35eC. 30eC is preferred, at which temperature the first staqe of development will require from about 16 to about 18 hours. In the second stage of development of the lipase protease producing microorganism s for inoculation, an aliguot of the lipase protease producing microorganism s , obtained at the end of the first stage is inoculated into a first starter development medium and is cultured aerobically. The starter development medium may be any substrate that will support the vigorous growth of the lipase protease producing microrganism s and the production of lipase or protease or both lipase and protease.Such substrates include whole milk, non fat dry milk NEDM resuspended in water, fluid skim milk, whey, concentrated whey, ar dried whey such as Teklaca Formost resuspended in water. The foregoing starter development substrates may be used sinqly or in any combination together. If NFDM is used, it is preferably resuspended in water to about 10 wt iol . If con concentrated whey or dried whey is used as the substrate, it is diluted or resuspended at a concentration of about 7 to about 15 wtibol . The inoculated first starter development medium is incubated at about 30 C for 12 hours or until cell titres reach from about 108 to about 5 x 108 cellsAnl. During the incubation period the pH rises from about 6.4 to about 7.0. During incubation of the first starter development medium, lipase, protease or lipase and protease activity is monitored. Lipase activity in a range of about 11 units U fil to about 30 U ml is desirable. Preferably the lipase activity will be between about 20 U ml and 26 UAfll as determined by using Lipase Test Kit No. BOOB, available from Siqma Biochemicals, St. Louis, Missouri. Protease activity during the first starter development staqe is monitored by speutrophototmetrically measuring the absorbance of soluble azure blue dye liberated by proteolysis of hide azure powder Calbiochem Catalogue 37716 by an aliquot of the first starter development medium. The lactic acid producing microorganisms are separately cultured in a second starter development medium. The lactic acid producing microorganism s is are inoculated into any dairy starter medium suitable for the vigorous growth of the lactic acid producing microorganisms. Examples of such dairy starter media include a product sold under the name In Suree Hansen s, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53214 , Funnel Grade Miles Labs,, Marschall Div., Wisconsin , MSM Miles Labs., Marschall Div., Wisconsin ,Cne 2 one Miles Labs., Marschall Div., Wisconsin , T.S.S. DederichCorp., Germantown, Wisconsin , Phage Stat CbTplete Pfizer, New York, NewYork and Phase 4 GallowayWµst, Fond Du Lac, Wisconsin . The lactic acid producing microorganisms are inoculated into the second starter development medium fan slants and the medium is incubated for a sufficient period of time, generally between about 12 and 30 hours, at a sufficient temperature, generally in a range of between about 23µ and about 35 C to bring the second starter development medium to a pH from about 5.3 to about 5.5. Preferably, the incubation proceeds for about 20 hours at 300C at which time the cell titre for each of the lactic acidproducing microorganisms used will generally equal or exceed 108 cells ml.The duration of and temperature for the incubation of the second starter development medium can be varied as necessary so that the first starter development medium and second starter development medium are ready for transfer into the flavor development medium when needed. Aliquots of the first and second starter development media that have incubated to the extent desired are transferred into a flavor development medium. In general, the transfer of the first starter development medium containing the lipase prDtease prnducing microorganism s will be in a range of from about 3 to about 20 wtiol of the flavor development medium. An inoculum of the first starter development medium of about 10 wtvol is preferred. Th general, the transfer of the second starter development medium containing the lactic acid producing microorganisms will be in a range of from about 0.5 to about 4 wtArol . An inoculum of the second starter development medium of about 1 to 2 wt vol is preferred. The flavor development medium may be simultaneously inoculated with transfers of both the first and second starter development cultures.In this case, the whole period of fermentation of the flavor development medium will involve mixed culture fermentation. Alternatively, the flavor development medium may be sequentially inoculated with transfers of the first and second starter cultures with a period of time between the to transfers. For example, the flavor development medium may be inoculated with a transfer of the first starter development mediun containinq C.lipolytica and, after a period of time, may be inoculated with a transfer of the second starter development medium containing the lactic acidproducing microorganisms without heat inactivation of the lipase protease prior to addition of the lactic acid producing microorqanisms. The flavor development medium may also be supplemented during the course of its fermentation. For example, a flavor development medium comprised of NFDM and and H may be fermented for a period of time with the lipase f rotease producing microorganism. The flavor development medium is then innoculated with the lactic acid producing microorganism and is sup plemented with a source of protein, for example, NFnM or casein, and after a further period of time, butter. This flavor development medium is further fermented to the desired degree of oompleteness. The flavor development medium may be comprised of skim milk, defined as milk having less than 2 milk fat, whole milk, non fat dry milk, whey, whey protein concentrate, butter, cream or any other dairy product acceptable by the Food and Drug Administration Standards for the making of processed cheese food. Furthermore, if the cheese flavored substance is to be used in imitaticn cheese veqetable oils preferably those including fatty acids of 10 carbons inclusive or less, for example coconut oil, palm and and the like , casein and animal milk fats may be used. The flavor development medium may have a fat content of from less than 2 to 50 on a weiqht volume percent basis. The protein content will generally range fran about 0.7 to about 3 wtJ ol protein. Preferred is a flavor develoanent medium comprising whole milk and butter. The flavor development medium is fermented at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to reduce the pH of the flavor development medium to about 5. If a temperature of 300C is used the fermentation time will range between about 8 and about 24 hours dependinq on the amount of fat in the flavor development medium. Lower fermentation temperatures require conaxnitantly longer periods of time. If the flavor development medium has a relatively high butter fat content, the butyric acid concentration of the flavor development medium may be monitored instead of or along with pH. A butyric acid concentration reaching about 1 wtfiol is preferred. When the proper pH or butyric acid concentration is reached, the fermentation process is terminated by heat inactivation at a temperature sufficiently high to inactivate any microganism s , protease, lipase or all three. Generally, raising the temperature to about 850C for about 45 minutes is sufficient. Alternatively, the above mentioned microorganisms and enzymes may be, inactivated by exposinq the flavor development medium to very high temperatures exceeding 100 C for short periods of time. A cheese flavored substance is thus formed that may be spray dried, freeze dried, con concentrated, or kept in unconcentrated form. If spray dried, a solids content of about 95 is desirable. If concentrated, a paste consistency of fram about 40 to about 60 solids is desirable. Such paste form of the cheese flavored substance may have a fat content range of from less than 2 to about 85 . The spray dried product will have a fat content range of from less than 2 to about 55 of the solids and a protein content range of from about 1 to about 40 of the solids. In general, a protein content of from about 21 to about 38 and fat concentration of fran less than about 2 to 40 is desirable in the spray dried product. The cheese flavored substance produced by the above described process may be used as a cheese flavor in processed cheese foods, and processed cheese spreads or may be added to various foods including imita tion cheese and cheese flavored snack foods. The process for producing the cheese flavored substance and the cheese flavored substance produced thereby will be better understood from the following examples which are intended by the inventor to be exemplary only and non limiting.

EXAMPLE VII A fermentation product designated F4B was prepared by the following method. 150 ml of the first starter development medium obtained at the end of the 16 hour incubation period described in Example Iv hereinabove was supplemented with a previously autoclaved 30 min mixture containing about 750 g whole milk and 750 g skim milk, and about 20 ml of each of the second starter development medium containing S. lactis C2 and L. casei TA 101. The initial fat content of the flavor development medium was about 1.75 . After 12 hours of anaerobic fermentation a pH of 5.52 was reached. The fermentation was nuetralized, halted by heat inactivation and concentrated as described in Example IV. EXAMPLE VIII Four fermentation products designated F1C, F2C, F3C and F4C were prepared by the following method. An inoculation medium of 200 ml 3 TSB, 1 Y was inoculated with C. lipolytica 20324 washed from a TSB slant and was incubated aerobically for approximately 18 hours at 300C with agitation. A first starter development medium of 1000 ml skim milk and 0.3 ml P 2000 in a BioFlo fermentator was autoclaved for 30 minutes, cooled to 30 C and inoculated with an approximately 20 ml transfer of the inoculation medium at pH 6.5 and was incubated aerobically with agitation at 30C for about 12 hours. The pH was controlled at 6.5 with 45 HAC food grade acetic acid. A second starter development medium of 7 In SureX was inoculated with S. lactis C2 and L. casei TA 101 and incubated for 24 hours at 30 C. Four fermenters were prepared with various flavor development media as follows F1C 1500 ml skim milk 1500 ml skzm milk and 112 9 NFDM F3C 1500 ml skim milk and 112 q Alacene 855 a whey protein concen trate, supplied by New Zealand Milk Products, Inc., Petaluma, California F4C 800 ml skim milk, 800 ml H2O 120 g Alacen 55 and 120 g Teklac Each of the flavor development media had fat contents of less than 0.5a on fluid bases and less than 2 on solids bases.Each of the flavor development media was autoclaved for 30 minutes and then placed in a oold roan at about 4 C overniqht. F3C and F4C congealed and 200 ml skim milk was added to each to fluidize the qelled mass. Each fermenter containing the above described flavor development media was inoculated with about 150 ml of the first starter development mediun that had incubated for about 12 hours. The flavor development media were cultured anaerobically at 30eC with agitation at 500 rpn for 4 hours at which time the second starter development media containing S.lactis and L. casei were inoculated with a 1 transfer. pH was monitored and after about 8 hours the flavor development media reached a pH between 5.2 and 5.5. The flavor development media were then heated to 80 C for about 90 minutes. After cold storage overnight at 40C, each of the flavor development media was divided into two portions. The first portion was freeze dried. Butter was added to the second portion to a protein fat ratio of 1 2 and then freeze dried. EXAMPLE IX Three fermentation products designated F1D, F2D and F3D were prepared by the following method. An inoculation mediun of 500 ml 3 TSB and 1 Y was inoculated with C. lipolytica ATCC 20324 and was incubated aerobically for approximately 24 hours at 300C with agitation. Two ali quots of a starter development mediun comprising 150 ml of 7 Cul Surea SCC, Clawson, MI that had been previously autoclaved were inoculated, one with S. lactis and the other with L. casei2 The starter development media were incubated aerobically for approximately 24 hours at 300C. Three BioFlo fermentors azure prepared with various flavor development media as follows F1D 150 g NFDM and H2O to 1350 ml FZD 100 g NFDM and H to 900 mlF3D 60 g NFrM and H 540 ml A 10 transfer of the previously grown Candida lipolytica inoculation culture was made to each fermenter so that the final volumes were 1500 ml, 1000 ml and 600 ml for F1D, F2D and F3D respectively. The flavor development media were cultured at 31 C at 200 rpn and aerated at 0.7 volumes of airAflltite culture hin. The pH of F2D was held at a pH of about 6 for the first 10 hours of this period, and thereafter at about pH 6.5. F1D and F3D were held at 6.5 through this period.After approximately 11.5 hours aeration was stopped and 30 ml of each of the previously cultured S. lactis and L. casei cultures were added to each fermentor. F2D was further supplemented with 66 q casein and 265 ml H20 F3D was further supplemented with 60 g NFDM and 540 q H20. me e flavor development media were further cultured anaerobically for approximately 3 hours. 124 g, 250 q, and 125 g of butter were then added to F7D, F2D andF3D respectively. The cultures were incubated anaerobically for an additional 5 hours at which time they were heat inactivated in a water bath for 90 minutes at 85 900C. The product was oon concentrated to a paste by freeze drying. EXAMPLE X Fermentation products F1A, F2A, F3A, F1D, F2D and F3D were evaluated for taste in a preparation of unflavored processed cheese. Each of the fermentation products was blended into an unflavored cheese spread loaf containing no aged cheese. The fermentation products were added at a weight to weight ratio of 3 . Cheese spreads containing F2A, F3A, F2D andF3D prepared in this manner were reported to have a clean cheesy flavor with either no whey flavor or slight whey flavor. Cheese spreads containing F1A and F1D were reported to have cheesey flavor and an additional either slightly fermented or sliahtly unclean flavor. EXAMPLE XI Fermentation products F1B, F2B, F3B, and F4B were evaluated for taste. The freeze dried samples were reconstituted with water to a paste of 40 solids. The paste was blended into an unflavored process cheese spread loaf formulation having no aged cheese. The paste constituted 2.5 wtXwt of the final cheese spread loaf formultion. The cheese formulations were all reported to have a distinct cheese flavor, with additional flavor notes characterized as either buttery flavored, lypolytic type cheese flavored and or sour.
