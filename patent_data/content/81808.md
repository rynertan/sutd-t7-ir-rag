## Abstract
An ink wiping device for an intaglio rotary printing machine comprises a tank 1 for containing a cleaning liquid 2 therein, an ink wiping roller 3 rotatably supported in the tank 1 and having a circumferential surface positioned for rolling contact with a printing plate 5 of the intaglio rotary printing machine, the ink wiping roller 3 having a portion immersible in the cleaning liquid 2 , and a cleaning assembly 17, 18 disposed in the tank 1 and immersible in the cleaning liquid 2 for cleaning the circumferential surface of the ink wiping roller 3 . The cleaning assembly 17, 18 includes at least one brush unit 17 adjustably supported in the tank 1 and having a plurality of rows of bristles 17a having distal ends located in the vicinity of the circumferential surface of the ink wiping roller 3 , and a cleaning sheet 18 of synthetic fibered nonwoven cloth supported on the brush unit 17 and interposed between the circumferential surface of the ink wiping roller 3 and the distal ends of the bristles 17a . Ink that has been removed and transferred from the printing plate 5 to the ink wiping roller 3 is wiped off the latter by the cleaning sheet 18 pressed against the ink wiping roller 3 under the resiliency of the bristles 17a and is dissolved into the cleaning solution 2 .
