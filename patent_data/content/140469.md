## Abstract
Apparatus 10 for roll forming to neck in D I can ends and replace double necks and triple necks is disclosed. An externally disposed freely rotatable roller 11 is moved inwardly and axially against the outside side wall adjacent the open end of a trimmed can body. A spring loaded interior support roller 24 moves under the forming force of the roller 11 while the body end is borne on and rotated by a rotationally driven support 11 . The rollers 11 and 24 have coacting profiles and, as roller 11 is moved in the inward direction and while the can rotates, a smooth conically necked end and flange are produced in the side wall at the end of the can body.
