## Description
TITLE ACYLATED IMIDAZOLINES AND FUEL AND LUBRICANT COMPOSITIONS THEREOFField of the Invention This invention relates to novel additive compositions for use in lubricants and normally liquid fuels.More particularly, this invention relates to novel additive compositions derived from the interreaction of an unsubstituted succinic acylating agent or an aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituted acylating agent and an imidazoline, to concentrates thereof and to lubricants and normally liquid fuels containing said additive compositions.Description of the Prior Art It is well known that lubricants and normally liquid fuels can cause corrosion of various materials with which they may be brought into contact. For example, it is well known that normally liquid fuels tend to accumulate considerable quantities of water during storage and when subsequently brought into contact with metal surfaces in their functional environment cause deterioration of such surfaces as a result of the formation of rust and corrosion. It is also known that water is a common contaminant in crankcase lubricants for engines. It may result from the oxidation of the lubricating oil or come from the combustion chamber as a blow by product of the burning fuel.The presence of this water, in addition to causing rust and corrosion, also seems to promote the deposition of a mayonnaise like sludge. This type of sludge is even more objec tionable in that it clings tenaciously to metal surfaces and is not removed through filtering. To overcome the corrosive nature of lubricants and normally liquid fuels and to improve the dispersant properties of lubricants, it is common practice to add to such lubricants and fuels minor proportions of anti corrosion and dispersant materials. Many materials have been developed for these purposes including, for example, imidazoline salts of mono and dicresyl phosphates U.S. Pat. No.3,736,110 , mixtures of alkyl or alkenyl succinic acids and N aminoalkyl or N hydroxyalkyl substituted imidazoline salts of alkyl or alkenyl succinic acids U.S. Pat. No.3,282,836 , metal alkyl or alkoxy metal alkyl, ester tetrapropenyl succinates U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,858 , polymerized olefin substituted succinic acid esters U.S. Pat.No. 3,381,022 , and reaction products of partially esterified succinic acid compounds and hydroxyalkylated derivatives of a partially acylated polyamines U.S. Pat. No.3,240,575 , to name but a few and the search continues for others.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments The additive compositions of the present invention are complex products obtained by the interreaction of at least two separate components. Component A is an unsubstituted or aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituted succinic acylating agent and component B an imidazoline. The unsubstituted and aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituted succinic acylating agents, component A , useful in preparing the additive compositions of this invention are the unsubstituted and aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituted succinic acids and anhydrides thereof having the following structural formulas Anhydride AcidEMI5.1 where R is hydrogen or an aliphatic hydrocarbon based radical containing from about 4 to about 100 carbon atoms, preferably from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms and most preferably from about 9 to about 15 carbon atoms.Although the source of the aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituent is not a critical aspect of the invention, this substituent will generally be derived from various olefinic monomers such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, hexene, octene, eocene, etc., including the oligomers, prepolymers and low molecular weight polymers formed from the foregoing monomers. Thus dimers, trimers and or tetramers of propylene and butylene can be used. The aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituted succinic acylating agents, component A , are the preferred acylating agents for use in preparing the additive compositions of this invention. They are well known and can be prepared by known procedures. One particularly useful procedure is to react a monoolefin monomer or oligomer as described above with maleic anhydride at 1000C to 2000C with or without a catalyst to form the corresponding substituted succinic anhydride. The monoolefin can be unsaturated in the alpha position such as in l butene, l hexene, l octene and l decene, or in a medial position such as in 2 butene, 3 pentene, 4 octene and the like. The same is true of the oligomers. The monoolefin also can be replaced by an alkyl halide which is capable of being subsituted onto the unsaturated anhydride or the equivalent free acid thereof. The aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituent can be saturated or unsaturated, straight chain or branched chain and may contain polar groups provided, however, that such groups are not present in significantly large proportions as to alter the hydrocarbon character of the substituent.Polar groups are typified by halo, carbonyl, nitro and similar groups. The imidazolines, component B , that can be employed to prepare the additive compositions of this invention are represented by the formulaEMI6.1 where Rt is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and hydrocarbon based radicals and R is an aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbon based radical. In a preferred embodiment R is a straight chain or branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbon based radical substituted with OH or NH2 groups, preferably OH groups, and containing from 1 to 6 and preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms and R will contain from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms.The most preferred imidazoline is the one where R is 2 hydroxyethyl radical and R is 2 heptadecenyl radical. Non limiting examples of other useful imidazolines include 2 heptadecenyl l 4hydroxybutylimidazoline 2 dodecyl l 5 hydroxypentylimidazoline 2 3 cyclohexylpropyl 1 2 hydroxyethylimidazo line 2 dodecylcyclohexyl 1 2 hydroxyethylimidazo1ine 2 heptadecenyl l butylimidazoline 2 tridecyl 1 2 amino ethylimidazoline 2 heptadecenyl 1 2 aminoethylimidazo line and the like. The above imidazolines can be prepared by methods such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,267,965 and U.S.Pat. No, 2,214,152. Generally the imidazolines of the above formula are readily formed by reacting an aliphatic or alicyclic carboxylic acid with an appropriate unsubstituted or hydrocarbon based radical substituted ethylene diamine.The reaction involves condensation of the acid with the diamine, at a temperature ranging from about 1100C to about 3500C, with the elimination of 2 moles of water. The reaction is represented by the following equationEMI7.1 where R and R have the same meaning as in the formula above. The aliphatic or alicyclic carboxylic acid may be saturated or unsaturated and may contain substituents such as halo, ether, sulfide, keto, hydroxyl, etc., as well as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, chlorophenyl, hydroxyphenyl, naphthyl, methyl naphthyl, etc. Representative, but non limiting examples of acids useful for the preparation of the imidazolines adapted for the purposes of this invention include undecanoic, myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic, ricinoleic, behenolic, stearolic phenylstearic, xylylstearic, chlorostearic, hydroxyphenylstearic, arachidic, tricosanoic, triacontanoic and dimer acids and the like. Mixtures of any of the foregoing acids are likewise useful. The additive compositions of the present invention may be readily prepared by heating mixtures of the unsubstituted or aliphatic hydrocarbon based substituted succinic acylating agent, component A , with the imidazoline, component B , at elevated temperatures ranging from about 30 C. to about 2500C. A more preferred range of reaction temperatures is from about 100 C. to about 2000C. particularly where it is preferred that the desired additive composition be of the ester salt, ester amide, amide salt or imide type. Below about 800C. the additive compositions are believed to be predominately salts or mixed salts esters.Above about 800C. the ester salt, ester amide, amide salt and imide types of structures are believed to predominate. The molar ratio of component A to component B in the mixture of reactants can range from about 1.0 0.5 to about 1.0 3.0. The preferred molar ratio ranges from about 1,01.0 to about 1.0 2.0. The additive compositions of this invention can be prepared either in the absence or presence of a solvent.Preferably the additive compositions of this invention are prepared in the presence of a solvent. Solvents suitable for use in the reaction may be hydrocarbon or polar solvents such as, for example, benzene, naphtha, toluene, xylene, nhexane, dioxane, chlorobenzene, kerosene, gasoline or a fuel oil and oil of lubricating viscosity. The exact chemical constitution of the additive compositions of this invention are not known with certainty although from the nature of the starting reactants used and the reaction conditions employed salts, mixed salts esters, ester amide, amide salt and imide type compositions and mixtures thereof are believed to be obtained.

Unrefined, refined and rerefined oils can be used in the lubricants of the present invention. Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source without further purification treatment. For example, a shale oil obtained directly from retorting operations, a petroleum oil obtained directly from distillation or ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process and used without further treatment would be an unrefined oil.Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Many such purification techniques, such as distillation, solvent extraction, acid or base extraction, filtration and percolation are known to those skilled in the art. Rerefined oils are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils applied to refined oils which have been already used in service. Such rerefined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils and often are additionally processed by techniques for removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products. Generally, the lubricants of the present invention contain an amount of the additive compositions of this invention sufficient to provide it with anti corrosion and dispersant properties. Normally this amount will be about 0.05 percent to about 10.0 percent by weight and preferably from about 0.1 percent to about 5.0 percent by weight of the additive compositions of this invention.
