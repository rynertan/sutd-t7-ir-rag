# A MOUTHPIECE APPARATUS FOR A PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTER

## Abstract
A mouthpiece apparatus for a pulmonary function tester, e.g., a spirometer, has a housing with a woven fabric diaphragm positioned across a passage through the hous ing. The woven fabric diaphragm provides a known differen tial pressure as a function of air flow, which is substantially the same from unit to unit. A port, capable of being connected to a pressure transducer, is in fluid communica tion with the passage, and the woven fabric resistance is located downstream of the port. The material used for the woven resistance element is one that is resistant to absorp tion of moisture and is formed as a monofilament.
