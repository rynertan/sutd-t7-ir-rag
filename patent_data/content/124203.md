# APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING THE DATA TRANSMISSION RATE IN A TELEMETRY SYSTEM

## Abstract
The data transmission rate in a cable telemetry system is improved by preconditioning an encoded data signal prior to discriminating and decoding it with a filter amplifier 15 employing an operational amplifier 20 having a nonin verting input connected to receive the data signal, an invert ing input which is grounded through a series connected re sistance R₁ and capacitance C₁ and an output which is feed back connected to said inverting input by a resistance R₂.
