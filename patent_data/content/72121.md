This invention further relates to processes for their preparation and to compositions containing them. These derivatives are of use in the treatment of bacterial infection. European Patent Application Publication No.0024832 discloses inter alia compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a group selected from OH, OS03H or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a methyl or ethyl ester thereof, OR3, Sir4, OCOR3, OC02R or OCONHR4 where R3 is a C14 alkyl group or a benzyl group and R4 is a C1 4 alkyl, benzyl, phenyl or p nitrobenzyl group andR2 is C1 4alkyl, C1 4alkyl substituted by a phenyl group optionally substituted by a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom or a methoxy, nitro, amino, acetamido or p nitrobenzylcarbonylamino group a C24 alkyl group substituted on other than the a carbon atom by an amino, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino, hydroxy, pnitrobenzyloxycarbonyloxy, methoxy, acetoxy or C14 alkyloxycarbonyl group a C1 4acyl group or a benzoyl, phenylacetyl or phenoxyacetyl group or a CH CHC02H group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof. We have now found that compounds within formula I having R1 equal to hydroxy and R2 being an amidino C16 alkyl ester of SCH CHC02H show superior efficacy for example antibacterial activity and or stability than related compounds specifically disclosed in the aforementioned European Patent Application. The present invention relates to amidine derivatives of an amine compound of the formula II EMI2.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, wherein X is a C1 6 alkanediyl moiety.
