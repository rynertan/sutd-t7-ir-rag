# Novel N,N bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl oxamides, chemiluminescent compositions containing them and processes for generating chemiluminescence employing said compositions.

## Abstract
Novel N,N bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl oxamides of the formula I CF₃ SO₂ CO CO SO₂ CF₃ I wherein R and R have the meaning given in the descrip tion preferably chlorinated phenyl or pyridyl, nitrophenyl or methoxyethyl , when used in compositions comprising also an organic fluorescer such as 1 chloro 9,10 bis phe nylethynyl anthracene and a diluent such as dibutyl phtha late, will furnish chemiluminescent light with good light intensity and quantum efficiency upon reaction with a peroxide component such as hydrogen paroxide. The pre paration of the compounds of the formula I is described e.g. the particulary preferred compound N,N bis 2,4.5 trichlorophenyl N,N bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl oxamide is prepared on the following way
