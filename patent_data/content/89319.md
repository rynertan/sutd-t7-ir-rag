## Description
SYNTHETIC CALCIUM VANADIUM FERRiMAGNETIC GARNETS WITH IMPROVEDHYSTERESIS CHARACTERISTICS IN TEMPERATURE . DESCRIPTIONThe present invention regards a class of compounds of great inte rest for application in the microwave field, and in particular, it deals with synthetic Calcium Vanadium ferrimagnetic garnets whose hysteresis properties with temperature are improved by means of suitable doping with Cobalt. Synthetic yttrium iron garnets with rare earths doping are the most important ferrimagnetic materials used for microwave compo nents. However the increasing cost of Yttrium and rare earths has soli citated the search for more economical substitutes. In this li ne the garnets of the Calcium Manadium system are of particular interest. These, thanks to the partial or total substitution of Yttrium or of the rare earths, allow the use of less expensive raw materials, at the same time maintaining good microwave cha racteristics, which are evidenced mainly in the field of magne tic losses. Up until now, an inconvenience has nevertheless excluded the use of these garnets from the important class of microwave devices such as phase shifters and circulators, opera ting on remanence that is the poor hysteresis characteristics. In particular the remanent magnetisation 4 Mr as a function of temperature is poor also for those Calcium Vanadium garnets containing gadolinium, which though present a satisfying tempera ture behaviour of the saturation magnetisation 4 14r M . The s temperature behaviour of the remanent magnetisation 4 Mr is related to the ratio between the anisotropy energy and magnetostriction energy H.P.T. Wijn et aL Philips Tech. Rev. 16,49 1954 . When this ratio is low the hysteresis cycle is poor, and this is normally the case of the synthetic Calcium Vanadium garnets. The present invention eliminates the above mentioned inconvenience by proposing a set of compounds based upon the in troduction into the basic structure of Cobalt ions.The Cobalt, acting with a mechanism called at single ion G.F.Dionne T. Appl. Phys. 40 4 ,486 1969 , is capable of altering the cited ratio between anisotropy energy and magnetostriction energy.We have found the Cobalt doping levels at which this beneficial effect is evidenced in the hysteresis loop, without simultaneous degradation of the other microwave characteristics.The materials obtained by us, with saturation magnetisation 4 Ms between 400 and 800 gauss at ambient temperature, have the general formulae Y Ca Gd Fe In V Co O 3 2x 2z 2x z 5 x y c y x c 12 with 0.4 x 1 0.25 y 0.75 0 z 2 0 c 0.1 The raw materials are high purity fine grain oxides and carbona tes. Mixed in the ratio indicated above the powders are then cal cined and sintered at temperatures between 800 and 14000 C to obtain the development of the formation reactions of the Ferrimagnetic garnet phase and its densification. The pressing of the calcined powders can be carried out by a hydraulic or isostatic method. As a purely illustrative example and not as a limitation of the practi hlity of the compound, subject of this invention, we cite figure 1 in which is indicated the noticeable improvement of the remanent magnetization 4 Mr stability in a large tempera ture range, obtained on a garnet with saturation magnetization 41t M of 680 Gauss at ambient temperature. sWith the materials obtained in this way numerous applications are possible, especially microwave devices operating at remanence, for which one requires simultaneously moderate costs, high temperature stability and low losses, such as circulators, commutators and phase shifters.
