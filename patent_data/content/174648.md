# Data processing method for correlating P and S wave seismic traces.

## Abstract
A method of processing seismic data enables correlation of P and S wave seismic traces. First, P and S waves are transmitted into the subsurface. The two way vertical travel times are then measured for each wave to different depths so as to yield two sets of time depths pairs. Mathematical functions relating two way vertical travel time, T
