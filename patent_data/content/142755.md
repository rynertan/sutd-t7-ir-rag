# LOW FRICTION BED PAD

## Abstract
A bed pad structure is provided for the prevention of bed sores or pressure ulcers. The bed pad includes a pouch por tion having an upper layer formed from a porous low friction material and a lower layer formed from a flexible impervious sheet material. The pouch portion is further constructed to enable easy insertion and removal of a lubricated insert in between the upper and lower layers. Lubrication from the insert can flow through the porous upper layer. The low fric tion characteristics of the upper layer plus the presence of the lubricant adjacent the patient substantially prevents friction and related wear which are contributing factor to the occurr ence of bed sores.
