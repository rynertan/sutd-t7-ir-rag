## Description
PRODUCTION OF AROMATIC SULFONYL CHLORIDES CONTAININGA QUINONEDIAZIDO GROUP The present invention relates to a process for producing an aromatic sulfonyl chloride containing a quinonediazido group by reacting an aromatic sulfonic acid containing a quinonediazido group or its salt with phosgene in the presence of a catalyst. It is well known that an aromatic sulfonyl chloride having a quinonediazido group hereinafter referred to as quinonediazide sulfonyl chloride is useful as an intermediate for use in preparation of organic industrial chemicals such as those used in photography, printing, dyes, and liquid crystals. With the recent marked advances in photography, printing, and electronics, quinonediazide sulfonyl chlorides have received increasing attention particularly as intermediates for producing light sensitive agents utilizing their reactivity to light. Heretofore, the quinonediazide sulfonyl chloride has been prepared from a quinonediazidesulfonic acid by techniques such as a method in which the quinonediazidesulfonic acid is reacted with a great excess of chlorosulfonic acid, and a method in which the quinonediazidesulfonic acid is reacted with chlorine in the presence of chlorosulfonic acid or anhydrous sulfuric acid, see for example West German Patents 146,573 and 246,574. These known methods, however, suffer from several disadvantages. One is that since equilibrium exists between the starting quinonediazidesulfonic acid and the reaction product quinonediazide sulfonyl chloride it is necessary to add chlorosulfonic acid in a great excess such as about 10 to 20 molar times theoretical if the yield of the product is to be increaded. Even so, the yield of the quinonediazide sulfonyl chloride is at most about 80 . Another disadvantage is that for removal of the unreacted starting material, a complicated procedure is required and, furthermore, a long reaction time is needed, which is undesirable. In industrial practice, therefore, these known methods cannot be said to be advantageous. An aim of the present invention is to overcome the above defects and to provide a process for the efficient production of the quinonediazide sulfonyl chloride. .According to the present invention there is provided a process for producing a sulfonyl chloride represented by the formula II Ri Ar SO2Cl j II by reacting a sulfonic acid or its salt represented by the formula I Ri Ar SO3M j I with phosgene in the presence of a catalyst and in the presence or absence of a solvent. In the above formulae I and II , R, which may be the same or different, is a monovalent substituent selected from a halogen atom, a nitro group, and an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms Ar is an organic group of the quinonediazide structure which is substituted by at least one oxy anion and at least one diazonium cation M is a hydrogen atom, a mono , di or trivalent metal, or an organic amino cation i is an integer of O to 5 and i is an integer of 1 to 5. Examples of the sulfonic acid or its salt of the formula I which can be used in the invention are aromatic sulfonic acids or their salts having a quinonediazido group, represented by the following formulae III , it , and V EMI4.1 EMI5.1 In the above formulae III , IV and V , R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, are each an aromatic fused ring residue represented by C C C C , a monovalent substituent represented by S03M, or a monovalent substituent represented by X, in which X, which may be the same or different,. is a monovalent substituted selected from a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a nitro group, and an alkyl group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms M is the same as defined above and a, b, c, m, n and E are each 0 or a positive integer satisfying the relations that a m 2, b n 4, and c p 4, provided that at least one S03M group is contained in the formula.

In particular, 1,2 benzoquinonediazide 4sulfonic acid, 1,2 benzoquinonediazide 5 sulfonic acid, 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 4 sulfonic acid, 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonic acid, 1 , 2 naphthoquinone diazide 6 sulfonic acid, 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 7 sulfonic acid, 2,1 naphthoquinonediazide 4 sulfonic acid, 2,1 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonic acid, 2,1 naphthoquinonediazide 6 sulfonic acid, and 2,1 naphthoquinone diazide 7 sulfonic acid and their sodium, potassium, calcium, or barium salts are preferably used. Especially preferred are 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonic acid and 2,1 naphthoquinonediazide 4 sulfonic acid, and their sodium, potassium, calcium, or barium salts. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the above starting material, quinonediazidesulfonic acid or its salt is reacted with phosgene to prepare the corresponding sulfonyl chloride. In practice of the process of the present invention, as the phosgene, pure phosgene or industrial phosgene can be used. The amount of phosgene used is usually at least 1 mole, preferably from about 1 to 2 moles, per equivalent of the sulfonic acid group present in the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof. If the amount of phosgene used is less than 1 mole, the reaction is not completed and the starting material remains unreacted. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 2 moles, side reactions ascribable to the quinonediazide group occur, causing a reduction in yield. Any catalysts can be used in the present invention as long as they are commonly used in sulfonyl chlorination of the sulfonic acid group. In general, acid amides, particularly lower aliphatic amides such as N,N dialkylcarboxylic acid amides e.g., N,N dimethylformamide and N,N diethylformamide , and polymers having these acid amides in the side chain are used. Among them, N,N dimethylformamide and N,N diethylformamide are preferably used, with N,N dimethylformamide being particularly preferred. The amount of the catalyst used is generally at least 0.01 mole, preferably at least 0.05 mole, and particularly preferably at least 0.2 mole, per equivalent of the sulfonic acid group present in the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof. Since the catalyst used in the present invention can act also as a solvent, there is no special limitation with respect to the upper limit of the amount used. The sulfonyl chlorination reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a solvent but can be performed even in the absence of a solvent. Examples of solvents which can be used include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, monochlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, hexane, n heptane, n octane, methylcyclohexane, 2 methylhexane, 2,3 dimethylpentane, ethylcyclohexane, cyclooctane, n nonane, isooctane, n decane, and ndodecane ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran esters such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate acid amides such as dimethylformamide and diethylformamide halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, 1 ,2 dichloroethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 1,1,2trichloro 2 fluoroethane, 1,1,2 tribromoethane, 1,1,2trichloropropane, 1,2 dichloropropane, and carbon tetrachloride nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile nitro compounds such as nitromethane, nitroethane, and nitrobenzene and mineral acids such as chlorosulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid. These solvents can be used singly or in combination with each other.From viewpoints of solubility and yield of the formed sulfonyl chloride, it is preferred that lower halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, and tetrachloroethylene be used singly. In order to increase the solubility of the reaction reagents in the solvent, it is preferred to add polar solvents such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, tetramethyl urea, dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, nitromethane, tetrahydrofuran, alkoxybenzenesulfonyl chlorides, benzenesulfonyl chloride, and phthalic chloride. In the sulfonyl chlorination reaction, stability and reactivity vary to a certain extent depending on the type of the starting material. Also, the reactivity varies with the type and amount of the catalyst, the type of the solvent, and other reaction conditions. But the reaction temperature is usually from 30 to 1000C, preferably from 20 to 60 C. If the reaction temperature exceeds 100 C, decomposition of the catalyst and quinonediazido group occurs, undesirably resulting in a decrease in yield. On the other hand, if it is below 300C, the rate of reaction is undesirably low. The reaction can be performed under either elevated pressure or reduced pressure. Usually it is performed under around atmospheric pressure. The sulfonyl chlorination reaction of the present invention can be performed continuously, semi continuously, or batchwise.In the case that the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof contains water, it can be dehydrated in advance with phosgene in the presence of the catalyst, and such is rather desirable. In the sulfonyl chlorination reaction of the present invention, it is important that phosgene be continuously supplied to a mixture prepared by mixing in advance the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof and the catalyst and, if desired, the solvent at a rate suitable for the reactivity for sulfonyl chlorination of the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof. If the rate of introduction of phosgene is too high as compared with the reactivity of the starting material, or if the catalyst is added in advance to a mixture of the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof and phosgene, side reactions are caused between the starting phosgene or an intermediate formed from the starting phosgene and the catalyst and the quinonediazido group, resulting in a decrease of yield.The reactivity for sulfonyl chlorination varies with the type of the starting sulfonic acid or salt thereof, the type and amount of the catalyst, and other conditions such as the use of the solvent and reaction temperature. Thus, taking into consideration these conditions, a. suitable phosgene introduction rate may be chosen. After the sulfonyl chlorination reaction is completed, if desired, unreacted phosgene and hydrochloric acid formed as a by product are separated from the reaction product by techniques such as a degassing treatment e.g.,.an evacuation method, a method of passing an inert gas such as nitrogen, and a combination thereof , or a water washing treatment. The sulfonyl chlorination reaction product freed of the unreacted phosgene and by product hydrochloric acid by the method as described above is subjected to a separation treatment such as distillation or precipitation under reduced or atmospheric pressure, to thereby remove the solvent.There is thus recovered the desired sulfonyl chloride from the sulfonyl chloride reaction product. The above precipitation treatment is achieved by introducing the reaction product into a solvent in which the sulfonyl chloride is sparingly soluble, such as ice water, benzene, and hexane. In general, there is employed a method in which solids resulting from so called recrystallization are filtered and separated. The thus obtained sulfonyl chloride can be used directly or after a purification treatment such as recrystallization, in preparation of organic industrial chemicals such as those used as an intermediate for light sensitive materials in photography or printing, dyes, or liquid crystals as well as an intermediate starting material for the preparation of photoresists. In accordance with the process of the present invention, a sulfonyl chloride of the formula II , Ri Ar S02CQ j can be prepared from a sulfonic acid or its salt of the formula I , Ri Ar S03M j and phosgene in a high yield. Further, since the reaction is completed using almost theoretical amounts of reaction reagents, it is not necessary to remove an excess of unreacted reaction reagent remaining after completion of the reaction as in conventional methods, and the reaction operation is simplified. Thus the present invention can give rise to various advantages on an industrial scale. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following Examples, although it is not intended to be limited thereby. EXAMPLE 1 Into a mixture of 98 parts by weight of sodium 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonate, 1,428 parts by weight of 1,2 dichloroethane, and 111 parts by weight ofN,N dimethylformamide was blown 43 parts by weight 1.2 times the reaction equivalent of phosgene over 2 hours and 52 minutes with stirring while maintaining the temperature of the mixture at O to 250C, to thereby achieve sulfonyl chlorination reaction. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was washed four times with 271 parts by weight of ice water. The solvent, 1,2 dichloroethane, was distilled away under reduced pressure at room temperature. The residue was dried under reduced pressure at room temperature, whereupon 90 parts by weight of 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5sulfonyl chloride purity, 98.8 was obtained.The percent yield in relation to the reaction reagent, sodium 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonate, was 92 .

After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled to 200C and poured into 8,400 parts by weight of ice water with stirring.Precipitate formed was filtered off, washed many times with water in a total amount of 12,000 parts by weight, and then dried under reduced pressure at room temperature. Thus, there was obtained 83.1 parts by weight of 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonyl chloride purity, 91.2 . The percent yield in relation to the reaction reagent, sodium 1,2 naphthoquinonediazide 5 sulfonate, was 78 . COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 98 parts by weight of sodium.2,1 naphtho quinonediazide 4 sulfonate was mixed with 128 parts by weight of 70 fuming sulfuric acid at a temperature not more than 20 CC. The mixture was heated to 500C, and 45 parts by weight of chlorine was blown thereinto for 4 hours while stirring to achieve sulfonyl chlorination. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was cooled to 200C and then poured into 1,000 parts by weight of ice water while stirring. Precipitate formed was filtered off, washed many times with water in a total amount of 5,000 parts by weight, and then dried under reduced pressure at room temperature. Thus, there was obtained 85 parts by weight of sodium 2,1 naphth6 quinonediazide 4 sulfonate purity, 85.8 . The percent yield in relation to the reaction reagent, sodium 2,1naphthoquinonediazide 4 sulfonate, was 75 .
