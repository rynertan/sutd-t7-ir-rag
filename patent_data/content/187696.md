# FULL DUPLEX CONFERENCING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A full duplex conferencing system providing hands free, unswitched continuously acting communication paths be tween one or more local participants and a communications network. The voice of each local participant is sensed through one or more microphones at the local conference, and applied to the communication network. Signals trans mitted to the network as well as those received from it are transmitted as pulsed infrared to each local participant. Each local participant wears an infrared receiver and earphone which permits that participant to hear the entire conversation without any switching interruptions. A keyboard and dialer permit direct dialing from the system over the network and a muting control disables the audio circuitry during dialing. A local ringer respnds to network ring signals to provide an audible ring to attract the user s attention for incoming calls.
