# Polyethylene blend and film.

## Abstract
A blend having improved optical and good mechanical properties comprising A at least 75 weight , preferably 85 95 weight , of ethylene hydrocarbon copolymer LLDPE of density 0.916 to 0.930 manufactured by the transition metal catalysed gas fluidised bed process and B not less than 1 weight , of low density polyethylene or ethylene copolymer made by the free radical catalysed high pressure process. The LLDPE A is preferably ethylene butene 1 or ethylene hexene 1 copolymer. The high pressure polymer B is preferably an autoclave LDPE having a high die swell ratio and a MIR below 50.
