# Method of manufacturing poly V pulleys and the products.

## Abstract
The present application discloses improvements in a method of manufacturing poly V pulleys and the products. According to the method of the present invention, after the cylindrical peripheral wall of a cup shape blank 4 produced by drawing a metal plate has been thickened, V shape grooves having improved precision are formed with a V shape groove forming roller 17 and an inner groove forming rotary mold 15 being simultaneously applied respectively to the outer and inner peripheral surfaces of the cylindrical peripheral wall 4a . The V shape groove forming roller includes a rolling face having a plurality of parallel V shape crests divided by steep valleys 17a . The inner groove forming rotary mold has annular V shape projections in the peripheral direction of the mold at the positions corresponding to the valleys of the forming roller.
