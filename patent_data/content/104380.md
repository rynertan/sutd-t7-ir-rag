# Iron boron solid solution alloys having high saturation magnetization and low magnetostriction.

## Abstract
Ferromagnetic substitutional solid solution alloys char acterized by high saturation magnetization, low or near zero magnetostriction and having a bcc structure are provided. The alloys consist essentially of about 1 to 9 atom percent boron, balance essentially iron plus incidental impurities.
