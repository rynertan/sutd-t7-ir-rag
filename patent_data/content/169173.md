# Expansion plug of improved type.

## Abstract
An expansion plug comprises a tubular element 1 provided with a longitudinal slot 2 and having a hollow in terior with a substantially rectangular cross section with generally parallel major sides, and a generally rod shape support member 8 a shank 6 of which is co operatively engageable in the interior of the tubular element 1 and having substantially the same cross sectional shape as that of the said interior of the tubular element 1 and having a screw thread or suitable grooves formed on the smaller sides.

## Claims
Claims 1. An improved expansion plug characterised by the fact that it comprises a tubular element 1 provided with a longitudinal slot 2 and having a hollow interior with a substantially rectangular cross section with generally parallel major sides, and a generally rod shape support member 8 a shank 6 of which is co operatively engageable in the interior of the tubular element 1 and having substantially the same cross sectional shape as that of the said interior of the tubular element 1 and having a screw thread or suitable grooves formed on the smaller sides thereof. 2. An improved expansion plug as in the preceding Claim, characterised by the fact that the said tubular element 1 , has, at one end, a projecting thrust collar 3 against uhich engages a fixing sleeve 4 provided, possibly, with a flanged portion 5 . 3. An improved expansion plug as in one or more of the preceding Claims, characterised by the fact that the major sides of the interior cross section of the said tubular element 1 are disposed in such a way that the said longitudinal slot 2 opens in correspondence with the central portion of one of the minor sides of the cross section. 4. An improved expansion plug as in one or more of the preceding Claims, characterised by the fact that the said shank 6 of the said rod like support member 8 is formed to a generally rectangular shape by means of a suitable removal of material along two of its diametrically opposed portions.

## Description
Expansion Plug of Improved Type The present invention relates to an expansion plug of improved type.As is known, to fix hooks or supports to a wall, expansion plugs are usually utilised.It is likewise known that these latter are formed substantially by a small tube which is introduced into a hole of suitable diameter preliminarily formed in the wall this tube is then deformed in a radial sense by means of the insertion and screwing into its interior of a screw or a threaded shank.In particular, for a correct fixation of the hook or support, the threaded part of these must be screwed to the bottom of the deformable plug, with an operation which obviously requires a certain consumption of time.An equal consumption of time is likewise required whenever it is intended to remove the said elements from these plugs.The object of the present invention is that of eliminating the inconveniences complained of above providing an improved expansion plug by means of which a hook or support can be fixed to a wall by means of a partial rotation of its shank.Within the scope of the above mentioned object, a particular object of the present invention is that of providing an improved expansion plug which is structurally and constructionally simple and, therefore, of restricted cost.Another subject of the present invention is that of providing an improved expansion plug which is easy to use and reliably secure.The said object, as well as the above listed objects and others which will possibly become apparent hereinbelow are achieved by an improved expansion plug characterised by the fact that it comprises a tubular element provided with a longitudinal slot and having a hollow interior with a substantially rectangular cross section with generally parallel major sides, and a generally rod shape support member a shank of which is cooperatively engageable in the interior of the tubular element and having substantially the same cross sectional shape as that of the said interior of the tubular element and having a screw thread or suitable grooves formed on the smaller sides thereof. Further characteristics and advantages of the improved expansion plug which constitutes the subject of the present utility model will be better understood with the aid of the following description and the various figures of the attached drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two support members provided, respectively, with a curved end in the form of a hook and a threaded end, which have a shank having an oblong transverse section Figure 3 is a view of the tubular element with which the said members co operate Figure 4 is a transverse section of such a tubular element Figures 5 and 6 are perspective views of a portion of one of the said support members, with a schematic indication of the manner of operation for fixing it to the interior of the said tubular element and Figures 7, 8 and 9 show the same fixing member, as is indicated in Figure 1, but with, respectively, a hook end, a cylindrical head, and a polygonal head.With particular reference now to the various figures of the attached drawings, the improved expansion plug in question comprises a tubular element 1 provided with a longitudinal slot 2 having, close to one end, a projecting thrust collar 3 against which engages a fixing sleeve 4 provided, ash shown, with a flanged portion 5.In particular this tubular element has a generally rectangular internal section with parallel major sides disposed in such a way that the said longitudingal slot 2 opens along the central portion of one of the minor sides.With the said tubular element co operates a threaded shank 6 which is also made generally rectangular by means of a suitable removal from a round bar, of material along two diametrically opposite portions 7.In practice, by inserting this shank to the bottom of the tubular element and rotating it by one quarter of a revolution, a stable fixing between the two pieces themselves is obtained.This operation, in fact, as well as performing a compression action of the all of the tubular element against the wall of the hole in which it is inserted is also able to cause a self threading of the internal wall of the tubular element itself. Obviously, the said threaded and worked shank can constitute the end portion of a round bar 8, which may be curved at the other end in the form of a hook, or provided with a cylindrical or hexagonal head or the like, or can be constituted by a suitably threaded bar 8 .From what has been explained above and from observation of the various figures of the attached drawings, the great functionality and practicality in use which characterises the improved expansion plug constituting the subject of the present utility model will be evident. In particular, as shown in the drawings, the smaller sides of the generally rectangular cross section of both the interior of the tube and the shank of the insert may be rounded to facilitate turning the shank within the tube.
