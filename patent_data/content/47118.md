# Vacuum filtration of clay slurries.

## Abstract
Hydrolysed polyacrylamides are used as flocculants in the vacuum filtration of clay slurries. From 0.1 to 0.25 Kg of a hydrolysed polyacrylamide is added per dry tonne of Kaolin clay.

## Claims
CLAIM A process for dewatering Kaolin clay slurries by vacuum filtration which comprises adding to the slurry from 0.1 to 0.25 Kg per dry tonne of Kaolin clay of a hydrolysed polyacryl amide having a molecular weight of from 1.5 to 106 to 4.0 x 106.

## Description
VACUUM FILTRATION OF CLAY SLURRIES This application relates to a process for dewatering Kaolin clay. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved process for dewatering Kaolin clay slurries by using hydrolyzed polyacrylamides as flocculants in the vacuum filtration of such slurries. Kaolin clay is normally processed as a slurry which is dewatered on a vacuum filter.Heretofore, flocculants have not been used as dewatering aids because they adversely affected the viscosity of the resultant clay slip, thereby adversely affecting subsequent redispersion of the clay slip for shipment as a slurry and resultant use. It has now been discovered that Ã§hen a low to medinin molecular weight hydrolyzed polyacrylamide is used as a flocculant in the vacuum filtration of Kaolin clay slurries the cake dryness and yield from the vacuum filter is increased. As used herein, the term Kaolin clay means a white clay ased as a paper coating and filler, paint pigment or in the manufacture of ceramics, The low to medium molecular weight hydrolysed polyacrylamides useful in the practice of the present Invention have a molecular weight of from 1.5 x 106 to 4.0 x 106, when measure by low angle light scattering.By hydrolyzed polyacrylamide is meant a polyacrylamide ranging in hydrolysis from 5 to 30 percent, preferably between 15 and 25 percent, or a copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid containing 5 to 30 percent acrylic acid units. The polymers useful in the present invention lay be prepared by conventional polymerization processes. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, these polymers may be used at a dosage of 0.1 to 0.25 Eg. of polymer per dry tonne of Kaolin clay and nay be added to the slurp at any point prior to addition to the vacuum filters. This invention may be illustrated by the data set forth inTable I in which 3 to 4 liters of sludge is conditioned with polymer at the optimam dosage, as determined by the Fi lter LeafTest. The fabric covered filter leaf is immersed in the con ditioned smudge and the pressure on it reduced to half the ambient while the leaf is gently swirled through the sludge for 30 seconds.The leaf is removed from the bucket and quickly turned upright 180 while the vacuum is continued and the cake is allowed to Q Or for 90 seconds. After 90 seconds, the vacuum is shut off and the leaf turned sideways 900 to see if the cake will fall off the cloth. If it will not fall off, then it is scraped off in one continuous motion with a spatula and the following is noted a the ease or difficulty encountered in scraping the cake from the cloth b the amount of cake left on the cloth after scraping c cake thickness d cake dryness and e suspended solids in filtrate. The cloth is washed with a water spray and the above steps are repeated four times using a freshly conditioned sludge sample each time to indicate any tendency of the cloth to blind .
