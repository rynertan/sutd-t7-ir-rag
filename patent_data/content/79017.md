# A PACKING LAMINATE IN THE FORM OF A WEB AND A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
A packing laminate in the form of a web with thinned edge zones is manufactured by providing a wide raw material web simultaneously wih a number of parallel thinned areas. The raw material web is then covered with layers of thermoplastic material, whereupon it is divided into webs of the desired width by means of cuts placed asymmet rically in the said thickness reduced areas. As a result the finished laminate webs obtain thermoplastic covered, thick ness reduced edge zones of different widths.
