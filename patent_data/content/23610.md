# A modified polyamide imide resin and its use for preparing electrical insulation materials and shaped articles.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a polyamide imide resin hav ing carboxyl groups and modified with an N methylolated methacryl or acryl amide compound and, if desired, fur ther with a bismaleimide compound. The resin has improv ed properties over conventional polyamide imide resins. When the resin is used, for example in the form of a film or sheeting for printed circuit boards, the film or sheeting has improved heat resistance and enhanced flexural strength and is capable of withstanding soldering baths at high temperatures.
