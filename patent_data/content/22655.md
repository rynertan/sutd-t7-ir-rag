# Dental constructs and tools and production thereof.

## Abstract
A dental construct or tool characterised in that it comprises a glass ceramic having a mica as the predominant crystal phase is disclosed. A process for the production thereof characterised in that it comprises a melting a glass forming batch and optionally cooling to give a preform which is then remelted b shaping the melt to form a glass body having an intermediate configuration having at least one selected surface of particular conformation c heat treating the glass body to cause in situ crystallization and thereby convert it into a glass ceramic body of corresponding intermediate shape wherein a mica constitutes the predominant crystal phase and d forming selected surfaces of the glass ceramic body as desired to provide the dental construct or tool, is also disclosed. The present invention relates to superior materials which satisfy the various requirements for dental use and are convenient to work.
