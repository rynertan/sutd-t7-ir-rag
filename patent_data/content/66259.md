# TOOTHBRUSH STRUCTURE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a toothbrush structure compris ing a brush handle 1 and a bristle carrying head 7 , which latter is mounted to rock relatively to the brush handle 1 . This arrangement enables the friction of the bristles to be evenly distributed over the teeth, thereby the removal of the bacterial film from the teeth themselves is improved through automatic mutual fitting of the sliding movement planes. Also afforded is adequate protection against traumatic shocks of the gum groove, while different color heads and handles may be assembled, where desired.
