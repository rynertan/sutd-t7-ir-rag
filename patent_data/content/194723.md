# Variable reference voltage transmission amplifier in the form of a line voltage stabiliser.

## Abstract
Transmission amplifier which also stabilises the line d.c. voltage for the audio transmission circuit of a telephone set. Customary transmission amplifiers of this construction do not operate anymore when the line voltage decreases to below a threshold value because of external causes, for example when a non electronic set is arranged in parallel. By reducing, in accordance with the invention, the reference voltage for the line voltage stabilisation if the line d.c. voltage approaches the threshold value, the output stage of the transmission amplifier continues to conduct current, thus enabling the transmission amplifier to continue transmitting signals through the subscriber s line.

## Description
Variable reference voltage transmission amplifier in the form of a line voltage stabiliser The invention relates to a telephone set which is fed with line d.c. voltage via the subscriber s line, comprising a transmission amplifier which is in the form of a line voltage stabiliser and includes an input stage constituted by a fed back operational amplifier, the transmission amplifier comprising a circuit for producing a reference voltage for line voltage stabilisation, means for forminq the difference between the line d.c. voltage and The reference voltage, which difference voltage is applied to a first input of the operational amplifier, and means for producing an auxiliary voltage which linearly depends on the line direct current, the auxiliary voltage being applied to a second input of the operational amplifier. Such a telephone set is disclosed in the Article A Programmable Speech Circuit Suitable for Telephone Transducers IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC 17, No. 6, December 1982, pages 1149 1157, more specifically Figure 8. A telephone set connected to a subscriber s line of a public telephone network receives via this subscriber s line from the telephone exchange a line voltage formed by a d.c. voltage component, the line d.c. voltage and an a.c. voltage component. In addition the line d.c. voltage is m adulated by the signal to be transmitted by the telephone set. In the telephone set, the line d.c. voltage is set by a voltage stabiliser which may form part of the transmission amplifier.A transmission amplifier which at the same time constitutes a voltage stabiliser, as is also described in the a1x e mentioned IEEE article, controls the line d.c. voltage at the terminals of the telephone set in such a manner that this line d.c. voltage is formed by a first constant voltage portion on which a second portion which is proportional to the line direct current is superposed.Such a control is accomplished in that the fed back operational amplifier controls its output such that the voltages at its two inputs are substantially equal. Consequently, said difference voltage is kept equal to said auxiliary voltage. If by some cause or another the telephone set were supplied with a line d.c. voltage lower than the first constant voltage portion, then no current flows anymore through the output stage of the transmission airplifier, as a result of which the transmission amplifier would not be capable anymore of transmitting signals through the subscriber s line. Such a situation nay occur if a second, conventional telephone set without electronic line voltage stabiliser is switched in parallel with a telephone set including an electronic line voltage stabiliser. The current voltage characteristic for direct current of such a conventional telephone set is generally the current voltage characteristic of an ordinary ohmic resistance of, for example, 200 n . If this parallel arrangement of telephone sets is connected to a long subscriber s line, which, because of its high resistance, can only produce little line direct current for example 15 rtA , then a voltage for example 3 V which is lower than the constant portion for exairple 4 V of the line d.c. voltage to be adjusted by the electronic set may be produced across the conventional set. The invention has for its object to provide a telephone set of the type described in the opening paragraph, which even at low line d.c. voltage reins capable of applying a transmission signal to the subscriber s line. According to the invention, the telephone set is therefore characterized in that the transmission amplifier includes weans which reduce the reference voltage when the line d.c. voltage decreases to below a predetermined value Reducing the reference voltage accomplishes that the constant portion of the line d.c. voltage to be set by the telephone set is also reduced, as a result of which current still continues to flow through the output stage of the transmission amplifier even in the case a conventional telephone set is connected in parallel. An embodiment of the telephone set according to the invention includes a comparator circuit for controlling the circuit for producing the reference voltage for line voltage stabilisation.Also when the telephone set operates with a reduced line voltage, this comparator circuit, which is fed with this reduced line voltage, must continue to function. An embodiment of the telephone set according to the invention including a comparator circuit which also continues to function at low supply voltages, is characterized in that the comparator circuit is constituted by a current mirror to those input and output the collector of each of the transistors are connected, these two transistors together forming a differential stage having a common emitter lead in which a current source is provided, the output of this comparator being constituted by the output of the current mirror. The supply voltage of the comparator circuit of such a structure is equal to the sum of the voltages across the current mirror, across the collector emitter path of the differential stage and across the current source in the emitter lead. This sum voltage may amount at the very least to twice a transistor saturation voltage of 0.2 V plus a diode forward voltage of 0.7 V, so may be in the order of magnitude of 1.1 V. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying Figures, corresponding elements in the Figures being given the same reference numerals. Herein Figure 1 shows a prior art transmission amplifier which also functions as a line voltage stabiliser Figure 2 shows a current voltage characteristic of the circuit as shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a modification of the transmission amplifier of Figure 1 which is thus, according to the invention, suitable for low line voltages Figure 4 shows a different modification of the transmission amplifier of Figure 1, more specifically suitable for integration Figure 5 shows a first embodiment of an other transmission amplifier suitable for low line voltages Figure 6 shows a second embodiment of this other transmission amplifier Figure 7 shows an embodiment of a comparator circuit for use in the transmission amplifiers of Figures 3 to 6 Figure 8 shows a current voltage characteristic measured with the aid of a circuit as shown in Figure 4. The invention is applicable to both the transmission amplifier as disclosed in the said IEEE article and to the transmission amplifier as described in the European Patent Application, publication nvur bOr 0 154 366. Figure 1 shows said last transmission amplifier, which is also suitable for use as a line voltage stabiliser. This transmission amplifier has a pair of connection terminals 10 for connection to the subscriber s line via a conventional diode bridge, not shown, a fed back operational amplifier 12 functioning as an input stage of the transmission amplifier and a diode 14, from which the reference voltage for the line voltage stabilisation is derived. This diode is set in the forward direction by a current source, not shown in the Figures, causing the voltage across this diode to be equal to the diode forward voltage Vd of approximately 0.6 Volts. The transmission amplifier further includes an output stage formed by output transistor 16 with emitter resistor 18 of, for example, 20n r a voltage divider constituted by the resistors 20 and 22, and a capacitor 24. The circuit as shown in Figure 1 also includes a line terminating resistor 26 of, for example, 600 fl arranged in series with a supply capacitor 28 of, for example, 100 uF. As the fed back operational amplifier controls its output such that its two inputs have a substantially equal voltage, the voltage across resistor 20 is equal to the diode forward voltage Vd.The voltage across resistor 22 is then larger by a factor equal to the resistance ratio. This last rrentioned voltage across resistor 22 functions as a reference voltage for the line voltage stabilisation.Consequently, across the junction between the resistors 20 and 22 there is a voltage compared with the voltage at the lower line connection terminal which is chosen as the voltage reference which is equal to the difference between the line d.c voltage and the reference voltage as a result thereof this differential voltage is also present across the non inverting input of the amplifier 12. A voltage equal to the prcduct of the direct current through the output stage of the transmission amplifier and the resistance value of resistor 18 is present across resistor 18.Consequently a voltage equal to the sum of the voltage across resistor 18 and the diode forward voltage Vd is present at the inverting input of amplifier 12. Thus, the voltage at this input depends linearly on the line direct current. By equating the voltages at the inverting and the non inverting inputs of amplifier 12, a linear relationship between the direct current through the output stage of the transmission amplifier and the d.c. voltage thereacross is obtained. If no line direct current is required for, for example, feeding further electronic circuits, the the line direct current is equal to the direct current through the output stage of the transmission amplifier. The relationship between the line direct current and the line d.c. voltage is then illustrated by the straight line in Figure 2. In practical cases a portion of the line direct current is sometimes used for feeding other circuits it then varies as illustrated by the broken line portion of the characteristic of Figure 2.It is assumed that the overall line direct current flows through the output stage. The line d.c. voltage is formed by a constant portion VO of, for example, 4 V on which a portion proportional to the line direct current is superposed. If a telephone set having a characteristic as shown inFigure 2, is arranged in a long subscriber s line in parallel with a non electronic telephone set, then the current through the output transistor 16 will decrease to zero. Consequently, the transmission amplifier cannot send a signal to the subscriber s line anymore so that this set becomes inoperative. This is caused by the carparatively low direct current resistance of, for example, 200 Q of the nonmelectronic set.A long subscriber s line can only produce a limited line direct current, for example 15 m. Then a voltage having a value of 3 V is produced across the 200 Q resistance set which is not enough for adequate operation of the electronic set, the more so when the voltage drop across a diode bridge, not shown, is taken into consideration. In the most advantageous case whenSchottky diodes are used this voltage drop amounts to 0.8 V. Figure 3 shows a circuit with which the last mentioned problem can be solved in accordance with the invention. A number of the components already described with reference to Figure 1 can be integrated in an integrated circuit 30. The circuit further includes a current measuring resistor 32 of, for example, 120 Ohm, arranged in series with the collector of transistor 16. A capacitor 34 having a capacitance of, for example, 47 uF is arranged in parallel with resistor 32 for alternating current decoupling. A series arrangement of the main current path of a transistor 36 and a resistor 38 of, for example, 1 M Q is provided between the line connection terminals 10 this resistor is incorporated in the collector lead of transistor 36.The base of this transistor is connected to that side of resistor 32 which is connected to the collector of transistor 16 and the emitter is connected to the other side of resistor 32. A transistor 40 has its emitter connected to the emitter of transistor 36, its base to the collector of transistor 36 and its collector to the junction of the resistors 20 and 22, a resistor 42 also being connected to this junction the other side of this resistor is connected to the collector of transistor 16. The circuit shown in Figure 3 operates as follows. As soon as the current through resistor 32 exceeds a predetermined value, for example 5 nA, transistor 36 becomes conductive, as a result of which the collector voltage and the emitter voltage of this transistor differ only to a very little extent. Transistor 40 is then non conduc tive. If a larger current flows through the circuit via the subscriber s line, transistor 36 is driven to the saturated state and the greater part of the current flows to transistor 16 via the emitter base path of transistor 36. If the current through resistor 32 becorres less than 5 nA, , then transistor 36 changes to the non conducting stage. The collector voltage of this transistor decreases, causing transistor 40 to beccoe conductive. Current then flows to the junction of the resistors 20 and 22, as a result of which the voltage at this junction does s not decrease further. This results in a decrease in the reference voltage for the line voltage stabilisation i.e. the voltage across resistor 22 . Because of the fact that the reference voltage is influenced thus, a voltage having the value of the diode forward voltage is preserved across resistor 0, causing amplifier 12 to stay within its control range and as a result of which transistor 16 can continue to conduct current. A voltage of approximately 0.6 V is present across resistor 32, so that the voltage to be set by the line voltage stabilising circuit must be reduced by 0.6 V to ensure an unchanged voltage at the line connection terminals 10. This lower setting by the stabilising circuit is achieved by arranging a resistor 42 in parallel with resistor 22. Figure 4 shows an embodiment of the invention which is particularly suitable for implementation in integrated circuit techniques. In addition to the components already described this circuit arrangement includes a circuit 44 for applying current to the junction of the resistors 20 and 22. This circuit 44 is formed by a comparator 46, a controllable current source 48 and a circuit 50 for producing a comparator reference voltage, shown symbolically as a voltage source. Comparator 46 compares the comparator reference voltage with the voltage at the junction of the resistors 20 and 22. If this last mentioned voltage decreases to below the comparator reference voltage, current source 48 is driven such that it starts applying current to this junction. This causes the reference voltage for the line voltage stabilisation to decrease, as a result of which transistor 16 continues to conduct current. Also at low supply voltages to the order of magnitude of 1.1 V comparator 46 must continue operation to ensure the abovedescribed control. An erbodiment of such a comparator will be described in greater detail with reference to Figure 7. Figure 5 shows a transmission amplifier, which also functions as a line voltage stabiliser, as disclosed in said IEEE article, provided with additional components for use of the invention. The circuit shown in Figure 5 is comprised of an operational amplifier 12 to whose output an output stage is connected, formed by transistor 16 and the associated emitter resistor 8. The inverting input of amplifier 12 is connected to the emitter of transistor 16, the non inverting input is connected to one of the two line connection terminals 10 via a reference voltage source 52 and a resistor 54 arranged in series therewith. In addition, the non inverting input is connected to the other line connection terminal via a series arrangenent of a resistor 84 and a capacitor 86. These resistor 84 and capacitor 86 are used for determining the a.c. output impedance of the transmission amplifier. The reference voltage for the line voltage stabilisation is the voltage produced by voltage source 52, so that at the noninverting input of amplifier 12 the difference between the line d.c.voltage and the reference voltage is pplied. If the line d.c. voltage decreases to below the reference voltage, then amplifier 12 is driven to beyond its control range, so that transistor 16 d does s not conduct current anymore. So as to ensure that the circuit shown in Figure 5 continues operation even at a low line voltage, this circuit includes a comparator 56, a comparator reference source 60 and a controllable current source 58. If the difference between the line voltage and the voltage source 52 decreases to below the voltage of reference source 60, then current source 58 is driven by comparator 56 so that current is applied to that side of the resistor 54 connected to the noninverting input. Thus, the reference voltage produced by the series arrangement of voltage source 52 and resistor 54 is reduced, so that amplifier 12 stays within its control range. Figure 6 shows a variation of the eriboditrent of the invention shown in Figure 5. In Figure 6 the output of comparator 56 is directly connected to the reference voltage source 52. In a manner known per se this voltage source is constituted by a voltagecontrollable voltage source. By reducing the voltage of this voltage source 52 when the difference between the line d.c. voltage and the voltage of source 52 decreases to below the comparator reference voltage it is also accomplished that amplifier 12 stays within its control range. Figure 7 shows a circuit for applying current 44 for applying current to the junction of the resistors 20 and 22 as described more specifically with reference to Figure 4. This circuit is formed by a comparator 46, a circuit 50 for producing a comparator reference voltage, and a controllable current source 48. Comparator 46 is comprised of current mirror 62, which is formed by the transistor 64 and a diode 66, a differential stage formed by two transistors 68 and 70 and a current source 72 included in the common emitter lead. The collector of transistor 70 is connected to the signal input of current mirror 62, the collector of transistor 68 is connected to the signal output of this current mirror. This signal output also constitutes the output of comparator 46. A first input of comparator 46 is connected to comparator reference voltage circuit 50. This circuit 50 is formed by a series arrangement of, arranged one after the other, a current source 74, two diodes 76 and 78 and a resistor 80. The reference voltage is taken from the junction between current source 44 and diode 76. A controllable current source 58 which in this emDcdiment is constituted by a transistor, is connected to the output of comparator 46. The control input of this current source 48 is formed by the base of this transistor. The collector of this transistor, forming the output of current source 48, is connected to the other input of comparator 46. Because of this last mentioned connecting mode comparator 46 and current source 48 form a feedback system. The output 82 thus formed is connected to said junction of resistors 20 and 22. Figure 8 shows the relationship between the line direct current k and the line d.c. voltage V. This characteristic is treasured using the circuit of Figure 4. For voltages higher than 3.8 V this voltage is formed by a 3.6 V constant portion V , on which a portion proportional to the line current is superposed. For voltages less than 3.8 V it was found that the circuit still conducts current, so that the transmission amplifier is still capable of transmitting a signal through the subscriber s line.
