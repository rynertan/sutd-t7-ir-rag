# A method and an apparatus for producing warp free corrugated cardboard.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for the production of a warp free corrugated cardboard from a corrugating machine. In one aspect a method for producing warp free corru gated cardboard 17 is characterised in that a continuously running web of corrugated cardboard is induced with al ternate upward and downward warps by applying moisture alternately to the two liners 13, 16 of said corrugated card board for each length corresponding to a first predeter mined number of cut cardboard sheets, and subsequently, after said web of corrugated cardboard has been con tinuously cut into sheets having a predetermined cut length, a second predetermined number of said sheets are success ively stacked so that said induced warps may be reformed by the weight of the sheets themselves. Preferably, the se cond predetermined number should be chosen to be an integral multiple 2 or more multiple of the first predeter mined number. Another aspect of the invention resides in the apparatus for effecting the method of the invention.
