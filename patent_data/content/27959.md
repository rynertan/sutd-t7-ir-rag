# Battery charging system and method adapted for use in a sterilized environment.

## Abstract
A battery charger system suited for use in a sterilized environment such as an operating room includes a ste rilizable battery containing pack 16 adapted for connec tion to a non sterilized battery charger 12 through a sterilizable tray interface 14 . The tray interface 14 inclu des connecting structure 40 on an upper side for me chanical and electrical connection to at least one battery pack 16 and additional connecting structure 48 on a lower side for mechanical and electrical connection to the charger. The upper side and lower side electrical connec tions are inter connected to effect electrical coupling be tween the sterilized battery 16 and the non sterilized charger 12 so that the battery may be charged, dis charged, or tested. A sterilizable drape 32 is adapted to be constrained between the tray interface 14 and the charger 12 to isolate the charger from the sterilized environment. Encodable switch operating tabs 54 are provided on the tray interface 14 to automatically effect the desired operating mode of the charger 12 when the tray interface is connected to the charger, and indicating apertures 46 are provided through which the operating mode of the charger 12 can be determined.
