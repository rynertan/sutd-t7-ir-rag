## Description
S Adenosyl I methionine Active Methionine, indicat ed by the abbreviation SAM is one of the most important sulphur containing compounds from the biological viewpoint, in that it takes part to many enzymatic transmethylation reaction, as donor of methyl groups. From here its therapeutical indications derive in the treatment of arthroses, periarthritis and at cerebral level in depression syndromes. As the transmethylation reactions are of fundamental importance in the physiology of all living beings, active methionine is of extreme interest from the physiological and therapeutical veiw points. The more known methods for preparing such compound are of three types the enzymatic method see Cantoni, J. Bioc.Chem., 189 203 1951 ibid 189 745 1951 ibid 204 407 1953 Cantoni, J. Am. Them. Soc. 74.2942 1952 Japan. Patent 80 96,099 July 21st 1980 the chetnical method see Baddiley and Jamieson, J. Chem. Soc. 1955 p. 1085 Clifford H. Shunt et al., U.S. Patent 2 969353, Jan. 24th 1961 the biological method see Aminoacid, 4 95 98 1961 Japan J.B.C., 229 1037 1957 J. Biol. Chem, Tsuchida et al. U.S. Pat. 3,962,034 8th Jun 1976 . In the problem of formulating active methionine in the form of compositions suitable for pharmaceutical use various troubles have been met, mainly connected with the difficulty of obtaining compositions stable for long time periods and therefore suitable to any types and ways of administration. Up to date, no pharmaceutical forms sexist of this drug, suitable to be administered by the oral way on ly some SAM salts are known, with ions such as chloride, sulphate and p toluenesulphonate ions, some of which can be administered by the parenteral way, they being however so not very stable and so hygroscopic, that they necessarily require complex processes to the pur pose of being formulated, such as e.g., freeze drying processes. Purpose of the present invention is to prepare active methionine in the form of a stable non hygroscopic salt, suitable to be administered by any ways, and to be prepared without any particular problems in the form of the most commonly used pharmaceutical copositions. According to the purposes of the invention, such aSAM salt is gastroresistant insoluble in water, yet capable of forming SAM solutions, when being sdequate ly treated capable of releasing SAM in situ at the in testinal level capable of being prepared in the form of compositions with controlled release characteristics. According to a further purpose of the invention, such pharmaceutical composition is produced on industrial scale, in a simple and substantially cheap way. Another purpose of the invention is to be able to extract SAM from liquids containing it, by means of a low cost process, and obtaining high quality compositions. These and other purposes which will be described in the following disclosure, are achieved by the present invention by means of a salt of S adenosyl It methionine, and compositions containing it, preferably for pharmaceutical use, characterized in that it is a salt of an organic resin consisting of a polymer or of a copolymer with acidic functional groups. According to the invention, the resin hich is used to form the salt of SAM is a polymer or a copolymer with acidic functional characteristics, whose acidic functions can be partly or totally salified. Such resin is preferably, but not limitedly, cross linked. The acidic functions can be e.g. sulphonic, phos phonic, carboxyl, iminodiacetic, aminoacidic, and so on, groups. Non imitative examples of resins within the purpose of the present invention are polystyrenesulphonic copolymer crosslinked ion exchange resins of the styrene divinyl benzene type, with sulphonic functional groups ligninsulphonic copolymers and or polymers crosslinked or not crosslinked polymethacrylic acids crosslinked or not crosslinked polyacrylic acids crosslinked or not crosslinked polysulphonic acids and or carboxyl salts and or phosphonic salts and or iminodiacetic salts and or alkylphosphonic salts and or aikylsulphonic salts and or alkylarylsulphonic salts snd or aikylphosphonic salts membranes and filaments onto which acidic functional groups have been grafted halogenated and or partly halogenated polymers and or copolymers containing acidic functional groups. The acidic polymers or copolymers have a gel, or macroreticular or macro porous or isoporous structure. Let us consider e.g. the polystyrenesulphonic resin PS the molecular weight of this resin is higher than 100 DALTON, preferably higher than 1,000 and still more preferably, higher than 11000,000 DALTON. In the case Df polystyrenesulphonic copolymer, the crosslinking degree preferred is lower than 906 w w, preferably lower than 105S, and still more preferably lower than 6 . PS Polymer has preferably, but not limitedly, a gel structure with high porosity. In the case of polystyrenesulphonic polymer, the physical dimension of the copolymer used to prepareSAM salt is comprised within the range of from 10 mm to 0.001it, preferably of from 1,000 to 11t, and still more preferably, of from 500 to 20cm. The characteristic moisture content of the polymer is higher than 0,5 of its weight preferably higher than 50 of its weight moisture holding capacity . The exchange capacity is larger than 0.1 equivalents per kilo of dry copolymer. In general, according to the present invention, aSAM resin salt is prepared by reacting the resin contain ing the acidic functional groups in the selected ionic form, with a SAM containing solution. An object of the present invention is also having prepared a SAM resin salt of pharmaceutical grade by directly reacting an ion exchange resin with the SAM contained within the lysate of microorganism cells. The resins which are preferentially but not limit edly used to this purpose are for instance pertaining to the following types Amberlite ER 151 BR 152 IR 120 Anberlite IRP 69 Trade name Roehm and Haas , finely subdivided Cenalit 5000, Bayer Duolite C 204 F, Diaprosim Duolite C 20 Duolite C 25 Duolite C 26 Duolite C 264 Duolite ES 467 Wofatit XPS, Wofatit Wofetit KPS AS Dowex HOR W, Dow Dowex 50 W Kastel C 300, Montedison Imacti C 12, AKZO Zerolit 225, Zeokarb Pielite CF, Resindion In the following Examples, the lysate outcomes from cells of Saccaromyces cerevisiae bread yeast . Other microoranisms with similar characteristics have been used with similar results. The process has shown to be extremely simple and economically advantageous, in comparison to the techniques of the prior art. The recovery of SAM from the lysate is between 90 and 100 . The purity of SAM contained in the resin salt has been between 90 and 100 . The reaction time has been comprised within the range of from O, n to 60 .

The suspension is sucked inside the syringe. The needle is replaced with a system needle 0.22,u filter.The solution of SAM can be injected, whilst the resin possibly present remains upstream of the filter. Summarizing, the invention allows a salt to be ob tained, whose main characteristics are stability capability of being compacted and compressed absence of hygroscopicity insolubility in water and in gastric juice easy release of SAM ion in basic environment and in enteric juice possibility of obtaining in vitro and in .vivo, by means of interchange reactions, SAM ions salified with desired anionic radicals phosphates, lac tates, glycerophosphates , by mixing measured and desir ed quantities of Na, X, Ca salts, and so on, containing precisely phosphates, lactates, glycerophosphates, and so on, as the anionic moiety, with the SAM resin salt. Further advantages of the invention are the stabi lity and easiness of handling of the salt in the common ly used pharmaceutical compositions, as well as the eco nomy of the preparation processes of such salts, and in addition, the possibility of preparing gastroresistant, that is, delayed, compositions. The possibility of releasing the active moiety al lows this drug to be used also in cutaneous and transdermal compositions. The insoluble salt can be administered under various pharmaceutical forms, such as for instance hard or soft capsules tablets with quick, slow, or controlled release sugar coated pills, pills, suspensions, suppositories, vaginal tablets, powders. The most suitable therapeutical use appears to be in the treatment of arthritis, periarthritis, and at cerebral level in depression syndromes. A particular characteristic of pharmaceutical technique which makes this novel salt different to the other SAK salts presently commercially available, is that it can be used both for solid and liquid pharmaceutical forms. The most suitable use of the compositions according to the invention is in the human and veterinary pharmaceutical field the invention however may be usefully employed also in the alimentary, agrarian, biological or generally chemical fields, in the zootechnic field, in the cosmetic field, and in other fields.
