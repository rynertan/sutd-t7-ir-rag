## Description
8ACKSROUND OF TH INVENTION This invention is directed to amorphous thermo plastic terpolymers containing sulfone groups. Polyarylene polyethers are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 4,175,175. This patent describes a polymer which has the following structure EMI1.1 This polymer is commercially available and is a tough, rigid, high strength thermoplastic which maintains its properties over a wide temperature range from 1500F to above 300 F. Polymer A has a good combination of mechanical properties and excellent electrical properties.Said polymer is highly resistant to mineral acids, alkali and salt solutions but will be attacked by environments such as polar organic solvents. Thus, there is a need to improve the environmental resistance, particularly the environmental stress crack resistance of Polymer A so that it can be used in applications where it will be exposed to an aggressive solvent environment. Attempts have been made to develop polymers which have the good properties of polymer A and additionally, improved environmental stress crack resistance. The following polymer B EMI1.2 has a good balance of mechanical properties, and possesses higher notched impact strength and heat deflection temperature than polymer A . Additionally, polymer B has improved stress crack resistance. Bowever, polymer B is prepared from 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and 4,4 biphenol. The 4,4 biphenol is difficult and costly to prepare and does not readily lend itself to commercial ization. Accordingly, a need still exists for a polymer which has the good combination of mechanical properties of polymer A and improved environmental stress crack resistance. A novel class of amorphous thermoplastic terpolymers has been discovered which can be easily prepared are inexpensive and thus lend themselves to cozmnercial ization. They possess an excellent combination of mechanical properties. Additionally, these novel terpolymers display high notched izod impact values, high heat distortion temperatures and have excellent environmental stress crack resistance. THE INVENTION This invention is directed to novel amorphous thermoplastic terpolymers. The terpolymers of this invention contain units of the formula EMI2.1 EMI3.1 tb 11 SEP R SEP Ra tb SEP , SEP and tb II SEP 4X SEP , SEP and tb SEP tionally tb EMI3.2 wherein R is independently hydrogen, C1 to C6 alkyl methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl or C4 toC8 cycloalkyl cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl , X is independentlyEMI3.3 wherein R and R2 are independently hydrogen or C1 to Cg L alkyl methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl EMI3.4 wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen or C1 to C8 alkyl methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl , and al is an integer of 3 to 8 S , O , orEMI3.5 a is an integer of O to 4 and n is independently an integer of 1 to 3 and wherein the ratio of unit I to the sum of units II and III is qreater than l. The units are attached to each other by an 0 bond. The preferred terpolymer of this invention contains units of the formula EMI3.6 These units are attached to each other by an 0 bond. The terpolymers may be random or may have an ordered structure. The terpolymers of this invention have a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than about 2.5, as measured in N methylpyrolidone, or other suitable solvent at 25 C. The terpolymers of this invention are prepared by reacting the monomers represented by the following formulae EMI4.1 VII and optionallyEMI4.2 wherein R, a, X and n are as previously defined, and X and Y are independently selected from Cl, Br, F,NO2 or OH and at least 50 percent of the Y s are OH. The ratio of the concentration of OH groups toCl, Br, F and or N02 groups used to form the polymer is from about 0,90 to about 1.10, preferably from about 0.98 to about 1.02. The monomers, represented by formulas IV, V and VII, include the following 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether, 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 didhlorodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 dinitrodiphenyl sulfone, 4 chloro 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 biphenol, hydroqulnone, and the like. The preferred monomers include 2,2 bis 4 iydroxy phenyl propane, 4,4 dichlorodiphenyl sulfone and 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone or 4 chloro 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone and optionally hydroquinone or 4,4 biphenol The polymers of this invention are prepared by contacting substantially equimolar amounts of the hydroxy containing compounds depicted in formulas IV to VII upra and halo and or nitro containing compounds depicted in formula IV and V supra with from about 0.5 to about 1.0mole of an alkali metal carbonate per mole of hydracyl group in a solvent mixture comprising a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water in order to maintain the reaction medium at substantially anhydrous conditions during the polymerization. The temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at from about 120 to about 180 C, for about 1 to about 5 hours and then raised and kept at from about 200 to about 250 C, preferably from about 210 to about 2300C, for about 1 to 10 hours. The reaction is carried out in an inert atmosphere, e.g., nitrogen, at atmospheric pressure, although higher or lower pressures may also be used. The polymer is then recovered by conventional techniques such as coagulation, solvent evaporation, and the like. The solvent mixture comprises a solvent which forms an azeotrope with water and a polar aprotic solvent.The solvent which forms an azeotrope with water includes an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, and the like. The polar aprotic solvents employed in this invention are those generally known in the art for the manufacture of polyarylether sulfones and include sulfur containing solvents such as those of the formula R1S b R1 in which each R1 represents a monovalent lower hydrocarbon group free of aliphatic unsaturatior which preferably contains less than about 8 carbon atoms or when connected together represents a divalent alkylene group with b being an integer from 1 to 2 inclusive. Thus, in all of these solvents all oxygens and two carbon atoms are bonded to the sulfur atom. Contemplated for use in this invention are such solvents as these having the formula EMI7.1 where the R2 groups are independently lower alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and like groups, and aryl groups such as phenyl and alkylphenyl groups such as the tolyl group, as well as those where the R2 groups are interconnected as in a divalent alkylene bridge such as EMI7.2 in tetrahydrothiophene oxides and dioxides. Specifically, these solvents include dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylsulfone, diphenylsulfone, diethylsulfoxide, liethylsulfone, diiso propylsulfone, tetrahydrothiophene l,l dioxide commonly called tetramethylene sulfone or sulfolane and tetrahydrothiophene l monoxide. Additionally, nitrogen containing solvents nay be used. These include dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide and N methylpyrolidone. The azeotrope forming solvent and polar aprotic solvent are used in a weight ratio of from about 10 1 to about 1 1, preferably from about 7 1 to about 5 l. In the reaction, the hydroxy containing compound is slowly converted, in situ, to the alkali salt thereof by reacting with the alkali metal carbonate. The alkali metal carbonate is preferably potassium carbonate.Mixtures of carbonates such as potassium and sodium carbonate may also be used. Water is continuously removed from the reaction mass as an azeotrope with the azeotrope forming solvent so that substantially anhydrous conditions are maintained during the polymerization. It is essential that the reaction medium be maintained substantially anhydrous during the polycondensation. While amounts of water up to about one percent can be tolerated, and are somewhat beneficial when employed with fluorinated dihalobenzenoid compounds, amounts of water substantially greater than this are desirably avoided as the reaction of water with the halo and or nitro compound leads to formation of phenolic species and only low molecular weight products are secured. Consequentlyw in order to secure the high polymers, the system should be substantially anhydrous, and preferably contain less than 0.5 percent by weight water during the reaction. Preferably, after the desired molecular weight has been attained,. the polymer is treated with an activated aromatic halide or an aliphatic halide such as methyl chloride or benzyl chloride, and the like. Such treatment of the polymer converts the terminal hydroxyl groups into ether groups which stabilize the polymer.The polymer so treated has good melt and oxidative stability. The terpolymers of this invention may be blended with one or more compatible thermoplastic polymers such as polyarylates, poly aryl ethers , polyetherimides, polyesters, aromatic polycarbonates including polyestercarbonates, polyurethanes, polybydroxyethers, Examples The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention.
