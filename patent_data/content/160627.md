## Description
D DESCRIPTION It is known that at a dining table several tiquiC condiments are required for example, but not exclusively, oil and vinegar or lemon which are to be sprinkled over the foods to be dressed at present, the metering of the individual condiments and their mutual proportionment depends on the user s ability.The individual condiments are mostly held either in indipendent or combined containers, but always for an indipendent and successive distribution. This invention has the purpose to permit the desired proportionment between two or more condiments as well as a desired and controlled metering of the dressing mixture to be delivered. The present invention provides cruet for metering and delivering condiments for use at a dining table, particularly for oil and other condiments which substantially comprises, in a body fitted as an obturator of a cruet or similar container for the main container oil or other a container of metered mixture for delivery at least a reservoir for a secondary component vinegar, lemon or other a pump means for sucking the main component and discharging it into the mixture container in controllable amounts and a passage with adjustable cross section between said reservoir and the suction duct of the pump means, for metering in adjustable proportions the second component respect to the main component. The mixture container and the reservoir for the secondary component may flank at opposite sides the pump means whose suction duct on which a valve is located dips id the cruet like container of the main component. Said passage in practice presents an adjustable orifice, with a valve means displaceable through an adJustable stroke by a screw ledge having a detering control knob, for the proportionment of the mixture. The pump means is able to suck unitary, constantcapacity amounts of mixture in order to dose the mixture amount through the number of pump strokes. Said pump means may be of rotary type with blades or similar, or of piston cylinder type including the dual with opposite pistons type. The invention will be better understood by following the description and the attached drawing which shows a practical non limitative exemplification of said invention. In the drawing Fig.l shows an outside view partially in section of a metering cruet according to the invention, made up with a pump means to be angularly handled Figs.2 and 3 show local sections through lines II II and Ill Ill of Fig.1 Figs.4 and 5 show the rotor alone. In the drawing, numeral 1 indicates a cruet like container for the main component of a mixture of two condiments, for example oil which is used in percentages much higher than the ones of the secondary components lemon, vInegar or other . The upper orifice of the container 1 is closed by a fitting 3 forming a passage 5 and a valve seat the fitting 3 is so shaped as to form the connection for a short pipe 7 for suction in the container 1. To the fitting 3 a body 9 is connected by screw means for example which presents a passage 10 as a continuation of the passage 5 and capable to engage a ball 12 making up the suction valve. The passage 10 goes into a cylindrical cavity 14 having horizontal axis, that is, at right angle to the cruet 1 axis said cavity is the seat of an eccentric rotor 16 of a rotary pump.The rotor 16 is mounted directly with an axial appendix 18 in a support formed by the body 9 and with an axial appendix 20 in a support formed by a lid 22 applied sideways on the body 9 to close the cavity 14. A snap coupling appendix 24 engages a crank 26 to a portion of non circular section 28 of the rotor 16, for the handling of the same. The rotor 16 presents axial and radial grooves 30 for receiving blades 30 apt to cooperate with the internal surface of the cavity 14 in order to define variable volume cavities between the passage 10 and an outlet 34 the blades 32 are for example two and are forced to slide radially in centrifugal direction into the axial and radial grooves 30 as they are biased by small springs 36 which operate between the two opposite blades and which are located in radial slots 38 being filleted to the two grooves 30. The body 9 forms at opposite sides of the cavity 14 and of an overhanging gripping ring 40 a reservoir 42 for the secondary component of the dressing and respectively a mixture container 44. The outlet 34 of the pump 14, 16, 32 leads into the mixture container 44 and the latter is provided with a spout 46 for delivery and, advantageously, also with a lid 48. The reservoir 42 for the secondary component of the mixture vinegar, lemon juice or other is also advantageously closed by a lid 50. At the bottom, a well shaped passage 52 extends from said reservoir and continues with a horizontal length 54 forming a seat for a member apt to create a section of an adjustable passage for the inlet of the secondary component into the passage 10 through the fitting 56.The horizontal length 54 is developed with two diameters, in order to form a seat with which an obturator 58 can cooperate, said obturator being mounted on a threaded stem 60 axially adjustable by rotating a side adjustment knob 62. The obturator 58 is elastically biased against the seat formed in the passage 54, and may be lifted therefrom according to adjustable amounts by the adjustment of stem 60, and after all it allovrsto adjust quite finelly the passage section of the secondary component which, from the reservoir 42,must reach the passage 10 to mix with the first component sucked through the valve 12, the passage 5 and the small pipe 7 of the cruet container 1.The adjustment of this passage section permits to change at will the mutual proportionment of the two dressing components, while the pump means manoeuvre made, by way of example,by the members and parts 14, 16, 32, 26 allows to suck at will desired amounts of mixture which are optainable by prolonging more or less the manoeuvre of the crank 26. The obturator 58 prevents the contents of container 42 from going out until the pump depression raises it from the seat. The mixture which is formed by suction of the first component through passage 7, 5, 12i 10 and of the second component through passage 52, 54, 56 and through the adjustable section described above is discharged into the mixture container 44 and may be easily delivered out from spout 46 the mixture amount metered by the pump manoeuvre may be used all at once or if desired made to stand in the container 44. It should be also cl6ar that an immediate and total mixture delivery from the container 44, at once after the discharge therein by means of the pump manoeuvre, allows for an exact amount metering and a mixing without any trend to separation through the various components stratification. numeral 80 indicates a handle for pouring the mixture into 44. It should be appreciated that the drawing shows an exemplification given only as a practical demonstration of the invention, as said invention may vary in the forms and dispositions without nevertheless departing from the scope of the idea that applies to the invention itself.For instance, it may provide a different pumping system, even of piston type rather thaa rotary type. In particular, a pump system may be provided with a horizontal cylinder, that is, providing a cavity similar to the 14 one and with only one piston, or even with two opposite pistons to operate a substantially balanced manoeuvre of the pumping system.
