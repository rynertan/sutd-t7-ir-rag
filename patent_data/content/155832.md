# STABLE PROTEINS, METHODS FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTION, PLASMIDS AND OTHER DNA ENCODING THEM, CELL CULTURES HARBORING SUCH PLASMIDS

## Abstract
Proteins are mutated in order to introduce disulfide linkages at sites not normally found in the wild type protein. Additional disulfide bonds formed in this fashion stabilize the proteins from inactivation.
