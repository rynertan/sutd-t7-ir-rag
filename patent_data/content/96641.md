# PROCESS FOR PREPARING PYRYLIUM SALTS

## Abstract
A process for selectively preparing isomers of polysub stituted pyrylium salts from isoolefins or isoolefin precursors comprises diacylating the isoolefin or isoolefin precursor with a carboxylic acid anhydride in the presence of an acid having a Hammett acidity function, when pure, between 10 and 5. This method is selective to obtain the most substituted isomer of pyrylium salt that can be obtained from the isoolefin or isoolefin precursor.
