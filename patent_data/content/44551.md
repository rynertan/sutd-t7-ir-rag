# Method of making a pressurized electrically activated high voltage photoflash lamp.

## Abstract
A method of making an electrically activated photoflash lamp which includes an ignition structure consisting of a pair of metallic lead wires 21, 23 and primer material 25 disposed on terminations thereof. The structure is hermetic ally sealed within the end of the lamp s glass envelope by firstly applying heat e.g., by gas oxygen burners to the open end portion of the tubing member 35 which eventual ly comprises the lamp s envelope sufficiently to cause the heated glass to flow about the conductors. The final configuration of this end is achieved by introducing a gas within the tubing member s remaining open end to cause the heated end to expand to the desired shape, whereupon the end is permitted to cool. The hermetic seal, as achieved during the initial heating stage, is retained. The desired internal component e.g., primer, combustible material, and combustion supporting gas are then added to the tubing member and the member s remaining open end sealed using a tipping off technique.

## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE METHOD OF MAKING ELECTRICALLY ACTIVATED PHOTOFLASH LAMP WITH IMPROVED SEALED END PORTIONTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to electrically activated photoflash lamps and particularly to methods of making such lamps. Lamps of the above type are generally classified into two varieties low voltage and lligh voltage. Low voltage photoflash lamps typically include a glass envelope with a combustion supporting gas e. g., oxygen and a quantity of filamentary, combustible material e.g., shredded zirconium therein. A pair of electrically conductive lead in wires are usually sealed in one end of the envelope and extend therein. A filament is utilized and interconnects the extending ends of the wires.When the filament is heated by a firing current usually generated from a low voltage source such as battery or charged capacitor G. g., having a voltage of from about 1.5 to 15 volts , it ignites a primer material which then ignites the combustible material to produce a flash of light. Naturally, the oxygen gas aids in the above ignition. In high voltage lamps, the use of a filament is usually excluded by the provision of a glass or ceramic bead in which are located the extending ends of the lamp s conductive lead in wires. Primer material serves to bridge the portions of these ends which project through the bead. High voltage laraps also include the aforedescribed filamentary material and combustion supporting gas.Flashing is nccomiilished by a low energy firing pulse approaching a few thousand volts and usually provided by a piezoelectric element. In another type of highvoltage lamp, the primer is located within an indentation in the bottom of the lamp and the conductive lead in wires extend therein The teachings of the present invention are particularly concerned with methods Or making high voltage lamps, although it will be understood from the following that said teachings may be readily extended to lamps of the earlier generation, low voltage variety. BACKGROUND In all of the above varieties of lamps, the conductive lead in wires which form part of the lamp s ignition structure are typically sealed within one end of the lamp s envelope using a press or pnch sealing operation during which the glass comprising this end portion is heated and compressed by a pair of opposing, parallel faced metallic press members which converge to engage the heated glass and effect said compression. At least one engagement per lamp is required and on some occasions, two or three are employed.Examples of such lamps are illustrated in U. S. Patents 3,290,906 Schilling et al , 3,752,636 Warninck , 3,884,615 Sobieski , and 4,059,389 Armstrong et al . While such a technique has proven to successfully provide a hermetic seal of the metallic lead in wires, the requirement of using a press seal possesses several drawbacks, particularly with regard to lamps having relatively small internal volumes e.g., less than 1.0 cubic centimeter .Firstly, there exists a strong tendancy for the two wires to swim within the molten glass during pressing, which in turn can result in the two becoming misaligned. Secondly, a press sealed end adds appreciably to the overall length of the lamp s envelope, a highly undesirable feature serving to defeat today s miniaturization efforts. Thirdly, the necessity for using a press seal adds to the overall costs of producing the lamp in that such a technique understandably requires complex lamp manufacturing equipment, which itself is both costly to produce and operate. It is believed therefore that a method of making an electrically activated photoflash lamp without the need for a press sealing operation while still assuring a sound, hermetically sealed envelope in the final product would constitute a significant advancement in the art.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, a primary object of the instant invention to provide a method Of making an electrically activated photoflash lamp without the need for a press sealing operation. It is another object of this invention to make such a method which readily lends itself to high sped production. In accordance with a main aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making an electrically activated photoflash lamp comprising the steps Of 1 retaining a glass tubing member having opposing open ends in a fixed position 2 orienting a pair of spaced electrical conductors within the first open end of the tubing member 3 heating the first end, causing it to soften and form a seal about the conductors without covering the terminations thereof 4 introducing a pressurized fluid within the tubing member through the second end to cause the heated first end to expand to a desired configuration while still retaining the seal between the glass and conductor members 5 cooling the expanded first end while retaining the expanded shape 6 applying primer material to at least one of the conductor terminotionst 7 positioning filamentary combustible within the tubing member through the second, open end and 8 sealing the second end to define a hermetically sealed envelope.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a front elevational view, in section, of an electrically activated photoflash lamp produced in accordance with the teachings of the instant inven tion and FIGS. 2 5 illustrate the various steps in carrying out the invention.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, advantages and capabilities thereof1 reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims in connection with the above described drawings. With particular reference to FIG. 1 there is shown an electricallyactivated photoflash lamp 10 manufactured in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention. Lamp 10 includes an hermetically sealed, light transmitting glass envelope 11 having first and second opposing sealed end portions 13 and 15 respectively. Suitable glass materials for envelope 11 include G l type soft glass having a mean coefficient of thermal expansion of about 85 to 95 x 10 in in C between 200C and 3000C, and the harder borosilicate glass recognized commercially as Corning type 7073, having a mean coefficient of thermal expansion of about 53.5 x 10 in in oC between OOC and 3000C.Borosilicate glass of this type possesses a typical composition ofabout63.4 SiO2, 7. 2 A1203, 17.8 B2O3, 0.6it LlO, 3. 9 No20, 4.6it K2O, 2.2no BaO, and 0.2 Cl. Another soft glass material successfully used in the invention is sold by the assignee of the instant invention under the product designation SG10 and is a potash soda lead glass haying a typical chemical composition, by weight, of about 61 silica dioxide, 21.5 lead oxide, 7.7 sodium oxide, 7.45 potassium oxide 2.1 alumina oxide, 015 arsenic trioxide and 0.1 calcium oxide.SG10 glass also has a thermal expansion rating of 93.1, an annealing point of about 432 degrees Celsius, a softening point Of about 626 degrees Celsius, and a dielectric constant of 6,7. It is thus understood that the invention is capable of being successfully accomplished utilizing both soft and hard type glasses. Located within envelope 11 is a quantity of filamentary combustible material 17 for providing a high intensity flash of light upon ignition thereof, the preferred material being shredded zirconium or hafnium. A quantity of about 2 to 40 milligrams is used although it is of course understood that the quantity of material 17 varies with the internal volume of envelope 11.Utilization of from 8 to 18 milligrams is preferred in lamps having envelopes with internal volumes equal to or less than 1.00 cubic centimeters, the preferred size for the envelopes of the present invention. Also within envelope 11 is a combustion supporting gas, e.g., oxygen, established at a pressure within the range of about 5 to about 15 atmospheres. The oxygen gas understandably serves to promote burning of shredded material 17 upon lamp ignition. Lamp 10 further includes an ignition means 19 disposed within end 13 for igniting the shredded zirconium or hafnium upon application of a suitable pulse as may be provided by a power source associated with many of todays electric cameras. One example of such a source is a piezoelectric element which is capable of providing a high voltage, low energy pulse approaching 5,000 volts.This element is typically located within the camera and provides said pulse through the camera s circuitry to a corresponding socket in which the photoflash device which includes several lamps 10 is inserted. Accordingly, it is understood that the photoflash lamp produced in accordance with the teachings of the instant invention is particularly adapted for use with multilamp photoflash devices and particularly those which depend on high voltage, low energy pulses to achieve sequential ignition of the lamps contained therein. Ignition means 19 includes a pair of spaced apart electrical conductors 21 and 23 which are hermetically sealed within end 13 of envelope 11 and project therefrom. Accordingly, the aforementioned high voltage pulse is applied across conductors 21 and 23 to in turn ignite means 19, which in turn almost instantaneously ignites combustible 17. Conductors 21 and 23 are metallic wires having a diameter of 0. 016 inch and are each comprised of a nickel iron alloy sold under the tradename Niron. An additional material especially preferred when using the aforementioned soft glass materials for envelope 11 is another nickel iron alloy referred to as 52 alloy, which possesses 7 0 a mean coefficient of thermal expansion of about 101.0 x 10 in in C between 0 0 25 C and 300 C.Still another acceptable materia for this type of glass is Dumet, a well known nickel iron alloy covered with a thin film coating of copper.When using the harder glass materials for envelope 11, conductors 21 and 23 were preferably formed from a metal alloy of iron, nickel, and cobalt, said material known commercially as Rodar or Kovar. This alloy has a composition which is approximately 54 Fe, 29 Si 17io po, etc0.5 Mn, 0.2 29 Si,, and 0. 06 C and a mean coefficient of thermal expansion of about 50 x 10 7 in in OC between 250C and 3000C. Each wire conductor 21 and 23 is hermetically sealed within first end 13 in accordance with the unique teachings of the invention to be described below and includes an enlarged, rounded termination portion 25 FIGS. 2 4 upon which is located the remaining portion of ignition means 19, a quantity of primer material 27. As shown in FIG. 1, primer 27 is positioned on both terminations to thus substantially cover same and be in electrical contact therewith. The circuit path between the spaced apart conductors is provided by the 6 iUeddcd zirconium or hafnium, which thus bridges these members.It is also within the teachings of the invention to cover only one termination 25 with primer and connect this material with the remaining, exposed wire conductor termination 25. Still further, the invention permits the use of non enlarged termination portions which may ba located flush with the lower interior surface of envelope 11 at end 13 with a single, large mass of primer 27 bridging the two terminations. Other alternative embodiments are well within the scope of the present teachings. Approximately two milligrams of primer 27 is used in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a preferred material comprising about 99 zirconium powder and 1 cellulose nitrite on a dried basis.The rounded, enlarged terminations are formed by applying a flame to each of the several ends of wires 21 and 23 to cause the ends to melt back to the rounded configu ration depicted. Primer 27 is added to terminations 25 in the manner defined below. Ignition of lamp 10 is achieved by application of the aforedefined high voltage pulse across the externally projecting ends of conductors 21 and 23 to cause an electrical breakdown of primer 27, resulting in a deflagration thereof and ignition of material 17. The total light output of finished lamp 10 is about 2,500 to 3,500 lumen seconds although it is of course understood that this level can be either increased or decreased significantly by varying the quantities of zirconium or hafnium , the internal envelope pressures, etc. Dimensionwise, lamp 10 has an envelope external length of about 0.700 inch, an external diameter of about 0. 300 inch, and a wall thickness of about 0. 032 inch. This substantially reduced size over many known comparative lamps makes lamp 10 especially adaptable to todays miniaturization efforts regarding multilamp photoflash devices. In FIGS. 2 5, there are illustrated the preferred steps in the method of making lamp 10. In FIG. 2, a preformed lead wire structure 31 is illustrated as being positioned within a holder 33 located below a vertically oriented elongated piece of glass tubing 35 having opposing open ends 37 and 39. Tubing member 35 preferably has an external diameter of 0.300 inch, and an internal diameter of 0. 236 inch. It is understood that tubing member 35 is to eventually comprise the envelope 11 illustrated in FIG. 1. AccordingLy, member 35 is comprised of one of the aforementioned glass materials. Member 35 is securedly retained within a second holder 41. As illustrated, open end 37 is vertically positioned below the upper open end 39 and the pair of projecting ends of wire structure 31 are aligned so as to project vertically upward within end 37 and therefore inside of tubing member 35 a predetermined distance. It is understood that these projecting ends eventually comprise metallic lead wires 21 and 23 of the finished lamp 10.Accordingly, said projecting wires are given the numerals 21 and 23 in FIGS.2 5. Subsequent to sealing these projecting components within end 37 to be described below , structure 31 is released from holder 33. Prior to the above procedure, it is preferred to cover selected portions of terminations 25 with a glass first coating not shown approximately 1.5 to 2 mils thick. The preferred frit, consisting of a fine powder of glass blended with a binder of amyl acetate and nitrocellulose, is prepared in slurry form and terminations 25 dipped therein. Air drying is used to dry.the wet slurry coating prior to orientation within tubing member 35. As described in U.S. patent 4,059,389, frit coatings have been found to successfully prevent preignition short circuits across the lamp s conductors through the combustible material. A second feature of this material is that utilization thereof results in a near doubling of the primer breakdown voltage required to ignite lamp 10. This in turn assures a more reliable finished photoflash unit and a substantial reduction in production shrinkage. Other features, advantage, etc of using glass frit coatings in an ignition structure such as that shown in FIG. 1 are fully detailed in 4,059,389.It is of course understood that when primer 27 is added to the terminations 25 having a frit coating thereon, selected regions of coating are removed to assure an electrical connection between the metal conductors and corresponding primer. When using the glass tubing member 35 having the described internal diameter and wall thickness, it is preferred that conductors 21 and 23 project alBoutQ120 inch within open end 37. Once the conductors 21 and 23 are positioned therein in the manner illustrated in FIG. 2, heat is applied to preselected external areas of the open end portion 37 of tubing glass member 35 so as to raise the temperature thereof sufficiently to cause this end to soften, that is, to assume a plastic state. while in this state, end portion 37 to comprise the first sealed ond 13 of lamp 10 assumes a beaded form about the projecting wires 21 and 23 such that the wires are surrounded in the manner depicted in FIG. 3.It is believed that this beading action is the result of surface tension forces acting upon the glass while in the described plastic state. The surprising result is a hermetic seal of end portion 37 with tile conductors 21 and 23 sealed and secured therein. As shown in FIG. 3, this unique procedure provided the defined seal without glass material covering the terminations of the respective wire members 21 and 23.The terminations 25 are thus free of glass and capable of providing the subse quent electrical contact with the lamp s primer material 27 to be applied later The defined application of heat to tubing member 35 is preferably accomplished by utilization of a pair of opposing gas oxygen burners 45 located on opposing sides of the cylindrical tubing member each burner preferably adjacent a respective one of the wire conductors. Use of gas oxygen or similar pressurized burners is preferred over other forms of heating e. g., resistance type because the forces exerted by the impinging flames against the heated external surfaces Cf member 35 serve to accelerate the aforedescribed deforming and sealing operation.The preferred temperatures for heating open end portion 37 are within the range of between 600 degrees Celsius and 1150 degrees Celsius, depending on the glass material utilized. It is of course only essential to heat the glass of the tubing member s first end portion to a temperature sufficient to cause it to assume the defined plastic or softened state such that it will flow about conductors 21 and 23.The resulting configuration FIG. 3 assumed by the heated glass of first end 37, though forming a sound, hermetic seal with conductors 21 and 23, was not deemed totally satisfactory for use in lamp 10 because of its relatively reduced volume caused by the indentations or depressions within the heated glass sides . Accordingly, it was surprisingly determined that this end portion could be expanded while in the heated state without sacrificing the hermetic seal retained. This was achieved by introducing .1 pressurized fluid within tubing member 35 through the remaining, upper open end 39. The preferred fluid used was air, however, inert gases e.g., nitrogen, argon could also be successfully used.The fluid was passed through a suitable nozzle 51 FIG. 4 which was located immediately adjacent or even partially within end 39. The surprising end result was an expanding or ballooning of the heated glass sides of end portion 37 to a rounded configuration in the manner depicted inFIG 4. With regard to the invention, by the term pressurized is meant the introduction of a fluid within the open ended tubular member to increase the internal pressure of the member and causes the described expansion or ballooning of the member s heated 3nd tt7 This increased pressure within the tubing member would inherently be greater than atmospheric. Nozzle 51 contained, in one example, an orifice 0.032 inch in diameter and was connected to a twenty one inch steel manifold having an internal diameter of 1.00 inch. The pressure within the manifold was established at fifty pounds. After permitting the glass to cool to room temperature, the resulting shape was also surprisingly found to be stronger than ends formed using the aforedefined press sealing techniques, as indicated by scratch and upshock tests normally used to test small glass structures such as photoflash lamps.The most significant gain, however, was in overall internal volume for lamp 10 compared to a similar length envelope having a press seal. A typical press sealed end accounted for about 22 of the total envelope length. Using a seal made possible by the teachings of the invention, a similar length and diameter envelope realized a volume increase over the press sealed envelopes of about 15 per cent. By way of example, an envelope having an overall length of 0.700 inch, an external diameter of 0.300 inch, and a wall thickness of 0.032 inch, realized a gain in internal length of about 0.06 inch over a comparative sized externally press sealed envelope. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce internal pressure without altering the envelope s exterior dimensions.Alternatively, it is possible to produce lamps having reduced external features while maintaining the desired similar internal volumes.Still another highly advantageous feature of the invention is that it can be readily performed on existing photoflash production equipment without substantial modification thereto, as clearly indicated by the relatively simple components e.g., holders 33, 41 required. In FIG. 5, there is illustrated the final steps of manufacturing lamp 10 in accordance with the teachings of the invention. The terminations of wires 21 and 23 have been coated with primer 27 using a suitable applicator not shown introduced through end 39. Subsequent to drying of the primer, the necessary quantity of filamentary combustible 17 is added, also through open end 39.Any dispenser known in the art can be employed to locate material 17 and further definition is not believed necessary. This also holds true for the means of depositing primer 27. It is understood from the above that primer 27 is applied while in a liquid state and subsequently dries while in position. This drying can be facilitated by the introduction of heated air through second end 39. Additionally, the shredded zirconium or hafnium material 17 is inserted within open end 39 in order to frictionally engage the internal side walls of tubing member 35 in the manner illustrated in FIG. 5.Glass tubing member 35 is then evacuated through open end 39, a quantity of the described combustionsupporting gas oxygen is introduced within the member 35 through end 39, and end 39 is thereafter sealed using a tipping off technique. Such a technique is well known in the art of manufacturing photoflash lamps and further definition is not deemed necessary. It is known, of course, that such a technique requires a necking down of the tubing member in the region of end 39 prior to final closure, thus resulting in a discarding of that portion of glass material above the constricted region and corresponding reduction from the original length to the desired 0.700 inch length for final envelope 11. In the above technique, the upwardly projecting wires 21 and 23 were positioned within open end 37 so as not to engage the internal surfaces of this end portion of the glass tubing member. This alignment FIG. 2 was considered necessary in order to accomplish the unique hermetic sealing des cribed. It was also observed during all of the above techniques that direct exposure of wires 21 and 23 to the flames emitted by the gas oxygen burners 45 on occasion resulted in the formation of a loose oxide layer on the wires.Such a layer could defeat formation of a sound hermetic seal between the grass and metal components and eventually result in gas leakage in the finished product. This potential problem was readily overcome by directing the burner flames only onto the designated glass surfaces FIGS. 2, 3 . Understandably, utilization of other varieties of heaters may also prevent such an occurrence. The use of the gas oxygen burners 45 is preferred, however, for the reason cited. There has thus been shown and described a new and unique process for forming a hermetic seal within an end of a glass envelope between the glass and the photoflash lamp s metallic lead wires secured within the end.The described technique eliminates the need for the aforementioned press seal and therefore provides the several advantageous features described above. While there have been shown and described what are at present considered the preferred embodiments of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
