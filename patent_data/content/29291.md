# Method for preparing a precured silicone emulsion.

## Abstract
An aqueous silicone emulsion is described which pro vides an elastomeric product upon removal of the water under ambient conditions. The emulsion comprises a continuous wa ter phase and a dispersed phase of crosslinked silicone. The silicone phase is the product of radical produced crosslinking of hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane. The polydiorga nosiloxane is crosslinked after it has been dispersed in water. Preferred polydiorganosiloxanes contain vinyl substituted silo xane units and can be crosslinked by high energy radiation or the combined action of heat and an organic peroxide.
