# Method and apparatus for inhibiting combustible fluid flowing through a conduit and system including apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for inhibiting combustible fluid flowing through a conduit to a fire comprises a body 1 through which combustible fluid must flow before entering the conduit. The body 1 has an inlet 2 and an outlet 3 . A nozzle 8 faces the inlet 2 of the body 1 and is disposed proximate the tapered end of a generally conical diffuser 4 . If a fire breakes out in the conduit helium or other extingu ishing fluid is released from a pressurized cylinder into the body 1 through nozzle 8 . The helium travels towards the inlet 2 and is diffused across the entire cross section of the body 1 as it hits the tapered sides of the generally conical diffuser 4 . The helium forms a blanket which inhibits further combustible gas entering the conduit whilst at the same time purging the conduit.
