## Abstract
Container for transporting and likewise dispensing liquids, provided with a receptacle having the shape of a flexible plastics bag 1 with a discharge spout 2 , provided in a more rigid, supporting and enveloping box 6,7 , a so called bag in box package. It can be brought from a transport posi tion, in which the flexible liquid bag with attached discharge spout is enclosed protectively in the enveloping box, in an operating position wherein, with avoidance of spilling of liquid through pressure on bag and spout, the liquid bag is likewise enclosed in the box, however the discharge spout extends in the container in such a way that it can be opera tively combined with an operating mechanism disposed in a beverage vending machine, in order to dispensingly pump liquid from the bag.
