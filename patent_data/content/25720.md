## Description
DESCRIPTION i ffXE1 I jOSPHORIC ACIJ ESTER COtIPOSIlIOlIS, PROCESS FOR TIiT MANUFACTURE THEREOF A.ND PLASIICISED POLE.,ERS CONTAINING HELi This invention relates to a new method of manufacture of mixed esters of orthophosphoric acid, hereinafter referred to as phosphoric acid and to the mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions obtained thereby.More particularly, this invention relates to an improved commercial process for the production of mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions containing substantial amounts of the compounds wherein R1 is the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals and R2 is the same or a different aliphatic radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals. The mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions prepared by the novel process of the present invention contain at least about 10 mole percent of the compoundEMI1.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the radicals defined above and may be vacuum distilled to give nearly colorless liquids.These mixed ester compositions have exceptional utility as flexibilizing plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride compositions, imparting to such compositions flexibility at 150C to 350C when used as the sole plasticizer in a polyvinyl chloride composition at 50 parts per hundred. Such plasticized polyvinyl chloride compositions also offer the advantages of non inflammability, low loss of plasticizer at higher temperatures low volatility and reduced smoke formation upon burning. Mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions, prepared by the process to be described, are characterized by high autogenousEMI1.2 ignition temperatures, low pour points and compatibility with paraffinic hydrocarbon oils and may be used, either alone or in combination with paraffinic hydrocarbon oils to prepare hydraulic and torque converter fluids that have excellent stability at very high temperatures.Such mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions also find use as lubricants either alone or in combination with other known lubricants with which they are compatible. Combinations of such mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions with the alkanoic acid esters of organic polyhydroxy compound such as pentaerythritol, polymethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, neopentyl glycol and the like form heat stable high pressure lubricants. When the mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions of the above invention are used as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride polymers and copolymers, it is to be emphasized that the large number of different phosphate ester species that are present in the plasticizer composition provides an exceptional advantage in that the resulting plasticized polyvinyl chloride polymers are heat stable to milling and fabrication, while maintaining low temperature flexibility in the range of 15 C to 350C when used as the sole plasticizer at 50 parts per hundred. Various methods are known for the production of mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions, however, few of the processes described in the art have proven to be commercially feasible. Millions of pounds of mixed aryl esters of phosphoric acid have been made by the process taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,576,923 wherein phenol is alkylated in the presence of a FriedelCrafts catalyst and the whole of the product resulting from the alkylation of the phenol is treated with phosphorus oxychloride. The resulting product is a mixed phosphate ester wherein the substituents on the phosphorus atoms are phenols and substituted phenols generally C3 C4 substituted phenols .The process to be described may give a much more complex ester mixture containing different ester species wherein the substituents on the phosphorus atom are derived from aliphatic alcohols, and alkoxyalcohols containing up to 18 carbon atoms in addition to phenols and substituted phenols. The manufacture of alkyl aryl phosphate esters is also known but the process employed to obtain such products is directed to esters of high purity containing a single species. A common procedure described is that of reacting 2 moles of phenol or similar hydroxy aryl compound with 1 mole of phosphorus oxychloride, removing the HC1 formed under vacuum, and then reacting the diphenyl phosphoryl chloride with 1 mole of an aliphatic alcohol. This procedure is objectionable as the initial phosphorylation reaction is difficult to control and excessive quantities of the triaryl derivatives are formed, necessitating distillation of a highly corrosive mixture of phosphoryl chlorides.Another procedure described is that of preparing the triaryl phosphates, removing one aryl group by alkaline hydrolysis followed by steam distillation and then introducing the alkyl group. The principal objectionable feature of this process is that it is exceedingly costly in view of the increased number of steps required to produce the finished product. A further method described is that of reacting in excess of 1 mole of an aliphatic alcohol with 1 mole of phosphorus oxychloride, removing the HC1 formed under vacuum, purifying the monoalkyl phosphoryl dichloride by distillation and subsequently reacting at a relatively high temperature the purified acid chloride with 2 moles of phenol or similar hydroxy aryl compound.According to this latter process, in order to obtain pure neutral phosphate esters, it is essential that the intermediate alkyl phosphoryl dichloride be separated from the reaction mixture and purified. This is accomplished by fractional distillation of the acid chloride from the reaction mass. Pure esters may also be obtained by fractionating the crude neutral phosphate esters. This process has given satisfactory results when the aliphatic alcohol used was a primary alcohol of relatively short chain length. However, it is known that secondary, tertiary, and substituted alcohols are not suited to this reaction. Typical alcohols which do not satisfactorily undergo the reaction as described are the allyl or substituted allyl alcohols, nitro alcohols, secondary butyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol and 2 octanol.Moreover, it has been found that monoalkyl phosphoryl dichlorides tend to decompose with such decomposition being dependent upon time and temperature. In the case of the lower alkyl phosphoryl dichlorides, such as the C1 C4 alkyl phosphoryl dichlorides, the boiling points of the compositions are lower than their respective decomposition temperature range under commercially practical subatmospheric pressure thereby permitting purification of the monoalkyl phosphoryl dichloride by fractionation. However, the decomposition temperature ranges of the higher molecular weight monoalkyl phosphoryl dichlorides which are intermediate to the formation of the monoalkyl diaryl phosphate esters that may be present in the mixed ester composition prepared by this process are lower than their respective boiling points that could be obtained under commercially feasible subatmospheric pressures, thus rendering purification of the intermediate monoalkyl phosphoryl dichlorides by commercial fractionation impossible.Furthermore, if purified intermediate alkyl phosphoryl dichlorides are obtained and subsequently reacted with hydroxy aryl compounds to form monoalkyl diaryl phosphates, the relatively high temperatures required to cause the reaction to proceed essentially quantitatively are again higher than the decomposition temperature ranges of the respective alkyl phosphoryl dichlorides and consequently decomposition again results. A process for the manufacture of monoalkyl diaryl phosphate ester wherein the single alkyl group may contain from 6 to 18 carbon atoms and may be a betaalkoxy ethyl radical of 4 to 18 carbon atoms is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,504,121 and 2,557,090 alkyl group may contain 4 12 carbon atoms . Both patents, however, are directed to the preparation of pure monoalkyl diaryl phosphate esters. This process involves reaction of phosphorus oxychloride with one mole of an alcohol to yield a monophosphoryl dichloride, which is then reacted with two moles of a sodium phenate.This yields a product of high purity which is not as effective a plasticizer as the complex mixture of products that result from the present invention.Further, this method produces large quantities of sodium salts which are difficult to remove and dispose of.In addition, the side reaction of alkyl phosphoryl dichloride with alcohol produces substantial quantities of alkyl halide as a by product. The recently issued 1975 Polish Patent No.78,616 describes the transesterification of a triaryl phosphate with an aliphatic alcohol containing 6 12 carbon atoms in its molecule in the presence of 0.2512 parts of sodium or potassium by weight at a temperature of 200C 2000C for 1 10 hours, wherein the weight ratio of triaryl phosphate to alcohol may vary between 100 40 and 100 200. One technical advantage claimed in the Polish patent is that this process yields a final product of greater purity. The sole example of this patent, however, gives an impure residue that is dark yellow to brown in color which decomposes when attempts are made to purify it by vacuum distillation. The transesterification of tertiary alkyl phos phates by heating with alcohols having a higher molecular weight radical than that present in the ester is also known. In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of sodium alkoxide, the reaction results in mixtures of mono and di exchange products in rather poor yields.Substantial quantities of ether are formed with the alkoxide and are present in the reaction mixture. Mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions containing phenyl and substituted phenyl groups attached to the phosphorus atom through an oxygen linkage are known and are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,576,923 referred to above and 3,553,155. Alkoxy diaryl phosphates are also known and are described in U.S. PatentNos. 2,557,090 referred to above and 2,557,091.The patents referred to above mention that certain phosphate esters are useful as plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride polymers. In view of the teachings of the prior art, one would not believe that commercial production of mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions containing substantial quantities of two or more different ester species having both aromatic and aliphatic substituents on the phosphorus atom would be economically practical or feasible. Moreover, no commercial method for the manufacture of mixed alkyl and or alkoxyalkyl phosphate compositions containing substantial amounts of compounds having the formulae EMI6.1 wherein R1 is the same or a different radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals and R2 is the same or a different aliphatic radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals was known prior to the present invention. First, considering the prior art teaching that a higher radical than that present in the ester was required for transesterification to occur, it would not be expected that a low molecular weight alcohol such as n butanol would replace higher molecular weight aromatic radicals such as the phenyl and isopropyl phenyl radicals. Secondly, the prior art does not suggest that the dialkyl aryl phosphate in the mixture prepared by transesterification would be present in amounts of more than about 10 mole percent. And thirdly, the prior art states that substantial amounts of ether by products are always produced by exchange esterification of tertiary phosphates. In accordance with the novel process of the present invention, an ester of phosphoric acid having the formula EMI7.1 wherein R1 may be the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals is reacted in an anhydrous system and in the presence of a catalytic amount of sodium with an aliphatic alcohol having the formula R2CH2 CH20H wherein R2 is the same or a different aliphatic radical containing from 2 to 16 carbon atoms, selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals to form a transesterification mixture containing substantial amounts of the two compounds EMI7.2 wherein R1 is the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals ani R2 is the same or a different aliphatic radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals.The mixed phosphoric acid ester composition so obtained is separated from alcohols present in the transesterification mixture as a colorless liquid by vacuum distillation.The isolated mixture of phosphate esters typically contains at least about 10 weight percent of dialkyl aryl phosphate, at least about 50 weight percent of dialkyl aryl phosphate plus alkyl diaryl phosphate, and less than about 4 weight percent tri aryl phosphate. Preferably, the distilled phosphate ester mixture will contain about 15 to about 20 weight percent dialkyl aryl phosphate, about 65 to 80 weight percent alkyl diaryl phosphate and up to about 4 weight percent triaryl phosphate. It is an advantage of this invention to provide a process for the manufacture of mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions containing at least about 10 weight percent of the compoundEMI8.1 wherein R1 is the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals,R2 is the same or a different aliphatic radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals. It is a further advantage of this invention to provide an improved commercially feasible process for the manufacture of a mixed phosphoric acid ester composition containing substantial amounts of the compounds EMI8.2 wherein R1 is the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals and R2 is the same or a different aliphatic radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals. It is also an advantage of the present invention to prepare plasticized polyvinyl chloride polymer compositions characterized by low temperature flexibility, heat and flame resistance and reduced smoke levels. As stated above, the starting material is a tertiary aromatic ester of phosphoric acid having the formula EMI9.1 wherein R1 may be the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals. Thus, the starting material may itself be a mixed ester of phosphoric acid such as isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate or isobutylphenyl phenyl phosphate or mixtures of both isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate and isobutylphenyl phenyl phosphate, the preparation of which are described inU.S. Patent No. 3,576,923 referred to above .The substituents on the phenyl radical of such mixed phosphate ester compositions can be obtained by alkylating phenol, prior to phosphorylation, with olefins such as ethylene, propylene, butene l, butene 2, isobutylene, pentene l, 2 methyl butene l, hexene l, cyclohexene, heptene l, 2 methyl pentene l propylene dimer , octene l, cyclo octene, nonene l, decene l, cyclodecene, undecene L, dodecene l, cyclododecene, tetradecene and hexadecene. The oleo in may be a single olefin or a mixture of two or more thereof. Examples of mixtures which are particularly suitable for use as alkylating agents because of their ready availability include caprylene a mixture of isomeric octenes , propylene trimer a mixture of isomeric nonenes , propylene tetramer a mixture of isomeric dodecenes , diisobutylene a mixture of 2,4,4 trimethylpentene l and 2,4,4 trimethylpentene 2 , tri isobutylene a mixture of dodecenes consisting predominantly of 2,4,4,6,6 pentamethylheptene1 , and tetraisobutylene a mixture of hexadecenes consisting predominantly of 2,4,4,6,6,8,8 heptamethylnonene l . The starting material may also be a single pure compound such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate, and so forth, and mixtures of such pure compounds. The alcohol that is employed in the transesterification reaction may be any monohydric aliphatic alcohol that is not substituted on the a or ss carbon atoms. Suitable aliphatic alcohols for use in the transesterification reaction include ethoxyethyl alcohol butoxyethyl alcohol iso octyl alcohol octyl alcohol nonyl alcohol trimethylhexyl alcohol decyl alcohol dodecyl alcohol hexoxyethyl alcohol n hexoxyethyl alcohol iso octoxyethyl alcohol n octoxyethyl alcohol nonoxyethyl alcohol 2 ethylhexanol trimethylhexoxyethyl alcohol n decoxyethyl alcohol dodecoxyethyl alcohol tridecyl alcohol tridecoxyethyl alcohol tetradecyl alcohol tetradecoxyethyl alcohol pentadecyl alcohol pentadecoxyethyl alcohol hexadecyl alcohol hexadecoxyethyl alcohol heptadecyl alcohol heptadecoxyethyl alcohol octadecyl alcohol octadecoxyethyl alcohol Particularly useful in the practice of the present invention are alcohols having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms and the commercially available alkoxyalcohols such as the RTI ID 11.1 CELLOSOLVESTM having the formula CnH2n1 O CH2 CH2OH and the CARBITOLSTM having the formula CnH2nl O CH2 CH2 O CH2 CH2 OH wherein n is an integer from 1 to 18. The higher molecular weight alcohols above C12 produce mixed phosphate esters that are low in volatility but difficult to distill. Mixtures of any two or more aliphatic alcohols and alkoxyalcohols may also be used in the process of this invention. It is critical in effecting the transesterification reaction of the present invention that anhydrous conditions be maintained throughout the reaction.As many of the alcohols employed, and particularly vthe lower molecular weight alcohols are hydroscopic, precautions must be taken that all reactants are thoroughly dry. The presence of moisture has a pronounced effect on the transesterification of esters of phosphoric acid and modifies the composition of the reaction product to an extent that does not occur in the alcoholysis of esters derived from organic acids. The relative proportions of the phosphate ester and the alcohol present in the reaction mixture may vary widely and will depend upon the degree of substitution desired during the transesterification reaction. In general, the degree of substitution of the alcohol and alkoxyalcohol radicals for other radicals present in the starting phosphate ester will be related to the amount of alcohol present in the reaction mixture and will increase as the relative amount of alcohol is increased. Desirably the mole ratio of alcohol to tertiary phosphate ester will vary from about 0.5 1 to about 10 1. The process of the present invention is catalyzed by catalytic amounts of sodium in the range of 0.01 to 0.05 weight percent of the reaction mixture. It is suspected that the reaction may be promoted by sodium alkoxide that is formed in situ. However, sodium alkoxide that is prepared externally of the reactor and then added to the reaction mixture in catalytic amounts has been found to be much less effective. It is an advantage of the process of the present invention that transesterification occurs rapidly at relatively low temperatures, i.e., up to about 1000C. However, temperatures of up to 700C are preferred to avoid ether formation, with temperatures in the range of 600C 700C being most preferred. Earlier investigators have found it necessary to heat the reaction mixture to much higher temperatures 1300C 1700C and for longer periods of time 4 9 hours to effect the itransesterification of aryl phosphate esters. By way of contrast, the transesterification reaction herein described occurs within the first 15 minutes and usually reaches equilibrium in about 4 hours at 600C 700C to produce a reaction product containing substantial quantities, i.e., more than 50 mole percent of the mono and di substituted phosphate esters. The start ing triaryl phosphate ester, i.e., about 4 weight percent and the trialkyl substituted phosphate ester may also be present in the reaction mixture. It is another advantage of the process of the present invention that the formation of ethers which generally occurs during the transesterification of phosphate ester is minimized. In accordance with the present invention, the mixed esters of phosphoric acid that are formed during the transesterification process may be separated from the reaction mixture by vacuum distillation. This is a most important improvement over other known methods of preparing phosphoric acid esters, such as the alkyldiaryl phosphate esters described in U.S. Patent No.2,504,121. That method, which reacts an alkyl phosphoryl dichloride with a sodium phosphate solution washes the ester product with water. The water washing step is quite expensive since the wash water must be treated prior to discarding to avoid environmental problems. The process of the present invention provides a commercially feasible method for the manufacture of novel mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions that are stable and may be heated to elevated temperatures during processing. One such mixed phosphoric acid ester composition to be described below is a clear liquid at room temperature that contains about 78 weight percent isodecyl diphenyl phosphate about 1520 weight percent of phenyl diisodecyl phosphate and about 4 weight percent triphenyl phosphate. Another example of a relatively complex mixed phosphoric acid ester composition of Applicants invention might contain different phosphate esters having the formula EMI13.1 wherein R1 is the same or a different radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals, R2 is the same or a different radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals and n is 0 3. Such a mixed phosphoric acid ester composition, that may be prepared by the process of the present invention from a mixed isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate and butoxyethanol, may contain different phosphate esters having the formulae EMI14.1 EMI15.1 The above compounds are listed to present some of the many possibilities and it will be understood that other species not specifically described will be present depending upon the complexity of the mixed isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate starting material. It will be understood that the novel mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions described and claimed herein may be made by reacting one or more aliphatic alcohols or alkoxyalcohols with any triaryl phosphoric acid ester or mixture of such phosphoric acid esters. The mixed phosphoric acid ester composition which may be readily manufactured by the process of the present invention containing at least 10 weight percent of monoaryl dialkyl or monoaryl dialkoxyalkyl phos phate and a substantial amount, i.e., at least about 50 weight percent of two different compounds having the formulae EMI16.1 wherein R1 is the same or a different aromatic radical selected from phenyl and substituted phenyl radicals and R2 is an aliphatic radical selected from alkyl and alkoxy radicals. An illustration of Applicants novel mixture that contains only four phosphate esters encompassed by the above formula would be a mixed phosphoric acid ester composition containing substantial amounts of the following phosphate esters tris butoxyethyl phosphate, di butoxyethyl phenyl phosphate, butoxyethyl diphenyl phosphate, and tr iphenyl phosphate. c ft is characteristic of Applicants process that the dibutoxyethyl phenyl phosphate is present in amounts of at least about 10 weight percent. Such a composition has been found to be particularly advantageous as a plasticizer for polyvinyl chloride polymers particularly when heat resistance to milling and processing is desired of the plasticized polyvinyl chloride. We have discovered that the novel mixed phosphoric acid ester composition of the present invention has a satisfactory viscosity range and is useful as a plasticizer for resins such as cellulose acetate and vinyl acetate, and particularly useful as plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride polymers and copolymers of vinyl chloride with not more than 20 of monomer other than vinyl chloride, for example, vinylidene chloride and or acrylonitrile.Such mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions in amounts of from about 30 to about 150 parts per 100 parts of polymer impart to the polyvinyl chloride polymer not only low temperature flexibility and fire resistance but also stability at the elevated temperatures of extrusion i.e., 1800C 2000C. Particularly preferred plasticizers for polyvinyl chloride polymers to be used in wire coating application are the mixed alkoxyalkyl, phenyl and substituted phenyl phosphates. The plasticized polyvinyl chloride polymer may, of course, also comprise other conventional additives, particularly one or more heat or light stabilizers and or antioxidants.The unexpected heat stability during the molding process of polyvinyl chloride resins that are plasticized with the phosphoric acid mixed esters of the present invention is not understood. It is believed that stability of the plasticized polyvinyl chloride resin at elevated temperatures is a reflection of the compatibility of the mixed phosphoric acid ester plasticizers of the present invention with stabilizers present in the resin composition.Stabilizers are added to polyvinyl chloride compositions and perform the function of protecting the polyvinyl chloride resin from decomposition when subjected to a high energy source, principally thermal energy, although light and other radiant energy can exercise similar degradative effects. Although there is not universal agreement regarding the various mechanisms of stabilization, it is generally accepted that the chemistry responsible for instability involves dehydrochlorination of vinyl chloride polymer chains. Once initiated in a polymer chain, the reaction becomes autocatalytic giving rise to large quantities of corrosive hydrogen chloride and leaving a highly unsaturated polymer residue.Double bonds in this residue tend to be conjugated because of the head to tail nature of the vinyl polymerization placing chlorine atoms on alternating carbon atoms of the backbone chain. The resulting conjugated polymer undergoes further reaction including crosslinking and cyclization of aromatic residues, many of the products being colored chloromophores. In fact, the first evidence of instability in polyvinyl chloride compositions is usually seen by discoloration to yellow, then brown and ultimately black. To retard or delay this decomposition of the vinyl polymer during high temperature processing, including compounding, extrusion, molding, etc., stabilizers are used in the compound formulation. Three general types of stabilizers are employed. 1 Organometallic derivatives of metals such as Ba, Cd, Zn, Sn, Ca and Pb. Typically these are simple soaps of fatty acids because of the relatively low costs of such derivatives. Presumably, these function as bases to absorb initally released HC1 and suppress autocatalytic influence of the acid on further dehydrohalogenation. 2 Epoxidized aliphatics and glycidyl aromatics which function similarly to the metal bases by absorbing released HC1. 3 Antioxidant materials such as phosphites.The mechanism is unknown but may involve suppression of radical reactions. One or more of these stabilizers are found as additives in essentially all vinyl formulations. In unfilled, unplasticized vinyl formulations, they may constitute the largest volume additive and are usually at least the second largest in plasticized vinyls.Unlike most plasticizers which are designed to permit maximum compatibility solubility with the vinyl resin, stabilizer additives or products derived from them by acting on the vinyl resin decomposition products, possess only limited solubility in the resin matrix.Hence, they tend to migrate from the resin especially during high temperature processing. Epoxy compounds, especially those containing two or more oxirane groups, probably polymerize to less soluble polymeric materials which, in any event, have a high affinity for the metal surfaces found in molds, mills, extruders, etc. Metal soaps of fatty acids, e.g. Ba, Cd stabilizers more closely resemble mold lubricants, that is, materials which migrate to mold surfaces, than do the additives such as plasticizers which are truly compatible with the resin. Hence, such additives along with any other materials of limited compatibility such as fillers, coupling agents, glass finishes, organic pigments, waxes, etc., tend to collect on surfaces and under certain conditions lead to the phenomenon known as plate out . When plate out occurs on molds, surfaces of parts are adversely affected low gloss, and loss of detail, also parts may stick due to the mold fouling or scumming. If severe, molding operations must be shut down to permit cleaning frequently a costly and time consuming operation in an intricate mold. Surfaces of calendering rolls may be similarly coated with plate out . An especially objectional manifestation of plate out may also be found in extruders where build up may go undetected until suddenly uncontrollable resin decomposition occurs as a result of increased heat of shearing, necessitating a complete shut down of production and costing cleaning of the disassembled equipment. The extrusion of plasticized polyvinyl chloride resin compositions at elevated temperatures in the range of 1800C 2000C may, therefore, result in decomposition that is related to the amount and type of stabilizer present. Thermal decomposition may occur in the presence of substantial amounts 6 9 parts per hundred of one or more stabilizers such as cadmium, barium and tin salts, epoxy compounds, etc. Decomposition is a particular problem in the manufacture of coated wire that is made by extruding around one or more conductive cores a polyvinyl chloride resin which is plasticized with an alkyl diphenyl phosphate such as octyl diphenyl phosphate. Substitution of other known aryl phosphate plasticizers for the octyl diphenyl phosphate to reduce decomposition at elevated temperatures results in less than satisfactory low temperature flexibility. Decomposition of plasticized polyvinyl chloride resin compositions within the extruder at elevated temperatures results in rapid plating out of carbon and metallic salts on the screw and die of the extruder and requires excessive downtime. The extruder, which normally might be disassembled and cleaned once a week may become inoperative in less than 8 hours with the result that production comes to a standstill. Although plate out is a fairly common problem, we have now discovered that decomposition at extrusion temperatures, and the attendant problems caused thereby, can be avoided by employing as a plasticizer the mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions of the present invention. The differential scanning colorometer shows that the mixed phosphate esters of the present invention have a thermal stability at least 500C above similar compositions which have a substituent on the ss carbon atom of the alkyl or alkoxy radical. It is an advantage of using the mixed phosphoric acid ester composition of the present invention to plasticize polyvinyl chloride polymers that such ester compositions provide the multiple function of plasticization, flame retardance and suppression of plateout in a single highly effective additive. As an added advantage, the mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions of the instant invention yield plasticized vinyl polymers which produce low smoke values during combustion and in this respect they match the performance of alkyl phosphates. Increasing attention has been placed on the amount of smoke generated by polyvinyl chloride polymers, especially fire retardant polyvinyl chloride polymers. It is evident that even a polyvinyl chloride resin formulation having a low degree of fire hazard may create a hazard if the smoke released when the polyvinyl chloride polymer is in contact with a flame is sufficient to trap occupants in an enclosed space by obscuring their vision or hampering their ability to breath. The underwriter s laboratory has developed tests and ratings for measuring smoke evolution see U.L.E 84 Tunnel Tests and also U.L. 72 , which tests are used in evaluating 26 plasticized polyvinyl chloride polymers described below. It has been found that the novel mixed phosphoric acid ester compositions, when incorporated into a polyvinyl chloride polymer formulation in compatible amounts of about 30 to 150 parts per hundred gives good low temperature flexibility, increases the oxygen index, reduces flame spread and most important, reduces the amount of smoke generated without substantially detracting from the polyvinyl chloride polymer properties. The practice of our invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples which are presented for the purpose of illustration, not limitation, and Figures 1 25 which are gas chromatograms of the novel compositions illustrated by the examples.In the examples that follow, parts by weight bear the same relation to parts by volume as do kilograms to liters.
