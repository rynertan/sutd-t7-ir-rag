# MECHANISM FOR VARIABLY CONTROLLING AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VALVE

## Abstract
The valve operating mechanism for operating a valve on an internal combustion engine comprises an L shaped rocker arm 52 having a cam follower surface 58 on one leg 54 composed of a straight section 58a and a curved section 58b acted upon by a cam 42 on a rotatable camshaft 40 . The other leg 56 of the L shaped rocker arm 52 contacts a valve member 26, 28, 32, 38 to open the valve member, overcoming the spring closing force to do so. A lever arm 64 has one end mounted for pivotal movement about a shaft 62 providing a fixed axis, a pin 74 carried by said lever arm 64 intermediate said one end and the other end thereof providing a shiftable axis. A base circle feature is included by means of a pair of curved edges adjacent opposite sides of said straight section 58a . The curved section 58b provides an increased amount of valve opening, the curved section curving suffi ciently to provide a semi desmodromic valve operation desir able during maximum valve lift at high engine speeds.
