## Description
This invention relates generally to the selection and production of color, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for selecting a color according to color characteristics of one color classification system and reproducing the selected color in accordance with color characteristics of a different color classification system. When a beam of white light is passed through a prism, the beam is spread into a well known band of colors. The colors in the band are fully saturated colors, which are considered pure colors, and are generally referred to as the spectral hues. While the band contains a large number of hues that form a continuous spectrum, an observer perceives seven distinct hues identified as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, which appear to blend smoothly from one into another. The complete range of visible colors contains a vast number of colors in addition to the fully saturated colors or spectral hues. These additional colors can be created by combining appropriate hues in selected proportions. In practice, however, colors are created in a medium defined by a set of primary colors, with a particular color created as a mixture of the primary colors included in the set. Primary colors are selected according to their ability to create a wide range of colors in a given mixing medium. For example, in projected light media such as the common video cathode ray tube CRT display, the additive set of primaries red, green and blue RGB are often used, while in reflective media such as the common 4 color printing process, the subtractive set of primaries cyan, magenta, yellow and black are often used. As there are many mixing media, there are many sets of, mixing primaries. However, since primary sets mix colors, rather than pure spectral hues, to create other colors, no primary sets can create the complete range of visible colors. The term color gamut is used to describe the set of colors which can be created by a particular set of primary colors. In describing the 4 color printing process, black was identified as a primary of the subtractive set of primary colors. Technically, black is not a color, but is a result of the absence of color. The mixing media of the 4 color printing process utilizes black to create black and shades of colors otherwise not obtainable by mixing the actual colors included in the primaries of the subtractive set. On the other hand, black exists in an additive mixing medium when there is absence of all primaries. Similarly, white is not a color. In an additive mixing medium, white can be created by combining equal proportions of a pair or pairs of complementary colors included in the color gamut obtainable from the primary set. In subtractive mixing media, white exits when there is an absence of all primaries. While colors may be produced using alternative techniques in various media, broadly speaking, color perception is a subjective visual experience resulting from the stimulation of the retina by light. Visual sensations produced from observation of a given light vary from observer to observer, because the response characteristics of retinas vary from observer to observer. Moreover, the retina is able to distinguish only a small fraction of the colors included in the range of visible colors, and its sensitivity to color is affected markedly by the level of received light. To aid in identifying and distinguishing colors, several color classification systems have been developed to represent colors through models. Each classification system consists of a set of color characteristics, often attributes of appearance of light, used to specify different colors according to varying values of the characteristics. In some classification systems, colors are classified according to a set of primary colors, each primary of the set being a color characteristic. In these systems, the proportions of primaries determine the color. The aforedescribed CRT display and 4 color printing process are examples of color systems that produce a range of colors that can be described by models based upon such classification systems. However, such color classification systems lack subjective color characteristics colloquially used to describe color and thus are difficult to use. In other classification systems, colors are classified according to characteristics of hue, saturation and value HSV , the numeric quantities of each determining the color. These classification systems are based upon the intuitive notions of hue, saturation and value. Consequently, models of such classification systems provide a framework for classifying colors in terms of subjective color characteristics that can be dealt with more naturally. While the hue, saturation and value HSV color characteristics systems will be discussed at length in connection with the present invention, the characteristic properly designated as value will be referred to as brightness to avoid confusion with references to numeric value. Models of such color classification systems are described in Joblove, G. H. and D. Greenbert, Color Spaces for Computer Graphics , SIGGRAPH 78 Proceedings, published as Computer Graphics, 12 3 , August 1978, pp. 20 27 and Smith, A. R., Color Gamut Transform Pairs , SIGGRAPH 78 proceedings, published as Computer Graphics, 12 3 , August 1978, pp. 12 19. With respect to the various color classification systems, there generally exist mathematical transforms which provide a mapping function between different color classification systems. Such transforms are frequently useful, for they provide a means whereby corresponding color points in different color classification systems may be located. For example, a particular color specified in terms of the color characteristics of a hue, saturation and brightness color classification system can be converted to the corresponding color characteristics of a red, green and blue primary color classification system through use of the associated transform. Such a technique would naturally find a broad range of applications in dealing with color in various media. By way of example with respect to the color video CRT medium wherein color is specified in terms of relative portions of the primary colors of red, green and blue, a particular color specified in terms of the color characteristics of hue, saturation and brightness can be directly converted and displayed in the CRT medium through use of the associated transform to determine the respective amounts of red, green and blue necessary to reproduce the particular color. In a similar manner, for any color displayed in terms of the color characteristics of red, green and blue the corresponding hue, saturation and brightness color characteristics could be likewise obtained to reproduce the color. In dealing with other media for the production of color, such as printing, wherein the color characteristics may be the primaries cyan, magenta, yellow and black, the corresponding amounts for each of the primaries could be determined in a similar manner to reproduce a color specified in terms of hue, saturation and brightness color characteristics. Numerous techniques have been taken in the past with respect to the process of color selection and production. In one such technique, a user is provided with the ability to choose a particular color from a set of pre defined colors. While the set of predefined colors may be changed, the colors contained within the set are fixed during a selection process to individual and distinct colors. While the number of colors present may be large, the choice of the user is nevertheless restricted during a selection to colors which are present within the pre defined set of colors. The restriction of freedom of color choice to a group of pre defined colors is highly desirable. An example of this color selection procedure is given in Computer Design, Vol 21, July 1982, pages 155 to 163. In an alternate technique of color selection and production used in the past, color selection is achieved through the display of a set of pre defined colors along with independent displays of numeric values of hue, saturation and brightness color characteristics associated with a particular color selected from the set. In accordance with this technique, a set of individual, distinct, pre defined colors is displayed to the user along with a display of three linear lines. Each line represents numeric values associated with one color characteristic. That is, one line represents numeric values of only the hue color characteristic, a second represents numeric values of only the saturation color characteristic and the third represents numeric values of only the brightness color characteristic. Selection of a color starts with the selection of one of the displayed pre defined colors. This selection causes indications to appear in the three linear lines each independently specifying the numeric values of one of the hue, saturation and brightness color characteristics defining the selected pre defined color. Colors other than the pre defined color can be obtained by selecting different numeric values from one or more of the independently displayed numeric values of color characteristics. While the ability to select different numeric values of color characteristics does enable selection of colors in addition to the displayed pre defined colors, the independent displays of the numeric values of the color characteristics does not permit the user to observe interactions of any combinations of the color characteristics other than the final selected color resulting from the combination of all color characteristics, namely hue, saturation and brightness. Moreover, this technique does not offer to the user the ability to view all colors which are present in the color gamut. Only the set of pre defined colors and the selected color if different are displayed. The limited display of colors also fails to display any of the colors adjacent to the selected color, because the adjacent colors invariably are located in the color gamut between the selected color and pre defined colors. GB A 2117902 describes a color detection and modification system in which an operator can vary the values of characteristics in a first set, the characteristics being converted to red, green and blue characteristics and displayed for viewing on a video screen. The present invention is directed towards providing an apparatus and method for selecting a color according to color characteristics of one color classification system and reproducing the selected color in accordance with color characteristics of a different color classification system. Accordingly the invention provides apparatus for converting color defined in a first set of characteristics to color defined in a second set of characteristics, the apparatus comprising a display indicative of characteristic values in the first set, means for selecting or changing the characteristic values, means for converting the characteristic values in the first set of characteristics to values in the second set of characteristics and means for implementing the color as a function of the second set of characteristics, characterised in that the display indicative of characteristic values in the first set comprises a first display indicative of a plurality of selectable values of a first characteristic in the first set with at least one of the other characteristics held constant and a second display responsive to selection of the first characteristic indicative of a plurality of selectable values of a second characteristic in the first set. The invention also provides a method for converting color defined in a first set of characteristics to color defined in a second set of characteristics, the method comprising displaying an indication of characteristic values in the first set, selecting or changing the characteristic values, converting the characteristic values in the first set of characteristics to values in the second set of characteristics and implementing the color as a function of the second set of characteristics, characterised in that an indication of a plurality of selectable values of a first characteristic in the first set is displayed with at least one of the other characteristics held constant and in response to selection of the first characteristic an indication of a plurality of selectable values of a second characteristic in the first set is displayed. The selection process is performed in conjunction with a color display including displays for values of the first color characteristics, which in the preferred embodiment are hue, saturation and brightness, as well as the color resulting from the selection of the color characteristics. Further, the interaction of selected values of color characteristics with the range of available values of other color characteristics is displayed so that the user may observe interactions of combinations of selected values of the color characteristics, thus facilitating color selection. In the preferred embodiment, hue may be selected from a display of the entire array of system hues from which a desired hue may be selected. Either the entire range or a portion of such range of hues may be displayed at the same time, the hue display being scrolled on command to reveal all system hues when a portion of the range of systems hues are displayed. The selected hue is then reproduced on a saturation display which illustrates the entire range of saturation of the hue extending from the pure system hue to white. Each change in hue produces a resulting change in the saturation display, more readily facilitating selection of the desired saturation value of the selected hue. A brightness display may illustrate the range of brightness extending from black through the gray scale to white or, alternatively, the selected desaturated hue may be displayed at one end of the scale with the full range of brightness thereof being shown. The use of these interactive displays enables the user to alter values of each characteristics independently based on observation of the effects of such change. Through the ability to view the effects of independent changes of characteristics, considerations of subjectiveness, intuitiveness and perceptiveness of the user required to anticipate the effects of changes in characteristics when only the final result is seen can be avoided. Selection of the color characteristics, such as hue, saturation and brightness, of the color classification system for color selection provide numerical values for conversion into a set of color characteristics of a different color classification system, such as an additive or subtractive primary system, for reproduction of the color. The advantages of the apparatus and method of this invention will be more readily apparent when the following detailed specification is read in connection with the drawings wherein Referring now to the drawings, color selection and reproduction are accomplished in accordance with the present invention by apparatus and method which enable the selection of a color to be accomplished through the use of a first set of color characteristics which are displayed in a manner allowing simple and rapid human selection. Mathematical values for the selected characteristics are then transformed to a second set of color characteristics for implementation in the reproduction of the color described by the second set of characteristics. This second set of color characteristics is selected in accordance with the apparatus or mixing medium elected for reproduction of the color. A generalized system for implementation of the color selection and reproduction method of this invention is illustrated schematically in FIG. 1A, wherein a color selection controller 210 is used interactively by an operator to select the color characteristics from a first set of color characteristics in accordance with the display of such characteristics on a display 212, which is preferrably on a color monitor utilizing color CRT mixing medium based on the red, green and blue color characteristic primary system. However, any suitable color display device may be used. As will be described in detail hereinafter, the color characteristics are displayed on the monitor 212 for viewing by an operator, such that the operator may change values selected for each color characteristic independently by operation of the color selection controller 210. As the value of each characteristic is changed, the new value is used to update the display on the monitor 212 to show the effects of the change. This facilitates further adjustment of characteristics in an interactive manner. When a final color has been selected, the color selection controller 210 transforms the color from the first set of color characteristics to a second set of color characteristics for transmission to a color reproduction device 214, which may be any suitable device such as a printer, a paint mixer or a color monitor. If desired, implementation of the color could be on the same monitor used for the display 212. In the preferred embodiment, the color is selected in accordance with the characteristics of hue, saturation and brightness of a color classification system represented by the mathematical parameters H,S and V. Implementation of the color is in the red, green and blue RGB color characteristics for an additive color classification primary system, such as used in the aforedescried color television CRT medium. A model of the RGB primary system is illustrated in FIG. 2, wherein each of the primary colors red, green and blue is shown on an axis of the system, with values for the amount of each primary, or color characteristic, ranging from a minimum of zero to a maximum of one. The axes intersect at an origin 216 at which the value for each of the primaries is zero. The result of this combination of primaries is black. When all three primaries are mixed in equal quantity at their maximum values, the result is the white located at point 217 in FIG. 2. A mixture of an equal quantity of the three primaries less than their maximum values, but greater than their minimum values, produces a shade of gray, located at a point on a gray line 218 extending from point 216 to point 217. This line identifies all gradations in grays available in the color system. By mixing red, green and blue in various relative amounts, all colors available in this color classification system will be obtained. It should be noted that the color cyan can be obtained by mixing blue of a level of one with green of a level of one, with the level of red equal to zero magenta can be obtained by setting blue and red at one while green is set at zero and yellow can be obtained by setting green and red equal to one while blue is set at zero. These three colors, along with black, form a subtractive primary color classification system, such as used in the aforedescribed printing mixing medium, which is directly mathematically related to the additive RGB primary system. While primary color classification systems are highly suitable for machines, such as video displays, to produce color, they are generally unsatisfactory for human use in the selection of color. A preferred system for color selection is the HSV color classification system defined by hue, saturation and brightness color characteristics. Referring now to FIG. 3, a circular cylinder color coordinate model is illustrated for characterizing the colors in terms of hue, saturation and brightness. In this system, brightness is a linear quantity, ranging from zero brightness black at point 220 to maximum brightness white at point 222. Between these points is a line of grays 224 extending through the center of the cylinder. Hue is an angular quantity measured in degrees circumferentially around the gray line 224. Saturation is a linear quantity represented as the radius of the circular cylinder. A zero value of saturation represents a point on the gray line 224 and a maximum value of saturation represents a pure or fully saturated hue, desaturated hues being represented at radial points therebetween. By selecting a hue and designating its level of saturation along with its brightness, any one of the full range of colors within the color gamut of the system con be specified. In this cylindrical representation of an HSV system, the hues located at the circumference of the system represent pure, fully saturated hues, such as the hues found in the white light spectrum. In FIG. 3, the circumferential positions of the additive and subtractive primaries red, magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow have been illustrated, but are intended only to show specified hues for reference purposes. The array of hues is a continuum. It should be noted that any hues or colors at points in the HSV system can be mixed to create a range of other colors. For example, white and red could be blended to create a range of tints of red, or pinks, located along the line 226 in FIG. 3. Additionally, the hues green and blue could be blended to form an array of colors found along line 228 in FIG. 3. These colors can be used for blending other colors. While mathematical color classification systems may be based on pure, or fully saturated hues, true hues are not available in most real color systems. The HSV system used in the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 4, and includes only the six primary colors described hereinbefore as pure hues. Mixtures of adjacent pure hues form colors that are considered system hues . Each of the system hues along the lines extending between the pure hues is displaced radially from the circumference toward the center of the cross section of the conical color space. Thus, the saturation is less than full saturation. While the system hues are not pure in nature, they are the most saturated colors available for the corresponding pure hue in the color classification system and serve as hues for the system. For this reason, they are referred to as system hues. The HSV color characteristic system of FIG. 4, while mathematically constructed with cylindrical coordinates in the manner shown in FIG. 3, does not extend cylindrically downward but rather it converges toward a point 229 at the color black. The system is structured in this manner because as the brightness color characteristic is diminished, colors tend toward black, with colors having lower levels of saturation becoming black at higher levels of brightness. Color systems, such as color monitors, are limited to the colors that can actually be produced by the materials used. The red, green and blue primary phosphors used in color television CRT s do not produce pure hues, but only colors that are desaturated forms of pure hues. Referring to FIG. 5, points 230, 232 and 234 illustrate actual colors of red, green and blue primaries, respectively, which might be available in a color television CRT mixing medium. By combining adjacent primaries, the full range of system hues is obtained. Mixtures of green and red create the system hues depicted by the line 236 mixtures of red and blue create the system hues depicted by the line 238 and mixtures of blue and green create the system hues depicted by the line 240. By the use of the system hues, an HSV system described by FIG. 4 can be established, which in turn can be transformed or converted mathematically through suitable transforms to either a red, green, blue additive primary color classification system, a cyan, magenta, yellow and black subtractive primary color classification system, or to any other color classification system definitive of a mixing medium in which the selected colors are to be reproduced. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the selection and reproduction of color is accomplished in a computer graphics system wherein the color reproduction device 214 is a color television CRT mixing medium, and selected colors used in connection with the formation of graphics images displayed on the CRT screen are created through the illumination of red, green and blue phosphors. For other mixing media of color reproduction, a different color reproduction device 214 is used. A 4 color printing process reproduction device 214, more commonly, printer would use the cyan, magenta, yellow and black subtractive primary color classification system. The color selection controller 210 is preferably a digital computer working under the control or a program for the selection of hue, saturation and brightness values. Selected values of hues, saturation and value are stored in the computer s memory, and then are transformed to values of red, green and blue. The transformed values are held in memory to be used in producing graphics on the color CRT included in the color reproduction device 214. Color selection is performed interactively with the operator individually selecting hue, saturation and brightness from displays clearly illustrating the effects of changing each of these characteristics. The individual color characteristic displays making the display 212 are illustrated in FIG. 1B and preferably include a hue bar display 250 from which the operator may select a specific hue from the complete range of system hues, a saturation bar 252 from which the operator may view the complete saturation range of the selected hue and select a specific saturation level and a brightness bar display 254 from which the operator may view brightness values and select a desired brightness value. In addition, a current color display 256 is provided for displaying the color defined by the values of the HSV color characteristics selected by the operator, and is updated as the operator changes the selected values. In one embodiment of the present invention, the hue bar display 250 illustrates the entire range of system hues so that a single hue may be selected by the operator, thus designating a corresponding value of the hue parameter H in the HSV color characteristic system. The selected hue is designated on the hue bar display by a slide marker 258, which is preferably a vertical black line drawn at the position on the hue bar display corresponding to the selected hue. Because the operator can observe the full range of system hues, the desired hue which is closest to the color ultimately desired can readily be selected. If the entire range of system hues is displayed across the hue bar display, the slide marker 258 is moved across the hue bar display 250 to a position showing the selected hue. In another embodiment of the present invention, a portion of the range of system hues is displayed at one time in the hue bar display 252, and the slide marker 258 is maintained at a fixed position in, for example, the center of the hue bar display. The selected system hue is the one positioned beneath the slide marker 258. The portion of the range of system hues displayed is changed by scrolling the hues through the hue bar display and, by continued scrolling of the hues, the entire range of system hues can be displayed for selection. The selected hue is preferably also displayed at one end of the saturation bar display 252, which displays the entire available range of saturation of the selected hue from the selected hue at one end to white at the other end. Therefore, the saturation bar display 252 provides a display of the interaction of the selected system hue with the entire range of the saturation color characteristic, which facilitates color selection by the operator. The selection of the interacted characteristics of saturation and hue is designated on the saturation bar display 252 by the position of a slide marker 260. As in the hue bar display 250, the slide marker is preferably a vertical black line drawn at the position on the saturation bar display corresponding to the selected saturation and hue interaction. This selection necessarily results in the selection of a value for the saturation characteristic of the HSV color characteristic system. A brightness bar display 254 is provided to display the full range of brightness available in the system. In one embodiment of the present invention, brightness is displayed as a gray scale ranging from black at one end to white at the other end, with the currently selected brightness level designated on the display by a slide marker 262, preferably of the kind previously described with respect to the hue and saturation display bars 250 and 252. In another embodiment of the present invention, an interaction of the brightness characteristic with the selected desaturation hue itself an interaction of the selected hue and saturation charateristics is displayed int he brightness bar display 254. As discussed hereinbefore with reference to the saturation display bar 252, this display of interaction of the color characteristics facilitates color selection by the operator. The desaturated hue selected from the saturation bar display is displayed at one end of the brightness bar display 254 and the levels of brightness through black, with black displayed at the other end of the bar display. This selection of a brightness necessarily results in the selection of a value for the brightness perameter V of the HSV color characteristic system. The selected values of H,S and V are converted through the use of appropriate transforms to values of R, G and B in the red, green, blue primary color classification system for display in the current color display 256. Because the selected hue, saturation, brightness color characteristics and the current selected color are illustrated on the display 212 and are immediately updated whenever changes of the H,S or V values occur, the effects of each color characteristic change ore displayed to the operator in a manner that facilitates a rapid and interactive selection process. Selection of hue, saturation and value may be accomplished by any of a number of input devices which are connected to the computer and included in the color selection controller 210. If desired, selection of the desired bar display and movement of the corresponding slide marker can be accomplished through common keyboard cursor contol input. However, it is preferable to accomplish color selection by the use of a device defining an XY coordinate system which corresponds to locations on the monitor screen so that a cursor may be moved around the screen in response to action of this device to control selection of color. While many input devices, such as a joystick, trackball, light pen or mouse may be used in the preferred embodiment, a data or graphics tablet is used to establish the XY coordinate system with values thereon selected by motion of a pen thereupon. Operation of graphics tablets is well known and is performed by the motion of the pen over the surface of the tablet. In response, a cursor is moved across the screen to positions corresponding to the motion of the pen across the graphics tablet. Activation of a switch, such as by pressing the pen against the tablet, causes a set of XY coordinates to be input to the computer. By moving the pen across the graphics tablet, the cursor may be positioned in any of the bar displays 250, 252, 254 so that engaging the switch selects a value of the characteristic corresponding to the position of the cursor within the bar display. By maintaining the switch in its engaged state, the value of the characteristic may be altered to the desired value. At the same time, the modified values of the characteristic ore used to recompute the displays and provide updated visual color information to the operator. For example, in the embodiment of the present invention wherein the entire range of system hues is displayed in the hue display bar 250, by placing the cursor within the hue bar display, an operator may select a hue which will be indicated by motion of the slide marker 258 to the location of the cursor. The slide marker may then be moved with the cursor to change the selected hue. The graphics tablet and pen are similarly used to select different values of saturated hues in the saturation bar display 252 and different values of brightness in the brightness bar display 254. In the embodiment of the present invention where a portion of the entire range of systems hues is displayed, the slide marker 258 remains in a fixed position at the center of the hue bar display to designate the hue positioned under the slide marker as the selected hue moving the pen across the graphics tablet moves the cursor within the bar display causing the position of the hues to move through the display bar in a direction corresponding to the direction of movement of the pen. This scrolls the system hues through the hue bar display. As hue is scrolled, the hue bar display 252 is changed so that the full range of system hues can be shown. As the selected values of hue are changed, the saturation bar display 252 is updated to show the currently selected range of desaturated hue. If the brightness bar display is of the embodiment illustrating values of brightness of the desaturated hue, this display is updated to show the currently selected value of hue at the currently selected value of saturation. If the embodiment of brightness bar display 254 showing the gray scale from block to white is used, this display is unchanged. In either event, the color corresponding to the currently selected values of H, S and V is shown in the current color display 256.

Broadly speaking, such two dimensional information would represent data information for use with various programs executed by computational means 84. Information bus 86 provides for the coupling of information between computational means 84 and terminal 80 and graphics tablet 138. In particular, information bus 86 provides for the flow of information from computational means 84 and display device 134 of terminal 80, and for the flow of information from keyboard device 136 and graphics tablet 138 to computational means 84. Storage device 88 provides for the permanent storage of information used in connection with computational means 84, and may be further used to store information present in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110, as will be more fully discussed hereinafter.

Display device 132 provides a visual display responsive to information from RGB composite output generator 124. Broadly stated, the operation of the foregoing may be described as follows. Each pixel in a visual display has associated therewith three storage locations, each containing the respective amount of a particular primary color necessary to reproduce the color associated with the pixel. The respective amounts for the color of red for each pixel in the display are stored in storage locations in memory storage device 106. In a similar fashion, the respective amounts for the colors of green and blue for each pixel are stored in storage locations in memory storage devices 108 and 110. Consequently, the storage locations in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 collectively contain the respective amounts of the colors red, green and blue necessary to reproduce a color visual display. Digital to analog converters 112, 114 and 116 operate to convert the format of the information stored in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 from a digital to an analog format suitable for input to RGB composite output generator 124. In particular, pursuant to control information from frame store controller 92, the information in storage locations in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 associated with each pixel is supplied to digital to analog converters 112, 114 and 116. Digital to analog converters 112, 114 and 116 thereafter convert the information from a digital format as supplied from memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 to an analog format, and thereafter present the information to RGB composite output generator 124. RGB composite output generator 124, pursuant to information received from digital to analog converters 112, 114 and 116 and control information received from frame store controller 92 over control bus 104, produces an appropriate signal to drive display device 132. Display device 132, in response to the foregoing information from RGB composite output generator 124, produces the color visual display. It is consequently observed that the contents of the storage locations in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 will determine the visual information displayed. In addition to the foregoing, frame store controller 92, pursuant to information from computational means 84, may direct the storage of information provided by computational means 84 in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110. Consequently, the contents of a visual display can be directly controlled by computational means 84. In particular, computational means 84 could through coupling bus 94 specify the desired contents of each storage location in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 to frame store controller 92. Thereafter, frame store controller 92 would direct the storage of said information in the respective storage locations in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110. Consequently, while frame store controller 92 provides for the continuous display of information contained in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 through digital to analog converters 112, 114 and 116, RGB composite output generator 124 and display device 132, frame store controller 92 may also access the contents of memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 pursuant to communications with computational means 84 to direct the storage of information therein. In addition thereto, computational means 84 can determine the current contents of any storage location in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110. In particular, frame store controller 92, pursuant to instructions from computational means 84, would locate the contents of particlular storage locations in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110, and thereafter would provide access to the information by computational means 84. Thereafter the information with respect to the contents of storage location in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 could either be used in computations performed by computation means 84, or stored for subsequent use in storage device 88.

Referring to Figures 8 and 10, computational means 84 would perform the steps previously discussed with respect to blocks 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134 and 136. In particular, computational means would determine the selected value for H from either terminal 80 or graphics tablet 82. In this regard, there are various methods which may be employed in the process of describing a particular color, including an interactive technique wherein a user may select a color from the array of colors which are displayed by display device 132.

The particular storage locations wherein the foregoing information would be stored would depend upon the particular location on the resulting display wherein said information was desired to be displayed. In further accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, the foregoing described apparatus would provide for the display of the array of colors resulting from the mixing of each of the colors appearing the the array of spectral hues with portions of the colors of white and black in the following manner. Referring to Figures 9 and 10, computational means 84 would perform the steps previously discussed with respect to blocks 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158 and 160. Thereafter, the results of the calculations performed in block 144 would be stored in storage locations in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110, pursuant to control functions of frame store controller 92. The particular storage locations wherein the foregoing information would be stored would depend upon the particular location on the resulting display wherein said information was desired to be displayed. In addition to the foregoing, in accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, the foregoing described apparatus provides for the interactive specification and changing of a color by a user of the apparatus, as more fully described in Figure 11. Referring to Figure 11, the values of H, S and V are initially assigned the values of 0, 1 and 1 respectively in block 140. Thereafter in block 142, the spectral hues are displayed as more fully discussed with reference to Figures 5 and 10. Thereafter, in block 144 a particular hue is selected by a user from the array of spectral hues displayed by block 142. The selection of a particular hue will define a particular value for the variable H. Thereafter in block 146 the array of colors which result from the mixing of the selected hue with various portions of the color white is determined, as more fully previously discussed with reference to Figures 6 and 10. Thereafter in block 148 the array of colors which result from the mixing of the the selected hue with various portions of the color of block is determined in block 148, as more fully previously discussed with reference to Figures 7 and 10. Consequentially as a result of the foregoing, there is displayed the array of spectral hues, the array of desaturated colors associated with a particular hue chosen from the array of spectral hues, and the array of colors which result from the mixing of the selected hue with portions of the color black. Thereafter in block 152 a determination is made if the user has changed the value associated with S, i.e., has specified a different value of saturation. If the user has changed the value of S, then the foregoing process is repeated from block 148. If the user has not changed the value of S, then in block 154 a determination is made if the user has changed the value associated with H, i.e., has specified a different spectral color. If the user has specified a different spectral color, then the foregoing process is repeated from block 146. If the user has not changed the value of S, then a determination is made if the user desires to exit from the foregoing procedure in block 156. If the user does not desire to exit from the foregoing procedure, then the foregoing is repeated from block 150, otherwise the foregoing procedure is terminated. In accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, a user may specify or change a particular color in an interactive manner in the following manner. Referring to Figures 11 and 10, computational means 84 would perform the steps previously discussed with respect to blocks 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 148, 150, 152 and 154. In particular, computational means 84 would determine the selected value of H and any changes in the values of S or V from either terminal 80 or graphics tablet 82. In this regard, there are various methods which may be employed in this process, including an interactive technique wherein a user may specify a parameter in terms of the display associated with display device 132. Notwithstanding the particular technique employed in the process of specifying a value for a parameter, the results of the calculations performed in blocks 142, 146 and 148 would be stored in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110, pursuant to control functions of frame store controller 92. The particular storage locations wherein the foregoing information would be stored would depend upon the particular location on the resulting display wherein said information was desired to be displayed. In addition to the foregoing, in accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, a color may be specified in the RGB color space, and the particular components thereof in the HSV color space determined. Thereafter, parameters which are associated with the color may be changed, and the color resulting therefrom displayed. Referring to Figure 10, color camera 96 provides for the specification of a color. In particular, a color which is provided to the foregoing apparatus by color camera 96 is converted from an analog to a digital format by frame store controller 92. Thereafter, frame store controller 92 would provide for the storage of the color in memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110. Thereafter, computational means 84 would, pursuant to instructions from a user entered by terminal 80, interrogate the contents of memory storage devices 106, 108 and 110 to determine the respective RGB components of the color, and thereafter perform the conversion to the corresponding HSV values through the use of the Figure 11 illustrates a method for the interactive specification of parameters associated with a color. Figs. 7A and 7B illustrate flow charts of programs executed by the computer included in the computation means 84 for generating the hue bar displays. Fig. 7A illustrates the flow chart of the program for generating a hue bar display capable of simultaneously displaying the full range of system hues. Referring to Figure 7A, the variables of H, S and V are initially assigned the values of 0, 1 and 1 respectively in block 80. Thereafter, an incrementing value is assigned to the variable delta H in block 82. The variable delta H is used to increment the value of the variable H in a subsequent incrementing process. In practice, the value chosen for delta H will be dependent upon the particular application, and determined in part by the the smallest perceivable difference in spectral hues possible in a particular medium. Thereafter, the Fig. 7B illustrates the flow chart of the program for generating a hue bar display similar to Fig. 7A, but which is limited in display range, and thus displays the full range of system hues, a portion at a time. In further accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, a particular color may be selected from the array of spectral hues, and the colors which result from the addition of the color of white thereto may be determined and displayed in the RGB color space. Figure 6 illustrates the foregoing. Referring to Figure 6, a particular numeric hue value is first identified from the array of spectral hues in block 90. The selection of a particular color will define a particular value for the variable H. Thereafter, the variables S and V are assigned the value of 0 in block 92. In block 94 an incrementing value is assigned to the variable delta S. The variable delta S is used to increment the value of the variable S in the subsequent incrementing process. In practice, the value chosen for delta S will be dependent upon the particular application, and determined in part by the smallest difference in saturation which can be perceived in a particular medium. Thereafter in block 96 the corresponding values in the RGB color space are determined for the current values of the variables H, S and V. Thereafter in block 98 the current value of the variable S is checked to determine if the maximum value for the variable S has been exceeded. If the maximum value for the variable S has not been exceeded, then the variable S is incremented in block 100, and the process repeated from block 96. If the value for the variable S is greater than the maximum value, then the process is complete, and the colors corresponding to the mixing of the selected color with the color white over the range of values from 0 to 100 in increments of delta S have been determined in the RGB color space. Figs 9A and 9B illustrate flow charts of programs executed by the computer included in the computation means 84 for generating brightness bar displays. Fig. 9A illustrates the flow chart of the program for generating a brightness bar display which displays the full range of brightness extending from black to white. Referring to Figure 7, a particular color is first selected in block 102 from the array of colors produced in accordance with the procedure discussed with reference to Figure 6. The selection of a particular color would define particular values for the variables of H and S. Thereafter the value of 1 is assigned to a variable V in block 104. Thereafter a value is assigned to the variable delta V in block 106. The variable delta V is used to decrement the value of the variable V in the subsequent decrementing process. In practice, the value chosen for delta V will be dependent upon the particular application, and determined in part by the smallest difference in brightness which can be perceived in a particular medium. Thereafter the corresponding values in the RGB color space are determined for the current values of H, S and V in block 108 through the use of the In a similar manner, Fig 9B illustrates the flow chart of the program for generating a brightness bar display which displays the full range of brightness extending from black to the currently selected desaturated hue. In further accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, a particular color may be selected from the array of spectral hues, and the colors which result from the mixing of the selected color with portions of the colors white and black may be determined and displayed in the RGB color space. Figure 8 illustrates the process. Referring to Figure 8, a particular color is first selected from the array of spectral hues in block 120. Thereafter, the value of 1 is assigned to the variables of S and V in block 122. Thereafter values are assigned to the variables delta S and delta V in block 124, as previously discussed with reference to Figures 6 and 7. Next, the corresponding values for R, G and B are determined for the current values of H, S and V through the use of the In yet further accordance with the method and apparatus of the present invention, all colors present within a particular color gamut may be determined and displayed in the RGB color space. Figure 9 illustrates the process. Referring to Figure 9, the variables of H, S and V are initially assigned the values of 0, 1 and 1 respectively in block 140. Thereafter in block 142, a value is assigned to a variable delta H. The variable delta H is used to increment the value of the variable H in a subsequent incrementing process. In practice, the value chosen for delta H will be dependent upon the particular application, and determined in part by the smallest difference which may be perceived between spectral hues in a particular medium. In a similar manner values are assigned to the variables delta S and delta V, as previously discussed. Thereafter in block 144 the corresponding values for the variables R, G and B are determined from the current values of H, S and V through the use of the The routine used in the preferred embodiment of the present invention to perform the conversion from the HSV color space to the RGB color space, i.e., the In a similar fashion, a color specified in the RGB color space may be likewise specified in terms of the HSV color space. Such a procedure is used in the process of determining the particular components of a color in terms of the parameters of H, S and V and thereafter displaying the colors which result from changes in any of said parameters. The routine used in the preferred embodiment to perform the conversion from RGB color space to HSV color space, i.e., the RGB HSV conversion routine, is given in Table 2. Broadly stated, a black and white picture may be reproduced by dividing the surface area thereof up into a large number of individual areas, and assigning a particular brightness to each of the individual areas. The sharpness of the resulting picture would of course be determined by the number of individual areas chosen the larger the number of individual areas, the greater the sharpness of the resulting picture. The term picture element, or pixel is generally used to refer to the individual picture elements. For a black and white picture, each pixel contained therein would have a value for brightness associated therewith. In a similar manner, a color picture may be defined by a large number of individual points contained therein, each point having a particular color associated therewith. From the foregoing, it is clear that with respect to the video medium, a picture may be produced by dividing a screen on a cathode ray tube up into a large number of pixels, and thereafter assigning individual values to each such pixel. In particular, for a color picture to be produced in such a system employing the the primary colors of red, green and blue, i.e. using three different types of phosphors which respectively emit light having a color of red, green and blue, each pixel would in have a color associated therewith defined in terms of the amount of the colors of red, green and blue required to be mixed to produce the desired color associated with the particular pixel. Consequently, a color picture may be defined by a large number of pixels, each of which having unique values for each of the respective primary colors of red, green and blue associated therewith.
