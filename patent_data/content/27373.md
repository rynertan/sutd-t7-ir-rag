# Raster input scanner including at least one array of image viewing elements adjustably mounted on a support.

## Abstract
Array adjusting apparatus for a raster scanner with scanning arrays 40, 41 supported by displaceable blocks 106, 108 . The blocks are supported against a spring bias 132 on members 116, 117, screws 120 permitting the members 116, 117 to be moved to raise and lower arrays 40, 41 and thereby adjust the height of the arrays within the optical system 55 59 . A side member 140 permits, through screw 120 , adjustment of the array position in the optical path along the horizontal. Screw members 152, 154 enable adjustment of the array focus, with pivot means 174 permitting pivoting of the array to bring the array into perpendicular relationship with the optical path.
