# Vertical roller mill.

## Abstract
In a vertical roller mill, a grinding roller 3 is urged against a grinding path on a grinding table 1 by an hydraulic cylinder 9 . The loading on the roller is measured by a transducer 18 and the acceleration of the roller by an accelerometer 19 . Resulting signals are combined at a controller 23 which controls a valve 11 through which hydraulic fluid is supplied to the cylinder, so that the loading is compensated for the influence of the instantaneous velocity and acceleration of the roller.
