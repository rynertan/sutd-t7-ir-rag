## Description
Grapple harvesterThis invention relates to a felling and processing unit,which comprises cross cutting members for felling and cross cutting trees, limbing members for limbing felled trees, driven feed rolls for feeding a felled tree through the unit for processing the tree, and suspension means for suspending the unit hingedly on a forest crane boomFelling units suspended on a forest crane boom, and also processing units are known previously. Heretofore, however, one has not succeeded in producing a combined felling and processing unit, which suspended on a crane boom renders it possible to fell and process trees in a sequence, and which permits maximum utilization of the reach of conventional forest cranes which normally is about 10 m.Experiments carried out for producing such a unit only have resulted in constructions, which are much too heavy for the forest cranes normally employed for felling units, grapples a.s.o., and which by their weight would substantially limit the reach of the crane. This has been deemed unacceptable, especially for thinning units for which, instead, the greatest possible reach is desired.The present invention, therefore, has the object to produce a grapple harvester to be suspended on a forest crane, more precisely a felling and processing unit of simple construction and designed so as suspended on a forest crane boom to render possible the felling and processing of trees, and the weight of which is so low that the entire reach of the forest crane can be utilized efficiently. This obJect is achieved in that the unit according to the invention has been given the characterizing features defined in the claims.The invention is. described in greater detail in the following, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. is a lateral view of a combined felling and processing unit according to the invention applied about a tree and in position for felling the same, Fig. 2 is on an enlarged scale a section substantially along the line II II in Fig.1, Fig. 3 is a section substantially along the line III III in Fig. 1, Fig. 4 is a section substantially along the line IV IV in Fig. 1, Fig. 5 5 is a schematic view illustrating the suspension of the cross cutting member shown in Fig. 4 seen from the side, Fig. 6 is a lateral view of a unit according to the invention which is provided with a modified embodiment of the suspension means of the feed rolls, Fig.7 is a section substantially along the line VII VII in Fig. 6, and Fig. รง is a section substantially along the line VIII WIII in Fig. 6 and illustrates a slightly modified embodiment of the mechanism for the feeding movement of the cross cutting member.The combined felling and processing unit or the grapple harvester according to the present invention is intended to be carried by a forest crane mounted on a vehicle and is shown in Fig. 1 hingedly suspended at the end of a forest crane boom, of which only a portion is shown, via a hydraulically operated rotator 2 for rotating the felling and processing unit relative to the boom 1. At other embodiments, however, this rotator 2 can be replaced by another link or hinge connection, which permits rotation of the unit relative to the boom 1.The felling and processing unit comprises a suspension arm 3, which at one end is hingedly connected to the rotator 2 and at its other end is hingedly connected to the body 4 of the felling and processing unit by means of a hinge 5, which permits the body 4 to pivot at least through 900 and preferably more than 180 in relation to the suspension arm 3, and which preferably should be located closer to the body end facing to the ground than to the other end of the body, in the starting or felling position shown in Fig. 1. For returning the unit to said felling position after it had been pivoted outward from the suspension arm 3, i.e. after the felling and processing of a tree, springs not shown in detail in the drawings are provided which may be torsion springs in the hinge 5 and or tension springs attached between the suspension arm 3 and body 4.The spring force in the outward pivoted position of the body is adjusted so that the springs are capable to return the unit to the felling position only when the unit is not loaded, i.e. when it does not carry any tree material.The body 4 consists of a centrally located hollow beam 6, at the upper portion of which, i.e. the portion remote from the ground, a stationary, substantially flat V shaped limbing knife 7 is exchangeably attached. Connected to the hallow beam 6 and laterally projecting therefrom are frame beams 8, at which movable limbing knives 9 are arranged in different planes between the stationary limbing knife 7 and the frame beams 8. The upper movable limbing knife is designated in Fig. 1 by 9a, and the lower one by 9b. The movable limbing knives 9, more precisely, are attached exchangeably each on a carrier arm 10, which are connected to or formed with an axle 12 rotatably supported in a bearing holder 13 on the frame beam 8. A swinging arm 13 formed at one end as a fork is connected non rotary to each axle 12 and projects in a direction opposed to the carrying arm 10.Between the swinging arm 13 and the hollow beam 6, for every movable limbing knife 9 a hydraulic cylinder 14 is provided for operating the respective movable limbing knife 9. The movable limbing knives 9 also act as grapple members, which subsequent to the application of the unit to the tree to be felled are capable to grab about the tree and thereby draw the unit to the tree in question. The carrier arms 10 supporting the limbing knives 9 rest slidably against supports 15, which are arranged on the upper surface of the frame beam and located between the respective limbing knife 9 and the bearing point of its carrier arm and relatively close to the end of the respective frame beam. The supports 15, thus, take up and transfer a substantial part of the forces arising during the limbing operation on the frame beams 8.At the end of each frame beam 8 a rocker arm 17 is pivotally mounted by means of a pin 16, at the other end of which arm a drive roll 19 provided with a hydraulic rotary motor 19a of its own is attached by means of a pin 18. Between the ends of every rocker arm a link 20 is hingedly attached which at its other end is hingedly connected to a sleeve 21 located movably on the hollow beam 6 of the body. For moving the sleeve, a preferably double acting hydraulic cylinder 22 is provided. Upon movement of the sleeve 21 in the direction marked by the arrow 23 in Fig. 1 the rocker arms 17 are swung about their pins 16 in the direction to each other, and thereby the drive or feed rolls 19 are applied to the stem with equal force and each with a force so directed, that it presses the stem inward against the body of the unit.Hereby also the stem is prevented effectively from disengaging with the drive rolls 19 applied to the stem.In order to obtain this safe engagement, each pin 16 is arranged so as to form an acute angle of the magnitude 30 60 , preferably 450, to the plane extending through the hollow beam 6 of the body and designated by 24 in Figs. 2 and 3, while the axis of rotation 25 of the associated drive roll forms a less acute angle, for example 10 20 , preferably 150, to said plane 24 than the associated pin 16. The drive rolls 19 hereby always are applied to the stem part remote from the body, irrespective of the tree diameter, as also appears from Fig. 3. The stem thereby is pressed against the body of the unit. The movable limbing knives 9 as well as the drive rolls 19 are arranged symmetrically in relation to said plane 24, so that upon application or attachment of the unit to a tree to be felled and limbed the unit is centered relative to the tree, and its centre will be located substantially in said plane 24, as also is shown in Fig. 3. By suspending the drive rolls near the supports 15 for the carrier arms 10 of the limbing knives, the forces produced by the drive rolls at the feeding of a tree stem to a great extent will balance the forces caused by the limbing knives. It is hereby gained that the body can be designed more slender and thereby be given a lighter weight than otherwise would be the case. The body 4 of the unit also comprises a casing or box beam 26 attached to the hollow beam 6, in which box beam a crosscutting member of the unit is located for felling a grabbed tree and cross cutting the same to intended lengths, and in which a support roll 27 is provided in said plane 24, and by which the unit is held in abutment to the stem being in the unit. The cross cutting member is shown in the Figures in the form of a saw guide bar 28 with a saw chain 30 driven by a hydraulic motor 29. The guide bar 28 is capable,for cross cutting a tree,to be swung out of the box beam 26.More precisely, at the embodiment shown by way of example in Figs. 4 and 5,the guide bar 28 with its motor 29 is connected to a transverse piece or plate 31, which is supported by two link arms 32 and 33, which are pivotally attached to the box beam. The link arm 33 consists of a single arm located beneath the guide bar 28 and rotatably attached on a pin 33a connected to the box beam 26 and a pin 33b connected to the plate 31. The link arm 32 consists of two parts, one located on the same level as the link arm 33, and the other part located above the motor 29. Said two parts are attached rotatably on a pin 32a connected to the box beam and on a pin 32b connected to the plate 31, as shown in Fig. 5.Of said link arms 32,33 one is hingedly connected to a hydraulic cylinder 54 hingedly connected to the box beam 26 for swinging the guide bar outward for cutting off a tree, which outward swinging movement preferably is so controlled by means of pressure scanning transducers or the like, that the guide bar is returned to the starting position protected in the box beam 26, as shown in Fig. 4, directly after the tree has been sawn off, which is scanned by the pressure scanning member, because the necessary feeding pressure thereby decreases.The link arms 32 and 33 supporting the plate 31, on which the saw guide bar is attached, are of equal length and their joints 32b,33b at the plate 31 are located on both sides of the guide bar 28ataApaced relationship which is equal to or greater than the distance between the joints 32a.32b of the link arms at the box beam 26. By this arrangement is achieved that the guide bar carries out a very favourable fedding movement with a relatively small angular displacement of the guide bar, and at the same time the feeding force exerted by the hydraulic cylinder 34 is at its greatest where it is required. In other words, the guide bar is arranged so that during its feeding movement it moves along an arcuate path, and at the same time is rotated through a predetermined angle in the direction of movement, i.e. counterclockwise in Fig.4, and preferably so that the guide bar forms a substantially right angle with the vertical plane designated by 24 when it is in that portion of the arcuate path which is located closest to said plane 24. By such a feeding movement it is prevented to the greatest possible extent that the guide bar is jammed even in cases when the crane is not capable to lift the tree being felled.The feeding movement of this guide bar can be effected also in many ways other than that shown in Figs. 4 and 5, for example by means of guide rails or grooves formed in agreement with the arcuate path. It also is possible within the scope of the present invention to position the guide bar pivotal about a fixed point, for example about the point designated in Fig. 4 by 40.In Fig. 8 a slightly modified embodiment of the feeding mechanism of the cross cutting member is shown which differs from the mechanism described above only In that the link arm 33 has curved shape, and that the piston cylinder device 34 at one end is hingedly attached to the joint 22b of the link arm at the plate 31 and at its other end is hingedly connected to the box beam 26 substantially closer to the hollow beam 6 and support roll 27 than at the embodiment according toFig. 4.At the embodiment according to Figs. 6 and 7 the feed rolls or drive rolls 19 of the unit, each provided with a drive motor, are suspended in the same way as the drive rolls at the embodiment according to Figs. 1 3 each at a rocker arm 17, which arms are mounted pivotally each at the end of a frame beam 8 by means of pins 16, which are retained in place by means of securing plates screwn on the respective frame beam 8. The two feed rolls are suspended identically and, therefore, only one feed roll 19 and its suspension is shownFigs. 6 and 7.Between the ends of each rocker arm 17 a link 43 is attached pivotally by means of a pin 42, which link in its turn is hingedly connected to a guide arm 5 by means of a pin 44.Said arm 45 is pivotally mounted at its end remote from the link 43 on a pin 46, which is located at the end of a projection 47, which projects from the stand of the unit, for example from its hollow beam 6, and is rigidly connected therewith. A link arm 48 is hingedly attached to the guide arm 45 between the ends thereof by means of a pin 49 extending through the guide arm 45 and the fork shaped end of the link arm, which end straddles the guide arm 48. The link arm 48 is at its other end pivotally mounted on a pin 50, which is located at the end of a projection 51, which projects from the sleeve 21 movable by means of the piston cylinder device 22 on the hollow beam 6 and is rigidly connected to the sleeve.This projection 51, like the projection 47, has such a length and extension that their pins 50 and 46 are in parallel with each other and with the remaining pins 16,42,44 and 49 and are located in the same vertical plane, in which plane also the remaining pins are located as well as the link arm 48, guide arm 45, link 43 and rocker arm 17. The projection 51 further carries its pin 50 on about the same level as the attachment point of the piston cylinder device at the sleeve 21 and substantially aligned with said attachment point, as is shown more clearly above all in Fig. 7. The pins can be held in place by means of screwn securing plates 41, see pin 16, or by means of bolt and washer, as shown e.g. for the pins 46 and 50. In a similar way also the other feed roll 19 of the unit, which roll is not shown in Figs. 6 and 7, is suspended at the opposed side of the unit, and due to the fact,that the projections 51 carrying the link arms 48 via the pins 50 and connected to the sleeve 21 are arranged symmetrically in relation to the attachment point of the piston cylinder device at the sleeve 21, forces arising are distributed uniformly and thereby minimize the risk of pinching.Upon upward movement of the sleeve 21, thus the link arms 48 cause the guide arms 49 to pivot about their pins 46, and thereby the rocker arms 17 are caused via the links 43 to move the feed rolls to engagement with the tree stem and to apply the feed rolls against the stem with equal force and each with a force so directed that it presses the stem inward against the body of the unit. Hereby also the stem is prevented effectively from disengaging the applied feed rolls 19. At this embodiment the rotation axls of the feed rolls has the same angle to the plane 24 in Figs. 2 and 3 as at the embodiment according to Figs. 1 3, but the pivot pins 16,42,84,49,46,50 are arranged at an angle of 600 to said plane. Other angles, of course, can be imagined without abandoning the invention idea. The unit according to the invention operates as follows.In the starting position the body is held in the position shown in Fig. 1. The unit can thereby be applied upright to a tree to be felled, after the unit by means of the rotator 2 had been turned so that the desired felling direction has been obtained. The unit is applied first with its stationary limbing knife 7 to the tree, whereafter the movable limbing knives 9 are pivoted inward and against the tree for drawing the unit inward against the tree. After the unit has been lowered to a suitable level, the drive rolls 17 are applied to the tree. The saw chain 30 can then be started and the guide bar 28be swung outward for separating the tree from the stump.In order to prevent pinching in this connection, the crane boom 1 can be lifted whereby the pivot point 5 is subjected to an upward directed force, which gives rise to a tilting moment in the predetermined felling direction of the tree. The saw cut is thereby so widened that pinching cannot occur. When the tree has been sawn through completely, the necessary feed pressure decreases, which is scanned by the said pressure scanning transducers, which thereby attend to that the guide bar 28 immediately is returned to the starting position in the casing 26.Due to the tilting moment applied in the aforesaid way, the tree is caused to fall in the intended felling direction, and as the unit is pivotal relative to the suspension arm 3, the unit follows along with the tree.The tree thus felled, if desired, can be drawn to the machine whereafter the drive rolls are started for feeding the stem through the unit and thereby delimbing the same. The support roll 27, against which the stem is held pressed both by the drive rolls 19 and the limbing knives 9, and which, thus, is caused to rotate at the feeding of the stem, preferably is provided with a measuring mechanism, which indicates when the feed is to be stopped for cross cutting the stem to the desired length by means of the guide bar 28. After the crosscutting and the return of the guide bar to the starting position, the drive rolls 19 again are started for advancing a further length. This is repeated until the tree is entirely processed. As soon as the tree top has left the unit, the unit is swung upward by the springs not shown to the position shown in Fig. 1, and the unit is ready for being applied to the next tree to be felled.The present invention is not restricted to the embodiments described above and shown in the drawings, but can be altered and modified in many different ways within the scope of the invention idea defined in the attached claims.
