## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the formation of linework or halftone multicolour colloid patterns.The production of linework or halftone multicolour colloid patterns is of interest in the field of design, e.g. in the production of colour decorative patterns, colour wiring and circuit diagrams, cartography, colour proofing and the preparation of transparencies for projection, optionally opaque prints for overhead projection. Especially in the colour field of the graphic art there is a great need for a simple and fast technique offering colour proofs of high quality and reproducibility. Photographically produced colour proofs are a substitute for multicolour halftone reproductions as will be produced by successive printing in register with the separate standard inks magenta, yellow, cyan and black on a conventional printing press. A process for the production of colour proofs by preparing a printing plate and running the plate on the press to produce only a few copies as proof of the quality of the halftone separation transparencies used in the exposure is a very expensive procedure and therefore photographic processes have been developed to obtain a similar result by means of which the appearance of a print starting from particular colour separation negatives or positives can be judged by the printer and client. According to a process known from US P 3,642,474 the production of such a proof in the form of superposed coloured colloid patterns, proceeds with hydrophilic coloured colloid layers, which are hardened in the irradiated portion by means of an active species formed during or after the informationwise exposure to active electromagnetic radiation of a photosensitive substance, and comprises the following steps In said process for producing a multicolour pattern the exposures proceed in register on the same permanent support which received the unexposed coloured hardenable colloid layers by transfer from a temporary support, each transfer and exposure being followed by hardening development, wash off processing and a drying step before a next transfer and exposure leading to a further selection colour pattern can be carried out. In the above process for the production of colour proofs the imagewise exposure proceeds in a vacuum frame with the particular separation negative of the multicolour pattern to be reproduced in contact with the coloured colloid layer on the permanent support. In US P 3,364,024 a photographic process is described for obtaining a photographic resist image by the transfer of certain diffusing gelatin insolubilizing oxidized developing agents from a developing silver halide emulsion layer to a separate non silver halide containing gelatin layer thereby imagewise insolubilizing therein the gelatin.. According to an embodiment the silver halide emulsion layer during development is contacted with a pigmented gelatin layer on a separate support for a time sufficient for the oxidation products of the developer to harden the gelatin imagewise. When unhardened portions are removed by wash off processing, a pigmented relief image remains. Tanning developing agents useful for said process are for example, 1,4 dihydroxy benzene compounds such as hydroquinone, chlorohydroquinone, bromohydroquinone, toluhydroquinone and morpholine methyl hydroquinone.In the graphic art field an increasing proportion of colour work is now made on colour scanners. Colour scanners operate with a rotating scanner drum and in many instances with a laser light source of a definite narrow spectral composition. Therefore, scanningwise exposure requires photographic materials with a specific photosensitivity. Moreover, in order to have an economic use of the scanner the sequence of exposure and processing steps has to be such that the scanner can operate without interruptions. According to the basic principles of a colour scanner a light spot from a non modulated light source inside or outside a rotating drum is used to expose in transmission or reflection an original attached to the drum. The light beam of the spot modulated by the original is picked up by three photocells after passing through red, green and blue filters respectively. The amounts of red, green and blue light, and the resulting photocell responses, represent the colour of the original at this point. A computer operates on these signals to calculate the light output of the light source, e.g. argon ion laser light source, for the exposure of the proper photographic film in the production of the cyan, magenta, yellow and black colour selection. Scanning exposure is inherently time consuming, e.g. takes up to about 10 minutes for a single DIN A4 size selection being scanned at 140 lines per cm. The preparation of overlay colour proofs by scanningwise exposure on separate supports starting from non transferable pigmented silver halide gelatin coatings is described in US P 4,427,757 but yields inferior results because of poor whites due to the inherent light absorption of the plurality of overlaying supports and the disturbing light reflection obtained on each interlaying support. The above sequence of processing steps as defined in US P 3,642,474 is not practical and is time consuming when for the imagewise exposures a scanner is used. Indeed, the above process is less suited to be combined with scanner exposure from the viewpoint of sensitivity, convenience and rapid accessibility to the final multicolour reproduction because the scanner is not occupied full time. Each scanning operation would be interrupted by a wet hardening development, a wash off processing and drying of a freshly transferred coloured colloid layer. Since a scanner operates with fairly poor light output and with limited spectral composition when a laser light source is used, it is not possible to operate with poorly photosensitive photographic materials such as those based on the UV sensitive iron III complexes described in the already mentioned US P 3,642,474. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the formation of a line or halftone multicolour colloid pattern wherein the scanningwise exposure of several pigment free photographic silver halide emulsion materials proceeds on a scanner without interruption by processing steps and to use said photographic materials in the production of said multicolour colloid pattern in conjunction with separate coloured non lightsensitive materials. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a colour proofing process wherein a multicolour proof and the formation of black and white selection negatives or positives proceeds in a same procedure, said selection images being suited for serving as originals in the exposure of photosensitive printing plates. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become clear from the further description. In accordance with the present invention the process for forming a line or halftone multicolour colloid pattern comprises the following steps By a single scan operation is understood that the exposure of all the photographic materials used in the multicolour print production proceeds on the same scanner drum by arranging the materials on the drum in adjacent order and effecting the scanning without interrupting the rotation of the drum. The gelatin of the hardenable coloured layers used according to the present invention is preferably mainly unhardened gelatin as described in US P 3,364,024. According to a preferred embodiment in the transfer of the hardenable coloured gelatin containing layer from a temporary support onto a permanent support a permanent support is used that is less hydrophobic than the temporary support. The transfer proceeds by pressing the permanent support in the presence of an aqueous liquid against the hardenable non photosensitive gelatin containing layer and removing the temporary support, thus leaving the hardenable gelatin containing layer on said permanent support. According to a modification of the present process the first of said hardenable non photosensitive coloured gelatin layers is not transferred from a temporary support but has been applied directly on a permanent support and thereon a first coloured relief image is formed and eventually the other coloured patterns are formed starting with coloured gelatin colloid layers being originally present on a temporary support. In the present process the best results from the viewpoint of image sharpness are obtained by effecting the scanning wise exposure of the light sensitive silver halide material from the front side. Such requires, however, a reverse reading exposure to obtain after transfer of oxidized developing agent right reading copies. In modern scanner exposure apparatus such does not form a problem since the computer software allows electronic image reversing without special optics such as mirrors and the like. According to a particular embodiment the present process is carried out with photographic materials comprising on a resin film support, a silver halide emulsion layer incorporating in a hardened or unhardened gelatin binder a silver halide tanning developing agent and photosensitive silver halide grains. When applying the process according to the present invention including the steps 3 and 4 the top layer of the wash off processable composition on the temporary support contains preferably dispersed in the hardenable hydrophilic colloid a substance being a pressure and or heat sensitive adhesive, e.g. a thermoplastic polymer in latex form, improving the surface tack by applying pressure and or heat. Such substances are described, e.g. in US P 4,033,770, which for these substances has to be read in conjunction herewith. The process of the present invention can be applied so as to offer the advantage of producing in one and the same procedure selection negatives or positives in the form of the developed black and white photographic materials and a corresponding multicolour proof corresponding therewith. These selection negatives or positives are suited for use as intermediate originals in the exposure of photo resist printing plates forming the actual monochrome printing forms. For the production of high quality black and white selection images the gelatin binder of the silver halide emulsion layer is preferably overall hardened but to an extent still allowing the diffusion of oxidized hardening developing agent out of said layer. In the production of superposed multicolour colloid patterns the coloured substances used in the hardenable colloid layers have to be resistant to diffusion and chemically inert in the processing and washing liquid s as much as possible. When being used in colour proofing they have to match with the absorption spectrum of the standard process inks as close as possible. Particulars about standard colour inks can be found in H.M.Cartwright Ilford Graphic Arts Manual 1962 VoL. I pages 502 to 504. There exist cold and warm colour standards. Cold colour tones are, e.g. standardized in the U.S.A. in the GATF Colour Charts and in the German Standards DIN 16508 and 16509. Warm colour tones are standardized, e.g. in the German Standard DIN 16538. The cold colour standards are characterized by the use of substantially pure magenta dyes, mostly insolubilized rhodamine and phloxine dyes, which have a very low side absorption in the blue region of the spectrum. The warm colour standards are characterized by the use of insolubilized azo dyestuffs. Said dyestuffs are more resistant to solvents, e.g. alcohol, than the rhodamines and phloxines, but they possess a much higher side absorption in the blue region of the spectrum.It has been found experimentally that pigments, which are insoluble or very poorly soluble in water and in organic liquids of the alcohol or polyhydric alcohol type, e.g. glycerol, fulfil the requirements of resistance to diffusion. Dyes in pigment form that are applied from an aqueous dispersion are used preferably, though the use of substantive dyes, i.e. chemically reactive dyes, that are chemically linked to the hardenable colloid is not excluded. For colour proofing purposes the hardenable colloid layer should preferably contain coloured substances in a concentration sufficiently high for obtaining an optical density of at least 0.35 in the wavelength range of maximum absorption. The coloured substances may have all kind of colour, e.g. are cyan, light cyan, magenta, warm magenta, black, yellow, green, brown, orange, red, white or blue. Considered are likewise metallic colours such as pale gold, rich gold, copper, and silver. In other words the term colour in the present invention encompasses all pure and mixed colours as well as black and white. Non migratory pigments suitable for use in the present invention are known organic pigments, e.g. those obtainable under the Trade Marks PIGMOSOL and COLANYL dyes. PIGMOSOL and COLANYL are organic pigments that are mixed with a dispersing agent for an aqueous medium. These pigments excel in resistance to light, heat, acids, bases, oxidizing agents, and solvents. They are insoluble in hydrophilic colloids such as gelatin. When in addition to the cyan, magenta and yellow relief patterns a black relief pattern is formed in colour proofing, preferably carbon black is used. Apart from carbon black mixtures of coloured pigments may be applied as described e.g. in US P 4,427,757. According to a special embodiment in order to avoid a direct contact of the coloured substances with the permanent support the coloured coating on the temporary support is over coated with a hydrophilic colloid layer top layer , which is not coloured, i.e. does not contain pigments or dyes for forming the image. On transfer of such composite coating the top layer comes into contact with the permanent support and is sandwiched between said support and the coloured coating. The top layer may contain the same colloid s as the coloured layer. The top layer, however, may contain small amounts of translucent pigments, e.g. silica particles, protruding from the layer and being a few microns thicker than the top layer. They avoid sticking of rolled up sheet material at relatively high e.g. 60 relative humidity. The top layer contains, e.g., 0.2 to 1.5 g of gelatin per sq.m. In order to obtain images with a good resolution, relatively thin coloured colloid coatings are preferred. Preferably they have a thickness in the range of 1 um and 15 um. Good results are obtained with coloured colloid layers containing 1 to 10 g of gelatin per sq.m. Very good results are obtained with colloid layers having a combined thickness of 1 to 5 um and containing 0.5 to 3 g of gelatin per sq.m. The colloid layers preferably contain at least 50 by weight of gelatin. The adhering power of each transferable coating or composite coating to its temporary support, preferably a flexible one, should be such that an easy stripping off from the temporary support is possible after pressing the pigment coating into contact with the permanent support. Therefore, a relatively hydrophobic temporary support e.g. an unsubbed cellulose triacetate sheet, a polystyrene sheet, a polyester sheet, or sheet of copoly vinyl acetate vinylchloride and a permanent support having a hydrophilic surface, e.g. a polyethylene terephthalate support subbed for adhering gelatin coatings is used preferably e.g. a hydrophobic support subbed as described in the United Kingdom Patent Specification 1,234,755. According to an embodiment the coloured hardenable coating is composed in such a way that its adherence to the temporary support in wet state is less than in dry state. This can be attained by the addition of hygroscopic agents, e.g. a water soluble organic hygroscopic compound e.g. glycerol, and the use of wetting and plasticizing agents. Other temporary supports having a repelling power for wet gelatin coatings are, e.g., a paper base coated with a polyethylene layer, a paper base impregnated with wax, a paper base coated with a layer of cellulose nitrate or a paper base coated with a layer of insolubilized polyvinyl alcohol or a layer of alginic acid insolubilized with an alkaline earth metal salt. The permanent support may be rigid or flexible and only must present by itself or by means of a subbing layer s a good adherence in wet as well as in dry state for the transferable hydrophilic colloid coating or relief portions thereof. Depending on the use of the multicolour print the permanent support is transparent, translucent or opaque. So, it is possible to use metal layers or sheets, glass, ceramics, resin supports and paper impermeabilized for the processing and washing liquids. For purposes such as colour proofing wherein three or more transfers have to be effected in register it is necessary to use a resin support with high dimensional stability. Resin supports characterized by a high mechanical strength and very low water absorption and consequently high dimensional stability in dry and wet state can be formed from a linear polyester, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate. Good results as to dimensional stability are obtained with aluminium sheets sandwiched between two high wetstrength paper sheets although this material is rather expensive. Permanent resin supports can be made opaque by coating them with a matted subbing layer or by matting or colouring them in the mass. The matting may be effected by pigments known therefor in the art, e.g. titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and barium sulphate. Matting can also be obtained by producing a blushcoat as described e.g. in United Kingdom Patent Specification 943,681. Hydrophobic resin supports to be used as permanent support according to the present invention are coated with one or more subbing layers for a gelatin containing layer. Preferred subbing layers for use on a permanent hydrophobic resin support, e.g. a polyethylene terephthalate support, are described in the aforementioned United Kingdom Patent Specification 1,234,755. The photosensitive silver halide used in the photographic materials applied in the present invention may comprise silver chloride, silver bromide, silver bromoiodide, silver chlorobromoiodide and the like, or mixtures thereof. The silver halide emulsions may be coarse or fine grain and can be prepared by any of the well known procedures, e.g., single jet emulsions, double jet emulsions, such as Lippmann emulsions, ammoniacal emulsions, thiocyanate or thioether ripened emulsions such as those described in U.S. Patent Specifications 2,222,264 of Adolph H. Nietz and Frederick J. Russell, issued November 19, 1940, 3,320,069 of Bernard D. Illingsworth, issued May 16, 1967, and 3,271,157 of Clarence E. McBride, issued September 6, 1966. Surface image emulsions may be used or internal image emulsions may be used such as those described in U.S. Patent Specifications 2,592,250 of Edward Philip Davey and Edward Bowes Knott, issued April 8, 1952, 3,206,313 of Henry D. Porter, Thomas H. James and Wesley G. Lowe, issued September 14, 1965, and 3,447,927 of Robert E. Bacon and Jean F.Barbier, issued June 3, 1969. The emulsions may be regular grain emulsions such as the type described by Klein and Moisar in J. Photogr. Sci., Vol. 12, No. 5, Sept. Oct. 1964, pp. 242 251. If desired, mixtures of surface and internal image emulsions may be used as described in U.S. Patent Specification 2,996,382 of George W. Luckey and John C. Hoppe, issued August 15, 1961. In the production of black and white selection negatives or positives preferably silver halide emulsion materials are used that can yield high contrast line or screen images with so called lith developers on the basis of hydroquinone as described e.g. in US P 3,972,719 and 4,081,280. The photographic materials used in conjunction with a lith developer comprise preferably at least 50 mole of silver chloride, the balance, if any, being bromide and optionally minor amounts of iodide less than 5 mole . Apart from negative working silver halide emulsions that are preferred for their high light sensitivity, direct positive silver halide emulsions may be used that produce a positive silver image and a corresponding imagewise distribution of developing agent oxidation products during their development. For example those direct positive silver halide emulsions are considered wherein by exposure or by a chemical treatment a developable fog has been produced, which is destroyed imagewise during the imagewise exposure when certain conditions are fulfilled. In the unexposed areas the fog is maintained so that during the subsequent development a direct positive silver image is obtained and in correspondence therewith an imagewise distribution of oxidized hardening developing agent. For example, direct positive emulsions of the type described in P.J.Hillson, U.S. Patent 3,062,651, may be utilized to obtain direct positive images. In emulsions of this type, a nonhardening fogging agent such as stannous chloride, formamidine sulfinic acid, or the like is used.More details about composition, preparation and coating of silver halide emulsions are described, e.g., in Product Licensing Index, Vol. 92, December 1971, publication 9232, p. 107 109. The emulsions can be chemically sensitized, e.g. by adding sulphur containing compounds, e.g. allyl isothiocyanate, allyl thiourea, sodium thiosulphate and the like, during the chemical ripening stage. Also reducing agents, e.g. the tin compounds described in the Belgian Patent Specifications 493,464 and 568,687, and polyamines such as diethylenetriamine or derivatives of aminomethane sulphonic acid, e.g. according to the Belgian Patent Specification 547,323, can be used as chemical sensitizers. Other suitable chemical sensitizers are noble metals and noble metal compounds such as gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium. This method of chemical sensitization has been described in the article of R. KOSLOWSKY, Z. Wiss. Photogr. Photophys. Photochem. 46, 65 72 1951 . Further it is possible to sensitize the emulsions with polyalkylene oxide derivatives, e.g. with polyethylene oxide having a molecular weight between 1000 and 20,000, or with condensation products of alkylene oxides and aliphatic alcohols, glycols, cyclic dehydration products of hexitols, alkylsubstituted phenols, aliphatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic amines, aliphatic diamines and amides. The condensation products have a molecular weight of at least 700, preferably of more than 1000. For obtaining special effects these sensitizers of course can be combined with each other as described in Belgian Patent Specification 537,278 filed April 12, 1955 and UK Patent Specification 727,982. The silver halide emulsions may contain the usual stabilizers, e.g. homopolar or salt like compounds of mercury with aromatic or heterocyclic rings such as mercaptotriazoles, simple mercury salts, sulphonium mercury double salts and other mercury compounds. Other suitable stabilizers are azaindenes, preferably tetra or penta azaindenes, especially those substituted with hydroxyl or amino groups. Compounds of this kind are described by BIRR in Z. Wiss. Photogr. Photophys. Photochem. 47,, 2 27 1952 . Still other suitable sensitizers are amount others heterocyclic mercapto compounds, e.g. phenylmercaptotetrazole, quaternary benzothiazole derivatives, benzotriazole and the like. The spectral photosensitivity of the silver halide has to be compatible with the spectral composition of the scanning writing light and for a proper spectral sensitization the usual mono or polymethine dyes such as acidic or basic cyanines, hemicyanines, oxonols, hemioxonols, styryl dyes or others, also tri or polynuclear methine dyes, e.g. rhodacyanines or neocyanines may be used. Such spectral sensitizers are described, e.g., by F.M. HAMER in The Cyanine Dyes and Related Compounds 1964 Interscience Publishers, John Wiley Sons, New York. The hardening development proceeds with commonly used hardening developing agents, also called tanning developing agents for effecting the development of the silver halide and producing oxidized developing agent acting as hardening agent for the hydrophilic colloid binder such as gelatin. Examples of suitable hardening developing agents are 1,4 dihydroxy benzene compounds such as hydroquinone, chlorohydroquinone, bromohydroquinone, toluhydroquinone, morpholinemethyl hydroquinone, sulfohydroquinone and the like. The developing agent may be incorporated in the silver halide emulsion material in the silver halide emulsion layer or in a non silver halide containing layer adjacent thereto and or in the non photosensitive hardenable pigment containing gelatin binder layer so that development can be attained by using an alkaline activator liquid. According to a special embodiment the layer containing photosensitive silver halide is combined with an adjacent hydrophilic colloid layer containing an auxiliary developing agent forming a superadditive developing system with the hardening developing agent that is incorporated in the silver halide emulsion layer. Typical activator baths for a hardening developable photographic silver halide emulsion material comprise, for example, an aqueous solution of an alkaline material, such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, mixtures of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfite, etc. A suitable activator bath comprises e.g. about 2 percent by weight of sodium hydroxide and 0.5 percent by weight of sodium sulfite. It will be appreciated that an auxiliary developing agent can be used along with a hydroquinone developing agent in order to improve the speed without disadvantageously affecting the wash off processing of the invention. Typical auxiliary developing agents include 3 pyrazolidinone developing agents, e.g. 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidinone, 1 phenyl 4,4 dimethyl 3 pyrazolidinone, 1 phenyl 4 methyl 4 hydroxymethyl 3 pyrazolidinone and N methyl p aminophenol sulphate. Said auxiliary developing agents or a mixture thereof may be incorporated in the photographic material and or in the non photosensitive hardenable pigment containing gelatin binder layer and or in the developing liquid in which the hardening developing agent may be absent when using an alkaline activator bath. The hardening development and the simultaneous transfer of oxidized hardening developing agent from the exposed photographic material into the hardenable coloured layer may proceed advantageously in a common silver complex diffusion transfer reversal DTR apparatus, wherein after moistening the photographic material with developer or activator liquid the contacting with the hardenable material, that serves as receiving material for the oxidized hardening developer, proceeds between rollers. Such apparatus is commercially available under the trade name COPYPROOF of Agfa Gevaert NV. Belgium. A detailed description is hereinafter set forth of a composition and structure of a non photosensitive material containing a pigmented hardenable gelatin containing layer used in the production of a multicolour image according to the present invention. A coating composition is prepared containing gelatin dissolved in water wherein a selected pigment s is are dispersed in a concentration to yield after coating and drying a layer having an optical density in the wavelength range of maximal absorption of at least 0.4. The coating composition contains preferably at least 50 by weight of gelatin in respect of the pigment particles and a proper amount of plasticizing agent and a waterattracting compound, e.g. glycerol to give the coating a sufficient adherence to its temporary support and to enable its easy wet aqueous stripping off from the temporary support, e.g. an unsubbed cellulose triacetate or polyethylene terephthalate support. The coating contains preferably 0.5 to 10 g of gelatin per sq.m. A second coating, the so called top layer, the composition of which is identical to the foregoing, except that no pigment s are present, is coated on te first one. The second coating contains preferably 0.2 to 5 g of gelatin per sq.m. The second coating forms with the underlying pigmented coating one hardenable double layer firmly bound together, in other words a composite layer which can be transferred as a whole from the temporary support to the permanent support. A set of materials each containing such a composite layer is preferably used for preparing a multicolour colour proofing image . A usual set contains yellow, magenta, cyan, and black pigment coatings on separate cellulose triacetate supports. The permanent support, e.g. a polyethylene terephthalate support, is successively coated with a first subbing layer on the basis of a copolymer containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic structural units in a suitable ratio and a second subbing layer, which is more hydrophilic than the first one and contains gelatin, a hydrophobic latex polymer and a white pigment, e.g. titanium dioxide particles, for conferring an opaque aspect to the support. The preparation of a multicolour colour proof then proceeds according to an embodiment as follows. To said permanent support subbed as described above a cyan composite layer is transferred by pressing the surface of the subbing layer of the permanent support into contact with the composite layer in the presence of an aqueous liquid and peeling off the temporary cellulose triacetate support. The transfer can be carried out in an apparatus, in which the materials involved are pressed together between rollers. An apparatus particularly suitable for use in transferring a hydrophilic colloid layer from a temporary support to a permanent support comprises a pair of co operating pressure rollers and means for driving said rollers, a first platform for supporting the wetted permanent support prior to its engagement by said pressure rollers, said platform in order to reduce frictional contact having a corrugated structure to make discontinuous contact with the permanent support when this is placed thereon, a second platform arranged over and separated from the first surface for supporting at least the leading part of the temporary support to keep said temporary support separated from the wetted permanent support when this is located on the first platform, the forward ends of both said platforms being disposed proximate to the nip of the pressure rollers so that the supports as they are advanced are gripped by said rollers and progressively pressed together. Before arriving on said first platform the permanent support is wetted with an aqueous liquid, preferably plain water. The transfer of oxidized developing agent into the coloured materials proceeds normally within a contact time of 15 to 60 s in a temperature range of 18 to 25 C. Wash off of non hardened portions proceeds without mechanical rubbing by means of running water at a temperature preferably between 30 and 50 C. Excess of liquid is preferably removed by squeezing the relief between two smooth soft rollers, e.g. rubber rollers. In successive order the same steps are carried out for the yellow, magenta, and black pigmented composite layers, which prior to their imagewise hardening by imagewise reception of oxidized developing agent in register from their corresponding photographic material, are transferred onto the same permanent support carrying already the cyan pigment resist. However, the order wherein the colour relief images are made can be chosen arbitrarily. In a particular case of four colour printing the cyan composite layer is first applied to the permanent support and is wash off processed after the imagewise transfer therein of oxidized hardening developing agent from a developing black and white silver halide emulsion material that had been scanningwise exposed by the red filter information of the multicolour original. The permanent support carrying the first relief image the cyan relief image is pressed between rollers while in contact with another coloured composite layer, e.g. the yellow one, and after a few seconds of contact the temporary support is peeled off, thus overall transferring the yellow composite layer on the cyan part relief image produced already. The obtained multilayer colloid pattern can be protected by a transparent resin topcoat, which according to a preferred embodiment is applied by spraying. A suitable spray cover consists of polyisobutyl methacrylate. The production of a multicolour proof is illustrated in more detail in the following examples. The percentages are by weight if not otherwise indicated. The photographic material contained on a film support a hardened gelatin silver halide emulsion layer covered by a protective layer incorporating a hardening developing agent. The silver halide emulsion layer was applied to a subbed polyester support at a silver halide coverage equivalent with 4 g of silver per sq.m and a gelatin coverage of 3 g per sq.m. It contained silver chloride bromide iodide grains 97.8 2 0.2 mole made spectrally sensitive to 488 nm argon ion laser light. The protective layer was a gelatin layer hardened with formaldehyde containing per sq.m 0.9 g of gelatin and 0.035 g of hydroquinone. On separate temporary supports of unsubbed cellulose triacetate having a thickness of 0.1 mm the following coloured gelatin containing layers i , ii , iii and iv were applied. i a cyan pigment gelatin binder layer containing 0.2 g of glycerol as softening agent and FLEXONYL BLUE C.I. Index Nr. 74,160 as cyan pigment in order to obtain a spectral density of about 1.4 in the red region of the visible spectrum. The gelatin coverage was 1.4 g per sq.m. Magenta ii , yellow iii and black iv pigment coatings were applied as defined for the cyan pigmented coating above. The magenta pigment was HELIOECHTCARMIN BB TEIG Colour Index Nr. 12,485 and the yellow pigment was HELIOECHTGELB GRN 7476 Colour Index Nr. 21,100 . Said pigments were used each in an amount sufficient to obtain a spectral density of about 1.4 in their main spectral absorption range. In the black pigment coating carbon black was used to reach an optical density of 1.6. The scanningwise exposure of the photographic material proceeded on a commercial scanner operating with an argon ion laser source emitting at 488 nm. Four pieces of the photographic material having DIN A4 format were adjacently arranged on the scanner drum, so that in a single step all the materials were exposed without stopping the rotation of the drum. The cyan pigment coating was transferred from its temporary support onto a permanent support of subbed polyethylene terephthalate as described in US P 3,642,474. The transfer proceeded by soaking the permanent support in water for 30 s and then pressing it into contact with the cyan pigment gelatin binder layer of i . By stripping apart the temporary support the cyan pigment layer i was left on the permanent support. In the exposed state the first photographic material exposed to the cyan selection information was contacted with the aqueous alkaline developing liquid as described hereinafter in order to develop said scanningwise exposed photographic material. The developing photographic material was contacted for 30 s at 20 C between pressure rollers with the cyan pigment coating which had been transferred from its temporary support onto the permanent support of subbed polyethylene terephthalate. To obtain a cyan coloured relief image the hardened cyan pigment layer was wash off processed with a warm 35 C water spray. The relief image was dried. Transfer, hardening and wash off processing proceeded for the other pigmented layers in the same way after the transfer from their temporary support to the same permanent support. Said transfer was carried out onto an already previously formed coloured hardened gelatin relief. Example 1 was repeated with the difference that the following lith developer described in US P 4,081,280 was used to improve the optical density of the screened selection negatives.
