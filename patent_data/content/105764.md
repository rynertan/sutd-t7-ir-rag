# Improved brake valve.

## Abstract
A brake valve, more particularly a dual concentric brake valve for controlling the pressure in primary and secondary circuits, such that the pressure in the two circuits is matched by a balancing piston 11 responsive to differential pressure between the two circuits and through which is an exhaust passage for the release of fluid from the primary circuit. A restriction which is variable by movement of the valve actuating member 22 provides a resistance to the flow of fluid from the primary circuit except in the absence of an input load transmitted from the brake pedal to the actuating member. The restriction creates a lag in the response of the vehicle brakes to a reduction in pedal load so that oscillatory feedback, arising for example, due to cab nod in large commercial vehicles, is largely prevented.

## Description
IMPROVED BRAKE VALVE This invention relates to a vehicle brake valve for controlling the fluid pressure in a fluid brake circuit. In a vehicle braking system a problem which has been encountered is feedback from the vehicle to the driver and hence to the brake control pedal or lever, resulting in a low frequency oscillation in braking effort. This is particularly relevant to large commercial vehicles in which the bodywork, specifically the cab, has a relatively high centre of gravity and may be independently suspended on the vehicle chassis. Retardation of the vehicle causes the canto tilt forwardly with the result that the driver, having applied pressure to the pedal finds it difficult to maintain the desired pressure as the brakes take effect. The problem may arise if the pedal is mounted relative to the chassis rather than the bodywork, or if the characteristics of the driver s seat cause an unwanted reaction to the braking effect.In an air brake system such oscillation between pressurisation and exhaust of the system has the side effect of depleting the pressurised air reservoir. It is an object of this invention to remove or reduce such oscillatory feedback. The invention provides a vehicle brake valve having a restriction arranged to restrict the flow of fluid from the brake circuit. The restriction is coupled to a valve actuating member, which may be for example connected directly to the brake pedal linkage, so that in the case of a pressurised air system the escape of air from the system to an exhaust outlet is limited provided the brake pedal remains at least partly depressed. Such a restriction has the effect of putting a degree of lag in the response of the vehicle brakes to a reduction in pedal force, with the result that the oscillatory feedback effect is largely prevented. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the valve is a dual concentric valve such as described in our earlier British Patent specification No. 1,466,296, for controlling the pressure in a primary and secondary circuit. The pressure in the two circuits is matched by a balancing piston responsive to differential pressure between the two circuits. In this valve, the fluid air is exhausted from the primary circuit via a central passage in the balancing piston, and it is this passage which is partly blocked by a plunger to restrict the escape of fluid from the primary circuit whilst the brake pedal is depressed. The flow of pressurised fluid from a reservoir to the system on application of the brakes is not restricted, so that the speed and progression with which the brakes respond to applied force on the pedal is substantially unaffected.Action of the balancing piston ensures that the comparatively slow release of pressure in the primary circuit caused by the restriction is matched in the secondary circuit. The restrictor plunger does not limit the release of fluid from the system when the brake pedal is fully released. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a sectioned side elevation of a dual concentric brake valve for controlling the pressure of air in the primary and secondary braking circuits of a vehicle and Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but of a dual concentric brake valve having a modified restriction. Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings the valve has a primary inlet port 20A and a secondary inlet port 20B, both of which are normally connected to a reservoir.A primary output port 21A and second output port 21B are provided for connection to primary and secondary brake circuits respectively, and an exhaust passage 3 communicates with an exhaust elbow 4. In operation, depression of the valve actuating member 22 in response to movement of a brake pedal not shown causes the carrier 5 to move downwardly due to the fitted load of the travel spring 6. This brings the exhaust seats 2 into contact with their respective seats 8. The extension restrictor 9 attached to the input plunger, by screw thread means 10 enters the centre balance piston 11 exhaust passage 3. Typically, the clearance between the external diameter of the extension restrictor 9 and the bore of the exhaust passage 3, is of the order of 0.010 ins. which provides a restricti onto the flow of fluid through the exhaust passage approximately equivalent to a 3mm diameter orifice. Further movement downwards will simultaneously open the primary and secondary inlet valves 12 and pressurise the output ports.As this travel increases the exhaust restrict or 9 penetrates deeper into the balance piston exhaust passage 3, so that by virtue of flow losses the resistance to flow increases with greater penetration. On partial removal of the input load the inlet valves will seat and the exhaust valves will open, releasing the required amount of air. However, the time taken to obtain release now depends on the release orifice available, and how far the restrictor has penetrated the exhaust passageway 3. The size and shape of the restrictor plunger may be varied to adjust the clearance and depth of penentration to obtain a required release characteristic. It should be noted that as the output pressure is increased the degree of restriction i.e. resistance to flow is correspondingly increased. As air is removed more slowly from the primary valve, the balance piston 11 will tend to move downwards due to air pressure imbalance, so as to cause a corresponding restriction at the secondary valve exhaust seat. An 11011 ring 14 is fitted around the exhaust restrictor which provides a dual purpose a To prevent exhaust blow back to the spring chamber b to provide negative hysteresis in the brake valve output pressure characteristic. Since the restrictor 9 is coupled to the actuating member 22, the restrictor 9 is withdrawn from the passage 3 when the brake pedal is fully released to avoid any delay in brake release when braking is no longer required. A second and preferred embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 2, is also a dual concentric brake valve but has a restrictor 9 in the form of a tube.The tubular restrictor 9 is secured to the input plunger by screw thread means 10. Two rectangular windows 24 are formed in the tube walls diametrically opposite one another and are disposed, axially of the tube, such that in the retracted position shown, an upper Fart 26 of each window is exposed i.e. projects out of the exhaust passage or bore 3 through the centre of the balancing piston so providing, via the windows 24, the bore of the tubular restrictor and the exhaust passage 3, an exhaust flowpath which is substantially unrestricted je.equivalent to an 8mm orifice or greater. As shown in Figure 2, even in the retracted position, the tubular restrictor 9 is located and centred within the exhaust passage. Movement of the restrictor is therefore guided so avoiding problems due to any misalignment that might occur when, as in the embodiment of Figure 1, the restrictor engages the exhaust passage upon application of the input load. When the brake pedal is depressed so that the actuating member, and tubular restrictor move downwardly from the retracted position, the exposed window 24 area is reduced, eventually to zero, so confining the exhaust flow to the annular clearance space which as in the embodiment of Figure 1 is preferably approximately equivalent to a 3 mm. diameter orifice although it will be understood that the restriction may vary depending upon the requirement of a particular application. The greater the penetration of the tubular restrictor the greater the length of the clearance flow path to the windows 24 so that, further movement of the actuating member produces an increasing resistance to any exhaust flow.
