# Indicating system.

## Abstract
An indicating system is constructed of first and second voltage comparators 10, 13 , first and second output circuits 12, 15 which are respectively supplied with output signals of the first and second voltage comparators, and first and second indicating elements 21, 22 which are connected to a common output terminal of the first and second output circuits. A first input terminal of the first voltage comparator is supplied with a first reference voltage V1 , and a second input terminal thereof is supplied with a control signal VCONT . A first input terminal of the second voltage comparator is supplied with a second reference voltage V2 , and a second input terminal thereof is supplied with the control signal VCONT . When the voltage level of the control signal VCONT is higher than the first reference voltage V1 , the first output circuit 12 causes a current of a first polarity to flow to the common output terminal. As a result, the first indicating element 21 is lit up and the second indicating element 22 is put out. When the voltage level of the control signal VCONT is lower than the second reference voltage V2 , the second output circuit 15 causes a current of a second polarity to flow to the common output terminal. As a result, the first indicating element 21 is put out, and the second indicating element 22 is lit up. When the voltage level of the control signal VCONT is intermediate between the first and second reference voltages V1, V2 the first and second indicating elements 21, 22 are put out.
