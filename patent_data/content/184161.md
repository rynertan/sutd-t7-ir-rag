# PROCESS AND APPARATUS USED FOR PHOTO SETTING A MASTER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF STAMPS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for producing by photo setting a master for the production of stamps or the like of a suitably test like image set along generally straight base line whereby the image is geometrically transformed via a substantially curved mirror surface 12 of a transparent rod like body. Said mirror surface 12 is forming an inclined angle in relation to said image, so that the master will comprise the corresponding image in a distorted curved form. According to the invention the image in the form of one or several character lines set on an at least partially transparent material is applied at a transparent part 11 of the circumference of the said body and suitably along support line extending around the body. The character line is illuminated from the outside and the distorted image reflected through said body via the suitably conical mirror surface 12 towards the end plane 14 of said body is reproduced, whereafter said reproduction is treated with photometric methods to form a master for the production of stamps or alike.
