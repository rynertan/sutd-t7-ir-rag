## Description
This invention relates to a process for recovering valuable metals such as zinc, iron and the like from an iron dust containing zinc therein such as the one generated in an electric arc furnace for steel manufacture or the like. A dust generated in an iron and or steel melting furnace such as the electric arc one is collected by means of a dust collector. The amount of the dust generated normally corresponds to 1 to 1.5 by weight of the crude steel manufactured, and the dust contains 25 to 30 by weight of iron, 20 to 25 by weight of zinc and 3 to 4 by weight of lead therein. The present situation is, however, such that it is to be subject to a collective treatment by specific refiners to whom the dust generated is handed over due to unavailability of a proper and easy recovering method thereof which can be operated on a simple and small scale. Several methods have been proposed such as a rotary kiln method and also lately, a treating method using plasma heat. FR A 1 544 303 discloses a method for treating metal containing dust and mud where the dust or mud is formed into nodules by mixing it with water, solid reductants and fluxes. The nodules are transferred to a shaft furnace for drying. Reduction and melting of the charge are achieved in a conventional way. The volatile zinc and lead are condensed and caught up in a filter. US A 3 756 804 discloses a method similar to the one of FR A 1 544 303 but with a two zones shaft furnace. The upper section is used for preheating, while the lower is used for reduction of the flue dust during grinding or thereafter. The pellets are not melted during the process. These methods, however, have drawbacks such as the complexity of process, high operation costs or the like. Therefore, this invention has been completed, taking into consideration such circumstances. One object of this invention is to provide a process for recovering easily and economically valuable metals from an iron dust with a high concentration of zinc. A further object of the invention is to provide a process for recovering valuable metals from said iron dust, which comprises pelletizing the dust into pellets, removing in advance the loss on ignition and solid carbonaceous materials in the pellets at the preheating step, charging the resulting pellets into an induction furnace together with an additional carbonaceous solid reductant to melt and reduce, and separating zinc by means of vaporization, iron and lead by means of the difference of the respective specific gravities. A further object of the invention is to provide a process for recovering valuable metals from said dust by prereducing said pellets under the conditions of gas so as to prereduce iron oxide selectively, but control the reduction of zinc practically at zero level after the preheating, thereby the consumption of energy needed in the process can be reduced to a considerable extent. Further objects of this invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention. FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2 are illustrative examples of the flow charts of apparatuses for the process for recovering valuable metals from a zinc containing iron dust according to this invention. Particularly, FIGURE 2 is the flow chart for a preferred embodiment of this invention. FIGURE 3 shows a diagram for the conditions of gas to be charged into a prereducing zone in a shaft type furnace 2 in FIGURE 2. The region shown by hatching illustrates the most preferred conditions for gas for the preheating and prereducing step of this invention, which is surrounded by the equilibrium curves of ZnO CO Zn CO₂, C CO₂ 2CO and FeO CO Fe CO₂ when the pressure of zinc and those of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are set up at 0.02 and 0.98 atmospheric pressures, respectively. However, for a purpose of simplifying the matter, other gas components expected in the practical case were omitted in this diagram. The figures and symbols used in FIGURE 1 to FIGURE 2 are This process for recovering valuable metals from an iron dust containing zinc at a high concentration therein comprises a pelletizing the dust into pellets with a pelletizer 1 , b preheating the pellets in a shaft type furnace 2 for drying them, removing the loss on ignition and burning solid carbonaceous materials in the pellets to remove the materials by means of a hot gas charged from a furnace 8 , whereby the subsequent bursting of pellets can be prevented c charging the resulting pellets into an induction furnace 3 together with an additional carbonaceous solid reductant, d melting and reducing iron oxide, zinc oxide and lead oxide contained in said pellets in the induction furnace 3 with said solid reductant, whereby reduced zinc and a part of reduced lead are vaporized, e separating zinc and lead in a gaseous state by vaporization, condensing them by a condenser 5 to obtain crude zinc and lead, and f separating iron and lead by means of the difference of their specific gravities to obtain molten pig iron and crude lead in the induction furnace 3 , respectively. Thus, the valuable metals such as iron, zinc, lead and the like are recovered easily with a lower energy consumption. If a shaft type furnace consisting of two zones one is installed in the upper part, and the other is installed in the lower part is employed, this process can be carried out more efficiently, thereby the valuable metals are obtained more efficiently. That is, the pellets are charged into the shaft type furnace having said two zones, and the charged pellets are dried and preheated in the preheating zone in the upper part, and the preheated pellets are going down naturally and then prereduced in the prereducing zone in the lower part by means of the exhaust gas from an induction furnace 3. Especially, the conditions of gas in the prereducing zone is regulated by the ratio of CO₂ to CO at a combustion furnace 8 so as to control the reduction of zinc oxide as low as possible but prereduce iron oxide selectively. After the prereducing process is over, thus treated pellets are charged together with an additional carbonaceous solid reductant to the induction furnace and zinc, iron and lead are recovered in the same manner as described above. As a pelletizer, any type of the pelletizers can be used as far as it can manufacture pellets having a size of 6 15 mm. However, a pan type or a drum type pelletizer is usually employed. A proper amount of water is added to the dust during a process. Normally, the amount of water to be added should be regulated in such a range that the water content in the pelletilized dust is approximately 8 to 10 by weight. The best mode of this process wherein the preheating and prereducing step is employed will be elucidated as follows. A preheating including drying of pellets and prereducing furnace, any type of shaft type furnaces having two tuyeres can be employed. The temperature of the hot gas to be charged into the preheating and prereducing furnace is 800 to 1,000 C. Additionally, this process can be carried out more economically if the conditions of gas to be charged into the preheating and prereducing furnace are controlled within the region shown by hatching which are surrounded by each equilibrium curve of FeO CO Fe CO₂, C CO₂ 2CO and ZnO CO Zn CO₂. In this process, the reducing gas generated in the induction furnace is also recycled to generate the hot gas for preheating and prereducing step in the shaft type furnace, in the way as shown in FIGURE 2. For this purpose, the reducing gas is partially burnt in the furnace. An oxygen gas enriched air may be used therefor as required. As a representative example of a carbonaceous solid reductant, coke can be given, however, an equivalent thereof can be also used. Zinc is separated and recovered by vaporizing it, taking advantage of its easily vaporizable nature at a relatively lower temperature due to its lower boiling point sending zinc in a gaseous state together with the reducing gas to a condenser in which zinc is condensed. In case of iron and lead, they are separated by using the difference of the specific gravities in the molten state in the induction furnace and recovered as molten pig iron and crude lead, respectively. Thus, this invention has the following advantages Particularly, the following advantages are also attained in the case that the preheating and prereducing step is employed in the process If the reduction of charged materials is carried out only in the induction furnace, an excess gas will be generated in a considerable amount. If, as is embodied by the invention, the gas generated in the induction furnace is used as gaseous reductant in the lower part of the shaft furnace to prereduce said pellets prior to charging them into the induction furnace, and further the gas used for said prereduction of the pellets is burnt in the upper part of the shaft type furnace by introducing combustion air from outside to preheat the pellets beforehand, thereby not only the effective utilization of excess gas is achieved, but also the gas generation in the furnace itself is decreased. The process according to this invention is illustrated by the following Examples, but is not limited thereto. The dust collected in an electric furnace was pelletized into pellets having a size of 6 15 mm by a pelletizer 1. Thus obtained pellets were charged into a shaft type furnace 2, dried and preheated therein by a hot gas having a temperature of 800 to 1000 C. Water contained in the pellets was removed at the upper part of the furnace, and then the loss on ignition was also removed at the lower part while going down to the bottom of the furnace. At the same time, the solid carbonaceous materials contained in the pellets were burnt and removed as well. As a result, the combustion of the carbonaceous materials was used for preheating. As the preheated pellets were charged into a lower frequency induction furnace 3 together with coke C, zinc oxide, iron oxide and lead oxide in the pellets were reduced and molten therein and the remaining metal oxides formed slag Sℓ. The reduced iron was discharged as a molten pig iron Fe contained about 4 of carbon from the furnace 3 and charged as it was into an electric arc furnace. The formed slag was discharged together with molten iron while feeding power to the furnace and stirring molten burden, or the molten iron and slag were taken out separately from the different outlets after stopping power feed. The reduced lead Pb was separated in the induction furnace by means of the difference of the specific gravity from molten iron, and stored in a trap pot 4 from which lead was periodically taken out as crude one. The reduced zinc was vaporized due to its relatively lower boiling point, led to a condenser 5 together with the reducing gas CO in a gaseous state, condensed into a liquid zinc, and settled in a cooling launder 6 with the co vaporized reduced lead. After that, the reducing gas was sent to a gas holder 12 through a dust collector 10, a chlorine scrubber 11 and a desulfurization unit 12 after exchanging its heat at a heat exchanger 13 with the combustion air. From the gas holder, a part of the reducing gas was sent to a combustion furnace 8 as a fuel for obtaining a hot gas for drying and preheating pellets. The air preheated at the heat exchanger 13 was also sent to the furnace 8 for combustion of the reducing gas CO. Furthermore, the exhaust gas from the furnace 2 was led to a coke dryer 9 and utilized for drying coke. Thereafter, the gas was discharged through the dust collector 10 outside the plant. The pellets pelletized from the dust D were charged into the shaft type furnace 2 which has two zones one is a preheating including drying zone installed in the upper part of the furnace and the other is a prereducing zone in the lower part of the furnace. In the preheating zone, the pellets were heated in a short time by burning CO in the gas ascending the prereducing zone, and burning internal carbon in the pellets with the air A₂, and, if necessary, the air was enriched with oxygen. In this preheating zone, water and the loss on ignition contained were also removed. The preheated pellets were then going down to the prereducing zone of the furnace 2, and subject to reaction with the reducing gas provided from a furnace 8 for regulating the conditions of gas to prereduce iron oxide selectively. The conditions were regulated within the range surrounded by the equilibrium curves of FeO Co Fe CO₂ and C CO₂ 2CO for the selective reduction of iron oxide. It was preferred to set up the conditions in a range shown by hatching in FIGURE 3 which is formed when the equilibrium curve of ZnO Co Zn Co₂ is added to said two curves by setting the pressure of vaporized zinc at 0.02 atmospheric pressure, for example, to control the reduction of zinc oxide practically at zero level. Then, prereduced pellets were charged into the induction furnace 3 together with coke C dried in the coke dryer 9. Thereafter, the repetition of the procedures of Example 1 gave zinc, iron and lead, respectively. The reducing gas CO passed through the condenser 5 was led to the furnace 8. In this furnace, the reducing gas was partially burnt with the air, if required, oxygen gas enriched air so as to meet the aforementioned conditions of gas for selective prereduction of iron oxide. The exhaust gas G was discharged outside the plant through the dust collector 10, the scrubber 11 and the desulfurization unit 12 after having been utilized for drying coke C in the dryer 9.
