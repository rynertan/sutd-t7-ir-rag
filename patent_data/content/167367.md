# Wall mounted exercise unit.

## Abstract
A wall mounted exercise unit, particularly adapted for home or personal use. The exercise unit is readily stored in a folded position and includes an exercise bench 400 which may be pivoted at an intermediate location to provide a wide range of exercise positions. Various accessory units may be readily incorporated into the exercise unit. The exercise unit may include a carriage assembly 200 which allows the user to selectively exert a lifting force equal to either the full amount of weight set on the exercise unit, or only a portion of the weight set.
