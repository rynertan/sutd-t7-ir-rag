# Apparatus and method for measuring optically active materials.

## Abstract
A polarimeter system and method for sensing optical rotation caused by otically active materials in a solution are disclosed. The polarimeter system 10 includes a light source 11 for emitting infrared light, a polarizer 14 operatively connected to intercept the infrared light to produce a polarized beam therefrom and means for directing the beam through a sample of optically active material 15 , which rotates the light beam. A beam splitting prism 16 splits the rotated polarized beam into its horizontal and vertical components. Infra red light detectors 17a and 17b convert the horizontal and vertical light components into electrical signals representative of the optical rotation caused by the sample solution. Shaping circuitry 26 conditions the electrical signals for use by analog or digital 28 networks, that present the optical rotation or its physical correlative factor. Feedback circuitry 36 may be used to vary the light source 11 intensity in response to the detected light signals.
