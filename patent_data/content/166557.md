# Process for Waste Treatment.

## Abstract
Aqueous alkaline sulfidic waste effluents are often sub jected to air oxidation processes that for economic sizing oxi dise the sulfides only to thiosulfates. Thiosulfates are still im mediate oxygen demanders and thus their concentration in the effluent must normally be reduced to below a threshold level before the effluent can be discharged. The effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide for this purpose can be significantly im proved both as to rate of reaction and extent of removal by em ploying a coppper catalyst in solution.
