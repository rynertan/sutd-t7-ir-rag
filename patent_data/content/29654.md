# Non woven fabric made from polybutadiene and method of making it.

## Abstract
A non woven fabric comprising an assembly of fibers of discrete length which are interconnected and, at least a portion of which are in contact with each other, said fibrers comprising crystalline syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene 1,2 SBD .
