# Electro erosion print head assembly and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
An electro erosion head assembly is formed from a stack of thin laminae 6 of electrically conductive material. Each lamina has narrow extensions from an edge thereof to form electrodes 2. A connector tab 4 extends from the other edge thereof. Each lamina 6 is coated with a thin coating of insulation material except on the connector tab 4 which is tin lead coated for eventual soldering. The insulated laminae are stacked to form a head assembly and are encapsulated in plastics potting compound 16 which is ground down to expose the end faces of the electrodes. The electrodes 2 are located at the same locations on each lamina 6 so that, when stacked, they form heads comprising columns of electrodes, each capable of forming a spot in the electro erosion process. The connector tabs 4 are spaced from one another at the other edge of the sheets so as to make each connector tab available for a solder connection and thus give the required connection fanout.
