# Temperature compensated orientation of berlinite for surface acoustic wave devices.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric wafer of single crystal berlinite, having a surface defined by an X axis boule cut at an angle in the range from about 94 104 , provides an improved substrate for a surface acoustic wave device. These cut angles are relatively easy to fabricate, provide excellent temperature compensation in a range from 55 to 125 C, and have high piezoelectric coupling coefficient.
