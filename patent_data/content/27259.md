# Silver halide photographic emulsions including dye sensitizers and supersensitizing or stabilizing amounts of a polymeric compound, and photographic elements, particularly radiographic elements, including said emulsions.

## Abstract
Object of the invention are photographic emulsions including silver halide grains dispersed in gelatin and at least a methine dye spectral sensitizer associated with said grains, including in association therewith a supersensitizing or stabil izing amount of a polymeric compound having an aminoallyl idenmalononitrile moiety. The invention further relates to photographic elements, in particular radiographic elements, comprising said emulsions. According to the invention, said polymeric compound is obtained upon copolymerization of an allyl monomer, comprising said aminoallylidenmalono nitrile moiety, with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer.
