# 7 AMINO 3 SUBSTITUTED METHYL 3 CEPHEM 4 CARBOXYLIC ACID AND LOWER ALKYLSILYL DERIVATIVES THEREOF, AND THEIR PRODUCTION

## Abstract
Various 7 amino 3 substituted methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acids and lower alkylsilyl derivatives such as 7 amino 3 2,3 cyclopenteno 1 pyridiniomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid iodide and trimethylsilyl 7 trimethyl silylamino 3 5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 2 isoquinoliniomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylate iodide are valuable intermediates in the preparation of cephalosporin antibacterial agents. A new process for the preparation of these acids and derivatives has been devised.
