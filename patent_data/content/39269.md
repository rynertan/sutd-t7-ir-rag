# Pacemaker atrial refractory control for R wave rejection.

## Abstract
An artificial heart pacemaker having an atrial synchron ous pacing mode includes an output pulse generator 20 for delivering stimulating pulses to the ventricle of the heart, and atrial 40 and ventricular 30 sensing amplifiers for detecting, respectively, atrial and ventricular contractions. The atrial sense amplifier 40 starts an A V delay timer 50 which pro vides a delayed triggering pulse to the pulse generator 20 to maintain A V synchrony. Circuitry 44, 46 is provided for blanking or turning off the atrial sensing amplifier 40 during the time that the ventricular sensing amplifier 30 is refrac tory, and preferably for a short time interval thereafter, to prevent delivery of an output pulse in response to a premature ventricular contraction erroneously sensed as an atrial con traction.
