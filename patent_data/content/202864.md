# REMOTE CONTROL OF ELECTRICAL HEATING APPLIANCES

## Abstract
An electrical heating appliance, e.g. a radiant fire, has manual switches which can be by passed to allow for remote control. A hand held controller 27 produces a beam of infra red energy which impinges on a sensor 26 . Control box 24 receives command signals from sensor 26 and carries out an appropriate switching operation. The control ler 27 has slider switches 29, 30, 31 for selecting the desired heating appliance mode of operation, but these are ineffective until pressure switch 28 is pressed to produce the beam. An alternative arrangement has the sensor distant from the heating appliance.
