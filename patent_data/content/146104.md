# POLYESTER THERMOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITIONS WITH GOOD MOLD RELEASE

## Abstract
The present disclosure is concerned with reinforced flame retarded polyethylene terephthalate molding composi tions which have good mold release properties upon being in jection molded because they contain low molecular weight copolymer acids which may have been neutralized with se lected metal cations. If these copolymer acids are used in suffi cient amount they may also act as drip suppressant agents thus allowing the compositions to reproducibly obtain a UL 94 rating at 1 32 of V O. When used in lower amounts in combina tion with other drip suppressants these low molecular weight copolymer acids provide both enhanced mold release and en hanced drip suppression. These compositions contain a flame retardant package sufficient to give the base polyethylene ter ephthalate resin a UL 94 rating at 1 8 of V O when tested with just the flame retardant package. These compositions are pref erably reinforced with glass or other fibers. The addition to these compositions of a compound bearing at least 3 terminal epoxy groups can improve the composition s physical proper ties and does improve their resistance to degradation due to thermal or hydrolysis exposure. These compositions are suit able for the injection molding of a wide variety of articles of commerce.
