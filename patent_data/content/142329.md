# Control system for combinatorial weighing or counting apparatus.

## Abstract
A control system for a combinatorial weighing or counting apparatus includes a main central processing unit for effecting the combinatorial arithmetic operation, and a plurality of individual drive unit central processing units associated respectively with driver units of the weighing machines and connected to the main central processing unit for controlling the drive units, respectively. Operation com mands delivered from the main central processing unit to the individual drive unit central processing units are set by interrupt processes of the individual drive unit central processing units at all times.
