## Description
As shown by Williams, U.S A 4,273,712, and 4,257,953, methods are provided for making aromatic bis etherimide s of the formula, where R is a monovalent radical selected from hydrogen, a C and an alkali metal phenoxide of the formula, The phase transfer catalyst utilized by Williams were tetraorgano ammonium or phosphonium salts which allowed for the production of aromatic etherimides in the absence of a dipolar aprotic solvent. Although valuable results are obtained in accordance with the practice of the Williams methods, quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts are often unstable. As a result, these phase transfer catalysts are often difficult to recycle. In EP A 0 126 950, certain diorganoaminopyridinium salts, such as neopentyldialkylaminopyridinium salts, were found to be highly effective phase transfer catalysts. In addition, these diorganoaminopyridinium salts unlike the quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts of US A 4,273,712 and 4,257,953 are very stable and can be recycled satisfactorily. As utilized hereinafter, the term catalyst stability means the half life of the catalyst as determined by heating an equal molar amount of phase transfer catalyst and the disodium salt of bisphenol A in toluene under sealed conditions for a particular period of time which can vary between one half hour or less to 16 hours or more. Assuming a pseudo first order for decomposition of the phase transfer catalyst, the amount of catalyst remaining after a certain heating period as determined by NMR analysis can be extrapolated or interpolated to determine the midpoint of the linear plot. This procedure is shown by J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry , 2nd Ed., pp. 199 202. This procedure will provide a plot of ln catalyst vs. time, should yield a linear plot. Experience has shown that the half life or stability of the diorganoaminopyridinium salts, as shown in EP A 0 126 950, is about 2 hours, while the half life of the quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts can be as little as around 8 minutes. However, as shown in EP A 0 126 950, maximum stability of the N alkyldiorganoaminopyridinium salts is achieved by introducing neopentyl functionality onto the diorganoaminopyridinium nucleus. The resulting neopentyldialkylpyridinium salts have been found to have half lives as high as twelve hours as compared to 8 minutes for the quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts and 2 hours for the N linear C The present invention is based on the discovery that 2 ethylhexyl salts of dialkylaminopyridine have half lives as high as eleven hours. Surprisingly, these branched alkyl salts of dialkylaminopyridine, unlike the aforementioned neopentyl dialkylaminopyridinium salts requiring several days to synthesize, can be made at yields exceeding 90 , by stirring a mixture of a dialkylaminopyridine with a 2 ethylhexylalkanesulfonate at 110 There is provided by the present invention N 2 branched alkyldiorganoaminopyridinium salts of the formula where R² and R³ are monovalent organo radicals selected from C Radicals included by R, are for example, phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, chlorophenyl, bromonaphthyl, and alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl. Radicals included by R¹ are the aforementioned aromatic radicals, such as phenylene, tolylene, naphthylene, and R¹ more particularly includes and divalent organic radicals of the general formula, where X is a member selected from the class consisting of divalent radicals of the formula, O and S , where m is 0 or 1, y is a whole number from 1 to 5. M is more particularly sodium, potassium, lithium, rubidium counter ions included by formula 4 are, for example, fluoride, bromide, chloride, methanesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, nitrite, sulfate, acetate. Included by the substituted phthalimides of formula 2 are for example, These substituted phthalimides can be made by standard procedures, such as effecting reaction between substantially equal moles of the corresponding phthalic anhydride and an organic amine in the presence of refluxing acetic acid. Included by the organic amines which can be used, are, for example, aniline, toluidene, methylamine, ethylamine. Some of the alkylaminopyridines of formula 4 which can be used as phase transfer catalysts are, for example, The N 2 branched alkyldiorganoaminopyridinium salts of formula 4 can be made by alkylating diorganoaminopyridines which can be made by reacting 4 hydroxypyridine with phosphorous pentoxide and a diorganoamine at 200 where R² and R³ are as previously defined. The alkylation of the above diorganoaminopyridines can be achieved in a straight forward manner utilizing such reagents as isobutylbromide, 2 ethylhexylbromide, at ambient temperatures in an inert organic solvent, for example, chloroform or toluene. Reaction with such branched alkyl compounds, as well as the corresponding tosylate or mesylate can be facilitated by using higher temperatures such as refluxing toluene, or temperatures up to about 150 The alkali metal salts of formula 3 can be made by various procedures, including the flash evaporation of bisphenoxide alkali metal salt hydrate or an aqueous slurry thereof, as shown by U.S A 4,202,993, or by azeotroping water from an aqueous mixture of bisphenoxide alkali metal salt and toluene as shown by U.S A 4,257,953. Additional procedures are shown in U.S A 3,852,242. Some of the alkali metal salts of the above described alkali phenoxides of formula 3 are sodium and potassium salt phenols, such as phenol, cresol, naphthol dihydric phenols, for example, In the following examples all parts are by weight. A mixture of 12.217 grams of dimethylaminopyridine, 20.833 grams of 2 ethylhexylmethane sulfonate was stirred and heated at 110 Following the procedure of Example 1, a mixture of 35.25 grams of 4 methylpiperidinylpyridine, and 43.73 grams of 2 ethylhexylmethane sulfonate resulted in the production of 60.83 grams of N 2 ethylhexyl 4 methylpiperidinylaminopyridine chloride having a melting point of 263 264 A mixture of 2.0 mmoles of 4 nitro N methylphthalimide, .013 grams of N 2 ethylhexyl 4 methylpiperidinylaminopyridine chloride and 102 milligrams of fluorenone internal standard was dried in an air oven at 140 A study was conducted to determine the stability of various phase transfer catalysts by contacting the catalyst with a mixture of the disodium salt of bisphenol A and toluene. A vial containing 1.00 mmole of phase transfer catalyst and 1.00 mmole of the disodium salt of bisphenol A was placed in a vial with toluene. The vial was sealed under substantially anhydrous conditions and heated for a certain time at a particular temperature. At the end of the reaction the vial was allowed to cool and its contents were quenched with water and extracted into methylene chloride. NMR analysis using tetrachlorobenzene as an internal standard provided a measure of the amount of catalyst remaining. Assuming a first order reaction of the catalyst, the half life of the phase transfer catalyst was determined from the decomposition data. The following results were obtained, where t 1 2 is the half life of the catalyst, TBABr is tetrabutylammonium bromide, N neopentyl 4 N ,N dihexylaminopyridinium bromide is NPDHAPB, N 2 ethylhexyl 4 methylpiperidinylpyridinium chloride is EHMPPC, butyldimethylaminopyridinium chloride is BDMPC, and N 2 ethylhexyldimethylaminopyridinium chloride is EHDMPC. The above results show that the branched alkyldiorganoaminopyridinium salts of the present invention possess superior stability as phase transfer catalysts for bisimide formation compared to the tetrabutylammonium bromide salts of the prior art. In addition, the half lives of 8 hours and 11 hours are substantially equivalent to the neopentyldibutylaminopyridinium bromide of the copending application of Brunelle et al, while being significantly better than the butyldimethylaminopyridinium chloride of Brunelle et al, exhibiting a half life of only 2 hours.
