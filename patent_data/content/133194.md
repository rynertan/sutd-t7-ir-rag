# Oral implant for oversized dental support openings.

## Abstract
An oral implant allows for the immediate installation of an artificial tooth support structure in a jawbone portion which has become oversized due to a failed prior blade implant or an enlarged tooth socket. The implant includes one or more posts upon which the artificial tooth is mounted, as well as a support structure whose lateral dimension is sufficient to permit it to be wedged in the oversized opening. Preferably, the lateral dimension is adjustable to various size openings in the jawbone.
