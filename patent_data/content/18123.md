# PREMIX BURNER SYSTEM FOR BOTH LOW AND HIGH BTU GAS FUEL

## Abstract
A premix type gaseous fuel burning system 10 for alternate or simultaneous combustion of low BTU gas 29 and normal BTU gas 27 comprises a gas supply means 35 for providing both high BTU gas 27 and low BTU gas 29 at a selected substantial velocity and a burner tube 44 for receiving the gas, whereby primary air 41 is inducted into the burner tube 44 and mixed with the gas flow. A burner head 64 comprises a long narrow rec tangular structure of tapered construction that is inserted upwardly into a corresponding rectangular opening 28 in the floor 24 of the furnace 18 . The opening 28 is also tapered in the same direction as the burner head 64 but with a selected annular spacing 70 between the walls of the opening 28 and the burner head 64 . Means 76, 78 are provided for vertically adjusting the position of the burner head 64 within the opening 28 . Secondary com bustion air 62 is directed through the annular space 70 between the burner head 64 and the opening 28 in the floor 24 of a furnace 18 .
