## Description
SALT SUBSTITUTE BLENDS OF POTASSIUM CHLORIDE AND MALTODEXTRIN AND METHOD OF PREPARATION. The present invention relates to a blend composition useful as a substitute for salt. There are a number of salt substitute compositions which are described in the literature and or are available commercially containing potassium chloride with and without sodium chloride. Such compositions have been proposed for people who seek to eliminate or minimize the amount of sodium chloride in thei r diet due to medical necessity or for other reasons. However, the heretofore known salt substitutes have not been entirely satisfactory from the standpoints of similarity to common salt i.e. sodium chloride in taste and appearance. Accordingly, there is a substantial need in the art for an improved salt substitute composition. In our copending European Application No. filed concurrently herewith our ref CTE JFA 84127 , there is described a salt substitute composition which comprises coated particles, each particle comprising a a core comprising potassium chloride and b a coating on the core, the coating comprising maltodextrin, wherein the dextrose equivalent D.E. of the combined core and coating is not more than 10 D.E. units. It has now been found unexpectedly that an effective salt substitute can be prepared in simple and efficient manner by admixing potassium chloride and maltodextrin. If desired, sodium chloride or cream of tartar, or a mixture thereof, may additionally be included in such salt substitutes. Admixtures resulting from such admixing have unexpectedly been found to be effective salt substitute compositions which at least closely approach the taste and appearance of salt and substantially fulfill the above mentioned need. Generally stated, the present invention provides a salt substitute blend composition which comprises a uniform admixture comprising a potassium chloride and b maltodextrin, wherein the detrose equivalent D.E. of the admixture is not more than 10 D.E. units. According to a preferred aspect of the invention there is provided a salt substitute blend composition which comprises a uniform admixture consisting essentially of a potassium chloride and b maltodextrin, wherein the dextrose equivalent D.E. of the combined amount of potassium chloride and maltodextrin is not more than 10 D.E. units. The invention further provides a salt substitute blend composition which comprises a uniform admixture comprising a potassium chloride b maltodextrin and c sodium chloride, wherein the dextrose equivalent D.E. of the combined amount of potassium chloride, maltodextrin and sodium chloride is not more than 10 D.E. units. In a preferred embodiment, the above salt substitute composition further includes, in addition to the specified components a , b and c , cream of tartar. In this embodiment, the D.E. of the combined amount of potassium chloride, maltodextrin, sodium chloride and cream of tartar is preferably not more than 10 D.E. units. In another of its aspects the invention provides a salt substitute blend composition which comprises a uniform admixture comprising a potassium chloride, b maltodextrin and c cream of tartar, and being free of sodium chloride, wherein the dextrose equivalent D.E. of the combined amount of potassium chloride, maltodextrin and cream of tartar is not more than 10 D.E. units. As used herein with reference to a material, the terms dextrose equivalent and D.E. mean the total amount of reducing sugars calculated as dextrose in the material, which amount is expressed as a percent of the total weight dry basis of the material. Such percent is referred to herein as D.E. units. Reducing sugars include, e.g., all monosaccharides maltose cellobiose and lactose. Sucrose is a non reducing sugar. The D.E. of a material consisting of two or more components can be calculated by multiplying the weight fraction w.f. of each component of the material by the D.E. of such component and adding the resulting products of multiplication.For example, a material consisting of 20 0.20 w.f. component A having a D.E. of 10 D.E. units and 80 0.80 w.f. component B having a D.E. of zero has a D.E. of 2 0.20 x 10 0.80x0 D.E. units. The salt substitute of the present invention contains at least two essential components, namely potassium chloride and maltodextrin, as indicated above.In addition the salt substitute of the invention may include sodium chloride and or cream of tartar. In general, these components may be combined in any relative proportions in accordance with the teachings hereof to prepare a broad range of salt substitutes useful for a wide variety of end use applications, e.g., for table salt, inclusion in snack foods e.g., pretzels, potato chips potato crisps , corn chips corn crisps , etc. , cereals, baked goods and other edible compositions such as those which heretofore have included common salt i.e., sodium chloride as an ingredient thereof. In use, the salt substitutes of the present invention may be substituted in whole or in part for the common salt component of heretofore known edible compositions. When the salt substitute includes only the two components potassium chloride and maltodextrin, these may be present in the below indicated amounts potassium chloride from about 99 to about 60 , and maltodextrin from about 1 to about 40 , wherein the percentage amounts are by weight based on the combined weight of such components. As a general preference, the potassium chloride component in such a two component mixture is included in an amount from about 90 to about 70 and the maltodextrin component is included in an amount from about 10 to about 30 , wherein the percentage amounts are by weight based on the combined weight of such components.

As shown by the taste panel results in Table V, the salt substitute admixture of the present invention illustrated by Example 9 has been found to closely approach the taste of common salt sodium chloride and more closely approach such taste than each of the other comparative materials set forth therein in at least one taste characteristic. Comparison of the taste characteristics ratings set forth in Table V for the admixture of Example 9 with the taste characteristics ratings set forth in Table III for the admixture of Example 6 shows that the admixture of Example 9 including CT was found to still more closely approach common salt in taste than the admixture of Example 6 not including CT . EXAMPLES 10 12 Additional admixture compositions of this invention containing potassium chloride, maltodextrin MD , sodium chloride and cream of tartar CT were prepared in these examples. The preparation procedure of Example 9 was repeated in each of these examples except that the amounts of potassium chloride, sodium chloride and cream of tartar added in forming the admixtures were as follows Example 10 KC1 71.76 parts , NaCl 8 parts and CT 0.24 part Example 11 KC1 71.64 parts , NaCI 8 parts and CT 0.36 part and Example 12 KC1 75.62 parts , NaCl 4 parts andCT 0.38 part .

The admixture of Example 10 was found to more closely approach common salt from the standpoint of saltiness than the admixture ofExample 12. The admixture of Example 11 was found to more closely approach common salt from such standpoint than the admixture of Example 10. It is recognized that different end users may desire different levels of sodium chloride, and accordingly the bes t salt substitute composition containing, in addition to potassium chloride and maltodextrin, also sodium chloride and possibly also cream of tartar will depend on the desires of a given end user.
