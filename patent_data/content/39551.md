# A stabilised antenna arrangement.

## Abstract
A stabilised ship borne antenna arrangement is provided with an antenna 20 which is stabilised against pitching and rolling motions of the ship on which it is mounted. The antenna is intended to rotate in azimuth about a stabilised vertical axis 12 and it is mounted on a rotatable member which rotates about an unsta bilised axis 11 , which is fixed relative to the ship. Linear actuators 5, 21 link the antenna to the rotatable member with the lengths of the actuators 5 being ad justed so as to maintain the vertical axis 12 of the antenna as it rotates. The stabilised portion of the an tenna arrangement is relatively light with a low centre of gravity.
