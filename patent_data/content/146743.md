## Description
This invention relates to gene fragments derived from human immunoglobulin genes. More specifically, this invention relates to an enhancer DNA segment derived from a human immunoglobulin gene, a structural gene fragment, a promoter segment and to a human gene fragment based on a combination of these. In recent years, studies have been made on immunoglobulin genes, and the elucidation of the heavy H chain in a human immunoglobulin has been under way. It is well known that the H chain is composed mainly of a site of bonding to an antigen which is a variable region called V and a constant region called C which has physiological activities such as bonding to a complement or interaction with a specific cell see Gendai Kagaku Modern Chemistry , November 1981, pages 62 68, published by Baifukan, Tokyo . Elucidation of the DNA sequence and function of immunoglobulin genes has been done to a considerable extent with regard to mouse genes. It has been found that in the variable region V of a mouse immunoglobulin, a V gene, a D gene and a J gene exist in this sequence and a DNA segment having the function of a promoter exists upstream on the 5 side of the V gene. Furthermore, it has been presumed that between the J gene and the constant region C , a DNA segment having the function of markedly enhancing the transcription efficiency, i.e. an enhancer, exists. See Gendai Kagaku , November 1983, pages 62 68, published by Baifukan, Tokyo. It is said that this enhancer exists downstream of the J gene when it is of the undifferentiated type, it cannot enhance the transcription efficiency because the promoter is remote but it becomes phenotypic upon recombination in V J and V D J joinings and gains the function of enhancing the efficiency of transcription from the promoter existing upstream of the V gene. Recently, Walter Schaffner et al. reported the DNA sequence of an enhancer in mouse H chain genes Cell, Vol. 33, 729 740, July 1983 . Susumu Tonegawa et al. likewise discovered the existence of an enhancer in mouse H chain genes and its base sequence see Cell, Vol. 33, 717 728, July 1983 . David Baltimore et al. also reported the existence of an enhancer in the mouse L chain and its DNA sequence see Cell, Vol. 33, 741 748, July 1983 . Cell, volume 27, pages 583 to 591, 1981 , describes the structure of the human immunoglobulin µ locus. Characterized is a 30 Kb segment of the human genome that plays a critical role in the formation of this variable region as well as in the expression of the two heavy chains that appear earliest in immunocyte ontogeny, the µ and the δ chains. Thus, with regard to the mouse H chain and L chain genes, the existence of not only various gene units contained in the variable region V and the constant region C but also units having various functions such as promoters and enhancers has been elucidated, and the DNA sequences of some of them have been determined. Before December 6, 1983 which is the filing date of Japanese Patent Application No. 229037 1983 from which the Convention priority of the present application is claimed, the constituent genes and their functions in the H chains of human immunoglobulin genes were gradually elucidated, but the existence of enhancers was only conjectured. The whole DNA sequence of such an enhancer and DNA sequence units that permit performance of its function were not known. Very recently, T. H. Rabbitts et al. and Susumu Tonegawa et al., independently from each other, reported the DNA sequences of enhancers in the H chains of human immunoglobulin genes see Nature, Vol. 306, 806 809, 22 29, December 1983 and ibid., Vol. 307, 334 340, 26 January 1984 . On the other hand, the DNA sequences of the D gene and a promoter contained in the variable region of the H chain of human immunoglobulin genes have not been known at all. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide an enhancer DNA segment derived from a human immunoglobulin gene. Another object of this invention is to provide a gene fragment which contains enhancer DNA segments derived from a structural gene and a human immunoglobulin gene optionally together with a promoter segment derived from a human immunoglobulin gene, and contributes to enhancement of the efficiency of transcription and translation. According to the present invention there is provided an enhancer DNA containing segment isolated as a 1.4Kbp The units which can constitute the enhancer DNA segment derived from a human immunoglobulin gene in accordance with this invention are included in the aforesaid sequence. In the direction of sequence, the left side shows a base at the 5 terminal and the right side, a base at the 3 terminal. The units E₁, E₂ and E₃ form base pairs with complementary bases. Accordingly, the enhancer DNA segment of this invention comprises a strand containing the units E₁, E₂ and E₃ and a strand comlementary strand containing complementary base units forming base pairs with the units E₁ to E₃. The enhancer DNA segment of this invention contains the units E₁, E₂ and E₃, and preferably not more than 50 base pairs in total. Preferably, the enhancer DNA segment of this invention comprises a strand containing at least one of the following DNA units E₅ and E₆ In the above preferred embodiment, the units E₅ and E₄ exist before the unit E₁ on the 5 side and the units E₆ and E₇ exist after the unit E₃ on the 3 side , and the total number of base pairs can be 150 or less. An enhancer DNA segment containing the above units E₁, E₂, E₃, E₅ and E₆ is more preferred, and an enhancer DNA segment containing these units and further at least one of the units E₄ and E₇ before the unit E₅ in the case of the unit E₄ and after the unit E₆ in the case of the unit E₇ is particularly advantageous. In this case, the total number of base pairs can be 300 or less. An example of the enhancer DNA segment of this invention which contains all of the units E₄, E₅, E₁, E₂, E₃, E₆ and E₇ in this sequence is one comprising a strand represented by the following DNA sequence E In the exemplified DNA segment, the following unit E The enhancer DNA segment of this invention contributes to the expression of protein forming function derived from a structural gene and to the enhancement of the efficiency of expression of the aforesaid function. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a gene fragment comprising a the enhancer DNA segment of the invention and b a structural gene. Examples of the structural gene constituting the above gene fragment are human structural genes, structural genes of mammals other than humans, particularly human immunoglobulin genes and immunoglobulin genes of mammals other than humans, an insulin gene, and an interferon gene. The structural genes may, for example, be human immunoglobulin genes such as a human V gene, a human D gene, a human J gene and a human C The functions and DNA sequences of these human immunoglobulin protein genes, except the DNA sequences of the D and V genes, are known as follows A gene which codes a variable region of about 100 residual groups from the NH₂ end of immunoglobulin molecules. A gene which codes a joining portion between the variable region and the constant region of immunoglobulin molecules see, for example, J. G. Seidman, E.E. Max and P. Leder, Nature, A gene which exists between the J gene and the V gene and codes that portion of immunoglobulin molecules in which greatest diversity is observed see, for example, J. Schilling, B. Clevinger, J. M. Davie and L. Hood, Nature, One of genes which code a constant region portion of about 330 residual groups from the COOH terminal of immunoglobulin H chain molecules. C With regard to the other structural genes, the following function and DNA sequence of the beta globin gene are known. A gene that codes globin which is a protein portion of hemoglobin. The DNA sequences of the D gene and V gene have been elucidated for the first time by the inventors of the present invention. The human D gene comprises a strand represented by the following DNA sequence D The human V gene is composed of a strand represented by the following DNA sequence V wherein A, C, G and T are as defined hereinabove, and a complementary strand thereof. The human J gene comprises a strand represented by the following DNA sequence J wherein A, C, G and T are as defined, and a complementary strand thereof. The gene fragment of this invention comprising the enhancer DNA segment a and the structural gene b contains at least one of the above genes as the structural gene. When the structural genes are the human V gene, human D gene and human J gene, they are preferably joined in this sequence. Furthermore, in the gene fragment of this invention, the enhancer DNA segment a is positioned up to about 5 kilobase pairs Kbp from the structural gene b . Likewise, the structural gene b is positioned on the side of the 5 terminal base of the enhancer DNA segment a . In the gene fragment of this invention, the human D gene, the human V gene and the human J gene respectively transcribe m RNA ribonucleic acid . The human D gene transcribes a human D m RNA comprising a strand represented by the following RNA base sequence RD The human V gene transcribes a human V m RNA comprising a strand represented by the following RNA base sequence RV wherein a, c, g and u are as defined hereinabove. The human J gene transcribes a human J m RNA comprising a strand represented by the following RNA base sequence RJ wherein a, c, g and u are defined as above. When in the gene fragment of this invention, the structural gene is the human D gene, human V gene or human J gene, each of these genes may be defined by a polypeptide chain which it encodes instead of defining it by the afore said DNA sequence. Specifically, the human D gene can be defined as a gene which encodes a polypeptide chain represented by the following amino acid sequence AD The human V gene may be defined as a gene which encodes a polypeptide chain represented by the following amino acid sequence AV wherein Gly, Leu, Arg, Trp, Asn, Asp and Val are as defined above, and Ala, Lys, His, Ile, Phe, Ser, Tyr, Thr, Cys, Pro, Met, Glu and Gln repsectively represent alanine, lysine, histidine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, serine, tyrosine, threonine, cystine, proline, methionine, glutamic acid and glutamine. The human J gene may be defined as a gene which encodes a polypeptide chain represented by the following amino acid sequence AJ Investigations of the present inventors have now shown the existence of a DNA segment having the function of a promoter in the H chain of human immunoglobulin genes, which has previously been only conjectured. Heretofore, mouse immunoglobulin genes have been considerably studied, and it is said that when an undifferentiated immunoglobulin gene is reconstructed into a phenotypic immunoglobulin gene by recombination in V J and V D J joinings, the promoter existing upstream of the V gene has the function of enhancing the efficiency of transcription. The present inventors have discovered that a promoter segment exists in an intron between the leading region and the variable region in the H chains of human immunoglobulin genes, and have determined the DNA sequence of the promoter. It is believed that the promoter segment of this invention, either by itself or in combination with the enhancer DNA segment, has the action of markedly enhancing the efficiency of transcription of not only the V gene, D gene and J gene but also structural genes to be replicated, transcribed or translated. Accordingly, the promoter segment of this invention is expected to be very useful for the production of large quantities of proteins, for example human monoclonal antibodies. Accordingly, the present invention provides a gene fragment isolated as a 3.4Kb EcoRI Hind III fragment derived from a 21Kb EcoRI region of the human genome comprising wherein A, C, G and T are as defined hereinabove, wherein A, C, G and T are as defined hereinabove, wherein A, C, G and T are as defined hereinabove, the structural gene b being positioned between the enhancer DNA segment a and the promoter segment c . In the above gene fragment, the enhancer DNA segment a is positioned preferably up to about 5 Kbp away from the structural gene b , and the promoter segment c is positioned preferably up to about 5 Kbp away from the structural gene b . In the above gene fragment, the above promoter segment may contain one or more of the above DNA sequence units P₁, P₂ and P₃. Preferably, the promoter segment contains the DNA sequence units P₁, P₂ and P₃, and more preferably in such a relation that P₁ is positioned on the side of the 5 terminal base of P₂, and P₂ is positioned on the side of the 5 terminal base of P₃. With regard to the sequence of a , b and c , it is preferred that the promoter segment c is positioned on the side of the 5 terminal base of the structural gene b , and the structural gene b is positioned on the side of the 5 terminal base of the enhancer DNA segment a . The relative positions of the enhancer DNA segment, the immunoglobulin gene and the promoter segment in a human chromosomal DNA will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

A specific procedure of forming a human immunoglobulin H chain by the gene fragments in accordance with this invention will be described. The human immunoglobulin gene fragment containing the units 1 to 4 described above is inserted into a vector to form a hybrid DNA. Examples of such a vector are phage vectors for For example, Charon 4A phage vector is cleaved with restriction endonuclease The hybrid DNA is digested with a suitable restriction endonuclease to obtain a large amount of the desired human gene fragment. To obtain the human gene fragment in large amounts, it is inserted, for example, into an To prepare each of the hybrid DNAs 1 to 6 in large quantities, Likewise, to obtain the aforesaid human DNA fragment having a length of about 21 Kb in large quantities, the following plasmid or transformant, for example, is prepared.
