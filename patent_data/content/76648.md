# Electrodeless fluorescent light source.

## Abstract
An electrodeless fluorescent light source 10 including an electrodeless lamp 11 containing a metal iodide or iodine 12 . A fluorescing material 20 is disposed between the electrodeless lamp 11 and an outer envelope 17 . When the contents 12 of the electrodeless lamp 11 are excited by high frequency power, excited iodine atoms emit ultraviolet radiation. The ultraviolet radiation impinges on the fluoresc ing material 20 causing it to emit visible light. The fluorescing material 20 may be a solid phosphor material on the outer surface of the electrodeless lamp, a solid phosphor material on the inner surface of the outer en velope, a gaseous phosphor material 20 in the space between the electrodeless lamp 11 and the outer envelope 17 , or some combination thereof.
