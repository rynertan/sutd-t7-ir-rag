## Description
Dual Circuit Fluid Pressure Control ValveThis invention relates to dual circuit fluid pressure control valves and relates especially, but not exclusively to dual circuit compressed air control valves for vehicle braking circuits.In compressed air vehicle braking systems there is a requirement for a fluid pressure control valve which is operable by a driver s foot pedal to produce two independently sourced output pressures. In order to economise upon the capacity of reservoirs supplying fluid pressure to such a valve it is convenient to design the valve such that it will operate from a pressure source say 11 bar which is substantially higher than the maximum operable output pressure say 7 bar , which is required to be produced by the control valve. In the case of such a valve design with two valves in tandem there may be a problem owing to mechanical interaction between the two mechanisms of the two valves such that one valve may produce a lower than desired output pressure if the pressure source of the other valve drops or if the output of the other valve falls to zero due to circuit failure.According to the present invention there is provided a dual circuit fluid pressure control valve including a housing and main moving means for moving first pressure responsive means movement of which in one direction is effective to operate a double valve in a sense to close a path between a first output port and atmosphere and open a path between a, first fluid pressure input port the reaultirlg output pressure at the output port acting on the pressure responsive means in the opposite sense and also acting on second pressure responsive means the send of movement of which in response to increase of said output pressure is effective to operate a further double valve in a sense to close a path between a second fluid pressure output port and atmosphere and to open a path between a second fluid pressure input port and said second output port resulting output pressure at the second output port acting on the second pressure responsive means in the opposite sense to cause a lapping of the second valve characterised by the main moving means having a movement range which limits the first output pressure and said first pressure responsive means having a discreet pressure responsive area pressure on which corresponding to the presence of fluid pressure at the second output port acts in a sense to attenuate the fluid pressure at the first output port.In order that the invention may be more clearly understood and readily carried into effect the same will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing which illustrates in sectional diagrammatical form one embodiment of such a dual circuit fluid pressure control valve.Referring to the drawing the dual circuit fluid pressure control valve illustrated therein is designed as a tamdem r oot valve for use in a dual circuit fluid pressure operable vehicle braking system. The valve comp 8 8 an assembly of two valves contained in a main housing denoted by reference 1, the housing having a first reservoir input port 2 a second reservoir input port 3, a first circuit output port 4 and a second circuit output port 5. The whole assembly has a central passage 6 vented through a vent cap 7. In the example shown the output port 5 is indicated as connected not only to a second circuit II but also connected to port 8 of the valve. The connection between ports 5 and 8 is shown externally in the drawing but may be incorporated in the body of the housing.The valve assembly is provided with main moving means comprising a plunger 9 engageable by a driver s foot pedal mechanism to act through springs 10 and 11 on pressure responsive means in the form of a piston 12 slideable in a cylindrical portion 13 of the housing.The downward movement of the plunger 9 is limIted by a stop 30 to limit the output pressure obtainable.The cylindrical portion 13 of piston 12 stepped to provide a discreet annular pressure responsive area 32 the outer diameter of which corresponds to the diameter of the cylinder wall 13. The piston also has a supplementary annular area the inner diameter of which is that of a cylindrical wall 13 and the outer diameter of which corresponds to the wall 14. The port 8 communicates with this annular area of the piston the pressure acting against the force of the springs 10 and 11. The piston 12 carries a sealingly slideable double valve member 15 of a first valve which is urged by a light spriIS11RP488 towards an inlet valve seat 17 carried within the piston skirt 18. Of slightly less diameter than the inlet valve seat 17 an exhaust valve seat 19 is provided for.the first valve, this exhaust. valve seat being carried by second pressure responsive means in the form of a central piston assembly 20 which also carries a corresponding exhaust valve seat 21 for a second valve.The second valve comprises a sealingly slideable valve member 22 in the main housing which is urged by a light spring 23 towards an inlet valve seat 24, the diameter of which is substantially the same as 17 and, therefore, somewhat larger than the diameter of the exhaust valve seat 21 carried by the piston 20.Piston 20 is provided with a venting passage 25 between a pair of 0 rings to avoid the possibility of interaction of pressures arising above and below the piston.Similarly, the piston 12 is provided with a venting passage 26 between a pair of 0 rings to prevent 0 ring leakage providing communication between the output ports 4 and 5 to the respective circuits I and II.The areas of the respective valve members in the respective lap positions thereto presented between the diameters of the inlet and exhaust valve seats are compensated for in known manner by providing communications between the respective output pressure ports 4 and 5 and a small area 27 and 28 respectively created on the valve members. Referring now to the operation of the dual circOit40488 pressure control valve, the ports 2 and 3 are assumed to be connected to separate reservoirs each charged to a pressure of approximately 11 bar and in the position of the assembly as shown. the driver s foot pedal is released so that plunger 9 is at its upper stop position under the influence of the return springs 29 and 30 acting through piston 12 and springs 10 and 11.Upon depression of the driver s foot pedal the plunger 9 is moved in the d ownwards direction of the drawing, a force being transmitted through springs 10 and 11 to piston 12 thereby moving piston 12 downwards to close off exhaust seat 19 and unseat the inlet valve seat 17 from valve member 15 permitting reservoir pressure to be passed through port 2 to the output port 4, this pressure also acting above the piston 20. when the output pressure at port 4 acting on the effective area of the piston 12 is such as to compensate for the force of springs 10 and 11, the first valve moves to a lap postion. Considering now the second valve, the pressure acting on the top side of piston 27 urges the piston downwards to operate the second valve 22 by closing the exhaust seat 21 and opening the inlet seat 24 until the pressure buildup under the piston 20 is such as to drive the piston 20 upwards to a balanced position. The maximum output pressures of both valves in the normal working donciditons are limited by the amount of travel which is provided for the plunger 9 and determined by the combined rates of springs 10 and 11. Considering now a fault condition under which the source of pressure to the second valve at port 3 falls to zero pressure, the effect of t his is that owing to the lack of pressure in operation acting on the underside of piston 20, the upper or first valve assembly attains its lap condition at a position of the valve 12 which is lower than normal.Accordingly, the amount of compression which can be applied to springs 10 and 11 before plunger 9 reaches its lower stop is reduced and there would be a corresponding reduction of the available output pressure at port 4 were it not for the provision of the discreet area determined by the daimeters of the cylindrical walls 13 and 14 to which the circuit II pressure is normally applied. Since in the failure conditionhere envisaged the pressure is removed from port 8, the effective reaction area of piston 12 is reduced and this area reduction is suitably chosen to compensate for the reduced compression referred to above of springs 10 and 11.In the case of failure of the pressure source to the first valve at port 2, there is a resultant loss of reaction pressure on the underside of piston 12 and piston 12 moves downwards to engage piston 20 after first closing off exhaust valve seat 19. Piston 20, therefore, operates with direct mechanical connection to the springs 10 and 11 and the second valve laps at a pressure output to circuit II whereat equilibrium is established between this pressure acting under piston 20 submitted by the same pressure acting through port 8 on the annular area of piston 12 and the force of springs 10 and 11 as applied by the foot pedal Thus, circuit II continues to operate. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that by virtue of the present invention a tandem dual circuit pressure control valve can be provided wherein although a controlling member acting through a spring is given a limited travel to limit the available output pressure, an undesired pressure limitation on a first valve can be prevented from accompanying a failure of the second valve output, by applying the latter to a discreet predetermined area of a pressure responsive member associated with the first valve.
