# Reforming digital signals in integrated circuits.

## Abstract
Circuitry for reforming a distorted digital signal on a line 102,103 , of poly silicon for example, has a positive feed back circuit 301,302 connected to a specific point b on the line 102,103 . which detects commencement of the rise, or the fall, of a signal at that point and in response feeds the specific point with the potential V The positive feedback circuit and the positive feedback cut off circuit each comprise an inverter 301 303 and an MIS transistor 302 304 .
