# Process for the degradation of co polymers of propylene.

## Abstract
A process for the degradation of co polymers using as degradants chlorinated 1,1,2,2 tetramethyl 1, 2 diphenyl ethane chlorinated bicumyl and or derivatives thereof carry ing alkyl substituents in the aromatic nuclei. The present degradants generally are mixtures of bicumyls having vary ing degrees of chlorination. They may be employed in combi nation with usual antioxidants and or UV stabilizers and dis play higher activity than bicumyl itself.
