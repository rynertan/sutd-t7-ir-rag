# Article grouper for case packer.

## Abstract
Two chain conveyor systems 60, 62 have two sets of grouper pins X,Y mounted on flight bars 112, 118 at a predetermined pitch so that the pins X,Y move upwardly between articles fed through a common upper run of the chain conveyors 60, 62 . One chain conveyor system 60 is driven at a speed that varies sinusoidally and is synchronized with the speed of the articles. The other chain conveyor system 62 is driven through a differential means 70 so that its pins Y move at a speed which varies oppositely to the one chain conveyor system 60 .
