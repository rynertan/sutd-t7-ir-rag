## Description
PRODUCTION OF FINE SPHERICAL COPPER POWDER This invention relates to the production of fine copper powder, that is to say comprising particles with a size less than about 5 micrometres and with an average size of about 1 to about 3 micrometres. There is a commercial requirement for fine copper powder which is relatively oxygen free namely less than about 18 oxygen by weight, and which comprises substantially spherical and separate particles to provide a relatively high bulk density. It is difficult to obtain fine copper powder conforming to these requirements by use of known processes. Fine copper powder with acceptable physical properties can be produced by hydrogen reduction of an ammoniacal copper sulphate slurry in an autoclave.However, fine copper powder produced by such a process is usually found to contain an undesirably high amount of oxygen which is difficult to remove while at the same time preserving the desirable properties of the copper powder. It is also known to produce fine copper powder by causing the disproportionation of cuprous ions in accordance with the following reaction 2Cu EMI1.1 CuO Cu2 A process of this kind is described in Copper l Disproportionation Equilibrium in a Sulphuric Acid Medium at 100 2000C by Klyain et al, published in Izv. Vyssh. Ucheb.Zaved., Tsvet. Met. 1974, 17 3 , 27 32. It utilizes the known temperature dependence of the disproportionation equilibrium with the equilibrium being shifted with decreas ing temperature towards the formation of copper powder. A further process of this kind is described inBritish patent No. 1,381,666 published in January, 1975 and utilizes the fact that the disportionation equilibrium is shifted towards cuprous ion formation by the presence of an organic nitrile, with subsequent production of copper powder by removal of the nitrile. A Paper entitled wA New Chemical Process for theProduction of High Purity Copper Powder from Copper Sulphate or Copper Nitrate Solutions by Chupungco et al, published in Powder Metallurgy International Vol. 14, No. 4, 1982, describes a process comprising treating a cupric ammonium sulphate or nitrate complex with sulphur dioxide to precipitate a crystalline solid, which is then treated with sulphuric acid to produce metallic copper. However, for various reasons, none of these prior processes is particularly suitable for commercial production of fine copper powder with the properties referred to above. The present invention is based on the discovery that, when the disproportionation equilibrium is shifted towards cuprous ion formation by the presence of ammonia, the equilibrium can be shifted towards the formation of copper powder by the neutralization of ammonia with acid in a substantially oxygen free environment to produce fine copper powder with previously described desirable properties. It has been found that the starting cuprous ion complex should have an ammonium to cuprous ion concentration of at least 4 1 in order to stabilize the cuprous ions by formation of the tetrammoniacal cuprous ion Cu NH3 4 .The cuprous ion complex may be produced for example by dissolving metallic copper in an ammoniacal cupric salt solution in a substantially oxygen free atmosphere, preferably with an initial ammonia to copper molar ratio in the solution of at least 8 1 to maximize the formation of cuprous copper. An advantage of this feature is that the properties of the fine copper produced in accordance with the invention are independent of those of the metallic copper starting material. Alternatively, the starting cuprous ion complex may be produced by reduction of ammoniacal cupric salt solution with a reductant, for example hydrazine. The solution may conveniently be a sulphate solution. The treatment of ammoniacal cuprous salt solution with acid such as sulphuric acid may be carried out in an agitated container under an oxygen free atmosphere or by passing the ammoniacal cuprous salt solution through a pipeline reactor under turbulent conditions. The pH should be lowered to less than about 3, preferably to about 1.5 to 2.5. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows a flow diagram of a process for producing fine copper powder. Referring to the drawing, metallic copper material such as copper shot is contained in a tower 1 through which ammoniacal cupric sulphate solution is passed, the ammonia content of the solution being such that the ammonia to copper molar ratio is preferably about 8 1. The tower 1 is maintained at a temperature of at least 600C, preferably about 750 to 800, to promote dissolution of the copper to form a tetrammoniacal cuprous sulphate solution containing about 90 g L Cu and about 100 g L NH3 at a pH of about 9 in accordance with the following equation 8NH3 CuSO4 Cu0 tCu NH3 12SO Approximately one half of the tetrammoniacal cuprous sulphate solution from the top of the tower 1 is mixed with sulphuric acid solution and passed through a water cooled pipeline reactor 2 through which the mixed solutions flow in turbulent manner to lower the pH to 1.5 to 2.5 with resultant disproportionation of the cuprous ions to produce copper powder in accordance with the following equation ICu NH3 ql2S04 4H2S04 5 Cu0 CuSO4 4 NH4 2SO4 The resultant slurry is then passed to a thickener 3, the underflow being fine copper powder which is then filtered, washed and dried in an oxygenfree atmosphere. The overflow solution from the thickener 3 contains copper sulphate and ammonium sulphate. This solution may for example be treated with hydrogen sulphide to precipitate copper sulphide and recover ammonium sulpate solution, or treated with lime to precipitate gypsum and produce ammonium cupric sulphate solution. The other half of the cuprous ion complex solution from the top of the tower 1 is mixed with air and passed through an oxidation reactor in the form of a pipeline reactor 4 to oxidize the cuprous ion complex to a cupric ion complex which, with the addition of ammonia and water, is returned to the bottom of the tower 1. Xy means of such a process in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to produce copper powder with a bulk density of up to 4.0 g cm3, with an average particle size of two or three micrometres, and an oxygen content of less than 1 by weight. It is also possible to produce fine copper powder with such properties and containing less than 0.02 sulphur. Further, when the starting copper material is contaminated with other elements such as nickel, cobalt, arsenic or antimony, it has been found that the fine copper powder produced contains only minimal amounts of such elements. Another anion, such as for example Cl could be used instead of S042 in the described process if desired. Other examples and embodiments of the invention will be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art from the foregoing description.
