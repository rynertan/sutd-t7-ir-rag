# Optical beam splitting apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical beam splitting apparatus for generating multiple linear images of an illuminated object line 20 and focusing the images A , B onto an image plane. The multiple images are generated on the object side of the lens 26 using an optical beam splitting arrangement such as mirros 24,25 . In a preferred embodiment, the images are converted into electrical signals after focusing onto photosensor arrays 27,28 .
