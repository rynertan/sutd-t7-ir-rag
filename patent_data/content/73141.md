# Method for promoting the activity and or extending the life of cation exchangeable layered clay catalysts in proton catalysed reactions.

## Abstract
A method for promoting the activity and or extending the life of a cation exchangeable layered clay catalyst in reactions susceptible to catalysis by protons which method comprises the addition to the catalyst of water as the sole additive. The quantity of water employed is suitably up to 40 preferably up to 10 based on weight of reactants. The layered clay catalyst can be for example montmorillonite, bentonite or vermiculite. Suitable proton catalysed reactions include formation of esters, eg by reaction of olefin and carboxylic acid , ethers, aldehydes, thioethers and alkylation and cracking reactions.
