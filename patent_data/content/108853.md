## Description
3 TRIMETHOXYSILYL PROPYLDIDECYLMETHYL AMMONIUM SALTS ANDMETHOD OF INHIBITING GROWTH OF MICROORGANISMS THEREWITH The present invention relates to certain silyl quaternary ammonium salts and a method of inhibiting the growth pf bacteria and fungi therewith. In particular, the invention relates to the use of such salts as bactericidal or fungicidal agents on textiles or other substrates. EMI2.1 It is well known in the art that organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds possess bacteriostatic, fungistatic and algaestatic and or bactericidal, fungicidal and algaecidal properties. See, for example, U.S.Patents Nos. 3,560,385 3,730,701 3,794,736 3,817,739 3,865,728 and 4,005,025 and British Patent No.1,386,876. Thus, U.S. Patent No. 3,730,701 discloses a variety of silyl quaternary ammonium compounds having a single long chain alkyl radical of from 11 to 22 carbon atoms. For example, one such compound, 3 trimethoxysilyl propyl octadecyldimethyl ammonium chloride is a commercial antimicrobial product marketed by Dow Corning as RBioguard Q 9 5700 EPA No. 34292 1 . U.S. Patent No. 3,794,736 describes a number of other organosilicon amines and salts thereof exhibiting antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of organisms. In accordance with this invention there are provided a number of silyl quaternary ammonium salts which have equal or greater antimicrobial activity than the previously known compounds. EMI3.1 The present invention relates to certain silyl quaternary ammonium salts, particularly 3 trimethoxy silyl propyldidecylmethyl ammonium 3alts, e.g., the flu and phosphate oxide, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, EMI3.2 acetate r thereof, and their use as fungicides and bactericides on a variety of substances having reactive surfaces, particularly textile fabrics and fibers. As used herein, the term substances having reactive surfaces or surface reactive substrate s is meant to include any material whose surface is able to form covalent chemical bonds with the didecylmethyl substituted silyl quaternary ammonium compounds of the invention.It has now been found that these didecylmethyl substituted ammonium compounds more effectively inhibit the growth of such microorganisms, including, for example, both various gram positive and gram negative bacteria, than their known adjacent homologs. While the specific site of action of the organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds is still under investigation it is known that the compounds are chemically bonded to a variety of reactive surfaces and are not removed therefrom by repeated leaching or washing with water. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful to impart durable bioactive properties to surfaces like natural and synthetic textile fibers, siliceous materials like glass, stone and ceramics metals and also, leather, wood, plastic and the like. Generally, the surface reactive materials are treated by contacting the same with the bioactive compound, e.g., by either dipping, spraying, padding, or brushing the compound of the present invention onto the substrates either prior to infestation by microorganisms to prevent the growth thereof, or after infestation to kill and to prevent new growth thereof. The compounds of the present invention are active in solution as well as when applied to solid surfaces. The antimicrobial compounds may thus be employed as the pure compounds, in aqueous solution or dispersion, or in organic solvent media. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are dissolved in a suitable organic water miscible solvent forming a solution containing about 50 of the compound of the present invention as active ingredient. EMI5.1 In accordance with the present invention it has been found that 3 trimethoxysilyl propyldidecylmethyl ammonium salts exhibit antimicrobial properties which are superior to those of their known adjacent homologs. Such materials are thus useful for a variety of bactericidal, fungicidal and the like applications for which the use of silyl quaternary ammonium compounds has previously been proposed. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by known methods. Thus, the tertiary amine, i.e.,didecylmethyl amine, is reacted with an appropriate silane, e.g., 3 chloropropyltrimethoxysilane with or without the presence of a suitable solvent such as methanol.The alkylation reaction of the tertiary amine proceeds smoothly resulting in the production of 3 trimethoxysilyl propyldidecylmethyl ammonium chloride. Of course, other silanes may be similarly reacted to form other qua ternary ammonium halides, e.g., the fluoride, bromide, or iodide. within the score of the invention. Similarly, eo silanes incorporating sulfatesEMI5.2 acetate7anions may be converted to the corresponding quaternary ammonium salts, within the purview hereof. Alternatively, the salts of the present invention mav be treated bv reactinq didecylamines with the or phosphate trimethoxysilylpropylhalide, sulfatelez acetatelrin the presence of sodium methyl ate to yield the corresponding tertiary amines which are subsequently methylated to form the organosilicon quaternary ammonium salts. A further method for preparing the compound of the present invention includes the preparation of the allyldidecylamine, followed by hydrosilylation thereof with trimethoxysilane to produce 3 didecylamino propyltrimethoxysilane, which is then treated with an appropriate methyl halide to yield the compound of the present invention. The preferred compound, 3 trimethoxysilyl propyldidecylmethyl ammonium chloride, may directly contact the surface of the material to be treated by either spraying or brushing, or the surface reactive substrate may be immersed in the pure antimicrobial compound or in a solution thereof in an appropriate solvent. Surface reactive materials or substrates to which the compound of the invention can be chemically bonded include siliceous materials and metallic surfaces.Leather, wood, rubber and plastic have also been shown to have reactive surfaces. Indeed, the preferred class of substrates having reactive surfaces to which the compound of the invention can readily bond comprises the natural and synthetic textile fibers and the corresponding fabrics thereof. Such natural fibers include cotton, wool, linen and felt similarly bondable synthetic fibers include those comprised wholly of synthetic polymeric material such as viscose, cellulose acetate or triacetate or nylons, polyether, vinyl polymers, including polyolefins, acrylics and modacrylics or the like or blends of such materials with natural fibers. Suitable solvents in which the compound of the invention may be dissolved for bactericidal, fungicidal or similar applications include water and organic water miscible solvents like alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol and butanol methyl Cellosolve and ethyl Cellosolve ketones, such as methylethyl ketone. For textile treatment, solvents used in commercial dry cleaning processes, such as hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers and benzene may alternatively be used. As disclosed hereinabove, the active compound of the present invention may be applied to a variety of surfaces by any suitable means. For example, it is possible to spray the antimicrobial compound into shoes to inhibit or prevent growth of microorganisms therein. The pure compound or a solution thereof may also be applied to walls to prevent mold and mildew, or may be added to fillers used in paints to prepare paints with antimicrobial properties. For treating textiles, the compound may be dispersed in the solvents used in commercial dry cleaning processes and thus be readily brought into contact with textiles to be treated.Alternatively, the active compound may be applied to textile fabrics or fibers by exhaustion techniques, involving the use of closed systems in which the fibers or fabrics to be treated are immersed in a treating bath under preferably slightly elevated temperature conditions to effect absorption and fixation of the bioactive compound on the textile fibers and thus exhaust the same from the bath. Such techniques are more fully described, for example, in my prior U.S. PatentNo. 3,788,803. Another preferred method for applying the bioactive compound of the present invention to fabrics or textile fibers is by padding. The fabric to be treated may be immersed in a trough or padder containing a solution of the antimicrobial compound. The concentration of the active ingredient in the solution is adjusted depending upon the ability of the substrate to pick up the antimicrobial compound from the bath. Of course, finishing agents such as a softening agent or the like may be added to either the exhaustion or the padding bath. Thus, in the preferred embodiments of the present invention for applying the antimicrobial compound of the invention to textile fibers or fabrics, the fibers or fabrics are immersed in a bath containing the compound in pure or dissolved form for a period of from about 3 5 minutes to about 20 30 minutes at temperatures of from about 250 to 950 C., and preferably from about 400 to 700C. The amount of bioactive compound thus bonded to the textile fibers may vary, depending on the solvent and the particular structure of the textile employed. The active ingredient may be applied in an amount of from about 0.1 to 1.08 by weight of a textile substrate.Upon removal of the textile fibers from such an exhaustion or padding bath, the treated material may be dried in accordance with conventional practice in the art, thereafter woven, knitted, or otherwise converted to piece goods if treated in fibrous form , and subjected to conventional finishing operations.

The resulting yellow orange solution contained 50 wt. active material.Example 3 Comparison of Antibacterial Activity of 3 Tr imethoxysilyl propyldidecylmethyl Ammonium Chloride With The Activity Of Other Di Long Chain Alkyl Substituted Organo Silicon Quaternary Ammonium Compounds Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria The activity of the compound of Example 1 was compared with various higher and lower adjacent homologs against a gram positive Staph aureus ATCC 6538 and gram positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352 strain. 10 ml of a 10 aqueous solution of each bactericide tested was prepared. Four serial dilutions were made by pipeting 1 ml of each 10 solution into a 10 ml volumetric flask and filling to the mark with water. 0.1 ml of each serial dilution was added to 9.9 ml of sterile molten nutrient agar in tubes which were maintained at 470C. in a water bath. 0.1 ml of blank water was added to 9.9 ml of sterile molten nutrient agar to serve as a control. 0.1 ml aliquots of a 24 hour culture of each test organism were pipeted into six sterile petri dishes previously labeled 1000, 100, 10 , 1 and 0.1 and control organism. The contents of each tube was then poured into its respective petri dish, swirled and allowed to solidify. The petri dishes were incubated, inverted, for 48 hours at 370C.The results were as follows TABLE I Gram Positive Organism Gram Negative Organism Stash Aureus R.
