# Work platform for ships.

## Abstract
A stable offshore platform for surface or undersea work is provided by connecting a semi submersible trailer unit 10 with a workboat 21 . Preferably, two columns 14 of the trailer are joined by a beam member or truss 14 , and this assembly is linked to the work boat via a truss like trailer tongue 17 with a ball swivel joint 19 . When in transit, the semi submersible unit is deballasted to a shallow draft condition and towed by the workboat.
