# Beam projector for wheel aligner.

## Abstract
A projector is disclosed which is constructed as an integral part of a wheel alignment head for use in an alignment system for the wheels supporting a vehicle chassis. The projector causes a beam to be emitted from the back of the alignment head toward the supporting wheels at the opposite end of the chassis. The projector is configured so that the direction of the projected beam relative to a reference direction may e adjusted within about plus or minus 5 of arc by turning a manually accessible adjustment knob. The adjustment knob also causes a corresponding adjustment to a signal generator so that a signal output is obtained therefrom which is indicative of the angular departure of the beam from the referenced direction.
