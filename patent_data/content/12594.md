# Self purging seal.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a self purging seal assembly for a magnetic separator. An annular matrix passes through a series of magnetic processing stations, where fluid is passed through the matrix which retains magnetic particles. The matrix also passed through a series of nonmagnetic flush stations where the par ticles are flushed out of the matrix. The seal assembly seals the space between the matrix and a sealing surface at the processing stations. The seal assembly Fig. 6B includes a base portion 202 and inner and outer salient lip portions 206, 204 which engage sealing surfaces. The lip portions are spaced apart to form a channel 208 which with one of the sealing surfaces 97a or 99a forms a pressurised purge fluid chamber. The height of the lip portion is greater than the gap be tween the matrix and the sealing surfaces to cause the lips to be bent inwardly. Thus, fluid in the chamber will cause the in ner lip to flex to permit purging fluid to escape into the matrix and clean the inner lip portion, while the same pressure will form the outer lip portion against its associates sealing sur face. If desired, an inflatable passage 210 can be provided below the base. Inflating or deflating this passage can also control the contact pressure between the lip portions and thus a mounted sealing surface.
