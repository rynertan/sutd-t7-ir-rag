## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESS This invention relates to a chemical process for the production of 3 thienylmalonic acid, a compound useful as an intermediate in the production of penicillins of general formula I EMI1.1 The compound of formula I in which R is hydrogen is disclosed in our British Patent No. 1,004,670, and the sodium salt thereof is known as ticarcillin.Compounds of formula I in which R is an alkyl, aralkyl or ring substituted aralkyl group are disclosed in our British Patent No. 1,125,557 and compounds of formula I in which R is aryl are disclosed in our British Patent No. 1,133,886. In British Patent No. 1,125,557 the penicillin of formula I was prepared from a 3 thienylmalonic ester itself synthesised from 3 thienylacetonitrile via 3 thienylacetic acid and a diester of 3 thienylmalonic acid. It has now been found that 3 thienylmalonic acid can be prepared in good yield in a onestep process directly from a 3 thienyl cyanoacetate, via the intermediate precipitation of an alkali metal or ammonium salt ot 3 thienylmalonic acid. Accordingly the present invention.provides a salt of 3 thienylmalonic acid of formulaII EMI1.2 wherein M represents an alkali metal ion or an ammonium ion, NH4. Suitable alkali metal ions include sodium, potassium and lithium. A preferred compound of formula II is the monosodium salt of 3 thienylmalonic acid, which appears to exist in the form of the monohydrate. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of 3 thienylmalonic acid of formula III EMI2.1 which process comprises hydrolysing a 3 thienylcyanoacetate of formula IV EMI2.2 where RÚ represents an alkyl or aryl group, with an alkali metal hydroxide, isolating a compound of formula II above and converting it to 3 thienylmalonic acid. In compound IV , the group may suitably be C16 alkyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl. The groupR1 is preferably C16 alkyl, for example methyl or ethyl, especially ethyl. The compound IV may be prepared by conventional methods, for example by treatment of 3 thienylacetonitrile with a compound of formula RÚO.CO.ORÚ in the presence of a strong base such as an alkali metal alkoxide, particularly sodium methoxide. Alternatively anhydrides of formula RÚ .CO.O.CO.RÚ or chloroformic esters of formula Cl.CO2RÚ may be used in the presence of an alkali metal alkoxide. The process of the present invention employs an alkali metal hydroxide. Suitable such hydroxides include sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The most suitable solvent for this hydrolysis reaction is water although it is possible to add a co solvent.The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature greater than 400C. In general if the temperature is maintained at 750 to 800C the hydrolysis is complete in about 2 2.5 hours. At a higher temperature, for example 1000 to 1100C, the time of the hydrolysis is reduced to about 30 to 40 minutes. It is preferred that a means is provided for removing ammonia vapour which is evolved during the reaction of the invention. This may be achieved for example by blowing an inert gas such as nitrogen through the reaction mixture or by evacuating the space above the reaction mixture. If no such means is provided for removing the ammonia, the process proceeds more slowly. After the hydrolysis reaction is complete the compound of formula II may be isolated by washing with a water immiscible solvent such as methyl isobutyl ketone, conveniently at pH 5.5 to 6 to remove by products from the reaction, then acidifying the reaction mixture, for example with hydrochloric acid, and extracting the resulting aqueous solution containing 3 thienylmalonic acid into a water immiscible solvent, such as methyl isobutyl ketone. The salt of formula II may be precipitated from such a solution by adding an alkali metal or ammonium salt of an alkanoic acid.A preferred such salt is an alkali metal or ammonium ethyl hexoate, in particular sodium ethyl hexoate, and it is suitably added in solution in the same solvent as that containing the crude 3 thienylmalonic acid. The salt of 3 thienyl malonate which is thus precipitated need not be further purified. Its precipitation alone is sufficient to remove impurities from the reaction mixture which would otherwise impede the isolation of 3 thienylmalonic acid. The isolated salt of formula II may conveniently be converted into the free acid, 3 thienylmalonic acid, by conventional methods, for example by treatment of an aqueous solution thereof with hydrochlorice acid. It is often preferable to seed the solution with a crystal of 3 thienylmalonic acid in order to encourage crystallisation. The conversion of 3 thienylmalonic acid to a penicillin of formula I may be carried out by any convenient method. In particular, those methods described in British Patent specification Nos. 1,004,670, 1,125,557, 1,133,886 and 1,197,973 may be used to advantage. An important advantage of the process of this invention is that the starting materials may be employed in crude form. For example the 3 thienylcyanoacetate of formula IV may be used in 70 0 or less purity. If 3 thienylmalonic acid is prepared from such impure starting materials by direct precipitation from aqueous or organic solvents, without the intermediate isolation of the salts of formula II of this invention, the resulting 3 thienylmalonicis coloured and impure.The present process therefore has considerable commercial advantages in that 3 thienylmalonic acid can be prepared in pure form using starting materials in unpurified crude form. The following Examples illustrate the present invention.
