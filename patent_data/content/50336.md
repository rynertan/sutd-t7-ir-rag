# Panel file used for storage of mainly rectangular relatively thin sheets, in particular microfiche.

## Abstract
A panel file used for storage of mainly rectangular relatively thin plates, particularly micro film plates or so called microfiche, comprising three foil layers welded the one to the other, namely a foremost cover foil 4 in which a plurality of slits 5 are formed parallel to each other and extending transversally to the foil 4 , said slits being provided at the center of the foil 4 with an upwardly open cut 6 , an intermediate support foil in which a number of retaining straps 9 are form ed having two inclined diverging legs 10 extending downwards, which legs are connected to each other at the stem by a transversal binding element 11 extending crosswise to the foil, and a rearmost second cover foil 4 that corresponds to the first cover foil 4 but having slits 5 that are displaced in the longitudinal direction of the panel 1 at a distance that corresponds to about half the distance a between two slits 5 . A panel file thus constructed makes it possible by means of three foil layers only aid by using one weld ing operation in manufacturing to store as many micro fiche as the hitherto known panel files comprising 4 foil layers and requiring at least two welding operations and or three welding operations and an intermediate turning of the subject.

## Description
PANEL FILE USED FOR STORAGE OF MAINLY RECTANGULARRELATIVELY THIN SHEETS, IN PARTICULAR MICROFICHETECHNICAL FIELDAs a consequence of the much increased use of microphotography in connection with the storage of. information, filing and the like, a need has emerged for a suitable storage means for films. Normally, the films are stored in pockets or small compartments depending on the shape and size of the film negative to be stored. These pockets or compartments are often formed upon a larger sheet designed to be placed in suitable boxes or ring binders.A commonly known problem in connection with storage and filing is that only a very restricted number of micro film plates can be stored compared with the size of the carrying sheet, as it is necessary for the user to be able to read the information printed on the top part of the micro film plate.BACKGROUND ARTA panel file constructed so that it is possible to store 15 standardized micro film plates on each side of the panel and in a manner such that the user easily can read the information printed on the upper margin of the plates is known from Swedish patent application No. 14524 72. The panel file according to said Swedish patent application comprises a total of four foil layers welded together at the edges, namely an outermost cover foil in which slits are cut for insertion of the micro film plates, a support foil in which a mainly inverted V shaped retaining strap is formed for each slit, a corresponding underlying support foil and a rear cover foil. The mentioned inverted V shaped retaining straps are welded to the respective cover foils immediately beneath their slits.Through the welding process pockets are formed, each destined to receive its individual micro film plate, said pockets being limited by the slit in the cover foil and by the inverted V shaped strap in the underlying support foil welded to said cover foil.However, the panel file known from said Swedish patent application is manufactured in a relatively complicated manner, as the four foils are first welded together in pairs and then. in a further operation the resulting parts are welded together.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONThe object of the present invention is to provide a panel file for the purpose mentioned in the introduction, however, one that can be produced by means of fewer foil layers and fewer manufacturing stages than in the case of the hitherto known panel files, at the same time being capable of storing the same number of micro film plates or similar on each panel side.This object is achieved according to the invention by a panel file utilized when storing mainly rectangular relatively thin plates, in particular micro film plates, which panel comprises foil layers partly welded the one to the other, which layers in combination form insertion pockets on both sides of the sheet for receiving the plates, and which panel is characteristic in that it comprises three foil layers, namely a first cover foil, in which a plurality of straight slits are formed parallel to each other and extending transversally to the foil, said slits provided at the center of the foil with an upwardly open cut, an intermediate support foil, in which a number of retaining straps are formed having two inclined diverging legs extending downwards, said legs being connected to each other at the stem by a transversal binding element extending crosswise to the foil, and a rearmost second cover foil corresponding to the first cover foil, but having slits that are displaced in the longitudinal direction of the sheet at a distance that corresponds t9 half the distance between two slits.By placing the upwardly open cuts in the cover. foils suits ably in relation to the transversal binding element in the intermediate support foil, one welding operation suffices for welding the three foils, as the transversal binding elements can be welded alternately to the foremost cover foil and the rearmost cover foil by spot welding.Naturally, in the same welding operation the three foils can be welded together at the margins in a manner known per se, providing the welding tool is appropriately designed.Thus, a panel file according to the invention can be manufactured by punching the foremost cover foil and the rearmost cover foil using the same punching tool, and by punching the intermediate support foil using another punching tool, whereupon the three punched foils are welded in one welding operation only, where in case of the hitherto known panel files of similar types, it is necessary to punch four sheets, and to begin by welding these in pairs in order finally in a new welding operation to weld the semi products thus manufactured.In a preferred embodiment, the straps of the support foil are formed in two inclined sets, each set forming a plurality of parallel extending lines at uniform distance from each other and placed symmetrically on either side of the longitudinal central axes of the foil, whereby the inclined lines diverging away from each other are connected by transversal lines extending at right angles to the longitudinal axis, said transversal lines also being parallel and equidistant to each other in the longitudinal direction of the foil.This construction makes it possible to obtain retaining straps having the same width of legs and the same height at the transversal binding element between the inclined legs, this being necessary in order to obtain uniform strength at the retaining straps in the individual insertion pockets. The horizontally extending transversal binding elements that become wider and wider from the lower part of the panel towards the top part of the panel result in the maintaining of sufficient strength at the top part of the straps whereby retaining straps in a number hitherto unknown can be formed in relation to the size of the support foil. Compared to the construction of the Swedish application No. 14523 72, mentioned in the introduction, which, as stated, comprises inverted V shaped retaining straps in the support foils, twice as many retaining straps now can be placed on the same area. According to the invention, the cuts by the slits in the foremost and the rearmost cover foils can be of a size, such that a substantial part of the respective transversal binding elements is freed when the first and the second cover foils are fitted to the support foil.In this manner it is possible to bring the welding tool into contact with the transversal binding element at the straps of the support foil and with the respective support foil, the coverfoil, moreover, uncovering at the same time the entire intermediate support foil.According to the invention, every second retaining strap can be welded to the first cover foil and the second cover foil,respectively,by welding together the transversal binding elements of the straps and the cover foils between two areas situated between two succeeding slits.In this design, the cover foils can be welded together with the support foil in a manner such that every second strap in the support foil is used to form an insertion pocket in combination with the slit in the first or foremost cover foil, while every second strap is used to form an insertion pocket in combination with the second or rearmost cover foil. The vertical distance between the slits in the two cover foils is measured in a manner such that there is a possibility of reading the top part of the micro film plate, when it is placed in the insertion pocket.In a preferred embodiment of a panel file according to the invention, the straight slits end at both sides in inclined downwards extending hooklike prolongations that are open upwards.These hooklike prolongations facilitate insertion of the micro film plates, as it is possible to widen the effective insertion opening by placing a finger at the top part of the slit and thereby pulling the part of the cover foil that lies beneath the slit outwards and away from the plane of the storage panel. The bending at the end of the hooklike prolongation counteracts the tendency of the support foil to tear when inserting and removing the micro film plates.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe invention is further described with reference to the drawing, in which fig. 1 shows a panel file designed according to the inven tion viewed towards the top cover foil, fig. 2 a cover foil belonging to a panel file according to the present invention, and fig. 3 a support foil according to the invention provided with retaining straps. BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONThe panel file shown in fig. 1 comprises three foil layers welded together. At its left margin the panel file is provided with holes 2 in a manner known per se, which makes it possible to place the panel file in a ring binder. In the embodiment shown, the right margin is provided with a longitudinal insertion pocket 3 designed to receive a cardboard strip or the like upon which notes can be taken. As shown, horizontal slits 5 are formed in the top cover foil 4 extending in parallel and spaced equidistantly in relation to each other in the longitudinal direction of the panel file. At the central area of the slits 5, cuts 6 are formed, open upwardly, and at each side of the slits 5 hooklike prolongations 7 are provided.The foremost and the rearmost cover foils are clearly shown in figure 2. It appears from this figure that the lowest slit 5 is placed a considerable distance above the lower margin of the foil, which distance corresponds mainly to the height of a standardized micro film carrier. It should be noticed that the rearmost cover foil has slits 5, which in relation to the margin of the foil are displaced at a distance corresponding to approximately half of the horizontal distance between two slits in the longitudinal direction of the panel in relation to the slits in the foremost cover foil. Apart from this, the twovfoils are identical and can thus be manufactured by means of the same punching tool.In fig. 1 of the drawing, the spot welding between the first cover foil 4 and the transversal binding elements 11 of the support foil 8, and the spot welding between the second cover foil 4 and the transversal binding elements 11 of the support foil 8 are indicated by 12 and 13,respective ly.Fig. 3 of the drawing shows the intermediate support foil 8.As shown in fig. 3, a plurality of retaining straps 9 are punched so that they lie in parallel above each other said straps consisting of two inclined downwardly diverging legs 10 and a transversal binding element 11 placed at the stem of said legs and forming a bridge. As it appears from fig. 3, the width of the legs of all the retaining straps 9 lying above each other is constant. Furthermore, the height of the transversal binding elements 11 that are also situated above each other is constant. Thus, the characteris tic form shown in the figure appears with inclined outwardly diverging border lines of the retaining straps and increasing width of the transversal binding elements in the longitudinal direction of the panel. In the embodiment shown in the drawing 29 retaining straps are punched in the support foil, whereby 15 insertion pockets are formed both on the.first or foremost cover foil and on the second or rearmost cover foil.The invention is not limited to the features shown and just described, and it will be possible, for instance, to place several sets of retaining straps and slits next to each other in one and the same panel, if the dimensions of the plates intended for storage in relation to the size of the panel file open up the possibility therefore, and this cannot be said to be outside the scope of the invention.
