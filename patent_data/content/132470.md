## Description
SAFETY BOILER lATH HIGH EFFICIENCY Conventional boilers either fire tube type or water tube type are generally found with the following defects 1. In order to sustain the high pressure of generated steam, all the construction parts should be designed with suitable thickness durable for such high steam pressure, which can not be reduced to be thinner so that the production cost of boiler will not be reduced. 2, The heat conductivity of such thicker steel plates or tubes will be reduced so as to decrease the thermal efficiency of boiler, 3. The outmost boiler shell should be insulated to prevent heat loss therefrom to increase insulation cost and maintenance problem for the insulated material as the boiler shell still carry an appreciated heat which should be well insulated. 4, The boiler shell directly receives the high pressure of steam inside the boiler so that, once accidental explosion occuring, the outer broken scraps will directly and rapidly spread outwards to cause serious damage to the surroundings, I have found these defects of conventional boilers and invented the present safety boiler with high efficiency, According to the present invention there is provided a surety boiler wherein a plurality of water jackets are disposed around a central vaporiing chamber positioned atop on a combustion chamber and a plurality of sandwiched flues are provided each being respectively partitioned between each two neighbouring water jackets so that the feed water passing the water jackets will be thoroughly preheated to increase the thermal efficiency of the boiler.
