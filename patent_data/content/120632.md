# Improved oxide bond for aluminum oxide coated cutting tools.

## Abstract
The bond between a hard wear resistant coating of Al₂O₃ and a cemented carbide substrate is greatly improved by means of a more effective interlayer of TiO. The TiO layer is provided by means of a reduction process from other titanium oxides such as TiO₂.
