## Description
TITLE An Improved High Solids Coating Composition Of A Low Molecular Weight Acrylic Polymer And A Nitrogen Resin Cross Linking Agent, And A Substrate Coated Therewith BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is related to high solids coating compositions, in particular, to an improved high solids acrylic coating compositions. Acrylic coating compositions that are crosslinked with melamine resins are well known in the art as shown by Vasta U.S. Patent 3,622,651, issuedNovember 23, 1971 Hick U.S. Patent 3,841,895, issuedOctober 15, 1974 Parker U.S. Patent 3,674,734, issuedJuly 4, 1972 and Parker U.S. Patent 3,637,546, issuedJanuary 25, 1972. These patents illustrate high quality coating compositions. However, these compositions have a relatively high solvent content to provide for good application properties and good properties of the resulting dried finish. To utilize these compositions in areas which have strict air pollution regulations, pollution abatement equipment is required. This equipment is expensive and increases capital investment of a plant and is costly to operate.Any attempt to reduce the solvent content of these compositions generally results in finishes which have either a poor appearance or unacceptable properties or both. It has been found that these acrylic coating compositions provide an excellent appearance along with depth of color and metallic glamour when a clear or transparent coat of the compositions is applied over a conventional colored or pigmented coat. However, the weatherability and durability of these clear coats have been found to be poor since checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat occur after relatively short periods of exposure to outdoor weathering, giving the automobile or truck an unsightly appearance. Refinishing of these weathered clear coats is difficult and expensive since the clear coat must be sanded to remove cracked and flaked clear coat before a refinish coat can be applied. There is great need for an acrylic coating composition that has a low solvent content and that can be utilized without pollution abatement equipment but still provides a high quality finish that is resistant to outdoor weathering which is useful as an exterior finish for automobiles, trucks, and airplanes and as a clear coat color coat finish. The high solids coating composition of this invention has these desirable characteristics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The improved high solids coating composition comprises at least 50 by weight of a binder of filmforming constituents and up to 50 by weight of a nonaqueous liquid carrier in which the film forming constituents consist essentially of A about 50 9596 by weight of an acrylic polymer having a number average molecular weight determined by gel per meation chromotography of about 500 10,000 and preferably 500 4,500, a hydroxyl content of about 2 10 by weight, a glass transition temperature of about 200C to 200C and contains about 2 10 by weight of a chain transfer agent, and the acrylic polymer consists essentially of an alkyl methacrylate that has 1 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, a hydroxy alkyl acrylate, or a hydroxy alkyl methacrylate each having 2 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, and optionally, an alkyl acrylate that has 2 18 carbons in the alkyl group or styrene and B 5 50 by weight of alkylated melamine formaldehyde cross linking agent having 1 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group the improvement used therewith comprises the inclusion of about 0.1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder of the coating composition, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer optionally, the coating composition contains about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer and about 0.1 5 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an antioxidant. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The high solids coating composition has a binder content of film forming constituents of at least 50 by weight. Generally, the composition has a binder content of about 60 85 . The remaining constituent in the composition is a liquid carrier which generally is a solvent for the binder.In addition, the composition optionally contains about 0.1 30 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of pigment. The improvement used with the high solids coating composition is the addition to the coating composition of about 0.1 208 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer. Optionally, the composition can contain about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an ultraviolet light stabilizer and about 0.1 5 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of an antioxidants preferably,the weight ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to an antioxidant is about 1 1 to about 50 1. The binder of film forming constituents used in the coating composition comprise about 50 95 by weight of an acrylic polymer and 5 5096 by weight of an alkylated melamine formaldehyde cross linking agent. For most uses, the composition contains about 65 75 by weight of the acrylic polymer and 25 3596 by weight of an alkylated melamine formaldehyde cross linking agent. The acrylic polymer utilized in the coating composition is prepared by solution polymerization in which the monomers are blended with a solvent, polymerization catalyst and chain transfer agent and heated to about 75 1500C for 2 6 hours to form a polymer that has a number average molecular weight of about 500 10,000 and preferably about 500 4,500, a hydroxyl content of 2 1096 by weight and a glass transition temperature of about 200C to 200C.Generally, acrylic polymers having a number average molecular weight of about 1,000 3,500 are preferred and used in the composition. Generally, it has been found that to provide a coating composition with good application characteristics, acrylic polymers are used having a glass transition temperature that is lower than the glass.transition temperatures of polymers used in conventional acrylic enamels. To form films that have acceptable physical properties from low molecular weight acrylic polymers, the polymers must have a hydroxyl content that is about two to three times higher than acrylic polymers used for conventional thermosetting compositions. The higher hydroxyl content provides additional crosslinking sites and films are formed that have excellent physical properties that are equivalent to and often better than films formed from conventional thermosetting acrylic compositions. Both the above number average molecular weight and the weight average molecular weight mentioned hereinafter are determined by gel permeation chromatography. The glass transition temperature of the polymer is determined by differential scanning colorimetry or is calculated. One technique that is successfully used in preparing the low molecular weight acrylic polymers is a programmed addition of monomers, solvents, catalyst solution, and chain transfer agent into a polymerization vessel at a given rate. These programmed additions can be manually calculated or calculated by a computer. This allows for the polymerization of low molecular weight acrylic polymers which are then terminated with the chain transfer agent at the desired low molecular weight.

Generally, about 0.1 2 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents, of acid catalyst is used.

Typical epoxy resins that can be used to form these adducts are Epon 828, 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004,which are the condensation products of epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A. Other compounds can be used to form adducts of these acids such as alkyl oxazolidine, e.q., dimethyl oxazolidine. The coating composition of this invention can be applied over a variety of substrates, such as metal, wood, glass, plastics, and the like, by any of the conventional application methods, such as spraying electrostatic spraying, dipping, brushing, flow coating and the like. The viscosity of the composition can be adjusted for any of these methods by adding solvents if necessary. Generally, the composition is utilized at a high solids content which keeps air pollution at a minimum level. The coatings are baked at relatively low temperatures of about 65 1400C. for about 15 minutes2 hours. The resulting coating is about 0.1 5 mils thick but for most uses, a 1 3 mil thick coating is used. One technique that is used to insure that there will be no popping or cratering of the coating is to allow the solvents to flash off for about 15 30 seconds before a second coating is sprayed on or otherwise applied, then waiting from about 2 10 minutes before baking the coating toa llow any residual solvents to flash off. The resulting coatings has good gloss and can be rubbed or polished with conventioanl techniques to improve the smoothness or appearance or gloss or both. The coating has good adhesion to substrates of all types, is hard and resistant to weathering, solvents, alkali, scratches and the like.These characteristics make the composition particularly useful as a finish for automobiles, trucks, airplanes, railroad equipment and for the repair of trucks and autoobiles. The composition can also be used on appliances, vending machines, outdoor equipment such as bridges, water tanks, gas tanks and the like. One particular use for the composition is that it can be used to repair powder coating finishes, in particular powder coating finishes which are pigmented with flake pigments, such as aluminum flake pigments. Excellent matches between the finish from the powder coating and the finish of the novel composition are achieved which makes the composition particularly useful as a repair composition. ten the coating carçosition is used as clear coat color coat finish for substrates in which the color coat contains an ultraviolet light stabilizer, it is believed that ultraviolet light stabilizer migrates from the color coat into the clear coat and provides ultraviolet light stabilizer to the clear coat for protection against weathering. Preferably, both the clear coat and the color coat contain ultraviolet light stabilizer and as stabilizer is lost from the clear coat due to weathering, it is replenished from the color coat. The color coat provides a reservoir for the ultraviolet light stabilizer for the clear coat and maintains the stabilizer at an effective level that provides protection from weathering. Applicant does not wish to be held to the above theory. As pointed out above, the color coat can contain an antioxidant which also migrates to the clear coat. The antioxidant can also be used in the clear coat. Preferred, to form a durable finish, about 5 896 by weight of the ultraviolet light stabilizer is used along with about 0.1 1 by weight of the antioxidant and the ratio of ultraviolet light stabilizer to antioxidant is about 10 1. In a color coat clear coat finish, the thickness of the fully cured color coat and clear coat can vary. Generally, the color coat is about 0.4 1.5 mils thick and preferably 0.6 1.0 mils thick and the clear coat is about 0.5 6.0 mils thick and preferably 0.8 1.5 mils thick. The color coat contains pigment in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 1 100 to about 150 100. Any of the conventional pigments used in coating compositions including metallic flake pigments can be used. The clear coat can also contain transparent pigments, i.e., pigments having the same or similar refractive index as the binder of the clear coat and are of a small particle size of about 0.01550 microns. Typical pigments that can be used in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 1 100 to 10 100 are inorganic siliceous pigments, such as silica pigments. These pigments have a refractive index of about 1.4 1.6. The clear coat color coat finish can be applied to all types of substrates such as.primed or unprimed metal, plastic, rubber, flexible ethylenepropylene copolymer rubbers, flexible polyurethanes, fiberglass reinforced with polyester resins and the like by conventional spraying techniques and preferably the clear coat is applied to the color coat while the color coat is still wet. Other conventional application techniques as mentioned above can also be used. Under some circumstances it may be desirable to apply the clear coat as a powder to a wet color coat and then to form a finish by baking. Two particularly useful additives for both the color coat and the clear coat are iron pyrophosphate and finely divided silica. Up to about 10 by weight and generally about 0.1 10 by weight based on the weight of the binder, of iron pyrophosphate can be used. Up to about 15 by weight, and generally about 0.5 15 by weight, based on the weight of the binder, of finely divided silica can be used. Iron pyrophosphate and the silica improve the overall durability and performance of the finish of this invention. In particular, iron pyrophosphate sss a useful additive which provides a synergistic effect with the ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant. Compositions containing the above three constituents have a surprisingly longer period of outdoor weatherability before failure occurs. The longer period is more than the cumulative effect that would be expected of the combination of the three constituents. The following examples illustrate the invention. All parts and percentages are on a weight basis unless other wise specified.

Above Paint A which was reduced to a spraying viscosity and Paint B are each sprayed onto three separate sets of four phosphatized steel panels per set and allowed to air dry for 15 minutes and then baked for 10 minutes at 65 C. to form a coating about 1.1 mils thick. The above clear coat is then applied to each of the above painted panels and air dried for 15 minutes, baked for 10 minutes at 650C to form a clear coat about 0.8 1.0 mils thick. A set of the above panels of Paint A and a set of the above panels of Paint B are exposed to 6 months weathering in Florida. Another set of the above panels of Paint A and another set of the panels of Paint B are exposed to 767 hours of acceleraed weathering in a weathering device AWC and a third pair of sets of the above panels of Paints A and B are exposed to a Q.U.V. Weather O Meter for 631 hours.The percent gloss retention measured at 200 was determined for each of the panels and then averaged after exposure.
