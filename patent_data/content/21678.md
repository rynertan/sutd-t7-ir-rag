Such amino protecting groups include those groups which will be mentioned hereinafter as aminoprotecting groups . The carboxyl protecting groups include any and all groups, such as ester and silyl residues, which are usually employed for the protection of carboxyl in the field of lactam chemistry and in organic chemistry in general, such as ester and silyl residues.Thus, for example, the ester and silyl residues may be methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert butyl, tert amyl, benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, p methoxybenzyl, benzhydryl, phenacyl, phenyl, p nitrophenyl, methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, benzyloxymethyl, acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, p methylsulphonylethyl, methylthiomethyl, trityl, P ,P ,P trichloroethyl, P iodoethyl, trimethylsilyl, dimethylsilyl, acetylmethyl, p nitrobenzoylmethyl, p mesylbenzoylmethyl, phthalimidomethyl, propionyloxymethyl, l,l dimethylpropyl, 3 methyl 3 butenyl, succinimidomethyl, 3,5 di tert butyl 4hydroxybenzyl, mesylmethyl, benzenesulphonylmethyl, phenylthiomethyl, dimethylaminoethyl, pyridine l oxide 2 methyl, methylsulphinylmethyl, bis pmethoxyphenyl methyl, 2 cyano l, 1 dimethylethyl, etc. This invention provides new monocyclic compounds and the selection of such protective groups is only marginal to the gist of this invention.

The compound vY used as a starting material can be easily prepared, for example by the method described in Journal of the American Chemical Society 95, 2401 1973 or a method analogous thereto. In the first stage, compound V is reacted with a disulphidizing agent. The term disulphidizing agent is used herein to include all the reactants that are capable of disulphidizing the sulphur in the l position of compound V and, in particular, thiol compounds of the formula R5 SH and disulphides of the formula R5 S S R5 R5 has the same meaning as defined hereinbefore . This reaction is carried out in the absence of a solvent or in an appropriate solvent. The solvent includes, for example, dioxane, N,N dimethylacetamide,N,N dimethylformamide, benzene, toluene, tert butanol, isopropanol, methyl ethyl ketone, etc., mixtures of such solvents, and other solvents which will not interfere with the reaction. While the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, it is normally advantageous to carry out the reaction at a temperature between 700C and 1500C, When a disulphide compound of R5 S S R5 is employed as the disulphidizing agent, the reaction is catalytically accelerated by the presence of an acid or a base.This acid includes, for example, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid and other mineral acids, p toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, phenylphosphonic acid, acetic acid , formic acid and other organic acids, and Lewis acids such as ferric chloride, zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, etc. When such an acid is employed, there is predominantly obtained a l a isopropenyl azetidine VI which contains a double bond in the exo position. The base mentioned above includes, for example, pyridine, quinoline, N,N dimethyl aniline, triethylamine, etc. In this case, depending on the reaction solvent, time, temperature etc., there is obtained a l isopropylidene azetidine VII having a double bond in the endo position in addition to the l a isopropenyl azetidine VI .This 1 isopropyliden azetidine VII can also be easily obtained by treating l a isopropenyl azetidine VI with a base. The reaction according to this procedure is preferably carried out in streams of an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or the like. The useful molar ratio of disulphidizing agent to starting compound V depends on the S nucleophilicity of the disulphidizing agent used but, generally speaking, about 1 to about 10 equivalents of the agent are employed. After completion of the reaction, the product compound VI can be isolated in optional purity by purification procedures known per se, e.g.extraction with solvents, recrystallization, chronatography, etc. The compound VI , on treatment with a base, yields the compound VII . The base used for this purpose may be the above mentioned base which can be used as a catalyst in the reaction between compound VI and disulphidizing agent. In carrying out this reaction, the base need not be employed in a large amount. Thus, relative to compound VI , about 0.01 to about 0.2 mol equivalent is sufficient. The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, tert butanol, methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, N,N dimethyl acetamide,N,N dimethylformamide, etc., or a mixture of such solvents. Any other solvent that will not interfere with the reaction may also be employed. While the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, the reaction proceeds at room temperature in many instances. The product derivative viz in which R5 is a group of the formula EMI29.1 is a compound which is obtained simultaneously or partially in this reaction step and can be converted to compound VIII by treatment with a reducing agent. The compound VII is then subjected to a reductive desulphurization reaction. The reductive desulphurizing agent used for this purpose may, for example, be Raney nickel, Raney cobalt or the like.This reaction is usually carried out in a solvent. The solvent includes, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, water, etc., although other common organic solvents which do not interfere with the reaction may also be employed. This reaction proceeds readily under mild conditions, e.g. at room temperature to about 800C. The compound VIII is then oxidized in order to remove the N side chain. This oxidation reaction includes an oxidization reaction with an oxidizing agent and a subsequent solvolysis with a solvent or a basic or acidic catalyst. The oxidizing agent used in the above oxidation reaction includes, for example, ozone, alkali metal permanganate e.g. potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, etc. , alkaline earth metal permanganate e.g. barium permanganate, etc. , osmium tetraoxide, lead tetraacetate, etc. This oxidation reaction is usually carried out in a solvent. This solvent includes, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane,N, N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, benzene, acetone, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, proanol, butanol, water, chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, etc. It may be a mixture of such solvents. The proportion of the oxidizing agent relative to compound VIII may be about 1.0 to 4.0 molar equivalents, preferably about 1.0 to 1.2 molar equivalents, although excess ozone if it is used may be employed.While the reaction temperature is not particularly critical, the reaction usually proceeds under cooling or at room temperature. The reaction normally goes to completion with a short time. When a permanganate, for instance, is employed as the oxidizing agent, it is preferable to employ a buffer solution such as phosphate buffer and carry out the reaction in the neutral pH region so as to minimize the decomposition of the starting compound VI or and product compound I . When ozone is used as the oxidizing agent, the conversion of compound VIII to compound IX can be effected by ozonolysis e.g. by carrying out the reaction in a solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, followed by removing the excess ozone and decomposing the ozonide of compound VIII with dimethyl sulphide. The conversion of compound IX to compound II is effected by subjecting compound IX to solvolysis.This reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent and may be optionally conducted with the aid of a basic or acidic catalyst. The base used in such a procedure includes, for instance, inorganic bases such as the hydroxides, carbonates, etc., of alkali metals such as lithium, potassium, sodium, etc., or alkaline earth metals such as calcium, magnesium, etc. organic bases such as metal alkoxides, organic amines, quaternary ammonium salts, etc. basic ion exchange resins and so forth. The acid used in a similar manner includes inorganic acids and their salts such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, zinc chloride, zinc sulphate, ferric chloride, ferric sulphate, etc., organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, etc., silica gel, acidic ion exchange resins and so forth.The solvent used for this reaction includes, for example, water, methanol, ethanol, propanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, etc., as well as mixtures thereof. Any other solvent that will not interfere with the reaction may also be employed likewise. This reaction usually proceeds easily under mild conditions, e.g. under cooling to a slightly elevated temperature. The reaction product in each step can be separated in optional purity by a purification procedure known per se, e.g. extraction with solvents, recrystallization, chromatography, etc.Procedure 2 This procedure relates to a fundamental route of synthesis for the production of optically inactive azetidine derivative in . The starting compound x can be easily prepared by the method described in Molecular Modification inDrug Design 45, 15 1964 or a method analogous thereto. The methoxylation reaction of compound X to compound VIII is carried out by reacting an alkali metal salt of methanol, which is of the formula MOCHa wherein M is an alkali metal , and a halogenating agent with the compound X in the presence of methanol. As examples of the alkali metal salt of methanol, there may be mentioned lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, etc. The halogenating agent is a halogen compound capable of acting as a positive halogen donor, e.g. halogen chlorine, bromine, etc. , N haloimides Nchlorosuccinimide, N bromosuccinimide, etc. , N ha lo sulphonamide s N chlorobenzenesulphonamide, Nchloro p toluenesulphonamide, etc. , 1halobenzotriazoles, organic hypochlorite, etc. . This reaction is carried out in a solvent.Examples of the solvent include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dichloromethane, chloroform , acetonitrile, methanol,N, N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, etc. as well as various mixtures thereof. Any other solvent that will not interfere with the contemplated reaction may likewise be employed. To carry out the reaction, the starting compound X is dissolved or suspended in the above mentioned solvent and, then, the alkali metal salt of methanol, methanol and halogenating agent are added. The desirable proportions of these agents, relative to each mol of starting compound X , are not less than 1 mol of methanol, about 1 to 3.5 mols of the alkali metal salt of methanol and about 1 to 2 mols of halogenating agent. The reaction proceeds readily under cooling or at room temperature to about 30 0C. The reaction can be quenched by making the reaction system acidic. A suitable acid to quench the reaction may, for example, be formic acid, acetic acid or trichloroacetic acid. After the reaction has.thus been quenched, any excess halogenating agent can be removed by treatment with a reducing agent such as sodium thiosulphate or a trialkyl phosphite, for instance. After completion of the above reaction, the product compound VIII can be isolated in an optional purity by conventional separation purification procedures, for example, by extraction with a solvent, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The compound VIII is then subjected to procedures similar to the oxidation procedures described hereinbefore in connection with the conversion of compound VIII to compound lit , whereby an optically inactive form of compound lit is obtained.Procedure 3 In this procedure, the compound X obtained, for example, by the method described in MolecularModification in Drug Design 45, 15 1964 or a method analogous thereto is oxidized to compound II . This oxidation reaction can be effected by procedures similar to those used in the conversion of compound VIII to compound II according to the above procedure 1 . The sulphonation reaction according to this invention is a reaction by which a sulpho group is introduced into the substrate compound. Thus, for example, it can be carried out by reacting the compound II with sulphur trioxide or a reactive derivative of sulphur trioxide. The above mentioned reactive derivative of sulphur trioxide includes, for example, sulphur trioxide pyridine, sulphur trioxide diosane, sulphur trioxide trimethylamine, sulphur trioxide chloro sulpilonic acid and other addition compounds of sulphur trioxide, To conduct this reaction, about 1 to 5 mols, preferably about 1 to 2 mols, of sulphur trioxide or the reactive sulphur trioxide derivative is added to one mol of compound II . The reaction temperature is about Oo to 800C and preferably about 100 to 4000. The above reaction may be carried out in a solvent.The solvent includes, for example, water, ethers e.g. dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, etc. , esters e.g. ethyl acetate, ethyl formate, etc. , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. chloroform, dichloromethane, etc. , hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, n hexane, etc. , amides e.g. dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, etc. and other common organic solvents. These solvents may be used alone or in combination. After completion of the reaction, the compound I can be isolated in an optional purity by conventional separation purification procedures, for example, by extraction with a solvent, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The compound I wherein R1 is amino, i.e.compound IV , is useful as an intermediate for the production of a useful medicine. The compound I wherein R1 is acylated amino, i.e. compound III , can be produced by acylating the compound IV The compound III is represented by the formula EMI35.1 wherein R3 is an acylated amino group and x is hydrogen or methoxy. The acylation according to this invention is accomplished by reacting the compound IV with an acylating agent containing the acyl group corresponding to the one contained in the acylated amino group which is represented by R1, R2 or R3. The acylating agent used in this reaction may, for example, be an organic carboxylic acid containing such an acyl group R3 or a reactive derivative of such acid. The reactive derivative of the organic acid includes, for example, the acid anhydride, activated amide, activated ester or the like. More specifically, the following reactive derivatives of organic acids may be mentioned.1 Acid anhydrides The acid anhydrides include, for example, hydrogen halides e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, etc. mixed acid anhydrides, monoalkyl carbonic acid mixed acid anhydrides, aliphatic carboxylic acid mixed acid anhydrides mixed acid anhydrides with e.g acetic acid, pivalic acid, valeric acid, isopentanoic acid, trichloroacetic acid, etc. , aromatic carboxylic acid mixed acid anhydrides mixed acid anhydrides with e.g. benzoic acid, etc. , symmetric acid anhydrides, etc.2 Activated amides The activated amides include, for example, the amides with pyrazole, imidazole, 4 substitutedimidazole, dimethylpyrazole, benzotriazole, etc.3 Activated esters The activated esters include, for example, methyl ester, ethyl ester, methoxymethyl ester, propargyl ester, 4 nitrophenyl ester, 2,4dinitrophenyl ester, trichlorophenyl ester, pentachlorophenyl ester, mesylphenyl ester, ester of said carboxylic or other acids with l hydroxy lR 2 pyridone, N hydroxysuccinimide, N hydroxyphthalimide, etc. The reactive derivative of the organic acid is selected according to the type of acid chosen and, when a free acid is used as the acylating agent, the reaction is desirably carried out in the presence of a condensing agent. The condensing agent includes, for example, N,Nt dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, N cyclohexyl N morpholinoethylcarbodiimide, N cyclohegyl N 4 diethylaminocyclohesyl carbodiimide, N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, etc. This acylation reaction is generally carried out in a solvent. The solvent includes, for example, water, acetone, dioxane, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, pyridine, etc., as well as the common organic solvents which do not interfere with the reaction. These solvents, if they are hydrophilic, may be used in a mixture with water. Furthermore, the acylation reaction can be conducted in the presence of a base, for example, alkali metal carbonates, trialkylamines e.g. trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylaznine, N methylmorpholine, N methylpiperidine, etc. , N,Ndialkylaniline, N,N dialkylbenzylamine, pyridine, picoline, lutidine, 1,5 diazabicyclo 4, 3, O non 5 ene, 1,4 diazabicyclo 2, 2, 2 octane, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5, 4, 4 undecene 7, etc. The base, as well as the condensing agent, may be used as the solvent as well, only if it is liquid. The reaction temperature is not particularly critical and, in many cases, the reaction is carried out under cooling to room temperature. Referring to the acylation reaction, when the reactive derivative of the starting compound IV with respect to its amino group or a salt thereof and the acylating agent respectively contain an asymmetric carbon atom, the corresponding stereoisomers can be employed respectively or as a ixture. Moreover, when the reaction yields such isomers in admixture, they may be fractionally isolated by procedures known per se, for example, by column chromatography, recrystallization, etc. The compound I which has a protective group is useful as an intermediate for the production of a useful medicine. For example, the compound I which does not have a protective group can be obtained by the removal of the protective group. The removal of the protective group from the azetidine derivative I can be effected by a choice of the hitherto known procedures, the choice depending on the type of protective group. Thus, for example, the method may comprise the use of an acid, a base or hydrazine, or may be a reductive method or a method comprising permitting an iminohalogenating agent to act on the substrate compound and, then, an iminoetherifying agent to act thereon and, finally and if necessary, hydrolyzing the same. In the method employing an acid, while the choice depends on the type of protective group and other conditions, the acid may, for example, be an inorganic acid e.g.hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. , an organic acid e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, etc. or an acidic ion exchange resin. In the method involving the use of a base, while the choice depends on the type of protective group and other conditions, the base may, for example, be an inorganic base such as the hydroxide or carbonate of an alkali metal e.g.sodium, potassium, e tc. or alkaline earth metal e.g.calcium, magnesium, etc. , an alkali metal alkoxide, an organic base e.g. organic amines, quaternary ammonium salts, etc. or a basic ion exchange resin. When, in the above methods involving the use of a base or an acid, a solvent is employed, it is generally desirable, in many cases, to use a hydrophilic organic solvent, water or a mixture thereof. The reductive method, while the choice depends on the type of protective group and other conditions, may be a method employing a metal e.g. tin, zinc, etc. or a metal compound e.g. chromous dichloride, chromous acetate, etc. and an organic, inorganic or other acid e.g. acetic acid, propionic acid, hydrochloric acid, etc. , or a method involving the presence of a metal catalyst for catalytic reduction.As examples of the catalyst used for such catalytic reduction, there may be mentioned platinum catalysts such as platinum wire, platinum sponge, platinum black, platinum oxide, colloidal platinum, etc., palladium catalysts such as palladium sponge, palladium black, palladium oxide, palladium barium sulphate, palladium barium carbonate, palladium carbon, palladium silica gel, colloidal palladium, etc., and nickel catalysts such as reduced nickel, nickel oxide, Raney nickel, Urushibara nickel, etc. In the reductive method employing a metal and an acid, the combination of a metal compound, e.g. a compound of iron, chromium or the like, with an inorganic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid or the like, may be employed. The reductive procedure is normally carried out in a solvent. In the case of catalytic reduction, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, etc., and ethyl acetate, etc., are commonly employed. In the procedure involving the use of a metal and an acid, the solvent is usually water, acetone or the like, but when the acid is liquid, it may be utilized as the solvent as well. The reaction is usually carried out under cooling to under warming, preferably in a temperature range of about OOC to about 300C. Referring to the procedure comprising the use of an iminohalogenating agent and, then, an iminoetherifying agent, followed by hydrolysis to remove the protective group, the iminohalogenating agent may, for example, be phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus tribromide, phosphorus pentabromide, phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride or phosgene. The reaction temperature is not critical and, in many cases, the reaction is carried out under room temperature to under cooling. The iminoetherifying agent which is then permitted to act on the resulting reaction product may, for example, be an alcohol or a metal alkoxide.Thus, the alcohol includes, for example, alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, n butanol, tert butanol, etc. and compounds wherein the alkyl moieties of such alkanols as mentioned above have been substituted by alkoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, etc. The metal alkoxide includes, for example, alkali metal alkoxides sodium alkoxides, potassium alkoxides, etc. and alkaline earth metal alkoxides calcium alkoxides, barium alkoxides, etc. as may be derived from the above mentioned and other alcohols. When, for example, the protective group is an organic carboxylic acid residue and the carbon atom adjacent to its carbonyl group carries a certain substituent such as a free amino, hydroxyl, mercapto, carboxyl or sulpho group, it is advantageous first to carry out a treatment for enhancing the adjacent group effect of such group so as to increase the reactivity of the carbonyl group before carrying out the removal of the protective group. In this connection, the case in which the substituent group on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is a free amino group will be described by way of illustration. Thus, the free amino group may be converted to a thioureido group and, then, the necessary deacylation reaction is carried out. This and other procedures known in the art of cleavage of peptide bonds can be utilized to remove the protective group. The temperature for this reaction is not especially critical but may be suitably selected according to the type of protective group and the method then applied for removing the protective group.It is preferable, after all, that the reaction to be carried out under cooling to a slightly elevated temperature. There are cases in which the derivative in the carboxyl function of the compound wherein R1 is a group containing such a carboxyl group is transformed into a carboxyl group in the course of this reaction and such cases are also included in the concept and ambit of this invention. The compound I thus obtained by removal of the protective group can be converted, if desired, to a desired salt thereof in a conventional manner. The compound I , which contains a sulpho group, is generally capable of forming a salt with a base. Therefore, the compound I may then be isolated as a salt which, in turn, may be converted to the free form or to a different salt. The free compound I may, of course, be converted to a salt. The base mentioned above may be an inorganic base, e.g. lithium, potassium, sodium, calcium, ammonium, etc., or an organic base, e.g. pyridine, collidine, triethylamine, triethanolamine, etc. The salt form of compound I is also included in the scope of this invention. To convert the salt form of compound I to the free compound I , a method using an acid, for example, can be employed. The type of acid varies with different protective groups and other conditions.However, such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc., and such organic acids as formic acid, acetic acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, etc., are generally employed.Apart from the types of acids mentioned above, acidic ion exchange resins are also useful. The solvent may, for example, be acetone, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, dioxane or the like, water, or a mixture of water and such a solvent. The compound IV , as the starting compound for the acylation reaction, may be used in the form of a salt. The salt may be any of the salts mentioned in connection with salts of compound I . The acylation reaction, where the starting material is a salt as mentioned above, may give rise to a salt of compound III . In such cases, the salt of compound III can be converted to a different salt and isolated as such, just as mentioned for compound I . Such salts may be converted to free compound III and isolated as such. This conversion oi a salt to the free compound III can be effected in the same manner as described hereinbefore in connection. with compound I . The compound I may exist as diastereoisomers or optical isomers. In such cases, the respective isomers and their mixtures are also included in the scope of this invention. These isomers, separately or as mixtures, can be used as medicines. When such mixtures of isomers are recovered as products, each mixture may be resolved into the component isomers by a conventional optical resolution method or other purification methods, e.g. extraction with solvent, recrystallization, chromatography, etc. The compound I thus obtained is useful as a drug, being active against certain gram positive and gram negative bacteria. By way of example, the compounds are active against. the following microorganisms.
