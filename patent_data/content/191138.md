## Description
The present invention relates to an epoxy resin composition for cast insulators to be used for electrical equipments. Cured products of epoxy resins and acid anhydrides have excellent electrical characteristics and mechanical and chemical properties, and thus they are widely used as epoxy resin cast insulators for electrical equipments or power transmission and distribution equipments. For the production of such epoxy resin cast articles, there is a so called pressure gelation method as a method for shortening the mold release time in order to improve the productivity by means of a small number of casting molds. According to this method, a mixture of the resin composition is maintained in a low temperature pressure tank, and at the time of casting, it is injected, through a pipeline and a casting head directly into mold having a temperature higher than the resin mixture, while maintaining the pressure to complement the cure shrinkage of the resin, whereby the curing will be completed in a short period of time to obtain a final product. The epoxy resin mixture to be used in this method, is required to have a low viscosity in the low temperature pressure tank, a long useful life, and a property so that it can quickly be cured in the high temperature mold. As a general characteristic of epoxy resins, those having a low viscosity at a low temperature have a low molecular weight and thus have an extremely large cure shrinkage factor, whereby the cured product is likely to have defects such as sink marks or cracks. On the other hand, those having a high reaction rate at a high temperature are usually reactive also at a low temperature, whereby the useful life tends to be short. With respect to these problems, it is common to employ a pressure gelation method to avoid the sink marks or cracks which are likely to form during the curing process, or to employ a latent accelerator to prolong the useful life. However, an epoxy resin having a low molecular weight and a low viscosity at a low temperature, is usually inferior in the thermal shock resistance to a solid or highly viscous epoxy resin which is commonly employed in an ordinary casting method other than the pressure gelation method. Heretofore, as a method for improving the thermal shock resistance of an epoxy resin having a low viscosity, it has been proposed to incorporate a flexibilizer such as a high molecular weight oligomer having a molecular weight of from 500 to 5000 with its main chain made of a polyester, a polyether, a polybutadiene or the like JP A 26199 1972 JP A 30439 1972 JP A 47319 1972 . However, such a method has a drawback such that with an increase of the amount of the flexibilizer, the viscosity increases remarkably, and the heat resistance decreases substantially. On the other hand, if the amount is small, no substantial improvement of the thermal shock resistance is obtainable. A flexibilizer which does not substantially increase the viscosity of the resin mixture, such as the one with its main chain made of a polyamide, has a drawback such that it has a high reactivity, whereby the useful life of the resin mixture tends to be short. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the conventional drawback that either the heat resistance or the thermal shock resistance of the low viscosity epoxy resin is sacrificed, and to provide an epoxy resin composition having excellent thermal shock resistance without impairing the heat resistance and the properties essential for the pressure gelation method i.e. a low viscosity at a low temperature, a long useful life and a quick curing property at a high temperature. The present invention provides an epoxy resin composition which comprises Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. In the accompanying drawing, Figure 1 is a graph showing the changes with time of the viscosities at 60 C of the epoxy resin compositions prepared by Examples 1 to 4 and by Comparative Examples 1 to 3. As the epoxy resin a having an epoxy equivalent of at most 200 to be used in the present invention, there may be employed any epoxy resin which is liquid at a low temperature i.e. from 20 to 80 C or which, when mixed with a curing agent i.e. the condensation mixture b , is liquid at a low temperature. For example, the following epoxy resins may be employed alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more different kinds. Namely, there may be mentioned a bisphenol A type epoxy resin, a bisphenol F type epoxy resin, a phenol novolak type epoxy resin, a cresol novolak type epoxy resin, an cycloaliphatic diglycidyl ester type epoxy resin, a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin containing an epoxy group in the ring, an epoxy resin containing a spiro ring, and a hydantoin epoxy resin. The condensation mixture b to be used in the present invention, is prepared by mixing the polybasic carboxylic acid anhydride, the bisphenol A of the formula I and the monohydric phenol of the formula II at a temperature of from 100 to 150 C in a nitrogen atmosphere until a uniform liquid is obtained. In this preparation, an accelerator such as a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid or a tertiary amine, may be optionally added. As the polybasic carboxylic acid anhydride to be used for the preparation of the condensation mixture b , there may be employed any polybasic carboxylic acid anhydride so long as it is liquid at a low temperature i.e. from 20 to 80 C . For example, there may be mentioned hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride and methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride. These anhydrides may be used alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more different kinds. As the monohydric phenol, there may be mentioned, for example, cresol and tert butylphenol. These phenols may be used alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more different kinds. In the condensation mixture b , if the amount of the bisphenol A of the formula I is less than 0.07 mol relative to 1 mol of the polybasic carboxylic acid anhydride, and if the amount of the monohydric phenol of the formula II is less than 0.07 mol, it becomes difficult to improve the thermal shock resistance of the cured product. On the other hand, if the amount of the bisphenol A exceeds 0.3 mol, and if the amount of the monohydric phenol exceeds 0.3 mol, the viscosity of the mixture of the epoxy resin and the inorganic powder filler at a low temperature exceeds 100,000 cp centipoise , whereby the injection through the pipeline will be difficult, and the resin mixture can not be used as a resin mixture for the pressure gelation casting method. As the inorganic powder c to be used as the filler in the present invention, there may be employed any inorganic powder so long as it does not impair the electrical and mechanical properties. For example, there may be mentioned alumina powder, hydrated alumina powder, quartz powder or fused quartz powder. However, the inorganic powder is not restricted to these specific examples. The epoxy resin composition of the present invention preferably comprises 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin a , from 50 to 150 parts by weight of the condensation mixture b and from 200 to 600 parts by weight of the inorganic powder c . The process for producing a cast product from the epoxy resin composition of the present invention may comprise mixing the epoxy resin a having an epoxy equivalent of at most 200 with the condensation mixture b and the inorganic powder c optionally together with an accelerator, at a temperature of from 20 to 80 C, preferably under a vacuumed condition, and injecting the epoxy resin composition thereby obtained, through a pipeline, directly into a mold preheated at a temperture of from 90 to 160 C, followed by curing for from 1 to 30 minutes while maintaining the pressure at a gauge pressure level of from 0.5 to 5.0 kg cmÂ², whereby a cured product will be obtained. As the accelerator which may be added to the epoxy resin composition, there may be employed a metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid such as zinc octylate, a tertiary amine, a boron trifluoride amine complex or an imidazole. However, the accelerator is not restricted to these specific examples. The amount of the accelerator is adjusted so that the curing can be completed in from 1 to 30 minutes at a mold temperature of from 90 to 160 C, and the accelerator is incorporated preferably in an amount of from 0.8 to 8 parts by weight. Further, other additives such as a coloring agent, a coupling agent and an internal release agent may be incorporated to the epoxy resin composition of the present invention so long as they do not impair the viscosity, the long useful life and the quick curing property of the resin composition and the desired properties of the cured product such as the high HDT heat deformation temperature and the high thermal shock resistance. Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples and Comparative Examples.
