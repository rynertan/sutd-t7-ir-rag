## Description
SIPTION This invention relates generally to hazardous environmental suits used to protect workers in contaminated areas, and particularly to a throw away type such suit. Goldstein U.S. patent 4,272,851 discloses a protective suit or garment constructed of a non woven, spun bonded olefin manufactured under the trademark Tyvek, a trademark of DuPont de Nemours Company , which is coated on one side by a polyethylene film. The olefin provides tear resistance, and the film prevents chemical penetration. While the patent does not discuss the arrangement of adjacent surfaces of a seam of two pieces of the material, it is believed implicit that film side to film side is employed. First, examining the arrangement in Figure 4, it is noted that each of the two thicknesses are turned 1800 to form facing surfaces, thus indicating that identical surfaces are mated.Second, normally, and as illustrated by Bibby U.S. patent A,190,010, the film, less porous, side of a protective garment waterproof forms the outside of such a garment and, three, Tyvek is not directly heat bondable to another layer of Tyvek, this being indicated by its manufacturer. The Goldstein patent acknowledges the desirability of providing additional seam strength, accomplishing this by the addition of a binding around the external edge region of the seam and securing this region by stitching. The patent asserts that by this technique, since the needle holes are outside of the ultrasonic welded portion, the latter provides an unbroken barrier to the introduction of any contamlnant, it beiny pLesumed that this means t t even if a contaminant would pass through the stitching holes that it could not reach the interior because of the welded portion. There are, however, two problems with the structure of Goldstein. First, while it is true that there is a seal between the two turned back layers of material which is inboard of the stitching, there are two unsealed paths on the outside of these sealed layers which extend from the inside of the garment to the stitches. This, of course, can provide a leakage path. Second, even if one can affect a seal of all three surfaces of the material at a weld or welded seam, by the vary mechanical arrangement of the seam, it is particularly vulnerable to stretching forces which can and are frequently applied by natural movements of the wearer of the garment.The stresses are very concentrated, being first on the inside edge of a weld In view of the small area to which the forces are initially directed, they can readily be hundreds of pounds per square inch just by the manipulation of oness arms, assuming a sleeve member is involved. As will U noted, initially, the sewn seam is not involved, and thus it provides no reinforcing pressure to hold the material together, with the result that with continued stretching forces, the weld is broken back to the point of sewing where sufficient resistance will probably be met to stop the tearing away process. Unfortunately, however, at this point, the seal of the weld no longer exists, and the remaining barrier, a sewn seam, is not liquid proof. Accordingly, it is the object of this invention to provide a significantly stronger seam and yet one which does not require sewing. According to one aspect of the present invention we provide a protective garment comprising a material formed of bonded layers including as a . at and inner lay spun bu.lued oleilii a, as a second and outer layer a bondable film from the group of films wherein one film includes polyethylene and the other film includes polyvinylidine chloride an inner surface, surface A, of said material being a surface of said spun bonded olefin and the outer surface, surface B, of said material being a surface of said bondable film first and second tubular sleeves, each formed of an elongated portion of said material and wherein each sleeve is configured by overlapping side edge regions of said elongated portion, a surface A of one side edge region forming a first thickness of material, lying flat against a surface r of the other side edge region forming a second thickness of material and a bonded, sealed, joint between said overlapped side edge regions, bonding being effected by applying ultrasonic energy through said overlapping side edge regions of said first and second thicknesses of material and simultaneously applying a plurality of spaced regions of pressure to said overlapped side edge region, wherein the combination of adjacent conditions of applied heat and pressure, and heat only, is effected. According to another aspect of the invention we provide a method of making protective garments or parts thereof from fabric comprising a first layer laminated on one side thereof to a second layer, the first and second layers being bondable together by the application of ultrasonic waves, said method comprising a. overlapping edges of pieces of said fabric to be bonded together so that a surface of a first layer of one piece of said fabric is in contact with a surface of a second layer of another piece of said fabric in the area of said overlap and b. bonding said pieces of fabric together in the area ot the said overlap uy applying a combination of hig frequency ultrasonic waves and pressure to the overlapped pieces of fabric. Preferably the first layer bonds weakly or is nonbondable to another similar layer by the application of ultrason c loaves, wherein prior to bonding one of said pieces of said fabric is folded around the edge of the other piece of said fabric back past the area of said overlap ifl such runner that a surface of a layer of the folded portion of the fabric is in contact with a surface of a similar of one of the overlapping pieces of said fabric so that the layers are unbonded or only weakly bonded to one another In a preferred embodiment of this invention protective suit is made or a fabric film combination, an ideal fabric being Tyvek a material manufactured and sold tinder Is traciemark by DuPont . The seam is made by bringing the two edges of the material together from opposite airections, and necessarIly with this approach, the materials are arranged filth side to Tyvek side This would not seem an extraordinary approach except for the fact that when one attempts to weld them together in an ordinary technique, such as bv a continuous weld seam as employed by Goldstein but film side to film side , theTyvek appears to effect a migration or change in composition with the result that the welding attempt fails, the material literally coming apart at the point of weld. Perhaps that is the reason that Goldstein stayed with a film to film weld, although not an entirely satisfactory one, as he notes. In any event, the applicant has determined that by the combination of a continuous application of ultrasonic heating and spaced application of pressure that a continuous bond is effected, it being both unnecessary and, in fact, undes raole to provide continuous pressure. It appears tnat the graduations in stresses that inherently occur in between applied areas of pressure create regions of enhanced bonding strength, and at the same time the bonding effected is sufficiently continuous as to prevent leakage. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is an elevational view of a protective suit as contemplated by this invention Figure 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view taken along line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an enlarged partial view of Figure 2 Figure 4 is an enlarged partial view of a portion of a sleeve as illustrated in Figure 2 but with an added fold of the material Figure 5 is a generaily diagrammatic illustration of an ultrasonic type weldi g apparatus as employed in the welding of seams position d as shown in Figures 2 4 Figure 5a is an enlarged partial view of a portion ofFigure 5 Figure 6 is an enlarged partial view of the sleeve processed by the welder s shown in Figure 5 and after a folded portion has been p.lled away Figure 7 is a cross sectional iew showing a modification of a structure of Figure 3 in which a strip has been added and Figure 8 is a cross sectional view showing a modification of Figure 4 in which a strip has been added. Referring to Figure 1, the present invention generally contemplates the construction of a protective garment or suit 10 having a sealable, zipper locked opening not shown generally covered by a protective flap 12. Suit 10 is constructed of a laminated material having as an inner layer a fabric type material, such as Tyvek, and as an outer layer a chemical resistant film, such as a polyethylene or Saranex, a film manufactured and sold nner this trademark by Dow Chem a3 Company .Significantly, in the construction of such a suit, various seams must be sewn, notably in leg units 14 and 16 and arm units 18 and 20. Obviously, a seam contemplates a break of some character in the continuity of material and where, as in the case c a protective garment, there must be no loss in the protective cower, or insignificantly so, the seam must be near perfectly made Figure 2 illustrates generally the tubular construction of an arm 20 of suit 10 and particularly Illustrates the creation of a seam in accordance with this invention It contemplates an overlapping region 22 of a first region or thickness 2 of material with a second region or thickness 26 of the same material, an enlarged view of which is illustrated in Figure 3. As stated, the material of suit 10 is formed of an inner layer of Tyv x 28 to which there has been bonded an outer layer of film 30, this film being one whicn is, of course, bondaole to the Tyvek and is generally iapervious to such hazardous nemicals as a suit wearer might expect to encounter As stated above, one such film is polyethylene and another isSaranex, a composite film including an inner layer of polyvinylidine chloride.Regardless of the bondable film employed, it will be on the outside As is to be noted in the drawings, a Tyvek surface A of edge region 24 is positioned over a mating surface D of film of edge region 26. There are now overlapped areas of film material to Tyvek. The next step in the process is to selectively apply a heat and pressure influence to the overlapped material1 the former being accomplished by ultrasonic radiation.Unfortunately, if one attempts to make a seam closing of a tubular configuration as best illustrated in Figure 2, at present there is no shown ultrasonic welding machine that is configured to effect such welding. A general illustration of conventional ultrasonic welder 32 is shown in Figure 5, and it is to be noted that its elements form a closed configuration except for a single opening 34 through which material may be fed. Thus, it is to be seen that a closed circle would not fit around elements of the welding machine and that a seam cannot be constructed which would entail doing this. To solve the structural problem, and as a feature of this invention, the material is folded as shown in Figure 4 to create a third thickness 33 of the material across overlapped region 22, and as folded, the material is fed through ultrasonic welder 32 as shown in Figure 5.Ultrasonic welder 32 is conventional and employs an ultrasonic generator 36 which generates a sound vibrational signal of approximately 20 KHz at a power of approximately 350 watts which is transmitted upwards by transducer 38 through rotary table 40 supported by shaft 41 and conventional bearing 42. Radiation then passes up through the material of sleeve 20 to be joined by a seam.To accomplish this, the material is moved through welder 32 coordindate with the rotation of wheel 44, driven by motor 46, typically fed by a feed member not shown. Pressure is applied to an upper surface C of thickness 22 by wheel 44 of welder 32, typically formed of metal, and is approximately two inches in diameter and approximately 0.6 inch wide. It has two spaced sets of four rows of raised regions or lands 48, being approximately 0.02 inch in height, 0.12 inch long, and 0.04 inch wide. The length or circumferential spacing between these lands is approximately 0.03 inch and the lateral spacing between rows of them, sets of rows is being 0.04 inch and between rows of lands ol a set of rows being 0.02 inch.A variable downward force in the approximate range of 20 to 35 pounds is applied by a spring, diagraininatically illustrated as spring 50, providing an effective force via the 1 ends of 900 to l,u00 PSI as needed fo the material used. Two passes of the material are typically made, creating a weld approximately 0.6 inch in width.There is also created an unwanted bond between overlapped or folded thicknesses 26 and 33 in region 22, being a Tyvek to Tyvek connection. rorLun te. this latter join. is a weak one, and by pulling on regions of the sleeve back at, say, points X and Y, this latter joint will give way to a state where portions of sleeves 20 are separated, this being illustrated in Figure 6 showing as region 22a the former position of a bond. Significantly, it is to be seen that if one attempts to stretch the ins be of sleeve 20 as shown in eitherFigures 2, 3, or 6 that th till welded area of the seam 52 resists this force, extending over the overlapping welded region of a oroi .imately 0.6 inch. As a result, the mechanical strength of the seam is tremendous, and it is simply not destroyable by anticipated muscular forces exertable on the inside of the sleeve.This is in contrast to a seam t tne arrangement Illustrated byGoldstein, wherein, as can be seen rom Figure 4, by pulling on members 14 and 16 in opposite directions, one applies essentially all force on an extremely small area of connection, and as it gives, these small areas of stress cause the material to yield and the seam commences giving away. This can occur at levels of force to be anticipated in the ordinary usage of a garment In any event, the focus of the forces are moved along until a seam finally breaks back to the stitched regions. When this occurs, there is the propensity for leakage through the stitches, a proolem long existing where stitched seams have been attempted in protective garments and presently a very real problem where stitches are relied upon for strength of a seam. Again referring to the construction of a seam as contemplate by this invention, while it might have been thought that to apply spaced increments of pressure as accomplished by the lands 48 of pressure wheel 44 would leave unsealed regions in between, it has been found that to the contrary, the configuration appears to effect a cont nuous sealing effect not achieveable with a continuous pressure wheel. In fact, with a continuous application of pressure as it appears was employed byGoldstein to a fil to ilm joint to a Tyvek to flim joint, a breakdown will occur in the structure of the material, this producing voids which actually break through the material.In fact, it may have been such an obstacle that lead to the film to film welding employed byGoldstein Significantly, the mechanical arrangement ofthe Goldstein seam makes it inherently weak and creates the necessity for adding the stitching step. Clearly the seam constructeci in accordance with applicant s invention will provide a more effective seal than employed by the combination of a film to film plus a stitching arrangement. On the other hand, where extreme fluid pressures are to be encountered and further assurances sought as to the integrity of the seam, it is possible to further reinforce one of applicant s seams.Thus, Figure 7 illustrates the application of a strip of thickness 54 of protective material, e.g., bondable film, applied over a seam 50 between end regions or thicknesses 24 and 26, this strip typically being of a film such as Saranex. Figure 8 illustrates a strip 56 positioned on the inside of a seam, and in this case, it typically would be a strip of film coated Tyvek. In the latter case, there would thus be three thicknesses of material. From the foregoing, it is to be well appreciated that the applicant has provided a major step forward in the construction of safe protective garments which provide an increased margin of safety for the wearer which it is believed will play a major role in enhancing capabilities in safely working in hazardous environments as, for example, those created by toxic chemicals.
