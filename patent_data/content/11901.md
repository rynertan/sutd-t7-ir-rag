## Description
DOOR, WINDOW OR FRAME The invention relates to a door, window or frame comprising a plastic enclosure in which a pane or a panel can be set, this enclosure being composed of main sections provided with a rabbet against which the pane or panel can be placed, and a fixation section k , k securing the pane or panel against the rabbet, optionally with intermediate sealing means being used, which fixation section can be r attached to the main section by means of one or more snap interlocks. This type of door, window or frame is known from theNetherlands Patent Application No, 7009258. The fixation section described therein is attached to the main section by means of two snap interlocks. This construction involves the drawback that the fixation section also called glazing bead can easily removed by unauthorized persons. The pane or panel can then be removed noiselessly. Is is the object of the invention to obviate this drawback, and to provide a door, window or frame so constructed as to make it very difficult, if not impossible, to avoid damage in removing the fixation section with a view to taking the pane or panel out of its enclusere. According to the invention this is achieved in that the fixation section is connected to the main section on the side away from the pane or panel in that a bent edge of the fixation section is made to cooperate with a bent edge or groove of the main section by hooking in the fixation section and turning it on an axis parallel to itself, the edges or grooves being so designed that the connection can be disconnected only by turning the fixation section back, and in that the connection on the side near the plane of the pane or panel is a snap interlock securing the fixation section in the position reached after turning. Preferably, the snapping movement of this interlock is towards the plane of the pane or panel, because this ensures better compressions of the sealing means. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the main section has a bent edge and the fixation section has a cooperating bent edge and a straight edge, this bent edge and straight edge gripping around the bent edge of the main section. The fixation section may also be attached to a door or winnow frame to serve as stop for the door or window. The invention also relates to a door or window frame provided with a fixation section serving as stop for the door or window, with the frame being connected to the stop section on the side away from the plane of the door or window in that a bent edge of the stop section is made to cooperate with a bent edge or groove of the frame by hooking in the stop section and turning it on an axis parallel to itself, the edges and sections being so designed that the connection can be disconnected only by turning the stop section back, and with the connection on the side near the plane of the door or window being a snap interlock securing the stop section in the position reached after turning. The invention further relates to the fixation section serving as stop or as glazing bead provided with a bent edge which, by hooking in the fixation section and turning it on an axis parallel to itself, can be made to cooperate with a bent edge or groove of the other section. The bent edge and the fixation section are so designed that the connection can be disconnected only. by turning the fixation section back, The fixation section further has an edge which can establish a snap interlock between this section, in the position reached after turning, and an edge of the other section. The installed fixation section, which may serve as glazing bead or a stop for a door or window, can now removed from the outside only by main force, whereas fastening during installation is very simple. In addition a good tight between pane or panel and fixation section is obtained. A further advantage is that when the pane of panel has got damaged or has broken, the glazing bead can be removed in a simple way after the pane or panel has been taken out, and can be very easily replaced again after a new pane or panel has been installed. Both the main section and the fixation section are preferably made of a thermoplast. This brings the advantages of, e.g., low waintenance requirement, good thermal and acoustic insulation, good shape retention and dimensional stability, and esthetic attractivenes because of the possibility of keeping the sections slender. The invention will now be elucidated with reference to a drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a sectional view of a preferred design of a window frame with a fixation section installed Fig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of this preferred design Fig. 3 is a sectional view of an installed fixation section with the members forming the connection on the side away from the plane of the door or window being of bent design Figs. 4 and 5 show still other possible designs of the connection between frame and fixation section on the side away from the plane of window or door Fig. 6.shows a connection of a fixation section to a door frame, with the fixation section serving as door stop. In the drawing, reference number 1 indicates a window frame or a main section with a pane 2 installed in it. The pane rests on support pads 3. The frame is provided with a rabbet 4 against which the pane 2 rests, with a sealing strip 5 between rabbet and pane. On the other side the pane 2 is secured in place by means of a fixation section 6, which clamps in the pane 2, with a sealing strip 7 between fixation section and pane. As clearly shown by Fig. 2, the fixation section 6 has a bent and a straight edge, 8 and 13, respectively, and the frame section 1 has a bent edge 9.When the fixation section 6 is installed, the bent edge 8 is made to cooperate with the bent edge 9 by hooking in this fixation section and then turning it on an axis parallel to itself the other side of fixation section 6, i.e. the side near the window, has a straight lip 10 which snaps behind the lip 11 of the frame section 1. The snap interlock 10,11 secures the fixation section 6 in place, so that it cannot be turned back in the normal way. Thus a burglarproof connection has been established. The other designs shown in Figs. 3 5 are self explanatory. These figures clearly show that the connection between frame section and fixation section on the side away from the window 2 can be made also in another, but essentially similar way. It is here seen that section 1, instead of having a bent edge 9, may be provided with a groove 14 into which the bent edge 15 of the fixation section can grip.Figs. 4 and 5 show embodiments of this principle. Fig. 6 shows that the fixation section 6 can be used also as stop for a door 12. The connection between the sections 1 and 6 is made in the same way as shown in Fig. 1. Otherwise the figure is self explanatory,
