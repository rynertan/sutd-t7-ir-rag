# KNIT FABRIC BEARING

## Abstract
This invention provides a fabric bearing wherein the fab ric is a plated jersey knit fabric having a low friction fibre or yarn, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, exposed on the face of the fabric and a structural fibre or yarn, such as a polyester, exposed on the back of the fabric. To form a bearing for a rotating shaft the plated jersey knit fabric is preferably formed by circular knitting with the low friction fibre or yarn on the inside of the tubular fabric bearing and the structural fibre or yarn on the outside of the fabric bearing adapted for bonding to a rubber, plastic or metal support means by thermosetting or thermoplastic resin or by molding a rubber or plastic sup port means around the fabric bearing. To form a bearing for a sliding element the plated jersey knit fabric is preferably formed by circular knitting with the low friction fibre or yarn on the outside of the tubular fabric, the structural fibre or yarn on the inside of the fabric, then turning the tubular fabric inside out, preferably as it is knitted, to place the low friction face of the fabric on the inside of the tube.
