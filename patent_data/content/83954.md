## Description
A heat exchanger, a method for manufacturing the same, and a gas drier provided with such a heat exchanger. Closed heat exchangers are known in many forms. They all comprise a heat conducting partition wall between two flow spaces, through one of which a heat releasing substance can flow, and through the other one a heat accepting substance is led. By heat conduction, heat can pass from one to the other substance. In order to obtain an efficient heat transfer, it should be ensured that heat can pass from any portion of the first flow towards any portion of the other one. This requires that the partition wall should be allowed to contact all portions of both flows. In order to obtain this the flows can, for instance, be made turbulent in such a manner that, by mixing, the heat transfer is accelerated, and all portions of the liquid will alternately contact the partition wall, but this will generally require a relatively long flow path through the heat exchanger. On the other hand, the heat contact with the partition wall can be improved by increasing the surface area of this wall, in particular by fixing thereon vanes or fins or the like of a good heat conducting material. An additional advantage thereof is that, by wall friction, local turbulences are created in the flow which enhance the heat transfer. It has been known for a long time, i.a. from US 877252 1908 , that, for the latter purpose, wire loops of a metal with a high heat conductivity such as copper are suitable, which loops are soldered on a metal partition wall, in particular a copper tube, and are, more particularly, bent from a continuous wire to form a loop hose which is helically wound around the tube and is soldered thereto. The advantage thereof is that the loops can be formed in a continuous operation. Such loops have a much better shape stability than protruding pins of a comparable thickness. A further advantage is that the liquid can flow along such loops at all sides, so that a large heat transfer surface area is provided without substantially increasing the flow velocity. A device for providing such wire loops is described in NL C 145 783. Such heat exchangers are generally used for central heating purposes, and then hot water is flowing through the tube and the wire loops are contacting the ambient air, said heat exchanger then being generally mounted within a casing connecting with the space to be heated, and within said casing an air flow brushing along said wire loops is created by heating the air. From NL C 155 164 such a heat exchanger designed for air heating is known, and therein the tube only serves as a carrier for the wire loops, an electric heating wire being arranged between said loops. In such a water air heat exchanger, in fact, only the heat transfer towards the air is a determining factor for the operation, since the dimensions of such heat exchangers are, generally, so that the heat transfer from the water flowing through the tube is sufficient for the envisaged purpose. It has, however, appeared that, for other applications, a need exists for a still further improvement of the heat transfer, in particular in view of a reduction of the dimensions of the heat exchangers and an adaptation of the operation thereof to widely differing working conditions. The invention provides such a heat exchanger by using a good heat conducting partition wall with wire loops of a good heat conducting metal soldered to one side thereof, said heat exchanger being characterised in that also to the other side of the partition wall wire loops are soldered. If tne partition wall is a tube, said tube can be surrounded by an outer tube defining, with the partition tube, an outer flow channel, and the wire loops soldered to the outer.wall of the partition tube extend, then, substantially up to said outer tube. Within the partition tube an inner tube can be provided defining, with the partition tube, an inner flow channel, and the wire loops soldered to the inner wall of the partition tube extend, then, up to the inner tube. The wire loops are preferably arranged in helical rows around the partition tube, and the pitch of the row at the inner side is not larger than the pitch of the row at the outer side of the tube. Preferably such a heat exchanger is manufactured by arranging continuous metallic wire loop strings at both sides of a metallic par tition tube ith solder being interposed in at least the points of contact cf the loops with the tube surface in question, said loops then being soldered simultaneously to the partition tube by heating the the latter. Soldering such wire loop strings to one side of a partition tube is known per se from US 3 217 392. In the case of coaxial tube assemblies the wire loops to be provided on the inner surface of the partition tube are innitially wound on the inner tube of the assembly, and are then inserted with aaid tube into the partition tube, said loops being finally soldered to the inner surface of said tube simultaneously with the wire loops wound on the outer surface of the latter tube, the former loops being preferably fixed beforehand on the inner tube, in particular by sol doring Such a heat exchanger is particularly suitable for a device for removing vapour from a gas by cooling, e.t. for drying compressed nir, said device comprising a pump for compressing a cooling medium, Ã§n expansion valve for said medium, and an evaporatoor for said vapour the latter being in heat exchange relationship with the gas to be treated, and being connected to the suction side of said pump, in which cycle also a cooler is inserted for removing the heat which is produced when compressing the cooling medium vapour, the device according to the invention being characterised in that the evaporator is formed by a heat exchanger of the above mentioned kind. The working medium vapour is, in particular, led through the heat exchanger in the same sense as the gas to be treated, more particularly through the inner channel thereof, the cross section of this channel and the density of the wire loops in said channel being chosen so that the flow resistance of the cooling medium vapour will increase so much in respect of that of the liquid cooling medium that1 at increasing evaporation as a consequence of an increasing load, the outflow temperature of the gas flow will have substantially always the same value. In such a coaxial construction of the heat exchanger the inner tube can also be used for returning the cooling medium flowing off from the inner channel. The invention will be elucidated below in more detail by reference to a drawing, showing in Fig. 1 a laterial view with parts broken away of an embodiment of a heat exchanger according to the invention Fig. 2 a front view of this heat exchanger Fig. 3 a diagrammatical representation of a part of an air dryer with a heat exchanger of igs. 1 and 2 and Fig. 4 a graphic represe 7ion o t t, distribution of the temperature within the heat exchanger of Fig. The heat exchanger according to the invention shown inFigs. 1 and 2 is, in particular, designed for drying compressed air or the like by cooling by means of a suitable cooling medium, as will be elucidated below in more detail. The invention is, however, not restricted to such an application. This heat exchanger comprises a partition tube 1 separating a channel 2 for air to be dried from a channel 3 for the cooling medium, which tube consists of a metal with a high heat conductivity such as copper. The channel 2 is, on the other hand, defined by an outer tube 4, and the inner channel 3 by an inner tube 5. These tubes 4 and 5 do not take part in the heat transfer, and can be made of any desired material. On the partition tube 1 wire loops 6 of a good heat conducting metal such as copper are fixed by soldering, so that a good heat conduction from the loops towards the tube 1 is ensured. These loops are of the kind described in US 877252. The shape of these loops can, for example, be rectangular or trapezioidal or the like. These loops consist of a continuous wire, and are arranged along helicoidal lines around the tube 1, and, as shown, the loops of adjacent screw turns can mutually interlock. A method for manufacturing such loop rows is described in NL C 154 783. Although not necessary per Re, the loops extend up to the outer tube 4 so as to center the partition tube 1 in respect of the outer tube 4. It is, as such, not required to solder the loops to the outer tube, but the outer tube can be fixed, if required, by means of some solder tacks. At the inner side of the tube 1 wire loops 7 are provided in the channel 3 too, which are soldered to the tube 1 as well.These loops extend up to the inner tube 5 so that the latter is centred thereby. The inner tube is, as such, not required, but it is simpler to fix, initially, the loops 7 on the inner tube 5 and to solder them subsequently to the partition tube 1. If required an auxiliary core can be used instead of the inner tube which can be subsequently removed if required. Fig. 3 shows an application of this heat exchanger for drying compressed air. The air is sucked in by a pump 8 and is cooled in a cooler 9, and is, subsequently, supplied to the outer channel 2 of a heat exchanger according to Fig. 1. The loops 6 arranged in this channel provide a good heat discharge towards the partition wall 1, and, at the same time, turbulences are produced in the air flow which break possibly present laminar flows which might shield the heat discharge surfaces. The compressed air dried by cooling is led off at 10 towards a suitable pressure vessel. The channel 3 within the partition tube 1 is inserted in a duct 11 forming part of a cooling medium cycle of current design, in which an expansion valve 12 with pressure regulator 13 is inserted. The remaining elements of this cycle are not shown. In this cycle a cooling medium such as freon can be circulated, which is supplied under a high pressure to the valve 12 and is allowed to expand therein, the pressure at the outflow side of said valve being maintained at a constant value corresponding to a definite desired temperature. The flow sense in the inner channel 3 is, then, the same as in the outer channel 2. By reference to Fig. 4 the operation of this heat exchanger will be further explained. In the zero load condition, i.e.when no or very little air is delivered by the pump 8, substantially no heat will be supplied to the cooling medium flowing through the inner channel 3. Therefore substantially no evaporation of cooling medium will take place, so that the latter will flow through the channel 3 as a liquid having an outflow temperature which is substantially the same as the inflow temperature, e.g. 1 C. This is indicated by a horizontal interrupted line in the lower part of Fig.4. The flow resistance caused by the wire loops 7 in the channel 3 and by the walls 1 and 2 thereof has a definite value suitable for this purpose. The small amount of air flowing through channel 4, having for instance a temperature of 18 C, is quickly cooled to a little 0 above the temperature of the cooling medium, e.g. 2 C, at which temperature no freezing of water vapour present in the air will take place. However the cooling brings about condensation of possibly present water vapour as water, which can be removed from the heat exchanger by means of a suitable tapping opening. In the maximum load condition, when the maximum amount of air flows through the channel 2, the final temperature of the air should be substantially the same as in the case of zero load. However much heat is to be removed then, so that a considerable evaporation will take place in channel 3, and care should be taken to ensure that the cooling medium supply is adapted to the maximum load demand. The evaporation leads to an increase in volume, and there fore to an increase in velocity of the formed mixture, so that also the flow velocity will increase, which has as a consequence that the outflow pressure, and therefore the outflow temperature, decrease. This is shown in Fig. 4 by a continuous line. The wire loops 7 not only provide a uniformly distributed heat supply, but also contribute to the flow becoming turbulent which enhances the heat transfer and increases the flow resistance.As follows fron Fig. 4, the outflow temperature of the cooling medium at maximum load decreases to about 2 G, which is sufficient 0 for discharging the maximum load airflow again at about 2 C. It has appeared to be possible to adjust the flow resistance distribution at different load values by a suitable choice of the width of the channel 3 and of the density of the wire loops 7 7 in such a manner that under all circumstances substantially the same outflow temperature of the air is obtained. Since the heat transfer is considerably improved by the wire loops 6 and 7, the dimensions of such a heat exchanger can be reduced accordingly. In a heat exchanger type being taken as an example, the inner diameter of the outer tube 4 is about 60 mm and the outer diameter of the partition tube about 30 mm, the width of the channel 3 being, for instance, 3..5 mm, depending on the capacity of the device. The length of the heat exchanger should, then, not be larger than 1000 mum. Such a heat exchanger requires, therefore, little space. The interior of the inner tube 5 can, for instance, be used for returning the cooling medium, which can sometimes be favourable in view of space economy and possible heat losses. It will be clear that the invention is not restricted to the described embodiments. Since the loops 7 have a smaller height than the loops 6, the former can be wound with a smaller pitch than the latter if this is required in view of the flow resistance to be obtained in the chan nel 3. Generally the pitch of the loop strings 7 is not chosen larger than that of the loops 6. Soldering the loops 6 and 7 to the tube 1 takes preferably place simultaneously by heating the tube, solder being provided before hand, e.g. in the manner described in US 3 2117 392.
