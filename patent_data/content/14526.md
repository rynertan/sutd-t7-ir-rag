# Improvements in or relating to power amplifiers.

## Abstract
A high frequency power amplifier consists of a large number of serially connected transistors 1 . The base connec tions of the transistors are connected to a potential divider consisting of reactive components, usually capacitors 3 , which form part of a tuned circuit 3,6,7 which is resonant at the frequencies at which the amplifier is to be used. The resonant currents flowing in the potential divider ensure that sufficient base current is available for the transistors to pro vide the required amplification.
