## Description
The invention relates to balloon catheters. Balloon type catheters have numerous medical applications. They can be used for drainage e.g. urethral, Foley, colostomy, ileostomy and septostomy catheters , as diagnostic aids e.g. thermodilution catheters , for therapeutic purposes e.g. embolectomy, transluminal angioplasty, endotracheal, tracheostomy, esophageal, and intra aortic catheters , and in a wide variety of other medical applications. To date, may of the known methods of making balloon catheters have had serious deficiencies. For example, most methods were complex, required repeated attempts to achieve successful practice, and, as a consequence, were costly. Additionally, and more importantly, virtually all the known processes produce a seriously deficient product. For example, the methods disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,292,627, 3,304,353 and 3,452,756 all produce a catheter with a thermoplastic and or polyurethane balloon layer. Thermoplastic balloons, following inflation, do not revert to their original shape and size. Furthermore, polyurethane balloons are unsuitable for certain in vivo uses as urine hydrolyzes polyurethane. The procedure disclosed in the abovementioned US A 3 452 756 for producing a catheter comprises coating a thermoplastic catheter tube having an inflation hole communicating with an inflation lumen with a layer of a water soluble partitioning coating such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose or polyvinyl pyrrolidone to form a band of the coating around that portion of the tube in which the inflation hole is provided. An elastomeric thermoplastic balloon layer is then provided around the partition coating. The partition coating is described as having cracks or channels so that when air or water is forced along the inflation lumen and out through the inflation hole, this air or water is distributed throughout the circumference of the partition coating by the channels or cracks. This results in even inflation of this balloon. U.S. Patent No. 3,983,879, which forms a basis for the pre characterising part of claim 1, discloses a method for making a silicone rubber balloon type catheter. In this patent it is stated that silicone is more compatible with body tissues than the thermoplastic materials of the 627, 353 and 756 patents. US A 3 983 879 suggests that the partition coatings disclosed in US A 3 452 756 would not be suitable for use with a silicone rubber catheter tube because such coatings would be difficult to apply to silicone due to the hydrophobic nature of the latter. US A 3 983 879 therefore concludes that the partition coatings of US A 3 452 756 are not suitable in preparing silicone catheters. In the 879 patent process for manufacturing a catheter, tape is first wrapped around the inflation hole, the inflation hole being the hole which leads to the catheter s inflation lumen. The tape serves to prevent adherence of the balloon layer to the catheter tubing when the tubing is dipped in a solution of the material which forms the balloon layer. Following the formation of the balloon layer, the hole is re opened with a hot probe. This process, in addition to being complex, costly, requiring precision labour, and being subject to error particularly at the stage where the probe is used to re open the inflation hole produces a deficient product because A further technique for producing a balloon catheter is disclosed in US A 4 265 848 in which a catheter tube is initially treated with a layer of a parting compound and the tube is then sheathed with a layer of a thermoplastic or elastomeric material e.g. silicone rubber which is applied in one single operation by extrusion. There is a need for a process for making rubber balloon catheters which is easy to practice, inexpensive, and produces a balloon catheter without the deficiencies of the known products. The catheter should be made of a bio compatible material which is not hydrolyzed by body fluids. The balloon layer should be made of a material which reverts to its original shape following inflation there should be no ostensible ridges or surface irregularities in the balloon layer vicinity. Furthermore, there should be no ostensible weak spots in the balloon layer and no non compatible materials within the balloon layer. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a balloon catheter comprising According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of producing a balloon catheter from a rubber catheter tube having an inflation hole therein, the method comprising the steps of The invention has been based on the surprising finding that, contrary to the suggestion in US A 3 983 879, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, water soluble grades of polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, starch derivative and dextran can successfully be used as parting agents in catheters comprised of a rubber catheter tube and a rubber balloon layer. These parting agents are all water soluble and allow easy and complete separation of the rubber skin from the underlying surface. In addition, certain of these parting agents have special applicability as they are bio compatible and non thrombogenic. In practising the invention, a solution of rubber is applied over the parting agent. After forming an elastomer skin, the skin is separated from the surface underlying the parting agent. Due to its bio compatible nature, silicone rubber is a preferred rubber. In a preferred embodiment, the parting agent used is in solution. However, it is also possible to apply the parting agent in a solid form, e.g. film. It is preferred to dry the parting agent before application of the rubber solution, e.g. at a temperature in excess of 38 C 100 F . Polyvinyl pyrrolidone is a preferred parting agent because it is bio compatible. When PVP, or other of the abovementioned parting agents, is dried it becomes brittle thereby making its structure easy to disrupt. Following disruption, the silicone rubber skin is readily separable from the underlying surface even without the addition of water or other solvent s . In a typical procedure, a PVP coating is applied to the surface of silicone rubber tubing in an area near one or more lumen hole s . The coating is dried e.g. at a temperature of about 65 C 150 F , a solution of silicone rubber is applied over the PVP coating, and, following curing of the silicone rubber thereby forming a silicone rubber elastomer skin, the PVP coating can be mechanically disrupted. As the PVP coating is brittle from the elevated temperature curing, mechanical disruption usually fully separates the skin from the tubing and also opens the inflation hole. The product is now ready for use. It is also possible to delete this disrupting step because the parting agent coating will become so brittle after curing that by merely inflating the balloon with gas or liquid, the balloon will be fully released. The advantages of this process over the known processes include The advantages of the product formed by this process include While a preferred embodiment PVP is used as the parting agent for forming balloon catheters, it is also possible to use other parting agents, e.g., dextran, a water soluble grade of polyvinyl alcohol, methylycellulose, or starch derivatives. FIG. 1 is a side sectional view of one end of urinary drainage catheter with the balloon portion fully inflated. FIG. 2 is a sectional view of the catheter of FIG. 1 taken along the line 2 2. FIG. 3 is a side sectional view of one end of an embolectomy catheter with the balloon portion fully inflated. FIG. 4 is a sectional view of the catheter of FIG. 3 taken along the line 4 4. The catheter tubing used in forming an embolectomy catheter is an extruded section of medical grade silicone purchased from Dow Corning, with an outer diameter of approximately 2.5 mm 0.1 and an inner diameter approximately 1 3 the outer diameter. Two inflation holes are drilled opposite each other approximately 2.5 to 3.7 cm 1 to 1½ from one end of the tubing. Following drilling, the catheter tubing is thoroughly cleaned in reagent grade ethyl alcohol in order to remove any particulate matter and or debris resulting from the drilling of the inflation holes. To impart the necessary rigidity to the catheter a stainless steel wire mandrel, having a diameter slightly less than that of the tubing inner diameter, is inserted into the tubing. A ring of polyvinyl pyrrolidone is applied to the outer surface of the tubing in the area of the inflation holes. This can be performed, for example, by rotating the catheter and brushing on a solution of approximately 10 w w, 360,000 molecular weight polyvinyl pyrrolidone purchased from Polysciences, Inc. , in reagent grade ethyl alcohol. The catheter rotation can be performed by clamping both ends of the tubing with pin holders which are in turn attached to a band marking fixture, the fixture being driven by a motor and gear system. A slight tension in the tubing may be maintained to avoid sag in the tubing. Other methods of applying the PVP coating are also of course possible. Furthermore, PVP with a molecular weight of less than 360,000 may be used, however solution viscosity will be lower for a given PVP concentration. Consequently, if using lower molecular weight PVP, one must increase the solution concentration to make it suitable for paintbrush or other suitable application as the solution must not be so thin that it drips into the inflation holes and thereby enters the tubing. One should rather form a bridge of PVP over the hole. Following coating, the coated tubing is dried in an oven at approximately 65 C 150 F for 15 30 minutes or longer. Thereafter, the end portions of the tubing which have been in contact with the pin holders are cut off. By way of this cutting procedure, the distance from the inflation hole s to the end of the tubing can be adjusted as desired. The balloon layer is deposited by dipping the coated end of the tubing in a solution of medical grade silicone dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example, xylene, toluene, or 1,1,1 trichloroethane. These silicone solutions are sold under the tradenames Silastic 07 2213 Medical Grade Silicone Dispersion Dow Corning and, 521001 Medical Grade Silicone Elastomer International Silicone Corporation . Solvents of other elastomeric solutions which do not dissolve the parting agent coating are also within the scope of the invention. The balloon layer deposit step can be repeated as desired until a satisfactory balloon wall thickness is achieved. However, the rubber deposit should be dried after the application of each successive layer. Upon achieving the desired balloon thickness, the catheter is dried for about one hour at about 150 F and then cured at about 95 120 C 200 250 F for 30 60 minutes. Curing the balloon portion at such elevated temperatures results in a brittle PVP coating which can then be mechanically disrupted by simply squeezing the balloon portion. This squeezing will usually completely release the balloon from the tubing. The balloon can no be inflated with either liquid or gaseous means. While silicone is a preferred rubber for use in most medical applications due to its inert properties, use of other rubbers is also within the scope of the invention. FIGS. 3 and 4 depict an embelectomy catheter 10 formed by the above described process. Catheter 10 has two inflation holes 14 and 16, and a central bore 12. Running through bore 12 is a wire mandrel 20. The two inflation holes are provided so that the balloon will evenly inflate on either side of the catheter. However, having only one hole, or having more than two holes, is also within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, catheters having more than one balloon are also within the scope of the invention. By a procedure analogous to that described in Example 1, but instead using a tubing with a central bore 110 and an inflation lumen 112, such as the tubing 102 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 , a urinary drainage catheter can be made. The complete procedure will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. FIG. 1 shows a urinary drainage catheter 100 with a balloon 114, a drainage hole 116, and an inflation hole 118. Drainage hole 116 must be re opened following formation of the catheter 100. The balloon 114 is shown in the fully inflated position in FIG. 1, and it can be seen that the balloon 114 assumes a donut shape when fully inflated. By a process analogous to that described in Examples 1 and 2, as will be apparent skilled in the art, one can make the following balloon type catheters cardiovascular diagnostic, cardiovascular therapeutic, and cardiovascular monitoring balloon catheters e.g. thermodilution and transluminal angioplasty catheters endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes self retaining urinary, colostomy, and ileostomy balloon type conduits and drainage tubes septostomy balloon catheters, e.g. Rashkind septostomy catheter intra aortic balloon catheters esophageal balloon catheters. It is possible to use any of the other parting agents, e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose, starch derivatives, or dextran with the procedures described in any of the above examples. The precise method of use of these parting agents is well known by those skilled in the art. It should be understood that the parting agents and balloon materials used with any of the above mentioned catheters should be bio compatible. Balloons often rupture during in vivo use and the body interior is thereby exposed to any parting agent which is beneath the balloon layer. PVP is a particularly preferred parting agent as it is very bio compatible. Silicone rubber is a preferred rubber for making the balloon as if it ruptures, it tends to tear or puncture rather than shattering into multiple fragments as do certain other rubbers. Such fragments can cause a variety of problems, for example, thrombogenesis if the fragments enter the bloodstream. Additionally, silicone is a preferred material for forming the catheter tubing. With catheters made of certain plastics or other materials, it is necessary to apply a heparin coating thereto to prevent thrombogenesis. Silicone is relatively non thrombogenic thus, heparin coating is unnecessary. Moreoever, silicone rubber possesses relatively anti adhering properties to other polymers. Thus, the PVP will tend not to adhere to the tubing or the balloon and balloon release is therefore facilitated. As used in the claims, the term rubber includes natural and synthetic rubbers.
