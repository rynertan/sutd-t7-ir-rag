# A FIRING INITIATING METHOD AND DEVICE

## Abstract
A pressure impulse for initiating a pressure impulse initiatable fuse 82 is generated by an electric discharge created in a spark gap between electrodes 51, 52 of mutually opposite polarity. There are used electrodes which are movable relative to one another and voltage is applied to the electrodes when the distance between the electrodes is too great for an electric discharge to take place therebe tween whereafter the electrodes are caused to approach each other at least until a discharge occurs.
