# A RECORDING OR PLOTTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A recording or plotting apparatus has a writing device which comprises a penholder 2, 10 carrying a plurality of pens. A penholder assembly is movable from end to end of a gantry 1 which is itself movable across a record surface, such as a record sheet or card along an axis X perpendicu lar to the axis Y of movement of the penholder. Thus, for example, the gantry 1 can move in an X axis and the penholder 2, 10 can move in a Y axis. The penholder 2, 10 is provided with a plurality of writing tips 4, 5, 8 supported in a rotatable turret. The turret 9 is rotated by rotation of a ratchet provided with a plurality of ratchet teeth. The ratchet 13 and therefore the turret 9 is rotated when, in response to movement of the gantry 1 or penholder 2, 10 , a pawl 17 is engaged with one of the ratchet teeth 14 . When the gantry 1 or penholder 2, 10 is moved to disengage the pawl 17 from the ratchet tooth 14 the ratchet, and therefore the turret, is rotated, for example, by a defined angle of about 60 to place a desired one of the pen tips in contact with the record surfaces.
