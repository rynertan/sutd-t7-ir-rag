# Drawers and drawer assemblies.

## Abstract
A drawer has longitudinally extending tracks 14 in its opposite sides, each of which is adapted to co operate with a drawer runner mounted in a cabinet in which the drawer is supported in use, each of the tracks 14 incorporating means 22 to stabilise the drawer against rocking or tilting move ment during opening and closing. One form of stabilising means 22 comprises a shelf raised from the base of the associated track and extending rearwardly from the forward end thereof to engage beneath the runner 18 and prevent upward movement of the front of the drawer during initial opening and final closing movement.
