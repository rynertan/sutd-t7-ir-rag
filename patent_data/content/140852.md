# Brush holder element.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an exchangeable brush holder element, for example for a disc brush. The element comprises an elongate profile 24 with several bristle tufts 28 . The bristle tufts are orientated and formed in such a way that, as seen in a length section through the profile, they form several U s situated one beside the other.

## Description
Brush holder element This invention relates to an exchangeable brush holder element formed by an elongate profile with several bristle tufts, for example for a disc brush. Disc brushes are for example used in street sweeping machines in order to clean the ground by rotating and to move loose objects, such as gravel and litter, to a collector which lifts the objects into a container in the machine. Such brushes are described for instance in Swedish patent No. 303,992, in which the brush is a disc in which bristle tufts are detachably secured. A drawback in brushes of the said type is that it is intricate and time consuming to substitute fresh bristle tufts for worn ones, and thus as a rule the entire brush is thrown away when the bristle tufts are worn out. It has also been proposed to use discs of plastics material to which the bristle tufts are moulded. Also these brushes are thrown away after use, which involves a considerable cost. With a view to providing a brush having a separate part meant to be re used and supporting the readily exchangeable brush holder elements, it has previously also been suggested to use elongate brush holder elements which are U shaped in section and have bristle tufts fastened thereto. This is described in British patentNo. 723,385, U.S. patent No. 2,539,054 and German OS 1,956,004. However, the arrangements according to the British as well as the US patents need a particular wire to keep the bristle tufts in the U shaped profile. Moreover, the strands in the bristle tufts are folded about an axis extending in the length direction of the brush holder elements. This can be unfavourable when using strands of metal.Such strands usually have rectangular cross section, about 0.5 x 3 mm, making them very stiff when bending in one direction, whereas when bending in a direction which is 900 to said direction they are very flexible. In order to achieve a good cleaning result in combination with an acceptable lifetime, the strands have to be placed so that their wide side is directed forwards to the direction of movement. This is not possible with the folding about the wire suggested in the patents. According to the arrangement described in the German OS, the brush holder element consists of plastics in which the strands are moulded or fastened by means of clips. Also here the strands are folded and placed in the way described above in the British andUS patents. In order to avoid the above drawbacks the invention proposes a brush ring element for a disc brush having the characteristic features defined in the following claims. An embodiment of a brush to which the present invention is meant to be applied will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a vertical section through the said brush and Fig. 2 is a top plan view of this brush. Fig. 3 is a radial section through a brush ring element, andFig. 4 is a section through the brush ring element on the line IV IV of Fig. 3 perpendicular to the radial section of Fig. 3. Fig. 5 shows in what way the brush ring element is manufactured whereas Figs. 6 10 show different embodiments of the fastening of the bristle tufts. As seen in Fig. 1, the brush 10 comprises a disc 11 which is attached to a rotary shaft 14 by means of a bolt 12 and a washer 13. The outer portions of the disc have in the circumference a wide channel 15 in which a brush ring element of circular form is received, i.e. a brush ring 16 of small diameter and a brush ring 17 of larger diameter. Both brush rings are attached to the disc by several holders 18 and screws 19. The holders are in the shape of an arc with V shaped protruding portions 20 whose size decreases in the direction to the bottom 21 of the channel 15. This bottom is inclined through an angle q4 , which is preferably 10 450 to the plane P of the disc, and the associating side walls 22, 23 are correspondingly inclined. The brush rings 16 and 17 consist of a closed profile 24, preferably a square profile, one wall of which is provided with several openings 26. From the portions of the wall 25 which are situated between the openings upwardly rounded wall portions 27 project on either side of the openings to the interior of the profile.These wall portions support a U shaped bristle tuft 28, comprising a comparatively great number of bristle strands, preferably of steel, being rectangular in cross section, the rounded wall portions preventing breaking of the strands of the bristle tufts. The main direction A of the bristle tufts, i.e. an average value of the direction of the bristle strands in each bristle tuft, is orientated the angle A which is 90 1500 to the plane C of the circle described by the brush ring. The bristle tuft is retained in the profile by the area 29 of the side walls 30, 31 which is adjacent the openings 26 being deformed so as to be V shaped in section with gradually decreasing size from the wall 25 to the opposite wall 32. The manufacture of the above brush ring will now be described with reference to Fig. 5. As seen in the Figure, a square profile 24 of metal, preferably steel, is brought to pass a punch 33 which makes openings in the wall 25. Then bristle tufts 28 which have been bent to U shape are placed in the openings 26 by an implement 34. After further movement of the profile the side walls 30, 31 are deformed by the aid of a tool 35 before the entire profile is cut to suitable lenghts and, if desired, bent to the final circular shape by rolls 36. If desired, the two ends of the brush ring can then be joined together. In all the embodiments described in Figs. 6 10, the wall 25 of the profile 24 is provided with openings 26 which are limited by the rounded wall portions 27. TheU shaped bristle tufts 28 are inserted in the openings 26, and fastened. According to the embodiment in Fig. 6a, 6b, 6c, the bristle tufts are fastened by tongues 38, which have been punched out of the side walls 30 and 31 and folded into the profile so that the tongues overlap each other and press the bristle tufts 28 against the wall 32. In the embodiment according to Figs. 7a, 7b, 7c, the side walls 30, 31 are deep drawn so that a sleeve 39 is formed holding the bristle tufts and extending from each side wall 30, 31 towards the interior of the profile. In the embodiment according to Figs. 8a, 8b, 8c, a steel or plastic pipe 40 presses the bristle tufts 28 against the wall 32 and the side walls are provided with a boss 41 extending into the interior of the pipe and keeping it in a fixed position. In the embodiments shown in Figs. 9a, 9b, 9c, the bristle tufts 28 are fastened by means of lugs 42 punched out of the side walls 30, 31, whereas a steel roll 43 is used in the embodiment according to Figs. 10a,10b, 10c, the roll being kept in position by means of a lug 44 extending from each side wall 30, 31. Normally when delivered, the brush rings have already been bent to the desired diameter. This, however, means comparatively bulky transports. To reduce the transport volume the material for the brush rings can instead be delivered in straight or coiled lengths, and the consumer cuts the material to suitable lenghts and gives it the desired form. In case the two ends 37 of the brush rings are free, they are placed under the holder 18 during assembly and are locked when the holder is tightened by means of the screws 19. It is of course possible within the scope of the invention to manufacture brush ring elements which are in the form of parts of a circle and to clamp the ends under the holders.
