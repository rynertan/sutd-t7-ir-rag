# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TESTING THE OPERABILITY OF A PROBE

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an apparatus 122 and method of testing the operability of probes 30 used in performing workpiece probing operations. According to the preferrred embodiment of the present invention, the probe 30 has a first circuit means for generating a first signal, the first signal inducing the probe 30 to generate a second signal. A second circuit means is provided for receiving the second signal. The second circuit means is adapted to generate a third signal indicative of the operability of the probe 30 when the second signal is received.
