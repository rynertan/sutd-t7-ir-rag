# PHOTOMETER FOR USE WITH A MICROSCOPE

## Abstract
A photometer for use with a microscope having an object plane an image plane and an optical axis between said planes. The photometer includes an optical dividing means adapted to be disposed in the optical axis between the microscope object and image planes, and a reflective element having a reflecting surface. A pin hole occluder is adapted to be arranged on the opposite side of the optical dividing means to the reflective element. An optical imaging device provides an image of the pin hole occluder on the reflecting surface. A semi reflective element is provided for reflecting light from the light source to the optical dividing means. A detector is arranged in an optical axis including the semi reflective element, the pin hole occluder, the optical dividing means, the optical imaging device and reflective element. The object and image planes of the microscope and the reflecting surface of the reflective element are conjugate planes, so that further information additional to the pin hole occluder can be imaged into the microscope image plane.
