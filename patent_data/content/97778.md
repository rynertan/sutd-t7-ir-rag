## Abstract
A semiconductor random access memory 11 has a primary input output port 23 connected to columns of memory locations through sense amplifiers 17 . The sense amplifiers are connected to stages of a row buffer serial shift register 25 having a secondary asynchronous output port 24 . Block transfers of data can be effected to and from the memory using the secondary port. Memory throughput efficiency is improved permitting functions such as display refresh in a mapped memory display to be accomplished through the secondary port. Memory bus contention on the primary port is also relieved. The main input output port is thereby free to receive new data for a higher percentage of available transfer time because refresh data is available at the secondary port.
