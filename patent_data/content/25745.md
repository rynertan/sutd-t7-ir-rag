## Description
PROCESS FOR PROPAGATING HURON HEPATITIS A INVITRO CELL CULTURE.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prior art methods for obtaining hepatitis A antigen as disclosed by Provost et al. in U.S.patent 4,029,764 involved intravenous inoculation of a non human primate with hepatitis A virus with subsequent removal of the infected liver and recovery of virus therefrom. Another method disclosed byProvost et al. in U.S. patent application SerialNo. 934,293 filed 17 August 1978, now U.S. patent 4,164,566 , involves one or more passages of hepatitisA virus in a sub human primate, removing infected liver tissue and using such tissue to inoculate an in vitro cell culture, incubating the cell culture until hepatitis A antigen is detectable, and carrying out at least one additional in vitro cell culture passage of the virus. A disadvantage of these processes is that they require the use of primates that are not only expensive but in short supply and difficult to obtain.An in vitro cell culture system which did not require the use of primates would be a significant advance in this art. OJBECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method for the in vitro cellCulture of hepatitis A virus. Another object is to provide a method for propagation of hepatitis A virus which does not require the use of primates. A further object is to provide a method for the preparation of hepatitis A antigen for use in human vaccines and as a diagnostic antigen. Still another object is to provide an in vitro method for attenuating the virulence of hepatitis A antigen. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Hepatitis A virus is propagated in cell culture in vitro by direct inoculation of the cell cultures with human clinical specimens containing the virus.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to the in vitro cell culture propagation of hepatitis A virus and, more particularly, to in vitro cell culture propagation of hepatitis A virus wherein the inoculum is a human clinical specimen containing the virus. The present invention provides a method for propagating hepatitis A virus wherein passage of the virus in a susceptible non human primate prior to in vitro cell culture is not required. According to the present invention a clinical specimen containing hepatitis A virus, e.g. stool extract, saliva, urine, or blood, is used as inoculum to infect a susceptible in vitro cell culture.The cell culture may be formed of primary, continuously cultivated, or transformed cells derived from kidney or liver of human or non human primate origin, specific examples of suitable cell cultures are those derived from fetal or newborn kidney cells from rhesus monkey FRhK6 , cynomolgus monkey, or cercopithecus monkey, or diploid fibroblast cells derived from human or nonhuman primate lung tissue such as, for example, WI 38 orMRC 5 cell lines. The inoculated cell culture is incubated for an extended period of time until positive results are obtained for the presence of hepatitisA antigen. By an extended period of time is meant an incubation of at least about 25 days, and preferably from about 25 up to about 100 days. The incubation is carried out in the presence of a nutrient medium which maintains the cells at temperatures permitting propagation of the virus in the cell culture.Typically, such temperatures are from about 30 to about 390C.The nutrient medium may be, for example, Eagle sMinimum Essential Medium EMEM , Williams MediumE, Medium 199, Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium,RPMI Media or Basal Medium Eagle with 0.5 fetal calf serum. The cultures are subsequently harvested and serial passages of the viral agent are carried out.As indicated above the virus may be propagated by serial passages in diploid fibroblast cells derived from human or non human primate lung tissue. Propagation is effected through at least about 5 serial passages in the diploid fibroblast cells. Preferably propagation is effected through from about 5 to about 50 passages in the diploid fibroblast cells. Most preferably, prior to passage in the diploid fibroblast cells the virus is propagated in a cell culture derived from primary, continuously cultivated or transformed cells derived from kidney or liver of human or non human primates.Propagation is effected through from about 5 to about 25 passages in the kidney or liver of human or non human primates. This invention allows disease diagnosis by direct virus isolation. Further, it allows the in vitro cultivation of the virus in adequate quantity and with appropriate properties for the preparation of human vaccines and diagnostic antigen. The following examples illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting the same thereto. EXAMPLE 1 A 20 percent extract of human stool inPBS is prepared from acutely ill human hepatitis A patients and clarified by centrifugation. It gives an immune adherence titer of 1 16 for hepatitis A antigen. It is further diluted 1 5 in cell culture medium containing 0.5 fetal calf serum and filtered through a 0.454 Millipore filter. One ml of this material is inoculated per 25 cm2 flask of fetal rhesus kidney FRhK6 cells. The inoculum is left in place for 4 hours and then removed. Five ml ofEMEM containing 0.5 fetal calf serum plus neomycin and glutamine is added per flask and the medium removed and renewed at 5 7 day intervals with incubation at 32 350C. Coverslips are removed periodically and examined by the direct immunofluorescence technique Provost et al., P.S.E.B.M., 160, 213 221, 1979 for hepatitis A antigen.Such examination is essentially negative until day 33 post inoculation, when the first clear positive results are obtained. The cultures are subsequently harvested at day 37 and the cells disrupted by freeze thawing and sonication.Cellular debris is removed by low speed centrifugation.The supernatant product gives a positive result by radioimmunoassay for hepatitis A antigen. EXAMPLE 2 A second passage of the virus in FRhK6 cells is achieved by inoculating 0.5 ml of the supernatant product from Example 1 into fresh cell cultures, which are handled comparably to those above. Fluorescence antibody examination reveals the first clear evidence of virus presence at day 15 post inoculation. The cultures are harvested at day 19 post inoculation and the product gives a positive result for hepatitisA antigen by radioimmunoassay. Additional serial passage of the virus is carried out in cell culture, i.e. passages 3, 4 and 5. By passage 5, heavy virus growth occurs as early as 7 14 days and the virus harvest at day 14 gives strong positive immune adherence IA and radioimmune assay RIA hepatitis A antigen results. EXAMPLE 3 Antigen, 0.05 ml. obtained as described in Example 2, is incubated with human convalescent hepatitis A sera, 0.02 ml of a 1 20 dilution. The mixture is incubated at 370C for 1 hour and then held at 40C for a period of three hours. A drop of the material is placed onto a carbon coated, 300 mesh copper grid, and allowed to adsorb for 30 seconds. The grid is then stained for 2 minutes with 2 aqueous phosphotungsic acid, pH 6.0 adjusted with 1NKOH and examined in a Philips 300 electron microscope at 80KV. After reaction with hepatitis A antibody, characteristics halos of antibody molecules are seen to surround the numerous 27 mW hepatitis A virus particles and to bind them into an immune complex. EXAMPLE 4 The final infected cell culture harvests obtained from Example 2, prepared under aseptic conditions, are treated with 1 4000 formalin at 370C for 72 hours. Excess residual formalin is neutralized with sodium bisulfite. All treatments are performed under aseptic conditions. The product is stored at 40CSubcutaneous or intramuscular injection of 4 doses of 1 ml given at 2 week intervals into S. mystax marmosets and quinea pigs induces circulating hepatitis A antibody in these animals. Further, the marmosets are rendered resistant to challenge with virulent doses of hepatitis A virus. EXAMPLE 5 Hepatitis A virus derived as in Example 1 is serially passaged a total of 15 times in fetal rhesus monkey kidney cells at 350 C. The virus harvest from passage 15 is then successfully propagated in human diploid lung HDL cell cultures at 320C. A total of 5 serial in vitro passages of the virus inHDL are carried out. After such passage the hepatitisA virus is attenuated in virulence for both marmosets S. labiatus and chimpanzees in that intravenous inoculation into these animals produced no serum enzyme elevations e.g. isocitric dehydrogenase and only minor changes in liver histopathology while at the same time eliciting a hepatitis A antibody response. All animals inoculated with the attenuated virus resist challenges with 1000 50 infectious doses of virulent hepatitis A virus injected intravenously.Thus the tissue culture passaged hepatitis A virus constitutes a live, attenuated hepatitis A vaccine.
