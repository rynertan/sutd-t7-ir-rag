## Description
eat shield arrangements for material e s in strip or bar bir aorta This invention relates to heat shields and it is concerned particularly, but not exclusively, with heat shields for use in metal processing. In steel mill processing whether of billets, strip or sections, the metallurgical qualities of finished product are closely related to the accurate control of temperature of the material during the hot rolling process. Bor example, a modern hot strip mill producing steel coil is several hundred metres long and, trpically, steel slabs or billets may be reduced from 25 cms thickness to 0.2 cms using several roughing mill stands and five or more finishing mill stands. During the rolling process considerable heat losses occur so that the slabs have to be heated initially well in excess of the temperature requirement at the end of the process, but a particular problem has been that the heat losses from slabs passing along the mill depend upon the time taken. If the slabs are delayed, excessive heat losses occur and the steel strip does not have its required rolling temperatures, so that it may have to be downgraded or even scrapped. In many long modern rolling mills the delay of one length of strip at the finishing end has an effect on the several lengths of material which are simultaneously at various preceding stages of rolling. Thus with more stringent quality specifications it is becoming more important to reduce the rate of heat loss from the material during transport between stands. There is an added difficulty in this because during the final reduction stages the back end of the strip takes longer to pass through the finishing mills and so there is a temperature run down along the steel strip due to the cumulative time delay along the length of the strip. The effect of temperature run dovm is to someextent. ameliorated by accelerating the finishing mills during the rolling of each individual slab or strip, but nevertheless it remains a problem. Attempts have been made in tne past to reduce the heat loss from the top surface of a hot strip during transport from the roughing mills to the finishing mills.Because radiation is a major source of heat loss at the temperatures involved around 10600C aluminium reflectors have been fixed over the path of the hot strip to reduce temperature run down . However maintenance problems limit the usefulness of reflectors which become inefficient as soon a3 they become dirty, and in addition, the aluminium reflectors which ha.ve been used for their high reflectivity and relatively low cost can reach their melting temperature if their reflectivity decreases. It has been proposed UK patent 1 040 20 to use heat insulating or reflecting panels as heat shields that present to the hot material a face formed by a thin plate of stainless steel backed by a core of thermal insulation, so that the plate forming the hot face of the panel is preheated to a luminous temperature close to that of the material being processed. In this arrangement, however, the panel could be easily damaged if there is a malfunction that causes material being processed to strike the panel, for example if the material is bent or if it lifts as it rues along its path. A mishap of this kind can easily occur in a steel rolling mill in which the steel stock is often travelling at very high speis. According to one aspect of the present. invention, there is provided a heat shield arrangement for hot material being processed in a hot rolLing mill, e.g. for metal strip or for rolled metal sections, the arran geent comprising a series of heat insulating panels above the path of the material being processed, the panels each having a heat insulating core and a cover plate forming or overlying a main face of the panel being adapted to act as a hot face presented to the material being processed and to radiate heat back to the material, characterised in that the series of panels are provided with drive means for displacing them on their supports upwardly away from the path of the material and sensing means being provided comprising a contact member upwardly displaceable relative to the panels being provided to detect lifting or distortion of the material and t6 actuate automatically said drive means to lift the panels away from the material to protect them against damage. It is thus possible to provide contact elements projecting downwardly in the region of the cover plates of the upper group of panels to below the level of the cover plates, said contact elements being of a relative robust nature compared with the panel cover plates and acting as sensing means for operating control means.that actuate said panel displacement means, whereby if the material lifts and strikes the contact means the displacement means are immediately actuated to lift the panels away from the hot strip material. In the arrangement disclosed in UK patent 1 040 420, the heat insulating panels are disposed in series over a rolling mill delay table, so as to reduce the loss of heat from hot sheet material on the table, and a pyrometer imnediately in front of each panel is able to actuate displacement of its panel transuersely away from the table. Thus, when tne strip advnces onto the delaJ liable each insulating panel will be moved to its operative position over the strip if the pyrometer senses a strip temperature significantly less than a preset value, and if the temperature rises above the preset value the panels are displaced laterally clear of the table and the strip. This arrangement, however, is only of limited value because it relies upon the temperature of the strip being sufficiently uniform over the region of each panel for effective control of the panel temperature to be obtained by the positioning of the heat insulating panel in one of its two alternative positions. There can in fact be significant local temperature gradients, and it has been found that there may in particular be significant temperature differences across the width of a sheet of hot material so that there is likely to be a substantially higher rate of cooling of the outer lateral margins of the sheet as compared with its central region. According to another aspect of the present invention,, a heat shield arrangement is provided comprising a series of heat insulating panels mounted above a path for t ne hot material, the panels each having a heat insulating core and a cover plate forming or overlying a main face of each .panel being adapted to act as a hot face presented to the material being processed and to radiate heat back to the material, characterised in that the panels of the series are arranged in groups of two or more panels disposed side by side across the lateral extent of the path of the material, and means are connected to said plurality of panels for displacing the panels with respect to each other for varying their heat insulating effect on a central region of the hot material relative to the lateral margins thereof, at least one array of temperature sensors being laterally spaced across the material path, and control means actuated by said sensors being connected to said displacement means in order to control the temperature and or the transverse temperature profile of the material being processed in accordance with predetermined vales. Said displacement of the panels may take place by movement of the laterally oppose panels towards any away from each other, maintaining their height above the material path, or it can involve tilting of the panels so that the7 are raised relative to the central region of the material path and therefore have a lesser effect there, but preferably the displacement means are adapted to provide both these motions alone or in cotbinstion. A heat shield arrangement according to the invention preferably also has heat insulating panels disposed below the material path. These panels also may be arranged to be displaceable for varying the heat insulating effect across the widths of the material, e,g. by pronding means for moving them laterally towards and away from each other. On a conventional strip mill delay table, the sheet material path is defined by a series of rollers on which the material is supported. According to a preferred feature of the invention, said rollers comprise upper smaller diameter rollers upon which the material rests, and lower larger diameter rollers that support the upper rollersIn this way, it is possible to increase the proportion of the lower face of the material path that is shielded by the lower series of heat insulating panels, since these panels can overlap the larger rollers to extend close to the upper, smaller diameter rollers. There is a further advantage arising from the use of the smaller diameter upper rollers in that the heat transfer by conduction through these will be less than for the larger diameter rollers of a conventional rolling mill table. This loss can be still further reduced by limiting the contact area between the upper and lower rollers, in particular by arranging that the upper rollers are only in contact with a plurality of axially spaced larger diameter portions formed on the lower rollers. Preferably, the upper series of panels are mounted on support means provided with a raising mechanism which allows them to be raised to gain access to the conveying path, and the raising mechanism may be arranged to operate automatically to protect the panels should there be a malfunction that causes the material being processed to lift and strike the panels. The control of the temperature of material being processed by varying the heat shielding effect transversely across the material is not appropriate in some instances, for example in processing narrow cross section materials such as bars and rolled sections. In these instances, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a heat shield arrangement comprising heat insulating panels disposed along a path of the material being processed, the panels each having a beat ipsulating core snd a coverplate forming or overlying the face of each panel being adapted to act as a hot face presented to the material being processed and to radiate heat back to the panel, characterised in that the panels form a tubular enclosure to surround all sides of the material path with the upper and lower regions of said conduit being provided by respective upper and lower panels, and at least some of the panels being mounted on displaceable support means to open the tubular enclosure. Conveniently, contact means for the material being processed are provided for operation of the displacement means of the displaceably mounted panels in order to lift said panels away to avoid damage by material that is distorted or that has sifted as already discussed. In a preferred construction for the performance of the invention, each panel comprises a core of fibrous ceramic material providing a heat insulating layer and enclosed in a protective casing, the cover plate forming or overlying a main face of said casing and being c.apable of relative thermal expansion with respect to the casingsIf the cover plate is made relatively thin to have a low thermal capacity, at least a part of its area may be provided with dimples, corrugations or other locally contoured formations to increase the heat emissivity of its surface and such contouring may also be arranged to contribute to the strength of the cover plate and its ability to withstand thermal stresses, as well as to allow a measure of independent thermal expansion by flesure. The casing may comprise a peripheral housing that supports the cover plate in a manner that permits relativs thermal e2pansion of the cover layer, and the opposite mmin face of the panel forming its cold face may similarly be provided with a cover plate mounted in a manner permitting relative thermal expansion, so that thermal stresses on the casing are kept to a minimum. Preferably, the casing provides a substantially dust tight enclosure for the insulating core and venting apertures may be arranged in the casing for the escape of air and stean from within, the apertures being provided with valves for preventing or limiting a return flow through them. The invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a transverse cross section of a transfer conveyor or roller table in a steel strip mill provided with a heat shield arrangement according to the invention, and also shows in outline some of the modes of adjustment of the arrangement, Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of the control means for the arrangement of Fig. 1, .Fig. 3 illustrates the movement of the support arms in the arrangement of Big. 1, Fig. 4 illustrates a protective device for the arrangement of Fig. 1, Fig. 5 is a longitudinal vertical cross section showing details of the heat insulation panels in the arrangement of Fig. 1, Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate details of a modified panel front plate construction for use in the invention, Fig. 8 is a longitudinal section showing a feature of a heat shield arrangement according to the invention that may be also used in conjunction with the arrangement of Fig. 1, Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate in mutually transverse sections a modified roller construction that can be employed in a roller table provided with a heat shield arrangement according to the invention, Big. 11 is a transverse cross section of a further heat shield arrangement according to the invention, and Figs. 12 and 13 show schematically alternative heat insulation panels for the arrangement in Fig. 11. Referring firstly to Hig. 1 of the drawings, respective upper and lower series of heat insulating panels 2,4 are mounted abode and below the material path M along a roller table of a steel strip mill. The panels of each series are SnO AT mounted in pairs side by side but in wider mills four panels side by side may be required. The panels are arranged in a row or rows extending along the strip conveying direction to make up the required heat shield area. Running longitudinally with te upper series of panels, but not directly secured to them are skid or bumper bars 6 or like contact members that project below the panels intermediate their width. The upper panels 2 are mounted on displaceable support means comprising a series of cantilever arms 10 at intervals along the material path, each arm extending over the conveyor rolls 12 for the steel strip M, so that the panels are able to cover the entire upper face of the strip. The cantilever arms are displaceable to move the panels.towards and away from the strip, and te panels themselves are displaceable on the support structure to regulate their effect on the strip. For the latter purpose the panels 2 may be conveniently arranged in pairs with the central bumper bar 6 independently mounted between them. The panel.s are supported by transverse guides or rails 14 that are secured below the cantilever arms and are suspended from rollers 16 running on the rails so that they can be displaced laterally towards and away from each other by first displacement means consisting of rams 18 as indicated by the arrows A in Fig. 1.Each rail is pvoted at its inner end 20 and connected by further displacement means consisting of rams 22 to the arms 10, so that by operation of the rams the rails can be tilted about their pivots, and in particular can be so tilted as tosranse the laterally outer edges of theypanels as shown in outline in Fig. 1. The lower heat shield panels 4 below the strip path are also mounted through rollers 23 on rails 24 or like guides, which in this instance are fixed, so as to be movabl e laterally inwards and outwards by displacement means consisting of rams 26 in the same manner as the upper panels. he movements of the rams during the operation of the arrangement to control the temperature of a steel strip travelling along the conveyor path is governed by a control unit 30 Fig 2 receiving signals from an array of temperature sensors 32 disposed across the width of e s ,rn strip. If the sensors indicate that the tempemature at the edges of the strip is too high, the rams 22 between the cantilever arms and the upper rails 14 can be operated to tilt the outer edges of the upper panels upwards, the angle being adjusted to suit the required heat loss rate.If, on the other hand, the temperature at the centre of the strip is too high the panels 2 and or 4 can be traversed on their rails so as to leave a gap at the centre, both above and below the strip, to allow increased radiation from that region.The extent of the opening movement and the number of panels opened along the length of the conveyor path can both be adjusted to suit the extent of the temperature correction required, It is also possible to lift the support structure comprising the cantilever arms 10, together with the panels 2, this serving both as a means Qf temperature control for the strip and as a means oS protection of the panels against damage from a bent or buckled stripe For this purpose, as may be more clearly seen from Fig. 3, each an 10 is mounted on a fixed frame 36 through a lifting mechanism comprising a normally horizontally shorter link 38 pivoted at 40 to the lower end of the arm and a longer link 42 pivoted at 44 intermediate the length of the arm and normally lying parallel to the cranked end portion of the arm. The arm 10 is displaced by drive means comprising a ram 46 attached to one end 48 to the frame 36 and its other end 50 being connected to the longer link 42. The mechanism operates, when the ram 46 is extended, to produce a magnified pivoting movement of the arm 10, as shown in Fig. 3, the stroke of the ram being set so that the panels can be raised to a nearly vertical position, leaving clear access to the roller table. As already indicated, the ram 46 can be operated by the automatic control means to regulate the temperature of the material. This can be done when it is required to lower the temperature of the strip as a whole rather than alter the temperature distribution, and normally it will be sufficient for only a small length of the total length of the upper series of heat shield panels to be lifted away for this purpose. The number of panels so raised will determine the cooling effect obtained. The rams 46 may also be automatically operated if à bent or buckled strip is in the mill. The bumper bars 6 provide initial protection in this eventuality, but they can also be provided with sensor elements not shown such as pressuresensitive switches so that as the strip bears against them to lift them, the sensor elements actuate the rams 46 and the upper panels are immediately raised clear of the strip, whether or not they have actually been contacted by the deformed strip. It will be understood that the control unit may comprise means for readily adjusting the set points or required temperature limits to suit different materials being processed, and there may be a number of arrays of temperature sensors at different stations along the length of the strip conveyor path, either operating upon the same control unit or operating upon separate control units for individual stations of the conveyor path. Additionally or alternatively to the bumper bars, one or more further support arms may carry a bent stock detector 62 Figs. 2 and 4 having a contact member disposed over the conveyor upstream of the panels to indicate the approach of raised parts of the strip that might damage the panels and thereby actuate lifting of the panels.The detector cam comprise a support arm 64 having a simple pivot mounting 66Cortrolled by a ram 68t to swing the detector clear of the conveyor when required, but it may alternatively have the same form of displacement mechanism as the panel support arms 10. The pamels 2,4 may be coztructed in a preferred form shos Fig. 5. In this, the upper panel comprises a casing containing a two layer core of heat insulating material consisting of high temperature ceramic fibre board zn sniation 74 adjoining a bottom cover plate 73 forming the hot face of the panel, the insulation 74 being backed by lower temperature insulating board 75. The cover plate 73 is formed by a thin sheet of temperature resistant material, e.g. stainless steel, which material can be made either heat reflecting or absorbing, and preferably has corrugations, dimples or other local contouring.The cover plate rests upon heat resistant .angle sectioz frame 77 of the casing, which allows free thermal expansion of the plate, and slots 76 in the frame also allow its relative thermal expansion. The top of the panel is sealed by a top plate 80 to which is fixed a mounting lug 81. The cover plate is held from above againstthe horintal flanges of the frame 77 by leaf springs 78 to help provide a seal between the plate and the frame and so minimize the intrusion of dirt and steam into the, ceramic fibre core. Vents 79 can also be provided in the side walls of the molrnting frame 77 to facilitate the escape of steam if, as during periods of inactivity, water is absorbed by the core and is subsequently vaporized by the heating that occurs when the panel begins to be used again. One way flap valves 94 on the vents 79 help to prevent the ingress of steam from the surroundings.It should be noted that if the cover plate is very thin, extra retaining clips 83 may be required to hold it against the ceramic. fibre material of the core. In iany respects the lower panels are of similar construction to the upper panels. As shown in Fig. 5, each lower panel is supported on the table base plate 85 and can rest thereon either directly or through brackets 86. The cover plate 87 forming the hot face of the lower panel has local contouring like the plate 73 but forms an integral part cx an outer casing of welded construction with stainless steel side walls 88 and base 89 as below the strip greater protection is needed against the ingress of foreign matter.The contouring is preferably in the form of a series of parallel corrugations arranged particularly to accommodate thermal expansion of the hot face relative to the remainder of the panel, but b.ecause the cover plate is restrained at its edges, the casing is made relatively narrow in the direction of the corrugaSionst e.g. some half the length transverse thereto. The corrugations. also increase the effective emissivity of them hot face, as mentioned above, and strengthen the relntivel yDthin material. The base of the casing has one or more corrugations 90 or like local contouring to allow differential thermal expansion and the panel is filled with a core of higher and lower temperature insulating ceramic fibre panels 91, 92 respectively, similar to the upper panel core. Small steam vents 93 are provided in the base of the panel to allow venting of trapped water and these are normally closed by onevay flap halves 94. Heat radiated from the strip will impinge on the cover plates of the panels. Initially the front end of the strip will cool at almost the rate it would achieve in free air while the cover plates are cool. If the plates are thin for example, less than 1 50th of the thickness of the hot strip then their temperature will quickly rise towards the strip temperature without a significant drop in. strip temperature, and as heat loss into the pnels is minimised by the thermally insulating core and the panels almost immediately begin to re radiate heat, and temperature e4uilibrium is established with the strip t6 give it a more uniform temperature as it enters a roll stand. The total effective emissivity of the cover plates of the re radiating panels is increased by the substantial corrugating or dimpling or like. local contouring of their surface, and since the cover plates are preferably very thin such contouring can serve to strengthen the plates and allow local flexing to facilitate relaxation, of thermal stresses set up by rapid heating and cooling of the plates. The cover plates can be heatreflecting but in general it will be found convenient to make them black to suit the dirty environmental conditions and in this case they can operate better to improve the temperature distribution in the common condition of a strip with a higher temperature leading end, or where there is some time 1 at In the passage of the traling end to a roll stand. In some circumstances it may be required not only to conserve the heat in the material being processed but also to apply further heating. For example, this might be necessary if the material is to be held at a constant temperature. It is possible then to provide heating means in or on the insulation panels thenselves, as is illastratedin Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. These show a multilayer cover plate, with a front plate 101 forming the hot face of the panel, a first electrically insulating layer 102, an electrical strip heating element 103 capable of operating at a temperature of 1100 C or more, a second insulating layer 104, and a back plate 1051that like the front plate is suitable for use at high temperatures.The bayers are secured together byhollow rivets 106 that may also serve to receive suspension ties 107 for the panel, although panels with cover plates of this construction are suitable for mounting both above and below the material being shielded. To maintain the material temperature, the element 103 may be of relativelz low power, e.g. up to 5 kw m2, but higher powers may be used when required. It will be clear without further illustration that the control unit 30 can also regulate the operation of the heating elements. The use of panels with heating elements is shown in the heat shield arrangement in Fig. 8, although tubular sheathed elements 103a are illustrated. This example shows a further heat conservation measure, it being assumed that the arrangement is employed with an existing steel mill roller table, which will be equipped with large diameter rollers 110 of high thermal capacity, often water cooled.The upper and lower thermal insulation panels 111, 11 2 have the general composite construction already described and both series of panels are arranged in pairs side by side, with a central skid bar or like contact member 113 and 114 respectively, between the panels of each pair. The lower panels are also so constructed that there are two or more successive panels along the distance between adÅaaczent rollers 110, and between these successive panels lifting members in the form of transversely extending lifting bars 115 are interposed.These bars, of a high temperature alloy and possibly also provided with heat insulation, can be raised, e.g. by fluid pressure rams 116, to the position shown and so lift the material M from the rollers 110. The mechanism can be used when the operation of the mill requires the material on the roller table to be stopped for any significant length of time. Because of the thermal mass and or the cooling of the rollers, there would be the risk that cold spots would develop in the material at the regions of contact with the rollers, and that these would affect the uniformity of the final product.. The problem of avoStug undue heat loss to the rollers can alternatively be overcome by modification of the roller table construction in the manner illustrated inFigs. 9 and 10. The main supporting rollers 120 have smaller rollers 121 resting on them, the rollers 121 being of a heat insulating material. Both series of rollers are journalled in a housing assembly 122 and are driven together, as by the gearing 123. It may be arranged that the housing assembly can readily be opened to remove the rollers 121 at least, when servicing is needed. The upper heat insulating panels 124 can be lifted clear in the manner already described when this is to be done. The main rollers preferably have reduced diameter portions 125 so that the contact area between the rollers 120, 121 is confined to the relatively small extent of the larger diameter portions 126, so reducing any heat loss through conduction. Pf scale drops from the material on the table this measure also helps the scale to fall clear It is a further advantage in the use of the smaller diameter high temperature rollers that the lower heat insulating panels 127 caD be brought closer together, so that there is a further reduction of heat loss by radiation. The invention is not restricted to installations in which the heated material is in strip form, and Figs. ii to 13 illustrate the application of the invention to control the temperature of bar or profiled section stock roving along a conveyor path. Mounted on a fixed frame 131 are drive rollers 132 for the stock 133, snoa here as a square section bar, driven by one or more motors 134. The conveyor path runs perpendicular to the plane of the figure. Nountings 136 pivotable about an axis,137 parallel to the conveyor path carry upwardly projecting side support rollers 138 for the stock and lower heat shield panels 140 of the composite construction already described. Together with upper U form panels 141 of similar construction these lower panels 140 form a tubular enclosure 139 for the stock.The upper panels 141 are displaceable on pivotable support means 142 that allow them to be swung upwards to the broken line position by rams 143, clear of the conveyor and the stock on it. When the upper panels have been swung away in, this manner, the side support rollers 138 can be pivoted downwards to give free access to the stock, in particular to allow bent or damaged stock to be removed more easily. The pivoting of the mountings 136 for the bottom panelszallows them to be tilted when the installation is being serviced to shaice off any accumulation of mill scale or other foregn matter. Because the top panel has a cross sectional profile that increases its stiffness as compared with the flat panels so far described, it can be made considerably longer It may have flat faces 144 or axial cormugatises 145 can be provided to stiffen the inner cover plate, as has already been described. This inner cover plate is allowed some freedom to expand axially and laterally and is retained in place by lipped edges 146 of the panel casing and heatresistant ties 147 passing through the inner core of insulating material. A contact member or bumper bar 148 projects through the top panels to protect them from being damaged by out of shape material.As already described, be the bar car displac.eably mounted relative to the panels 141 and be provided with impact sensors 149 arranged to trigger the operation of the lifting rams 143 for raising the top panels. The oross sectional profile of the panels can be varied, for example, to suit a particular cross section profile material, as is exemplified in Figs. 12 and 13.In Fig. 12, like the upper panel 141, the bottom panel 151 also has a U form profile increasing its stiffness and the radiussing of the cover plates at the inner corners 152 of the panels can improve the uniformity of the temperature of the stock passing through the arrangement. The corners of rectangular stock or even of the outer edges of the flanges of the I section shown will normally radiate heat more freely and so cool faster, but the increased insulation of the radiussed corners of the panels has an opposite and therefore compensating effect. X similar effect can be obtained with the configuration shown inFig. 13, where both panels 153 have a semi circul ar cross section. The other features described with reference to Fig. 11 can of course also be provided in heat shield arrangements using these panels of different profiles.
