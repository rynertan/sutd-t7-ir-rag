## Description
This invention relates to conjugates of proteins with anti tumour agents, and more particularly to conjugates of apotransferrin with anti tumour agents. The invention also relates to methods for preparing such conjugates. Transferrin is a protein which occurs in blood plasma, including human blood plasma, and which has an important function in the transport of iron. The role of transferrin in heme synthesis in developing red blood cells has been widely studied, and the presence of transferrin receptors on reticulocytes has been noted. Ceruloplasmin is a copper binding glycoprotein which also occurs in blood plasma. It has been suggested that modified ceruloplasmin might fit into transferrin receptors. It has been noted recently that transferrin receptors are to be found on the surfaces of tumour cells. It has been suggested that research into breast cancer therapy might be approached through the use of transferrin labelled with cytotoxic agents Faulk et al, The Lancet, August 23, 1980, page 392 . A favoured approach to producing tumour specific drugs has involved the linking of cytostatic drugs such as daunomycin, adriamycin and methotrexate, to antibodies against tumour associated surface antigens. The ability of such complexes to kill malignant cells selectively has, so far, been limited. An alternative, and more recent approach has been to link a toxin, instead of a cytostatic drug, to the antibody. Following the identification of transferrin receptors on the surfaces of tumour cells by Faulk and Galbraith Proc. Roy. Soc. B 204 83 97, 1979 , Trowbridge and Domingo Nature, Vol. 294, page 171, 1981 have obtained monoclonal antibodies against the transferrin receptor of human cells, and have coupled such antibodies to ricin or diphtheria toxin sub units. They found that the growth of human tumour cells was specifically inhibited In surprising contrast to the results of Trowbridge and Domingo, it has now been found that when an anti tumour agent is conjugated with apotransferrin, not only does the protein moiety retain its affinity for transferrin receptors, but, moreover, the anti tumour agent retains its anti tumour properties. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a conjugate of a protein with a cytotoxic agent characterised in that the conjugate is a conjugate of apotransferrin linked via a residue of glutaraldehyde as a linking agent with an anti tumour agent selected from adriamycin, methotrexate, vincristin, daunomycin, 6 mercaptopurine, cytosine arabinoside, and cyclophosphamide. More preferably, the anti tumour agent is adriamycin. The apotransferrin is preferably of human origin, though any apotransferrin may be used which can bind to transferrin receptors on the surface of the tumour cell which it is desired to treat. Preferably, the apotransferrin conjugate is separated from conjugates which comprise aggregated apotransferrin molecules and or fragments of apotransferrin molecules cross linked by glutaraldehyde. Such aggregates and or fragments may be separated from the desired conjugates by, for example, gel filtration chromatography. Also provided by the present invention are conjugates of apotransferrin as described above, for use in the treatment of tumours. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reagent kit for the treatment of tumours, comprising iron bearing transferrin and a conjugate of apotransferrin with an anti tumour agent as described hereinbefore. Such of the patient s normal cells which have transferrin receptors may be protected against the effects of the conjugate by saturating these receptors with the iron bearing transferrin before administration of the conjugate. The present invention also provides a process for determining the susceptibility of tumour cells to anti tumour agents, comprising administering separately to portions of said tumour cells conjugates of apotransferrin with a number of different anti tumour agents. A reagent kit comprising a number of such different conjugates may be provided for this purpose. It has been found that the conjugates of the present invention are taken up extremely rapidly by tumour cells. This means that within a matter of hours of removal from the patient, tumour cells may be tested against a range of conjugates of apotransferrin with different anti tumour agents. Such a process would enable the chemotherapy which is most effective for a given patient to be determined as soon as possible after isolation of the tumour cells. There are now described, by way of example, conjugates of apotransferrin according to the present invention, conjugates of ceruloplasmin, for the purpose of comparison and a method for preparing the same, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which HL 60 acute promyelocytic leukemia and Daudi Burkitt s lymphoma cells, were grown in suspension at 37 C in RPMI 1640 medium with L glutamine, 25mM HEPES Gibco European, Glasgow, Scotland , 50 mcg ml gentamicin Flow Laboratories, Ayrshire, Scotland and supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum Sera Lab Ltd., Crawley Down, Sussex, England , this combination being hereafter referred to as complete medium. Human venous blood was collected into acid citrate dextrose solution, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBM were separated from venous blood samples with the use of Isolymph Gallard Schlesinger Chemical Mfg. Corp., Carle Place, New York, USA . Viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. To a solution containing 10 mg of either human transferrin Trf 99 iron free, from Behringwerke AG, Marburg, W. Germany, i.e. apotransferrin or human ceruloplasmin Cer prepared as described by Pegandier, Z. Cells 1 x 10⁶ were reacted with 100 µl of Adr, Trf or Trf Adr conjugate for 20 minutes at 4 C or for 3 hours at 37 C, washed twice in Hank s balanced salt solution HBSS, Gibco Europe at 4 C and reacted with 100 µl of a 1 20 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC conjugate of goat anti human Trf Atlantic Antibodies, Maine, USA . This antibody did not react with Daudi or HL 60 cells prior to their exposure to human Trf. Following incubation with anti Trf, the cells were washed three times in HBSS at 4 C, suspended in 50 glycerol PBS and mounted on glass slides to be studied by epi illumination with a Zeiss Universal microscope fitted with an HBO 50 mercury arc lamp. This microscope was equipped with three different optical systems for the analysis of Trf and Adr For a direct inhibition assay, cells 0.5 x10⁶ were incubated with 100 µl of sterile Trf Adr or with Cer Adr conjugates containing 1 µg of Adr, or with complete medium at 37 C in 5 CO₂ air for 3 hours, following which they were washed twice in complete medium for 7 minutes per wash at 4 C, and centrifuged at 400g. For a competitive inhibition assay, cells 0.5 x 10⁶ were incubated with or without 100 µl of Trf 1mg ml at 4 C for 30 minutes, followed by incubation with Trf Adr, Cer Adr or PBS at 4 C for 30 minutes. They were then washed twice at 4 C and further incubated at 37 C for 2 hours. For the quantification of cellular proliferation, 300 µl of complete medium was added to the washed cell pellet, and the cells were resuspended and distributed in triplicate as 100 µl aliquots in flat bottom microtiter plates Flow Laboratories , each well of which was pre loaded with 100 µl of complete medium and 25 µl of 2 µCi of ³H thymidine specific activity, 2 Ci mmole, Radiochemical Center, Amersham, Bucks, England . Plates were then incubated at 37 C in 5 CO₂ air for 16 hours, and the cells were harvested on glass fiber filters in a MASH II multiple harvester Microbiological Associates, Walkersville, Md., USA . The amount of ³H thymidine incorporated into DNA was measured in a LKB 1216 Rackbeta II liquid scintillation counter and expressed as counts per minute cpm . Quantitative measures of the viability and number of cells were also done in all experiments. In preparing the conjugates, it was found that native Trf 1 ml of 5mg ml in PBS consistently emerged from a column of Sepharose CL 6B between fractions 22 and 30, peaking at fraction 26 Fig. 1a . However, when Trf, which had been carried through the conjugation procedure in the absence of Adr, was chromatographed on the same column, a more complex pattern was obtained Fig. 1b . The macromolecular peak A in Fig. 1b was precipitated by anti Trf antibody in Ouchterlony and immunoelectrophoresis gels, as did the samples which emerged at the same place as native Trf, i.e., between fraction numbers 20 26 B in Fig. 1b , but the late appearing peak C in Fig. 1b was not precipitated by anti Trf in gels. It was therefore considered that A was Trf aggregates, B was chromatographically and antigenically native Trf and C was Trf fragments. When Trf Adr conjugates were passed through the column, the OD₂₈₀ tracing was similar to the controls, but reading at OD₄₉₅ revealed Adr in both peaks A and B Fig. 1c , whereas nothing was detected in OD₄₉₅ in the absence of Adr. Accordingly, peak B was used as Trf Adr conjugate in the following experiments. It should be noted that Adr has a molecular weight of 579, and that it does not chromatograph within the molecular weight range of Sepharose CL 6B. Trf, Adr and Trf Adr conjugates were investigated for their ability to be bound by plasma membrane receptors and to intercalate with nuclear DNA. This was done by using two different manipulations the first being the incubation of Trf receptor positive cells with the above reagents for 20 minutes at 4 C, and the second being incubation of cells with the same reagents for 3 hours at 37 C. For these experiments, Daudi and HL 60 cells were used, since it has previously been reported that their plasma membranes have receptors for Trf, and PBM were used as Trf receptor negative cells. When HL 60 or Daudi cells were incubated with Trf which had been carried through the conjugation and chromatography in the absence of Adr, or with Trf Adr conjugates for 20 minutes at 4 C, a uniformly speckled pattern of fluorescence could be identified on their plasma membranes following incubation with FITC labelled antibodies to human Trf. In contrast, only 8 of PBM were found to find Trf or Trf Adr conjugates, and none of the PBM, HL 60 or Daudi cells reacted with FITC anti Trf after being incubated with Adr alone Table 1 . However, incubation of PBM, HL 60 or Daudi cells with free Adr for 20 minutes at 4 C resulted in a red fluorescence of their nuclei, a result which was not obtained by incubation of any of the target cells with Trf or Trf Adr conjugates for 20 minutes at 4 C. When these experiments were repeated with the use of the same cells and the same reagents, but with the incubation time changed to 3 hours and the temperature changed to 37 C, the results were different. In the first instance, the pattern of immunofluorescence following incubation of HL 60 or Daudi cells with Trf or Trf Adr conjugates was no longer homogeneous, but appeared to be clustered into islands of fluorescent patches on plasma membranes. The most striking difference found with these changed conditions of time and temperature for incubation was that obtained with the Trf Adr conjugates, for Adr could now be identified in the nucleus. It is thought that Adr acts by inserting itself between base pairs of DNA, resulting in an inhibition of DNA synthesis and eventual cell death, so the inhibition of ³H thymidine uptake as well as trypan blue exclusion were chosen as measures of cellular proliferation and viability, respectively. Incubation of Trf Adr conjugates for 3 hours at 37 C with Daudi and HL 60 cells followed by two washes and a 16 hour culture period in tritiated thymidine had the striking effect of diminishing both proliferation and viability, whereas minimal effects were observed for both thymidine incorporation and viability when PBM were tested under the same conditions Table 2 . The Trf control manifested moderate suppresion of Daudi and HL 60 cells and augmentation of PBM proliferation, while Trf Adr conjugates consistently recorded more than 90 suppression of both cell lines in thirty experiments. Regarding the death of PBM, it should be pointed out that, unlike Daudi and HL 60, very few PBM were found to contain Adr in their nuclei, indicating that dead cells resulted as a consequence of manipulation In order to provide additional evidence for the specific inhibition of cellular proliferation by Trf Adr conjugates, Cer Adr conjugates were used as a protein control for Trf. The choice of Cer was predicated by the observation that other proteins such as human albumin, Gc and alpha fetal protein are immunologically cross reactive with unfolded Trf but not with Cer. Although Cer Adr conjugates were found to kill target cells Trf Adr conjugates were serially diluted to test the end point of their ability to inhibit the uptake of ³H thymidine. The results of these experiments showed that the proliferation of HL 60 cells was directly associated with the amount of Trf Adr conjugate used in the initial 3 hour preincubation step of the assay Figure 3 . Conjugate binding was rapid and achieved a plateau at 30 minutes preincubation Figure 4 , although the Using techniques similar to those described in relation to Table 2 the effect of Trf Adr on ³H thymidine uptake by leukemic cells taken from six different patients suffering variously from acute myelocytic leukemia AML or from acute lymphatic leukemia ALL were studied. The results are set out in Table 4. Significant inhibition was noted in each case. Experiments were carried out to test the ability to bind transferrin of cells taken from a number of healthy people as well as from a number of patients with a lymphoma or a myeloma or suffering from AML, ALL, chronic myelocytic leukemia CML , or chronic lymphatic leukemia CML . Some of these patients were in remission R whilst others were not in remission NR . In these experiments the technique used was generally as described above in relation to Table 1. The results are summarised in Table 5. Table 6 summarises the effects on a number of patients of treatment with 1 mg. Trf Adr administered by the intravenous route in the form of conjugate in physiological saline. Patients Nos. 1, 4 and 5 were the same patients as are referred to in Table 4. The effects of this dosage on the counts of both blasts and polymorphonucleated neutrophiles PMN are listed.
