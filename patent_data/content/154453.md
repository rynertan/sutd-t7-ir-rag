# THERMOPLASTIC ELASTOMER COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A process for producing a thermoplastic elastomer comprising curing a blend of nitrile rubber and a thermoplas tic under dynamic curing conditions. The thermoplastic eomprises a copolymer of ethylene and an acrylic or methacrylic ester, e.g. ethylene ethyl acrylate, and the curing agent is a peroxy curing agent. The compositions are cured by mixing at a temperature above the activation temperature of the curing agent and above the melting point of the thermoplastic copolymer.
