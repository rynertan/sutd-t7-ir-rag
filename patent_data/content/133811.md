# Method for facing wooden door frames.

## Abstract
Wooden jambs and lintels for door openings are faced with profiled steel sections presented in the correct attitude and position without requiring the use of spacer plates by screws which threadedly engage both the profiled sections and the jambs. A profile section presented in the correct attitude and position to the jamb is threadedly engaged by a screw which passes through an aperture in the profiled section and is screwed through the section until it meets the jamb. The screw is then screwed further through the section and into the jamb until the screw head engages the section. The threaded engagement of the screw with the profiled section and the jamb retains the correct spacing and attitude of the section with respect to the jamb. The screw may threadedly engage the wall of the aperture in the section or an extension thereof which may be an integral deep drawn extension or a threaded nut secured to the section. The screws are advantageously self tapping with the smallest diameter of the aperture or its extension corresponding to the root diameter of the screw.
