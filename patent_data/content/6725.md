## Description
Electrical Connector for conncting a flat cable to a substrate. This invention relates to an electrical connector, and particularly an electrical connector for use in entablishing electrical connections between the conductons of a flat rnulti conductor electrical cable and conductors carried by a substrate. Such a connector is disclosed in French PatentApplication No. 73.14613, publication No. 2241888, which discloses a connector comprising a single member stamped and formed from sheet metal and having an elongate body portion, a plurality of rosilient contact fingers arranged in a row eztending lengthwise of the body portion, all the fingers extending in the same direction and having their longitudinal axes extending transversely of the row direction, and mounting means formed at each end of the body portion and adapted and arranged to secure the connector to a substrate with the fingers extending towards and engaging conductors carried by the substrate. For use of this known connector, exposed end portions of the conductors ot a flat multi conductor cable comprising a plurality of parallel conductors carried by a sheet of insulating material, are clamped between he fingers and conductors on the surface of a substrate, for example a printed circuit hoard, the fingers thus serving to urge the cable conductors into engagenent with the substrate conductors respectively, to provide the roquired connections. With this known connector the fingers are arranged to point away from the edge of the substrate at which the connector is to be mounted, that is towards the cable to be connected to the substrate, and thus the connector can be mounted only at an edge of a substrate with the cable and connector being simultaneously applied to the substrate with the nounting means of the connector entering slots open to the edge of the substrate.This is because if the connector is first mounted onto the substrate without the cable, then the end of cable cannot subsequently be inserted between the fingers and the substrate since the free ends of the fingers are directed towards the cable and are in engagement with the substrate. This known connector thus has the disadvantages that as disclosed it can be used only at an edge of a substrate, and must be assembled to a substrate simultaneously with a cable, and must also be removed from the substrate en the cable is to be removed. U.S. Patent Spccification No. 3629787 discloses an electrical connector which serves the same purpose as the connector discussed above, and which comprises a housing of insulating manorial adapted to be secured to an end o a substrate having conductors on a surface thereof, the housing containing a contact structure stamped and formed from sheet metal and comprising a plurality of resilient fingers extending from one edge of a body portion, the fingers being reversely bent to uncer lie the body portion.In use, the housing is secured to the substrate with c posed end portions of the conductors of a cable as described above positioned between the conductors on the substrate and the fingers such that the fince rs are compressed and serve to urcje the cable conductor into engagement with the substrate conductors to ro ido t o. rrquircd connections. This known connector has the disadvantarjes that it consists of a plurality of different parts which must be assembled toycther, and that no provision is made for zero force insertion of a cable end betwec n the fingers and the substrate if the connector is mounted on the substrate prior to insertion of the cable end. According to this invention there is provided an electrical connector for use in establishing electrical connections between the conductors of a flat multiconductor electrical cable and conductors carried by a substrate, the connector comprising a single member stamped and formed frora Iieet metal and having an elongate body portion, a plurality of resilient contact fingers arranged in a row extending lengthwise of the body portion, all the fingers extending in the saone direction and having their longitudinal axes extending transversely of the row direction, and mounting means formed at each end of the body portion and adapted and arranged to secure the connector to a substrate with the fingers extending towards and engaging conductors carried by the substrate, characterised in that the fingers extend from one longitudinal edge of the body portion and are reversely bent to underlie the body portion, and in that the mounting means comprises a plurality of tabs adapted to pass through holes in the substrate and thereafter to be bent to engage the surface of the substrate remote from the surface engaged by the fingers. The connector of this invention has the advantages that it is cheap and sizzle to manufacture, and it can easily be mounted on a substrate at any required position not needing to be at an edge of the substrate. Further, the connector of this invention can easily be adapted for zero force insertion of a cable end between the fingers and a substrate on which the connector is mounted, and the connector does not hava to be disassembled in any r when the cable Is to be removed. This invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an electrical connector according to this invention in use in connecting the conductors of a flat multi conductor electrical cable to respective conductors on a substrate Figure 2 is a section on the line II II in Figure 1 but with the cable removed Figures 3 mld 4 are views similar to Figure 2 but showing two stages in the introductien of a cable to be connected to the substrate Figure 5 is a view similar to Figure 2 but of a modified connector according to this invention Figure 6 is an explodod perspective view of another electrical connector according to this invention for use in an assembly for connecting the conductors of a flat multi conductor electrical cable to respective posts upstanding from a substrate Figure 7 is a perspective view of the assembly ofFigure 6 in the assembled state Figure 8 is a view similar to Figure 2 but showing the connector in an assembly connecting the conductors of the cable to conductors on the surface of the substrate remote from the connector Figure 9 is a view similar to Figure 8 but showing a modified connector according to this invention, and with the cable removed from the assembly Figure 10 is a view in the direction of the arrows X X in Figure 9 Figure 11 is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing another modified forra of connector according to this invention Figure 12 is a section on the line XII XII in Figure 11 but with the cable removed and Figure 13 is a view in the direction of the arrows XIII XIII in Figure 12. The same reference numerals have been used for corresponding inters throughout the drawings. The connector 1 shotm in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a single member stamped and formed from sheet metal and having an elongate body portion 2 formed with a longitudinally extending strengthening embossment 3.A plurality of resilient contact fingers 4 e tend from one longitudinal edge 5 of the body portion 2, the fingers 4 being in a row extending lengthwise of the body portion 2 with all the fingers 4 cxtendinc, in the sarge direction and having their longitudinal ares extending transversely of the row direction. Each finger 4 is reversely bent to underlie the body portion 2, as clearly shown in Figure 2. Each end of the body portion 2 is formed with mounting means in the form of a flange 6 extending from the end of the body portion 2 and to the same side of the body portion 2 as the fingers 4, the free edge of the flange 6 remote from the body portion 2 being formed with two tabs 7. Figure 1 shows the connector 1 in use in establishing connections between the conductors 100 of a flat multi conductor electrical cable 101 in which the conductors 100 are encased in a sheet of insulating material 102, and conductors 200 on a substrate 201 such as a printed circuit board. The connector 1 is mounted on the substrate 201 by the tabs 7 being passed through respective holes in tile substrate 201 and then being bent to engage tile surface of t ie substrate 201 remote frori tlle surface carrying tlie conductors 200, as shown in Figure 2, the free edges of the flange. G encjagIng tile substrate 201. T fln the connector 1 i. so mounted the fingers 4 resiliently engage rospective conductors 200 on the substrate 201, as shown in Figure 2. The free end of cach finger 4 is bent back towards the body portion 2 to present a rounded surface 8 to the substrate 201, and is then bent again to provide a short tail portion 9 which, whn the connector 1 is mounted on the substrate 201, extends substantially parallel to and spaced from talc surface of the substrate 201. Referring now to FigurCr 3 and 4 also, to connect the conductors 100 of the cable 101 to the conductors 200 on the substrate 201, the insulation 102 is removed from one side of the cable over an end portion 103 thereof, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, to expose the conductors 100. End portions 10 of the flanges G adjacent the free ends of the fingers 1 are bent inwardly towards each other, and serve as pivot joints for a tool 300 such as a sheet of metal, which is inserted under the tail portions 9 of the fingers 4 and over the pivot points 10 as shown in Figure 3.Pressure on the outer end of the tool 300 towards the substrate 201 causes the tool 300 to lift the fingers 4 out of engagement with the conductors 200 on the substrate 201, as shown in Figure 4, whereby the treated end portion 103 of the cable 101 can be inserted between the fingers 4 and the conductors 200, with the exposed conductors 100 of the cable 101 facing and respectively aligned with the conductors 200.The tool 300 is then removed, and tiio fingers 4 resiliently engage the still insulated side of the end portion 103 of the cable 101 and urge the conductors 100 of the cable 101 into electrical contact with respective ones of the conductors 200 on the substrate 201. Use of the tool 300 in often not essential since the figures 4 and accodiated conductors 200 on the substrate 201 together define a tapering insertion mouth for the cable and portion 103 which fan therfere be just pusbed in batween the Fingers 4 and conductors 200, moving the figures 4 as necessary during such inscrtion. Portions of the flanges 6 of the connector at the ends of the flanges 6 adjacent the roots of the fingers 4 are bent first inwardly towards each other and then bent again to extend away from the substrate 201 to provide hoek portions 11 facing the fingers 4. The cable 101 has two boles 104 Figure 1 formed therein, the holes 104 being positioned to receive the hook portions 11 of the connector 1 when the cable in inserted between the figuren 4 and the substrate 201, as shewn in Figure 1, therely to restrain the cable 101 from being pulled from the connector 1. Reforring now to Figure 5, the connector 1 here shown in similar to that shown in Figures 1 to 4, the only difference being that the finger. 4 are overall longer, and arn such that the tail portion 9 of each finger 4 is positioned to lirit the possible deflection of the finger 4 towards the body portion 2 to an extent ensuring that the finger cannot he overstressed sucil that the resiliency properties thereof are damaged. Referring now to Figures 6 and 7, the connector 1 here shown is for use in connecting the conductors 100 of the cable 101 to conductors in the form of a row of upstanding square cross section posts 202 carried by the substrate 201. The connector 1 is substantially the samme as that shown in Figures 1 to 4, the essential differences being that the tabs 7 are formed on an edge rather than the end of the flanges 6 such that when the commegtor 1 is secured to the substrate 201 the fingers 4 extend towards the substrate 201 with their contact surfaces 8 cach in engagenent with a side of a respective post 202. Further, the hoo portions 11 are formed in the ends o 1 the flanges 6 remote from the body portion 2, and the cable 101 is secured to the connector 1 by means of a securing frame 400 comprising two spaced parallel bars 401 and 402 joined by two cross bars 403.End portions of the bars 401 and 402 e tend beyond the cross bars 403, and the end portions 404 of the bar 402 are bent such that they can be engaged in the holes 104 in the cable 101, as shown inFigure 7. Een the frame 400 is mounted on the cable 101, and the end portion 103 of the cable 101 is then inserted between the fingers 4 and the posts 202 to Cs tab lish electrical connections between the conductors 100 of the cable 101 and the posts 202 as required, the end portions 405 of the bar 401 are engaged under the hoo portions 11 of the connector such that the frame 400 then serves to secure the cable 101 to the connector 1, as shown in Figure 7. The connector 1 shown in Figure 8 is the same as that shosm in Figures 1 to 4 save for a difference in the shape of the strengthening embossment 3. however, the connector 1 is shown mounted oil the side of the substrate 201 remote from the conductors 200 carried by the substrate 201. In this assembly connections between the conductors 200 on the substrate and the conductors 100 of the cable 101 are established by way of L shaped contact meribers 500 each having one limb extending across the surface of the substrate 201 on which the connector 1 is mounted, and the other limb extending through a hole in the substrate 201 and connected as by solder to a respective conductor 200.The fingers 4 of the connector 1 serve to urge the conductors 100 of the cable 101 into engagement with respective ones of the contact members 500 whereby the required connections are established. Referring now to Figures 9 and 10, the connector 1 here shown is similar to that shozfim in the Figure 8 assembly, save that the strain relief hook portions 11 are omitted, and the fingers 4 are of such a length to extend beyend the body portion 2 so as to be accessible to the hand of a user of the connector. Further, as shown inFigure 10, the frce ends of the fingers 4 are joined by a integrally formed cross member 12. With the connector the fingers 4 can be lifted out of engagement with the substrate 201 for insertion of the cable 1 1 without the use of a tool e.g. 300 in Figures 3 and 4 simply by manual action on the cross member 12. Referring nor to Figures ii, 12 and 13, the connector here shown is similar to that shown in Figures 1 to 4 cave that the hoof portions. 11 are omitted, and the finger 4 are of such a length to attend beyond the bo .y portion 2 of the connector 1.The connector 1 also includes a crossemember 12 similat to that shown inFigure 9 and 10, the difference being that this crossmember is joinccO to the frec 4, ends of only the end fingers 4, which end fingers 4 are bent, as shown in Figure 12, such tiiat the orossemember 12 engages under the free ends of the shown fingers 4, as clearly siloszm inFigure 13. With is connector 1 the fingers 4 can be lifted out of anraemcnt with the substrate 201 by manual action on the cross member 12, for inscrtion of a cable between the fingers 4 and the substrate 201.
