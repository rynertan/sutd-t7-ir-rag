Fiorinski, Zh Org. thin, 4 5 , 774 1968 . Organic diamines of the above formula include, for example, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine, 4,4 diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane, benzidine, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether, 1,5 diaminonaphthalene, 3,3 diaminodiphenyl ether, 1,5 diaminonaphthalene, 3,3 dimenthylbenzidine, 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine, 2,4 bis ss amino t butyl toluene, bis p ss amino t butylphenyl ether, bis p ss methyl oaminopentyl benzene, 1,3 diamino 4 isopropylbenzene, 1,2 bis 3 aminopropoxy ethane, m xylylenediamine, p xylylenediamine, 2,4 diaminotoluene, 2,6 diaminotoluene, bis 4 aminocyclohexyl methane, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 4,4 dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 2,11 dodecanediamine, 2,2 dimethylopropylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, 3 methoxyhexamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylhexamethylenediamine, 2,5 dimethylheptamethylenediamine, 3 methylheptamethylenediamine, 5 methylnonamethylenedediamine, 1,4 cyclohexanediamine, 1,12 octadecanediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl sulfide,N methyl bis 3 aminopropyl amine, hexamethylenediame, heptamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, bis 3 aminopropyl tetramethyldisiloxane, bis aminobutyl tetramethyldisiloxane, and the like.

Al tern atively, the polyetherimides can be prepared by melt polymerization of any of the above dianhydrides with any of the above diamine compounds while heating the mixture of the ingredients at elevated temperatures with concurrent intermixing. Generally, melt polymerization texperatures between about 200 to OO C. and preferably 230 to 300 C. can be employed.The conditions of the reaction and the proportions of ingredients can be varied widely depending on the desired molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity, and solvent resistance. In general, equinolar amounts of diamine and dianhydride are employed for high molecular weight polyetherimides, however, in certain instances, a slight molar excess about I to 5 mol percent of diamine can be employed resulting in the production of polyetherimides having terminal amine groups. Generally., useful polyetherimides have an intrinsic viscosity greater than 0.2 deciliters per gram, preferably 0.35 to 0.60, or 0.7 deciliters per gram or even higher when measured in m cresol at 25 C. included among the many methods of making the polyetherimides are those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. Heath et al, 3,847,867, Williams 3,847,869, Takehoshi et al, 3 850,895, White 3,852,242 and 3,855,178, etc. These disclosures are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference for the purpose of teaching, by way of illustration, general and specific methods for preparing polyetherimides suitable for the blends of this invention. Polyamides may be obtained by polymerizing a monoaminomonocarboxylic acid or an internal lactam thereof having at least two carbon atoms between the amino and carboxylic acid groups or by polymerizing substantially equimolar proportions of a diamine which contains at least two carbon atons between the amino groups and a dicarboxylic acid or by polymerizing a monoaminocarboxylic acid or an internal lactam thereof as defined above together with substantially equinolecular proportions of a diamine and a dicarboxylic acid. The dicarboxylic acid may be used in the form of a functional derivative thereof, for example, an ester. The term substantially equimolecular proportions of the diamine and of the dicarboxylic acid is used to comprehend both strict equimolecular proportions and the slight departures therefrom which are involved in conventional techniques for stablizing the viscosity of the resultant polyamides. As examples of the rnonoaminomonocarboxylic acids or lactams thereof, there may be mentioned those compounds containing from 2 to 16 carbon atoms between the amino and carboxylic acid groups, the carbon atoms forming a ring with the CD Mi group in the case of a lactam. As particular examples of aminocarboxylic acids and lactams there may be mentioned e aminocaproic acid, butyrolactas, pivalolactam, caprolactam, capryl lactam, enantholactam, undecanolactaw, dodecanolactam and 3 and 4 amino benzoic acids. Examples of suitable diamines are diamines of the general formula H2N CH2 nNH2 wherein n is an integer of froi 2 to 16, such as trimethylenediamine, tetramethylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, dodecamethylenediamine, hexadecamethylenediamine, and especially hexamethylenediamine. C alkylated diamines, e.g., 2,2 dimethylpentamethylenediamine and 2,2,4 and 2,4,4 trimethylhexamethylenediamine are further examples.Other diamines which may be mentioned as examples are aromatic diamines, e.g., p phenylenediamine, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether and 4,4 diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4 diaminodiphenyl ether and 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethane and cycloaliphatic diarnines, for example, diarninodicyclohexylmethane. The dicarboxylic acids may be aromatic, for example, isophthalic and terephthalic acids. Preferred dicarboxylic acids are of the formula HOOC Y COOH wherein Y represents a divalent aliphatic radical containing at least two carbon atoms, and examples of such acids are sebacic acid, octadecanedjoic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, undecanedioic acid, glutaric acid, pimelic acid, and especially adipic acid. Oxalic acid is also a preferred acid. As was mentioned previously, the blends of the present invention comprise from about 40 to 80 wt. preferably from 40 to 60 wt. of a polyetherimide and the remainder one or more polyamides. Such blends generally have a tensile strength which is greater than the tensile strength of polyetherimide polyamide blends which do not contain from 40 to aov polyetherimide, while still retaining a good coa bLnation of other physical properties such as heat distortion characteristics and impact strength. In addition, the blends of the invention may have a flexural strength which is greater than that of other polyetherimide polyamide blends outside the scope of the invention.Consequently, by controlling the proportions of the polyetherimide and polycarbonate relative to each other within the above range, it was surprisingly found that blends having properties which are improved over those of blends outside the range as well as over the polyetherimide or polyamide components alone can be achieved. Thus, the blends of the invention provide materials which have certain properties approaching those of the polyetherimide component alone while cohtaining a significant proportion of the generally presently less expensive polyamide relative to the polyetherimide. Furthermore, blends within the composition range of the present invention have an appearance which suggests that the blends are of one phase and therefore compatible. The unique characteristics of the blends of the present invention are illustrated in the drawings in which Figure 1 is a plot of unnotched impact strength versus polyetherimide content for blends of a polyetherimide and a polyamide, Figure 2 is a plot of heat distortion temperture versus polyetherimide content for blends of a polyetherimide and a polyamide, Figure 3 is a plot of ultimate flexural strength versus polyetberi nide content for blends of a polyetherimide and a polyamide, Figure 4 is a plot of flexural modulus versus polyetherimide concentration for blends of a polyetherimide and a polyamide, and Figure 5 is a plot of tensile strength versus polyetherimide concentration for blends of a polyetherimide and a polyamide. It is contemplated that the polyetherimide polyamide blends of the present invention may also include other additive materials such as fillers, stabilizers, plasticizers, flexibilizers, surfactant agents, pigments, dyes, reinforcements, flame retardants and diluents in conventional amounts. It is also contemplated that the blends of the invention may include two or more polyetherimides with one or more polyamides or two or more polyamides in combination with one or more polyetherimides. Hethods for forming polyetherimide polyamide blends may vary considerably. Prior art blending techniques are generally satisfactory. A preferred method comprises blending the polymers and additives such as reinforcements in powder, granular or filamentous form, extruding the blend, and chopping the extrudate into pellets suitable for molding by means conventionally used to mold normally solid thermoplastic compositions. The particular polyetherimide polyamide blends of the present invention have application in a wide variety of physical shapes and forms, including the use as films, molding compounds, coatings, etc. When used as films or when made into molded products, these blends, including laminated products prepared therefrom, not only possess good physical properties at room temperature but they retain their strength and excelient response to workloading at elevated temperatures for long periods of time. Films formed from the blends of this invention may be used in application where films have been used previously.Thus, the blends of the present invention can be used in automobile and aviation applications for decorative and protective purposes, and as high temperature electrical insulation for motor slot liners, transformers, dielectric capacitors, cable and coil wrappings form wound coil insulation for motors , and for containers and container linings. The blends can also be used in laminated structures where films or solutions of the blend are applied to various heat resistant or other type of materials such as asbestos, mica, glass fiber and the like, the sheets superimposed one upon the other, and thereafter subjecting the sheets to elevated temperatures and pressures to effect flow and cure of the resinous binder to yield cohesive laminated structures. Films made from the subject polyetherimide polyamide blends can also serve in printed circuit applications. Alternatively, solutions of the blends herein described can be coated on electrical conductors such as copper, aluminum, and the like and thereafter the coated conductor can be heated at elevared temperatures to remove the solvent and to form a continuous coating of the resinous composition thereon. If desired, an additional overcoat may be applied to such insulated conductors including the use of polymeric coatings, such as polyamides, polyesters, silicones, polyvinylforal resins, epoxy resins, polyimides, polytetrafluorethylene, etc. The use of the blends of the present invention as overcoats on other types of insulation is not precluded. Other applications which are contemplated for these blends include their use as tinders for asbestos fibers, carbon fibers, and other fibrous materials in making brake linings. In addition, molding compositions and molded articles may be formed from the polymeric blends cf the in enticn such as by incorporating such fillers as asbestos, glass fibers, talc, quartz, powder, finely divided carbon, silica, and the like into the blends prior to molding.Shaped articles may be formed under heat, or under heat and pressure, in accordance with practices well known in the art. The following examples illustrate specific polyetherimide polyamide blends in accordance with the present invention. It should be understood that the examples are given for the purpose of illustration and do not limit the invention. In the exampes, all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Example A series of polyetherimide nylon 6 6 blends, some according to the invention and some outside the invention, were prepared, the blends molded into test specimens and the specimens tested for various physical properties. The polyetherimide of the blends was prepared from the reaction product of essentially equimolar amounts of 2,2 bis 4 3,4 dicarboxy phenoxy phenyl propane dianhydride and m phenylene diamine produced at elevated temperature of about 250 to about 3CCC. and under a nitrogen atmcsphere. The polymer was extruded at about 300 C. to form a strand and mechanically chopped into pellets. A test specimen of the poiyetherimide was injection molded from the pellets at a temperature of about 68S 700 F. The physical properties of the polyetherimide are set forth in the first line of the following Table I. The polyamide used in preparing the blends was a general purpose nylon 6 6 sold under the tradename Vydyne 21x by Monsanto Chemical Co. This polyamide alone has the properties set forth at the bottom of Table I. About 90 parts of the above polyetherimide were mixed with about 10 parts of the polyamide.The mixture of the two polymers was then extruded in a Werner Pfleiderer extruder having a temperature profile varying from about 226 to 3260C and a die temperature of about 3160C. The resulting extrudate was comminuted into pellets and the pellets injection molded into test specilens in a Sattenfield molding machine at a temperature of about 265C to 321iC. The impact strength of these specimens were measured according to the unnotched and notchedIzod impact test and the results are set forth in the following Table I. The heat distortion temperature, flexural properties, tensile properties and appearance of the blend were also determined and are given in Table I. The above procedure for preparing the blend vas then repeated to produce test specimens of three additional blends having varying amounts of polyetherimide relative to the polyamide. The results of the unnotched and notched Izod impact test, as well as the heat distortion temperature, flexural properties, tensile properties and appearance for these blends are also detailed in Table I.

From published data. In Figures 1 5, some of the data from Table I is plotted versus relative concentration of the components of the blends in solid lines. From Figure 1, a plot of the unnotched Izod impact strength versus polyetherimide concentration, it can be observed that small amounts of nylon result in significantly lower unnotched impact strength values. However, after this initial drop, the impact values remain relatively constant to the 50 50 blend level before another small decrease is observed.The notched Izod impact strength values are somewhat similar to the unnotched values. The notched impact strength of the blends decreased from pure polyetherimide to the 70 polyetherimide blend level and then remains fairly constant regardless of te blend ratio. FromFigure 2, it is apparent that the heat distortion temperature values decrease only slightly from 100 polyethermide to 70 concentrations of polyetherimide, but beyond this point the heat distortion temperature drops about 30 C. to 140 C. where it remains generally constant over the remainder of the blend compositions tested. The flexural properties are plotted in Figures 3 and 4. The flexural strength decreases very rapidly from the 1009 polyetherimide to 909 blend level and then increases slightly to a maximum occurring at about a 50 50 blend ratio as is shown in Figure 3 In Figure 4, the flexural modulus can be seen to decrease as nylon is initially added, then level out, and decrease again as the concentration of polyetherimide in the blends if reduced below about 50 . From Figure 5, the plot shows that the tensile failure strength decreases substantially at the 10 nylon blend level from the pure polyetherimide level but then the strength increases to a maximum at about the 50 50 blend level where it is only about 6 lower than the tensile failure strength of the pure polyetherimide. The substantial lovering of the tensile strength in the 90 polyetherimide blend may be due to the presence of a two phase system. From the above discussion, it can be observed that several of the measured properties of the blends reach a maximum relative to other blends of the total concentration range at the 50 50 blend level of polyetherimide to polyamide. Consequently, the concentration range about the 50 50 blend level, i.e., from about 40 to about 60 polyetherimide is presently preferred for the blends of the invention. Example II The basic procedure of Example I was repeated using a nylon 12 sold under the tradename L 2101 by Huls instead of nylon 6 6. This polyamide alone has the properties set forth at the bottom of Table II. In addition, the extruder temperature profile varied from about 320 to 326 C for the blends containing 10 and 30t polyetherimide and from about 315 to 332sC for the remainder of the blends. The die temperature used in preparing all the blends was about 321 C. As in Example I, test specimens of each blend were tested for notched and unnotched Izod impact strength as well as for heat distortion temperature, flexural properties and tensile properties. These results and the visual appearance of the various blends are set forth in TableII.

From published data. The data from Table II is also plotted in dotted lines in Figures I through 5 versus relative concentrations of the components of the blends. From Figure 1, a plot of unnotched impact strength values versus polyetherimide concentration, it is evident that the unnotched impact decrease from pure polyetherimide 26.5 ft lb in to the blend containing 70 polyetherimide content where the values start to increase and finally exhibit maximum at approximately 308 polyetherimide. In a similar ranner, the notched Izod impact strength values of the blends decrease very rapidly between 90 and 50 polyetherimide content and then remain fairly constant as the concentration of nylon increases further. The heat distortion temperature values, plotted inFigure 2, decrease rapidly from pure polyetherimide to the 50 50 blend level. Below 509 polyetherimide the heat distortion temperature values decrease only slightly as more nylon is included in the blends. This data suggest a phase inversion occurs around a 50 50 blend composition of the two components. The flexural strength, plotted in Figure 3, exhibits behavior similar to the unnotched Izod values where the values decrease as the polyetherimide concentration is lowered to the 90 level and then increase to a maximum at approximately a 50 50 blend ratio. The flexural modulus does not exhibit this same behavior but at the 50 50 blend ratio the curve does change slope as is shown in Figure 4. The curve formed by the tensile failure strength inFigure 5 is very similar to both the flexural strength andIzod curves. A maximum in the tensile failure strength is found at about a 305 polvetherzmioe composition while the tensile failure elongation reaches its highest value at 31 . No tensile yield points are exhibited by any of these blends. It is contemplated that substitution of other polyetherimides and or other polyamides for the polyetherimide and or polyamides in the blends of the above examples may result in the formulation of polymer blends having similar characteristics. While the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments thereof, it will be understood that numerous modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without actually departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
