# CONNECTOR FOR ELECTRICALLY CONNECTING AN ELONGATE CONDUCTOR TO A TERMINATION POST

## Abstract
An electrical connector comprises a deformable contact member having a male end for acceptance of, for example, one or more lead wires and a deformable female end for acceptance of, for example, a box mount termination post. The connector further comprises a pre oriented recoverable sleeve surrounding the contact, whereupon heating, the sleeve recovers, releasably trapping the lead wires against the male end and converging the legs of the female end thereby releasably trapping the post within the contact member.
