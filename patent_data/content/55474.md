## Description
BIOCIDAL AGENTS FOR USE IN PLASTICS, POLYMERS AtED CFTrEIOSIC MATERIALS Background and Prior Art This invention relates to the protection of plastics, polymeric materials, and cellulosic materials against attack by microorganisms. Synthetic, film orming materials such as those used in the manufacture of plastic or polymeric ffl s, and various types of plastics or polymers, are known to be subject to attack by microorganisms. Such microorganisms include bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. The last mentioned are microorganisms found in soil which contain no chlorophyll. They are usually classified with the bacteria, but resemble both bacteria and fungi they are intermediate in size between fungi and bacteria Such microorganisms attack plastics and polymers and can cause damage or deterioration ranging from discoloration and staling to embrittlement or actual disintegration, depending on the type of plastic or polymer, and the environment in which it is situated. Severe damage can be produced to plastics or polymers which are utilized in certain environments, such as those with high humidity. Plastics and polymers are commonly used for instance, in underground construction, in pipes and conduits, cables, sheathing, insulation, etc.In such an environment, they are subject to severe deterioration by soil borne microoganisms. Similarly, plastics and polymers used in materials such as swimming pool liners, awnings, camping equipment, and other articles for outdoor use, and in upholstery, car tops, shoes, boots and clothing, in which they may be exposed to natural humidity and or sweat, possibly in combination with somewhat elevated temperatures, are subject to microbial deterioration. In addition to physical deterioration of plastics and polymers, microorganisms growing on the surface of such materials can cause discoloration and or staining thereof resulting in a shortening of the useful life of said materials for at least aesthetic purposes. Actinomycetes, in particular, growing on the surfaces of plastics and polymers can produce colored byproduct dyes which are soluble in the plasticizers used in such substances, and which migrate through the substance via the plasticizer, resulting in the phenomencn knossn as pink staining. In addition, surface growth of microroganisms on polymers may interfere with functional performance, for instance when used as lubricating surfaces. In order to prevent attack and deterioration or discoloration of polymeric or plastic materials by microorganisms, a number of compounds have been used as industrial biocdes. For use as a biocide in connection with plastics and polymers, a compound rust have the following properties effectiveness at low levels against many microoganisms compatibility with plasticizers and other chemicals used in the formulation of plastic and polymeric products lack of a disadvantageous color or odor resistance to leaching fran plastic or polymeric materials and particularly a thermal stability at temperatures over 3000F. 1480C. so that deterioration of the biocide does not occurduring the processing of plastics and polymers b mobility the ability to migrate through the plastic, polymer or plasticizer utilized therein, so as to be dis sipated therethrough and c .stability towards ultraviolet and other light radiation. Such properties are necessary for plastics and polymers which are cast, rolled, molded, extruded, or otherwise fabricated into a con tinuous form, for use in various ways such as raw materials for the manli facture of plastic or polymer articles or as plastic or polymeric coatings, as well as plastics and polymers which are knitted or woven into continuous fibers. Similarly, cellulosic materials, such as cotton and other fibers are subject to damage or deterioration by microorganisms industrial biocides have been used to protect such materials, and articles formed from them, from microbial deterioration. Properties such as stability toward ultraviolet light and heat are also required of biocides for such materials. Both the prevention of growth in the contact area, that is on the material itself, and inhibition of growth in a D. surrounding the contact area, are of Importance in order to prevent the spread of an actively growing organism. The biocide must possess a positive antimicrobial activity in a zone of inhibition surrounding the article otherwise, a compound which is effective as a biocide in the contact area itself would nevertheless not control heavy growth on the surface or on substances associated with or attached to the material.Such property is important, for instance, for fabrics in which a polymeric fiber, such as a polyester or polyamide, is laminated to a cotton or other cellulosic backing such as canvas Many of the industrial biocides currently used in connecticn with plastics, polymers and cellulosic fibers are organometallics. These compounds are effective in preventing microbial attack on such materials.However, such compounds may be suspect for reasons of toxicity or environmental effect and problems caused by their handling and are now less accepted in some of the industrial uses in which they have hitherto been employed. It has thus become desirable to find new, non metallic bio cides for use with such materials. Sumnary of the Invention In brief, this invention comprises a method of protecting a cellulosic, plastic or filmrforming polymeric composition, fabricated into a continuous form, comprising incorporating into such composition or form a microbiocidally effective amount of a compound having the formula EMI3.1 in which Y is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halogen R1 andR2 are independently hydrogen or methyl and n is 1 or 2. Additionally, this invention relates to such compositions containing or coated with a microbiocidally effective amount of such a compound. The term film forming is meant to refer to polymeric particles, whether present as dry particulate matter, or in liquid, dissolved, suspended, continuous, or any other form, particularly including the ultimate form for which such particles are designed. The term plastic Is similarly intended to be regarded as a broad term and is to be understood to include polymeric materials which can be cast, extruded, injection molded, or compression molded into a desired state. Certain polymers such as alkyd resins, polyester based urethanes, polyesters, and certain cellulosic polymers such as benzyl , methyl , hydroxyethyl , and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, are suscepti ble in and of themselves to attack by microorganisms. Other polymers such as polyethylene and polystyrene may become susceptible after degradation through prolonged weathering. Still other plastics and polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, are considered in and of themselves to be generally resistant to such attack.However, many substances utilized with polymers to produce polymeric or plastic products, for instance, flexible polyvinyl chloride sheeting, contain additives such as plastic cizers, stabilizers, fillers, lubricants, thickening agents or starch sizings for synthetic fibers, which are susceptible to attack by microorganisms. Thus, plastics or other materials formulated fran a polymer resistant to such attack but incorporating a substance such as a plasticizer, which is susceptible to such attack, are thereby rendered susceptible to deterioration, discoloration, and other damage fram microorganisms. Alternatively, microorganisms can grown on debris, lubricants, or other materials adhering to the surface of a non susceptible plastic or polymer. Metabolic products of such organisms may cause etching of the substrate material. The compounds which have been found to be biocides for use with cellulosic materials, plastics and polymers are those having the formulaEMI4.1 in which Y is hydrogen, C1 Cq alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halogen R1 andR2 are independently hydrogen or methyl and n is 1 or 2. Preferably the group Y is located para to the sulfonyl moiety. The term halogen includes chloro, bromo, iodo and fluoro, and preferably indicates chloro, bromo, or fluoro. The most preferred compound is that in which Y is p methyl. Other preferred compounds are those in which Y is p chloro, p fluoro, p methoxy or hydrogen.These compounds, except for those in which Y is alkoxy, are disclosed in U.S. Patens 3,159,532 and 3,159,666 of Heininger, et al., as part of a series of aryl suETonyl alkene nitriles. As shown in those patents, these compounds are effective microbiocides for use in agricultural environments, particularly as soil microbiocides, and showed activity in vitro against a number of fungi and bacteria. Also mentioned with respect to the p methyl compound is soap bacteriostatic and paint preservative activity. No mention is made in these patents of any utility with respect to plastics, polymers, or cellulosic fibers. The compounds in which Y is C1 C4 alkoxy are novel. For use as an agricultural biocide, compounds must possess a necessary short term, ephemeral activity, as agricultural biocides must not leave residues in either the soil or the plants which have been treated. The properties necessary for use as a plastic, polymer or cellulosic material biocide are different, however, from those required for effectiveness of an agricultural biocide. As pointed out above, particularly for use as plastics or polymer biocides, compounds must possess high thermal stability, ultraviolet radiation stability, and the ability to migrate through the plastic.Such properties are not neces sarily possessed by compounds which are soil fungicides, nor are such properties required of, or necessarily possessed by compounds which are used as biocides for soap and for preservation of paint The compounds to which the present invention relates have been found to possess surprisingly high thermal stability, with the p methyl compound being thermally stable at 2500C. They have been found to possess the necessary, unexpected ability to migrate through plastics, and the requisite, surprisingly high stability to ultraviolet radiation. The compounds which are known may be prepared according to any of several processes described in the literature, for instance in U.S. Patents 3,159,666 and 3,541,119. The novel alkoxy substituted compounds may be prepared by similar processes or by a method which comprises reacting an alkali metal preferably sodium salt of a sulfinic acid with 2 chloroacrylonitrile or an analog EMI6.1 This reaction is generally conducted in aqueous media in the presence of buffers such as sodium acetate and or boric acid, at approximately room temperature. The following is an example of the preparation of one of the novel compounds by such technique. EtAPrF 1 Preparation of 3 4 methoxyphenylsulfonyl acrylonitrile Compound 7 herein In a flask, 59.5 g. 0.31 mole sodium 4 methoxybenzenesulfin ate, 25.4 g. 0.31 mole sodium acetate.and 19.2 g. 0.31 mole boric acid were dissolved in a mixture of 150 ml. water and 275 ml. isopropyl alcohol. There was then added, with stirr ng, dropwise, 33.9 g. 31 m 0.39 mole 2 chloroacrylonitrile. The mixture was stirred for some time at room temperature. Water was then added and the mixture stirred for one hour. A precipitate formed, which was filtered, washed with water and ethanol, and dried. The structure of the compound, which had a melting point of 120 122 C., was confirmed by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy. Tests were performed on a number of compounds falling within the generic class defined by the formula given above. These compounds are described in Table 1. TABLE 1EMI7.1 Comtound.No. Yn 1 4 CH3 2 4 Cl 3 4 sec.C4Hg 4 4 F 5 H 6 2,5 C1 7 4 OCH3 To determine the suitability of the compounds as biocides for these materials, tests were performed as described below.A Thermal Stability Compound 1 was tested for thermal stability using a PerkiLn Elmer DSC 2 differential scanning calorimeter. Samples of solid compound weighing between 5 and 20 mg were sealed into stainless steel pans and heated at a rate of 5.0 C. min. from 40 C. to 2500C. Thermograms of the compound s physical state were plotted against change in temperature. All showed approximately the same properties Åa small endothermic transition occurring at about 750C. and melting at between about 125 1350C. Over the entire range tested, up to 250 C., there was no evidence of any unusual thermal instability.B. Microbial Resistance Screening Test plastics polymers Compound 1 was utilized in this test. A dry powdered blend of polyvinyl chloride was prepared by dry mixing of the following ingredients by weight 100 parts Dia 450 polyvinyl chloride resin DIanond Shamrock Chemical Corporation , 40 parts dioctyl phthalate plasticizer 3.50 parts Mark KCB caamiun barium zinc heat stabilizer lubricant, 1.50 parts Mark C organic phosphite heat stabilizer lubricant Mark chemicals available from Argus Chemical Division, Witco Chemical Co. , 0.25 parts stearic acid and 7.6 parts epoxidized soybean oil plasticizer stabilizer . This composition was then fluxed on hot rollers at 3200F. 1600C. until homogeneously blended.Then a sufficient quantity of solid Ccro pound 1 was added, to provide a composition containing 1.0 weight of this compound. The composition was further milled for ten minutes, at this temperature, then sleeted off as a film. Samples of the film thus prepared were submitted to 100 hours of exposure treatment, in a xenon arc type weatherometer weather simulating exposure test apparatus programmed for continuous light with 18 minutes of water spray every two hours. The exposure was conducted according to ASIM Standard G26 70. Prior to exposure, and after 100 hours of exposure, samples of the films containing the test compound were tested for antimicrobial effect by the following procedure The samples were placed on a nutrient agar inoculated with the test organism. Those samples inoculated with bacteria or actinomycetes were incubated for 24 hours at 370C., samples inoculated with fungi were incubated 14 days at 28 C. After the incuba tion period, the anti microbial activity was evaluated by measuring in millimeters the size of the clear zone of no growth around the sample, and rating the degree of growth or stain visually. The organisms utilized in the tests were BACTERIA Staphylococcus aureus Klebsiella pr.eumoniae Pseudomonas aeruuinosa Bacillus subtilus ACTINOMYCETES Stv. recticulum pink staining organism FUNGI A mixed fungal spore suspension of Aspergillus niger Aspergillus flavus Penicillium funiculosum Chaetomium globosum ATCC 6205 The results of these tests are shown in the following Table II.

Anti microbtal Screening Tests with Ultraviolet and Weather Exposure plastecs polymers Dry blends of polyvinyl chloride were prepared as in the previous tests with the exception that no epoxidized soybean oil was included.To one set of blends there was additionally added one part Mark 202A ber. zophenone ultraviolet light stabilizer. Thus, one set of blends contained an ultraviolet stabilizer, while the other set of blends was not stabilized against ultraviolet radiation. The compounds in Table I above were incorporated into ultravio let stabilized and unstabilized polymer blends at levels of 0.5 and 1.0 weight based on the polymer. The polymer was then milled into films for ten minutes at about 3200F. 160 C. using hot rollers. Films were then exposed in the weatherometer as in the previous test, for 100 and 300 hours of exposure. Unexposed film, and film which had been exposed to the weather stimulation for 100 and 300 hours, respectively, were tested for antimicrobial activity as follows a Samples of film which had been unexposed, exposed for 100 hours, and exposed for 300 hours were placed on samples of nutrient agar variously inoculated with bacteria, actinomycetes or fungi.The organisms were BACTERIA Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 gram positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352ACTINOMYCETESStv. reticulum ATCC 25607 pink staining organism FUNGI a mixed fungal spore sus suspension of Aspergillus niger ATCC 9642Aspergillus flavus ATCC 9643Penicillium funiculosum ATCC 9644Chaetomium globosum ATCC 6205The samples inoculated with bacteria or actinomycetes were incubated for 24 hours at 370C. those containing fungi were incubated for 14 days at 280C. After incubation, activity was evaluated by measuring the size of a clear zone of no growth i.e., zone of inhibition around each sample and visually rating the degree of fungi growth or stain on the sample. b A second series of fungicidal tests was conducted using similar samples placed on agar containing non nutrent mineral salts and inoculated with a mixed fungal spore suspension of Aspergillus niger,ATCC 9642, Penicillin fjniculosum, ATCC 9644, Chaetomium globosum, ATC 6205, Aureobasidium pullulans, ATCC 9348, and Trichoderma sp., ATCC 9645.The samples were incubated for 21 days at 280C. ASTM Standard method G.21 75 . Antiuungal activity was evaluated by visually rating the degree of fungal growth on the samples. The results of these tests are contained in the following TableIII. The samples were also visually examined for coloration, prior to exposure and after 100 hours of exposure. The results are contained in the following Table IV.

Dark Thus, formulations including Compounds 1 and 2 were highly stable toward ultraviolet radiation, as demonstrated by the fact that films containing these compounds did not become colored after exposure to ultraviolet light for 100 hours. With respect to Compound 1, stability towards such radiation existed even in the absence of an ultraviolet stabilizer in the formulation. Such stability towards ultraviolet radiation would not have been expected from the structure of these compounds. All the compounds contain an activated double bond, which would be expected to be oxidized in the presence of ultraviolet light and air.D Long term Exposure Test Compound 1 was utilized in this test. A dry powdered blend of polyvinyl chloride was prepared by dry mixing of the following ingredients by weight 100 parts Diamond Shamrock 1150 polyvinyl chloride resin, 40 parts dioctyl phthalate plasticizer, 3.50 parts Mark KCB barium cadmium zinc heat stabilizer lubricant, 1.5 parts Mark C organic phosphine heat stabilizer lubricant, 1.0 part Mark 202A benzophenone ultraviolet stabilizer, 0.25 parts stearic acid and 7.6 parts epoxidized soybean oil plasticizer stabilizer . Compound 1 was added to samples of this blend in amounts so as to provide compositions containing 0.065, 0.25 and 1.0 by weight of this compound.The compositions were further mixed for ten minutes, then milled into a film on hot rollers at 3200F. 1600C. . Samples of the films thus produced were placed out of doors at a location in Puerto Rico and exposed to the weather for 8 12 months, continuously. Visual evaluations of microbial growth on the surface of the films were made using a scale of from 0 to 5, with 0 representing no growth visible to the naked eye and 5 representing complete coverage Results of these observations were as follows wt Compound 1 8 months 12 mcnths O control 4 5 0.065 1 4 0.25 0 4 1.0 0 0E. Soil burial test cotton fibers A solution of compound 1 in acetone was prepared, at a concentration of 0.62 weight . The solution was applied to cotton twill fabric the compound was applied at 0.5 by weight, based on the fabric sample.The treated fabric was placed horizontally on a 4 inch bed of compacted soil, covered with a l inch layer of loosely packed soil and placed in a humidity charifber maintained at 880F. 31.1 C. and 90 relative humidity. After 14 days, the sample was recovered and evaluated visually for deterioration. The fabric was observed to be in excellent condition with no evidence of any deterioration or microbial growth.F. Anti microbial Screening Test Samples of cotton twill coated with compound 1 as in test E were submitted to 24 hours of exposure treatment in an enclosed single carbon arc fadeometer. Prior to exposure, the samples were tested for anti bacterial and anti fungal effect by the procedure described above in test B . The results of these tests are shown in the following TableV.

Several commercial agricultural and soil fungicides were tested by the above described methods to ascertain whether any correlation could be determined between activity as a soil fungicide and activity as a biocide for plastics or polymers The tests appeared to demcnstrate a lack of any such correlation.In particular Cycloheximide, 3 2 3,5 dimethyl 2 oxacyclohexyl 2 hydroxy ethyl glutaramide, tested as in B above, at 0.5 wt. , provided essentially no control of the test orsanisms in the contact area, nor any zone of inhibition, both before and after exposure. Thiram, bis dimethylthio carbamoyl disulfide, tested as in B at levels of 0.5 2.0 wt. , provided essentially no con trol of the test organisms in the contact area with the exception of the mixed frugal spore, and no zone of inhibition, with the exception of the mixed fungal spore at 2.0 wt. , both before and after exposure. Captafol, cis N 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethyl thio 4 cyclohexene 1,2 dicarboximide, tested as in C at 0.5 and 0.75 wt. , wi th up to 300 hours exposure, controlled test organ isms as follows Staph. aureus 2.5 3.5 urn inhibition N K.

Inhibition of fungal growth dropped sharp ly with exposure. Captan, however, caused yellowing of polyvinyl chloride films after exposure. Unweathered films containing Captan at greater than 0.5 wt. exhibited surface bloom ing, that is, formation of white powder on the surface, believed to be Captan. No powder was seen on the sur faces of weather exposed films however such may have been washed off during the exposure treatment.Methods of FormulatIons For use as plastics or polymer biocides, the compounds disclosed herein may be incorporated in plastics or films or products made therefrom, in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 2.0 by weight of the total composition, preferably 0.01 to 1.0, and most preferably 0.01 to 0.5 by weight. The incorporation may be performed, as was done in the examples, by incorporating an amount of the biocide in a dry mix which is then processed to produce the desired plastic or polymer or ultimate pro duct containing it. Alternatively, the biocide may be incorporated in a dry blend at a higher rate, for instance, 12 13 by weight, to which a small amount of an extrusion aid for instance barium calcium stearate is added, and the blend extruded to form a rod, from which pellets are cut, as described for instance in U.S.Patent 4,086,297. The pellets can then be utilized as a means to incorporate the biocide into subsequent plastic or polymer formulations, with the number of pellets added being determined so as to produce an overall polymer composition including the biocide in the desired or appropriate amount More carrnonly, the antimicrobial compound is predissolved or dispersed in a liquid carrier solvent such as a plasticizer for a polymeric resin, see for instance U.S. Patent 3,288,6741 , thereby providing a vehicle for the biocide for ease of incorporation and to promote its migration throughout the resin, particularly to its surface. Usually, the biocide is dissolved in a first solvent and then diluted with the desired resin compatible plasticizer second solvent to provide a final liquid solution wherein the first solvent acts as a coupling solvent for the biocide and plasticizer to maintain homogeneity Both first and second solvents are themselves nutually compatible with each other and the polymeric resin system. See, for instance, U.S. Patent.3,288,674. For treatment of cellulosic, plastic or polymeric fibers, or fabrics made therefrom, the biocide is applied as a coating by standard methods such as brushing, dipping or spraying, with subsequent drying, in an amount similar to that utilized for plastics and polymers.
