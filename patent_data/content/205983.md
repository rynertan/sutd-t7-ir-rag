## Description
The present invention relates to a color light sensitive material comprising a light sensitive silver salt and at least one image forming compound. There is known a color diffusion transfer photography using an azo dye image forming compound which is adapted to provide, in development under basic conditions, a diffusible azo dye which is different in diffusibility from the parent compound. As examples of image forming compounds capable of releasing a magenta dye, those described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 115528 75, 114424 74 and 4028 80 and U.S. Patents 3,932,380 and 3,931,144, for instance, are known. The term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanese patent application . However, the compounds described in these prior art literatures invariably comprise α naphthols as a coupling component and have the disadvantage of a low dye transfer efficiency or a low light fastness. As the image forming compounds adapted to release a dye comprising a phenol derivative as a coupling component, those described in U.S. Patent 4,473,632 are known. However, the hue of the dye is yellow and there is not known a magenta dye compound comprising a phenol derivative as the coupling component. It is the object of the present invention to provide a color light sensitive material containing an image forming compound which has a satisfactory hue of magenta, gives a high density image in a brief transfer time, and has satisfactory fastness to light. The intensive research undertaken by the present inventors has shown that a dye having a satisfactory hue of magenta is formed upon a coupling reaction between a coupling component comprising a phenol derivative having a certain electron donating group and a diazo component having a certain electron attractive group.

After completion of the addition, 0.2 N sodium hydroxide was added dropwise with ice cooling until the pH of the mixture became 4 to 5. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was adjusted to a pH value not exceeding 2 with 36 hydrochloric acid and 100 g of calcium chloride was added for salting out. The crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with 50 ml of methanol and dried. To a suspension of 18 g of calcium 3 methylsulfonyl 4 2 acetylamino 5 chloro 4 hydroxyphenylazo phenylsulfonate, 25 ml of dimethylacetamide, and 54 ml of acetonitrile was added dropwise to 18 ml of phosphorus oxychloride at room temperature with stirring. After completion of the addition, the reaction was allowed to proceed at 60 C for 3 h, and the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and then poured in 1 ℓ of ice water. The mixture was stirred at a temperature of 10 C or less for 1 h and the resulting crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and air dried.

To this was added 5 g 0.011 mole of 5 acetylamino 2 chloro 4 4 chlorosulfonyl 2 methylsulfonylphenylaso phenol in portions. After 30 min, 1 ml of pyridine and 10 ml of water were added and the mixture was heated to 80 C. After 2 h, 34 ml of acetone and 31 ml of methanol were added and the mixture was cooled to 50 to 60 C. Then, the mixture was maintained at a temperature of 50 C or higher and 34 ml of water was added dropwise thereto, and the resulting mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 h. The crystalline precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with 50 ml of methanol. This crude crystalline precipitate was purified by column chromatography silica gel eluent chloroform methanol v v 40 1 and recrystallized from a mixture of 100 ml of methanol and 20 ml of ethyl acetate. Silver halides which may be used as a light sensitive silver salt to be incorporated in the color light sensitive materials of the present invention may be prepared by a method as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. The present color light sensitive materials may contain additives as described in said U.S. patent and silver halides having characteristics as described in said U.S. patent may be used in the material of the present invention. A silver halide emulsion which is not post ripened, may be used in the material of the present invention and, in general, said emulsion is preferably used after chemically sensitized. For instance, a sulfur sensitization method, a reduction sensitization method or a noble metal sensitization method may be carried out singly or in the form of a combination of said methods, which are known in the art of an emulsion for a conventional light sensitive material. Silver halide emulsions which may be used in the material of the present invention may either be surface latent image type emulsions where a latent image is mainly formed on the surface of the particles or internal latent image type emulsions where a latent image is mainly formed in the inner part of the particles. A direct reversal emulsion comprising a combination of an internal latent image type emulsion and a nucleus forming agent may also be used in the material of the present invention. The amount of the light sensitive silver halide to be coated on a support of the material of the present invention is within the range of 1 mg to 10 g m², as calculated in terms of the coated silver amount. In the present invention, an organic metal salt which is relatively stable to light, especially an organic silver salt, is preferably used as an oxidizing agent, together with the photographic silver halide. Details of said organic silver salts which may be used in the material of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. The silver halides to be used in the material of the present invention may be spectrally sensitized, for example, with a methine dye. Details of said dyes are described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. The photographic materials of the present invention may contain a reducing agent. As said reducing agent, those which are known in this technical field or color image forming compounds having a reductivity are preferred. Examples of reducing agents which may be used in the material of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. The color light sensitive materials of the present invention may contain, in addition to the magenta color image forming compound of formula I , any known yellow and or cyan color image forming compounds and any other known magenta color image forming compounds, as far as said additional image forming compounds do not badly affect the photographic materials of the present invention, whereby color images of a broad range in a chromaticity diagram may be obtained. Accordingly, the color light sensitive materials of the present invention may have at least three light sensitive silver salt layers each having sensitivity in different spectral ranges. Typical combinations comprising at least three light sensitive silver salt emulsion layers each having sensitivity in different spectral ranges, as mentioned above, are described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. The photographic materials of the present invention may contain, if necessary, two or more emulsion layers having sensitivity in the same spectral range, which are distinguished in accordance with the sensitivity of said emulsion. The above mentioned color image forming compounds are added to the above mentioned light sensitive silver salt emulsion layer and or a light insensitive hydrophilic colloid layer which is adjacent to said light sensitive silver salt emulsion layer. For said addition, said image forming compounds may be incorporated in the light sensitive materials together with other photographic additives, by means of a known method, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent 2,322,027. In this case, conventional high boiling point organic solvents, low boiling point organic solvents or other various kinds of surfactants may be used. The amount of the organic solvent to be used in the material of the present invention is 10 g or less, preferably 5 g or less, on the basis of 1 g of image forming compound used. The color light sensitive materials of the present invention have photographic elements comprising a light sensitive element capable of forming or releasing a dye by development to form a color image and, if necessary, a dye fixing element for fixation of the dye formed. In particular, in such a system as forming an image by diffusion transfer of a dye, said light sensitive element and dye fixing element are essential, and two embodiments are typical, one being attained by separately coating said light sensitive element and dye fixing element on two different supports, individually, and the other being attained by coating both of said two elements on the same support together. The system for development of the light sensitive materials of the present invention is not specifically limited, and in particular, a heat development system is preferred in the present invention. In the heat development system, the magenta image forming compounds of formula I may form or release a movable magenta dye, when a light sensitive silver salt is reduced into silver under a high temperature condition, in accordance with or reversely in accordance with said reaction, and the light sensitive materials of the present invention may contain the above mentioned known dye providing substances of yellow and or cyan image forming compounds or known magenta dye providing substances, together with said compounds of formula I . Color image forming compounds or dye providing substances, which may be co used in the photographic materials of the present invention, include, for example, couplers capable of being reacted with a developing agent. In the system where a coupler is used, an oxidized form of a developing agent yields by an oxidation reduction reaction of a silver salt and said developing agent reacts with the coupler to form a dye, which is described in numerous well known publications. Examples of developing agents and couplers are described in detail in The Theory of the Photographic Process written by T.H. James , 4th Ed., pp. 291 334 and pp. 354 361, and Photographic Chemistry written by Shinichi Kikuchi and published by Kyoritsu Shuppan Publishing Co. , 4th Ed., pp. 284 295. Silver dye compounds comprising a combination of an organic silver salt and a dye may be examples of said dye providing substances. Concrete examples of said silver dye compounds are described in Research Disclosure May, 1978 , RD No. 16966. Azo dyes which may be used in a heat development silver dye bleaching method may be examples of said dye providing substances. Concrete examples of said azo dyes and said bleaching method are described in U.S. Patent 4,235,957 and Research Disclosure April, 1976 , RD No. 14433. In addition, leuco dyes as described, e.g., in U.S. Patents 3,985,565 and 4,022,617 may be examples of said dye providing substances. Other examples of said dye providing substances include compounds having a function capable of imagewise releasing and diffusing a diffusible dye. Said compounds may be represented by formula LI Various examples of the dye providing substances of formula LI are disclosed in various patent specifications. For instance, U.S. Patents 3,134,764, 3,362,819, 3,597,200, 3,544,545 and 3,482,972 describe color developers comprising a combination of a hydroquinone type developing agent and a dye component Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 63618 76 describes substances that may release a diffusible dye by an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 111628 74 describes substances that may release a diffusible dye by an intramolecular rearrangement reaction of an isoxazolone ring. In all of said means, a diffusible dye is released or diffused in a non developed part, but no dye is released or diffused in a developed part. Apart from said means, another type of means has heretofore been proposed, where a dye releasing compound is previously converted into an oxidized form having no dye releasing ability and said oxidized compound is used together with a reducing agent or a precursor thereof, and, after development, said compound is reduced with said reducing agent, which has remained non oxidized, thereby releasing a diffusible dye from said compound. Examples of dye providing substances which may be used in said means are described, for example, in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 110827 78, 130927 79, 164342 81 and 35533 78. On the other hand, still other substances are known capable of releasing a diffusible dye in a developed part. For Instance, British Patent 1,330,524, Japanese Patent Publication No. 39165 73 and U.S. Patent 3,443,940 describe substances capable of releasing a diffusible dye by reaction of a coupler having a removable group of a diffusible dye and a developing agent in an oxidized form and U.S. Patent 3,227,550 describes substances capable of forming a diffusible dye by reaction of a coupler having a removable group of a nondiffusible group and a developing agent in an oxidized form. However, said means using such color developing agents have a severe problem in that a formed image is often stained due to an oxidized and decomposed product of the developing agent used. In order to overcome said problem, some other dye providing compounds which themselves have a reductivity and do not require any developing agent have heretofore been proposed. Typical examples of said compounds are given in the following literature and publications. Definitions of general formulae therein are referred to those as described in the respective literature or publications. For instance, various kinds of dye providing substances as described in U.S. Patents 3,928,312, 4,053,312, 4,055,428 and 4,336,322, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 65839 84, 69839 84, 3819 78 and 104343 76, Research Disclosure, RD No. 17645, U.S. Patents 3,725,062, 3,728,113 and 3,443,939 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 116537 83 may be used in the present invention together with the present compound of formula I . Concrete examples of dye providing substances which may be co used together with the dye providing substances of formula I are compounds as described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 84236 84, and in particular, Compounds 1 to 3 , 10 to 13 , 16 to 19 , 28 to 30 , 33 , 35 , 38 to 40 , 42 to 64 as described in said patent publication are preferably used in the present invention. In addition, compounds as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 are also useful. Regarding the relation between the light sensitive element and the dye fixing element, the relation between a support and said elements and the relation between a white reflective layer and said elements of the color photographic materials of the present invention, the contents in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be applied to the present invention. The light sensitive elements may contain, in addition to the light sensitive silver salt emulsion layer, if necessary, a protective layer, an intermediate layer, an antistatic layer, a curling preventing layer, a peeling layer, a matting layer or another auxiliary layer. For coating said layers on a support, the means as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be applied thereto. In particular, an organic or inorganic matting agent is generally incorporated into a protective layer for the purpose of prevention of adhesion. In addition, said protective layer may further contain a mordanting agent or a UV absorbent. The protective layer and intermediate layer may comprise two or more layers, individually. The intermediate layer may contain a reducing agent for prevention of color stain, a UV absorbent or a white pigment such as TiO₂. Said white pigment may be added not only to the intermediate layer but also to an emulsion layer for the purpose of increasing the sensitivity thereof. The dye fixing element contains at least one layer containing a mordanting agent, and in the case when a dye fixing layer is positioned in the outermost surface part of said element, an additional protective layer may be provided thereon, if necessary. The dye fixing element which may be used in the material of the present invention may have, in addition to the above described layers, if necessary, a peeling layer, a matting agent layer, a curling preventing layer or another auxiliary layer. One or more of the above described layers may further contain a base and or a base precursor for acceleration of dye transference, a hydrophilic hot melting solvent, a discoloration inhibitor for inhibition of discoloration of dyes formed, a UV absorbent, a vinyl compound dispersion for increment of dimensional stability or a fluorescent agent. Regarding the layer constitution, binder, additives, addition of mordanting agent and position of the above described light sensitive element and or dye fixing element of the material of the present invention, the technical contents as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be applied to the case of the present invention. Regarding the light source for imagewise exposure of the photographic materials of the present invention to record images thereon, a radiation including visible rays may be applied to the present materials, and for instance, light sources as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be applied thereto. The photographic materials of the present invention may contain an image forming accelerator. Image forming accelerators are those having various kinds of functions, for example, to accelerate the oxidation reduction reaction of a silver salt oxidizing agent and a reducing agent, to accelerate the formation of a dye from a dye providing substance or the decomposition of the dye formed or the release of a movable dye from a dye providing substance, or to accelerate the transference of the dye formed from a light sensitive element layer to a dye fixing element layer. From the viewpoint of the physicochemical functions of said accelerators, these may be classified into bases or base precursors, nucleophilic compounds, oils, hot melting solvents, surfactants and compounds having a mutual reactivity with silver or silver ion. In this connection, it is to be noted that said accelerator substances have in general composite functions and have two or more accelerating functions as mentioned above. Details of said image forming accelerators are described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. Various kinds of development stopping agents may be used for the light sensitive materials of the present invention for the purpose of obtaining at any time constant images relative to the variation of the treatment temperature and treatment time during development. Development stopping agents used herein are compounds which may neutralize a base or may react therewith immediately after a proper development of the light sensitive material, to lower the concentration of the base existing in the photographic layer thereby to stop the development of said material, or compounds which may mutually react with a silver or a silver salt immediately after a proper development, thereby to stop the development. The light sensitive materials of the present invention may further contain a compound which may activate the development and at the same time may stabilize the image formed. The light sensitive materials of the present invention may contain, if necessary, an image toning agent. Examples of effective toning agents which may be used in the material of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626. The binder to be used in the light sensitive element or in the dye fixing element of the light sensitive materials of the present invention may be used singly or in the form of a mixture of two or more kinds of binders. Said binders are preferably hydrophilic. In particular, transparent or semitransparent hydrophilic binders are typical, for example, including natural substances such as proteins, e.g., gelatin, gelatin derivatives or cellulose derivatives, and polysaccharides such as starch or gum arabic and synthetic polymer substances such as water soluble polyvinyl compounds, e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone or acrylamide polymer. In addition, other synthetic polymer substances may also be used for said binder, such as a dispersive vinyl compound in the form of a latex, which may especially increase the dimensional stability of photographic materials. The amount of the binder to be coated is 20 g m² or less, preferably 10 g m² or less, more preferably 7 g m² or less. The ratio of a high boiling point organic solvent to be dispersed in said binder together with a hydrophobic compound such as a dye providing substance to the binder is suitably 1 mℓ or less of said solvent to 1 g of the binder , preferably 0.5 mℓ or less of the solvent , more preferably 0.3 mℓ or less of the solvent , to 1 g of the binder . Supports which may be used for the light sensitive element and the dye fixing element in the light sensitive materials of the present invention, the latter dye fixing element being optional in the present materials, are those which may be resistant to the treatment temperature, in the case when the materials are treated in a heat development system. In general, not only glasses, papers, metals and the analogue substances but also various support materials as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be used as supports in the material of the present invention. The light sensitive materials of the present invention may contain a dye transferring assistant agent for accelerating the transference of the dye formed in the light sensitive element from said element into the dye fixing element. Said dye transferring assistant agent may be applied to the photographic material after development, or alternatively may previously be incorporated therein before development. In the former system where said dye transferring assistant agent is added later, water or a basic aqueous solution containing an inorganic alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium hydroxide or an organic base may be used. The bases which may be used in the material of the present invention are those as described hereinbefore with respect to image forming accelerators. In addition, a low boiling point solvent such as methanol, N,N dimethylformamide, acetone or diisobutyl ketone or a mixture solution comprising said low boiling point solvent and water or a basic aqueous solution may also be used. In order to add said dye transferring assistant agent, the dye fixing element and or the light sensitive element may be wetted with said assistant agent. In the latter system where the dye transferring assistant agent is previously incorporated in the light sensitive element and or the dye fixing element, it is of course unnecessary to add later any further dye transferring assistant agent. For application of the dye transferring assistant agent to the light sensitive element and or the dye fixing element, for example, the means as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be used. For the development of the light sensitive element and or the transference of the movable dye into the dye fixing element in the light sensitive materials of the present invention, a heating means with a mere hot plate, an iron or a hot roller may be utilized. In particular, in the case when an electric heating means is utilized, a transparent or opaque heating element may be formed in a conventional manner known for manufacture of electric heating elements. For manufacture of said electric heating elements, two means may be used, including a method where a membrane of an inorganic semiconductive material is used and another method where an organic membrane comprising a dispersion of electroconductive fine particles dispersed in a binder is used. For the manufacture of said elements in accordance with said means, materials as described in U.S. Patent 4,500,626 may be used, and these materials are processed according to the direction, the means and the layer constitution as described in said U.S. patent. Regarding the mutual relation of the position of each of the heating element and the light sensitive element, the matter as described in said U.S. patent may also be applied to the case of the present invention. Apart from said case, the electric heating element may be provided in a dye fixing element of the light sensitive materials of the present invention. In the case when the step for the heat development of the light sensitive element and the step for the transference of the dye formed to the dye fixing element are separately carried out in the light sensitive materials of the present invention, the heating temperature in the heat development step for heating the light sensitive material of the present invention is in the range of about 80 C to about 250 C, and is especially preferably about 110 C to about 180 C. On the other hand, the heating temperature in the transfer process for the transference of the dye formed in the light sensitive material of the present invention is in the range of from the heating temperature in said heat development step to room temperature, and is especially preferable up to a temperature lower than the temperature in said heat development step by about 10 C. The development and the transfer may be carried out at the same time or continuously, as described in detail in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 218443 84, which is advantageous in the present invention. In this means, said image forming accelerator and or dye transferring assistant agent may previously be incorporated in both or either the dye fixing element and or the light sensitive element, or alternatively, may be added later to said element s . In said system where the development and the transference are carried out at the same time or continuously, the heating temperature is preferably 60 C or higher, and preferably a temperature lower than the boiling point of the solvent used in the transference step. For instance, in the case when water is used as a solvent in transference, said temperature is preferably 60 C to 100 C. The present invention will now be explained in greater detail by reference to the following examples. Unless otherwise indicated, all percents and ratios are by weight. A silver benzotriazole emulsion was prepared as follows The pH value of this silver benzotriazole emulsion was regulated and sedimented to remove the excess salt therefrom. Afterwards, the pH value thereof was adjusted to 6.30 to obtain 400 g of the aimed silver benzotriazole emulsion. A silver halide emulsion to be used in the fifth layer and the first layer was prepared as follows After washing with water and demineralizing, 5 mg of sodium thiosulfate and 20 mg of 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetraazaindene were added to the obtained emulsion and heated at 60 C for chemical sensitization thereof. The yield of the emulsion formed was 600 g. Next, a silver halide emulsion for the third layer was prepared as follows After washing with water and demineralizing, 5 mg of sodium thiosulfate and 20 mg of 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetraazaindene were added to the obtained emulsion and heated at 60 C for chemical sensitization thereof. The yield of the emulsion formed was 600 g. Next, a gelatin dispersion of a dye providing substance as a color image forming compound was prepared as follows In the same manner as mentioned above, with the exception that Magenta Dye Providing Substance 1 as given hereinbefore was used instead of Yellow Dye Providing Substance A and 7.5 g of tricresyl phosphate was used as a high boiling point solvent, a magenta dye providing substance dispersion was obtained. In addition, a cyan dye providing substance dispersion was formed using Cyan Dye Providing Substance B as given hereinafter in the same manner as mentioned above. Using these materials, a color photographic material composed of a multilayer constitution as shown in the following Table 1 was formed. In the same manner with the exception that the above mentioned Magenta Dye Providing Substance C or the above mentioned Magenta Dye Providing Substance 6 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 19 , 24 , 26 , or 29 was used instead of Magenta Dye Providing Substance 1 , other color photographic materials were formed. Next, a dye fixing material having a dye fixing layer was prepared as follows 0.75 g of the following Gelatin Hardener H 1 , 0.25 g of the following Gelatin Hardener H 2 , 155 mℓ of water, 5 mℓ of 1 Surfactant W 1 and 100 mg of 10 lime treated gelatin were uniformly blended. The resulting mixture solution was uniformly coated on a paper support laminated with a titanium oxide dispersed polyethylene to form a wet film layer having a thickness of 60 µm and then dried. Next, 15 g of the following Polymer I and 5 g of the following Polymer II were dissolved in 180 mℓ of water, and the resulting solution was uniformly blended with 15 mℓ of 5 Surfactant W 1 and 100 g of 10 lime treated gelatin. The resulting mixture solution was uniformly coated on the previously coated film to form a wet film layer having a thickness of 85 µm. This was dried to form a dye fixing material. The color photographic material of multilayer constitution as obtained above was exposed to a tungsten lamp of 500 lux for 1, through a G R IR three color separation filter composed of a 500 600 nm band pass filter for G, a 600 700 nm band pass filter for R and a filter to pass 700 nm or more for IR, the color density in said filter continuously varying. After the exposure, the material was uniformly heated on a heat block heated at 140 C for 30 s. Next, water was applied to the surface of the layer of the dye fixing material in an amount of 15 mℓ m² and the above light sensitive material, after heat treatment, was put on said dye fixing material so that the surfaces of the coated film layer in each material faced to each other. The thus adhered photographic material was heated on a heat block heated at 80 C for 3 s or for 6 s, and then the dye fixing material was peeled off from the photographic material, whereby yellow, magenta and cyan images were formed on the fixing material, corresponding to the G R IR three color separation filter, respectively. Next, a transparent film having an ultraviolet absorbing layer was put on the surface of the film layer of the dye fixing material having said negative images, and a xenon ray 100,000 lux was irradiated on the color images for 7 days. The density of the color images before and after irradiation of said xenon ray was measured, and the light fastness of the images formed was evaluated from the measured data. The following Table 2 shows the transferred density of magenta obtained in correspondence to a G filter and the dye retention percentage at a reflection density of 1.0. It will be apparent from the above table that the color photosensitive materials containing the magenta dye providing substance according to the present invention are superior to the comparative example materials in the transferability and light fastness of the magenta dye.
