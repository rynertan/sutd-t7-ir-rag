# A PROCESS FOR IMPARTING DURABLE PRESS PROPERTIES TO CELLULOSE OR CELLULOSE CONTAINING TEXTILE MATERIALS AND THE MATERIALS HAVING SUCH PROPERTIES

## Abstract
The production of durable press textile materials com prises applying to the material a composition comprising a a specified amount of activated water soluble bis vinyl compound, b a specified amount of certain copolymer containing units of quaternary monomer obtainable by reacting certain epihalohydrins with certain ammonium salts and c aqueous base to effect a pH of 9 to 12 and drying and curing at elevated temperature. The process is applicable to cellulose, or cellulose containing materials. The treated durable press material bears, as a durable press finish, the cured polymer composition.
