## Description
MODIFIED POLYOLEFINIC COMPOSITIONS We, RENOUT COATING CHEMIE, of I469 Chemin desTrious, 06570 Saint Paul de Vence, France, do hereby declare the invention, for which we pray that a patent may be granted to us, and the method by which it is to be performed, to be particularly described in and by the following statement This invention relates to primers for polyolefinic substrates, giving excellent adhesion to both polyolefinics and adhesives used on the non polyolefinic substrates. Polyolefines, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene propylene terpolymers are widely used in the industry for many applications due to their specific mechanical properties and excellent chemical and weathering resistance. However, due to the excellent resistance to chemicals of the polyolefinic materials, adhesives do not react with the surface of the polyolefines. This results then in a weak bonding between the polyolefines and other substrates such as metals, plastics, rubber, glass, leather, concrete and others. Various methods have been tried out to improve the bonding of adhesives to polyolefines. For example, surface treatment by flame oxidation, chlorine treatment, ozone oxidation, radiation, corona discharge or chromic acid etching have been used.None of these methods yield satisfactory results for adhering polyolefines to non polyolefinic substrates for reason of the complexity of the surface treatment applied on irregular shaped articles, blends of polyolefines do not respond to the surface treatment, final bondstrength obtained is too low for many applications Various processes have been proposed for bonding the polyolefinic materials to other non polyolefinic substrates by using modified polyolefines or using inter i7ediate coatings of modified polyolefines to straight forward polyolefines. The modified polyolefines mainly consist of grafted, functional groups like maleic anhydride, acrylic acid or epoxy to the polyolefines or by the use of ethylenevinylacetate copolymers.The use of these modified polyolefines improve the adhesion of the polyolefines to metals to a certain extent, however, they are often not economicly practical, because the bonding of the functional groups on the polyolefine to metal takes only place at the melt temperature of the polyolefine. This will require capital plant investments for processing equipment also the shape of the articles is a limiting factor. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a primer composition based on blends of a modified or grafted polyolefine s , b crosslinkable binder s and c specific crosslinking agent s . Compositions in accordance with the invention can be used as primers to provide excellent adhesion to polyolefinic materials, such as both lineair low density and low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, ethylene propylene polymers, ethylene propylene terpolymers, ethylene vinylacetate copolymers. These polyolefines may be used alone or as a combination of two or more. Compositions in accordance with the invention can be used as primers to provide excellent adhesion to the wide range of commercialy availble adhesives such as for example cyanoacrylates, epoxies, polyurethanes, acrylics, polyamides, polyesters, nitrile rubber phenolics, polychloroprene rubber phenolics, polyvinyl butyrals or blended compositions Hetweexl the various adhesives. The crosslinkable binder s and the specific crosslinking agent s in the primer can react with the functional group s of the adhesive used. The compositions of the invention comprise a blend of a modified or grafted polyolefine s , b crosslinkable binder s and c specific crosslinking agent s .The physical form of the primer composition of the invention can be in solvents, such as aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons, or as a resin emulsion in water or in a dry solventless form as a powder or as a hotmelt. A composition comprising the above ingredients makes it possible to bond non treated polyolefines to other non polyolefinic substrates, whereby the primer of the composition will make the bond between the non treated polyolefinic surface and between the adhesive coat applied to the other non polyolefinic substrate. The modified or grafted polyolefinic components used in the invention are based upon a modified polyolefines by chlorination with a chlorine by weight between IO and 80, whereby the polyolefine may consist of polyethylene, polypropylene or ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers or blends between each other b grafted polyolefines with functional carboxyl groups, derived from treatment withI acrylic acids and its derivates or 2 maleic acid and its derivates. The grafted polyolefines may consist of polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene vinylacetate copoly tuners or ethylene propylene terpolymer.The above mentionned modified and grafted polyolefines may be used alone or as a combination of two or more in the primer composition. The crosslinkable binder s of the primer composition of the invention need to function as compatibelizer agent s between the modified or grafted polyolefinic component s and the crosslinking agent s used for the selected adhesive in order to keep the composition of the primer stable.The binder material s will also function as a viscosity modifier in case of solvent or waterbased primer compositions and as a carrier for other additives, such as antioxidants, curing agents, heatstabilizers and colorants.The binder material s shall not negatively effect the adhesion between the primer and the polyolefinic substrate as well as the adhesion between the primer and the adhesive on the non polyolefinic substrate.The nature of the binder material s may be a natural rubber or synthetic rubber component s , b plastic compo netts , c natural or synthetic resin component s . Depending on the binder component s selected for the primer, crosslinking of the bindermaterial s may be carries out via the conventional chemical or radiation crosslinking techniques, if required for the performance of the bonded article over a certain temperature range.The binder material s can be used in a proportion of 0,05 from 75 parts, preferably from 5 till 50 parts, by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the modified or grafted polyolefines . The crosslinking agent s of the primers of the invention consist mainly of ingredient s which are derived of the crosslinking system used in the adhesive coat on the non polyolefinic substrate. The nature of the crosslinking agent s used in the primer composition will be almost equivalent to the nature of the crosslinking agent s used for the adhesives, such as for example a crosslinking agents based on amines, amidoamines and polyamides for the epoxy and acrylic based adhesives, b crosslinking agents based on isocyanates for the polyurethane , acrylic and rubber resin based adhesives c crosslinking agents which are carboxylic or hydroxyl terminated for the polyurethane , acrylic and epoxy based adhesives.The function of the crosslinking agent s in the primer composition of the invention is to bond the primercoat to the adhesivecoat on the non polyolefinic substrate and is based on the same principle of crosslinking, as whereby the adhesive coat will crosslink by itself as defined by the nature of its composition. Secondly the function of the crosslinking agent s can be that it can crosslink the bindermaterial s in the primer composition, resulting in excellent bondstrengths of the final article over a broad temperature range. The preparation of the solvent based primers consist of the mixing of the modified or grafted polyolefine s , the crosslinkable binder component s and the crosslinking agent s into a solventblend appropriate to the components chosen the mixing is done under high shear forces and at elevated temperature. The preparation of the waterbased primers consist of the emulsification of the primer component s into water using the standard techniques for making stable emulsions. The preparation of the solventless primers consist of dryblending of the primer components using the conventional techniques as for rubber, plastic or hotmelt blending. This invention is illustrated by the following examples, but they are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. Example I 5 parts by weight of a chlorinated polypropylene, 2,5 parts by weight of an ethyl ene vinyl ace tate copolymer and 2,5 parts by weight of an epoxy crosslinking agent were dissolved in 75 parts by weight of trichloroethylene and 25 parts by weight of toluene. This primer solution was applied to a non treated polyolefinic substrate, dried and heat activated during 30 seconds at I250C. Afterwards an epoxy adhesive, Araldit AW 106 HV935U from Ciba Geigy was used for bonding the polyolefinic substrate to steel.After crosslinking of the epoxy adhesive the shearstrength was determined and found at 70 daN cm2 2 for polypropylene, 36 daN cm2 for high density polyethylene, 33 daN cm2 for low density polyethylene, 33 daN cm2 for polybutene andI9,5 daN cm2 for a blend of EPDM PP Santoprene I03 40 fromMonsanto Cy . Example II IO parts by weight of a chlorinated and grafted polyolefin I blend, 2,5 parts by weight of an ethylene vinylacetate copolymer and 2,5 parts by weight of a polyamide crosslinking agent were dissolved in 75 parts by weight of trichloroethylene and 25 parts by weight of toluene. This primer solution was applied to a non treated polyolefinic substrate, dried and heat activated during 30 seconds at I25 C. Afterwards a cyanoacrylate adhesive B 20 from 3M was used for bonding the polyolefinic substrate to steel. After the crosslinking of the cyanoacrylate adhesive the shearstrength was determined and found at 80 daN cm2 for polypropylene, 35 daN cm2 for high density polyethylene, 2 31 daN cm2 for low density polyethylene, 34 daN cm for polybutene and I3,5 daN cm for a blend EPDM PP SantopreneI03 40 from Monsanto Cy . Example III 30 parts by weight of a chlorinated polypropylene, 5 parts by weight of an ethylene vinylacetate copolymer and 2,5 parts by weight of a hydroxyl terminated acrylate were dissolved in 100 parts by weight of trichloroethylene. This primer solution was coated onto a non treated polyolefinic substrate and dried a polyurethane adhesive with an isocyanate donor was blended with the primer solution in a I I ratio and coated to a non treated polyester fabric. The coated polyolefinic substrate and the coated polyester fabric were laminated together at I800C, under 5 bar pressure and within I second. Cooling down of the laminate was done at mild pressure and peel strength were determined after full crosslinking of the polyurethane adhesive.Peelstrength results found were 35 N cm for EPDM PP Santoprene IOI 73 , 45 N cm for EPDM PP Santoprene I03 40 fromMonsanto Cy and 61 N cm for polypropylene.All the polyolefinic substrates described in the examplesI, II and III, as well as the non polyolefinic substrates and the adhesives used were commercially available products.
