# Clip type electrode for electrocardiographs.

## Abstract
A clip type electrode includes a pair of clamping plates 12, 13 for being opened and closed relative to each other about a common shaft 11 and having concave surfaces 16, 17 facing each other, an electrode member 19 mounted on one of the clamping plates 12 , and a spring 18 coiled around the common shaft 11 for biasing the ends of the clamping plates 12, 13 remote from the common shaft 11 towards each other. One of the clamping plates 12 is longer than the other. The electrode member 19 includes a strip of resilient, electrically conductive material bent into a U shaped cross section thus providing a pressuring plate section 20 for applying pressure to the limb of a patient, and a pair of engagement plates 21, 22 each upstanding from opposing edges of the pressuring plate section 20 and having plural inwardly projecting bosses 26,27,35,36 . The engagement plates 21, 22 clamp the longitudinal edges of the longer one 12 of the clamping plates 12, 13 for attaching the electrode member 19 to the clamping plate 12 . The pressuring plate section 20 is brought into intimate contact with the surface of the skin of the patient s limb to uniformalize the contact resistance and eliminate noise or distortion in the output waveform, thereby making possible accurate diagnosis of the condition of the heart. Since one of the pair of the clamping plates 12 is longer than the other 13 , the electrodes is unlikely to be detached by movement of the limb.
