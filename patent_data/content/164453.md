## Description
A process for preparing particulate free flowing concentrates of thermoplastic polymers and additives therefor, said concentrates being low in dust content.The invention relates to a process for preparing particulate free flowing concentrates of thermoplastic polymers and additives therefor, said concentrates being low in dust content, by intimately mixing powdery polymer and powdery additives in a weight ratio of powdery polymer to powdery additives of at most 1 9 with small amounts of plasticizer and or lubricant.Approximately 90 of the total world consumption of plastics is formed by thermoplastic polymers, in particular the so called bulk polymers1 , for example vinyl halide co polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, polyolefines, such as high and low pressure polyethylene and high and low pressure polypropylene and the styrene co polymers, such as polystyrene and ABS.Producers supply said thermoplastic polymers in the form of powders, from which the processing industry, e.g. by extruding or by injection moulding, make articles.For said manufacturing of articles the polymer powders are to be premixed with various kinds of additives required for the processing and or for obtaining the final properties of the articles Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 2nd Ed. Viol. 15, page 800 1968 .It depends on the polymer which additives have to be applied videJ. Voigt, Die Stabilisierung der Kunststoffe gegen Licht und warme, Springer Verlag 1966, pages 256 259 K. Thinius,Stabilisierung und Alterung won Plastwerkstoffen, Vol. I, VerlagChemie 1969, page 236 . Before processing polyolefines in general supplied by producers as anti oxydant containing powders are to be mixed with metal soaps e.g. Ca stearate or a Ca and Zn stearate mixture functioning as stabilizer, but especially as lubricant or releasing agent and also optionally with pigments and or fillers, flame retardants,U.V. stabilizers and the like.Polystyrene and ABS, before processing, must also be mixed with metal soaps functioning as stabiliser, but especially functioning as lubricant and releasing agent, and if desired can also be fixed with pigments, fillers, flame retardants, U.V. stabilizers and the like.Vinyl halide polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, and copolymers of vinyl chloride with ocopatible monomers substantially consisting of vinyl chloride rests, are to be mixed with heavy metal stabilizers, such as basic inorganic lead salts and basic lead soaps, mixtures of bariunr and cadmium soaps, mixture of Ca andZn soaps, with antioxidants, U.V. stabilizers, lubricants, inter alia metal soaps and if desired with plasticizers.A great deal of these additives, for example the metal soaps such as Pb , Cd , Ba , Ca and Zn stearate, the pigments, the heavymetal stabilizers, various fillers, such as chalk and baryte, are very dusty which leads to problems in plants processing this kind of thermoplastic polymers, on the one hand because of the danger of dust explosions, and on the other hand because some additives, notably lead stabilizers, are toxic and may affect the health.For vinyl halide polymers it is already known to draft these problems by means of a process of the type mentioned in the preamble.For example, in U.S. patent specification 3 905 927 such a process for the preparation of vinyl halide additive concentrates is disclosed, said concentrates comprising 60 to 90 by weight of stabilizer 5 to 35 by weight of polyvinyl chloride 0.1 to 20 by weight of plasticizer and 0.5 to 15 by weight of lubricant, and in particular 75 to 85 by weight of stabilizer, 10 to 20 by weight of polyvinyl chloride 2 to 15 by weight of plasticizer and 1 to 3 by weight of lubricant.The preparation of said mixtures can take place in any mixer, such as a sigma blade mixer a kneading mixer having a sigma shaped mixing means a ribbon blender or a high speed mixer coffee blender and the components, optionally preheated, are fed to the mixer in any sequence.With said process, irrespective of the kind of mixer used and irrespective of the fact that one or more of the components are preheated, suitable concentrates masterbatch mixtures are obtained, but the mixtures being prepared in a slowly processing mixer, for example a sigma blade mixer or a ribbon blender, starting from non preheated components, at the end of the mixing process the mixture having a temperature of about 250 to 350C, show highly profitable properties in practice, as appeared in applicants investigation. Under the microscope the concentrate particles look like more or less homogenous polymer particles, the surface of which varying from a rather oth surface when the additive particles penetrated the surface of the polymer to a somewhat coarse sawdust surface1 in case the additive particles are attached to the surface of the polymer.In Belgian patent specification 866 227 a process for the preparation of concentrates masterbatch mixtures of polyvinyl chloride with stabilizers and small amounts of plasticizer s and or lubricant s is disclosed, wherein the mixing conditions are even adjusted in such a manner that mixing takes place at the environmental temperature 15 250C , by using slowly processing mixers signa blade mixers and or by cooling the mixer during the mixing process when using high speed mixers, such as turbo mixers.With a o7lnts of plasticizer and or lubricant of at most 5 parts by weight on 100 parts by weight of polyvinyl chloride plus stabilizer, according to said patent specification the polymer is activated by the plasticizer s and or lubricant s , so that the polymer easily absorbs the additive particles. In this manner a concentrate with excellent properties is produced in about 10 minutes.In French patent specification 2 100 304 a process for the preparation of concentrates masterbatch mixtures of vinyl halide polymers polyvinyl chloride with stabilizers and if desired also small amounts of plasticizer s and or lubricant s is disclosed, said process, precisely reversed, being carried out at high temperature. The powdered polymer and the powdered stabilizer s in a weight ratio of 1 5 to 5 1 are mixed in a turbo mixer externally brought at 80 C, the temperature elevating to about 110 C, followed by cooling to 80 C and subsequently removing the concentrate from the mixer.It was now discovered that, with a process of the kind mentioned in the preamble, while applying a high speed mixer, for example a turbo mixer or a Papenmeier or Henschel mixer, vinyl halide polymer concentrates can be prepared which as to their properties are not surpassed by products obtained by mixing at low temperature, without cooling the mixer and also without external heating the mixer and its contents to reach temperatures of about 1100C during the mixing, when during the mixing the power consumed by the mixing means is limited, and when reaching the maximum power consumption the number of revolutions of said mixing means is reduced, while maintaining that power.In addition it was found that with this process also excellent, particulate, free flowing concentrates of other thermoplastic polymers said concentrates being low in dust content, namely bulk polymers such as polyolefines and styrene polymers with powdered additives, can be produced. The invention consequently relates to a process of the kind mentioned in the preamble characterized in that, while applying a high speed mixer, during mixing the power consumed ly the mixing means is limited, and when reaching the maximum power consumption the number of revolutions of saidmixing means is reduced, while maintaining that power.Whereas in the known processes applying a high speed mixer, an excess of mixing energy and heat is supplied, which is to be removed either by cooling the mixer during the mixing process Belgian patent specification 866 227 , or must be removed afterwards, by cooling the mixture while stirring till below 800c, before discharging the mixer French patent specification 2 100 304 , in the process according to the invention exactly the required amount of lixing energy is fed supplied in order to obtain the desired Mixing results.Under these conditions a temperature of the mixture between about 400C and 800C is reached, measured 40 cm above the bottom of the mixing trough between the uppermost and central blades of the mixing means, and the concentrate is of highly uniform particle size when during mixing temperatures arise of gt 90 C, in practice rather a lot of coarse particles are produced which give trouble in use, because they are hard to disperse in additional polymer.This result can for example be reached by means of a hydraulic coupling between the motor and the mixing means of the high speed mixer. During Mixing the powdery additives are included in and or attached to the polymer particles, resulting in a certain densification of the mixture, and the resistance of the mixture in the mixer increases. Due to such a hydraulic coupling between stirring motor and mixing means the rate of the mixing means is reduced, while the stirring means does not release a greater power to the mixture. Preferably the power consumed by the mixing means is, however, limited and controlled by means of a thyristor control upon the stirring motor. whereas with a hydraulic coupling the power released by the mixing means is limited due to the fact that slip occurs in the hydraulic coupling when the resistance of the mixture in the mixer rises, the power absorbed by the stirring motor can be directly limited and controlled by a thyristor control, so that the desired results can better be controlled and in addition the energy consumption is minimized.Due to the power limitation and control of the number of revolutions of the stirring motor the densifying phase can be controlled and a better average product quality is reached, while the capacity of the mixer can be utilized completely.Determining for the properties of the product concentrate that is obtained with the process of the invention, is beside the above mentioned control of the power released by the mixing means, also the total amount of energy which is released by means of the mixing means of the high speed mixer to the components of the concentrate. Experience has taught that for each concentrate to be prepared dependent on the composition , optimum properties are reached at a predetermined value for the total energy to be released to the mixture and that said condition are met, when the stirring rate of the mixing means has been reduced to a predetermined minimum.Thus, preferably the mixer is switched off when a predetermined minimum number of revolutions of the mixing means is reached.In practice this boils down to 60 90 of the maximum mixing rate, then the concentrate has in general the most profitable properties.For concentrates wherein light additives, such as alkaline earth metal soaps, are applied, that situation is generally reached after 5 to 10 minutes. For concentrates, wherein heavy additives are applied, such as inorganic lead stabilizers basic lead salts with inorganic acids this situation is generally reached after mixing for 1 to 4 minutes.As additives the powdery additives usual for the respective polymer are used in the process according to the invention. As plasticizer and or lubricants also the usual materials for this purpose exerting an activating activity on the polymer in the above mentioned sense, are also used. The sequence wherein the components of the concentrates are cnihined, is not critical for the process according to the invention. For example, one can premix the polymer and the plasticizer and or lubricant scene time together, before adding the powdery additives, as is also done according to Belgian patent specification 8iG 227.Preferably, however, according to the process of the invention powdery polymer and powdery additives are premixed at the maximum number of revolutions of the mixer and subsequently the plasticizers and or lubricants are added. In this manner the plasticizer s and or lubricants are easily distributed uniformly over the powdery mixture and the best result is achieved.Premixing polymer and powdery additives preferably takes 5 10 s. Pre ixing for a shorter peribd than 5 s. does not produce a homogeneous distribution of polymer powder and powdery additives.Premixing for a longer period than 10 s. does not give any advantages and only prolongs the total mixing period.In concentrates of the present kind the amount of active powdery additives, such as stabilizers and lubricants or releasing agents is preferably as hich as possible, and the amount of plasticizer s and or lubricant s is preferably as small as possible, because this produces concentrates which are the most profitable in practice.Good results are obtained by applying powdery polymer and powdery additives in a mixing ratio of polymer to powdery additives of 1 1 to 1 9 and by using l 5 parts by weight of plasticizer s and or lubricants npon 100 parts by weight of polymer plus powdery additives and consequently it is preferred to maintain these ratios. The process according to the invention is elucidated with reference to the figure schematically showing the power consumption by a high speed mixer, with thyristor controlled stirring motor against the mixing time and the number of revolutions of the mixing means against the mixing time and by means of the following examples.Example 1In a Papenmeier mixer having a thyristor controlled stirring motor were fed polyvinyl chloride powder Varlan S5920 50 parts by weight powdery dibasic lead stearate 50 parts by weight. The stirring means of the mixer was switched on at the maximum 1 stirring rate 500 min. the power consumption amounted to about 20 of the maximum power permissible for the motor.After 10 s. there was added under continuous stirring dioctylphthalate DOP 1.5 parts by weight.After 7 minutes stirring motor at constant stirring rate the power consumed by the stirring motor has increased to the maximum power permissible for the stirring motor.There after the power consumption was kept constant. The stirring rate decreased gradually. When the stirring rate had decreased to 350 min. 1 8 min. after starting the mixing process the mixer was switched off.The mixture had a temperature of 60 C and consisted of smooth polymer particles with low dust content, wherein the stabilizer was completely embedded, having good free flowing properties. The course of such a fixing process ii reproduced in the graph of fig. 1.Examples II up to and including XIX.The process of example I was repeated, with the components mentioned in the following table, the mixing conditions were adjusted to the nature of the components. In all cases first the polymer and the additive s were fed to the mixer and premixed at full mixing rate 500 min. 1 for 10 s and subsequently under continuous stirring the plasticizer and or the lubricant were added in one batch.The other working conditions and the resul achieved are also mentioned in the table.
