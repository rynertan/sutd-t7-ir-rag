## Description
The present invention relates to a novel antiobitic that is produced by a microorganism of the genus Compounds of the Anthracycline family e.g. Adriamycin and Acracinomycin and many other useful compounds have been proposed as antibiotics having both anti tumor and anti microbial activities. However, lots more useful compounds must be provided for the purpose of controlling a wide spectrum of cancers. While several compounds have been proposed and made known with a view to attaining this object, the substance PR 1350 Clerocidin has physicochemical properties closely resembling those of the antibiotic MF 720 N6 according to the present invention see, for example, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 465 468, 1984 . This substance PR 1350 belongs to the family of oxidized diterpenes and is considered to be a complex wherein a monomer containing hydroxyaldehyde of formula I and hemiacetal of formula II is in equilibrium with a dimer of formula III as shown below As mentioned above, the prior art has offered many antibiotics of a new family that have both anti tumor and anti microbial activities. However, in view of the many types of cancers known today, the demand for the provision of new anti tumor substances will continue for many years to come. Now, it has been found that the novel antibiotic MF 730 N6 has strong anti tumor acitivities both The antibiotic MF 730 N6 in accordance with the present invention is characterized by the following physicochemical and biological properties The antibiotic MF 730 N6, like the known PR 1350 substance, is considered to be a complex of tautometric isomers, and hence, will present different physicochemical properties depending upon the conditions of measurement and the method of preparing samples. The physicochemical properties of MF 730 N6 described below are those of a white powder prepared by the method described in Example 1 given later in this specification. To a solution of 30 mg of a crude product of MF 730 N6 in 50 mℓ of anhydrous benzene, 100 mg of carbomethoxymethylene triphenyl phosphoran was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was passed through a column 15 mm x 240 mm packed with 30 g of silica gel and the adsorbed mixture was eluted with a mixed solvent of benzene and ethyl acetate 10 1 . The active fractions were collected and purified by passage through a column 20 mm x 350 mm packed with Sephadex LH 20 100 mℓ , followed by elution with a mixed solvent of ethyl acetate and methanol 2 1 . By these procedures, 125 mg of a 3 1 equilibrium mixture of adducts ¹H NMR CDCℓ₃ δ 0.84 3H, s Ten milligrams of a mixture of adducts The antibiotic MF 730 N6 characterized above can be produced with advantage by the following process in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention An antibiotic MF 730 N6 producing microorganism is cultured on a nutrient medium and the desired antibiotic is recovered from the culture. The microorganism used in the process of the present invention may be of any genus and species that has the ability to produce the antibiotic MF 730 N6. An advantageous example is actinomycete MF 730 N6 that is a microorganism of the genus The microorganism may be cultured with any nutrient sources that are commonly used in cultivation of actinomycetes such as carbohydrates, nitrogen sources, inorganic salts and other assimilable sources. Usable carbon sources include carbohydrates such as glucose, glycerin, maltose, sucrose, molasses, dextrin and starch, and fats and oils such as soybean oil and peanut oil. Usable nitrogen sources include peptone, meat extract, cottonseed powder, soybean powder, yeast extract, casein, corn steep liquor, NZ amine, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride. Usable inorganic salts include dipotassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate and manganese chloride. If necessary, trace metals such as cobalt and iron may be added. Any other known nutrient sources that can be utilized by the MF 730 N6 producing microorganism for production of the desired antibiotic may be used. The proportions of the nutrient sources illustrated above are not limited to any particular values and may be varied over a broad range. The nutrient sources optimum for the growth of the antibiotic MF 730 N6 producing microorganism used and the proportions of the specific sources may be readily determined by those skilled in the art on the basis of a simple small scale experimentation. The nutrient medium containing the nutrient sources listed above may be sterilized prior to cultivation. It is advantageous that the pH of the medium is adjusted to the range of 6 8, especially 6.5 7.5, either prior to or following the sterilization. Cultivation of the antibiotic MF 730 N6 producing microorganism on the nutrient medium may be carried out in accordance with any of the methods commonly used in the production of antibiotics from actinomycetes. Cultivation under aerobic conditions is generally advantageous, and it may be accompanied by agitation and or aeration. Stationary culture, shake culture or submerged culture with aeration and agitation may be employed, and submerged culture is suitable for mass production of the antibiotic MF 730 N6. The cultivation temperature is not limited to any particular value so long as it is within the range that permits substantial growth of the antibiotic MF 730 N6 producing microorganism so as to ensure production of the intended antibiotic. While a suitable cultivation temperature can be selected depending upon the MF 730 N6 producing microorganism used, a particularly preferred temperature is within the range of 25 30 C. The cultivation may be continued until substantial accumulation of the intended antibiotic MF 730 N6 occurs. The cultivation time will vary with the composition of the medium, the cultivation temperature, ambient temperature or the bacterial strain used. Usually, a cultivation for 12 24 hours is sufficient for obtaining the desired antibiotic. The amount of antibiotic MF 730 N6 accumulated in the culture may be determined with pneumobacillus strain KP PCI 606 by the cylinder plate process conventionally employed in antibiotic determinations. The antibiotic MF 730 N6 thus accumulated in the culture may be recovered in the isolated and pure form by subjecting the filtrate of culture or supernatant either to solvent extraction with the aid of a suitable organic solvent or to chromatography by means of adsorption or ion exchange , used independently or in combination. The filtrate or supernatant of culture free from the cells may be obtained by a known separating method such as filtration or centrifugation. Organic solvents that can be used in the extraction technique include chloroform, ethyl acetate and any other solvents that are capable of dissolving the antibiotic MF 730 N6 and which are substantially insoluble in water. Examples of the chromatographic carrier having adsorptive or ion exchanging abilities include activated carbon, silica gel porous polystyrene divinylbenzene resin, and many other ion exchange resins. By employing the procedures described above, the antibiotic MF 730 N6 having the already specified characteristics is obtained. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the advantages of the present invention. Actinomycetes strain MF 730 N6 FERM P No. 8247, transmitted to FERM BP 1045 was cultured on an agar slant medium. A liquid medium 500 mℓ, pH 7.2 containing 1 glucose and 1 yeast extract was poured into two flasks in amounts of 110 mℓ and routinely sterilized at 120 C for 20 minutes. Each of the sterilized mediums was inoculated with the cultured cells of MF 730 N6 and subjected to rotary shake culture 180 rpm at 27 C for 48 hours so as to prepare a seed culture solution. The seed culture solution 110 mℓ was transferred into a 30 ℓ jar fermenter containing 15 liters of an MF 730 N6 producing medium for its composition, see below and subjected to cultivation for 30 hours at 27 C and 150 rpm while air was supplied at a rate of 15 liters per minute. While the cultivation was continuing, a few drops of Silicone KM 75 tradename of Shinetsu Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. for an anti foaming agent were applied to the medium. A culture solution prepared in two units of the jar fermenter was suction filtered using a filtration aid to obtain 24 liters of a culture filtrate in the following pages, material balances are shown on the assumption that 1 mℓ of the filtrate has an antibacterial activity of 1 U against the pneumobacillus strain KP PCI 606 . The filtrate was adjusted to a pH of 5.0 and subject to two extractions with 12 liters of chloroform total activity of the extract 15,000 U T . The extract was concentrated to a volume of 1 liter under vacuum. The concentrate was dehydrated with Glauber s salt and after filtration, discolored with 0.5 activated carbon. After filtering off the activated carbon, the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The concentrate was subjected to silica gel chromatography 3.5 cm x 11 cm , followed by elution with a mixed solvent of chloroform methanol 100 3 . The collected active fractions were concentrated under vacuum, and the concentrate was subjected to column chromatography 3.5 cm x 11 cm using Diaion HP 20 trademark of Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Limited and eluted by a linear density gradient of 50 aqueous methanol to 100 methanol. The active fractions were collected, freed of methanol under vacuum, and freeze dried to obtain 108mg of a pale yellow powder 6,500 U T . This powder was subjected to reverse phase TLC developed with a mixed solvent of acetonitrile water 7 3 . The collected active fractions were subjected to extraction with methanol to obtain 39mg 5460 U T of the pure form of antibiotic MF 730 N6. This material is characterized by the physicochemical properties already described.
