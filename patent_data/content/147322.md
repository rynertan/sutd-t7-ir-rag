# Method for forming a pattern having a fine gap.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed of forming a fine pattern on a substrate 1 , in which an etching mask pattern B is formed on a layer of material A of a pattern to be formed, an overlying layer C is deposited on a pattern material layer A and the mask pattern B , and thereafter, the overlying layer and the pattern material layer are etched by ion etching. This method makes it possible, due to the pattern widening effect caused by the deposition of the overlying layer and by ion etching, to form a pattern having a gap smaller than 0.5 um or a continuous disk pattern having a period of 2 um or less by photolithography having a 1 um resolution. It is also possible to form a pattern adapted to enable an easy planing process, by utilizing the difference in etching rate between the mask pattern and the overlying layer. An apparatus used for carrying out the pattern forming method comprises film layer forming means and ion etching means, whereby the overlying layer forming step and the ion etching step can be successively performed by using one and the same apparatus.
