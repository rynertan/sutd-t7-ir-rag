# CRANKSHAFT POSITION TRANSDUCER SYSTEM

## Abstract
This invention relates to a crankshaft positions transducer system for providing triggering pulses for an electronic ignition system. In a known system used with an internal combustion engine a single reference projection is mounted on the flywheel and a pair of transducers are mounted at circumferentially spaced locations on the flywheel housing. This is inconvenient as space inside the flywheel housing is limited. In the present invention a pair of reference elements 34 are mounted at circumferentially and radially spaced locations on the flywheel 16 and a transducer head having two individual transducers 22, 24 is provided, each individual transducer 22, 24 co operating with a respective one of the reference elements 34 to produce a triggering pulse.
