# Method of detecting flaws on surfaces.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved method for scan ning for flaws on a surface 5 utilizing a novel dynamic averaging signal correction technique. Each individual scan signal is divided into a large number of samples, each sam ple representing a predetermined position in the scan. A dynamic average is computed for each of the scan positions by averaging samples from the same position of a predeter mined number of previously derived scan signals. Each time a new scan line is scanned and divided into samples, each sample is compared with its corresponding dynamic average to provide a signal indicative of surface condition. This technique is especially useful to detect flaws on high quality tubing, such as used for nuclear reactor fuel rods or for nuclear reactor steam generator tubing.
