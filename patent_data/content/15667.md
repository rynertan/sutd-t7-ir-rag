# Expansion joint sealing assembly and method for its installation.

## Abstract
A sealing assembly for sealing the expansion gap bet ween adjacent sectons of a structure has elongated elasto meric pads 2, 24 laid end to end along the length of the gap with a groove 6 in at least one of the end surfaces 4 of each pad for containing a flowable sealant in Fig. 7 the abutting end surfaces of the pad are shown spaced apart for clarity . In order to achieve a seal which satisfactorily prevents access of debris and liquid into the expansion gap, while being easily formed after the pads are mounted in place, the groove has an inlet port at the top edge of the end sur face through which the flowable sealant may be injected e.g. from a container 48 . an intermediate sealing portion 12 for housing the sealant 46 to prevent debris and liquid from passing between the end faces, and a vent por tion 22 communicating between the intermediate seal ing portion 12 and the top edge of the end surface 4 , so that sealant emerging from the top of the vent portion will indicate that the intermediate sealing portion has been filled. The other pad 24 may have a tongue which pro jects into, but does not fill, the groove 6 , or may have a groove corresponding and opposed to the groove 6 . The sealing portion 12 includes a length at the bottom edge of the endface 4 , at which the sealant contacts the struc ture section.
