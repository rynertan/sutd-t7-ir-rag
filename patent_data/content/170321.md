# Noise detector.

## Abstract
Noise detector for detecting noise pulses in a non limited radio receiving signal modulated on a carrier, comprising an amplitude detection circuit 20 and a signal comparison arrangement 23 , this signal comparison arrangement 23 producing a detection signal when its input signal exceeds a threshold level which varies with the average input level of the noise detection i.e. the average field strength. A noise selection being adapted to the human ear and based on the ratio between the noise pulse amplitude and the average input level is realized by means of a logarithmic level detection circuit 18 . The logarithmic conversion therein renders a simple setting of the value of ratio possible, and realizes a dynamic compression.
