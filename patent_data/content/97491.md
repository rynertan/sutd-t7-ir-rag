# Range azimuth angle ship imaging for ordnance control.

## Abstract
Distortions inherent in the formation of a range doppler image by an airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR of a ship under the influence of roll, pitch, and yaw motions characteristic of sea state conditions, are removed by the formation of a scaled range azimuth angle image generated with the use of an interferometer antenna in conjunction with the SAR. A least squares linear regression solution to doppler processed interferometric azimuth angle data de rived from ship radar reflections permits the determination of aircraft to ship relative rotational motion essential to the development of such an improved high resolution radar image, so that continuous automatic tracking of a cursor imbedded in a single designated resolution cell of the ship s displayed image essential to carrying out precision standoff command weapon guidance to that selected ship target cell, can be accomplished.
