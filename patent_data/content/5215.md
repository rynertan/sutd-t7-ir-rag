# Process for polymerizing olefins.

## Abstract
An olefin or mixture of olefins is polymerized in a hydrocarbon diluent in a turbulent reaction zone to produce particles of polymer which are substantially insoluble in the diluent particle form process . Fouling of the reactor by adherence of polymer particles to the walls of the reactor is reduced by adding to the reaction medium a composition which comprises a mixture of a a polysulfone copolymer, b a polymeric polyamine, and c an oilsoluble sulfonic acid.
