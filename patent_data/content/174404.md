# Cassette for sheets.

## Abstract
A cassette 5 is disclosed that allows the extraction of sheets in either a short edge or long edge direction. The cassette 15 has openings 6a on the short edge and long edge of its base and adjacent sides to apply an upward force from below through one of the apertures 6a so that, depending on the direction in which the cassette 5 is inserted into a sheet using machine, the sheets can be inclined and extracted in either of two orthogonal directions.
