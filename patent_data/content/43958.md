# POWER SENSING IN A MICROWAVE OVEN

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for power sensing in a micro wave oven. A signal proportional to the voltage across the primary of the high voltage transformer and a signal proportional to the current through the primary are multi plied together by a four quadrant analog multiplier. The output of the multiplier is integrated for a predetermined number of line cycles The integrated value is then converted to a digital value representative of power.
