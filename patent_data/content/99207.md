# Agents for preparing cross linked polymers and polymerisable compositions and water based paint products containing such agents.

## Abstract
A class of polymer precursor materials, which, under appropriate conditions, react to form cross linked polymers, is disclosed. These materials contain a backbone segment, preferably a polyacrylate, and have pendant therefrom 1 reactive mono or disubstituted olefinic groups, such as vinyl or allyl itaconate, and 2 water solubilizing groups, such as the half ester of maleic acid. This class of materials, especially when combined with specifically defined oxygen activated catalyst systems, provides water based paint com positions which exhibit film formation, strength and durabil ity characteristics comparable to those of the best solvent based paint formulations.
