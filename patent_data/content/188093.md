# Sandwich immunoassay.

## Abstract
An immunoassay system for determining the amount of a polyvalent ligand in a liquid test sample is based on a an insoluble phase to which is bound a separation specific binding substance which does not bind the ligand b a capture specific binding substance which specifically binds the ligand, and which is itself specifically bound by the separation specific binding substance and c a probe specific binding substance which specifically binds the ligand at a site which is accessible when the ligand is bound to the capture specific binding substance, the probe specific binding substance being not substantially bound by the separation specific binding substance, and being detectable by at least one detection procedure.
