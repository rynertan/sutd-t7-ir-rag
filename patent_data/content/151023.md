## Description
This invention relates to electronic control apparatus and, more particularly, to novel and highly effective apparatus for controlling the power supply to electronic circuitry such as a television receiver. It is common in many countries to equip a television receiver with a remote controller. To facilitate remote control, the television receiver incorporates a microcomputer powered selectively by a main power supply or a standby backup power supply. Despite the provision of a standby power supply, power interruptions can occur that, though too brief to be detected by the unaided senses, are capable nevertheless of placing the microcomputer in an abnormal operating state. Various proposals in the prior art for remedying this problem have proved unsatisfactory because of increased manufacturing expense and inconvenience to users. An example of a prior apparatus, corresponding to the precharacterising part of claim 1 is disclosed in EP A 0027432. An object of the invention is to provide improved apparatus for controlling the power supply to electronic circuitry such as a television receiver. Another object of the invention is to provide improved apparatus that can normalise the operation of an abnormally operating control microcomputer. It is a further object of the invention to provide improved apparatus for controlling the power supply to electronic circuitry including a television receiver that is controlled by a remote controller. According to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for controlling the supply of power to electronic circuitry a switched power supply for connection to said electronic circuitry switch means enabling said switched power supply selectively to energise or de energise said electronic circuitry a nominally continuous power supply reset signal generating means for generating a reset signal in response to a rising edge of an output voltage of said nominally continuous power supply following an interruption of said output voltage memory means for memorising the condition of said switch means and producing a memory output signal in response thereto and means for controlling the operation of said electronic circuitry in dependence on said memory output signal when said reset signal generating means is actuated said apparatus being characterised in that the switch means and the controlling means comprise automatic switch means enabling said switched power supply selectively to energise or de energise said electronic circuitry power switch means switching circuit control means connected to said automatic switch means, the memory means being connected to said switching circuit control means for memorising the condition thereof and producing a memory output signal in response thereto detecting means for detecting the condition of said power switch means and producing a detector output signal in response thereto and reset means actuated by said reset signal said switching circuit control means being connected to said reset means, said memory means and said detecting means and being arranged to generate a control signal for controlling the operation of said automatic switch means in joint dependence on said memory output signal and said detector output signal when said reset means is actuated. A better understanding of the features and advantages of the invention can be gained from a consideration of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof, in conjunction with the appended drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a circuit block diagram of conventional apparatus for controlling the power supply to electronic circuitry Fig. 2 is a circuit block diagram showing in broad outline a preferred embodiment of apparatus according to the invention for controlling the power supply to electronic circuitry Fig. 3 is a circuit block diagram showing in greater detail a preferred embodiment of apparatus according to the invention Fig. 4 is a flow chart of a program which is executed by a microcomputer in accordance with the invention and Fig. 5 is a flow chart of a modification of the program shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 1 shows a television receiver When the remote controller In such a television receiver, the microcomputer In the prior art, in order to deal with these problems, various proposals have been made, including the following the characteristics of the power supply are improved so as to prevent the power supply voltage supplied to the microcomputer Therefore, in order that, when the microcomputer However, this technique requires the provision of an additional switch the master switch MSW , and this causes an increase in cost that can not be neglected. Figs. 2 5 show apparatus according to the invention for controlling the power supply to electronic circuitry. Fig. 2 is a circuit block diagram showing the apparatus broadly. In Fig. 2, a microcomputer A controls circuitry B by means of a controller C incorporated in the microcomputer A. A power supply D which is nominally continuous but which can be interrupted by pulling an AC plug or by various malfunctions supplies power to the microcomputer A, and a switched power supply E supplies power to the controlled circuitry B. Ideally, the nominally continuous power supply D is always supplied with commercial electrical power house current when the plug of an AC cord is properly inserted into a live socket. As indicated below, commercial electrical service may be interrupted so that the power supply D does not in fact operate continuously. The switched power supply E for the controlled circuitry B is selectively supplied with commercial electrical power house current through a make break switch F. The switch F is controlled by an automatic switching circuit G, and the automatic switching circuit G is in turn controlled by a switching circuit controller H incorporated in the microcomputer A. The switched power supply E is turned on, namely placed in the state to produce a power supply voltage, or turned off, namely placed in the state not to produce a power supply voltage, by the microcomputer A and, more particularly, by the switching circuit controller H thereof. A power switch I of non latching type is provided for causing the microcomputer A to change the on or off condition of the switched power supply E. A rising level voltage detector J receives the power supply voltage derived from the nominally continuous power supply D and detects the rising edge of this voltage upon restoration of service after a service interruption, regardless of whether the service interruption is instantaneous or of extended duration. When the rising edge of the power supply voltage is thus detected, the rising level voltage detector J produces a pulse signal. A time constant signal generator K generates a reset signal of a predetermined pulse width in response to actuation of the rising level voltage detector J or the power switch I. The rising level voltage detector J and time constant signal generator K together constitute a reset signal generator R. Detecting means L in the microcomputer A detects the condition of the power switch I, namely whether the power switch I is in the on or off state. Reset means M is actuated and resets the microcomputer A itself when the reset signal is produced by the reset signal generator R, whereby the program of the microcomputer A disclosed below in connection with Figs. 4 and 5 is restarted from its beginning. A memory N memorizes the switching condition of the switching circuit controller H. The memory N is nonvolatile so that it continues to memorize, even upon an interruption of electrical power, the output contents of the switching circuit controller H prior to such interruption. The switching circuit controller H is jointly responsive to the content of the memory N and the output of the detector L in order to control the automatic switch means comprising the make break switch F and the switching circuit G. More specifically, when the microcomputer A is reset, if the memorized contents of the memory N indicate that the switched power supply E for the controlled circuitry B was last in the on state, the power supply E for the circuitry B is switched to the state opposite to that of the power switch I. In other words, if the power switch I is turned on, the switched power supply E is turned off, while if the power switch I is turned off, the switched power supply E is turned on. Similarly, after the microcomputer A is reset, if the memorized contents of the memory N indicate that the power supply was last in the off state, the switched power supply E for the controlled circuitry B is switched to the same state as that of the power switch I. In other words, if the power switch I is on, the switched power supply E is turned on, while if the power switch I is off, the switched power supply E is turned off. Fig. 3 illustrates apparatus according to the invention in greater detail. In Fig. 3, a microcomputer 1 controls a television receiver 2 and comprises a central processing unit CPU 3, a read only memory ROM 4, a random access memory RAM 5, and a nonvolatile memory 6 which memorizes the on or off condition of the switched power supply 16 for the television receiver 2. An input port I P 7 receives a switching signal from a power supply key PKY that is provided in, for example, the front panel of the housing not shown of the television receiver 2. An input port I P 8 receives a signal from a light detector 17 incorporating a photo diode PD which responds to an infrared signal from a remote controller 18. An input port I P 9 receives various other signals from sources not illustrated. An output port O P 10 supplies a tuning signal to a phase locked loop PLL circuit 11 incorporated in the television receiver 2. The tuning signal from the O P 10 is supplied through the PLL circuit 11 to a tuner 12 that tunes in a broadcast electromagnetic signal corresponding to the tuning signal so that the broadcast signal is reproduced by a reproducing circuit 13 and then supplied to a cathode ray tube CRT and a speaker SP. An output port O P 14 produces a control signal which is supplied through a resistor R1 to the base of an NPN transistor Q of which the emitter is grounded. The collector of the transistor Q is connected through a relay RL to a power terminal of a nominally continuous power supply 15 for the microcomputer 1. A make break switch contact RLC of the relay RL is interposed in a circuit which supplies commercial power from the continuous power supply 15 to a switched power supply 16. The switched power supply 16 provides power to the television receiver 2. The continuous power supply 15 for the microcomputer 1 is connected in parallel to an AC plug. There are no switches between the power supply 15 and the AC plug and, in the absence of a malfunction, the power supply voltage is therefore available at all times when the plug is properly inserted into a live socket. When the photo diode PD senses a remote control signal of infrared rays i.e. of electromagnetic radiation having a principal frequency component in the infrared region of the spectrum emitted from the remote controller 18, the light detecting circuit 17 supplies the remote control signal thus sensed to the I P 8. The ROM 4, RAM 5, memory 6, I P s 7, 8 and 9 and O P s 10 and 14 are all connected to the CPU 3 by a two way bus B . A rising level voltage detector 19 detects the rising edge of the power supply voltage after a service interruption and produces a pulse signal in response thereto. The pulse signal is supplied through a resistor R2 to an input terminal T of the CPU 3 in order to reset the microcomputer 1 and to one side of a capacitor C₀. The side of the capacitor C₀ opposite the resistor R2 is connected to one terminal of the power key PKY. The other terminal of the power key PKY is connected to ground. A resistor R3 is connected between the connection point of the power key PKY and the capacitor C₀ and the power terminal of the continuous power supply 15 for the microcomputer 1. During a period when the power key PKY is depressed or actuated, the switching signal supplied to the I P 7 is held in a low level L , since the input terminal of the I P 7 is then grounded through the power key PKY. Each time the switching signal of level L is supplied to the I P 7, the level of the switching signal delivered from the O P 14 is inverted from L to a high level H or from H to L . At the same time, because of the grounding of the capacitor C₀ through the power key PKY, the terminal T of the microcomputer 1 is held at the L level during a period the length of which is determined by the time constant of the RC circuitry R2 C₀ described above, which constitutes a time constant signal generator. The time constant signal generator and the rising level voltage detector 19 together constitute a reset signal generator. The period during which the terminal T is held at the L level is selected to be long enough that the microcomputer 1 is completely reset. In other words, not only when the restoration of power is detected by the rising level voltage detector 19 but also when the power key PKY is actuated, the microcomputer 1 is reliably placed in the reset state. The operation for turning on and off the switched power supply E Fig. 2 or 16 Fig. 3 for the controlled electronic circuitry B or television receiver 2 is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 is a flow chart of a subroutine in a program executed by the microcomputer A Fig. 2 or 1 Fig. 3 , but for simplicity the legends in Fig. 4 refer only to Fig. 3. This subroutine begins with step 20 whenever the microcomputer A or 1 is reset. The microcomputer A or 1 is reset whenever the rising level voltage detector J or 19 generates a pulse signal or the power key I or PKY is depressed. The pulse signal is generated whenever voltage from the power supply D or 15 rises up upon proper insertion of the AC plug into a live socket or upon restoration of service following an instantaneous or prolonged interruption of service . At step 21, the contents of the nonvolatile memory N Fig. 2 or 6 Fig. 3 are read out. These contents register the on or off condition of the switched power supply E or 16 prior to the reset of the program subroutine to step 20. In other words, the nonvolatile memory N or 6 memorizes the on or off condition of the switched power supply E or 16, and even if a service interruption occurs, the memorized contents of the nonvolatile memory N or 6 are not lost. Accordingly, in the case of a service interruption, the on or off condition of the switched power supply E or 16 prior to the service interruption can be judged by reading out the contents of the nonvolatile memory N or 6. At step 22 a determination is made based on the contents of the memory N or 6 as read out at step 21 whether the switched power supply E or 16 was previously on. At step 23 or 23 a determination is made whether or not the power key I Fig. 2 or PKY Fig. 3 is now depressed. Step 23 is executed when the determination made at step 22 is YES , while step 23 is executed when the determination made at step 22 is NO . At step 24 the power supply E or 16 is turned on. Specifically, when the determination NO is made at step 23, a control signal is derived from the switching circuit controller H Fig. 2 to control the operation of the automatic switch means comprising the switching circuit G and the make break switch F or is derived from the O P 14 Fig. 3 to control the operation of the automatic switch means comprising the resistor R1, transistor Q, relay coil RL, and contact RLC. Specifically, in the case of Fig. 3, when the signal from the O P 14 turns on the transistor Q, the relay coil RL is energized by the power supply 15 so that the contact piece RLC closes and commercial AC current is supplied to the switched power supply E or 16, turning it on. Accordingly, the television receiver 2 is also turned on. At step 25 the switched power supply E or 16 is turned off. Specifically, when the determination YES is made at step 23, no switching signal is derived from the switching circuit controller H or O P 14. As a result, the switched power supply E or 16 is supplied with no commercial AC current and hence is placed in the off state so that the controlled circuitry B or television receiver 2 is also turned off. When the determination NO is made at step 23 , the same operation of turning off the switched power supply E or 16 as at step 25 is carried out at step 26. When the determination YES is made at step 23 , the same operation of turning on the switched power supply E or 16 as at step 24 is carried out. At step 28 the output of the switching circuit controller H or O P 14 is sampled. When whichever one of steps 24 to 27 selected by the subroutine to be performed is ended, the on or off condition of the switched power supply E or 16 at present is therefore detected. Practically, this detection is carried out by sampling the output of the switching circuit controller H or O P 14 i.e., detecting whether or not the switching signal is produced. At step 29 a determination is made whether or not the switched power supply E or 16 at present is turned on. If the determination made at step 29 is YES , then, at step 30 the on state of the switched power supply E or 16 is recorded in the nonvolatile memory N or 6. If the determination made at step 29 is NO , then, at step 31 the off state of the switched power supply E or 16 is recorded in the nonvolatile memory N or 6. When the power supply voltage rises up after the end of a service interruption or the power key I or PKY provided in a panel of the housing of the controlled circuitry B or television receiver 2 is depressed or actuated, the microcomputer A or 1 is placed in the reset state. When the microcomputer A or 1 is reset by the rising up of the power supply voltage, so long as the power key I or PKY is not depressed, the switched power supply E or 16 is operated to return the controlled circuitry B or television receiver 2 to its on or off state as it existed just before the service interruption. However, when the power key I or PKY is depressed while the power supply E or 16 and controlled circuitry B or television receiver 2 are turned on, the switched power supply E or 16 and the controlled circuitry B or television receiver 2 are turned off. Alternatively, when the microcomputer A or 1 is reset by the operation of the power key I or PKY, the switched power supply E or 16 is turned on if it was previously off and is turned off if it was previously on. Consequently, regardless of whether or not the service interruption is a momentary one, the microcomputer A or 1 is automatically reset immediately after the end of the service interruption. Furthermore, even if abnormal operation of the microcomputer A or 1 should occur for any reason, normal operation can be restored by use of the power key I or PKY. Fig. 5 is a flow chart of a modified program for the microcomputer A or 1. This program is different from the program shown in Fig. 4 only in that the sequential order of determining whether or not the power supply E or 16 was previously turned on, and determining whether or not the power key I or PKY is now depressed, is reversed. Thus at step 23a in Fig. 5 a determination is made whether or not the power key I or PKY is now depressed. At step 22a or 22a a determination is made based on the contents of the memory N or 6 as read out at step 21 whether the switched power supply E or 16 was previously on. Step 22a is executed when the determination made at step 23a is YES , while step 22a is executed when the determination made at step 23a is NO . Accordingly, both of the programs shown in figures 4 and 5 serve the same ultimate purposes. As set forth above, according to this invention, should the microcomputer A or 1 fall into an abnormal operating state, it can be reset by operating the power supply switch I or PKY. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide a separate master switch MSW figure 1 for turning off the switched power supply E or 16 in order to reset the microcomputer, nor is it necessary to remove the AC plug and reinsert it. From the description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is apparent that many modifications and variations can be effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
