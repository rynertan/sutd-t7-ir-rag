# Low noise amplifier circuit.

## Abstract
Transistor 4 of the amplifier, which is in a grounded emitter configuration, has a parallel feedback loop circuit of impedance Z The amplifier offers a constant input impedance over a wide frequency band, a gain which is higher at high frequen cies and a good overload characteristic.
