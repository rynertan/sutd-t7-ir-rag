# Disposable surgical stapler for performing anastomosis.

## Abstract
A disposable surgical stapler comprising a tubular housing 12 a tubular pusher axially located within the bore of said housing, said pusher having an axial slot extending through its tubular wall, a central rod 18 axially located within said pusher, said central rod having an axial groove in its lateral surface, a handle 24 pivotally mounted on the tubular wall of said housing 12 . A second part of said handle being located on the other side of the pivotal mounting, adjacent to said housing, and being positioned within a slot in said housing and within the slot in said pusher. The second part of said handle being adapted to move distally against the distal end of the slot in said pusher to move said pusher distally within the bore of said housing. The end of the second part of said handle, being remote from the pivotal mounting, being spaced from the pivotal mounting by a distance greater than the lateral distance between the pivotal mounting and the lateral sur face of said centre rod 18 , means for determining that the axial position of the distal end of said central rod relative to the distal end of said housing is such that an anvil 20 and a staple carrying assembly 22 are properly spaced apart for fastening tissue between them. The groove in said central rod 18 being located so that when said anvil 20 and said staple carrying assembly 22 are properly spaced apart for fastening tissue between them, 1 at least a portion of the slot in said pusher is laterally aligned with at least a portion of the groove in said central rod, and that 2 the end of the second part of said handle, remote from the pivotal mounting, can move medially and distally into the groove of said central rod.
