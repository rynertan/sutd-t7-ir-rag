# Process for stabilising potential plasmid vectors and novel plasmids.

## Abstract
An unstable potential plasmid vector, e.g. a dual plasmid vector, in a naive host can be stabilised by identifying, and then eliminating, the instability region of the vector. In this way, novel recombinant plasmids pUC1026 and pUC1027 are obtained by covalent linkage of the E. coli plasmid pBR322 to the Streptomyces espinosus plasmid pUC6. These plasmids are useful as cloning vehicles in recombinant DNA work. For example, using DNA methodology, a desired gene, e.g. the insulin gene, can be inserted into the plasmids and the resulting plasmids can then be transformed into a suitable host microbe which, upon culturing, produces the desired insulin.
