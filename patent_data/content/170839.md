# A Mixture of diastereoisomer compounds, as obtained from 5 1 hydroxy 1 methylethyl 2 methyl 2 cyclohexene 1 one, having mucose cretolytic activity, a process for its preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing the same.

## Abstract
The object of the present invention are the following diastereoisomer compounds as derived from 5 1 hy droxy 1 methylethyl 2 methyl 2 cyclohexene 1 one I 1 S 5 R 5 hydroxy α,α 4,5 tetramethyl 3 cyclohex ene 1 methanol CO 1516 II 1 S 5 S 5 hydroxy α,α 4,5 tetramethyl 3 cyclohex ene 1 methanol CO 1517 which can be separated from the mixture of I II at the proportion of 44.44 55.55 said mixture will be hereinafter also designated either by the code CO 1483 or by III . This invention provides, furthermore, the process for obtaining the mixture III CO 1483 by reaction of 5 1 hydroxy 1 methylethyl 2 methyl 2 cyclohexene 1 one with methyl lithium and for separating the diastereoisomers I and II by a chromatographic method. Finally, the present invention comprises pharmaceuti cal compositions which contain the compounds I , II and the mixture III , when possess a pharmacologic mucose cretolytic activity.
