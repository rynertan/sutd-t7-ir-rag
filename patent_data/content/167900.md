# Pressure sensitive recording material.

## Abstract
A pressure sensitive recording material of the type which is prepared by using an electron donating dye precursor that produces a color when the dye precursor is brought into contact with an electron accepting color developer. The pressure sensitive recording material is characterized in that the solvent for said dye precursor comprises an alkylated fraction which is prepared by alkylat ing a by product fraction with at least one alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, the by product fraction containing the components within the boiling range of 255 to 300 C on the atmospheric pressure basis and being obtained in the process for producing ethylbenzene or ethyltoluene from ethylene and benzene or toluene. The pressure sensitive recording material of the invention has scarcely offensive odor and can develop a dense color with a higher color developing rate.
