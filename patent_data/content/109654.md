# Method of and device for splitting a metal circle with an asymmetrical splitting wheel.

## Abstract
For splitting a metal circle, a splitting wheel 2 having an asymmetrical edge 4, 5 causes the metal circle to be pressed to one side. The forces of this side pressure are absorbed by a supporting wheel 3 fitted in the same tool holder 6 as the splitting wheel. This device simplifies the auxiliary equipment for posi tioning the circle during splitting, and further saves work and material.
