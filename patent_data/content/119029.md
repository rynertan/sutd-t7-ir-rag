# VENTED SCREW PUMP FOR THERMOPLASTIC POLYMERS

## Abstract
An improved vented screw pump and process are provided for venting and pumping molten thermoplastic polymers such as nylon 6,6 by which the extent of polymer degradation and gel formation is greatly reduced. The vented screw pump is characterised by the combination of an annular channel 13, 14 through which molten polymer is fed into a vent chamber 6 and whereby the molten polymer is caused to flow as an annular film down the wall of the vent chamber and a screw 2 located below the vent chamber, the vent chamber 6 being provided with wiper 15 to wipe the molten polymer from the wall of the vent chamber 6 . Preferably the screw 2 is operated in a vertical position, is driven from its lower end and has the wiper 15 mounted on its upper end.
