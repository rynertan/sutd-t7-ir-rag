# Illuminated mirror assembly.

## Abstract
A mirror assembly comprising a shallow dish like hous ing 2 containing at least one pair of elongate conductors 6, 9 15 together defining an electrically conductive seating for at least one electric lamp 5 to be mounted therebetween within the housing 2 , the conductors 6, 9 15 extending within the interior of the housing 2 to terminal connectors 10 , whereby connection to an electrical supply externally of the housing 2 can be effected, a frame or bezel 1 detachably secured around the periphery of the housing 2 and defining a first aperture closed by a mirror 3 facing outwardly of the housing 2 and at least one second aperture containing a lens 4 through which light from the or each lamp 5 , when energised, will be so directed as to illuminate a region in front of the mirror 3 . The mirror 3 is spaced from the interior of the base 22 of the housing 2 and the rear surface 11 of the mirror 3 . At least part of the internal surface 22, 23 of the housing 2 are reflective, whereby light emitted by the lamp or lamps 5 is reflected at least once before passing through the lens or lenses 4 to be directed thereby to said region in front of the outer face of the mirror 4 .
