The addition was accompanied by a mild exotherm. The reaction flask was stoppered, and stirring was continued at ambient temperature. After 1.5 hours, by which time the reaction was judged to be complete by high pressure liquid chromatography, the mixture was filtered. The solid on the filter was washed with small volumes of cold water and then with acetone. After air drying overnight, yield of white powder was 1.13 g 90 , m.p. 350 darkened beginning at about 250 without melting . Satisfactory purity was confirmed by TLC 80 20 2 CHCl₃ methanol H₂O and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography H₂O, C₈ reverse phase .
