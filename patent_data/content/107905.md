# Xerographic copier display panel.

## Abstract
A display for use in conjunction with a copier. The disclosed display comprises two microprocessors 210, 212 for controllably displaying information on a display panel 20 of a xerographic copier 10 . A first microprocessor is primarily responsible for energizing alphanumeric elements to either send messages to the copier user or to prompt the user to interact with the copier. A second display 24 is a liquid crystal display wherein selectively energizable liquid crystal elements corresponding to copier components can be rendered visible under the control of the second micro processor. An overlay pattern 149 can be placed above the liquid crystal display to present to the user in outline form the copier architecture with which he is interacting. This overlay can be changed as the copier configuration is changed. The electronics for controlling the display of alphanumeric allows the utilization of different fonts and or different languages. This flexibility allows the copier to prompt, and or display informaton regarding copier status in various languages without a redesign of the display unit.
