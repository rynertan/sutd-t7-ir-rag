# Dynamic peripheral device address assignment method and unit.

## Abstract
A peripheral device address assignment mechanism requiring no use of plugboards or jumpers. This mechanism enables a host processor 10 to select any desired peri pheral device and set its device address to any desired value at any desired time. This is accomplished by providing each peripheral device control unit N with a loadable device address register 26 for holding the device address assigned to its peripheral device. Each device control unit is further provided with circuitry 30 responsive to the appearance in 28 of a unique I O command on the pro cessor I O bus and to the activation of a unique set of the I O bus data line 31 by the processor for loading into its device address register 26 the desired device address value as supplied thereto by the processor via the I O bus.
