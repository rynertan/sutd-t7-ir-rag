# Electronic treadle.

## Abstract
An electronic treadle 10 for generating an electrical sig nal proportioned to the degree of angular movement of a piv otally mounted treadle plate 14 includes a base 32 having side portions 26, 28 which cooperate with corresponding side members 22, 24 extending from the treadle plate. A pair of stops 76, 78 are carried on one 26 of the side portions which cooperate with a tab 80 movable with the treadle plate 14 to limit the angular movement thereof. Movement of the treadle plate 14 is transmitted to a rotary potentiometer 66 carried on side portion 28 by a shaft 62 and socket 57 con necting the shaft to side member 22 .
