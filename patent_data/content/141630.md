# TOUGH, TRANSPARENT LEAD IONOMERS WITH GREATER THAN 100 NEUTRALIZATION

## Abstract
Ionic direct and graft copolymers of α olefins and α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid are provided using from above 1 to about 3 times the amount of lead salt neces sary to neutralize all of the copolymerized acid. The resulting ionomers contain high levels of lead and are tough, clear and melt processible. Accordingly, they are useful in radiation shields.
