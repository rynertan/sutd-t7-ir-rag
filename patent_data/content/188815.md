## Description
HERBICIDAL COMBINATIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Annual grasses and broad leaved weeds which infest cereal crops represent a major problem in grain production throughout the world. Urea herbicides such as N 3 chloro 4 methylphenyl N,N dimethylurea chior toluron , N,N dimethyl N 4 l methylethyl phenyl urea isoproturon , and N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N dimethylurea metoxuron are currently used in various parts of the world for controlling certain broad leaved weeds and annual grasses in small grains, but do not always provide complete control of all undesirable plant species. Nt 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N di methylurea, metoxuron is a selective herbicide for use in cereals and carrots, particularly against blackgrass, silky bent grass, wild oats, ryegrass, canary grass, and most annual broad leaved weeds. It is applied to winter and some spring wheats, winter barley and winter rye at early post emergence at 2.4 3.2 kg a.i. ha or at late post emergence at 3.2 4.0 kg ha. Most winter wheats, winter barley and winter rye, and some spring wheat varieties show a high tolerance but some damage has occurred on a few varieties. A mixture of methyl 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl m toluate, and 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl p toluate is a new selective post emergence herbicide for cereals which provides excellent control of grasses, such as wild oats Avena spp, , blackgrass Alopecurus myosuroides , and wind grass or silky bentgrass Apera spica venti .It has controlled broadleaved weeds, including wild mustard Brassica kaber or Sinapis arvensis , black bindweed or wild buckwheat Polygonum convolvulus , field pennycress Thlaspi arvense , and wild radish Raphanus raphanistrum . It also has effectively supressed cleavers edstraw Galium spp. , pigweed Amaranthus spp. , kochia Kochia spp. , Tartary buckwheat Fagopyrum tataricum , and Russian thistle Salsola kali . This mixture of imidazolinyl compounds has exhibited tolerance of most varieties of winter and spring wheat and barley. This mixture of compounds, its preparation, and use is disclosed in United StatesPatent 4,188,487 and United States Patent 4,297,128. Cereal crops are most sensitive to competition from weeds in their early stages of growth. The onset of competition is likely to be earliest where large numbers of weeds emerge with the cereal crop. In autumn sown cereals, the grass weeds can be very competitive in the early stages, particularly in crops established by reduced cultivations. The grain from a crop infested with weeds costs more to harvest, clean and dry than grain from a clean crop. Weedy crops take longer to dry which delays and hampers harvesting.The cost of harvesting increases with the total volume of material processed by the combine in relation to the grain recovered. Weeds may increase this volume as well as reducing the quantity of grain by competition.In contrast to the broad leaved weeds, annual grass weeds, particularly in minimum cultivation systems, are fiercely competitive and high levels of control are necessary to reduce the seed burden in the soil.Additionally, the presence of weed seeds in any cereal grain is objectionable. Grass weeds, particularly Lolium multiflorum Italian rye grass and Alopecurus myosuroides Blackgrass have been found to be the source of ergots the fruiting bodies of the fungus Claviceps purpurea which may occur in cereal samples in sufficient quantity to make them unusable until cleaned. Grain which is otherwise suitable for milling may suffer the loss of a quality premium or be refused if it contains more than three per cent of total impurities including weed seeds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is herbicidal compositions of 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2yl m toluate, and methyl 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl 2 toluate and N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N dimethylurea which synergistically control rye grass Lolium , and also provide effective control of a broad spectrum of both broadleaf and grass weeds. The invention also relates to compositions which provide a selective method for the control of rye grass Lolium and undesirable broadleaf and grass plants in cereal crops by application of aqueous compositions comprising a herbicidally effective amount of mixture of 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2yl m toluate, and methyl 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl toluate with N 3 chloro 4 methylphenyl N,N dimethylurea, or N,N dimethyl N 4 l methyl ethyl phenyljurea, or N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,Ndimethylurea to the foliage of said undesirable plant species. It has been found that herbicidal combinations of a mixture of 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl m toluate, and methyl 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl p toluate with the urea herbicides N 3 chloro 4 methylphenyl N,N dimethylurea chlortoluron , N,N dimethyl N 4 l methylethyl phenyl urea isoproturon , and N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N dimethylurea metoxuron are exceedingly effective for the selective control of both broad leaved and annual grasses in cereal crops.Additionally, combinations of a mixture of 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl m toluate, and methyl 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl p toluate with N 3 chloro 4methoxyphenyl N,N dimethylurea metoxuron synergistically controls rye grass Lolium , while providing effective control of a broad spectrum of weeds in cereal crops when applied as a post emergence treatment. In accordance with this invention, the synergistic herbicidal combination comprising methyl, 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazol in 2 yl m toluate, and methyl, 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl g toluate and N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,Ndimethylurea is generally dispersed in water and applied as an aqueous spray to the foliage of undesirable plants. Where desired, a surfactant, spreader, sticker, or the like, can also be added to the solution, and addition of about 0.10 to 0.6 a.i. w v of a surfactant, such as linear alkyl polyoxyethylene ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl and dialkyl phenols and the like to the mixture are generally preferred. The imidazolinone compounds and the N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N dimethylurea may also be individually prepared as wettable powder formulations, emulsifiable concentrates, water miscible concentrates, or the like and mixed in the spray tank in the field. Any of the commercially available urea formulations may, of course, be used. Typical urea formulations which can be used are as follows For effective control of undesirable plants, the synergistic herbicidal combination is normally applied in sufficient amount to provide from about 0.20 kg ha to 1.1 kg ha and preferably 0.20 kg to 0.60 kg ha of a mixture of the imidazolinone compounds, and from about 1.5 to 4.0 kg ha, and preferably 2.0 to 4.0 kg ha, of the N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,N dimethyl urea. The invention is further demonstrated by the examples below, which are presented as illustrative and are not to be considered as limitative. EXAMPLE 1 3 Post emergence applications of methyl 6 4isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazol in 2 yl m toluate and methyl 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl p toluate, and N 3 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl N,Ndimethylurea alone and in combinations with several urea herbicides at the rates illustrated in Table I below are applied to fields sown with wheat, when the weeds have attained the Z 12 14 stage. Sixteen days after treatment the plots are evaluated for per cent control of rye grass in direct comparison to an untreated test plot. The results of these experiments which are summarized in Table II and illustrated graphically inIllustration I below demonstrate the synergistic control of ryegrass Lolium utilizing combinations of methyl 6 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2yl m toluate and methyl 2 4 isopropyl 4 methyl 5 oxo 2 imidazolin 2 yl 2 toluate and N 3 chloro 4 methoxy phenyl N,N dimethylurea.
