# Compressible starches as binders for tablets or capsules.

## Abstract
A compressible starch, useful as a binder for tablets pre pared by direct compression or dry granulation or as a binder diluent for capsules, is prepared by treating a cold water insol uble, granular starch e.g., corn or wacy corn starch with an acid, alkali, and or alpha amylase enzyme at a temperature be low the starch s gelatinization temperature. The treated starch is characterized by altered, weakened granules with a less dense interior and disrupted surface. The compressible starch when admixed with a wet granulation binder e.g., pregelati nized starch is useful as a binder for tablets prepared by wet granulation as well as direct compression or dry granulation or as a binder diluent for capsules.
