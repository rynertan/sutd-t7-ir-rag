# HORIZONTAL CONTINUOUS CASTING MACHINE FOR CASTING MOLTEN METAL INTO PLURALITY OF CAST METAL PIECES.

## Abstract
A horizontal continuous casting machine for casting a plurality of cast metal pieces from a molten metal, consisting of a tundish 1 for receiving a molten metal a plurality of horizontal molds 3 which are coupled separately via the relative horizontal nozzles 2 to a plurality of openings provided in the lower portion of a side wall of the tundish 1 , and which extend in parallel with each other in the same horizontal plane a water cooling means 12 composed of a single jacket 12 for solidifying the molten metal, which is introduced from the tundish 1 into the molds 3 through the nozzles 2 , so as to obtain a plurality of cast metal pieces 7 at least a pair of horizontal pinch rolls 13 composed of upper and lower rolls 13a , 13b and adapted to withdraw the cast metal pieces 7 from the molds 3 simultaneously in the horizontal direction and at least one horizontal guide roller 14 adapted to support and guide the cast metal pieces 7 from the molds 3 toward the pair of pinch rolls 13 simultaneously.
