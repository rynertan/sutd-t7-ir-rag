## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION PROCESS FOR CHIRAL SYNTHESIS OF 1 fl METHYL CARBAPENEM INTERMEDIATESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a chiral process for selectively obtaining high yields of l ss methyl carbapenem intermediates for the subsequent synthesis of l ss methylcarbapenem antibiotics. The process involves introducing an exocyclic a methylene double bond into a bicyclic fi lactam ring structure and then subjecting the compound to hydrogenation conditions with a Group VIII transition metal hydrogenation catalyst which preferentially results in the formation of the l ss methylcarbapenem intermediates. l ss Methylcarbapenems, as described in the reference Heterocycles, 1984, Vol. 21, pp. 29 40 byD. H. Shih, F. Baker, L. Cama and B. G. Christensen, are extremely useful and effective broad spectrum antibiotics, useful against a wide variety of bacteria including Gram positive bacteria includingS. aureus, Strep. sp., B. subtilis, and Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli, Shigella sup., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Proteus, Serratia andPseudomonas sp. A method of synthesizing l ss methylcarba penems is described in the above cited reference in which the beta methyl chirality is introduced into the molecule by base catalyzed alkylation producing a mixture of a and ss epimers which are separated by chromatographic procedures. However, because of the relatively low ss a epimeric ratio obtained by this alkylation route, newer methods for obtaining the desired methyl epimer intermediate on a larger scale are constantly being sought.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found that by introducing an exocyclic a methylene double bond into the secondary ring of a bicyclic fi lactam ring system, and then subjecting said compound to hydrogenation conditions utilizing a Group VIII transition metal hydrogenation catalyst, the stereochemistry of the molecule enables the hydrogenation to proceed stereoselectively to produce the methyl isomer in a fl a epimer ratio greater than 1 and as high as 9 1. In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for stereoselectively reducing an exocyclic methylene double bond in a bicyclic compound of the structural formula I EMI3.1 where R2 is independently H, linear or branchedC1 C3 alkyl, which can be substituted with fluoro or hydroxy, and Y is a divalent bridging protecting group, derived from a ketone, aldehyde or organosilicon compound, said group being stable to catalytic hydrogenation and removable by acid or base hydrolysis, said process comprising the step of contacting said compound with a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a supported or unsupported GroupVIII transition metal hydrogenation catalyst and in the presence of a solvent for said bicyclic compound, at a temperature below the boiling point of the solvent, for a sufficient time to yield a mixture of a and methyl epimers having a fl a molar ratio of greater than 1. The process is illustrated by the following flow diagram EMI3.2 8 epimer a epimer II III Further provided is a composition of the following structural formula, being an intermediate useful in producing compositions of above described structure I EMI4.1 wherein R2 is independently selected from hydrogen, linear or branched C1 C3 alkyl, which can be substituted with fluoro, hydroxy, or protected hydroxy, R3 is hydrogen or a protecting group, X is sulfur or selenium, Q is hydroxymethyl, carboxy orC1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl, and R1 is C1 C4 alkyl, C6 C10 aryl, heteroaryl, which can contain substituents inert under the reaction conditions of forming structures I or IV, and include C1 C4 alkyl, alkoxy, nitro and the like. Furthermore, there is provided a composition of the following structural formula, an intermediate formed from the oxidation of structure IV and, useful in producing composition I EMI4.2 wherein R2 is independently selected from hydrogen, linear or branched C1 C3 alkyl, which can be substituted with fluoro, hydroxy, or protected hydroxy, R3 is hydrogen or a protecting group, R6 is hydrogen, a protecting group, or a covalent bond, and where R6 is a covalent bond, R3 and R6 are joined to form Y, a divalent bridging protecting group derived from a ketone, aldehyde or organosilicon compound, said group being stable to catalytic hydrogenation and removable by acid or base hydrolysis. As described above, where R3 and R6 join to form Y, structure I results. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The basic invention process is best illustrated by reference to the above diagram depicting the hydrogenation of structure I. As is seen, the a exocyclic methylene double bond of I is hydrogenated to produce the methyl epimer II and the a methyl epimer III. The hydrogenation conditions employed are conventional in the art, and it was found surprisingly that the hydrogenation of structure I, particularly where R2 isEMI6.1 gave rise selectively to the methyl epimer in the resulting product mixture which contained a fl a epimer molar ratio of greater than 1. The catalyst employed in the hydrogenation is a conventional Group VIII transition metal hydrogenation catalyst typically used for olefins which can be soluble or insoluble in the reaction medium, but wherein said catalyst is generally not effective for causing hydrogenation of the bicyclic beta lactam ring structure under the hydrogenation conditions. Preferred metals in the catalyst are nickel, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and the metal in the catalyst can be in the form of free metal, salts or compounds thereof. The catalysts can be used in the bulk and unsupported form, e.g. palladium hydroxide, or in the supported form on a suitable substrate, e.g. activated carbon, inorganic sulfate or carbonate, said substrate not intervening in the hydrogenation process.Representative examples ofGroup VIII transition metal hydrogenation catalysts which can be used include palladium hydroxide, platinum oxide, platinum black, platinumon carbon, palladium on carbon, colloidal palladium or platinum, platinum or palladium on barium sulfate or barium carbonate, Raney nickel, i.e. W 2, W 4,W 6, or other grades as prepared by conventional procedures, soluble rhodium catalysts including tris triphenylphosphine chlororhodium, and the like.The catalyst can be soluble in the solvent used, such as the triphenylphosphine rhodium compound, or insoluble, such as the heterogeneous catalysts, eg.Raney Nickel. A preferred catalyst for use in the process is Raney Nickel as produced by the conventional process described in the reference L.F.Feiser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis1, Vol. 1, p. 723 John Wiley Sons, New York , incorporated by reference herein for that purpose. Catalysts operable in the process are produced by conventional procedures. Solvents for Structure I which can be used for the hydrogenation of I in the process should be inert under the reaction conditions and have a boiling point in the temperature range of about 50 1000C for adequate temperature to be achieved during the process. Representative examples of solvents which can be used in the process include protic and aprotic liquids such as C1 C3 alcohols, C3 C6 alkyl carboxylic esters, C4 cyclic mono and diethers, and derivatives thereof, which can contain substituents such as lower alkyl and alkoxy, inert under the hydrogenation conditions. Representative examples include EtOH,MeOH, MeOAc, EtOAc, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and the like. A preferred solvent in the process is EtOH. Concentrations of I in the solvent can range from 0.001 to 1 molar and preferably 0.1 to 1 molar. Temperature employed in the hydrogenation process can range from 780C up to the boiling point of the solvent. The preferred temperature range for conducting the process is about 0 to 250C. Pressure employed in the process can be anywhere from one atmosphere to several atmospheres suitable for standard olefin reduction conditions.Preferred is a pressure of about 0 40 psig and particularly about 40 psig, containing a substantially hydrogen atmosphere. The hydrogen atmosphere can of course contain other gases which are either reducing or inert under the reaction conditions such as small amounts of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide and the like. Preferably the atmosphere used in the hydrogenation is substantially a hydrogen atmosphere. The time involved in the hydrogenation is that sufficient under the reaction conditions to obtain substantial catalytic hydrogenation of structural formula I to obtain a resulting fl a epimer molar ratio of greater than 1. n a epimer molar ratios of substantially greater than 1 are achieved, being generally 1.5 and above and can approach a ratio of 9 1 via the hydrogenation step. The compounds encompassed by structuralFormula I include those compounds wherein R2 is independently selected from H, linear or branched C1 C3 alkyl, which can be substituted with fluoro, hydroxy or protected hydroxy. The hydroxy protecting groups included herein are known in the antibiotic art, are removable by acid or base hydrolysis, and include, inter alia, trialkylsilicon groups such as t butyldiphenylsilyl, triphenylsilyl, isopropyldimethylsilyl or dimethyl t butylsilyl. A preferred hydroxy protecting silyl group, e.g. t butyldimethylsilyloxy can be formed by reacting the hydroxy group, e.g. l hydroxyethyl, with t butyldimethylsilyl chloride in a dry solvent such as methylene chloride, DMF, or other inert solvents, in the presence of an acid acceptor, e.g.triethylamine or imidazole, at 20 to 250C for a period of 1 2 hours and then isolating and purifying the desired protected hydroxy compound by conventional methods. When desired to remove the protecting group, such as prior to hydrogenation, the protected silyloxy can be treated with fluoride, e.g. with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran in dimethylformamide solvent at room temperature for 1 2 hours. Isolation and purification of the resulting hydroxy compound can be accomplished by conventional procedures. Generally, in the hydrogenation step of the methylene double bond, it is preferred to deblock the hydroxy group when present in R2 prior to the hydrogenation. Representative examples of R2 include H,CH3 , CH3CH2 , CH3 2CH , HOCH2 , CH3CHOH , CH3CH OSi C CH3 31 CH3 2i , CH3 2COH , FCH2 ,F2CH , F3C , CH3CHF , CH3CF2 , CH3 2CF ,CH3CH2CHOH and FCH2CHOH . Preferred is where R is CH3CHOH . Y is a bridging protecting group derived from an aldehyde, ketone or organosilicon compound, or equivalent thereof, including acetals, ketals, and the like and includes CH3 2C EMI10.1 EMI10.2 and substituted derivatives thereof, wherein said substituents are inert during the subject process described herein and include, inter alia,C1 C4 lower alkyl and alkoxy. Representative examples of aldehydes, ketones and organosilicon compounds which are precursors for Y include those which are known in the antibiotic art, e.g., acetone, 2,2 dimethoxypropane, cyclohexanone, l,l dimethoxycyclohexane, methylethylketone, 2,2 diethoxy n butane, acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde dimethylacetal, acetophenone, p methoxyacetophenone, dichlorodimethylsilane, dichlorodiphenylsilane, dichloroethylphenylsilane, dichlorodi t butylsilane and the like.A preferred reagent for forming the Y moiety is 2,2 dimethoxypropane wherein the Y moiety is formed by reacting the deblocked amino alcohol of structure V for example with 2,2 dimethoxypropane in the presence of a catalyst such as boron trifluoride etherate, toluenesulfonic acid, or the like in a solvent such as methylene chloride, ether, chloroform, dioxane or the like at a temperature of from 100C to 350C for from a few minutes to 1 hour. The bridging protecting group Y, not readily removable by hydrogenation, is removable by acid or base hydrolysis as described in the reference U.S.P.4,234,596, hereby incorporated by reference for that purpose. Structure I is derived as described above from the reaction of ketone, aldehyde or organosilicon compound with the deblocked amino alcohol V, where R3 and R6 are H EMI11.1 Representative examples of structure I include EMI11.2 EMI12.1 Further examples of Structure I for illustration purposes are given below in the Table indicating specific values chosen for R2 and bridging protecting group Y.

A preferred compound of structure I for use in the process is EMI17.1 A synthesis of a species of general structure I is given below in the Flow Sheet for converting the monocyclic B lactam ring system into the bicyclic system, 8 oxo 3 oxa 1 azabicyclo 4.2.0 octane with the exocyclic methylene group alpha to the beta lactam ring and a l hydroxyethyl radical adjacent to the beta lactam carbonyl. By the same general procedure, the compounds encompassed by Structure I, where R2 and Y have other values disclosed herein, within the claimed definition, are also obtained. FLOW SHEETEMI18.1 beta epimer alpha epimer EMI19.1 beta epimerEMI19.2 In words relative to the above Flow Sheet, starting compound A with the indicated stereochemistry where R4 is H or t butyldimethylsilyl, is known and can be synthesized by the method described in the above cited Heterocycles reference, hereby incorporated by reference for this particular purpose. The selenation or sulfenylation of A to B is conducted under dry and O2 free conditions, preferably under nitrogen, by treating A with a proton abstracting agent such as LDA lithium diisopropylamide in an anhydrous solvent such as THF tetrahydrofuran , and in the presence of HMPA hexamethylphosphoramide to increase rate of reaction, followed by treating with a selenation or sulfenylation agent. Other proton abstracting agents which can be used are lithium hexamethyldisilazide,NaH, lithium cyclohexylisopropylamide, and the like.Preferred is LDA. Other solvents which can be used in this particular step are glyme, diethylether, dimethylformamide, and the like. The solvent should be dry and inert under the reaction conditions and preferred is tetrahydrofuran. The selenating agent used is a diselenide or a disulfide if sulfenylating such as diphenyldisulfide , preferably diphenyldiselenide, and the reaction is carried out at 780C to OOC under nitrogen atmosphere for a period of time of about 1 to 8 hours to achieve a desired yield of the selenated compound B. The same procedure for sulfenylating can be generally used with the corresponding disulfide. A mixture of alpha and beta selenides is produced, but it is not absolutely necessary to perform a separation step since either diastereomer or a mixture can be used in the later oxidation step to produce the methylene compound. The resulting selenated ester B is hydrolyzed to the acid C by conventional alkaline hydrolysis in e.g., aqueous methanol at a temperature of about 250 to 600C, for about 2 to 24 hours, under a nitrogen atmosphere, to obtain desirable yields of compound C. Other solvent combinations can also be used, e.g. aqueous ethanol. The resulting acid C is reduced to the primary alcohol D by a suitable reducing agent, including BH3.Me2S in solvent THF, at a temperature of 0 to 650C, for about 2 to 24 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere to achieve the alcohol.Other reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride and borane can also be used which are not detrimental to the beta lactam ring. The alcohol selenide D is then treated with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid THF solvent to form E having the exocyclic double bond at the a position to theB lactam ring. Generally this step is conducted at about 0 to 1000C, for a period of time of about 1 to 24 hours. Other oxidizing agents which can be used include m chloroperbenzoic acid, ozone, and NalO4 in solvents including methylene chloride, toluene, and EtOH. Preferred oxidizing system is hydrogen perioxide in acetic acid THF solvent. Following the above oxidation elimination procedure, the ring nitrogen is deblocked, if a conventional blocking group is present, by the procedure of acid or base catalyzed hydrolysis, but not hydrogenation, and the amino alcohol is joined together by reaction with a divalent bridgingprotecting group as described herein such as 2,2 dimethoxypropane, or the like, in a suitable solvent and presence of a Lewis acid such asBF3.Et2O, p toluenesulfonic acid, chlorosulfonic acid to form F. Other bridging protecting agents which can also be used are cyclohexanone, p methoxyacetophenone or its dimethylketal, or a diorganodichlorosilane such as di t butyldichlorosilane.Preferred is 2,2 dimethoxypropane, reacted in methylene chloride solvent. Following cyclization the l hydroxy group is deblocked by treating with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in DMF to form G. The deblocking of the l hydroxy group has been found to be highly favorable in obtaining a high ratio of B a epimers in the subsequent reduction step. Following the deblocking step to yield G, the reduction is carried out as described hereinabove with Raney Nickel, to yield a mixture of the methyl and a methyl epimers H, being H ss and H a, respectively, with the methyl epimer predominating. The resulting ss and a isomers can be separated by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC , as for example, on a Pre PAK 500 silica column as in conventional practice or by fractional crystallization or the like to obtain the fi epimer in high purity. The fi epimer once obtained in high purity, can be converted to I and then J by using the methods described in U.S.P. 4,234,596 hereby incorporated by reference for that purpose. The reaction H ss EMI23.1 I establishes the blocking group R4 and is typically accomplished by treating H fl with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, lithium diisopropyl amide, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, or n butyllithium in a solvent such as methylene chloride, ether, THF, dioxane, DMF, DMSO or the like, followed by treatment with an acyl halide of choice such as an alkanoyl, aralkanoyl or nuclear substituted aralkanoyl, or alkyl, aryl or aralkyl, substituted aralkyl or substituted aryl haloformate such as allylchloroformate or p nitrobenzylchloro formate or the like at a temperature of from 78 C to 250C for from 1 24 hours. Alternatively, the protecting group R 4 may be a triorganosilyl group, such as t butyldimethylsilyl, t butyldiphenylsilyl, triphenylsilyl, isopropyldimethylsilyl, for example, or may be 3,4 dimethoxybenzyl, for example. Typically R 4 is established by treating H ss in a solvent such asCH2C12, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, hexamethylphosphoramide, tetrahydrofuran and the like with a silylating agent such as t butyldimethylchlorosilane, t butyldiphenylchlorosilane, triphenylchlorosilane, and the like at a temperature of from 200 to 250C for from 0.5 to 24 hours in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, or imidazole or 4 dimethylaminopyridine.The de blocking reaction IEMI23.2 J is typically conducted by acid hydrolysis such as aqueous acetic acid at a temperature of from 250C to 750C for from 5 minutes to 3 hours. The oxidation of J to K is accomplished by treating J in a solvent such as acetone or the like with Jones reagent at from 78 to 250C for from one minute to 2 hours. Alternatively, the conversions I to J to K may be done in one step by treatment of I as above with Jones reagent to give K directly. The carboxylic acid K can then be be treated for example, by the method described in the above cited Heterocycles reference and U.S.P.4,383,946 and 4,309,346, all hereby incorporated by reference for this purpose, to arrive at subsequent active l ss methylcarbapenem antibiotics, including lR,5S,6S 2 2 N,N dimethylamino 2 iminoethyl thio 6 lR 1 hydroxyethyl l methylcarbapen 2 em 3 carboxylic acid, useful as described hereinabove. Preferred process for selectively reducing an exocyclic a methylene ring double bond of the invention comprises the step of contacting the compound EMI24.1 in an organic solvent therefor as described hereinabove, with a hydrogen atmosphere at about 40 psig reaction pressure with Raney nickel catalyst for a time sufficient to obtain a mixture of a methyl and methyl epimers in a ss to a epimeric molar ratio of greater than 1. Methods of synthesis are given below in theDiagram, Schemes, and discussion, for other starting compounds A, where radical R2 on the beta lactam ring is chosen from other groups within the claimed definition therefor. The methods are taken fromU.S.P. 4,309,346 and U.S.P. 4,383,946, which are incorporated by reference specifically for this purpose.

Typically, the carbanion reagent is prepared prior to addition of substrate 6 on treatment of the triorganothiomethane with a strong base such as n butyllithium, t butyllithium, phenyllithium, lithium diisopropylamide LDA or the like. Resulting intermediate 7 can be mono , or dialkylated at ring position 3. Alkylation of 7 provides 8.

The eventual 6 substituents nomenclature relative to final, bicyclic structure can also be established by direct acylation using an acylating agent such as N acyl imidazole or the like. SuchN acyl imidazole acylating reagents are listed below. Also given below is a detailed description of this second approach for establishing R2.
