# 2 Cyclopentyl cyclopentanone, fragrance or flavouring compositions containing it and their use.

## Abstract
2 Cyclopentyl cyclopentanone is a novel compound which has been found to be suitable for use as a perfuming or odor modifying ingredient of fragrance or flavoring compositions, the compositions themselves being useful in the perfuming or flavoring of, for example, dentifrices etc. 2 Cyclopentyl cyclopentanone has a fresh, cool perfume or flavor and can enhance the perfume or flavor of other perfuming or odor modifying ingredients. It can readily be produced from cyclopentanone.

## Description
DESCRIPTION 2 CYCLOPENTYL CYCLOPENTANONE, FRAGRANCE OR FLAVORING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING IT, AND USE OF SAID COMPOSITIONS IN THE PERFUMING OR FLAVORING OF, FOR EXAMPLE, DENTIFRICES This invention relates to 2 cyclopentyl cyclopentanone, fragrance or flavoring compositions containing 2 cyclopentyl cyclopentanone as perfuming or odormodifying ingredients, and the use of such compositions. In recent years, ingredients that give various perfuming or flavoring notes1 particularly fresh, clean, cool and green notes, have been incorporated in fragrance or flavoring compositions for use in dentifrices, mouth fresheners, chewing gums, foodstuffs, beverages, shampoos, toilet soaps, cosmetics, household materials, detergents, etc. It is common practice to prepare such fragrance or flavoring compositions by suitably combining various known perfuming or odor modifying ingredients or incorporating them in varying proportions. However, combinations of known perfuming or odor modifying ingredients are not entirely satisfactory, and the development of novel perfuming or odor modifying ingredients affording fresh, clean and cool notes has been highly desired. The invention provides fragrance or flavoring compositions having enhanced and or different odors or flavors than the conventional ones, by using a novel perfuming or odor modifying ingredient that can impart fresh and clean and or cool notes to fragrance or flavoring compositions The present invention is based upon the finding that a novel substance, 2 cyclopentyl cyclopentanone, exhibits an excellent perfuming or odor modifying effect. Thus, the present invention provides a fragrance or flavoring composition containing as one of its active ingredients a novel substance, 2 cyclopentyl cyclopentanone, expressed by the following formula EMI2.1 2 Cyclopentyl cyclopentanone call readily be synthesized by known.synthesizing methods, for example, the methods described in Roland Mayer, Chem. Ber. 89, 1443 1956 . Martin Cordon, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 76, 1643 1954 and Georges Le Guillanton, Bull. Soc. Chim. France, 1963 3 , 611.A preferred method in terms of yield, operabilityg and availability of starting material involves condensing cyclopentanone in the presence of a basic condensation agent and hydrogenating the resulting 2 cyclopentylidene cyclopentanone 2 Cyclopentyl cyclopentanone possesses light green notes svhich are fresh and cool and minty notes which are strong, sharp and cool. Therefore, 2 cyclopentylcyclopentanone imparts fresh, clean and or cool notes to various fragrance or flavoring compositins when incorporated in them.The fragrance or flavoring compositions can be used in order to modify or improve the olfactory properties of materials such as dentifrices, mouth fresheners, chewing gums, foodstuffs, beverages, shampoos, soaps, cosmetics, household materials, detergents, cleaning products, paints, papers, etc. The amount of 2cyclopentyl cyclopentanone added to a fragrance or flavoring composition can vary according to the type of the the fragrance or flavoring composition, the specific organoleptic effects required, and so forth. Usually, that amount is 0.001 to 40 by weight, preferably 0.01 to 15 by weight, based on the fragrance or flavoring composition. 2 Cyclopentyl cyclopentanone is stable and can be easily mixed with other perfuming or odor modifying ingredients. It is also economical because it is produced from an ordinary starting material with ease and at low cost. The present invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the following examples.Referential Example k 5 liter three necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a reflux condenser was charged with 840 g of cyclopentanone and 840 g of a 10 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and they were reacted at 900C. for 3 hours.Then, the mixed solution was cooled to room temperature, and the aqueous phase was removed by a separating funnel. The organic phase was washed with 840 g of water, 840 g of a 5 aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride, 840 g of a 5 aqueous solution of NaHCO3, and 840 g of water in this order, then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled at a reduced pres sure of 1.5 mmHg, to to obtain 405 g of 2 fraction distilling off at 71.5 C. its infrared spectrum , NMR and mass spectrum confirmed thnt the friction was 2 cyclopentylidene cyclopentanone. To 380 g of the 2 cyclopentylidene cyclopentanone was added 17.0 g of 5 palladium carried on activated carbon as catalyst, and the 2 cyclopentylidene cyclopentanone was hydrogenated at ordinary temperature and ordinary pressure.After completion of the hydrogenation, the catalyst was removed by filtration, and the residue was subjected to precision distillation at a reduced pressure of 3.5 mmHg, thereby to afford 342 g of a fraction distilling out at 79.5 C. Its infrared spectrum, NMR and mass spectrum confirmed that the fraction was 2 cyclopentyl cyclopentanone. Gas chromatography also confirmed that its purity was 99.8 .The identifying data of this compound were as follows IR 1730 cm 1 c 0 13C NMR 219.72 C 0, S 52.73 CH, d 40.02 CE, d 38.50 CH2, t 30.76 C 2, t 29.65 CH2, t 27.48 CH2, t 25.14 CH2, t 24.83 CH2, t 20.62 CH2,t ppm from TMS MS m e 152 15 123 10 109 10 85 30 84 100 83 30 67 50 55 25 54 23 53 20 41 27 39 23 Example 1 The following materials were mixed to prepare a fragrance composition for use in a dentifrice.
