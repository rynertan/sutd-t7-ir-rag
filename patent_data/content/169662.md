# BASE COMPONENT FOR A FLUID TRANSFER DEVICE

## Abstract
The device is a hand pump which has a hand lever pivoted at 61 to lugs 60 and actuating pumping pistons 22 and 23 to draw fluid from a reservoir cylinder mounted in recess 58 in the base component of the pump. The body 19 of the base component is extruded from aluminium which is easily machined to provide the piston and valve passages. A sleeve 27 is mounted in the body 19 to receive the piston 22 and is secured to the body by an encapsulating housing 20 moulded from fibre reinforced synthetic resin. The housing 20 includes the lugs 60 and is designed to withstand the stresses imposed during operation of the pump. Also described are an alternative design of hand pump, a hydraulic cylinder and a hydraulic valve all having two components joined together by encapsulation.
