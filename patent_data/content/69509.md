# A circuit for reading out address data applied to a memory in a one chip microcomputer.

## Abstract
A circuit for reading out addresses applied to a memory in a one chip microcomputer which does not have any address terminals but has input output terminals 5, 6 . The circuit comprises a program counter 1 for specifying reading out addresses of the memory. Transfer gates T and a shift register 4 are provided. The transfer gates transfer the contents of the program counter to the shift register when an address output enable signal at input terminal 5 is applied to the transfer gates. The contents stored in the shift register 4 are read out, generally in series by clock pulses, to an address output terminal 6 connected to the shift register, preferably at the most or least significant bit stage.
