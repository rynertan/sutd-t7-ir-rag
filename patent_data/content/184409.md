# IMPROVED METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF ZEOLITES

## Abstract
An improved method is provided for the preparation of organic cation containing zeolites and their thermal decom position products, by adding an organic templating agent to a preformed aluminosilicate gel containing less than a specified amount of water and a low alkali metal content, and maintaining the mixture at crystallization conditions until the crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite is formed.
