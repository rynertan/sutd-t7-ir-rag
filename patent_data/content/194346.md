# Recovery of tungsten from ammoniacal solutions.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for recovering tungsten from a relatively dilute ammoniacal tungsten solution. The method involves adding hexamethylenetetramine to the tungsten solution in an amount sufficient to form a hexamethylenetet ramine complex then adjusting the pH to from about 1.0 to about 2.0 with a mineral acid to form a precipitate of the complex containing at least about 99 of the tungsten, and separating the precipitate from the resulting mother liquor.
