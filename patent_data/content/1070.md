# Process for producing pyruvic acid.

## Abstract
A novel process for producing pyruvic acid is provided in which process hydroxyacetone is oxidized with a molecular oxygen containing gas in a water containing or aqueous solvent in the presence of a catalyst. The catalysts useful for the above oxidation reaction are those which composed of either at least one platinum group metal selected from the group consisting of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and rhenium, or the at least one platinum group metals admixed with at least one elements selected from the group consisting of silver, tellurium, tin, bismuth, lead and indium or with the compound of the at least one element. The resulting pyruvate can be effectively isolated in the form of a solid by concentrating the reaction solution and adding the concentrate to isopropyl alcohol.
