# Image enhancement.

## Abstract
Apparatus is described for enhancing an image repre sented by picture signals corresponding to respective colour components of successive elements of the image, the apparatus comprising signal generating means 27Y, 27M, 27C for generating sharp and unsharp signals from the picture signals. Fringe signal generating means 28Y, 28M, 28C derives a plurality of fringe signals by combining the sharp and unsharp signals in a predetermined manner correction means 29 applies modifying functions to the sharp or unsharp signals or other premodified picture signals to derive modified picture signals and adding means 30 sums the fringe signals with the modified picture signals to derive a plurality of output signals.
