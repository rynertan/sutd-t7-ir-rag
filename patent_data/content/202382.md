# PROCESS FOR THE DECOLOURIZATION OF PULP MILL PROCESS STREAMS

## Abstract
Pulp mill effluent streams having a pH greater than 7.0 are decolourized by reducing the acidity of the effluent to below pH 4.0 so that colour bodies are precipitated from the effluent. The effluent is filtered and organic compounds are absorbed from the filtrate on carbon particles which are regenerated by a caustic solution.
