# Magnetic head having a thin strip of magnetoresistive material as a reading element.

## Abstract
A magnetic head for reading analogue information on a track of a recording medium 10 associated with the magnetic head, having a strip of magnetoresistive material 9 which serves as a reading element, is arranged in a magnetic yoke at a given distance from the pole faces 12, 13 formed by the ends of the limbs 1, 2 of the magnetic yoke, and is connected in the magnetic circuit formed by the magnetic yoke, wherein the magnetic yoke comprises three limbs 1, 2, 3 separated by non magnetic layers 4, 5 and wherein the pole face 11 of one of the outer limbs 3 is located at a greater distance from the recording medium 10 than the pole faces 12, 13 of the central limb 2 and the other outer 1 limb.
