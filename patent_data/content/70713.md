# A semiconductor device comprising a bulk defect region and a process for producing such a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device, for example a CMOS, includes a semiconductor substrate 1 having a denuded region 2 and a bulk defect region 3 and semiconductor elements 4 and 5. Ele ment 4 may include a P well 15 while element 5 may include P type source or drain region 9, 10 . To minimise or eliminate leak current at the PN junction 12 the distance from the sur face of the substrate 1 to the surface of the bulk defect region 3 varies in response to the nonuniform depth of the semicon ductor elements 4 and 5. The device may be made by selectiv ly forming forming the bulk defect region 3 with a high oxygen concen tration and a nonuniform depth that varies in response to the nonuniform depth of the elements and forming the elements above the bulk defect region.
