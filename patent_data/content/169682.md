# Fluid machine.

## Abstract
There is described a fluid machine which comprises an outer casing and a rotor assembly mounted within the casing. The rotor assembly includes a hollow shaft having a fluid reaction member mounted therein. The machine may be used as a pump wherein drive means such as an electric motor may be provided on the rotor assembly to rotate the rotor and pump fluid through the hollow shaft. Alternatively, the fluid machine may be used as a generator, wherein fluid is passed through the hollow shaft causing the rotor assembly to rotate. Also, the machine may be used as a drive means for an air or water borne craft.
