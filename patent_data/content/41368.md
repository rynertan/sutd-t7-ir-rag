## Abstract
The apparatus includes an inflatable cushion 42 that is longitudinally folded to a compact, strap like configuration conforming to the shape of the belt restraint 14 , a flat, slim inflator 48 being enclosed within and surrounded by the folded cushion 42 . The folded cushion 42 is releasably enclosed within an outer cover 36 to which it is attached, the outer cover 36 being attached to the underside of the belt restraint 14 and fastened over the folded cushion by a long zipper 45, 46 . The means 38 for attaching the cover 36 to the belt restraint 14 , and the zipper 45, 46 comprise hook and loop fastening material. The inflator 48 is actuatable by a crash impact sensor mounted on the vehicle, and is operable to generate an innocuous gas for inflating the cushion, the covering being automatically opened upon such inflation of the cushion.
