# Hood for coating glass containers and coating method.

## Abstract
A coating hood 310 for applying protective coatings to glass containers 316 conveyed therethrough has side walls 318,320 , each provided with a number of slots 364 for supplying coating compound to the main body of the containers 316 and a number of receivers 369 in substan tial alignment with respective slots 364 in the opposite side wall 320,318 , to receive an output therefrom. Blowers 358,360 deliver air laden with coating compound to the slots 364 . An air flow guide 312 enables coating free air supplied through a blower 394 to pass through openings 404 situated in risers 382,392 forming part of the under side of the air flow guide 312 , these openings 404 being sepa rated from the slots 365 by a vertical distance of 2 8 cm. The openings 404 on one side are offset in the longitudinal direction of the hood 310 from the openings 404 on the other side, each opening 404 supplying an envelope of coating free air across the finish of the containers 316 such that lateral boundaries of each opening 404 on one side of the hood 310 are substantially coincident with lateral boundaries of the offset and laterally adjacent openings 404 on the other side.
