# A TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING RADIO SYSTEM PERFORMANCE DURING FADING

## Abstract
A technique for reducing the average fade duration of signals in a radio system by simulating motion of a plurality of transmitting antennas is disclosed. This simulation is accomplished by slowly and continuously varying a charac teristic of the modulated carrier signal supplied to the antennas. The altered characteristic can either be the power of the modulated carrier signal supplied to each of the antennas or the phase between modulated carrier signals coupled to the antennas. This technique can also be applied at a receiver to reduce the average fade duration of signals arriving thereat by simulating motion of a plurality of receiving antennas.
