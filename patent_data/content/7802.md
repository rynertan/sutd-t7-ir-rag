# Fibrous composite comprising assembly of mesh structure of high recovery ratio and fibrous structure of low recovery ratio, and use of such fibrous composite as heat insulation for buildings.

## Abstract
A fibrous composite comprising a coalesced assembly of A a sheet like mesh structure composed of fibers of a synthe tic elastomeric polymer, the individual fibers being intercon nected at random in irregular spaced apart relationship thereby forming a number of meshes of different shapes and sizes, said mesh structure having a recovery ratio after 10 stretch of at least 70 in two arbitrarily selected, mutually perpendicular directions on the plane of said mesh structure, and B a mat , web or sheet like fibrous structure having a recovery ratio after 10 stretch of less than 50 in at least one arbitrarily selected direction. An elastic fibrous composite of this invention is suitable as various apparel base materials and industrial materials such as filter cloths, adsorbents, and heat insulating materials.
