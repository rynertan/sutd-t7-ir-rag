## Description
WATER DISPERSIONS DESCRIPTION Heretofore water has not been used successfully as the carrier for numerous preparations designed to provide a continuous unbroken smooth film when applied upon a work surface.Exemplary of such preparations are rust proofing compounds of wax, oil, or silicone bases which are currently applied in various forms utilizing non aqueous solvents. Petrochemicals serve as the primary solvents for such compounds. Mold releases comprised of oils, animal or vegetable fats, such as lecithin or polydimethylsiloxanes constitute another example of preparations which to the present time have been applied by means of similar non aqueous solvents. Various adhesives form a further class of compositions which have been consistently carried in other than water solvents particularly those requiring quick tackification. A still further category is constituted of the stain proofing compounds, especially those formed of telefluoromer resins, wherein expensive and toxic chemicals have been the solvents of choice.The foregoing merely illustrate the exceedingly wide range of preparations which have been to the present time reduced to solutions for coating application and all of which have eschewed the use of water as the carrier. It is recognized that many active ingredients for film formation may be emulsified, but to date emulsion technology has not been satisfactory for providing a continuous film in an efficacious manner. Shortcomings of existing emulsion technology are two fold a Those relating to oil in water have failed because the hydrophobic active ingredients must of necessity be in the oil phase and in this type of emulsion water is the continuous phase. Consequently, there is no molecular continuity of the active ingredient so that the resultant film would be discontinuous with uneven distribution of the active ingredient, An example would be the commercial silicone emulsions which are basically low viscosity polydimethylsiloxanes emulsified in water and in these emulsions the water is on the outside or in the continuous phase. Attempting to use such an emulsion as a mold release, for example1 would have disappointing results because the silicone would be distributed unevenly upon the applied surface and the compound would not serve to bring about reliable mold release. b Those resultant from water in oil are due to the altered nature of the active ingredient, Though the active ingredients are in the continuous phase by the nature of the present emulsion technology, these active ingredients are altered by the presence of water and or emulsifiers and their performance is not what would be expected should such have been applied in pure form or in solvent reduction, The active ingredients as applied are altered in appearance from the pre emulsion state. For instance, active ingredients which have been transparent become pasty or creamy resultant applications have been disappointing.Exemplary of this would be to prepare a silicone emulsion wherein the silicone would be in the oil or continuous phase and attempt to use this as a mold release,Experience has shown that although the distribution of the silicone may be even and continuous in this type of emulsion, the presence of the water and or emulsifiers severely limits the release effect of the silicone, These compounds simply have not worked. When applied the silicone emulsion is paste like or creamy in appearance and not characteristic of the trans parent quality of polydimethylsiloxane which would be the preferred appearance. It is indeed apparent that the failure heretofore to utilize water as a carrier for film or coating forming agents has necessarily brought about costly development of commercial solvents with the attendant drain of fossil fuel reserves.Very few of the solvents used currently are without real or potential hazard as the same involve inherent peril factors such as caused by toxicity levels and flammability. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a preparation which is water base and which in apply cation is productive of a noninterrupted, continuous film with even distribution of the active ingredient7 and the use of which preparation eliminates the various hazards associated with organic solvents or vehicles, It is another object of the present invention to provide a preparation which effects the use of water as a carrier for hydrophobic chemicals, for chemicals that have previously been delivered by means of petrochemical or other non aqueous solvents, and for improving the effectiveness of systems which presently incorporate water as a carrier. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a preparation of the character stated which is capable of the equally efficacious application of both water soluble and water insoluble active ingredients for providing a continuous film and wherein the physical and chemical characteristics of such ingredients are unaltered from the prediluted state thereof. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a preparation in the nature of a dispersion which may be applied in any convenient manner to the selected work surface, such as by spraying, painting, coating, dipping, etc. It is another object of the present invention to provide a preparation of the character stated which is of wide versatility, being capable of producing a continuous unbroken even film from a broad spectrum of film and coating agents, such as water base paints, lubricants, sealants, mold releases, protective coatings, waxes, and the like. It is another object of the present invention to provide a preparation of the character stated which has a substantially indefinite shelf life which may be most economically produced, there being no necessity for complex instrumentation and equipment for formulation which is extremely effective in use and with the films developed thereby being tenacious, durable and resistant to rupture, scuffing or the like through normal intended usage peculiar to the particular film. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention contemplates the development of a water base preparation in the nature of a dispersion which is physically and chemically distinct from traditional emulsions and single phase solutions heretofore used for film or coating formation. The system of the present invention embodies immiscible phases, one of which may be considered a continuous or oil phase, and the other a water phase, with there being a novel dispersal agent for effecting the dispersion of these two phases. By reason of the inclusion of this dispersal agent water is rendered effective as a carrier for hydrophobic active ingredients as well as for water soluble chemicals the latter necessarily being also soluble in the continuous phase.The preparations of this invention are amenable to application in any conventional manner and thus may be applied upon the preselected surface as by spraying, painting, dipping and the like, but with the resultant film being uninterrupted by any lacunae, pores or geometric formations and with the active ingredient being evenly distributed. Although the constituents of the preparation will be discussed in greater detail below, attention is directed to the unique dispersal agent which is critical for the development of preparations of this invention. It has been found that a specific cocodiethanolamide from that class of chemicals, which has been heretofore recognized as emulsifiers, possesses certain unexpected and surprising properties when used in a predetermined proportionality in the two phase system of the present invention. This particular cocodiethanolamide is an amber liquid having a congealing point of approximately 60C. and with a specific gravity at 25 C. of .99. The free or unreacted fatty acid, as lauric, is 3 48 maximum and the pH of a 18 dispersion is between 8 and 9.This compound is soluble in alcohols, glycols, ketones, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated solvents, while also being dispersible in water at low concentrations of 1 to 28. It is also soluble at higher concentrations and with a 10 solution being quite viscous approximating a gel. It is to be thus understood that the term cocodiethanolamide as referred to and described herein shall be that form of the compound possessing the abQve described physical and chemical characteristics. It has been discovered that providing cocodiethanolamide in an amount approximating 0.58 by weight of the system or preparation will react with the water phase and the active ingredient phase when it is not in an emulsion to bring about what is generally considered an unstable emulsion, that is, wherein the phases tend to separate, but are capable of being brought into relative stability by agitation, and upon application the phases separate and revert to their constituent components whereby the active ingredient does not produce a continuous film but one which is highly irregular and interrupted, typical of the results obtained to the present time when water base solvents are utilized, If the proportionality of the cocodiethanolamide is increased as within the rangofitirnediatelyabove 0.58 to approximately 2.58 by weight, when the active ingredient is initially in an unemulsified condition, a resulting stable emulsion is developed and thus the cocodiethanolamide acts in the expected manner of an emulsifying agent, so that upon dispensing of such a preparation containing such proportionality, a discontinuous broken film may be presented despite the fact that the emulsion is stable.In its generally normal state the emulsion gives a visual appearance of a homogeneous, pasty character, consistent with its being considered stable. Thus, the foregoing merely underscores that cocodiethanolamide as used in the aforesaid proportion with the active ingredients of the preparations of this invention, when such active ingredients are initially in an unemulsified condition, serves in its characteristic function as an emulsifying agent. However, if the quantity of cocodiethanolamide is increased beyond 2.5 , as within the specific range of 2.5 to 10 by weight, the system loses its stability so that a separation immediately develops which1 at first glance, would bear a seeming resemblance to the unstable emulsion incorporating a 0.5 by weight of said agent as above described. Despite any visual similarity between the phase separations of the unstable emulsion and the preparation incorporating in excess of 2.5 by weight of cocodiethanolamide, such generally corresponding phases are quite different both chemically and physically.It is suggested that the preparation with the greater quantity of cocodiethanolamide has become a dispersion, that is atypical of traditional technology having, as stated, the immiscibility of the two phases being sharply defined. Without any intention of limitation, the preparation herein will be referred to as a dispersion to facilitate exposition. A continuous film is promoted by the dispersion as distinguished from the discontinuous character of the dispensing of an emulsion. As developed more fully hereinbelow, the preferred effective range of cocodiethanolamide for preparations of the present invention is 2.5 to 3.5 by weight when the active ingredients are initially in an unemulsified condition. However, research has demonstrated that additional amounts up to 10 by weight bring about no diminution in the character and quality of the developed film. Above 10 it has been discovered that the applied coating develops an undesirable thickness of a generally lumpy character so that beyond such limit a continuous, unbroken film is no longer achievable. This crucial, unexpected action caused by the cocodiethanolamide is all the more apparent when one recognizes that the use of emulsifying agents in emulsions cause a predictive response. It is recognized that there are numerous factors which contribute to the relative stability or instability of a particular emulsion but generally when the emulsifier is below a predetermined proportionality the associated emulsion will be in an unstable state with the phases separated.As the emulsifier is added, the emulsion becomes relatively stable, with the phases intermixing to present a homogeneous appearance and further addition of the emulsifier generally has no effect upon the stability of the emulsion. But with the present invention the further addition of cocodiethanolamide beyond substantially 2.5 by weight of the system brings about a destruction of the erstwhile stability so that if a stable emulsion did exist, one would necessarily expect that the further addition of the cocodiethanolamide would be without effect. As pointed out, this unusual and surprising action of this particular agent supports the view that the system is no longer an emulsion with all of the various accepted emulsion characteristics but becomes a dispersion, with the cocodiethanolamide manifestly ceasing to act as an emulsifying agent.Therefore, the crucialness of this agent to preparations formed in accordance with this disclosure is apparent. It will be fully understood that no other compound has been found to possess the requisite properties despite extensive investigatory efforts. As developed hereinabove the systems of the present invention are discussed as being in a non emulsified state, independent of the cocodiethanolamide. However, the foregoing clearly comprehends that through the addition of the cocodiethanolamide the various systems transitorily move into an unstable emulsion, then into a stable emulsion as further cocodiethanol am and thefi into a dispersion as the requisite energy level is achieved through the incorporation of a predetermined amount of cocodiethanolamide. Theoretically, a requisite amount of energy is manifestly required to achieve the dispersion state attained by the predetermined amount of cocodiethanolamide. Understandably, the intermediate or transitory unstable and stable states of emulsion also require respective critical energy levels. Accordingly, the present invention teaches that the specific cocodiethanolamide imparts certain characteristics to water and oil mixtures when used as described and in a quantity requisite to provide the necessary energy to exceed a stable emulsion state as such is determined in accordance with recognized technology. The extreme importance of this unique property is more fully understood when the cocodiethanolamide is added to existing stable or unstable emulsions. It has been found that adding 0.5 by weight of cocodiethanolamide to a preparation which contains a stable emulsion is adequate to provide the necessary energy to cause such preparation to take on the unique characteristics of the dispersion of the present invention. With preparations comprising unstable emulsions, the cocodiethanolamide must be added in a quantity sufficient to provide the necessary energy to render such emulsions stable and then to progress therebeyond to the unusual and unexpected dispersion state developed by the present invention. It is understood that the emulsified conditions of such active ingredients, that is whether the same are in stable or unstable state and to what degree, may be readily determined by well known, widely practiced technology so that as the cocodiethanolamide is added to unstable emulsions one may determine when the point of stability has been reached and then proceed with further incorporation of cocodiethanolamide to attain the dispersion with the resultant preparation having the predetermined characteristics. It should be, of course, understood that with unstable emulsions as herein discussed, generally accepted emulsifying agents may be used for rendering such systems stable and with the cocodiethanolamide being thus added thereafter. Consequently, nothing herein is to be interpreted as requiring the use of cocodiethanolamide for raising the energy level of unstable emulsions to that of stable emulsions. The primary point is that cocodiethanolamide provides its unique functions only after the particular emulsion has reached a state of stability. Illustrative of the foregoing is the utilization of cocodiethanolamide with latex paints which comprehend paints which are stable emulsions as well as those which have varying degrees of instability. The addition of cocodiethanolamide in an amount of no less than 0.5 to stable emulsions creates the necessary dispersion so that the particular paints are rendered amenable for preparations of this invention in conjunction with the other prerequisites of the invention.Similarly, with paints which are in unstable emulsions the addition of sufficient cocodiethanolamide to render same stable plus at least 0.58 by weight thereabove adapt same to constitute a preparation of this invention which thus may be sprayed or applied in any other convenient manner without foams, film rupture and the like and create a continuous unbroken coating or film upon the applied surface. The foregoing clearly demonstrates that the specific emulsifiers in latex paint have provided energy that cocodiethanolamide would have had to supply to achieve a stable emulsion had such not been present. This energy is added to that of the cocodiethanolamide and with the prescribed addition thereof, as in the order of 0.58 to stable emulsions, incorporating sufficient energy to change the stable emulsions into the dispersions of the present invention. Another example is provided by silicone emulsions which are useful in developing a hard surface polish. Such silicone emulsions are generally stable so that the mere addition of 0.5 by weight of cocodiethanolamide will alter the character of the stable emulsion from oil in water so that the oil is now in the continuous phase. Such addition will also change the emulsion to the dispersion of the present invention so that the resultant film presented upon application of the particular preparation Emulsions offered by General Electric Co. of Waterford,New York as SM2033, SM2035, etc. will be transparent and not creamy like an emulsion vindicating that physical and chemical changes have occurred. However, even though the foregoing has disclosed that 0.5 of the cocodiethanolamide added to a stable emulsion will endow the preparation with attributes hitherto unachieved in this manner, the cocodiethanolamide may be added in an amount up to but not to exceed 10 and the increased amount will provide desired characteristics, such as, for instance, the degree of cohesiveness, and the particular thickness of the resultant film as may be shown, such amounts within the range of 0.5 to 10 by weight of the preparation being easily experimentally determined. Active ingredients adapted for incorporation in preparations of the present invention may be water insoluble and comprehend the active phase of water base paints commonly referred to as latex paints, exemplary of which are acrylic emulsions, vinyl emulsions, vinyl copolymer acetate emulsions, alkyd emulsions and polyurethane emulsions mold release and lubricating agents, as for instance, silicones, namely the alkyl polysiloxanes and polyorganosiloxanes lecithin and other soya or animal fat derivatives stearates, telefluoromers, as Teflon also synthetic lubricants, such as butoxylated and ethoxylated glycols as well as polybutene used for transmission belt dressing, etc. and various common greases, such as lithium stearate, calcium stearate, petrolatum,aluminum naphthenate, and the like for utilization as lubricant coatings moreover, mineral seal oil, as both a penetrant and a lubricant, as well as petroleum based hydrocarbon oils and synthetic oils are amenable to incorporation in preparations of the present invention, A further category of active ingredients would be constituted of the waxes, including animal waxes, such as beeswax and stearic acid vegetable waxes, such as carnauba, bayberry and candelilia, as well as the various artificial or synthetic waxes as obtained from distillation of paraffin base petroleum, The foregoing enumerated types and examples of active ingredients for forming constituents of preparations of this invention are not meant to be ex haustive but merely indicative of the comprehensive range E compounds which by virtue of the uniqueness of this invention may now be prepared in water borne systems to provide a continuous film which was heretofore deemed impossible. All these copoassitiona are of TEFLON is a trademark of E. I. DuPontDe Nemours Co, f Inc. for tetrafluoroethylene resins. the type wherein the intended usage or purpose requires an unbroken coating. Other active ingredients suitable for preparatipns of the present invention are water soluble compounds which, for purposes of illustration only, comprehend methoxy polyethylene glycols useful for lubricants and ointment bases for cosmetics and pharmaceutical water soluble resins such as hydroxyethyl celluloses and ethylene copolymers useful for coatings, paints, adhesives, caulking compounds and for textile operations water soluble herbicides such as paraquat, diethanol gamine salt of 2,4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid, diethanolamine salt of 2 2 methyl 4 chlorophenyoxy propionic acid and water soluble alkyl glycols and alkyl esters encom passing butoxylated and ethoxylated groups used for lubri cation, hydraulic fluids, and for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.Since the preparation of this invention is in the nature of a dispersion, water soluble active ingredients may be incorporated into preparations of this invention by solubilizing them in non aqueous solvents prior to dispersal. Consequently, these active ingredients will be in the continuous or oil phase upon application. This shows the advantages of this invention for the application of water soluble active ingredients when those active ingredients, as applied in a water solution would bead up on the surface because of the surface tension of the water and consequently cause uneven distribution. Accordingly, the range of treatments is infinite when it is recognized that such preparations can provide lubrication, mold release, adhesives, sealants, water displacement sprays, wax coatings, polymeric finishes, such as for floors and like surfaces inks and dyes asphaltic undercoatings, polyurethane coatings, and paints. Additionally, the water dispersions of this invention are also readily amenable to the inclusion in the continuous or oil phase of traditional non aqueous solvents for imparting to the resultant coating specific properties or characteristics, all in accordance with well recognized practice. Thus such solvents, in relatively small quantities as compared to the water, may be added for such purposes as film leveling, etching of the substrate, providing fragrance, and the like. Most importantly, however, traditional non aqueous solvents can be utilized in preparations of this invention for prediluting certain active ingredients so as to make them adaptable to the system. An example of such predilution would be certain insecticides which are solids in their pure chemical form high viscosity oils or greases that could not be handled in a conventional manner without some dilution. Also solvents may be utilized in certain instances to protect active ingredients which are prone to hydrolysis from interfacing with the water phase and thus deteriorating.Included among such solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, examples of which are benzene, toluene, xylene, commercial solvents which flash at 1000 and 1500 aliphatics, and aliphatic petroleum napthas, such as heptane, hexane, kerosene, lacquer diluent, napthol spirits, mineral seal oil, mineral spirits, odorless mineral spirits, deodorized kerosene, pentane, petroleum ether, Stoddard solvent, textile spirits, VM naptha, isoparaffinic hydrocarbons, as well as mixtures and blends thereof. Another general class of such traditional solvents are the chlorinated hydrocarbons among the more commonly used are carbon tetrachloride l,l,l trichlorethane, methylene chloride, and perchlorethylene. In addition to the foregoing, which is not meant to suggest an exhaustive compilation of suitable solvents, there may be included tetra hydrofuran and 2 nitropropane. As indicated above, and as is implicit in the involved chemistry, the choice of solvent is made in accordance with well known considerations, such as, compatibility with the particular active ingredient, etc. Further, it is understood that such solvents may be intermixed or blended to produce a desired resultant characteristic. The blending of heptane and hexane is but illustrative in that a blend of the same would dry somewhat slower than hexane alone but faster than heptane if used alone Preparations of water dispersions possessing the properties of the present invention have the following general formula PERCENT BY WEIGHTACTIVE INGREDIENT Approx..05 to 80 NON AQUEOUS SOLVENT 0 to Approx. 30 DISPERSAL AGENT Cocodiethanolamide 2.5 to 10 WATER Approx. 10 to 97.45 The foregoing formulation is applicable wherein the active ingredient has not been pre emulsified.

Furthermore, in this example1 the solvent is not a part, as it were, of the active ingredient as is shown in Examples III and VI above since it is more than likely incompatible with the latex paint which is fundamentally a closed system.Therefore, solvents utilized with such active ingredients are effectively brought into the preparation after the addition of the dispersal agent. The foregoing Example, X, embodies an active ingredient in an emulsion so that the amount of dispersal agent will be less than 2.5 and follow the second general formula set forth above. With this particular formula it was found that 1 by weight of the dispersal agent would in addition to assuring attainment of the requisite energy level for dispersion also provide for the especial features sought in a good paint.

The characteristics and procedures fr producing preo parations according to the present invention are vstraightv forward without requirement for complex instrumentat pn or equipment or concern for close control of enyixonmental factors as all such production may be effected under ambient conditions. The active ingredient, whether the same be in pre emulsified condition or otherwise, is intermixed with the indicated amount of cocodiethanolamide for thus forming the continuous phase and with the latter then having the water constituent blended therein, If a non aqueQus solvent is to be incorporated within the particular preparation as part of the active ingredient, the same is accordingly intermixed with the active ingredient and the cocodiethanolamide in the formation of the continuous phase. As pointed out hereinabove, if the particular solvent to be incorporated is incompatible with the active ingredient, then such solvent is added after the water or with or after the cocodiethanolamide if the active ingredient contains substantial water, as in fundamentally closed systems.
