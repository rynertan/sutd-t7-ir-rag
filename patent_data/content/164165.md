# Apparatus for imaging a mask pattern on a substrate.

## Abstract
A pre alignment system of an apparatus for imaging a mask pattern on a substrate is described. The pre alignment system comprises two optical imaging systems for imaging two alignment marks provided on the substrate for the purpose of fine alignment onto two radiation sensitive detectors, the combined output signals of the subdetectors of each detector being a measure of the alignment of the associated alignment mark relative to a detector. The alignment marks are preferably phase gratings and the imaging systems are preferably inter ference contrast microscopes.
