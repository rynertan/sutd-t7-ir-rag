## Claims
C L A I M S 1. A device for use within the household scope, suitable to create a certain vacuum degree, on containers destined to the food preservation, which operates by the effect of a depression created by a water flow coming from the water supply network, getting out of a nozzle placed in front of a drain pipe. 2. A device as per claim 1, including a chamber com municating with the space of the container wherein the vacuum has to be generated, in which chamber a nozzle of water protrudes which opens in front of the inlet of a defluxion duct. 3. A device as per the previous claims, wherein said chamber is formed by two coupled bodies, one of which forms also the nozzle and the other forms the defluxion duct. 4. A device as per the previous claims, wherein the chamber is connected, by a duct that is flexible but cannot be squashed to the cover equipped with a valve, which is engaged with the container in a sealed relation. 5. A device as per the previous claims, involving a connection suitable to be engaged with a tap.

## Description
Object of the invention is a device also for use within the household scope suitable to create a certain vacuum degree on containers destined to the food preservation, which operates by the effect of a depression created by a water flow coming from the water supply network, getting out of a nozzle placed in front of a drain pipe, in a chamber that is connected with the cavity wherein the vacuum has to be generated. In the chamber1 communicating with the space of the container wherein the vacuum has to be generated, a water nozzle protrudes, which opens in front of the inlet of a defluxion duct. Said chamber can be formed by two coupled bodies, one of which forms also the nozzle and the other forms the defluxion duct. The chamber is connected, by a duct that is flexible and cannot be squashed, to the cover of the container, which is equipped with a valve and is engaged with the container in a sealing way. A stiff or flexible connection to be engaged with a tap is combined with the body forming the nozzle. The enclosed drawing schematically shows an embodiment . bf a device according to the invention. In the drawing numeral 1 in a very summary way indicates a container to which a cover 3 can be applied with the interposition of a gasket 5, that assures the tight sealing even before the vacuum has been generated. In a schematic way numeral 7 indicates a valve, that permits the suction from the container inside and prevents the air penetration into the container inside. The real device, indicated by numeral 10, can be connected, by a duct that is flexible but cannot be squashed generically indicated by 12, to the valve 7 of cover 3 of the container. The duct 12 engages in a nipple or pipe fitting 14 formed on one of the two bodies 16, 18 forming the device, said two bodies being mutually coupled by sbrew type tension rods 20 or equivalent means and by a suitable annular gasket 22.The two bodies 16 and 18 form a chamber 24, wherein a nozzle 26, arising from a connection 28 for the feeding of water coming from the water supply network according to arrow f28, develops and protrudes the feeding can be carried out through a stiff or flexible connection and also through the interposition of a flexible duct, with an arrangement that is suitable to the connection with a tap of the water system within the household scope or other. The body 18 forms an outlet 30 for the defluxion of the water, which opens into the chamber 24 at a position perfectly coaxial with the nozzle 26. The passage 30 for the drain is developed with a profile with a section which increases from the initial orifice in the chamber 24 up to the drain section. The device operates according to the principle of the Pitot Tube and with a water feed with an even limited pressure it causes a depression in the chamber 24 and therefore a certain vacuum degree that can be also relatively very high in the container which is connected, as previously described, to the chamber 24, in such a way that a certain vacuum degree is generated in the container itself. The detachment of duct 12 from the connection on the valve 7 permits to maintain the container under vacuum, which container is closed by the action of valve 7, preventing the penetration of the air until the removal of cover 3. The device is very useful in practice since it can be used within the household scope without any auxiliary feeding system, but only through the very simple use of water at the same pressure as that of the water supply network.
