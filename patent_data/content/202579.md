# Power feed apparatus for load having reverse blocking characteristics.

## Abstract
A power feed apparatus in which a means for by passing the current reversely biasing the load is used for the normally used rectification means when the power converted by the transformer T is fed to the reversely blocking characteristics like magnetron M , whereby the price is lower and the shape is more compact without the use of the rectifier, because of the combination construction of the reverse bias current by pass means C
