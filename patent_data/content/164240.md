# DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR

## Abstract
A differential pressure sensor assembly 10 is disclosed, which includes a transducer 12 and a differential pressure sensor. The sensor responds to a fluid pressure change across an orifice 16 of a known size and transfers this sensed pres sure differential to the transducer. The electronic elements of the transducer are not exposed to the fluid which may be at an elevated temperature or have entrained particulates. The fluid flow can be determined by noting the fluid pressure change across the orifice of known size.
