# Display apparatus with mixed alphanumeric and graphic image.

A graphics display apparatus employing a raster scan ned cathode ray tube uses a refresh buffer constituted by a coded alphanumeric buffer 25 and associated character generator 49 for displaying alphanumeric characters and other symbols and an all points addressable buffer 27 for displaying graphics. Serialized data from the two buffers are mixed in a mixer 37 under control of at least one control bit attribute stored in the coded buffer 25 to provide a composite pel representing bit stream supplied to the cathode ray tube.
