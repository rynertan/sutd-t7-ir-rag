## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO POLYMERS HAVING BIOCIDAL PROPERTIES. The present invention relates to improved polymers having biocidal properties. In Journal Coating Technology 51, 88 91 1979 Co polymers from maleic anhydride and methylvinylether are disclosed wherein the anhydride group may be cleaved by subjecting it to a reaction with an alcohol or an amine and subsequently the carboxyl group formed may be reacted with tributyltinoxide. Consequently a number of copolymers has been prepared, wherein benzylamine or aniline is used as an amine, and methanol, ethanol, n propanol, butanol, cyclohexanol or benzylalcohol is used as an alcohol. In said publication particular attention is paid to the hardness of the coating films and the rate of hydrolysis of the polymers.Nothing is disclosed about any biocidal properties. Further, from Dutch patent specification 158,531 it is known, that in copolymers having a backbone of polystyrene maleic acid an organotin radical may be introduced by preparing first certain organotin vinyl monomers and subsequently either polymerizing said monomers or copolymerizing said monomers with vinylmonomers, e.g. acrylacrylates or maleic anhydride. It is also possible to start from a co polymer having the structure that is desired as backbone and reacting said co polymer with organotin compounds. High molecular weight styrene maleic anhydride copolymers may be prepared, e.g. by reacting equimolar proportions of styrene and maleic anhydride in butanone 2 at 80 C, in the presence of azoisobutyronitrile as a catalyst. The molecular weight of such a copolymer is about 105. By reacting such a polymer wherein the recurring units have the following structureEMI2.1 with R4 3 Sn O Sn R4 3 or HOSn R4 3, wherein R4is as hereinafter defined, the biocidal group Sn R4 3 may be introduced in accordance with either one of the following reaction schemesEMI2.2 EMI3.1 With said reaction eolar proportions of the reaction components, calculated from the acid number of the polymer, are dissolved or suspended in an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g.xylene, and said mixture is heated for several hours under reflux. If R4 3SnOH is used as one of the reaction components, the reaction water should be removed by means of an azeotropic distillation. It has appeared that organotin carboxylates that are in contactwith seawater will hydrolyse. Said reaction proceeds at a high rate. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a polymer having biocidal properties and characterised by containing the following recurrent unit I in its formula EMI3.2 wherein x 1 to 4 y y Z 2, y not being O, X1 OH or o Sn R 3, X2 EMI3.3 in which R1 is a substituted or non substituted alkyl radical having 5 18 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 which may be the same or different are chosen from substituted or non substituted alkyl radicals of 2 18 carbon atoms, and R4 is an alkyl radical having 1 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or non substituted aryl radical or a cycloalkyl radical.With the polymers of this invention upon exposure to an aqueous environment such as seawater the biocides that inhibit growth are released slowly, upon hydrolysis of the polymer, due to which a long lasting action is achieved. It has appeared that for a surface coated with such a polymer when organic biocides are bound covalently by means of an amide link, they will hydrolyse so slowly that at the coating surface a concentration is generated, that provides a sufficiently long lasting biocidal action. With the present polymers having polystyrene maleic anhydride as the backbone the anhydride group is very reactive with respect to hydroxyl or amino groups. In recurrent unit I preferably x 1 or y 1 and more preferably x 1 and y, 1, since such polymers may be prepared easily and such a structure provides a maximum of possibilities for the introduction of biocidal groups. If desiredyX 1, since substitution of the amino groups may be performed easily. From the cycloalkyl radicals R4 the cyclohexyl radical, from the alkyl radicals R4 the butyl radical and from the aryl radicals R4 the phenyl radical is preferably chosen. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a paint or other coating composition exhibiting anti fouling activity with respect to algae and barnacles, wherein at least one polymer of the invention is included as a binder in the composition during the manufacture thereof a paint or other coating composition exhibiting anti fouling activity with respect to algae and barnacles, having a content of at least one polymer of the invention, and a boat or other aquatic craft whose watercontacting surface has been protected by application thereto of a paint or other coating composition including the polymer of the invention. In an investigation, polymers having recurring units I were prepared on the basis of the results that were obtained by means of a screening test for their biocidal activity with respect to Nauplius larvae of Artenia salina.Said larvae may be cultivated easily from the eggs that are sold as brine shrimp eggs Artemia salina . Said test is described in the literature as a test for insecticidal activity. The biocidal action of a number of compounds is shown in the following table. All of sa id materials were very brittle and had very poor film forming properties. Consequently before testing them for their anti fouling action by means of a raft test on panels in the open sea usual for testing powdery materials for same purpose said compounds were mixed with a binder. Introduction to triorganotin compounds, e.g. bis tributyltin oxide, in polymeric biocides, by reacting said compounds with the free carboxyl group of the polymer provides new types of polymers that have anti fouling properties. The film forming properties and the solubility of said polymers was improved by introducing the triotganotin group. Consequently a broad variation is possible in the amount of amine and of organotin compound that may be introduced into the polymer. For example in a polymer having the following recurrent unitEMI6.1 tb CH2 CH SEP CH SEP CH SEP CH SEP CHCH CH CH tb SEP C1 O tb SEP I o SEP o SEP t SEP f o SEP c o tb Gamine SEP OSn R SEP 3 SEP SEP Amine SEP OSn R4 3 tb The carboxyl groups may be reacted not only with amines and organotin compounds in a molar ratio of 1 1, but also variations as indicated in the.following recurrent units are also possible EMI6.2 tb 4 SEP CH2 SEP SEP CH SEP f SEP rCH SEP CH O tb SEP I SEP Q SEP 1 tb SEP Amine SEP OH SEP SEP Amine SEP OH tb EMI7.1 tb CH2 SEP SEP CH SEP CH CH SEP CH CH tb SEP S SEP Ic o SEP cl c SEP t SEP L SEP l o tb SEP Amine SEP OH SEP ine SEP OSn R tb EMI7.2 tb CH2 CH SEP CM SEP CH SEP CH SEP CH2C SEP CH SEP SEP CH tb SEP I SEP I SEP I tb SEP C O SEP C O SEP t SEP C O SEP , SEP a SEP C O tb SEP I SEP C n R4 SEP 1 SEP 4 SEP 4 tb SEP Amine SEP OSn R SEP SEP OSn R SEP 3 SEP OSn R tb The panels that had been coated with the coating compositions that contained the polymers of this invention, were tested in two ways, i.e.a 30 cm below the water surface in a horizontal position in said position just algae will grow thereon b 1.5 cm below the water surface in a vertical position in said position prefentially larvae of barnacles will grow thereon . The panels were contindously controlled for a period of one year. The growth of algae or barnacles was indicated as a percentage of the surface that had been covered. It appeared that the leaching out of the amire groups at a somewhat lower pH than the pH of seawater in the open sea is very constant and long lasting. This is useful since on the one hand the pH of seawater in a harbour is lower than in the open sea and on the other hand fouling occurs more on ships in a harbour. During sailing the leaching out should not be so effective, since then algae or barnacles may not deposit themselves on the ship s hull. Calcium ions from seawater bind themselves to the carboxyl groups of the polymer and then form a barrier.In a harbour, where the pH of the water is lower, said calcium compounds hydrolyse and provide then room for a biocidal action. This is promoted by the fact that the two carboxyl groups in the polymer are positioned so near to each other. The polymers according to the invention are solid at ambient temperature. They are soluble in the solvents usually used in the paint industry. When they are applied as a coating composition solutions of about 30 weight percent are generally used. Evidently in such coating compositions also pigments, e.g. zinc oxide and copper oxide, as well as other resins may be incorporated.

Then it was heated under reflux on a water bath, After 30 minutes a deposit was formed. After 3 hours of heating and stirring the reaction mixture was cooled and the polymer obtained was separated by means of filtration, washed with benzene and dried under vacuum at 450C. Yield 235 g.Reaction of SMA with dodecylamine. 50 g. SMA were dissolved in 750 ml. tetrahydrofuran THF . A solution of 41.2 g dodecylamine in 150 ml. THF was added. Then under reflux and stirring said mixture was heated for 4 hours. The solution was concentrated by means of evaporation till a syrupy liquid was obtained.The syrup was spread out over class plates and dried in a stove. The brittle dried product was ground and washed three times with toluene and then dried again. The yield amounted to 80.3 g. 91 . N found 3.00 , calculated 3.51 .This corresponds to a conversion of 75.9 mole equivalents anhydride 0.38 eq. half amide . The biocidal polymer obtained was tested in the above described way for its anti fouling activity. After 8 weeks testing on a test raft it appeared that the algae and barnacles fouling was considerably less than on the blanks 20 against 80 100 fouling . After 42 weeks the fouling due to algae was still 20 . The blank was completely fouled by algae.Reaction of the dodecyl half amide with bistributyltinoxide. 25 g. of the half amide and 29.5 tributyltinoxide in 600 ml. xylene were heated to the boiling point for 2 hours.Then 225 ml. xylene were distilled and the water formed was removed azeotropically. After heating at the boiling temperature for another night, xylene was distilled till a viscous liquid was obtained. Said liquid was dried on a glass plate in a stove. The clear film obtained had a weight of 53.7 g. Panels coated with said mixed biocidal polymer appeared to avoid fouling by means of algae and barnacles for a period of 42 weeks in the fleet test. The blanks were fouled completely.EXAMPLE IIPreparation of di n octyl amide of SMA. 35.5 g SMA were dissolved in 500 ml. THF. A solution of 38.1 g di n octyl amine in 100 ml. THF was added. Then said mixture was heated under stirring and reflux for 4 hours. The solution was concentrated, spread out over a glass plate and dried, The yield amounted after washing with toluene 68.1 g to 92.5 . From the N percentage determination it appeared that 90 mole equivalents anhydride had been converted 0.45 eq. half amide . Upon testing of the anti fouling activity it appeared that after 8 weeks fouling by algae and barnacles was considerably less than on the blanks that were fouled substantially completely.Reaction of di n octyl half amide of SMA with bistributyltinoxide. 25 g. di n octyl half amide and 20.5 g. bistributyltinoxide in 600 ml. xylene were heated to the boiling point for 2 hours. After distillation of 225 moles of xylene, during which water was removed azeotropically, it was heated under reflux for another night. After distillation of xylene a viscous liquid was obtained which was spread over a glass plate and dried in a stove. The clear mass obtained had a weight of 43.9 g. Panels coated with a film of said mixed biocidal polymer were tested for their anti ouling properties on a raft in open sea for 42 weeks. After 11 weeks no fouling by algae and barnacles was observed, whereas the blanks were completely fouled. After 42 weeks still no fouling by algae was observed. That the polymers according to the invention are active against algae could not be predicted, since in the screening test only the activity with respect to larvae of Artemia salina were investigated. If an organic as well as an organotin compound is grafted on polystyrene maleic anhydride, likewise an antifouling activity for barnacles is obtainable.
