A cleaning device for a monochromatic copying machine 1 for processing residue toner removed by a blade assembly 60 from a photoreceptor 2 , which machine is of a type cap able of accommodating selectively a plurality of developer boxes 43 containing respective masses of toner of different colors, which device comprises a toner recovery duct 16 ex tending between a cleaning box 61 , adapted to accommo date therein the residue toner removed from the photorecep tor, and the developer box 43 for feeding the residue toner accommodated within the cleaning box towards the dev eloper box. One of the developer boxes 43 for use with the mass of black colored toner has a single chamber defined therein and communicated with the toner recovery duct when such one of the developer boxes is set in position within the copying machine, whereas each of the remaining developer boxes for use with the masses of toner of respective colors other than black has working and collecting chambers defined therein and separated by a partition wall 45 from each other. The collecting chamber 44 in each of the remaining dev eloper boxes is communicated with the toner recovery duct 16 when any one of them is set in position within the copying machine.
