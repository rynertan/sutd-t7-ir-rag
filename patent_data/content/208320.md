## Description
The present invention relates to a portable blower, and particularly to a portable blower having a vertical rotary shaft which is driven by an engine and provided at its lower end with a fan to blow or suck the dust such as fallen leaves on the ground by the blowing force or the sucking force of the fan. In a prior art portable blower, an engine cylinder is horizontally disposed, and, on both sides of the engine cylinder a carburetor and a muffler are arranged respectively. Due to this arrangement, a width of the blower is elongated to bother an operator. For instance, when the blower is hung from a shoulder of the operator by a shoulder belt, the blower will hit the waist or the thigh of the operator to hinder the handling of the blower. An air filter is usually disposed at a suction mouth of a fan of the blower to prevent the dust from entering into the blower. In the blower of a type which cools its engine by using a part of air sucked by the fan to blow the dust, the engine tends to overheat if the air filter is clogged by the dust to reduce the airflow. Whenever the blower is used for blowing the dust on the ground, a blower pipe shall be attached to the discharge mouth of blower, and the blower pipe shall be removed from the blower and stored every time after the blowing work is finished. This operation of assembling and disassembling of the blower pipe is bothersome in the prior art blower. When the blower is used for sucking the dust on the ground, a dust collecting unit shall be attached to the blower. Since the dust collecting unit is relatively bulky and heavy, it is bothersome to handle the dust collecting unit in the prior art blower. The portable blower may be used selectively for blowing the dust and for sucking the dust. Whenever the blowing operation and the sucking operation is changed, a blower pipe of the blower shall be changed from a discharge mouth to a suction mouth of the blower or vice versa. This changing operation is bothersome for an operator. If an operator wants to blow and suck the dust on the ground simultaneously, the prior art does not provide a suitable blower which can perform conveniently the simultaneous blowing and sucking operation. Further, the prior art portable blower is generally provided with projections which are used for hooking a shoulder band. When the shoulder band is not required, the projections tend to catch clothes of an operator of the blower to bother the operator. In prior art portable blower, an air filter provided for a carburetor is generally attached to and removed from the carburetor in a direction of an airflow, i.e., a direction perpendicular to a plane of the air filter. If it is required in the portable blower to arrange the carburetor above a crankcase and arrange a grip handle over the carburetor, the space for inserting and removing the air filter for the carburetor is very limited to make it difficult to clean or replace the air filter. An object of the present invention is to provide a compact portable blower having a vertical rotary shaft, a carburetor disposed on a crankcase, and a muffler disposed on an engine cylinder. Another object of the present invention is to provide a portable blower which engine is properly be cooled. A third object of the present invention is to provide a portable blower which blower pipe can conveniently be handled. A fourth object of the present invention is to provide a portable blower which can use both for blowing and sucking the dust. A fifth object of the present invention is to provide a portable blower which hooking portions for hooking a shoulder band do not project outwardly from a body of the blower. A sixth object of the present invention is to provide a portable blower which air filter for a carburetor can easily be replaced. The other object of the present invention is to provide a portable blower which can be used for blowing the dust and for sucking the dust without changing a blower pipe of the blower. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following descriptions of preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which The details of the present invention will now be described in the way of embodiments with reference to the drawings.

The blower fan 5 comprises a plurality of radial blades formed on a lower surface of the rotary plate 35. An annular wall 39 is fixed to a periphery of the rotary plate 35 and extends upwardly. A spiral air passage 43 is formed between a peripheral wall 41 of the fan casing 7 and the annular wall 39. Cross sectional areas of the spiral air passage 43 increase sequentially in a rotational direction of the rotary plate 35 as shown in Fig. 4 to communicate with a discharge mouth 45 located at the front of the fan casing 7. In the center of a lower surface of the fan casing 7, a suction mouth 47 is opened. A blower pipe not shown will be fitted to the discharge mouth 45 through a flexible pipe 49. A constitution of the engine 1 will be described with reference to Fig. 2. The crank shaft 15 is vertically supported by a bearing 51 at a lower part of the crankcase 17. At an upper end of the crank shaft 15 in the crankcase 17, a crank arm 53 is fixed. A crank pin 55 projects upwardly through the crank arm 53 and is connected with one end of a piston rod 57 which is pivotal around the crank pin 55. The other end of the piston rod 57 is connected with a piston 59, which is freely slidable in the engine cylinder 19, through a piston pin 61. The muffler 21 is fixed to the upper part of engine cylinder 19 and communicates with an exhaust port 63 which is located at the upper part of engine cylinder 19. An upper opening portion of the crankcase 17 is covered by a cap portion 65 through which a suction port 67 extends. The carburetor 23 is fixed to the suction port 67 which is provided at its lower end with a check valve 69 which opens downwardly. On top of the cylinder 19, an ignition plug 71 is provided. In operation, air is sucked through the suction mouth 47, sent through the spiral air passage 43 by the blower fan 5, passed through the discharge mouth 45, and blown from a front end of the blower pipe. An operator will carry the casing 13 by the handle 27 with one hand, and the blower pipe with the other hand to blow the dust on the ground to collect the dust. According to the above arrangement of the present invention, a compact portable blower which does not bother an operator who carries the blower is realized. Although the embodiment has been explained as a blower to blow the dust on the ground, it may be used as a dust collector in which a dust collecting case may be attached to the suction mouth 47 to collect the dust on the ground by using the sucking force of blower fan 5. The centrifugal clutch 30 may be omitted, and the crank shaft 15 can be connected directly to the rotary plate 35. A second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 5. This embodiment relates to a cooling system of the engine 1. A disk like rotary plate 35 is fixed to the lower end of rotary shaft 32 which extends through the partition wall 31. In addition to a blower fan 102 comprising a plurality of blades formed on a lower surface of the rotary plate 35 , the rotary plate 35 is provided with a cooling fan 101 which comprises a plurality of blades formed on an upper surface of the rotary plate 35 . A periphery of the rotary plate 35 is curved upwardly. The peripheral wall 41 of fan chamber 33 is formed in a spiral shape which cross sectional areas are sequentially enlarged in a rotational direction of the rotary plate 35 to form the spiral air passage 43 between an inner surface of the peripheral wall 41 and the peripheries of blades of the cooling fan 101 and blower fan 102. A partition wall 103 extends from an inner surface of the peripheral wall 41 to the vicinity of the periphery of rotary plate 35 to separate the spiral air passage 43 into a cooling air passage 104 and a working air passage 105. An air suction hole 106 is provided on the front side of the engine casing 3 to provide communication between atmosphere and the engine chamber 29. An air suction hole 107 is formed near the center of partition wall 31 on the air suction hole 106 side, and an air supply hole 108 is formed on the periphery of partition wall 31 facing the engine cylinder 19. An air discharge hole 109 is formed at a proper location on the engine casing 3 such that air from the air supply hole 108 will cool the engine cylinder 19 and be discharged through the air discharge hole 109. The working air passage 105 communicates with the discharge mouth 45. The suction mouth 47 is provided with a filter 110 and opened in the center of fan chamber 33. Upon the activation of engine 1, air is sucked by the blower fan 102 through the filter 110, and discharged from the discharge mouth 45 through the working air passage 105. On the other hand, air which enters into the engine chamber 29 through the hole 106 is sucked by the cooling fan 101 through the hole 107, supplied again into the engine chamber 29 through the hole 108, cools the periphery of engine cylinder 19, and is discharged outside through the hole 109. If the filter 110 is clogged, airflow in the working air passage 105 may be decreased, but the rotation of engine 1 will not be decreased so that airflow caused by the cooling fan 101 may not be decreased. As a result, the engine 1 will continuously be cooled to prevent the engine 1 from burning. Since the periphery of rotary plate 35 is curved upwardly, the airflow caused by the cooling fan 101 will be sent toward the hole 108, but not sent toward the working air passage 105 to decrease the cooling airflow. Due to the above arrangement, even if the filter 110 is clogged, the engine 1 will continuously and properly be cooled to prevent the engine from burning. A third embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 6. This embodiment relates to a modification of the cooling fan 101 shown in Fig. 5. An annular side plate 111 is fixed to lower ends of the blades of blower fan 102. An auxiliary fan 112 comprising a plurality of blades which are radially formed on the annular side plate 111 and between the annular side plate 111 and a bottom wall 113 of the fan chamber 33 which faces the annular side plate 111. In operation, air which escapes from the working air passage 105 to the suction mouth 47 through a gap between the annular side plate 111 and the bottom wall 113 is pushed back by the rotation of auxiliary fan 112 so that an air blowing efficiency will not be decreased. A fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 7. This embodiment relates to a modification of the rotary plate 35 shown in Fig. 5. A difference between the fourth embodiment and the third embodiment is that a periphery of a rotary plate 35 of the fourth embodiment is extended upwardly to the vicinity of the partition wall 31, and the partition wall 103 shown in Fig. 5 is omitted. The air supply hole 108 formed on the partition wall 31 shall be located inside the peripheral end of the rotary plate 35 . A fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Fig. 8. A rigid blower pipe 49 instead of the flexible pipe 49 is removably fitted to the discharge mouth 45. A front end of the blower pipe 49 is formed such that, when the handle 27 is carried by a hand, the blower pipe 49 is inclined downwardly, and the front end of blower pipe 49 is horizontal in parallel with the ground. In this using state, the blower is designed such that a couple of force caused around the handle 27 by a total weight of the blower and a couple of force caused around the handle 27 by a reaction force of air blown from the end of blower pipe 49 are balanced. Namely, the front end of blower pipe 49 is balanced at a position adjacent to the ground, when the handle 27 is carried by a hand. According to the above arrangement, air is blown horizontally out of the end of blower pipe 49 to realize an efficient blowing operation. Even if the ground is soft, the soil will not be blown out by the blowing air, because the air is blown horizontally. It is possible to enlarge a slant angle of the blower pipe 49 being held by a hand to shorten a length of the blower pipe 49 . A sixth embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 9. A cylindrical storage chamber 150 is provided besides the fan casing 7. The discharge mouth 45 is formed to open at a rear end portion of the storage chamber 150.

In the modification, the opening 557 is formed on the bottom 556 of the dust collecting case 553, and a check valve 571 is provided to an upper end of the dust suction pipe 559. The dust suction pipe 559 may be constituted to recede in the dust collecting case 553 when the lower end of dust suction pipe 559 is pressed against the ground, and to emerge from the dust collecting case 553 when such a pressing force is removed. The bottom of dust collecting case 553 may be provided with rollers to roll on the ground if the dust collecting case 553 is large and heavy. The dust collecting case 553 may have an opening on its side wall to receive the dust suction pipe 559, and a check valve may be provided at the opening formed on the side wall. The filter chamber 563 may be filled with a filtering material to pass air from the dust collecting case 553 to the suction mouth 47 through the filter chamber 563. A permeable dust collecting bag may be inserted in the dust collecting case 553 such that the collected dust will be removed together with the bag. According to the above arrangement, it is possible to blow the dust on the ground by the blower pipe 551, and, at the same time, to suck the dust on the ground by the suction pipe 559, as and when required. A tenth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 25 to 26. One end of a blower pipe 601 is pivotally connected to the discharge mouth 45 through a cylindrical portion 602. Namely, the cylindrical portion 602 which is orthogonal to the discharge mouth 45 engages with a semicylindrical recess of a supporting portion 603 which is fixed to the discharge mouth 45. Shaft portions 604 projecting outwardly from both sides of the cylindrical portion 602 engage with bearing portions 605 which are recessed on both sides of the supporting portion 603. A hole 606 is formed on the cylindrical portion 602 which communicates with the discharge mouth 45 when the blower pipe 601 is in a horizontal position. When the blower pipe 601 is in a vertical storing position, the hole 606 does not communicate with the discharge mouth 45. Semispherical projections 607 are formed on peripheries of both side surfaces of the cylindrical portion 602. Corresponding to the semispherical projections 607, semispherical recesses 608, 609, 610, and 611 are formed on inner side faces of the supporting portion 603. The projections 607 are removably engaged with the recesses 608, 609, 610, and 611 so that the blower pipe 601 takes a vertical storing position, a horizontal position, an upper inclined position, and a lower inclined position respectively. To blow the dust on the ground, the projections 607 are engaged with the recesses 609 to bring the blower pipe 601 to a horizontal position. Air from the blower fan 102 passes through the discharge mouth 45 and the hole 606, and is blown from a nozzle of the blower pipe 601 through the cylindrical portion 602. To suck the dust on the ground, the projections 607 are engaged with the recesses 608 to bring the blower pipe 601 to a vertical position and to close the hole 606. The dust on the ground is sucked by a suction pipe not shown connected to a suction port 612 of a dust collecting case 613 through a flexible pipe 614, filtered by a filter 615, and collected in the dust collecting case 613. An eleventh embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 27 and 28. In this embodiment, the blower can be used both for sucking and blowing the dust on the ground with a single blower pipe. A dust collecting portion 701 is disposed under the suction mouth 47 and communicates with it through a filter 702. A blower pipe 703 is connected to the discharge mouth 45 and communicates with the working air passage 105. A suction circuit 704 communicates through an opening 705 with a discharge circuit 706 which is orthogonal to the suction circuit 704. The discharge circuit 706 is continuous from and aligned with the discharge mouth 45. The suction circuit 704 communicates with the dust collecting portion 701 through a dust suction mouth 707. A selector valve 708 closes selectively the discharge mouth 45 and the opening 705. A shutoff valve 709 opens and closes an opening 710 which provides communication between atmosphere and the suction circuit 704. A lever 711 operates interlockingly through a linkage 712 the selector valve 708 and the shutoff valve 709 such that the suction circuit 704 is communicated with atmosphere when the blower pipe 703 is connected to the discharge circuit 706, and, when the blower pipe 703 is connected to the suction circuit 704, the suction circuit 704 is closed against atmosphere. In the blowing operation, the lever 711 is operated to open the opening 710 by the shutoff valve 709 and close the opening 705 by the selector valve 708, and then the dust on the ground is blown by air which is sucked from the opening 710 according to a rotation of the blower fan 102, enters into the dust collecting portion 701 through the suction circuit 704 and the dust suction mouth 707, and is discharged from the blower pipe 703 through the working air passage 105, discharge mouth 45, and the discharge circuit 706. In the sucking operation, the lever 711 is operated to close the opening 710 by the shutoff valve 709 and to open the opening 705 by the selector valve 708, and then the dust on the ground is sucked together with air from the blower pipe 703, enters into the dust collecting portion 701 via the opening 705, the suction circuit 704, and the dust suction mouth 707. The dust is filtered by the filter 702, and air is discharged through the filter 702, a gap between the rotary plate 35 and the partition wall 31, the hole 108, and the hole 109. Due to the above arrangement, the dust blowing work and the dust sucking work can be performed with the single blower pipe 703. A twelfth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 29 to 31. In this embodiment, the fuel tank 25 is disposed in front of the engine 1 inside the engine casing 3. A choke case 755 incorporating a choke valve not shown which is opened and closed by a choke handle 753 is fixed to a suction port 751 which is disposed and opened on an upper surface of the carburetor 23. A filter case 757 is formed integrally with the engine casing 3 and can be divided together with the engine casing 3 into a right half and a left half. The choke case 755 is supported by the filter case 757 through a rubber buffer pad 759. An airflow passage 761 communicates with the suction port 751 through the choke case 755. A net like flat filter 763 is disposed perpendicular to the airflow passage 761 and in the filter case 757. The filter 763 engages with a groove 765 and is removed therefrom by pulling the filter 763 in a direction perpendicular to the airflow passage 761. Due to the above arrangement, the filter 763 can easily be taken out of the filter case 757 without interfering with the handle 27, and cleaned. A thirteenth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 32 to 35. This embodiment relates to hooking portions of a shoulder band of the blower. In Fig. 32, the oil tank 25 is disposed in the engine chamber 29 and in front of the engine 1. Hook holes 851 and 853 are provided at an upper part of the engine casing 3. The hook holes 851 and 853 are opened on the front side and the rear side of the engine casing 3 respectively, and inclined upwardly toward the inside of the engine casing 3. Hooks 857 connected to a shoulder band 855 are inserted into the hook holes 851 and 853 respectively. One end of each hook 857 is provided with a shaft 859 to which one end of the shoulder band 855 is wound, and the other end of each hook 857 is provided with an engaging portion 861 which is engaged with the hole 851 or 853. On both sides of the engaging portion 861, there are provided engaging nails 865 which project outwardly and engage removably with engaging portions 863 which are formed inside the holes 851 and 853. Front and rear portions of each engaging nail 865 are slanted. When the shoulder band 855 is not required, the hooks 857 are pulled strongly out of the hook holes 851 and 853 such that the slanted faces of engaging nails 865 are pressed by the engaging portions 863 to remove the engaging nails 865 from the engaging portions 863. When the shoulder band 855 is required, the hooks 857 are are strongly inserted into the hook holes 851 and 853 respectively such that the slanted faces of the engaging nails 865 are pressed against the engaging portions 863 to engage the engaging nails 865 with the engaging portions 863. Figures 36 and 37 show a modification of the hooks 857 shown in Fig. 32. In this modification, the hooks 857 are bent upwardly, and the shafts 59 are positioned at the upper part of the hooks 857. Figures 38 and 39 show another modification of the hooks 857 shown in Fig. 32. In this modification, operation pieces 867 for engaging and releasing the engaging nails 865 are provided on both sides of the engaging portion 861 of each hook 857. Figures 40 to 43 show the other modification of the hooks 857 shown in Fig. 32. In this modification, the fitting nails 865 recede in and emerges from both sides of the engaging portion 861 of each hook 857, and operation pieces 867 for causing the recede and emerge of the engaging nails 865 are provided on both sides of the engaging portion 861 of each hook 857. According to the above arrangements shown in Figs. 32 to 43, the shoulder band 855 will easily be attached to or removed from the blower. When the shoulder band 855 is removed from the blower, the blower has no projecting hooks so that the blower will not catch the clothes, etc., of an operator of the blower.
