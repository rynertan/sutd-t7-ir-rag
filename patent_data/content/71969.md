## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to a fixation apparatus foran electrostatic photographic copying machine comprising a heating roller provided with a heater, a bearing for rotatably supporting said heating roller, a heating bush arranged between said bearing and said heating roller, and a gear or a sprocket for revolving said heating roller fixedly mounted on said roller.Description of the Prior Art At first, the construction of the conventional fixatic apparatus of this type will be described by reference toFIG. 5. As to FIG. 5, 13 designates a heating roller consisting of a pair of bosses consisting of a left boss 22 and a right boss 23 , a cylindrical body 24 fixedly mounted on said bosses 22 , 23 and a coating 25 made of fluorine containing resin such as Teflon Tr Mark surrounding said cylindrical body 24 and provide with a heater 26 therein. Said left boss 22 and rigl. boss 23 are provided with a heat resistant bush 29 , 29 by means of a stopper ring 28 , 28 , respective , said heating roller 13 being rotatably supported on a left side plate 18 and a right side plate 19 by means of a pair of flange bearings consisting of a left flange bearing 30 and a right flange bearing 34 put on said heat resistant bushes 29 , 29 . A gear 27 for driving said heating roller 13 although a sprocket may be used, only the cases of a gear will be described hereinafter is fixedly mounted on the outer end of said boss 23 by means of a bolt 33 engaging with a notch 32 formed in said boss 23 .The conventional gear of this type has the defect that comparatively large noises are developed when rotating in an engagement with a gear not described in the drawing since said gear 27 is fabricated from sintered alloys owing to mecitanical strength and heat resistance required for gears. Further, it has also the defect that the heat of said heating roller 13 heated by said heater 26 is lost to the outside since it has a high coefficient of thermal conductivity although it is superior in heat resistance.In addition, it has the defect that said gear 27 and said heat resistant bush 29 have to be fixedly mounted on said boss 23 of said heating roller 13 by separate means, for example said gear 27 has to be fixedly mounted by means of said bolt 33 while said heat resistant bush 29 has to be fixedly mounted by means of said stopper ring 28 and thereby the assembling work becomes complicated since said gear 27 and said heat resistant bush 29 are constructed independently. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel and useful fixation apparatus for an electrostatic photographic copying machine, which can solve the noise problem and the problem of the coefficient of thermal conductivity at a single stroke, making the integration of a gear or sprocket with a heat resistant bush possible, thereby simplifying the assembling work, and eliminating the above described defects incidental to the conventional fixation apparatus by constructing said gear or sprocket from special materials. This object is solved by the fixation apparatus for an electrostatic photographic copying machine according to the invention comprising a heating roller provided with a heater, a bearing for rotatably supporting said heating roller, a heating bush arranged between said bearing and said heating roller, and a gear or a sprocket for revolving said heating roller fixedly mounted on said roller which is characterized in that said heat resistant bush 31 and said gear 27 or sprocket are formed integrally from a resin material having a lower coefficient of thermal conductivity, an excellent heat resistance and the mechanical strength required for gears. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention said resin materials are a polyamide resin or a polyimide resin. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a sectional view showing the outline of an overall construction of an electrostatic photographic copying machine, FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing a fixation apparatus, FIG. 3 is a sectional view showing a heating roller, FIG. 4 is a disintegrated perspective view showing the main parts of a heating roller, and FIG. 5 is a sectional view showing a heating roller of the conventional construction. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below making reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 shows the outline of the construction of an electrostatic photographic copying machine provided with a fixation apparatus 1 according to the present invention. A charging apparatus 3 , an exposure apparatus 4 , a development apparatus 5 , a transfer apparatus 6 and a cleaning apparatus 7 are arranged in the circumference of a rotary drum 2 the outer circumference of which is covered with a light sensitive material. Paper supplying apparatus 8 , 9 , a paper transfer roller 10 , said fixation apparatus 1 and a paper discharging apparatus 11 are arranged in from and rear of said transfer apparatus 6 to form a copying paper transfer course 12 . FIGS. 2 to 4 show a fixation apparatus 1 according to the present invention in detail. A pressing roller 14 , which is covered with heat resistant rubber along the outer circumference thereof, is placed under said heating rolle 13 , said pressing roller 14 being rotatably supported by means of a pair of supporting members consisting of a left supporting member 15 and a right supporting member 16 . Said both supporting members 15,16 are swingably pivoted on side plates 18 , 19 by means of a shaft 17 projectedly mounted on one end thereof, elastically energized toward said heating roller 13 by means of springs 20 , 21 extending from another end thereof to said side plates 18,19 and thereby said pressing roller 14 being engaged with said heating roller 13 to press said pressing roller 14 onto said heating roller 13 .Said heating roller 13 itself consists of a pair of bosses consisting of a left boss 22 and a right boss 23 made of stainless steel, a cylindrical body 24 made of for example aluminium fixedly mounted on said bosses 22 , 23 and a coating 25 made of fluorine containing resin such as Teflon Trade Mark surrounding said cylindrical body 24 and being provided with a heater 26 therein in the same manner as the conventional ones.Said boss 22 , which is not provided with a gear 27 , is provided with a heat resistant bush 29 onthe outer circumference thereof by means of a stopper ring 28 in the same manner as the conventional ones, a flange bearing 30 being put on said heat resistant bush 19 , and said bearing 30 being fixedly mounted on said side plate 18 . On the contrary, although a heat resistant bush 31 and said gear 27 are put on said boss 23 which is provided with said gear 27 , as clearly shown inFIGS. 3, 4, said heat resistant bush 31 is fabricated integrally with said gear 27 and fixedly mounted on said boss 23 by means of a bolt 33 engaging with a notch 32 formed in said boss 23 , and a flange bearing 34 put on a heat resistant bush 31 being fixedly mounted on said side plate 19 .Said heat resistant bush 31 and said gear 27 are made of various kinds of resin for example a polyamide resin or a polyimide resin for example TONI METAL Trade Mark sold by ShinkoSangyo Co., Ltd., Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan and MELDIN Trade Mark sold by The Toyo Bearing Mfg. Co.,Ltd., Nishi ku, Osaka, Japan having a lower coefficient of thermal conductivity, an excellent heat resistance and the mechanical strength required for gears and thereby said heat resistant bush 31 can be integrally formed with said gear 27 , giving full play to the functions of each of them, respectively. Although said gear 27 is used in the above described preferred embodiment, a sprocket may be used instead of said gear 27 . As clearly shown above, in a fixation apparatus for an electrostatic photographic copying machine according to the present invention, a heat resistant bush arranged between a bearing and said heating roller and a gear or a sprocket for revolving a heating roller are made of a resin material having a lower coefficient of thermal conductivity, an excellent heat resistance and the mechanical strength required for gears and thereby the rotation of a gear or a sprocket generates remarkably smaller noises as compared with those of the prior art made of sintered alloys, making a quiet operation possible, and the quantity of heat lost through said gear of sprocket being limited to the minimum value which allows for heating said heating roller effectively. In addition, said heat resistant bush can be formed integrally with said gear or sprocket for revolving said heating roller since they are made of the same material and thereby the assembly onto said heating roller can be simply and easily achieved by means of at least one assembling means.
