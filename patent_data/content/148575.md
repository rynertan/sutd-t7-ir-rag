## Description
HORIZONTAL SMOOTH SCROLLING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A VIDEO DISPLAY GENERATOR Background of the Invention The present invention relates, in general, to the field of horizontal smooth scrolling systems and methods for use in a video display generator. More particularly, the present invention relates to a hardware implemented, horizontal smooth scrolling system and method of especial utility in conjunction with a microprocessor MPU based video display generator and provides a sophisticated video display capability without requiring a software implemented rewrite of data into memory by the MPU. Numerous systems and methods have been described which allow for the implementation of a vertical scrolling operation in a video display system. Exemplary of some of these earlier described systems in the patented art include United States Patent Number 4,141,003 issued toFelsenstein on February 20, 1979 for a Control Device forVideo Display Module United States Patent Number 4,284,988 issued to Seitz et al. on August 18, 1981 for a Control Means to Provide Slow Scrolling Positioning andSpacing in a Digital Video Display System United StatesPatent Number 4,342,991 issued to Pope et al. on August 3, 1982 for a Partial Scrolling Video Generator UnitedStates Patent Number 4,375,638 issued to O Keefe et al. onMarch 1, 1983 for a Scrolling Display Refresh MemoryAddress Generation Apparatus United States Patent Number 4,383,296 issued to Sander on May 10, 1983 for a Computer with a Memory System for Remapping a Memory having TwoMemory Output Buses for High Resolution Display withScrolling of the Displayed Characters and United StatesPatent Number 4,386,410 issued to Pandya et al on May 31, 1983 for a Display Controller for Multiple ScrollingRegions . Still other examples of vertical scrolling techniques include Stockwell, D. A., Display withPartitioned Slow Scroll , IBM Technical Disclosure BulletinVolume 23, Number 4, September 1980 at pages 1512 1513 andBush, H. E. and Leimer, J. J., Data Display TerminalDisplay Buffer Addressing for Scrolling Operations , IBMTechnical Disclosure Bulletin Volume 23, Number 6, November 1980 at pages 2507 2508. In the implementation of a vertical scrolling function, sufficient time exists between retraced scan lines for an MPU based video display system to change data in a memory array. Typically, the time between these vertical scan lines is on the order of 16 milliseconds. In a horizontal scrolling operation, however, the time between adjacent scan lines is on the order of 63 microseconds.Thus, the MPU would have to change memory locations within that time frame. Moreover, the intra character resolution required to implement a horizontal scrolling operation is one picture element PEL time which could be on the order of 60 to 70 nanoseconds. Such speeds are far too fast for current generation MPUs and seriously detract from its ability to perform other computational functions. Thus, while it has long been desirable to implement a horizontal scrolling operation to a video display system, such an operation has been extremely more difficult to implement than a vertical scrolling function.And, while it has always been highly desirable to provide a horizontal scrolling function, all prior implementations have had inherent disadvantages in speed of operation or excessive utilization of MPU operating time, requiring as they do, that the MPU rewrite the data into the memory array each time the video display was scrolled horizontally. Summary of the Invention It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved horizontal smooth scrolling system and method for use with a video display generator. It is further an object of the present invention to provide an improved horizontal smooth scrolling system and method for use with a video display generator which provides for a high speed hardware implementation of a horizontal smooth scrolling function suitable for use in high resolution video displays. It is still further an object of the present invention to provide an improved horizontal smooth scrolling system and method for use with a video display generator which allows for horizontal smooth scrolling on a pixel by pixel basis. It is still further an object of the present invention to provide an improved horizontal smooth scrolling system and method for use with a video display generator which does not require the MPU to rewrite the data into a memory array to implement a horizontal scrolling function. The foregoing and other objects are achieved in the present invention wherein there is provided a horizontal smooth scrolling system for use with a microprocessor and associated memory array which includes means for providing a serial data input to the system from the memory array beginning at a designated memory location specified by the microcomputer. Shift register means are coupled to the serial data input providing means for organizing the serial data input into a parallel data format. Scroll register means are responsive to the microcomputer for establishing a start point number for the parallel data format.Multiplexer means receive the parallel data output of the shift register means and the start point number from the scroll register means for producing a serial data output from the parallel data format beginning with the data at a start point number of pel locations from the designated memory location. Also provided is a horizontal smooth scrolling system and method for use with a microprocessor and associated memory array comprising means for inputting a data stream to the system from the memory array beginning at a designated memory location specified by the microcomputer.Also included are means responsive to the microcomputer for establishing a start point in the data stream and means coupled to the establishing means for outputting the data stream from the system beginning at the start point. Brief Description of the Drawings The above mentioned and other features and objects of the invention and the manner of attaining them will become more apparent and the invention itself will be best understood by reference to the following description of an embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein FIG. 1 is a logic flow diagram for a horizontal smooth scrolling system in accordance with the present invention and FIG.s 2A and 2B are simplified illustrations of a representative row of ASCII characters comprising a system virtual screen for display on a smaller visual screen useful in understanding the principles of the present invention. Description of a Preferred Embodiment The horizontal smooth scrolling system and method of the present invention is intended for use in a video display generator or microprocessor controlled video display generator system having an associated memory array.For purposes of the ensuing description, the terms pixel and pel may both mean picture element. Traditionally, pixel refers to the smallest physical picture element, which is the resolution of the cathode ray tube CRT being used, and pel refers to the smallest logical picture element, which is set by the rest of the video system. In this description, the term pixel will mean the element set by the horizontal and vertical screen resolutions and pel will be used to refer to all other picture elements.Further, the video display generator with which the horizontal smooth scrolling system and method of the present invention may be utilized uses a block of DRAM as a screen memory to contain the display information. The data in this screen memory may be larger than the video display system can show at one time, and this full set of data is called the virtual screen . The data which is currently being displayed on the video display is called the visual screen . By use of the present invention, a user of a video display generator may scroll smoothly through the virtual screen, moving the visual screen as little as one pixel at a time horizontally while leaving the screen memory of the DRAM memory array unchanged. Referring now to FIG. 1, a horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 in accordance with the present invention is shown. Horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 comprises in pertinent part eight pel wide shift register 12, scroll register 16, and multiplexer 18. Eight pel wide shift register 12 is utilized at low resolutions when 8 pels are fetched from the video display generator memory array during a single memory cycle a horizontal resolution of 320 pixels or less and 16 pel wide shift register 14 will additionally be used at high resolutions when 16 pels are fetched from DRAM during one memory cycle horizontal resolution of 512 or 640 pixels . To implement a horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 for a video display generator, additional eight pel wide shift registers 12, 16 pel wide shift registers 14 and multiplexers 18 may be connected as shown. Serial data from the video display generator DRAM utilized as screen memory is input to horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 on data in line 40. Serial data appearing on data in line 40 is supplied to data input line 64 of eight pel wide shift register 12 through inverter 24.Data appearing on data input line 64 is also supplied to 16 pel wide shift register 14 on data input line 66 as appropriate. Clockiny input to horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 for synchronization with the remainder of a video display generator is supplied on pel clock line 38 for input to eight pel wide shift register 12 and 16 pel wide shift register 14 through buffer 22. By means of a signal on resolution control line 42, switching may be effectuated between the use of only eight pel wide shift register 12 horizontal resolution of 256 to 320 pixels and the use of both eight pel wide shift register 12 and 16 pel wide shift register 14 horizontal resolution of 512 or 640 pixels . The function of this logic is to allow only 8 pel wide scrolling for low resolution and 16 pel wide scrolling for high resolution.Resolution control line 42 is supplied as one input to exclusive OR gate 28 having its other input connected to a source of supply voltage. The output of exclusive OR gate 28 supplys one input to exclusive OR gate 30 having its other input connected to an output of scroll register 16 as will be more fully described hereinbelow. The output of exclusive OR gate 30 is supplied as an input to inverter 26 for connection to an enabling input of eight pel wide shift register 12 and any additional eight pel wide shift registers. The output of exclusive OR gate 30 is also supplied directly to an enabling input of 16 pel wide shift register 14 and all additional 16 pel wide shift registers. An MPU in a video display generator will supply data inputs to scroll register 16 on data lines 44, 46, 48 and 50. By means of data lines 44, 46, 48 and 50, the MPU will establish a start point number within scroll register 16.This start point value is output from scroll register 16 to multiplexer 18 on scroll value lines 54, 56 and 58 as inverted through inverters 32, 34 and 36 respectively.Signals appearing on scroll value lines 54, 56 and 58 may be supplied to additional multiplexers 18 in a horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 when additional eight pel wide shift registers 12 and 16 pel wide shift registers 14 are utilized. The video display generator MPU also will supply an enabling input via external address decode logic to scroll register 16 on enable line 52 through inverter 20 when a new start point value is to be established. Serial data input to horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 on data in line 40 is placed in a parallel data format by means of eight pel wide shift register 12 and 16 pel wide shift register 14 on parallel data lines 60 for input to multiplexer 18. The output of multiplexer 18 is serialized for output on serial output line 62 for subsequent display in a video display generator. Referring additionally now to FIG.s 2A and 2B, a simplified representation of a representative row of ASCII characters from a video display generator virtual screen are shown for display on a visual screen in accordance with the technique of the horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 of the present invention. FIG. 2B, shows the visual screen being moved to the right with respect to its position inFIG. 2A which would appear to a viewer to be the characters moving, or scrolling, to the left. Each of the representative ASCII characters is shown as being eight pels wide. In operation, the MPU will generate an address to theDRAM screen memory in a video display generator which points to the location in memory for the ASCII character A . This designated memory location provides the starting address for the serial data input to be supplied on data in line 40 of the horizontal smooth scrolling system 10. At this point, the MPU can direct its computational functions elsewhere and the ASCII characters A , B , etc. will be retrieved from memory and placed in eight pel wide shift register 12 and 16 pel wide shift register 14. It should be noted, that an amount of data in excess of that to be displayed on the visual screen is clocked through the eight pel wide shift register 12 and 16 pel wide shift register 14 at all times.It should further be noted that the amount of data defining each ASCII character which is fetched from the DRAM screen memory during one MPU cycle is eight pels wide at low resolutions and 16 pels wide at high resolutions. At such high resolutions, the clocking signal to horizontal scrolling system 10 appearing on pel clock line 38 will be on the order of 14 megahertz. By means of data lines 44, 46, 48 and 50, the MPU will also write a start point number or value into scroll register 16. In the example of FIG. 2A, with a value of zero written into scroll register 16, the first pixel to be displayed on the visual screen is the leftmost pel of the character A . Thus, the visual screen will show the characters ABC . In a scrolling operation, the MPU would write a different value into scroll register 16 which would, in turn, change the signals on scroll value lines 54, 56 and 58 to multiplexer 18. With the same information still maintained in eight pel wide shift register 12 and 16 pel wide shift register 14, and with a value of four written into scroll register 16, the visual screen will display that which is shown in FIG. 2B. That is, instead of having the first pel of the character A applied to serial output line 62, the selection process begins at the fourth pel of the character A . This, in turn, allows the first four pels of the character NEw to also be displayed on the visual screen resulting in an apparent scroll to the left on a pel by pel basis. The visual screen will stay scrolled until the MPU writes a different value into scroll register 16. For a visually satisfactory display, a one pel shift may be utilized every few seconds. It should be noted, that with a low resolution signal applied to resolution control line 42, a value of between zero and seven may be written into scroll register 16 while with a high resolution signal appearing on resolution control line 42, a value of between zero and 15 may be written into scroll register 16. Suitable MPUs for use with a video display generator incorporating horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 include an MC6809E, MC68008 and an MC68000 available from MotorolaInc., assignee of the present invention. It should further be noticed that the various components of horizontal smooth scrolling system 10 may be integrated together in an integrated version of a video display generator. What has been provided therefore is an improved horizontal smooth scrolling system and method for use with a video display generator which provides for a high speed hardware implementation of a horizontal smooth scrolling function suitable for use in high resolution video displays. The horizontal smooth scrolling system of the present invention allows for horizontal smooth scrolling on a pixel by pixel basis and does not require the MPU to rewrite data in a memory array to implement a horizontal scrolling function. While there have been described above the principles of the invention in conjunction with specific apparatus, it is to be clearly understood that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation to the scope of the invention.
