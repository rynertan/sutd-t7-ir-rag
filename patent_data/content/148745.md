# Molded case circuit breaker with single solenoid operator for rectilinear handle movement.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a solenoid actuated operating device suitable for use with a molded case circuit breaker having a rectilinearly movable handle. The operating device 410 comprises a reciprocable member 486 adapted to be coupled with the circuit breaker handle 42 , a solenoid 414 comprising an electromagnet 415 forming part of a movable structure 415, 411 for moving the reciprocable member in one direction, and an armature 420 forming part of another movable structure 420, 424 for moving the reciprocable member in the op posite direction, the two movable structures being controlled in their movements by bistable latching means 520, 522 adapted to alternately latch and release the respective mov able structures.
