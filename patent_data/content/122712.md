Peptides which inhibit the secretion of gonadotropins by the pituitary gland and inhibit the release of steroids by the gonads. Administration of an effective amount prevents ovulation of female mammalian eggs and or the release of steroids by the gonads. The peptides have the structure X R₁ R₂ D Trp Ser R₅ R₆ Leu Arg Pro R₁₀ wherein X is hydrogen or an acyl group having 7 or less carbon atoms R₁ is dehydro Pro, D pGlu, D Phe, D Trp or β D NAL R₂ is Cl D Phe, F D Phe, C
