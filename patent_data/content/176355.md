# Antigen independent immunoassay system.

## Abstract
An antigen independent immunoassay system based on antibodies a Ag to a given antigen Ag uses anti idiotype antibodies a Id to the a Ag antibodies as a reference component in place of purified antigen. The a Id may be monoclonal and produced by fusing lymphocytes, from an animal in which has been grown a hybridoma tumour secreting a Ag, with myeloma cells and then isolating and cloning hybridoma cells secreting a Id.
