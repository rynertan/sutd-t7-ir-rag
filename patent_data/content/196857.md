# TRANSFORMER WINDING ARRANGEMENT ESPECIALLY FOR VIDEO DISPLAY

## Abstract
A high voltage transformer 21 such as for a video display apparatus incorporates a bobbin 10 on which a primary winding 201 is wound. Transformer auxiliary coils 202, 203, 204 , preferably wound directly over the primary winding 201 with no intermediate layers of insulation other than an insulating coating on the wire, each comprise wire turns which are evenly distributed over the full traverse of the primary winding 201 to improve magnetic coupling and simplify tuning of the transformer 21 .
