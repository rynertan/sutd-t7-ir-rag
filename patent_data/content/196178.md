# Coating process.

## Abstract
A process for the production of infra red reflecting fluorine containing tin oxide coatings on glass comprises directing on to a hot glass surface, in suspension in carrier gas, i a finely divided solid chlorine containing volatile inorganic tin IV com pound optionally containing fluorine, ii when i is fluorine free, a separate source of fluorine, and iii when i contains fluorine, an organic tin compound. Especially preferred inor ganic tin IV compounds are ammonium hexahalostannates of the formula NH₄ ₂ Sn Hal₆ wherein Hal represents halogen, being either chlorine, or a minor atomic proportion of fluorine and the balance chlorine. Use of solid inorganic tin IV compounds gives coatings of high light transmission per unit thickness.
