# COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING A BETA ANTAGONIST AND A BETA AGONIST, THEIR PREPARATION, AND THEIR USE IN TREATING OBESE HUMANS AND ANIMALS

## Abstract
A pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a β agonist and a β antagonist selected from propranolol, sotalol, atenolol, metoprolol, and salts or esters thereof, useful in the treatment of obese humans or animals. The composition is particularly useful in the treatment of an obese human, or animal suffering from a heart complaint. In which case the treatment with a β agonist alone may unacceptably aggravate the heart complaint.
