# Tire ply splice construction and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A method of making radial pneumatic tires substantially reduces or eliminates sidewall indentations in the inflated tire. A plurality of cuts 20 is made in one end of each layer of a ply fabric 10 where the ends 16, 17 of the ply fabric overlap one another to form a splice which results in the generally annular shape of the ply layer. The cuts 20 extend in a direction generally transverse to the end edge and preferably have a length which is approximately the same as the width of the overlap 18 of the cut edge with the other edge. The cuts 20 prevent overtensioning of ply cords within the ply 10, which otherwise result in sidewall indentations.
