# DEVICE IN ENCAPSULATING ELECTRIC CAPACITORS IN THERMOSETTING RESIN

## Abstract
A device in encapsulating an electric capacitor member 6 in a thermosetting resin by means of mulding without using a vacuum. The device comprises an insulating lamina 1 intended for placing in a mould 7 before the capacitor member 6 is inserted into the mould. The lamina is preformed to suit the mould and is provided with protuber ances 2, 4 on its surface to give a space between it and the inner surfaces of the mould. Furthermore, there are holes 3 made in the lamina surface facing towards the bottom surface of the mould, for allowing the flow of resin through the lamina from the volume enclosed therewith to the space between lamina and mould.
