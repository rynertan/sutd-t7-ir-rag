## Description
This invention relates to an N 3 chloro 4 isopropyl carboxamide derivative, and a selective herbi cide comprising it as an active ingredient which controls noxious weeds in the cultivation of wheat, an important gramineous crop in agriculture, effectively and selec tively by foliar application. For a control of weeds in wheat cultivation, phenoxy type herbicides have been used most widely. They include, for example, 2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2,4 D P. W. Zimmerman and A. E. Hitchcock, Contrib. Boyce Thompson Inst., Urea type herbicides such as 3 3,4 dichloro phenyl 1 methoxy 1 methylurea linuron U. S.

S. Patent 2,756,135 issued July 24, 1956 and British Patent 1,085,430 patented October 4, 1967 are very important in wheat cultivation. Since, however, most of them cause phytotoxicity to the crop, they are used mainly as a preemergence soil treating agent. When they are used as a foliar treating agent, their selec tivity differs greatly depending upon the variety of wheat, the cultivation conditions, etc. Moreover, their herbicidal spectrum does not cover all hazardous weeds in wheat cultivation, and they are usually applied as mix tures. Attempts have been made to apply 2 2 chloro 4 ethylamino s triazin 6 ylamino 2 methylpropionitrile cyanazine British Patent 1,132,306 patented October 30, 1968 , 3,4 dimethyl 2,6 dinitro N 1 ethylpropyl aniline pendimethalin German OLS 2,232,263 published January 11, 1973 , alpha,alpha,alpha trifluoro 2,6 dinitro N 2 chloroethyl N propyl p toluidine fluchloralin German OLS 2,161,879 published June 20, 1973 , and 2,4 dichloro phenyl 3 methoxycarbonyl 4 nitrophenylether bifenox U. S. Patent 3,784,635 issued January 8, 1974 as herbicides for controlling weeds in wheat cultivation. They are also used as mixtures, and when used singly, they exhibit only an insufficient efficacy against many hazardous weeds. 4 Chloro 2 butynyl N 3 chlorophenyl carbamate barban U. S. Patent 2,906,614 issued September 29, 1959 , N benzoyl N 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionic acid ethyl ester benzoylprop ethyl Dutch Patent Appli cation 6,717,715 filed July 1, 1968 , 1,2 dimethyl 3,5 diphenyl 1H pyrazolium methyl sulfate difenzoquat German OLS 2,441,504 published March 20, 1975 and 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy propionic acid methyl ester diclofop methyl German OLS 2,223,894 published December 13, 1973 are applied as agent for exclusively combatting wild oats, a very strongly hazardous weed, but their practical effect is not sufficient. Other herbicides for wheat cultivation include, for example, 3 isopropyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothiazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide bentazon South African Patent 6,705,164 patented January 23, 1968 and German OLS 1,913,850 pub lished October 1, 1970 and 2 chloro N 4 methoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonyl benzenesulfonamide chlorsulfuron U. S. Patent 4,127,660 issued November 28, 1978 which has recently aroused interest as a highly active compound. The former is a compound having high safety to wheat, but its application is limited to certain broad leaved weeds. The latter has an excellent soil treating effect at very low dosages with an outstanding residual activity, and also is highly safe to wheat. However, even at low dosages, it is likely to cause phytotoxicity to crops grown in wheat fields after harvest ing wheat. Accordingly, its use is greatly restricted. Nowadays, agricultural chemicals are required not only to have excellent activity but also to have high safety against humans and animals and their environment. Much work has been undertaken on N phenylcarbox ylic acid amide derivatives over many years, and various excellent herbicides of this type have been known and used. They are disclosed, for example, in C. W. Hoffman et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., Japanese Patent Publication No. 14240 1966 published on August 9, 1966 and German OLS 2,249,547 published on April 18, 1974 disclose the selectivity of N phenylcarboxylic acid amide derivatives for wheat, but these compounds are not entirely satisfactory in their herbicidal efficacy against weeds and their phytotoxicity to crops. In particular, German OLS 2,249,547 disclose compounds of the following general formula Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 193806 1984 published on November 2, 1984 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 23357 1985 published on February 5, 1985 disclose N 4 isopropylphenyl carboxy amide derivatives. These compounds, however, have the defect that their effects are unstable and they do not show herbicidal activity on some important weeds. It has been strongly desired therefore to develop a chemical having essential selectivity for weeds in the cultivation of important gramineous crops, particu larly wheat, a chemical which is little affected by physical factors such as soil conditions i.e., foliar treating agents , a chemical which shows an efficacy in low dosages and has a broad herbicidal spectrum ranging from gramineous weeds to broad leaved weeds, and a chemi cal which rapidly decomposes and does not exert deleteri ous effects such as environmental pollution. It is an object of this invention to provide a herbicide whose efficacy or phytotoxicity does not depend upon physical factors such as soil conditions in the cultivation of wheat which is an important gramineous crop. A more specific object of this invention is to provide a highly selective herbicide which has essential selectivity for an important gramineous crop, particu larly wheat, and produces an accurate control efficacy by simple foliar treatment in low dosages. The present inventors studied many compounds in order to develop a highly selective herbicide for im portant gramineous crops, particularly wheat, and have now found that in foliar treatment, N 3 chloro 4 isopro pylphenyl carboxamide derivatives which are preferred embodiments of the present invention can have an excellent selective herbicidal action and a very broad herbicidal spectrum while causing no phyto toxicity to important gramineous crops, particularly wheat, even when applied in very high concentrations, and that these compounds solve the various problems described above. Generally, compounds of the same series or structurally similar compounds are thought to have similar properties. But actually, it is not easy to infer such properties, and for example, by simply increasing the alkyl chain of one substituent in a herbicidal compound, the herbicidal activity of the compound against weeds or its phytotoxicity to crops varies greatly. The N 3 chloro 4 isopropylphenyl carboxamide derivatives in accordance with this invention are novel compounds represented by general formula I below A herbicide comprising an N 3 chloro 4 isopro pylphenyl carboxamide derivative in accordance with this invention having general formula I as an active ingredi ent, when applied by foliar treatment, very effectively controls most allhazardous upland farm weeds, for example strongly hazardous gramineous weeds such as wild oats Thus, the N 3 chloro 4 isopropylphenyl carbox amide derivatives of this invention have essential foliar treatment selectivity in the cultivation of important gramineous crops, particularly wheat, and can be very safely used. Various herbicides now in use in the cultivation of wheat are soil treating agents. The defects of these herbicides, that is, variations in efficacy and phytotoxicity owing to physical factors such as soil conditions, are not at all observed in the herbi cide of this invention. Furthermore, the herbicide of this invention has little effects on crops cultivated in the same field after harvesting of wheat. The N 3 chloro 4 isopropylphenyl carboxamide derivative in accordance with this invention is a novel compound, and can be easily produced by reacting 3 chloro 4 isopropylaniline with a carboxylic acid halide deriva tive of general formula II or a carboxylic acid an hydride derivative of general formula III in accordance with the following scheme. In the above scheme, R represents a 1 methyl butyl, 1 methylcyclopropyl or cyclopropyl group, and X represents a halogen atom. The reaction may be carried out in the absence of solvent or in an inert solvent. Examples of the inert solvent include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, nitriles such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, ethers such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, and aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and hexamethylphosphoramide. In using the acid halide or acid anhydride, an organic base such as tri ethylamine, pyridine, dimethylaniline or 1,8 diazabi cyclo 5,4,0 7 undecene or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate may be used, as required, as an acid binder. The reaction temperature may be 10 to 150 C, preferably 5 to 90 C, more preferably 15 to 70 C. The reaction may also be carried out at the refluxing temperature of the solvent used. The reaction time differs according to the re action temperature or the solvent used. Generally, it is 1 second to 10 hours, preferably 1 minute to 5 hours, more preferably 20 minutes to 3 hours. The rate of application of the N 3 chloro 4 isopropylphenyl carboxamide derivative of this invention can be selected according to the extent to which the growth of weeds is required to be inhibited. The standard rate of application is 0.1 to 10 kg per hectare, prefer ably 0.2 to 3 kg per hectare. The herbicide of this invention comprises the compound of general formula I as a main ingredient. The compound of formula I may be directly used against plants to be treated. Generally, however, it is used in usual formulations containing a carrier and as required other adjuvants, for example as a dust, granules, a wettable powder, an emulsifiable concentrate or a flow able agent. Examples of the carrier are inorganic materials such as clays, talc, bentonite, calcium carbonate, di atomaceous earth, zeolite and silicic anhydride, organic materials of plant origin such as wheat flour, soybean meal, starch and crystalline cellulose, polymeric com pounds such as petroleum resins, polyvinyl chloride and polyalkylene glycols, urea, and waxes. Liquid carriers such as oils, organic solvents and water may also be used. Examples of the adjuvants are a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, a sticker, and a spreader which may, as required, be used either singly or in combination. Various surface active agents, polymeric com pounds such as gelatin, albumin, sodium alginate, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol and xanthan gum, and other adjuvants may be cited as auxiliary agents which are used for the purpose of wetting, dispersion, spreading, stabi lization of components or stabilization of properties. Industrial fungicides, bactericides and moldproofing agents may be added to flowable agents for killing fungi, bacteria or molds. The surface active agents may be nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric. Examples of preferred surface active agents include products of polymerization of ethylene oxide with alkylphenols, higher alcohols, alkylnaphthols, higher fatty acids, fatty acid esters or dialkylphosphoric acid amines, a copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, alkylsulfuric acid ester salts such as sodium laurylsulfate , alkylsulfonic acid salts sodium 2 ethylhexenesulfonate , and arylsulfonic acid salts such as sodium ligninsulfonate, and sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate . The content of the compound of general formula I in the herbicide of this invention differs depending upon the formulation, and usually is 1 to 20 by weight for a dust, 20 to 90 by weight for a wettable powder, 1 to 30 by weight for granules, 1 to 50 by weight for an emulsifiable concentrate, 10 to 90 by weight for a flowable agent, and 20 to 70 by weight for a dry flow able agent. The content of the adjuvants is 0 to 80 by weight, and the amount of the carrier is obtained by subtracting the contents of the active compound and the adjuvants from 100 by weight. The herbicide of this invention may be applied in admixture with at least one other herbicide, other agricultural chemicals such as an insecticide or a plant growth regulator, a soil conditioner, and a fertilizer substance, or may be formulated into a mixed agent with such other chemicals. Sometimes, this manner of appli cation is expected to give a synergistic effect. The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically.
