# Decoder circuit.

## Abstract
A decoder circuit for a semiconductor memory device includes input terminal gates G₀₀ G₀₃ which receive address signal bits first decoder lines DL1 for decoding output signals of some of the input terminal gates, and multi emitter transistors Ga Gd, Q₇ each having emitter terminals connected to the first decoder lines and 8 collector terminal connected to a power source and to the base of a transistor Ga Gd,Q₇ which drives one of a plurality of groups of output terminal gates G₁₀ G₂₅ , the multi emitter transistors turning the driving transistor on or off depending upon the potential of the first decoder lines. Second decoder lines DL
