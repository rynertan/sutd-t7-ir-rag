# REFRACTORY COMPOSITIONS INCORPORATING REACTIVE SPINELS AND THEIR USE

## Abstract
A composition useful particularly as a mortar, coating, castable or ramming mix is disclosed comprising 1 5 to 85 percent by weight of at least one reactive magnesium aluminium oxide spinel derived by coprecipitat ing water soluble magnesium salt s and aluminium salt s in a proportion to provide from about 0.5 to about 1 magne sium atom per aluminum atom, heating the coprecipitate to between about 700 to about 1650 C to convert it to its oxide form MgAl₂O₄ which contains from about 1 to about 25 percent by weight segregated MgO phase intimately dis persed therein 2 0 to 80 percent by weight of a substantially non reactive filler material 3 1 to 20 percent by weight of an inorganic phosphate material capable of forming PO₃ n moieties on heating at above about 200 C 4 4 to 30 percent by weight water and 5 0 to 5 percent by weight handling agents.
