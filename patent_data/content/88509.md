# Separable couplings for containers.

## Abstract
A separable coupling for filling or emptying a bulk container 14 of a liquid or semi liquid food product com prises a closure 10 on the container, and a coupling member 12 attached to a supply or discharge conduit 62 and which is releasably connectable with the closure. Val ves 25, 46 on the closure and coupling member are con nected in series in the product flow path when the coupling is made. They are connected mechanically together and actuated in series so that the valve of the coupling member is actuated through the agency of the valve on the closure in a fail safe manner. Provision is made for feeding super heated steam to the part of the product flow path lying be tween the valves, so that the exposed surfaces of the clo sure and coupling member can be sterilised or purged before and after a filling or discharging operation.
