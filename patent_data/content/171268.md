# Wound dressing.

## Abstract
An absorbent, non adherent wound dressing suitable for use in deep and cavernous wounds is described. The dressing comprises an absorbent material in the form of individual pieces of a conformable, resilient, absorbent hydrophilic foam retained within a porous bag formed from an apertured ma terial. In a preferred form the foam is a hydrophilic polyurethane foam and the perforated polymeric film is a contoured net of a thermoplastic elastomeric polymer. A non woven fabric may be additionally present between the perforated polymeric film and the pieces of foam. The dressings can absorb large volumes of wound exudate without adhering to the wound.
