# Ground isolation monitoring apparatus having a protective circuit.

## Abstract
A ground isolation monitoring apparatus having a protective circuit is provided for use between an AC power source 10 and a utilization device 12 , such as an electronic instrument. The protective circuit per mits operation of the utilization device with erath ground 22 disconnected, automatically reconnecting earth grond by a relay 32, 32a if a hazardous voltage or current appears on the device chassis or exposed metal parts. The protective circuit also monitors by circuit 44 neutral 20 to earth ground 22 continuity and shuts off AC power to the utilization device by a relay 30, 30a, 30b if the ground path opens or if the impedance thereof increases. Various other features may be provided to en sure safe operation of the device.
