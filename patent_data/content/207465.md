## Description
The present invention relates to a sintered body of aluminum nitride and a process for preparing the same, more particularly to a sintered body of aluminum nitride which is dense and excellent in thermal conductivity and a process for preparing the same. Since aluminum nitride AℓN deteriorates little in strength at a room temperature to a high temperature and is exellent in chemical resistance, it is used on one hand as a heat resistant material, and on the other hand is considered to be promising as a material for heat dissipating substrates of semiconductor devices through the utilization of its properties of high thermal conductivity and good electrical insulation. AℓN having the above described properties usually has no melting point and decomposes at a high temperature of not lower than 2200 C, and therefore, it is used in the form of a sintered body except for the use as thin films. Said AℓN sintered body is usually prepared by molding and sintering an AℓN powder. However, when the AℓN powder is used singly, sinterability thereof is not good, and therefore, it is impossible to obtain a sintered body which is dense or has a high density except for the case where the hot pressing method is employed. Therefore, in the case of sintering under atmospheric pressure, it is generally practiced to add an oxide of a rare earth metal or an oxide of an alkaline earth metal as a sintering aids to the AℓN powder for the purpose of making sintered body denser. Such an addition of a sintering aids has certainly improved the density of the sintered body to a considerable degree. However, on the other hand, up to today, the thermal conductivity of such AℓN sintered bodies has been lower than that of expected due to the presence of oxygen and other impurities and of boundary area of AℓN crystal particles. Namely, there is a problem that theoretical thermal conductivity of AℓN is 320 W m k, whereas that of an AℓN sintered body is 40 W m k at highest. EP A 0114193 discloses a ceramic substrate comprising polycrystalline aluminium nitride and optionally an oxide selected from calcium, magnesium, aluminium, titanium, zirconium or rare earth metals such as yttrium. The oxide is used as a sintering aid. The specific combination of a transition metal and a rare earth as a sintering aid is not mentioned. Therefore, for the purpose of improving thermal conductivity of AℓN sintered bodies, various kinds of attempts have been made. However, no AℓN sintered bodies which are satisfactory enough have been obtained. An object of the present invention is to provide an AℓN sintered body having a high density and a high thermal conductivity and a process for preparing the same by solving the above described problems that have existed heretofore. In order to attain this object, the present inventors have investigated extensively into the relationships of sintering additives to be added to AℓN powders and to densities and thermal conductivities of the resulting sintered bodies, which led to the following findings. Namely, there has been found the fact that if sintering is carried out by adding to an AℓN powder, a transition element of Groups IVa, Va, VIa, VIIa and VIII of the periodic table or a compound containing the above elements, as a sintering aids, together with a compound of a rare earth metal and optionally a compound of an alkaline earth metal, it becomes possilble to sinter at a lower temperature than would be the case with conventional processes where an oxide of alkaline earth metal or a rare earth metal is added singly, and the resulting AℓN sintered body is dense and has a high thermal conductivity. Namely, the aluminum nitride sintered body of the present invention comprises The microscopic investigation of the AℓM sintered body of the present invention shows that in the boundary area of AℓN crystal particles, there are formed compounds such as an aluminum compound of a rare earth metal and or an aluminum compound of an alkaline earth metal and or an oxides of an aluminum compound of a rare earth metal and an alkaline earth metal and or an oxyfluoride thereof, and compounds containing a transition element of Groups IVa, Va, VIa, VIIa and VIII in the periodic table. In the AℓN sintered body described above, if a rare earth metal contained therein is, e.g., yttrium Y , said oxides of aluminum compounds thereof are compounds such as 3Y₂O₃. 5Aℓ₂O₃, Y₂O₃ Aℓ₂O₃ and the like, and also if YF₃ is added, besides the compounds composed of Y₂O₃ and Aℓ₂O₃, there is formed YOF. On the other hand, if said alkaline earth element is, e.g., calcium Ca , similarly, there are produced compounds such as 6Aℓ₂O₃ CaO, 2Aℓ₂O3 CaO, Aℓ₂O₃. CaO and the like. Further, if said transition element or compound added is Zr or ZrO₂, the compounds containing said transition element become ZrN, or an unknown phase, etc., while if said transition element or compound is Ti or TiO₂, the compounds become TiN, an unknown phase, etc. Further, in such AℓN sintered bodies, the composition ratio of the principal component, AℓN crystal particles, is preferably 80 to 99.98 by weight relative to the whole. If this composition ratio is less than 80 by weight, the characteristics of AℓN itself cannot be obtained sufficiently, whereas if the ratio exceeds 99.98 by weight, it becomes difficult to allow the additives to achieve their effects sufficiently. Next, the process for preparing an AℓN sintered body of the present invention is described hereinafter. The gist of the preparative method of the present invention comprises mixing the principal component of aluminum nitride with, as a first additive, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds containing a rare earth metal and optionally an alkaline earth metal, and as a second additive, at least one element selected from the group consisting of a transition element of Groups IVa, Va, VIa, VIIa and VIII in the periodic table or a compound containing the above elements and then molding and sintering the mixture. In the first place, as an AℓN powder, which is a principal component, the use of one which contains 0.001 to 7 by weight of oxygen is particularly preferable, when sinterability and thermal conductivity being taken into account. And, as a rare earth metal to be contained in the first additive, there may be mentioned Y, La, Ce, Sm, Dy, Nd, Gd, Pr, Ho, Er, Yb, etc., and particularly, Y, La and Ce are preferable. In addition, as an alkaline earth metal, there may be mentioned Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, etc., and particularly, Ca, Sr and Ba are preferable. One kind or two or more kinds of these elements are added to said AℓN powder. As a compound of these elements, an oxide, a nitride, a fluoride, and a substance which is converted into a compound mentioned above by sintering are preferable. As a substance which is converted into e.g., an oxide by sintering, there may be mentioned a carbonate, a nitrate, an oxalate, a hydroxide, etc. of these elements. Next, as a transition element contained in the second additive, any element may be used so long as it belongs to Groups IVa Ti, Zr and Hf , Va V, Nb and Ta , VIa Cr, Mo and W or VIIa Mn and Re , or VIII Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt , and as is the case with said first additive, one kind or two or more kinds of the above mentioned elements is or are added to said AℓN powder as a compound powder. In addition, among these transition elements, the use of an element of Group VIa, i.e. Ti, Zr or Hf gives an AℓN sintered body which has not only a high density and a good thermal conductivity but also an extremely high strength. Among them, Zr and Ti are particularly preferred. On the other hand, among the above mentioned transition elements, if one which belongs to the fourth period, or Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co or Ni, is used, at a sintering temperature lower than conventional temperatures, e.g., at 1600 to 1650 C, there can be produced an AℓN sintered body which has a high density and a good thermal conductivity. The above mentioned first and second additives are preferably added in the range of 0.01 to 18 by weight and 0.01 to 15 by weight, more preferably in the range of 0.01 to 15 by weight and 0.01 to 10 by weight, respectively, in terms of oxides of respective elements. In addition, the total amount of both the additives is preferably 0.02 to 20 by weight, more preferably 0.02 to 18 by weight. If the amounts of the additives are less than 0.01 by weight for each of them, the additives do not exert their effects sufficiently, whereas the amounts are excessively great, not only the thermal resistance and the high strength property are deteriorated but also the thermal conductivity is lowered, which is not preferable. If the amount of the second additive is great, there is a danger of the electrical insulating properties of products being disadvantageously lowered. All the average particle diameters of the AℓN powder and powders of the first and second additives are not more than 5 µm, preferably not more than 4 µm. Hereinafter, an example of the process for preparing an AℓN sintered body of the present invention will be described. In the first place, a powder composed of a rare earth metal compound and optionally an alkaline earth metal compound described above, and at least one element selected from the group consisting of Groups IVa to VIII in the periodic table or a compound containing the above elements is added, as sintering additive, to an AℓN powder, in a predetermined amount, followed by blending using a ball mill, etc. For sintering, the atmospheric pressure sintering method, the hot pressing method, etc. can be employed. When the atmospheric pressure sitnering method is employed, a binder is added to the powder mixture, and the resulting mixture is kneaded, granulated, sized, and then molded. As a molding method, press molding using a molding die, hydrostatic pressure press molding, sheet forming, etc. can be applied. And then, a molded piece is heated under a stream of N₂ gas to remove the binder, followed by atmospheric pressure sintering. The sintering temperature is normally set at 1650 to 1800 C, however, this depends on the kinds of additives used. On the other hand, when the hot pressing method is employed, direct hot pressing of said material admixed using a ball mill, etc. may be employed. Although the improving effect of the present invention on thermal conductivity of an AℓN sintered body and the lowering effect thereof on sintering temperature are unknown at present however, the cause of enhanced thermal conductivity is presumed as follows. Namely, a principal cause of enhancing the thermal conductivity is that in the AℓN sintered body of the present invention, the oxynitride of Aℓ AℓON and polytype of AℓN 27R type are hard to be formed. The results of the research by the present inventors show that all the sintered bodies in which AℓON and 27R type are formed are low in thermal conductivity. The formation of AℓON and 27R type is influenced by the purity of AℓN powder, atmosphere in a sintering furnace, and the kind and amount to be added of sintering aids. However, comparison of the sintered bodies prepared using the same AℓN powder and under the same experimental conditions shows that compared with the case where a conventional oxide of a rare earth metal and an oxide of an alkaline earth metal are added, the sintered body of the present invention has evidently less or no AℓON and 27 R type formed therein. On the other hand, the lowering of sintering temperature is presumably caused by the fact that in the present invention, sintering proceeds by producing liduid phase at a lower temperature than when an oxide of a rare earth metal or an oxide of an alkaline earth metal are added singly. Further, the sintered body of the present invention is colored by incorporating a transition element which is the second additive, and moreover, the tone can be varied depending the kinds of elements to be added, amounts and combinations thereof. Namely, in general, the molar ratio of Aℓ N in an AℓN material is not necessarily 1, and in many cases, rich in Al. Therefore, when such a material is used, the color of a sintered body becomes grey or black. In addition, usually, the richer in Aℓ the material is, the more the blackening proceeds on one hand and the lower the thermal conductivity becomes on the other hand. Accordingly, the closer to 1 the molar ratio of Aℓ N in an AℓN material is and the less amounts of impurities are contained therein, the higher the thermal conductivity becomes and the whiter or translucent sintered bodies are obtained. Namely, conventionally, if the preparation of a sintered body of a higher conductivity is attempted, the color of the resulting sintered body is necessarily white or translucent, while the preparation of a colored sintered body is attempted, thermal conductivity is lowered. In contrast, according to the present invention, the simultaneous addition of an alkaline earth metal and or a rare earth metal and a transition metal makes it possible to prepare a sintered body having various colors by suitably selecting the kind or combination of elements to be added while preserving a high thermal conductivity through the use of an AℓN material of which the molar ratio of Aℓ N is close to 1 and which has a small amount of impurities. For example, the addition of Cr₂O₃, etc. develops a dark grey color, whereas the addition of TiO₂ develops a brown color. On the other hand, the addition of Eu₂O₃, Sm₂O₃, etc. develops a pale red color and the simultaneous addition of TiO₂ and Cr₂O₃ gives a dark grey to a black sintered body. Thus, according to the present invention, it is possible to prepare an AℓN sintered body showing a desired color. The AℓN sintered body thus colored has such advantages as being higher in thermal emissivity, whereby the property of heat dissipation is further improved, a light which becomes a factor of an error of a semiconductor circuit is shielded and being able to avoid sintering uneveness, etc. during preparation by coloring, whereby the appearance of products can be enhanced. To an AℓN powder containing 3.6 by weight of oxygen as an impurity, and having an average particle diameter of 2.2 µm, there were added, as a first additive, 3 by weight of Y₂O₃ having an average particle diameter of 2.5 µm and, as a second additive, 0.5 by weight of ZrO₂ having an average particle diameter of 3 µm, and the mixture was ground and admixed using a ball mill to prepare a material. Next, to this material, there was added 7 by weight of paraffin as a binder and the resulting mixture was granulated, followed by press molding the resulting granule under a pressure of 300 kg cm² to prepare a green compact of 50 x 50 x 8 mm. This green compact was heated up to 700 C under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas to remove the paraffin. Further, the resulting compact was placed in a container made of carbon, and under nitrogen gas atmosphere, subjected to atmospheric pressure sintering at 1800 C for 2 hours. The density of the resulting AℓN sintered body was measured. Further, a disc having a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm was prepared by grinding from the sintered body, and the thermal conductivity was measured by laser flash method using the disc as a specimen. On the other hand, six square bars having a width of 4 mm, a thickness of 3 mm and a length of 40 mm were prepared by grinding from the sintered body obtained, and the three point bending strength was measured using the square bars as specimen for measuring bending strength, under the condition of a supporting points distance of 20 mm, and a crosshead velocity of 0.5 mm min. The results are shown in Table 1. By changing the kind of AℓN powder and that of sintering additive powder variously, AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to Example 1 described above, and the density, thermal conductivity and 3 point bending strength thereof were also measured. The results are shown in Table 1 together with the particle diameter and oxygen content of each AℓN powder, and the kind of additives, particle diameter and amount to be added of each additive. In the first place, to an AℓN powder containing 3.6 by weight of oxygen as an impurity and having an average particle diameter of 2.2 µm, there were added 1.5 by weight of TiO₂ having an average particle diameter of 2.8 µm, as a first additive, and 1.5 by weight of Y₂O₃ powder having an average particle diameter of 2.5 µm, as a second additive, and the resulting mixture was ground and mixed by a ball mill to prepare a material. And then, 7 by weight of paraffin was added to this material, and the resulting material was granulated, followed by press molding the granules under a pressure of 500 kg cm² into a green compact of 30 x 30 x 8 mm. Next, this green compact was heated up to 700 C under nitrogen atmosphere to remove the paraffin. Then, the resulting green compact was received into a carbon container, and subjected to atmospheric pressure sintering under nitrogen gas atmosphere, at 1700 C for 2 hours to prepare an AℓN sintered body. And as to the resulting sintered body, similarly to Example 1, the density and thermal conductivity are shown in Table 3. By changing the kind of AℓN powder and the kind of additive powder variously, AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to the above described Example 34, followed by measuring respective densities and thermal conductivities. The results are shown in Table 3, together with the particle diameter and oxygen content of each AℓN powder, the kind of additives, particle diameter and amount to be added of each additive. By changing the kind of AℓN powder and kind of sintering additive powder variously, AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to the above mentioned Example 34, and respective densities and thermal conductivities were measured similarly. The results are shown in Table 4, together with the particle diameter and oxygen content of each AℓN powder, and the kind and amount to be added of each sintering additive. To the AℓN powder used in Example 1, there were added 1.5 by weight of Y₂O₃ having an average particle diameter of 2.5 µm and 1.5 by weight of NiO having an average particle diameter of 2.5 µm, and the mixture was ground and mixed using a ball mill to prepare a material. Next, the material powder was press molded under a pressure of 500 kg cm² into a green compact having a diameter of 12 mm and a thickness of 10 mm. And then, the green compact was placed in a carbon die and sujected to hot pressing sintering under nitrogen gas atmosphere at a temperature of 1700 C and under a pressure of 400 kg cm² for one hour. Similarly to Example 1, the density and thermal conductivity of the resulting sintered body were measured, and the results are shown in Table 5. By changing the kind of AℓN powder and the kind of sintering additive powder variously, AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to the above mentioned Example 91, followed by measuring respective densities and thermal conductivities. The results are shown in Table 5, together with the particle diameter and oxygen content of each AℓN powder, the kind of additives, particle diameter and amount to be added of each additive. In the first place, to an AℓN powder containing 1.4 by weight of oxygen as an impurity and having an average particle diameter of 1.2 µm, there were added 5 by weight of mixed powder of TiO₂ and Y₂O₃ weight ratio 1 1 , and the resulting mixture was ground and mixed by ball mill to prepare a material. And then, 7 by weight of paraffin was added to this material, and the resulting material was granulated, followed by press molding the granules under a pressure of 500 kg cm² into green compacts of 30 x 30 x 8 mm. Next, these green compacts were heated up to 700 C under nitrogen gas atmosphere to remove the paraffin. Then, the resulting green compacts were placed in a carbon container, and subjected to atmospheric pressure sintering under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas, at 1600 C, 1650 C, 1700 C, 1750 C and 1800 C for 2 hours to prepare 5 kinds of AℓN sintered bodies. Five kinds of AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to Example 94 except for the use of a material prepared by adding 5 by weight of Y₂O₃ to the sane AℓN powder as used in the above mentioned Example 94. Five kinds of AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to Example 94 except for the use of a material prepared by adding 5 by weight of TiO₂ to the same AℓN powder as used in the above mentioned Example 94. Then, as to the AℓN sintered bodies of Example 94 of the present invention and Comparative examples 19 and 20, the investigation of the relationships of the densities and the thermal conductivities to sintering temperature was carried out to give the characteristic drawings shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. In addition, A in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 is a characteristic curve of Example 94 of the present invention, B is a characteristic curve of Comparative Example 19, and C is a characteristic curve of Comparative Example 20. As is clear from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the AℓN sintered bodies of the present invention can attain enhanced densities and increased thermal conductivities at lower temperatures, and the manufacturing costs thereof can be controlled to lower levels than those of conventional AℓN sintered bodies. Five kinds of AℓN sintered bodies here obtained by preparing green compacts and making sintered bodies at various temperatures similarly to Example 94 except for the addition of 5 by weight of mixed powder of NiO and Y₂O₃ weight ratio 1 1 to the same AℓN powder as used in Example 94. Five kinds of AℓN sintered bodies were prepared similarly to Example 96 except for the use of a material prepared by adding 5 by weight of NiO alone to the same AℓN powder as used in the above mentioned Example 96. Then, as to the AℓN sintered bodies of Examples 96 of the present invention and Comparative examples 19 and 22, the investigation of the relationships of the densities and the thermal conductivities to the sintering temperature was carried out to give the characteristic drawings shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. A in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 is a characteristic curve of Example 96 of the present invention, B is a characteristic curve of Comparative example 19 and C is a characteristic curve of Comparative example 22 described hereinbefore. As is clear from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, in the AℓN sintered bodies of the present invention, enhanced densities and increased thermal conductivities can be attained at lower sintering temperatures, and the manufacturing costs thereof can be controlled to lower levels than those of conventional AℓN sintered bodies. As is evident from the above description, the aluminum nitride sintered bodies of the present invention are excellent products having a high density and a good thermal conductivity. And depending on the additives to be added, particularly on the kind of transition element, said second additive, such properties as being extremely strong, being capable of being sintered at low temperatures, etc. can be given thereto. Further, depending on the kind of such transition elements and combination thereof, the present sintered bodies can be colored variously, which widens the range of use thereof as well as makes it possible to avoid lowering in yield thereof caused by non uniformity in sintering, etc. Consequently, the industrial value thereof is extremely high and useful particularly for heat dissipating substrates of semiconductor devices.
