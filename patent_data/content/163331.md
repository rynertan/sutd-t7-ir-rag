## Description
GRANULAR DETERGENT BLEACHING COMPOSITIONS Michael E. Burns Lawrence A. Gilbert TECHNICAL FIELD Th18 invention relates to granular detergent bleaching compositions. More particularly, this invention relates to detergent bleaching compositions that provide effective and efficient surface bleaching of soils in laundry processes over a wide range of bleach solution temperatures without excessive damage to dyed fabrics. The detergent bleaching compositions within the invention contain peroxygen bleaches capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions and specific bleach activators.This invention also relates to mixtures of activators that are especially useful in such compositions It has long been known that peroxygen bleaches are effec tive for stain andior soil removal from textiles, but that they are also extremely temperature dependent. Such bleaches are essen tially only practicable andlor effective in bleaching solutions, i.e., a bleach and water mixture, wherein the solution tempera ture is above about 600 C. At bleach solution temperatures of about 600C peroxygen bleaches are only partially effective and, therefore, in order to obtain a desirable level of bleaching per formance extremely high levels of peroxygen bleach must be added to the system. This is economically impracticable.As the bleach solution temperature is lowered below 600C., peroxygen bleaches are rendered ineffective, regardless of the level of peroxygen bleach added to the system. The temperature depen dence of peroxygen bleaches is significant because such bleaches are commonly used as a detergent adjuvant in textile wash pro cesses that utilize an automatic household washing machine at wash water temperatures below 600C. Such wash temperatures are utilized because of textile care and energy considerations. As a consequence of such a wash process, there has been much industrial research to develop substances, generally referred to as bleach activators, that render peroxygen bleaches effective at bleach solution temperatures below 600C. Numerous substances have been disclosed in the art as effective bleach activators. U.S Patent 4,283,301, Diehl August 11, 1981 , discloses bleaching compositions comprising a peroxygen bleach and a bleach activator of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R is an alkyl chain containing from about 5 to about 13 carbon atoms, R2is an alkyl chain containing from about 4 to about 24 carbon atoms and each Z is a leaving group as defined therein. It is preferred that such bleaches and bleach activators are present in equimolar ratios. U, S. Patent 4,412,934 discloses compositions containing bleach activators with the formulaEMI2.2 where R contains from 5 to 18 carbon atoms and L is a leaving group, the molar ratio of perborate to activator being greater than about 1.5. Said patents are incorporated herein by reference. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a granular detergent bleaching composition comprising a a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution b from about 0.1 to about 40 of a bleach activator having the general formula EMI2.3 wherein R is an alkyl group containing 9 carbon atoms in at least about 10 of the activator and the remainder of the R groups contain from about 6 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is a leaving group, the conjugate acid of which has a PKa in the range of from about 6 to about 13 c from about 1 to about 50 of detergent surfactant and d from 0 to about 70 of detergent builder, wherein the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide yielded by a to bleach activator b is greater than about 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to granular solid detergent bleaching compositions containing peroxygen bleaches capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution and specific bleach activators, hereinafter defined, at specific molar ratios of hydrogen peroxide to bleach activator. Such compositions provide extremely effective and efficient detergency and surface bleaching. The compositions are particularly effective when used to remove dingy soils from textiles. Dingy soils are soils that build up on textiles after numerous cycles of usage and washing and, thus, result in a white textile having a gray or yellow tint.These soils tend to be a blend of particulate and greasy materials. The removal of this type of soil is sometimes referred to as dingy fabric clean up . The detergent bleaching compositions of this invention provide such bleaching over a wide range of bleach solution temperatures. Such bleaching is obtained in detergent bleach solutions wherein the solution temperature is at least about 5 C. Without the bleach activator such peroxygen bleaches would be ineffective and or impracticable at temperatures below about 60 C. In U.S. Patent 4,412,934, Column 14, line 11, et seq. there is a disclosure that the C10 acyl activator of this invention is less desirable because much less 58 of the C10 acyl group converts to the percarboxylic acid than the C8 83 . However, it has now been discovered that the actual performance of the C10 acyl activator is equal to or better than that of the analagous C8 and Cg acyl bleach activators which are preferred in U.S. 4,412,934.This level of performance was totally unexpected. This discovery allows the use of mixtures of fatty acyl activators containing appreciable amounts of C10 acyl groups. As a result, separation and or purification steps can be less thorough without a loss in performance. In addition, the improvement in odor from using mixtures of activators with even small amounts of C10 acyl groups is surprisingly large. It is desirable to use at least about 10 C10 acyl groups, preferably at least about 20 , and up to 100 is feasible, without loss in performance. The most surprising advantage of using activators containingC10 acyl groups is the improvement in safety to dyed fabrics which results. When solid detergent bleach compositions comprising activated bleach systems of the type described in U.S.Patent 4,472,934 become entrapped in fabrics, there is a potential for damage to bleach sensitive dyes. Bleach activators containing C0 acyl groups provide a remarkably safe solid detergent bleach composition that gives significantly less damage to bleach sensitive dyes, even under stressed conditions than does the correspondingC8 or Cg acyl group. The molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide yielded by the peroxygen bleach to bleach activator is at least about 1. For best performance the molar ratio should be greater than about 1.5 and preferably at least about 2.0. Surprisingly, increasing such molar ratio above 1.5 results in not only faster formation of the percarboxylic acid, but, most importantly, more percarboxylic acid being formed. With a molar ratio of such components of about 1 or less there are competing chemical reactions which become a significant factor. For example, the activator may hydrolyze to carboxylic acid . before it perhydrolyzes. In addition, the percarboxylic acid that is formed can further react with the unreacted bleach activator to form a diacyl peroxide. Consequently, lower concentrations of percarboxylic acid are ultimately achieved and, therefore, bleaching performance is lowered. Such competing chemical reactions are minimized by the addition of more peroxygen bleach. Accordingly, bleaching performance is enhanced, especially for dingy fabrics. There is essentially no upper limit to such molar ratio from a bleaching standpoint because the addition of more peroxygen bleach is not detrimental to the system. However, at ratios above about 10 essentially all of the theoretical amount of percarboxylic acid that can be formed is formed. It is not economically practicable or desirable to add more peroxygen bleach. However, if one is bleaching at bleach solution temperatures wherein a bleach activator is not required to activate the peroxygen bleach, i.e., above 600C., then more peroxygen bleach can be added and it does provide an additional benefit. This is particularly true under European wash conditions that utilize a boil wash . Also, it is common for European detergent compositions to contain extremely high levels of peroxygen bleach.Based upon this, the upper limit of the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide yielded by the peroxygen bleach to bleach activator is about 500. It should be noted that such ratio can generally be expressed as the molar ratio of peroxygen bleach to bleach activator because the vast majority of peroxygen bleaches yield one mole of hydrogen peroxide per mole of peroxygen bleach. One mole of bleach activator is equal to one acyl group which can undergo perhydrolysis to form a peroxyacid. Optimum bleaching performance is obtained with detergentbleaching solutions wherein the initial pH of such solution is between about 8.5 and 10.5 and preferably between 9 and 10.3.It is preferred that such pH be greater than 9 to optimize the perhydrolysis reaction and thus surface bleaching performance, and also to help prevent the bleaching solution from having an undesirable odor. When the pH drops, however, the solution odor of C10 acyl activator is better than that of C8 or Cg acyl activators when they are used alone. With the preferred mixtures of activators, the solution odor is also much less noticeable.Such pH can be obtained with substances commonly known as buffering agents, which are optional components of the bleaching compositions herein. The following is a detailed description of the essential and the optional components of the solid detergent bleaching compositions within the invention. All percentages, parts and ratios are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The Peroxygen Bleaching Compound The peroxygen bleaching compounds useful herein are those capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution.These compounds are well known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide and the alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxide bleaching compounds such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and the like. Mixtures of two or more such bleaching compounds can also be used, if desired. Preferred peroxygen bleaching compounds include sodium perborate, commercially available in the form of mono and tetrahydrates, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide.Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is especially preferred because it is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleaching solution. It is believed that such rapid dissolution results in the formation of higher levels of peroxycarboxylic acid and, thus, enhanced surface bleaching performance. The level of peroxygen bleach within compositions of the invention is from about .1 to about 60 and preferably from about 1 to about 20 . The Bleach Activator The bleach activators within the invention have the general formula EMI6.1 wherein R is an alkyl group containing 9 carbon atoms in at least about 10 of the activator, the remainder of the alkyl groups containing from about 7 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is a leaving group, the conjugate acid of which has a pK in the range of from about 6 to about 13. L can be essentially any suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anion. This, the perhydrolysis reaction, results in the formation of the peroxycarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving group it must exert an electron attracting effect. This facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the perhydroxide anion. Leaving groups that exhibit such behavior are those in which their conjugate acid has a pK in the range of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 7 to about 11 and most preferably from about 8 to about 11. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein L is selected from the group consisting of EMI7.1 EMI7.2 and mixtures thereof and wherein R is as defined in the general formula, R2 is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, R3 is H or R2, and Y is H or a solubilizing group.The preferred solubilizing groups are SO3M, COO M, SO4M, N R34 X and NR24 0 and most preferably SO3M and C wherein R is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, M is a cation which provides solubility to the bleach activator and X is an anion which provides solubility to the bleach activator. Preferably, M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is a halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anion. The bleach activators preferably have a leaving group that contains a solubilizing group in order to assist in their dissolution. Preferred bleach activators are those of the above general formula wherein R is a mixture of linear alkyl chains. The preferred bleach activators contain R groups which are linear alkyl chains of which from about 10 to about 90 contain 9 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 20 to about 80 , andL is selected from the group consisting of EMI8.1 EMI8.2 and mixtures thereof wherein R, R2, R3 and Y are as defined above. Preferably less than about 70 , most preferably less than about 50 of the activator contains any single acyl group, for odor reasons. Particularly preferred bleach activators are those of the above preferred formulas wherein L is selected from the group consisting of EMI8.3 and mixtures thereof wherein R2 is as defined above and Y is 503M or COOLM wherein M is as defined above. The gtost preferred bleach activators have the formula EMI9.1 wherein R is a mixture of linear alkyl chain containing from about 7 to about 10 carbon atoms of which at least about 10 contain 9 carbon atoms and M is sodium or potassium. The preferred mixture of activators comprises at least two different acyl chain lengths containing from about 8 to about 10 carbon atoms R C7 to Cg , there being no one acyl chain length in more than about 70 of the activator and no less than 10 , preferably no less than 20 of the activator containing a C10 acyl chain R C9 . Particularly preferred are 60 40 mixtures ofC8 and C10 acyl chains alone and in combination with a Cg acyl chain. Mixtures of C9 and C10 acyl groups are even more preferred. These mixtures preferably have the leaving groups L which are indicated as being preferred hereinbefore, and have linear alkyl chain R groups. Such mixtures have surprisingly better odor characteristics. The level of bleach activator within the compositions of the invention is from about .1 to about 40 , preferably from about .5 to about 20 , most preferably from about 1 to about 5 .

EXAMPLE I The following granular detergent composition was prepared Sodium C alkyl sulfate 7.5 Sodium C13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 7.5 12 13 alkyl polyethoxylate6 5T 1.0 C12 alkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride 1.0 Sodium tripolyphosphate 32.0 Sodium carbonate 12.0 Sodium sulfate 10.1 Sodium silicate 1.6r 5.0 Miscellaneous e.g., perfume, optical brightener, protease enzyme, suds suppressor, chelating agent, polyethylene glycol, etc. Balance Stripped of lower ethoxylated fractions and fatty alcohol. Fabrics are prepared by splitting dirty, dingy T shirts, pillowcases, and dish towels into swatches. Terry cloth towels are preconditioned with artificial body soils so as to simulate household laundry. Other fabric swatches were stained with six different bleachable stains. Each laundry load consists of five terry cloth towels, nine dingy swatches 3 each from T shirts, pillow cases, and towels , and six different stained swatches. The laundry loads are washed in the mini wash system with a quantity of the above detergent composition that corresponds to 1250 ppm in the wash water which is typical of conventional automatic wash processes and, as required, a bleach system containing sodium perborate monohydrate and a sodium fatty acyloxybenzene sulfonate. The mini wash system with such a load simulates a conventional automatic wash process. The wash water temperature was 370C. and the rinse water temperature was 22 C. and both contained 2 gallons of water with 5 grainsigallon hardness. The following tests were carried out in the mini wash systems. In one series of tests the detergent composition was one treatment and three additional treatments contained the detergent composition and 1 1 mixtures of sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium C8 fatty acyloxybenzene sulfonate bleach activator at total concentrations of 90, 180, and 270 ppm respectively for the perborateibleach activator mixture.In a second series of tests the detergent composition was one treatment and in three additional treatments the detergent composition and mixtures of sodium perborate and sodium C10 acyloxybenzene sulfonate were used, the level of sodium perborate monohydrate being the same as in the first series of tests and the sodium C0 acyloxybenzene sulfonate being substituted for the sodium C8 acyloxybenzene sulfonate of the first series on an equal molar basis. There were four replicates of each process. For each of these bleaching systems the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide yielded by sodium perborate to bleach activator was 3. Each of the dingy swatches was then comparison graded with its original other half to determine relative stain removal. A gradingscale of 4 to 4 was used, with 4 indicating much less stain removal, 0 indicating no difference and 4 indicating much more stain removal. The average of the grades for each fabric of each mini wash system was calculated. The swatches that are felt to most accurately reflect bleach performance are dingy T shirts, pillow cases PC , and dish towels DT . These swatches were graded against the product with no bleach present. These paired comparisons were as follows Bleach activatoriperborate 45145 ppm 49 45 ppm C8 C10T shirts 2.16 1.83 PC 1.25 1.83DT t.42 1.50 1.61 1.72 difference O.tl Bleach activatoriperborate 90190 ppm 98 90 ppm C8 C10 T shirts 1.92 2.17PC 1.42 2.00DT 1.75 2.33 1.70 2.17 difference 0.47 Bleach activatoriperborate 135 135 ppm 147 135 ppm C8 C10T shirts 2.17 2.25PC 1.33 2.00DT 1.92 2.00 1.81 2.08 difference 0.27 Based on prior experience with such systems it is clear that the decanoyloxybenzene sulfonate is better, or at least equal to the octanoyloxybenzene sulfonate. EXAMPLE II The granular detergent compositions herein had the general formula Components Sodium C 14 15 alkyl sulfate 7.5 Sodium C13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 7.5 12 13 alkyl polyethoxylate6 5T 1.0 C12 al kyltrimethyl ammonium chloride 1.0 Sodium tripolyphosphate 32.0 Sodium carbonate 12.0 Sodium sulfate 10.1 Sodium perborate monohydrate 3.0 Sodium fatty acyloxybenzene sulfonate 3.0 Sodium silicate 1.6r 5.0 Miscellaneous e.g., perfume, optical brightener, chelating agent, poly ethylene glycol, etc. Balance Four colored fabrics were selected to represent those classes of dyes that are susceptible to color fading due to oxygen bleaching.The fabrics were cut into 5x5 inch swatches. 10 of the normal product usage 9.65 grams was placed into the middle of the swatch which was then folded into a pocket. The pocket was formed by folding 1 3 of the swatch over the product, folding the remaining third over the fabric and stapling closed the ends and long edge of the pocket. Enclosing the product as described allows the product to slowly dissolve during the fill and wash cycles. The different fabric swatches for each treatment were placed at the bottom of a Kenmore top loading automatic washer and then covered with 5.5 pounds of clean ballast items. City and soft water about 6 grains of calcium and magnesium hardness total were used which took about 5 minutes to fill before the 12 minute regular wash. The water temperature was 950F. Each treatment consisted of a granular detergent as described above. The acyl groups for the sodium fatty acyloxybenzene sulfonate were 100 heptanoyl C7 , octanoyl C8 , nonanoyl Cg or decanoyl C10 . Each experiment was replicated twice. The colored swatches were round robin graded against each other using a grading scale of 4 to 4 with 4 indicating much more color fading, 0 indicating no difference, and LI indicating much less color fading. The results were as follows Score Normalized to C0 Acyl Chain length 7 8 9 10 ColorlDye Type LSDg5Red Naphthol 3.3 2.4 1.6 0.0 1.2Green Direct 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.5Brown Sulfur 2.2 0.9 1.1 0.0 1.4Green Sulfur 1.8 1.6 1.9 0.0 1.2Overall Average 1.8 1.0 1.1 0.0 1.1 The decanoyl C10 variation surprisingly provides less color fading than the lower. chain lengths. EXAMPLE Ill The following granular detergent compositions were prepared Components Sodium C14 15 alkyl sulfate 7.5 Sodium C13 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate 7.5 12 13 alkyl polyethoxylate6 ST 1.0 C12 a Ikyltrirnethyl ammonium chloride 1.0 Sodium tripolyphosphate 32.0 Sodium carbonate 12.0 Sodium sulfate 10.1 Sodium perborate monohydrate As Indicated Sodium fatty acyloxybenzene sulfonate As Indicated Sodium silicate 1.6r 5.0 Miscellaneous e.g., perfume, optical brightener, chelating agent, poly ethylene glycol, enzymes, etc. Balance Fabrics, including soiled swatches, dingy fabrics, and clean ballast terry cloths, were washed in a mini washer using 1250F city water and 1500 ppm of the detergent product.The water was added first, the fabrics next and the product last. The wash cycle took 12 minutes. The 1250F is a stress condition since lower temperatures are more common and the higher temperature drives off more of the undesirable odoriferous materials. In Treatment A, the product contained 9 perborate and 3 C8 acyloxybenzene sulfonate in Treatment B, the product contained 3.5 perborate and 3 Cg acyloxybenzene sulfonate and in treatment C, the product contained 3.58 perborate and 3.0 C10 acyloxybenzene sulfonate. The solutions gave the following odor results. A s solution had a strong odor which was characterized as a sour, acidic, bleach off odor. B s solution had a strong odor which was characterized as a rancid, fatty, bleach off odor. C 5 solution had a slight odor characterized as an oily, burnt off odor. The product containing C1 0 acyloxybenzene sulfonate was clearly and surprisingly superior from an odor standpoint as compared to similar compositions containing the lower adjacent homologs.
