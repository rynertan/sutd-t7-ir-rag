## Description
Process for the interconversion of intermediates of use in the preparation of prostaglandins This invention relates to a process of interconverting certain intermediates useful in the preparation of prostaglandins. The prostaglandins are a class of naturally occurring cyclopentane derivatives whose importance in medicine is rapidly increasing. They are biologically active in many physiological systems and they or substances which antagonise their effects have potential application, for example, in the control of fertility, gastric secretion, blood pressure, blood coagulation and inflammation, the predominant type of activity depending on the precise chemical structure. A more detailed summary of their various activities is given in British Patent SpecificationNo.1,396,206. Considerable research has been carried out not only into the synthesis of natural prostaglandins but also into attempting to prepare analogues thereof having desirable a gonist or antagonist activity. In view of the complex stereochemistry of the prostaglandin molecule, such syntheses as have been developed tend to be complicated, involving a large number of steps, and means whereby the complexity of such syntheses may be reduced have considerable value. In particular, methods are required which while applicable to the manufacture of natural prostaglandins, are also applicable to the preparation of analogues and which provide flexibility in the types of prostaglandin ring structures which may be prepared. Inour Belgian Patent No. 848992 we describe s lactones of the formula I ,EMI2.1 where R represents an optionally substituted C1 12 aliphatic chain and R represents a hydroxyl protecting group as intermediates useful in the synthesis, inter alia, of natural prostaglandins. Reduction to the corresponding lactol hemiacetal permits introduction 2 of a second aliphatic chain R to yield a product of formula II , EMI2.2 wherein R and R1 have the above meanings . It will be appreciated that the terms A , D , Eand F series as used herein refer to the substitution pattern of the cyclopentanoid ring that is characteristic of the natural prostaglandins in their defined series, without regard to the identity of the chains R1 andR . The compound of formula II is thus a 9 protected prostaglandin of the F series.Oxidation of the compound of formula II yields a corresponding compound of theD series i.e. of the formula IIA , EMI3.1 It is, however, tedious to convert a compound of formula II into a prostaglandin of the E series, i.e. a compound of the formula IIB , EMI3.2 since this requires reversal of the protectea and unprotected hydroxyl groups in the F series compound of formula II . Since the prostaglandins of the A and E series are of particular interest in medicine, it would be especially desirable if the intermediate of formula could readily be converted into a compound of the Eseries which in turn can afford a compound of the A series. We have now found that when the protected hydroxy group OR of the g iactone of formula I is deprotected there is spontaneous rearrangement to the correspondingY lactone of formula III ,EMI4.1 3 where R is an optionally substituted C1 12 aliphatic chain . Where R carries a protected hydroxyl group, this may be deprotected in the above reaction in which case R3 in the product of formula III will carry a hydroxyl group in place of the original protected hydroxyl group R1 and R3 otherwise are identical. The ring hydroxyl group of the compound of formula III and any free hydroxyl groups in R3 may then be protected and the product reduced to a lactol followed 2 by introduction of an aliphatic chain R to yield a compound of the formuls IV , EMI4.2 wherein R and R have the above meanings and R is the same as R but may have different hydroxy group protection . It will be seen that the compound of formula IV differs from the compound of formula II in that the protected and free hydroxyl groups of the ring are reversed in position. Thus oxidation of the free ring hydroxyl group in the compound of formula IV , followed by deprotection of the other ring hydroxyl group yields a prostaglandin of the E series and provides increased flexibility for the process of our Belgian PatentNo. 848992. The present invention relates to the removal of the protecting group R in a lactone of formula I as defined above to form a Y lactone of formula III as defined above. As indicated, the method of the invention enables the same intermediate in the production of a prostaglandin of the D or F series to be used as an intermediate for the production of a prostaglandin of the A or E series additionally this same intermediate permits the production of prostaglandins of the F series having selective protection of the hydroxyl group at either the 9or ll position. Thus the intermediate represents a highly versatile compound. In the formulae I to IV inclusive set out herein, a broken line connected to a ring substituent means that, with the ring substantially in the plane of the page, the substituent lies below the plane of the ring a wedgeEMI5.1 connected to a ring substituent means that, with the ring substantially in the plane of the page, the substituent lies above the plane of the ring. Such formulae as used herein are to be understood to depict either or both optical isomers of each of the compounds concerned as well as mixtures of said isomers, including racemates, even though the precise structure as set out relates only to one optical isomer. The optionally substituted C1 12 aliphatic group represented by R1 may, for example, be an optionally substituted straight or branched chain alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group preferably having 3 or more carbon atoms.Substituents which may be present include phenyl, substituted phenyl e.g. substituted by methyl or trifluoomethyl , C37 cycloalkyl, C57 cycloalkenyl, halogen e.g. fluorine atoms, hydroxyl, or protected or substituted hydroxyl e.g. aliphatic or cycloaliphatic ether groups,having 1 8 carbon atoms, said aliphatic ether groups optionally containing oxygen atoms in the chain for example methoxymethyl or methoxyethoxymethyl and said cycloaliphatic ether groups optionally containing an oxygen atom in the ring as in the tetrahydropyranyloxy group tri hydrocarbyl silyl ether groups such as described hereinafter in relation to the group R aromatic ether groups such as phenoxy or substituted phenoxy e.g. substituted by halogen, methyl or trifluoromethyl or acyloxy groups derived from C14 aliphatic acids The alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chain may if desired, carry an oxo or protected oxo e.g. ketal or cyclic ketal group, or part of the chain may form part of a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl ring system. The group R1 preferably a group of formula EMI7.1 where A is trans CH CB where B is a hydrogen atom or methyl group CH2 CH2 or CC A2 is oxygen or a grouping of formula EMI7.2 where B2 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl, vinyl or ethynyl group, B3 is hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group such as defined in the group R below, and a wavy lineEMI7.3 implies either or both the R and S configurations of the carbon atomto which B2 and oB3 are attached A3 is a branched or unbranched C19 alkyl radical.optionally substituted with an oxo group, a hydroxyl or protected hydroxyl group or one or more halogen atoms e.g. fluorine a branched or unbranched C2 9 alkenyl radical or a group B4.B5 or B4.0.B5 where B4 is C15 alkylene, B5 is C57 cycloalkyl or phenyl optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms e.g. fluorine , C1 4 alkyl or C1 4 haloalkyl e.g. trifluoromethyl . Particularly preferred compounds of formula I include those in which R represents a group of formulaEMI7.4 wherein Ra has the meaning given above for R or is a hydrogen atom, Alk1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having up to 2 carbon atoms or a vinyl or ethynyl group, and Alk3 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having up to 9 carbon atoms. The protected hydroxyl group OR may, for example, be an acyloxy, tetrahydropyranyloxy, tri hydrocarbyl silyloxy or arylmethoxy group. Where OR is an acyloxy groups this will desirably be an alkanoyloxy, aralkanoyloxy or aroyloxy group, the alkanoyloxy group preferably containing not more than 7 carbon atoms e.g. an acetoxy group and the aralkanoyloxy or aroyloxy groups preferably containing not more than 20 carbon atoms and optionally being substituted by one or more C16 alkoxy groups, halogen atoms, nitro groups, Cl lO acyloxy or C27 alkoxycarbonyl groups. Where OR is a tri hydrocarbyl silyloxy group this will carry three hydrocarbon substitutents which may be the same or different selected from C16 alkyl, C26 alkenyl, C37 cycloalkyl, C7 20 aralkyl and C6 20 aryl groups. Such groups will include methyl, ethyl, npropyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, allyl, phenyl and benzyl groups. Preferred hydrocarbyl groups in the hydrocarbylsilyloxy group are C15 alkyl e.g.methyl and t butyl. Thus, trimethylsilyl and t butyldimethylsilyl ethers are particularly preferred. Where OR is an arylmethoxy group this will desirably contain up to 20 carbon atoms, eg. a benzyloxy, diphenylmethoxy or triphenylmethoxy group. Particularly useful groups OR include tri hydrocarbyl silyloxy groups and especially t butyldimethylsilyloxy groups. Deprotection of the compound of formula I will depend upon the nature of the group R. Where appropriate, deprotection may be carried out in the presence of either an acid or a base or by reduction. Thus, for example, an acyl group may be removed by alkaline hydrolysis.Where OR represents a tri hydrocarbyl silyloxy group deprotection may, for example, be effected by acid hydrolysis using, for example, dilute mineral acid or trifluoroacetic acid or by treatment with fluoride ions, employing for example, a quaternary ammonium fluoride such as tetra n butyl ammonium fluoride. Tetrahydropyranyl groups may be cleaved, e.g., by acid hydrolysis using, for example, a dilute mineral acid or trifluoroacetic acid. Arylmethyl groups may be removed by reduction, e.g. by using an alkali metal such as sodium dissolved in liquid ammonia or by hydrogenolysis using, for example, a noble metal catalyst such as platinum or palladium. According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the group OR in the compound of formula I represents a t butyldimethylsilyloxy group and deprotection is effected by means of tetra nbutyl ammonium fluoride. The subsequent rearrangement reaction occurs spontaneously to give the desired compound of formula III without the necessity of adding further reactants. It is particularly surprising that deprotection under conditions which would not be expected to cleave the lactone ring, for example acid conditions at room temperature or using fluoride ions, nevertheless yields the Y lactone spontaneously and, indeed with such rapidity that isolation of the unprotected lactone has so far not proved possible. The mild reaction conditions which can be used to effect the rearrangement permit relatively complex groups R to be present, for example side chains of the type occurring in natural prostaglandins. A number of the compounds of formula III are well known in the literature e.g. Kelly and Van Rheenen Tet. Lettr. 14 pp 1067 1070, 1976 and, as indicated above, are valuable in the synthesis of prostaglandins and prostaglandin type compounds. The following non limiting Examples serve to illustrate the present invention.
