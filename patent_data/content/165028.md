# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING ULTRA SMALL OPTICAL FIBER CABLE ASSEMBLIES

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for fabricating an optical fiber cable core assembly 11 having at least one optical fiber 18 encapsulated with an ultra small diameter metallic tube 14 are described. The optical fiber cable core assembly 11 is formed by passing a metal or metal alloy strip 12 through at least one die 28 to form the ultra small diameter tube 14 , inserting at least one optical fiber or fibers 18 into the tube 14 during the tube formation operation and passing the assembly through a sealing station 48 to seal the tube and provide a hermetic core assembly 11 . To reduce the likelihood of breaking the tube 14 and damaging the optical fiber or fibers 18 therein, the deformation energy for forming the strip 12 into the tube 14 is provided by wrapping the assembly 11 about a tensioning device 26 positioned between the tube forming station 24 and the tube sealing station 48 .
