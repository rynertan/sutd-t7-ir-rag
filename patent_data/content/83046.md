# A LAMINATED MATERIAL AND A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
A laminated packing material with a sterile surface which is protected by a protective layer joined detachably to it. On rolling up of the material web to a roll after its manufacture the turns forming the roll are joined to one another by means of an adhesive, which means that the roll will be wholly tight and consequently simple to handle during transport and storage without any danger of infection. When the laminate web is to be converted to packing containers, the turns forming the roll are separated from one another between the protective layer and the sterile surface on unwinding so that the unwound material obtains two outer sterile surfaces.
