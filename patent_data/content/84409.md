# Failed fuel detection apparatus.

## Abstract
Failed fuel detection for nuclear reactors cooled by liquid metal has a pump 11 for impelling coolant metal along sampling pipes 10 to outlet points 10a in the pipes. A rotary collector 15 is provided to scan the outlet points with a gap between the outlet points and the collector across which coolant in the sampling pipes can be impelled. The pump 11 is preferably of the helical annular linear induction type with the pipes passing through the annulus of the pump whilst being wetted internally and externally by liquid metal.
