# Vehicle speed control apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an actuator which forms part of speed control apparatus for controlling the forward speed of a vehicle, or the rotational speed of an engine, where it is desired to bring the speed control apparatus into operation at the discretion of the operator. In one embodiment, the actuator comprises a reversible electric motor 10 which receives a speed correction signal related to the difference between the actual speed and the desired speed. An electromagnetic clutch 18 is provided which includes a rotor 20 driven by the motor, and a clutch ring 22 mounted via a spring 23 from a pulley 21 having a double acting connection 27 to the throttle lever of the engine. The clutch 18 is energised on engagement of the speed control to bring the rotor and clutch ring into driving engagement, whereby the throttle lever is driven by the electric motor via the pulley and double acting connection. At any instant, the position of the clutch ring and pulley corresponds with that of the throttle lever. Therefore, as soon as the speed control is engaged, and the rotor and clutch ring are drivingly engaged, the throttle lever will be driven without delay by the reversible electric motor in accordance with the speed correction signal.
