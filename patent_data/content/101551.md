# Electrical converter.

## Abstract
An electrical converter for supplying electrical power to a load from a d.c. source and which includes semi conductor switching means 91, 92 for converting a direct input current to an alternating current and output transfor mer means T1 fed with the alternating current for changing the magnitude of the output voltage with respect to the input voltage, wherein the semi conductor means includes tran sistor means Q1, Q2 connected with a drive transformer means T2 in a configuration which provides for switching in response to saturation of at least a port of the drive transformer means T2 , and the drive transformer means includes a winding T2 3, T2 4 connected in the main cur rent circuit of the transistor means in a configuration provid ing current feed back to a drive branch T2 1, T2 2 of the circuit connected to a control electrode of the transistor means Q1, Q2 to increase the response of the transistor means to drive signals derived from the input current and effectively provide a forced D.C gain, thereby enabling a lower gain transistor means to be employed for a given minimum input voltage from the source.
