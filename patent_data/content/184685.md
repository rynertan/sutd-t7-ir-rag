# SPLIT ENGINE FOR MOTOR VEHICLES, WITH A DIVIDED CRANKSHAFT, AND AN ENGINE CROSS SHAFT FOR AUXILIARY DRIVES

## Abstract
To additionally reduce the noxious emissions of motor vehicles, the gasoline or diesel engines are splitted into a primary and a secondary engine, both having own partial crankshafts. The primary engine in conventionally used, and it drives the vehicle auxiliaries by a novel engine cross shaft, while the secondary engine is automatically started and clutched in for higher loads, and automatically separated and stopped under no load conditions. The clutching in and separation of the secondary engine is performed by a novel clutch between the two partial crankshafts, controlled by the accelerator pedal with out the driver s help, which also effects an automatical synchronization of the crank positions of the partial crank shafts. An additional hand switch can exclude the clutching in of the secondary engine for motor queuings. The split engine establishes a whole engine family, contributes a multiplicative reduction of noxious emissions, saves additionally fuel, and enables economy priced engine optionals.
