## Description
Adenine Derivatives possessing Pharmacoloqical Activity The present invention relates to derivatives of adenine having hypolipidaemic activity, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine. The present invention provides the compounds of the formulae I and II and salts thereof EMI1.1 wherein R is an optionally substituted group of formula III EMI2.1 wherein X is an oxygen or sulphur atom and n is 1, 2 or 3.any substituents being selected from C14 alkyl groups C1 4 polymethylene groups attached to two different atoms thus forming a bicyclic ring system, and polymethylene groups attached to one carbon atom thus forming a spirocycloalkyl group, provided that R is other than an unsubstituted morpholine group. Suitable examples of R include substituted morpholino and substituted or unsubstituted thiomorpholino groups. Preferably n is 2. Suitable example of C14 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, nt and iso propyl and n butyl. Methyl groups are preferred. When two or more alkyl substituents are present they are preferably the same. When two or more alkyl substituents are present they may be on the same or different carbon atoms. Suitable examples of a C14 polymethylene bridging group include ethan l,2 diyl and propan 1,3 diyl. When a bridging group is present, preferably the bridgehead carbon atoms are unsubstituted. Suitable examples of a C25 polymethylene spirocycloalkyl group include spirocyclopentyl. When a polymethylene bridging or spirocycloalkyl group is present, it is preferred that there are no other substituents present. Compounds of formulae I and II have an asymmetric carbon atom ie that bearing the hydroxyl group and may thus exist in at least two stereoisomeric forms. The group R may also include one or more asymmetric carbon atoms. The present invention encompasses all streoisomeric forms of the compounds of formulae I and II whether free from other stereoisomers or admixed with other stereoisomers.It, therefore, includes optically pure enantiomers and racemic mixtures thereof. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated by conventional methods or produced by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The compounds of this invention may be provided in the form of solvates such as hydrates. The salts of the compounds of formulae I and II include acid addition salts and these are preferably acid addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids.Such acids may be inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, orthophosphoric, sulphuric, methanesulphonic, acetic, citric, lactic, tartaric, propionic, benzoic and fumaric acids. The salts of the compounds of the formulae I and II also include pharmaceutically acceptable quaternary ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include such compounds quaternised by compounds such as R5 Y whereinR5 is C1 6 alkyl, phenyl C1 6 alkyl, C5 7 cycloalkyl, or in vivo hydrolysable substituted C1 4 alkyl groups andY is an anion of an acid. Suitable examples of R5 include methyl, ethyl andn and iso propyl and benzyl and phenylethyl. Examples of substituted C14 alkyl groups which hydrolyse readily in the body to produce the parent amine include acyloxyalkyl groups such as acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a acetoxyethyl, a acetoxybenzyl and a pivaloyloxyethyl groups and alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl groups, such as ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl and a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl. Suitable examples of Y include the halides such as chloride, bromide and iodide. Crystalline acid addition salts are particularly apt. It will be appreciated that one group of compounds of formulae I and II which are of particular interest are those wherein R is a substituted or unsubstituted monocyclic group. A further group of compounds of particular interest are those wherein R is an unsubstituted bicyclic group. Examples of compounds of formula I include 6 amino 9 2 hydroxy 3 thiomorpholino propyl purine, and 6 amino 9 2 hydroxy 3 2,6 cis dimethylmorpholino propyl purine. Examples of compounds of formula II include 6 amino 3 t 2 hydroxy 3 thiomorpholino propyl purinq, and 6 amino 3 2 hydroxy 3 2,6 cis dimethylmorpholino propyl purine. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or II as hereinbefore defined, which process comprises a. the reaction of adenine or a metal salt thereof with a compound of the formula VIII Z CH2 CHA CH2 R vIII wherein R is as defined in formulae I and it and A is hydroxyl and Z is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile or A and Z together form an oxide diradical, or b. the reaction of a compound of the formula IX orEMI5.1 wherein A and Z are as hereinbefore defined1 with a compound of the formula XI H R xI wherein R is as defined in formulae I and II or c the reduction of a compound of the formula XII or XIII EMI6.1 wherein R is as defined in formulae I and II or d. the deprotection of an N or 0 protected compound corresponding to a compound of the formula I or II or e. for a compound of the formula I , the reaction of formamide with a compound of the formula XIV EMI6.2 wherein R is as defined in formulae I and II and optionally thereafter salifying the compound of the formula I or II so produced. Process variants a and d are preferred processes of the invention. In process variant a suitable examples of Z when a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile include halogen atoms such as bromine or chlorine, and activated ester residues such as methanesulphonyloxy or toluenesulphonyloxy. If adenine per se is employed in process variant a then an inorganic base, for example an alkali metal base such as the hydroxide or carbonate, for example potassium hydroxide or carbonate, is used to form a metal salt in situ, alternatively, a pre formed metal salt, for example the potassium salt, is used. The reaction is usually carried out in a lower alkanol such as ethanol or isopropanol at an elevated temperature such as at reflux. The crude product may be obtained by evaporation of the filtered reaction mixture. This initial product may be purified by conventional methods such as re crystallisation. The reaction of process variant a results in the preparation of compounds of the formulae I and II c.f.J.H. Lister, The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds Fused Pyrimidines, Part II Purines Wiley Interscience, 1971 , and this process thus also comprises the optional separation of the compounds of formulae I and II by conventional means. If both salification and separation are carried out, then they may be carried out in any appropriate order. Separation of the compounds of the formulae I and II may be effected by column chromatography, for example over silica using a solvent such as chloroform or ethyl acetate optionally in the presence of a lower alkanol such as methanol. It will be apparent that optional salification appropriately follows separation in such a case. Reaction conditions for process variant b are substantially those for variant a. The presence of base is optional, but preferred when Z is halogen. Excess of the compound of formula XI may be used as an alternative base. For process variant c, suitable examples of reducing agents include borohydrides, such as sodium or lithium borohydrides, which may be used in a solvent such as diglyme, a lower alcohol or an ether, at non extreme temperatures, such as ambient temperature. Process variant e is suitably carried out analogously to the methods of Bredereck et al., given in Chem. Ber., 86, 333, 1953 and U.K. Patent No. 706,424. Process variant d is preferred for the preparation of compounds of the formula I in particular when the process comprises the removal of the oxide radical from a compound of the formula XV EMI9.1 The reaction may be carried out by catalytic hydrogenolysis, for example in the presence of Raney nickel. Such catalytic hydrogenolysis may be carried out with hydrogen at or in slight excess of atmospheric pressure at non extreme temperatures, for example ambient temperature, in an inert polar solvent, such as a lower alkanol, for example ethanol. Compounds of the formula XV may be prepared by the reaction of adenine l oxide with a compound of the formula VIII as hereinbefore defined, under the reaction conditions described for process variant a. When a compound of the formula I or II is capable of existing as a number of diastereomers as discussed hereinbefore, a mixture of isomers of the compound of the formula I or II may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography or alternatively the pure isomer may if desired be synthesised from the corresponding isomeric form of the relevant starting material, e.g. compounds of the formulae VIII or XI . Isomeric forms of the compounds of the formulae VIII or XI are eithex known as separate forms or may be separated or resolved conventionally e.g. by chromatography. Racemates of compounds of the formulae I or II or VIII or XI may be resolved conventionally, e.g. by salification with a chiral acid and separation of the resultant salts, for example as in L.F. Fieser andM. Fieser, Organic Chemistry , 3rd Ed., 1956, Reinhold S.H. Wilen Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions ,University of Notre Dame Press, 1972, or S.H. Wilen, Topics inStereochemistry , 1971, Vol. 6, John Wiley, NY. The free bases of the compounds of the formulae i and II may be salified by treatment with an acid or treatment with a compound R5Y as hereinbefore defined. In general, within acid addition salts, di salts are preferred, since they are more easily prepared using, a sliaht excess of the relevant acid. It will also be realised that salts of the compounds of the formulae I and II which are not pharmaceutically acceptable may be useful as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the formulae I and II or the compounds of the formulae I and II themselves, and as such form an aspect of the present invention. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of this invention as hereinbefore described together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefore. Preferred compositions are in a form suitable for oral administration. Oral dosage forms may contain such conventional excipients such as fillers, lubricants, disintegrants, binders, preservatives, colourants and so on. Suitable fillers include lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, mannitol and the like. Suitable lubricants include magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Suitable disintegrants include polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and sodium starch glycollate.. The oral dosage forms are normally provided as discrete unit forms such as tablets and capsules. In general such unit dosage forms will contain from 5 to 500 mgs and more usually from 25 to 300 mgs. These unit dosage forms may be administered form 1 to 6 times daily in such a way that the daily dose for a 70 kg adult will normally be between 30 to 1500 mgs and more usually from 100 to 1000 mgs, for example from 200 to 800 mgs.The present invention furtherprovides a method of treating hyperlipidaemia in humans which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or II to a hyperlipidaemic human.The following examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the invention and the preparation of intermediates therefore.
