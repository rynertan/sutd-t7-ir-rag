# DEVICE FOR A SUSPENDED CEILING STRUCTURE FOR RECTANGULAR FILTER ELEMENTS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for a suspended ceiling structure 1 for rectangular filter elements 2, 3 . Some filter elements are located at a distance from each other to allow the suspension of objects 6 , e.g. lightning fittings, from the suspended ceiling structure. An air stream is forced to flow out from the filter elements in the direction downwards towards the floor and vanes 8, 9 are then arranged substantially at the same level as and adjacent to at least one of those lateral surfaces of the objects, which face the filter elements. The vanes are arranged at an angle to the air stream in such a way that the air is deflected and is made to flow towards a region 10 immediately below the lightning fitting.

## Description
The present invention relates to a device for a suspended cealing structure for rectangular filter elements, wherein at least some filter elements are located at a distance from each other in order to allow therebetween the suspension of objects such as lightning fittings or the like from the suspended ceiling structure and in addition an air stream is arranged to flow out through the filter elements and downwards towards the floor. Suspended ceiling structures of the above mentioned type are above all used in clean rooms and in these turbulence problems below, for instance a lightning fitting, has caused great problems, since particles are captured and forced to circulate within a region immediately below the lamp, so that they can spread uncontrollably in the room. It has been established that in a room with a laminar air flow from the filter elements downwards towards the floor, turbulent regions are produced below the lightning fittings down to a distance from the fitting of approximately three times the width of the fitting. This means that all particles produced in the region flow back upwards towards the ceiling and are mixed with the clean filtered air, whereby the cleanness of the whole room will be heavily impaired. Until now these problems have been solved by providing a suspended ceiling consisting of a great number of small tubes of plastics or glass material, which are placed on their ends to form a continuous body and the suspended ceiling is composed of these bodies which thereby prevent the occurrence of turbulent regions below the lightning fittings. However, this solution is extremely expensive as far as the material and the installation is concerned and the object of the present invention is to provide a structure which completely eliminates the need for an extra suspended ceiling and at the same time efficiently prevents the occurrence of turbulent regions below the lightning fittings or other objects suspended from the ceiling. This object is realized according to the invention essentially by the provision of vanes arranged substantially at the same level as and adjacent to at least one of those lateral surfaces of the suspended objects, which face the filter elements, which vanes are arranged at an angle to the air stream to make the air flow towards a region immediately below each of the suspended objects, whereby the occurrence of turbulent regions below the suspended objects is substantially eliminated. An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described more in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a section through a suspended ceiling structure with filter elements and with a lightning fitting placed between the elements and the turbulent region produced beneath the lightning fitting, Fig. 2 shows the suspended ceiling structure according to Fig. 1 with a device according to the invention placed on the filter elements and the flow pattern resulting herefrom, Fig. 3 shows the device according to Fig. 2 adapted to a pendulum suspended lightning fitting, and Fig. 4 shows a front view of a filter element with the device according to the invention attached to it. In Fig. 1 a suspended ceiling structure is shown consisting of U shaped bars 1, which are suspended from the ceiling not shown and which in their turn carry rectangular filter elements 2 and 3, provided with support bars 4 and 5 respectively at their long sides. Between the filter elements and on the lower side of the suspended ceiling bar 1 a lightning fitting 6 is attached. The distance between the filter elements is denoted by B in the figure and the air streams resulting from this suspended ceiling structure are indicated with arrows. The air stream passing through the filters has a laminar flow downwards towards the floor. Below the lightning fitting 6 there is a region 7, in which turbulence arises and this region has a size substantially corresponding to the width B of the fitting and a height H equal to B 3. Thus, within this region possible particles are retained and in the interface between the turbulent and the laminar flow these particles can be ejected into the clean filtered air, thereby being spread into the room. In Fig. 2 a device according to the invention has been installed and in this case it consists of two vanes 8 and 9 arranged at the lower sides of the filter elements 2 and 3 and essentially parallel to and adjacent to those sides of the lightning fitting 6 which face the filter elements. The vanes are oriented at an angle to the air stream in order to deflect the air and make it stream towards the region 10 immediately below the lightning fitting 6. In this way the occurrence of turbulent air streams below the lightning fittning as described in connection with Fig. 1 is prevented. As a matter of fact, perpendicularly below the lightning fitting a higher air velocity is attained than in the laminar flow produced beneath the filter elements. Fig. 3 shows how the vanes 8 and 9 are carried by a lightning fitting 6, which is suspended in a bar or pendulum 11, whereby the air stream from the filter elements is forced to flow towards the region 10. The width of the U bar 1 can be made significantly smaller in this case in order to avoid formation of turbulence in the region below the bar. The vanes can have different shapes and in Fig. 4 an embodiment is shown in which the bars are arranged as a frame positioned within and essentially parallel to the edges of the filter element. The vanes 8 and 9 in Fig. 2 are placed on each side of the lightning fitting 6, but with an appropriate length and angle to the air stream the technical effect of the invention could be attained if the air stream is deflected by a single vane attached to one of the two filter elements 2 or 3. The angular orientation of the vanes, the distance of the vanes from the lightning fitting and their length have to be adapted to the air velocities and the air volumes intended for each real installation.
