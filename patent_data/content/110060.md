## Abstract
MOS semiconductor address buffer for converting TTL logic states to a MOS logic state requiring only a single clock and having improved power efficiency. The address buffer operates in response to the single clock pulse csi, The buffer comprises a bistable input circuit 15 to which the TTL logic signals are supplied through transistors 22, 23 and two inverter output circuits 18, 19 providing complementary MOS logic level signals at terminals 64, 65 . The output node N1 of the bistable circuit 15 is connected via transistors 38, 39 to the input N3 of output circuit 18 and the node N2 is connected via transistors 41, 43 to the input N4 of output circuit 19 . Inputs N3, N4 are respectively connected to the ground line GND via transistors 47, 45 . Timing selection signals csi and
