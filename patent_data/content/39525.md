# METHOD AND PLANT FOR CONVERTING FLY ASH AND OTHER POWDERY INDUSTRIAL REFUSE INTO MANUFACTURED BLOCKS SUITABLE FOR DISCHARGE INTO THE SEA

## Abstract
In a ship there are provided a plurality of refriger ated cells 10 in which fly ash or other powdery refuse is mixed with water the temperature being progres sively lowered in the refrigerated cell until the mixture changes state from substantially liquid to solid, i.e. to ice the walls 18 of the refrigerated cell 10 are then successively heated in order to melt the ice layer which adheres thereto finally, a lower door 13 of the cell 10 is opened to cause the ice block to fall into the sea. The ice block must be such as to sink without dis solving even to a minimum extent during its fall to wards the sea bed, so as not to spread the fly ash through the entire surrounding sea. In order to attain this, the weight of the quantity of fly ash, present in unit volume of the mixture, must be in such a ratio that the weight of the volume of liquid displaced during the fall of the block towards the sea bed is less than the weight of the block itself.
