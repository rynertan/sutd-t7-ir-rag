## Description
An insulation panel and a vertical and horizontal tie means for use with the panel This invention relates to the construction of thermally insulated walls and ceilings for buildings. It is known to form an insulated concrete wall in situ by erecting a plurality of superimposed courses of moulds.Each mould consists of two spaced panels of foamed polymeric material having fire resistant connecting members embedded in projections integrally formed on inner faces of said panels. The members interconnect the panels transversely to define at least one vertical cavity extending throughout the mould to the adjacent courses of moulds. The cavities can then be filled with concrete which when set results in an insulated wall. These moulds are preformed blocks which have to be transported to a construction site which, because of their bulk wastes carriage space and increases the risk of damage in transit, This increases costs and slows construction. These moulds have no mechanical connections between each block and rely solely on the friction grip of a tongue and groove edging on each mould. This means that the concrete has to be poured into one course at a time and cannot be pumped into the course with the usual apparatus.because of the vibration which it creates. Some sort of vertical strapping is required to avoid the moulds rising out of horizontal alignment during construction. Factory application of finishes is made difficult because of the bnlk of the moulds which create handling problems. The impact resistance of these moulds is low because they are formed in low density polymeric material. Other uses as conventional cladding and shuttering are impossible because they are complete preformed units which means that they cannot be removed after the concrete is set and also do not allow for single panel use. Structural design in accordance with British Standard Code of Practice CUP110 cannot be followed because of the internal shape of these moulds, and the required cover of reinforcing bars to give fire resistance cannot be achieved. Independant fire reports are then necessary to comply with building regulations. Accessories to achieve built in corner beads for strength are not possible because of the internal shape of the moulds. An object of the present invention is to obviate or mitigate the aforesaid disadvantages. According to the present invention there is provided a thermal insulating panel for use in the construction of walls and ceilings comprising a sheet of expanded foam plastics material characterised in that edges are provided with recesses which are adapted to receive a vertical and horizontal tie means for tying adjacent panels together and fixing same to a wall or ceiling. The recesses in the panel are preferably in the form of T slots. The panel is conveniently formed from expanded polystyrene foam but polyurethane, urea and phenol formaldehyde foams and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene structural foams may also be used. The panel may have a factory applied finish such as aluminium foil to control flame spread, paint to avoid interstitial penetration of condensation or cementatious coating to improve weathering. Alternatively the panels may be finished on site whilst in position on a wall. Further according to the present invention there is provided a vertical and horizontal tie means for use with the panel which is characterised in that an element which is cooperable with recesses in the panel has at least one member extending from one surface of the element. The element is preferably a plate which may be formed by injection moulding of a thermoplastic. Such as polyvinyl chloride P. V. C. acrylonitrile butadiene styrene A. B. S. polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene P.T.F.E. and polyamides such as Nylon. The member can be made of the same material as the plate or may differ in order to meet fire regulations or improve structural characteristics. Thus the member can be formed from wire, mild steel sheeting or rods, bars or tubes of plastics material. In each case the method of joining the member to the plate may be a simple mechanical fixing e.g. by providing a lug at one end of the member and a corresponding aperture in the plate so that upon inserting the lug carrying end of the member into the aperture and twisting the member through a half turn it locks into position. Where a thermoplastic is used for both components they may be welded together. A pair of panels may be connected in parallel to provide a free standing structural unit using a duplex member formed by connecting a pair of opposed plates with at least one member but, preferably with four such members. The present invention will now be described by way ofExample with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a view of one face of a panel according to this invention showing tongue and groove edge formations and recesses for receiving vertical and horizontal tie means Fig. 2 is a view of the other face of the panel shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is an edge view of the panel shown in Fig. 1 showing the T slot configuration of the recesses and grooved formation of that edge Fig. 4 is an edge view of the opposite edge of the panel to that shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a section through A A of Fig. 1 Fig. 6 is also a section through A A of Fig. 1 where vertical and horizontal tie means are fitted in the recesses Fig. 7 is an end view of the panel shown in Fig.I Fig. 8 is a view of one face of the vertical and horizontal tie means previously shown fitted in recesses of the panel in Fig. 6 Fig. 9 is a side view of the vertical and horizontal tie means shown in Fig. 8 Fig. 10 is an end view of the vertical and horizontal tie means shown in Figs. 8 and 9 Fig. 11 is an enlarged view of one face of a plate forming part of the vertical and horizontal tie means of this invention showing detail of strengthening ribbing Fig. 12 is a section through X X of Fig. 11 Fig. 13 is a view of the reverse face of the plate shown in Fig. 11 Fig. 14 is a section through B B of Fig. 11 Fig. 15 is a section through C C of Fig. 11 Fig. 16 is a section through D D of Fig. 13 Fig. 17 is a section through E E of Fig. 13 Fig. 18 is a side view of a member forming part of the vertical and horizontal tie means of this invention, which is formed from steel wire Fig. 19 is a side view of another member which can be used to form the vertical and horizontal tie means of this invention, and which in this case is made from mild steel plate Fig. 20 is a side view of a polyvinyl chloride tube P.V.C. which can be used as a connecting member in the vertical and horizontal tie means of this invention and Fig. 21 is a side view of a moulded P.V.C. rod with deformable snap fit f end portions which can be used as a connecting member in the vertical and horizontal tie means of this invention.Example 1 In a first embodiment of the invention panels 1 moulded from polystyrene are used to form concrete shuttering. Each panel 1 is of rectangular shape and each edge thereof is provided with conventional tongue 2 and groove 3 means to facilitate edge to edge alignment of adjacent panels 1. Two opposing edges 4,5 which will form the upper 4 and lower 5 edges of the panel 1 in use are provided with recesses 6 to accomodate vertical and horizontal tie means. In this embodiment the vertical tie means comprises an elongate plate 7 whose width tapers from the middle 8 towards an arcuate shaped tip 9 at either end. The plate 7 is formed by injection moulding of P.V.C.to provide a plate which has a thick narrow central portion 10 surrounded by thinner material strengthened by ribbing 11 extending outwards to the border of the plate. The central portion 10 is provided with apertures 12, into which a horizontal tie may be fixed. The horizontal tie in this embodiment consists of aP.V.C. rod 13 provided with a lug protruding radially from either end so that when an end of the rod 13 is located in an aperture 12 in the plate 7 and twisted through a quarter turn, the rod 13 is locked against withdrawal from the aperture 12 by horizontal stress. The rod 13 may be used to connect a pair of opposed plates 7 to form a duplex member. This allows a pair of panels 1 to be connected in parallel by sliding the lower halves of each duplex member into the upper recesses 6 of each panel 1 to form a freestanding structural unit. A horizontal course of these structural units may be laid by aligning the edges of the units using the tongue 2 and groove 3 guide means. A second course of these structural units may be fixed in place above the first by pressing the superposed structural unit upon the lower unit so that the protruding halves of the duplex members in the lower unit mate with the lower recesses 6 in the superposed unit. The second and subsequent courses may be staggered as in conventional bricklaying e.g. in the fashion of common stretching bond, to obtain additional horizontal strength. Usually courses laid to a height of 1.5 m provides the optimum height to enable conventional pouring of concrete. Additional courses can then be added after the first pouring of concrete has been completed. After the concrete has set the panels 1 can be removed easily with hammer and chisel.Example 2 In a second embodiment of the invention a concrete wall is constructed as described in Example 1 except that the panels 1 are not removed so that a thermally insulated concrete wall is formed. Finishing of the wall using conventional materials may then be carried out e.g. fixing plasterboard on the interior and painting of the exterior. Example 3 In a third embodiment of the invention the concrete wall is constructed as described in Example I except that the panels 1 are provided with a factory applied pre finished surface so that the panels 1 intended to face the exterior of the wall are coated with a weatherproof finish and those intended to face the interior are covered with aluminium foil. The panels 1 are not removed after the concrete has set in order to provide a completely insulated wall.Example 4 In a fourth embodiment of the invention the panels I are used to construct a double wall of parallel panels 1 defining a cavity between the walls as before but instead of filling with concrete it can be filled with mud, sand or gravel obtained from the surrounding area to provide a rapid assembly structure. This structure could be used in Third World countries where concrete is not readily available or alternatively at disaster areas to provide temporary accomodation. Twisted rope could be used to lock the opposing walls in an upright position and a sheet of single panels 1 could be used for a roof. This insulation system works equally well in hot climates to maintain a cool atmosphere inside the structure as in cold climates to maintain a satisfactory minimum temperature.Example 5 In a fifth embodiment of the invention a thermal insulating panel for insulating the walls of a building is moulded from polystyrene of a suitable bulk density. The panel 1 is of rectangular shape and each edge is provided with conventional tongue 2 and groove 3 guide means to facilitate edge to edge alignment of adjacent panels 1. Two opposing edges which will form the upper 4 and lower 5 edges of the panel 1 in use are provided with recesses 6 to accomodate vertical and horizontal tie means. In this embodiment the vertical tie means comprises an elongate plate 7 whose width tapers from the middle 8 towards an arcuate shaped tip 9 at either end. The plate 7 is formed by injection moulding of P.V.C, to provide a plate which has a thick narrow central portion 10 surrounded by thinner material strengthened by ribbing 11 extending outwards to the border of the plate. The central portion 10 is provided with apertures 12 through which horizontal ties may be driven to fix the plate to a wall. The horizontal tie in this embodiment consists of conventional masonary nails, screws or the like fastenings. Thus to fix an insulating panel 1 to a wall, firstly a P.V.C. plate 7 is slid into each recess 6 via T slots 16 in the edge 4 of the panel 1. The depth of each recess 6 is sufficient to accomodate about half of the plate 7 with the remainder protruding above the edge of the panel. The panel is then placed in position against the wall and masonary nails are driven through the apertures 12 in the protruding portion of the plate 7 into the wall. A second panel 1 may then be located above the first by sliding the lower edge recesses 6 over the protruding portion of the plates.7. In this manner a sheet of such panels may be built upon the walls of an existing building to provide a barrier to heat transfer.Example 6 A method of insulating a ceiling using panels and tie means according to this invention involves the use of panels similar to those described in Example 5 connected by horizontal tie means and fixed to the ceiling by vertical tie means. In this embodiment of the invention the horizontal tie means comprises an elongate plate 7 whose width tapers from the middle 8 towards an arcuate shaped tip 9 at either end. A suitable plate is described in Example 5. Vertical tie means for use in this method of insulating a ceiling comprises conventional masonary nails, screws or the like fastenings. Thus, to fix an insulating panel 1 to a ceiling, a P.V.C. plate 7 is slid into each recess 6 via T slots 16 in the edge 4 of the panel 1. Screws are driven through apertures 12 in the exposed portion of the plate and into the ceiling. A A second panel 1 may then be located adjacent the first by sliding edge recesses 6 of the second panel I over the exposed portions of plates 7 which have been fixed to the ceiling. In this way an extended sheet of insulation may be laid over the ceiling to provide a barrier to heat transfer. Where the ceiling is not a smooth surface ot, for example, where pipes are fixed to the ceiling it is possible to fix a suspended sheet of insulating panels to the ceiling using a duplex member as described in Example 1. The panels and ties have many other applications, for instance box sections can be formed from a structural unit by adding moulded end pieces and these sections may.be used to form concrete insulated floors and roofing. Many other modifications can be made to the structure by selecting different members to provide extra strength at corners for example.
