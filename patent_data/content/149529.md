# HERMETICALLY SEALED TWO COMPONENT MIXING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A mixing and dispensing receptacle including a first container 12 defining a first nozzle portion 14 and a first sealed chamber 13 retaining a first substance 22 and a rupturable wall portion 16 separating the first chamber from the interior of the first nozzle portion and a second container 25 defining a second chamber 26 retaining a second substance 27 and a second nozzle portion 28 disposed at least partially within the interior of the first nozzle portion and circumferentially sealed thereto so as to sealingly isolate the second substance. The second nozzle portion 28 is movable axially relative to the first nozzle portion 14 so as to pierce the rupturable wall portion 16 and provide communication between the first and second chambers 13, 26 . One of the nozzle portions comprises a tapered outer surface 17 adapted for engagement with a mating coupling member and an aseptic shield 35 covers the tapered outer surface and is removable therefrom. After penetration of the rupturable wall portion 16 by the second nozzle portion 28 , the first and second substances 22, 27 are transferred between the first and second chambers 13, 26 to provide mixing thereof. The tapered outer surface 17 is then enaged with a mating coupling member and the mixed substances discharged thereinto. Prior to its removal, the aseptic shield 35 protects the tapered nozzle surface 17 from any form of contamination.
