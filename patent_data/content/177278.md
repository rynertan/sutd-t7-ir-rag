# Emitter coupled logic circuit.

## Abstract
An improved ECL gate having faster output transition times without requiring additional current is provided. Two switching transistors 12,14 have their emitter terminals connected to a first current source 24,38 . A reference switching transistor 14 has its base connected to a refer ence voltage VRB and an input switching transistor 12 has its base connected to an input terminal 10 . An emitter follower transistor 16,18 is coupled to each switching transistor 12,14 . A second current source 48 is connected to each of the emitter follower transitors 16,18 by coupling circuitry which shunts current from one emitter follower 16,18 to the other thereby increasing the transition speed of the outputs 31,32 . In the preferred embodiment, the emitters of the current source transistors 20,22 for the two outputs 31,32 are coupled through a common resistance 48 to ground 34 . The collector of the inverting emitter coupled transistor 12 is coupled via a capacitor 50 to the base of the current source transistor 22 for the non inverting output 32 . The collector of the non inverting emitter coupled transistor 14 is coupled via a second capacitor 52 to the base of the current source transistor 20 for the inverting output 31 . The base of each such current source transistor 20,22 is coupled to a current source voltage Vcs via a resistance 54,56 or a diode. The capacitance coupling essentially causes only one of such current source transistors 20,22 to be turned on at any one time during switching. This forces all the current 21 through one or the other of the current source transistors 20,22 , thus allowing the output 31,32 which requires such current to change states faster.
