# Laser with stabilized external passive cavity.

## Abstract
A laser having a stabilized external passive cavity is dis closed, with stabilization being effected by modulation of an external mirror positioned along the laser axis. The laser sys tem includes first, second and third spaced mirrors with the second mirror being an output coupler positioned between the first and third mirrors so that an active cavity is defined between the first and second mirrors and a passive cavity is defined between the second and third mirrors. The active cavity feeds, or pumps, the passive cavity which is stabilized by modulation of the third mirror by movement along the laser axis by linear oscillation to Doppler shift the reflected waves within the passive cavity and thereby produce fre quencies that do not interfere with the stable modes of the active cavity. By stabilization of the passive cavity, advan tages of an intercavity laser device can be realized without incurring the practical disadvantages of such devices, and results in a laser device that is particularly well suited for particle size measurement.
