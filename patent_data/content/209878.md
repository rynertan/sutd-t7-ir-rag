# Filter with dielectric resonators.

## Abstract
A dielectric resonator filter 50 applicable to any desired frequency which is required with a microwave band or a millimeter wave band communication apparatus is disclosed. A single base plate 60 made of metal carries therewith a single or a plurality of dielectric resonators 52 , a pair of input output coupling members 62a, 62b , and a pair of input output connectors 64a, 64b all of which are arranged directly on the base plate 60 in a planar configuration. This base plate subassembly 69 is shielded by a cover 56 having a recess in a sectional view which serves as a cutoff range waveguide.
