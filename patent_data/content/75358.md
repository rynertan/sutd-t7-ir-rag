## Abstract
A method for sucking up ground or sludge by means of a suction dredge provided with a suction pipe having a drag head. Through the suction pipe 1 water and ground or sludge are sucked up. The ground or the sludge is loosened in front of the inlet opening of the drag head. Said loosening operation takes place at such a distance from the inlet opening 4 of the drag head 3 that by the loosening operation the gases being liberated remain substantially out of the suction action of the drag head 3 . The loosening being performed by injection nozzles 28 and or cutting blades mounted in a frame 10 swingable mounted about a horizontal axis 9 to the suction tube 1 .
