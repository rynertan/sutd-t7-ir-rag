# Process for producing 2,6 naphthalenedicarboxylic acid.

## Abstract
A process for producing 2,6 naphthalenedicarboxylic acid which comprises oxidizing 2,6 diisopropylnaphthalene or its oxidation derivative with molecular oxygen in a reaction medium containing at least 70 by weight of an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid selected from acetic acid, propionic acid and a mixture of these in the presence of an oxidation catalyst comprising A at least one heavy metal element selected from cobalt and manganese and B a bromine element characterized in that said oxidation is carried out in the presence of 1.1 to 15 gram atoms, per gram atom of the bromine element, of an alkali metal.
