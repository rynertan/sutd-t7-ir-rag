# Tractor front loader.

## Abstract
Tractor front loaders of drive in type have brackets such as 10 and 16 fixed to a tractor and engageable with a detachable sub frame such as 18 carrying a boom assem bly such as 21 mounting a bucket such as 29 . The sub frame is secured to the brackets by close fitting pins causing removal difficulties, or loose fitting pins causing loader instability and accelerated pin wear. Easy release pins 43 are therefore provided, each passing with substantial radial clearance 44 through aligned axially spaced holes 45 in one bracket 16 and fitting, between the holes 45 , in an eccentric bush 47 which fits in a boss 48 fixed to the sub frame 18 and is rotateable by a handle 49 into an operative position in which the pin 43 establishes contact with one side of the holes 45 and the boss 48 establishes clamping contact with a cam plate 54 fixed to the bracket 16 , or into an easy release position in which the contacts are disestablished.
