# Improvements relating to cold sheet metal roll forming apparatus.

## Abstract
A cold sheet metal forming apparatus has pairs of upper and lower forming rolls 2, 3 through which the sheet metal is passed in succession. The forming rolls have end bearings 11 mounted in respective upper and lower bearing housings 12 mounted on a common frame 7 . The two housings are secured to the frame by a pair of screw threaded rods 13 extending through vertically aligned apertures in the housings, the lower ends of the rods extending into the frame and receiving nuts 14 for holding the rods in the frame and further nuts 14 being screwed on to the rods to hold the lower housing on the frame and the upper housing in place on the rods. Such an arrangement leaves additional room between adjacent pairs of rolls and a second set of rollers are nested between the first set also with the simplified support arrangement at each end of each roll so as to allow a second rolling line to be kept in position and available for prompt use without as has hitherto been the case the necessity to change rollers.
