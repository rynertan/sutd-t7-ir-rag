# A multiplex design container having a three layered wall structure and a process for producing the same.

## Abstract
The container comprises a metallic vessel a as an outer layer, a concrete lining b as an inner layer that is formed on the inner surface of the metallic vessel and which is reinforced with a reinforcing material and strengthened with an impregnant, and a polymerized and cured impreg nant layer as an intermediate layer that is formed between the metallic vessel a and the concrete lining b . A mix comprising cement, water, aggregate, and a reinforcing material is placed in a space between the vessel a and a mold not shown . After curing, the mold is removed and the lining b dried with heat. The container is closed by a cover 4 carrying a core 3 and the interior of the container is evacuated by a pressure reducing unit 7. An impregnant is injected through a supply pipe 8 and the pressure is in creased, causing impregnation of voids in the concrete lin ing b and the space between the vessel a and the lining b . Excess impregnant is drawn off through a suction pipe 9 and the remaining impregnant is the polymerized and cured.
