## Description
Derivatives of Arginine Vasopressin Antagonists This is a continuation in part of Manning et al.,Application Serial No. 06 574,257, filed January 26th 1984. This invention relates to novel peptides which antagonize the antidiuretic and or vasopressor action of arginine vasopressin in vivo. Attempts to develop clinically useful synthetic antagonists of in vivo antidiuretic and or vasopressor responses to arginine vasopressin, the antidiuretic hormone ADH , have led to the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of hundreds of analogues of the neurohypophysial peptides. oxytocin and vasopressin. Analogues of vassopressin or oxytocin which antagonize antidiuretic responses to ADH have been reported by Chan et al, Science. vol. 161 1968 at 280 and J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., vol. 174 1970 at 541 and vol. 196 1976 at 746 Dousa et al., Science. vol. 167 1970 at 1134 Nestor et al., J. Med. Chem.. vol. 18 1975 at 1022 and Larsson et al., J. Med. Chem.. vol.21 1978 at 352. None of the compounds reported has been pharmacologically or clinically useful as an antidiuretic antagonist. The synthesis and evaluation of vasopressin analogues, incorporating etherified tyrosine at the 2 position, valine at the 4 position and D orL arginine at the 8 position, which antagonize the antidiuretic action of ADH in vivo, have been reported by Sawyer et al., Science, vol. 212 1981 at 49 Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 24 1981 at 701 and Manning et al., U.S. Patents 4,367,225 and 4,399,125. The effect of variation in the amino acid at the 4 position of arginine vasopressin has been investigated by Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 26 1983 at 1607 and in U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 06 541,979 filed October 14, 1983. Design of tissue specific agonists and antagonists in the field of neurohypophysial peptides has been considered by Sawyer et al., Molecular and Cellular Endocrinoloqv, vol. 22 1981 , 117 134 Manning et al., The Pituitary, Beardwell et al., eds., Butterworths,Kent, England 1981 , 265 296 Manning et al., Peptides, Synthesis, Structure, Function, Rich et al., eds., Pierce Chemical Co., 1981 at 257 260 and Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 25 1982 at 45 and 414. Modification of oxytocin, containing a D amino acid at the 2 position has been disclosed by Lebl et al., PePtides, Walter de Gruyter Co., Berlin 1983 , at 457. Other modifications, having a penicillamine unit at the 1 and 6 positions of vasopressin, have been disclosed by Simek et al., ibid, at 461. Modification of vasopressin analogues at the 9 position, for example, 1 deamino 9 D alananimidej AVP1 has been investigated byGazis et al., ibid., at 465. In the latter article, retention of significant antidiuretic activity of vasopressins, having 9 D or L alanamide groups is recited, but the compounds have markedly decreased pressor activity. See also Buku et al., Int. J. PePtide Protein Res., vol. 23 1984 , at 551. Brtnik et al., Coll. Czech. Chem. Comm., vol. 48 1983 at 2862 disclose modification of vasopressin by removal of glycine at the 9 position and replacement ofD Arg at the 8 position by basic non coded amino acids.These compounds have almost no uterotonic, pressor or antidiuretic activity. Toth et al., Acta Physics etChimica, vol. 29 1983 at 187, report the synthesis of three analogues of deamino vasopressin, lacking theC terminal glycinamide group. Cort et al. have proposed, in U.S. Patent 4,285,858, that vasopressing analogues having a configuration at the 8 and 9 positions of L Arg D AlaNH2 or D Arg L AlaNH2 have very weak antidiuretic or pressor activity. Huffman et al. U.S. Patent 4,469,679 recite the preparation of octapeptide vasopressin antagonists. However, Manning et al., Nature, vol. 308 1984 at 652, have found that the carboxy terminus of vasopressin is required for activity, but not for binding. It is therefore apparent that the correlation between structure of neurohypophysial peptides and action in vivo is not well understood and there is a continuing need for the development of pharmacologically and clinically effective antagonists of the antidiuretic action of arginine vasopressin. It is an object of the invention to provide novel antagonists of the antidiuretic and or vasopressor action of ADH, which are effective in vivo. According to the invention there are provided antagonists of the antidiuretic and or vasopressor action of ADH, which are compounds of the formula EMI4.1 wherein n is 4 or 5 X is D or L Tyr R in which R is C1 C4 alkyl , D Phe, D Val, D Leu, D Ile,D Nva, D Nle, D Cha, D Abu, D Thr, D Asn, D Gln orD Met Y is Val, Ile, Thr, Ala, Lys, Cha, Nva, Met, Nle,Orn, Ser, Asn, Gln, Phe, Tyr, Gly, Abu or Leu Z is Dor L Arg, Orn or Lys and Q us Orn NH2 ,NHCH2CH2NH2, Val NH2 2 , Phe NH2 , Ile NH2 .Thr NH2 , Pro NH2 or Tyr NH2 , provided that whenY is Val or Gln, R is also H. This invention further relates to a method for antagonizing the in vivo antidiuretic and or vasopressor response to ADH, comprising administering to an animal being treated an amount of a compound of Formula I, in admixture with a physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, effective to antagonize the antidiuretic and or vasopressor response to ADH. Compounds of the invention, or comparison compounds of the prior art, are derivatives of arginine vasopressin. Amino acids are in the L form, unless otherwise indicated. Each symbol, except for that of the 9 terminal substituent, is for the acyl C O residue of the designated amino acid. For example, 9 OH represents a compound with a completed COOH group of the amino acid residue at the 8 position and is, therefore, a desglycinamide compound.The correlation between full names and

The active peptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis, as described by Bankowski et al. 1978 , infra Merrifield. J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 85 1963 at 2149 and Biochemistry, vol. 3 1964 at 1385 Manning,J. Am. Chem. Soc. vol. 90 1968 at 1348 Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 19 1976 at 376 Lowbridge et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 20 1977 at 1173 Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 16 1973 at 975 Kruszynski et al. 1980 , infra Sawyer et al., 1981 , suPra orManning et al. 1981 , supra. Compounds of the 9 desglycine group, that is, Q isNH2, are prepared as for other arginine vasopressin derivatives, except that one less cycle of deprotection, neutralization and coupling is employed. That is, the first amino acid residue, attached to resin1 will be Dor L Arg, rather than Gly, as would be the case for compounds in which Q is to be GlyNH2. Compounds in which the amino acid at the 9 position is other than Gly NH2 are prepared in a similar fashion, but by attaching an amino acid other than glycine to the resin at the start of the synthesis. Desglycinamide compounds, that is Q is OH, in accordance with this invention are prepared as described in the Examples. The discovery of the antidiuretic antagonists d CH2 5Tyr alk VAVP, Sawyer et al. 1981 , suPra and Manning et al. 1981 , supra, led to the synthesis of various analogues having a cyclopentamethylene ring structure and various substituents at the 2 position.Other modifications at the 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 positions, have been proposed. It will also be understood that, when alkyl substituents R can be linear or branched, contemplated equivalents include all possible isomers. Compounds of this invention, having an action antagonistic toward the antidiuretic action of arginine vasopressin are generally those wherein the 2 substituent is an amino acid of the D series and the 4 substituent is an aliphatic amino acid. When the 4 substituent is Gln and the 2 substituent is of the L series, it has been found that the compounds generally have specific antivasopressor action. Most of compounds of Formula I are accordingly very effective antagonists of the antidiuretic response toADH. They can therefore be used in pharmacological studies on the contribution of ADH to a variety of pathological states involving water retention. It is further contemplated that they could be effective and specific agents for treating the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH, that is, theSchwartz Bartter syndrome or SIADH. This syndrome can complicate a number of disorders, including carcinomas, pulmonary diseases, intracranial diseases and head injuries, Bartter et. al., Am. J. Med., vol. 42 1967 at 790. In addition, compounds of Formula I are effective as antagonists of the vasopressor response toADH. Compounds of Formula I, where X is Tyr and Y is Gln or X is Tyr R , Y is Gln and R us H, methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, can be used in a similar fashion for conditions in which antivasopressor activity is indicated. Surprisingly, activity of the compounds of the invention as antagonists of ADH or vasopressin is not lost by removal or modification of the 9 substituent.It is known that the chemical bond between the 8 and 9 positions is at least one point at which digestive enzymes, such as trypsin, attack vasopressin type hormones. Therefore, compounds of this invention, if not themselves entirely stable toward disgestive enzymes, will be useful in suggesting routes to peptide derivatives which will retain their activity when administered orally. A representative compound, whereinQ is NHCH2CH2NH2, has been found orally active when administered to rats. Retention of activity following hydrolysis of theC terminal glycinamide of arginine vasopressin compounds, in accordance with this invention, is highly unexpected, in view of tryptic digestion of AVP to give desglycinamide9 AVP, which had neither the antidiuretic nor the vasopressor activity, characteristic of AVP. See, du Vigneaud et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc., vol 75 1953 at 4880. The compounds of this invention can be employed in mixtures with conventional excipients, i.e., physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carriers suitable for parenteral or other application, provided that the carriers do not interact deleteriously with the active compounds. Accordingly the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound ofFormula I in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatine, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides. pentaerythritol fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, etc. The phatmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing the osmotic pressure, buffers, colouring, flavouring andor aromatic substances, which do not deleteriously interact with the active compounds. For parenteral or intranasal application, solutions, preferably aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions or implants, including suppositories, are particularly suitable. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages. For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees, or capsules, having talc and or a carbohydrate carrier or binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and or corn starch and or potato starch. A syrup, elixir or the like can be used, wherein a sweetened vechicle is employed. Sustained release compositions can be formulated, including those wherein the active compound is protected with differentially degradable coatings, e.g., by microencapsulation, multiple coatings, etc. The compounds of Formula I are generally administered to animals, including but not limited to mammals, e.g. livestock, household pets, humans, cattle, cats and dogs. A diuretically effective daily dosage of the active compounds can be administered parenterally in a single dosage or as divided dosages throughout the day. Parenteral or intranasal administration is preferred. The compounds of this invention are particularly valuable in the treatment of humans afflicted with water retention of any etiology. In this regard, they can be administered in substantially the same manner as the known compounds oxytocin and vasopressin. to achieve their physiological effects. It will be appreciated that the actual preferred amounts of active compounds used will vary according to the specific compound being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, and the particular organisms being treated. Optimal application rates under in a given set of conditions can be ascertained by those skilled in the art of using conventional dosage determination tests in view of the above guidelines.
