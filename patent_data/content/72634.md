# Extensometers.

## Abstract
An electrical capacitance extensometer comprising capacitance surfaces formed on metal sheathed mineral insulated cables and an earthed capacitance modulating member adapted to be displaced relative to the capacitance surfaces in response to strain in a workpiece. The extenso meter is encapsulated in a stainless steel envelope to adapt it for use submerged in liquid metal.
