## Description
PLASTICS FILM LAMINATE This invention relates to a flexible plastics film laminate which is especially, but not exclusively, useful for packaging materials, particularly materials which are sensitive to oxygen and or water vapour. It is well known to package materials in plastics films or plastics film laminates. Where the materials are sensitive to oxygen and or water vapour e.g.materials such as certain foodstuffs, beverages, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, seeds, electrical components etc , a plastics packaging material is chosen which will provide a barrier against ingress of oxygen and or water vapour. It is also well known to package certain foodstuffs in an atmosphere of gas contained within a plastics material chosen for its low permeability to that gas controlled atmosphere packaging . One such plastics film which has the property of low permeability to oxygen, other gases and water vapour, is metallised poly ethylene glycol terephthalate hereafter PET , a single web of which may typically 2 provide an oxygen barrier of about icc metre day.By laminating metallised PET to a further web of metallised film, either another ply of metallised PET or another metallised thermoplastic polymer film, further reductions in permeability can be achieved. U.KS patent application no. 2103999A describes such a packaging material comprising a laminate of two layers of metallised thermoplastic polymer film, at least one of which is metallised PET. Whilst the use of metallised PET is highly advantageous in packaging moisture and or oxygen sensitive materials, because of its excellent barrier properties, it also has some disadvantages, for example a It is not readily heat sealable. In order, therefore, to make a heat sealable packaging material based on metallised PET, at least one external layer of a heat sealable material, for example a polyolefine such as polyethylene, must be provided. Furthermore, the presence of only a heat sealable external layer is not always entirely satisfactory since it only permits the making of fin seals. If overlap seals are required, a second ply of heat sealable material must be provided on the opposite side of the PET from the first such layer . The provision of these extra heat sealable layers increases costs. b PET is expensive relative to certain other thermo plastic films, for example certain polyolefine films like polyethylene or polypropylene. c PET has only moderate resistance to flex cracking, so laminates based on metallised PET used for packaging, for example, low viscosity liquids, can rupture due to flexural stresses when such packages are transported over long distances or over rough terrain. Netallised polyolefine films and their laminates are also used in packaging and generally have lower costs and better flex crack resistance than metallised PET and metallised PET laminates. Many polyolefine films are also heat sealable in their own right so the addition of a further heat sealing ply can often be omitted. However, in comparison with metallised PET, they have poor gas barrier properties, 2 typically an oxygen permeability of 30cc metre2 24 hours, which is not greatly improved on lamination. U.K. patent specification no. 1566925 describes in its Examples laminates of metallised polypropylene film with various unmetallised polyolefine films, such laminates having oxygen permeabili 2 ties in the range 20 50 cc metre 24 hours.These laminates are thus generally unsuitable for packaging oxygen sensitive materials or for other applications requiring gas barrier. We have now found that, in contrast to prior teachings, it is not necessary to use a metallised film which itself has good gas barrier properties, such as metallised PET, in order to make a film laminate suitable for barrier packaging. Rather, we have found that by laminating certain metallised polyolefine films which films do not themselves have good gas barrier properties to either themselves or other metallised films such as another metallised polyolefine film, a metallised regenerated cellulose film or a metallised polyamide nylon film, it is possible to produce laminates with good gas and moisture barrier properties similar to or better than conventional packaging laminates of metallised PET unmetallised polyolefine.Furthermore, as will be appreciated, the other inherent properties of polyolefine films, such as low cost, good flex crack resistance and heat sealability can be built into the laminate by a suitable choice of polyolefine film, metallisation and laminate structure. The improvement in oxygen and moisture barrier achievable by laminating two metallised films in accordance with the present invention is considerably higher than might be anticipated from known technology. Thus it is normally anticipated that when two non metallised films, each with gas permeability X, are laminated together, the gas permeability of the laminate is approximately 0.5X. In contrast, when two metallised films are laminated, in accordance with the present invention, improvements in barrier of typically 10 to 100 fold are achieved. It is this improvement in barrier which essentially distinguishes the laminates of this invention from previously described laminates such as those described in U.K. 1566925. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a flexible plastics film laminate which comprises a thermoplastic polyolefine film A, metallised on one or both faces, preferably with aluminium, joined together by a layer of adhesive with another thermoplastic film B, also metallised on one or both faces. Film B may also be a polyolefine, or a cellulosic or polyamide film. The invention also provides a process for packaging a material, in which process a film laminate as defined is used. In the laminates of the invention, each film can be metallised on one or both of its surfaces, and the films can be laminated with two metallised surfaces face to face preferred , or two non metallised surfaces face to face, or a metallised surface facing a non metallised surface. If each film is metallised on one surface and the two films are adhered together with the metal layers face to face, the metallised faces are inherently protected from damage via scratching, scuffing etc. If both film A and film B are heat sealable polyolefines, the laminate can be heat sealed either A A or B B or A B. If structures are used in which a metallised face is exposed, this may be protected against damage by applying an additional coating or ink over the metal. The nature of the adhesive is not critical. Various curing and non curing packaging grade adhesives, or hot melt resin adhesives or extrusion lamination with a polyolefine or similar thermoplastic resin can be used. We prefer to use a moisture resistant, one or two component polyurethane curing adhesive. The polyolefine film A can include the polyethylenes, including low, medium and high density, linear and branched chain polyethylenes or their copolymers, or polypropylenes, including polypropylene homopolymer or copolymer films, coextruded polypropylene films including films with a poly propylene core and a coextruded surface of another polyolefine and polypropylene films with a surface coating such as acrylic or PVdC. The polyolefine can be heatsealable or non heat sealable, cast or oriented. In general, any polyolefine can be used in the invention provided that it can be suitably metallised, i.e. provided it has a surface capable of adequate adhesion to the metal. Film B can include any of the polyolefine films described above, or polyamide cast or oriented , or regenerated cellulose. As will be understood, the films chosen for the laminate may depend on the use to which the laminate is to be put, for example having regard to the mechanical, barrier, constructional, hygiene and cost requirements of the package. Commercially available polyolefine films preferably used to make the laminates of the invention will normally be from about 6 to 400 micron thick, preferably 8 to 100 micron thick. Such laminates will thus normally have a thickness of about 12 to 800 micron, preferably about 16 to 200 micron, plus the thickness of the metal layers e.g.0.02 to 0.06 micron and the thickness of the adhesive not normally above about 10 micron . It will be appreciated that the thickness and construction of a laminate of the invention will be chosen having regard to its intended use and cost, the thicker laminates usually having greater mechanical strength, resistance to wear, better seal integrity in the case of heat sealable laminates and higher cost, whilst the thinner laminates are less costly and more flexible for packaging purposes. Heat sealable packages can be made from heatsealable laminates of the invention in a conventional manner. Whilst the laminates of the invention are particularly useful for barrier packaging, they also have other uses. For example, because of their low light transmission and the extremely low probability that scratches in one of the metal layers will be coincident with scratches in the other metal layer, they can advantageously be used for the packaging of light sensitive materials such as photographic or X ray films or photographic or other light sensitive chemicals. Laminates of the invention can also advantageously be used for the construction of insulating elements for buildings, for example for surfacing or encapsulating fibre glass or foamed panels for prefabricated walls, ceilings or floors. Such elements are normally surfaced with good moisture barrier films such as metallised PET film, which serve to prevent uptake of moisture by the panel material which would increase its heat conductivity and consequently conductive heat loss through the element. In addition to performing this function, the laminates of the invention also serve to reduce radiant heat losses from the surface of the elements, metallised polyolefine films having much lower infra red emissivity than metallised PET films. It is an important feature of the present invention that the two films which are adhered together to form a laminate of the invention are both metallised. The same barrier effect is not achieved if only one of the films is metallised even if it is metallised on both surfaces and or to a thickness the same as or greater than twice the normal thickness. The laminates of the invention will have an 2 oxygen permeability of less than 5 cc m2 24 hours, preferably less than 1 cc m2 24 hours. In order that the invention may be more fully understood, the following Examples are given by way of illustration only.EXAMPLE 1 A 40 micron commercially available corona treated medium density polyethylene film was metallised with aluminium on the treated surface by vaporisation in vacuo, in accordance with knon techniques, so as to deposit 400A 0.04 micron of aluminium. After metallisation, oxygen permeability of this film was in excess of 50 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere, making the film unsuitable for packaging of oxygen sensitive products. The metallised surface of this film was coated with a layer of a commercially available two component polyurethane adhesive and dried to give a coat weight of 2 2.8 grams metre2. This adhesive coated surface was then calendered to the metallised surface of a further sample of the same metallised 40 micron medium density polyethylene film. After leaving for 1 week to allow the adhesive to cure, 2 an oxygen permeability of 0.2 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere was measured on the laminate at 23 0C and 0 relative humidity, making the laminate suitable for packaging many oxygen sensitive products.Moisture vapour transmission rate of the sample was 0.26 gram metre2 24 hours at 380C, 90 relative 2 0 humidity, and less than 0.1 gram metre 24 hours at 23 C, 50 relatie humidity. The sample was flexed 100 times on a Gelbo flexing machine. Moisture vapour transmission rate of the flexed sample was 0.29 grar metre2 24 hours at 380C, 90 relative humidity,i.e. not sinificantly higher than the unflexed material. Packs were produced from this laminate on commercial packaging machinery with both fin and overlap seals. A control sample in which the metallised and adhesive coated 40 micron polyethylene film was laminated to unmetallised polyethylene film had an oxygen permeability 2 of greater than 25 cc metre 24 hours atmosphere. EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 was repeated laminating the the same metal ised 40 micron polyolefine film to a 24 micron metallised PVDC coated regenerated cellulose film commercially available as 365 Cello M1 from British Cellophane Ltd. This latter film had an oxygen 2 permeability of 4 cc metre 24 hours atmosphere at 23 0C and 0 relative humidity and a moisture vapour transmission 2 0 rate of 5 grams metre2 24 hours at 38 C and 90 relative humidity.The resultant laminate had an oxygen 2 0 permeability of 0.8 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere at 23 C and 0 relative humidity and a moisture vapour transmission 2 rate of 1.2 gram metre2 24 hours at 380C and 90 relative humidity.EXAMPLE 3 A 15 micron commercially available corona treated oriented nylon 6 polyamide film was metallised with 0 aluminium on the treated surface so as to deposit 500A 0.05 micron of aluminium. The metallised surface of this film was coated with a layer of a commercially available two component polyurethane adhesive and dried to give a coat weight of 2.7 grams metre2. This adhesive coated surface was then calendered to the metallised surface of the metallised 40 micron medium density polyethylene film described in Example 1 above. After curing the laminate had an oxygen permeability 2 of 0.1 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere at 230C and 0 relative humidity, and a moisture vapour transmission rate 2 of less than 0.1 gram metre2 24 hours at 23 C and 50 relative humidity. EXAMPLE 4 An 8 micron oriented polypropylene coextruded film which is commercially available was metallised with aluminium so as to deposit 500A 0.05 micron of aluminium.After metallisation, oxygen permeability of this film was 2 in excess of 50 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere. The metallised surface of this film was laminated to metallised 40 micron medium density polyethylene as described in Example 1. After 2 curing, an oxygen permeability of 2.2 cc metre2 24 hours atmos 0 phere at 23 C and 0 relative humidity and a moisture vapour 2 transmission rate of less than 0.1 gram metre 24 hours at 230C and 50 relative humidity were measured on the laminate. Infra red emissivity of the unmetallised surface of the 8 micron polypropylene film was 0.11. A control sample in which the 8 micron metallised polypropylene was replaced by 12 micron metallised PET has an emissivity of 0.57.EXAMPLE 5 An 8 micron oriented polypropylene coextruded film which is commercially available was metallised on 0 both surfaces so as to deposit a total of 400A 0.04 micron of aluminium, approximately 200A on each side. After metallisation, oxygen permeability of this film was in 2 excess of 50 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere. One surface of the film was laminated to metallised 40 micron medium density polyethylene as described in Example 1 above, and 2 the other surface was over lacquered with 1. 0 gram metre2 of a commercially available nitrocellulose lacquer.After 2 curing, an oxygen permeability of 4.1 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere at 23 0C and 0 relative humidity, and a moisture 2 vapour transmission rate of less than 0.1 gram metre2 24 hours at 230C and 50 relative humidity were measured on the laminate.EXAMPLE 6 A 15 micron commercially available high density polyethylene film, corona treated on both sides, was metallised with aluminium on both sides so as to deposit o a total of 400A 0.04 micron aluminium, approximately 0 200A on each side. After metallisation, oxygen permeability 2 of this film was in excess of 50 cc metre2 24 hours atmosphere.This film was laminated to metallised 40 micron medium density polyethylene as described in Example 1 above, and the exposed metallised surface was overlacquered with 1.0 gram metre2 of a commercially available nitro cellulose lacquer. 2After curing, an oxygen permeability of 3.7 cc metre 24 hours atmosphere at 230C and 0 relative humidity, and a moisture vapour transmission rate of less than 0.1 gram metre2 24 hours at 230 C and 50 relative humidity were measured on the laminate.EXAMPLE 7 Example 3 was repeated laminating the metallised polyamide film to a 75 micron commercially available corona treated low density polyethylene film metallised with aluminium on the treated side so as to deposit o 400A 0.04 micron of aluminium. After curing, the laminate 2 had an oxygen permeability of 0.2 cc metre2 24 hour 0 atmosphere at 23 C relative humidity, and a moisture vapour 2 transmission rate of less than 0.2 gram metre2 24 hours at 23 0C and 50 relative humidity. EXAMPLE 8 Example 7 was repeated laminating the metallised polyamide film to a 75 micron commercially available corona treated linear low density polyethylene film metallised with aluminium on the treated side so as to deposit 400A 0.04 micron of aluminium. After curing, the laminate had 2 an oxygen permeability of 0.2 cc metre 24 hours atmosphere 0 at 23 C and 0 relative humidity and a moisture vapour 2 transmission rate of less than 0.2 gram metre 24 hours at 230C and 50 relative humidity.
