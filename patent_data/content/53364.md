# Apparatus for measuring concentration of radioactivity.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring the concentration of radioactivity in a radioactive fluid discharged from a nuclear power plant. The apparatus comprises a radio activity concentration measurement pipe 6 arranged to extend vertically, fluid supplying means 5 for sup plying the fluid into the measurement pipe in such a manner that the fluid flows down through the measure ment pipe along the axis of the measurement pipe with out contacting the inner surface of the latter, radio activity concentration measuring means 11, 12, 13 dis posed at the outside of the measurement pipe for meas uring the radioactivity concentration in the fluid flowing in the measurement pipe, and means for discharging the radioactive fluid to the outside of the measurement pipe. The apparatus further comprises a gas supply pipe 20 opening at its one end to the atmosphere and com municated at its other end with the inside of the meas urement pipe, and a check valve 21 disposed in the gas supply pipe and operated at a pressure higher than the atmospheric pressure. When the pressure in the measurement pipe has come down below the atmospheric pressure, the check valve is operative to always main tain the internal pressure in the measurement pipe at the atmospheric pressure, thereby to prevent the fluid level in the measurement pipe from being raised to reduce the background noise during the measurement of the radioactivity concentration.
