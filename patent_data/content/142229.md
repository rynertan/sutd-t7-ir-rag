# Production of reaction bonded silicon carbide artefacts.

## Abstract
The production of a reaction bonded silicon carbide artefact by siliconising a green body comprising a coherent mixture of carbon and silicon carbide particles includes the step of forming a layer of carbon of open cellular structure on the green body by carbonisation of a sleeve or tube on the green body of carbonaceous material in contact with the body. This material may be impregnated with particulate sili con suspended in water or a paste. The material may be a quilted or woven fabric of fibrous material or it may be in the form of paper. The material is in a flexible strip or sheet form to enable it to be wrapped around the green body or a former about which the green body is to be formed.
