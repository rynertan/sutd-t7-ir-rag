# Convertible hospital bed.

## Abstract
The invention involves a bed which is convertible into an easy chair. Conversion occurs by moving an upper frame 20 and the mattress 40 longitudinally toward the foot 34 of the bed while elevating the upper body portion 22 of the movable frame to form the back of the chair. As the frame moves toward the foot 34 , the lower portion 24 , together with the portion of the mattress 40 thereon, is drawn back underneath the bed and out of the way from interfering with the patient sitting in the chair configuration with his feet on the floor. The chair configuration may be elevated so that the patient is assisted in rising to a standing position without dependence upon attendant personnel. The bed includes an inflatable pillow 192 which further assists the patient in rising unaided. Other features of the bed include spinal massage apparatus 110 mounted in the main frame 16 of the bed, independent elevating apparatus 70,80 for selectively elevating the foot of the bed, relative to the head in order to slant the bed or alternately elevating and lowering the head and foot of the bed to develop a rocking motion, and a motorized blower 182 for directing air to a porous coverlet 170 to supply heat or cooling to the patient without resort to electrical wiring, as in an electric blanket, or to multiple covers for warmth. All of the various apparatus providing these features of the bed are power driven and are controlled from a remote console which is accessible to the patient.
