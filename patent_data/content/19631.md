# TRANSMISSION MEANS FOR HYBRID TYPE FLYWHEEL VEHICLES.

## Abstract
Disclosed is transmission means for hybrid tape flywheel vehicles. A flywheel is rotated by an internal combustion engine through a driving shaft. When the rotational frequency of the flywheel reaches a predertermined level, the internal combustion engine is kept in an idling state while the flywheel rotates the propeller shaft. The internal combustion engine is ignited again by the detection of the fact that the rotational frequency of the flywheel reduces, to thereby raise the rotational frequency of the flywheel. The power transmission between the driving shaft and the flywheel is controlled through a clutch mechanism which is engaged or disengaged in accordance with the change of the rotational frequency of the internal combustion engine.
