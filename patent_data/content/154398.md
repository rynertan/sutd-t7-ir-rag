# Brake actuator.

## Abstract
A vehicle brake actuator has actuator components in the form of a cylinder body 1 and a piston 3 operatively associated respectively with a non rotatable adjuster shaft 9 and a rotatable nut member 10 threadedly interengaged by way of a reversible screw thread connection 11 , the nut member 10 being arranged to follow brake applying move ment of the component 3 being movable axially along the shaft 9 by rotating therealong when adjustment is required and being otherwise prevented from rotation by clutch means. The piston includes an auxiliary piston part 30 axially and rotationally movable relative thereto and aranged to be manually operable from the exterior of the actuator. The piston part 30 is provided with axial projec tions 35 , which upon axially inward movement of said piston part, may be brought into engagement with recesses 36 in the nut member 10 , whereby the nut member may be wound along the shaft 9 to de adjust the adjuster without the necessity to rotate the piston 3 . Pressure applied to the auxiliary piston part 30 overcomes the force of a spring 17 , upon the occurrence of excessive braking loads to prevent actuation of the adjuster which is thereby rendered load insensitive.
