# An improved end closure member for a container.

## Abstract
A closure in the form of a wedge shaped member 3 to close the end of a container, such as a transport flask. The wedge shaped member 3 carries a seal plate 7 which is urged by spring means 9 to project beyond the smaller end of the wedge shaped member when the latter is in a position to open the end of the container. On advancing the wedge shaped member 3 to close the end of the container the projecting end of the plate 7 first abuts against a stop 18 and continued advance of the wedge shaped member relative to the seal plate 7 causes displacement of the seal plate towards the interior of the container to effect a seal at the end of the container.
