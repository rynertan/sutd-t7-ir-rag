# Shield termination enclosure with access means and shield connection device.

## Abstract
A shield connection device 10 for connecting EMI shielded cable shield to an EMI enclosure, includes an electrically conductive body 12 defining a shield termina tion enclosure, the body having a plurality of passageways 14 extending through the body, the passageways substan tially parallel to longitudinal axis of the body and the body 12 having means 20 for obtaining access to the passage way. The connection device may include means 22 adjacent to the access means for applying fixable electrically conduc tive material 26 to the passageway 14 through the access means 20 for electrically connecting EMI cable shield thereto. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the means 22 for applying fixable electrically conductive mate rial in the form of solder comprises a heat recoverable sleeve 24 with a preform of solder 26 on its interior. Sufficient material is provided for filling the opening with electrically conductive material to block EMI paths through the passage way 14 .
