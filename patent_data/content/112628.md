# Method of producing rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams using polyethylene terephthalate waste streams as polyol extenders.

## Abstract
A polyethylene terephthalate waste stream comprising polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, monoethylene glycol and polyethylene glycols can be employed as a polyol ex tender in the production of rigid polyurethane and polyiso cyanurate foams. The properties of such foams are compar able with those made without an extender or with the use of the more expensive commercially available extender.
