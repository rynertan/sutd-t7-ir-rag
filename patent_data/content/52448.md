# Photosensitive drum for electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A photosensitive drum for an electrostatic copying apparatus, which is constituted by holding a cylindrical drum having a photosensitive member provided around its outer periphery, between a pair of flanges in axial direction from opposite ends of the drum, characterized in that each of the flanges 12 , 13 is formed having a diameter larger than the external diameter of the drum 11 , and at the edge of the flange 12 , 13 has a cylindrical portion extending along the axis of the drum 11 to face to the opposite flange, the edge of the drum 11 closely fits into the cylindrical portion 14 , 15 . According to the present invention, since the edges of the drum 11 closely fits into the cylindrical portion 14 , 15 of the flanges 12 , 13 , it is not required to improve the dimensional accuracy of the inside periphery of the opposite ends of the drum 11 , while it is essential to improve the dimensional accuracy in a conventional manner.
