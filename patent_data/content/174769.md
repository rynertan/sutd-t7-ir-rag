A solution of 2 2,4 difluorophenyl 2,3 epoxy 1 3 4 trifluoromethoxystyryl 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl propane 3.13 g in dimethylformamide was treated with triazole 0.85 g and heated on a steam bath for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate, and the extracts were combined, washed with water dried over sodium sulphate and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica, eluting with ethyl acetate methanol, 95 5 by volume, and the oil crystallised from ethyl acetate hexane to give 1 2,4 difluorophenyl 2 2 3 4 trifluoromethoxystyryl 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 1 1,2,4 triazol 1 ylmethyl ethanol, m.p. 151 153 , identical with the product obtained in Example 1. The epoxy propane starting material used in the above process, was obtained as follows Sodium hydride 0.38 g of a 55 dispersion in oil was washed oil free with petroleum ether, b.p. 60 80 and suspended in dry dimethylformamide 25 ml under an atmosphere of argon. Trimethyl oxosulphonium iodide 2.19 g was added, and after the evolution of hydrogen had ceased, the mixture was stirred for 0.5 hour, then a solution of the above described acetophenone 2.6 g in dry dimethylformamide 12 ml was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 55 for 1.25 hours, then poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were washed with water, dried and evaporated to dryness to give the required epoxy propane starting material as a light brown oil, which was used without further purification. A mixture of 1 2,4 difluorophenyl 2 3 formyl 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 1 1,2,4 triazol 1 ylmethyl ethanol 0.6 g , p methoxybenzyl triphenylphosphonium chloride 1.68 g , potassium carbonate 0.5 g and methanol 10 ml was heated at 60 70 for 2 hours, then left at room temperature for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered, the separated solids were washed with methanol, and the combined organic solutions were evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by medium pressure liquid chromatography on silica, eluting with chloroform, to give 1 2,4 difluorophenyl 2 3 4 methoxystyryl 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 1 1,2,4 triazol 1 ylmethyl ethanol, m.p. 150 152 . The 1 2,4 difluorophenyl 2 3 formyl 1 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl 1 1,2,4 triazol 1 ylmethyl ethanol used as starting material in the above process may be obtained as follows This product 2.0 g was dissolved in 2N hydrochloric acid 25 ml and stirred for 16 hours at room temperature, then neutralised with solid sodium bicarbonate and extracted with ethyl acetate 3 x 50 ml . The extracts were combined and dried, and the solvent was evaporated to give an oil which crystallised on trituration with anhydrous diethyl ether to give the required starting material, m.p. 85 87 .
