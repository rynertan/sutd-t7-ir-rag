# DECAFFEINATION OF FERMENTED UNFIRED TEA

## Abstract
Fermented, but unfired, green tea leaf material is contacted with a decaffeination fluid in order to effect removal of caffeine from the tea. After this decaffeination step, which preferably takes place in the absence of oxygen, the tea leaf material is fired in order to develop a black tea flavor. The preferred decaffeination fluid is a supercritical fluid with carbon dioxide being the preferred supercritical fluid. The product produced is superior to product obtained by decaffeinating green, unfermented tea or black tea.
