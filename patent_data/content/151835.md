# Process for producing pentachloronitrobenzene from hexachlorobenzene.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for producing pentachloronit robenzene PCNB by reacting hexachlorobenzene HEX with sodium hydrosulfide NaSH in the presence of sodium hydroxide NaOH , sodium carbonate Na₂CO₃ , or mixtures thereof to produce the sodium salt of pentachlorothiophenol PCTP , followed by reacting it or PTCP itself after acidifying with nitric acid in the presence of sulfuric acid or oleum.
