# Apparatus and method for slit radiography with different x ray energies.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for slit radiography a body 1 to be irradiated is scanned at least twice by means of a planar, fan X ray beam 4 emitted from an X ray source 1 via a slit diaphragm 2 , the hardness of which beam increases with each next scanning motion. An X ray detector 6 mounted behind the body collects the radiation passed, and sections of detection means 10 juxtaposed in the longitudinal direction of the X ray detector, produce electrical signals depending upon the radiation col lected by the respective X ray detector sections, which signals are sampled during each scanning motion and are stored in a memory 13 . The diaphragm 2 includes controllable ele ments 22 juxtaposed in the longitudinal direction of the slit in a number corresponding to that of the sections of the detection means. The controllable elements are each opera tive to locally block the slit diaphragm during a next scanning motion if a stored signal produced by the corresponding sec tion of the detection means during a preceding scanning motion exceeds a predetermined value.
