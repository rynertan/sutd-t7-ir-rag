# Hollow fibre membrane type fluid separation apparatus.

## Abstract
A hollow fiber membrane type fluid separation appar atus useful for selective separation of fluids in various techniques such as gas permeation, liquid permeation, dialysis, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, etc., which compris es at least one pair of unit structures 4 which are arranged uniaxially in series within a cylindrical pressure vessel 1 , said pair of unit structures comprising a pair of cylindrical hollow fiber assemblies 4 having a selective permeability, a means 7 for collecting permeated fluid, which is held between side tube sheets provided each at a terminal of the pair of cylindrical hollow fiber assemblies and is capable of collecting the fluid which passes through the side tube sheet, a permeation fluid pipe 6 for taking out the permeated fluid, which penetrates perpendicularly the means for col lecting a permeated fluid 7 at the center, and a fitting means 8 provided with a passageway 16 for passing a concentrated fluid being not permeated, said passageway being arranged at around central region 15 of the means for collecting a permeated fluid so as to surround the permeation fluid pipe.
