# Secondary battery using non aqueous solvent.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a secondary battery using a non aque ous solvent which comprises using a carbonaceous material obtained by carbonating an organic compound and having a pseudographite structure of a hydrogen carbon ratio being 0.15 or less, a d₀₀₂ being 3.37 Å or more and a Lc being 150 Å or less as a negative electrode. The battery has a large electric density, less in self dis charging and excellent in preservability.
