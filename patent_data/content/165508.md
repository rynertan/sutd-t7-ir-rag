# METAL CONTAINING PHENOLIC COATING COMPOSITONS

## Abstract
Divalent metal complexes of novolacs act as modifiers for alkyds, drying oils, epoxy esters, epoxy resins and thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers. Lamellar, non lamellar and spherical pigments improve corrosion and salt spray resistance of coatings mmade from these compositions.
