# Method for making an exhaust valve for a Diesel engine.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with an exhaust valve 1 for Diesel engine and a method thereof, in which a seat of the exhaust valve is formed with coated layer A comprising ceramics and metals, the layer becoming thicker in density of ceramics as coming nearly to the surface thereof. The seat may be formed with the coated layer A by subjecting to pressing heating treatment coating. This kind of the exhaust valve is provided by coating ceramics and metals onto a seating portion of the mother material such that ceramics becomes thicker in density as advancing to the surface, and heating the coated layer A in electric conductivity while pressing the layer with the tool 5 in non oxidizing atmosphere.
