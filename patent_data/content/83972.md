# Composite laminate joint structure and method and apparatus for making same.

## Abstract
A composite laminate joint structure tapered at one or both ends provides a coupling tensile strength greater than the laminate interlaminar shear strength. The joint structure is composed of individual ply structures 2,1,3 bonded by adhesive. The ply structures are made up of filament strands orientated in different directions and in a manner to provide the taper. A tubular form of the joint structure finds particular application to mechanically joined structure such as pipe and trusses. Methods of and apparatus for making such joint structures are also disclosed.
