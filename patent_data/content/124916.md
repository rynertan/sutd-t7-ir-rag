# Flame retardant polyphenylene ether composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a polymer composition based on a polyphenylene ether which is suitable for wire insulation extrusion. The polymer composition comprises a polyphenylene ether, optionally a polystyrene, a hydroge nated block copolymer, an aromatic phosphate compound, a mineral oil and optionally typical additives. The invention also relates to an electrically conductive wire comprising an insu lation built up from the above mentioned polymer composi tion and provided around the electrically conductive wire by wire insulation extrusion.
