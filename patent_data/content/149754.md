# LIQUID CRYSTAL COMPOUND, LIQUID CRYSTAL COMPOSITION AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICE

## Abstract
The present liquid crystal compounds are novel ester type compounds showing a smectic liquid crystal phase and being capable of increasing a dielectric constant anisotropy, represented by the following general formula R X₁ Y₁ X₂ Y₂ NO₂, wherein R is an alkyl group X₁ and X₂ are the same or different from each other and are group COO and OOC , and when X₁ is group COO ,
