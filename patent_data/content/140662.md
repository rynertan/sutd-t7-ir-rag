# Low stressed rationally shaped core support.

## Abstract
The lower end of a nuclear reactor core barrel 16 is lat erally stabilized within the reactor pressure vessel 10 by four auxiliary support structures 100 equiangularly disposed about the periphery of the reactor lower hemispherical shell 12 . The core barrel lower support plate 18 has keys 122 secured thereto for disposition within recesses 114 defined within crossbeams 102 of the structures 100 through which horizontal radial and tangential forces, as well as severe verti cal loads, are transmitted from the core barrel 16 to the reac tor vessel 10 . Shock absorbers 120 interconnect the keys 122 and the crossbeams 102 , and divergent brackets 104 serve to radially space the crossbeam 102 from the shell wall 12 so as to define a vertical coolant flow channel 108 through each structure 100 . The divergent brackets 104 serve to distribute radial loads from the core barrel 16 to the pressure vessel 10 as radial compression forces, and to con vert tangential bending moments into circumferential shear and radial compression forces. Upper inclined portions 162 of the brackets 104 serve to vertically centralize the center of load 160 of horizontal tangential forces relative to the brack ets centers of gravity 152 so as to eliminate vertical bending moments, and inclined lower portions 139 of the brackets 104 serve to convert vertical bending loads into circumferen tial shear and radial compression forces.
