# Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus includes a con trol section 3 attached to the proxlmal end portion of an insertion section 1 , an ultrasonic transducer 20 rotatably attached to the distal end portion of the in sertion section 1 , a driving shaft 30 having one end connected with the ultrasonic transducer 20 and the other end located at the control section 3 , a driving motor 38 in the control section 3 for rotating the driving shaft, a rotating cylinder 34 attached to the other end of the driving shaft to rotate together with the driving shaft, a pair of ring terminals 46, 47 at tached to the rotating cylinder to rotate together with the rotating cylinder, a signal cable 33 connected be tween the ultrasonic transducer and the rotating ter minal and passed through the driving shaft and the rotating cylinder to be rotated together with the rotating cylinder 34 , and a pair of fixed spring terminals 48, 49 at the control section 3 normally in contact with the ring terminals.
