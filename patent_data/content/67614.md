# Joint between the optical fibres of the conductors of an overhead electric transmission system.

## Abstract
In an overhead electric transmission system in which the phase conductors incorporate optical fibres, a joint between optical fibres 18 of two phase conductors 1 or between optical fibres of a phase conductor and an optical cable extending to a sub station is enclosed within a fluid tight metal housing 23. The housing is electrically connected to each phase conductor 1, is electrically insulated from earth, and has an external shape of such a form as to provide effective control of electrical stress. Preferably the metal housing 23 is of hemi spherical shape and is mounted on top of a porcelain insulator 21 containing oil 31 under pressure. Where an optical fibre connected at the joint is that of an optical cable, it passes into the metal housing 23 through the oil filled porcelain insulator 21.
