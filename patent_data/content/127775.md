# Subharmonic controller for electromagnetic exciter.

## Abstract
A subharmonic controller for a dual coil electromagnetic vibrator, which derives both power and timing from a conven tional a.c. line, having a zero crossing detector providing pulses at twice line frequency to a phase control. The phase control provides a selectively variable pulse width and trig gers a frequency divider, which in turn triggers a divide by two counter. Pulses from each of the phase control, divider and counter are fed to a logic controller which generates plus and minus gate signals. The gate signals alternately fire a pair of oppositely directed SCR s, each SCR connected in series with one of the dual coils across the a.c. line. A polarity detec tor and reset circuit restore the polarity information and sync hronize it with the direction of conduction of the SCR s.
