## Description
HALOGENATED HYDROCARBONS This invention relates to halogenated hydrocarbons and particularly to chlorinated mixed paraffinic hydrocarbons. Chlorinated straight chain paraffinic hydrocarbons, usually referred to simply as chlorinated paraffins, are well known materials which are used extensively in industry in a wide variety of applications, for example as plasticizers for vinyl chloride and other polymers and copolymers and as additives in coatings, adhesives and lubricants.They are produced by chlorinating straight chain paraffin oils and waxes containing carbon chains of length in the range from about 10 to about 30 carbon atoms to a chlorine content of greater than about 20 percent by weight, typically from about 40 to about 708 by weight. Although chlorinated single paraffins are known, the common commercially available products comprise mixtures obtained by chlorinating mixed paraffins of different carbon chain length. The mixed paraffin fractions or cuts used in the production of the common products are a nominal C C fraction, a nominal 10 13C C fraction and a nominal C C fraction. 14 17 20 30In practice, each nominal fraction or cut may contain small amounts, for example a few percent, of paraffins of chain length outside the specified range thus for example the nominal C c fraction may contain 10 13 small proportions of one or more of a C8, C91 C14 14 and C paraffin. 15 The chlorinated paraffins have always, at least until recently, been regarded as materials of a very low order of toxicity whose use in large amounts posed minimal or no environmental problems. This still appears to be the case in respect of long chain chlorinated paraffins such as the common C C products and 14 17C C products. In recent years, however, 20 30 laboratory experiments under rigorous conditions of continuous exposure of specimens to chlorinated paraffins in water for long periods, for example up to 60 days, have revealed that the short chain chlorinated paraffins such as the C C products can be toxic to certain 10 13 aquatic species.For example, the C C products 10 13 exhibit evidence of toxicity under conditions of continuous exposure towards rainbow trout at concentrations greater than about 30 micrograms per litre and towards seawater mussels at concentrations greater than about 10 to 12 micrograms per litre. The susceptibility of test species to the short chain chlorinated paraffins has been shown to depend to some extent upon the chlorine content of the products, being in general greater the higher the chlorine content, but toxicity has been observed in respect of the commonC C product containing about 50 60 percent by 10 13 weight chlorine. Evidence has also been reported of bioaccuinulation of these short chain, chlorinated paraffins in several aquatic species such as trout, bleak and mussels. Although the C C chlorinated paraffins 10 13 exhibit toxic effects only under rigorous experimental conditions, it is nevertheless desirable, especially in view of the observed bioaccumulation in aquatic species, to provide alternative products which do not exhibit such effects. We have now found, using rainbow trout as the principal test species, that the observed toxicity of chlorinated short chain paraffins and notably of the common C C products, is not exhibited at 10 13 concentrations up to 1000 micrograms per litre by chlorinated mixed paraffins of chain length C and 12 greater providing that the mixture is free or essentially free from paraffins of chain length C and less. 11 According to the present invention there is provided a chlorinated paraffins composition of chlorine content from 20 70 by weight based on the chlorinated paraffins and comprising a chlorinated mixture of a C paraffin and one or more paraffins of 12 chain length greater than 12 carbon atoms. A preferred embodiment of the invention resides in a chlorinated mixed paraffin composition comprising chlorinated paraffins of chain lengths 12, 13, 14 and optionally 15 carbon atoms. The compositions are preferably free or essentially free from chlorinated paraffins of chain length below 12 carbon atoms and in particular preferably contain less than 3 and especially less than 1 by weight based on the total chlorinated paraffins of chlorinated paraffins of chain length 11 or less carbon atoms. It is especially preferred that the content of chlorinated paraffins of 11 or less carbon atoms be less than 0.5 by weight of the total weight of chlorinated paraffins. The chlorinated mixed paraffins provided according to the invention may be produced by chlorination of a suitable mixed paraffin feedstock to the desired chlorine content in known manner. Any of the known methods for the production of chlorinated paraffins may be employed, these methods generally comprising passing chlorine gas into the liquid paraffins at a temperature above about 8DOC. The chlorinated paraffin compositions of the invention may contain any of the additives such as stabilizers and modifying agents normally incorporated in chlorinated paraffin compositions and they may be used in any of the applications in which chlorinated paraffins are commonly used. Compositions containing relatively short chain chlorinated paraffins and in particular compositions containing chlorinated C12, C13, C14 andC paraffins can be used in applications where the 15 common C C product is deemed to be unacceptable 10 13 owing to its observed toxicity.
