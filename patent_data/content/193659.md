## Abstract
An article in the form of a long, narrow basket having a rounded C shape interior bottom surface with an elon gated lip portion at one end. The lip portion extends sub stantially perpendicular to the sides of the main portion of the basket with the portion furthest from the main portion of the basket being relatively flat with sides developing as the lip portion joins the remainder of the basket to blend the interior surface of the lip portion to that of the main portion of the basket without irregularities. The article also includes a long handle attached to the basket at the end opposite the lip portion, and a flexible hand securing means with adjust able finger slots. The interior of the scoop is manufactured of a single piece of resilient material in the form of a series of accordion like indentations running along the surface to absorb the impact of the ball when caught, and to impart spin to the ball when thrown.
