# Pulse code modulated signal processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A PCM signal processing apparatus arranged to receive successive transmission blocks, each of which comprises time interleaved PCM data, error correction and error detec tion words, and which comprises a detecting circuit 13 re sponsive to error detecting words for detecting if a received transmission block contains an error, an error identifying cir cuit 17 for identifying as being erroneous each of the time in terleaved words included in the received transmission block which has been detected as containing an error, a de interleav ing circuit 15 , a syndrome generating circuit 16 , an error correcting circuit 19 , an error compensating circuit 20 , an inhibit device 23 for inhibiting the error compensating device in the state where the location of the erroneous word is un known in a predetermined successive number of blocks, and a slew rate control circuit 25 or filter device coupled to the de interleaving circuit 15 for passing the de interleaved PCM word at a predetermined slew rate, and a switching circuit 24 responsive to the output of the inhibit circuit 23 selecting the slew rate of the slew rate control circuit 25 or the filter device.
