# Hybrid optical wavelength division multiplexer demultiplexer.

## Abstract
There are disclosed a hybrid optical wavelength division multiplexer for one directional transmission, a hybrid optical wavelength division demultiplexer for one directional transmission, and a hybrid optical wavelength division multiplexer demultiplexer for bidirectional transmission. The multiplexer demultiplexer has light emitting diodes and photodetectors integral with an optical wavelength division multiplexer demultiplexer, with input and output ports comprising electric interfaces, with the result that there is required no optical fiber coupling system between the light emitting diodes and photodetectors and the optical wavelength division multiplexer demultiplexer. The hybrid multiplexer, demultiplexer, or the multiplexer demultiplexer is small in size and light in weight The hybrid optical wavelength division multiplexer for one directional transmission has collimator lenses for converting light of different wavelengths emitted from the light emitting diodes into parallel beams of light, interference filters of different transmittivities for multiplexing the parallel beams of light, and another collimator lens for converging and coupling the modulated beams of light to the common port optical fiber. The hybrid optical wavelength division demultiplexer for one directional transmission demultiplexer light of different wavelengths from the common port optical fiber, the demodulated light being detected by the photodetectors. The hybrid optical wavelength division multiplexer demultiplexer for bidirectional transmission is a combination of the multiplexer and demultiplexer.
