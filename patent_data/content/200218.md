## Description
This invention relates to new compounds which are useful in photodiagnosis and phototherapy, especially in the detection and treatment of tumors and cancerous tissues in the human or animal body. It is known to irradiate tumors and cancerous tissues in the human body with intensive light following administration of a hematoporphyrin derivative in the wavelength range of 626 to 636 nanometers to reduce and, at times, destroy the cancerous cells see PCT published specification WO 83 00811 . It is also known that porphyrins, especially the sodium salt of protoporphyrins, can maintain or promote the normal functions of cells and are useful for preventing the genesis, growth, metastasis , and relapse of malignant tumors. Japanese Published Patent Application No. 125737 76 describes the use of porphyrins as tumor inhibiting agents, exemplifying etioporphyrin, mesoporphyrin, protoporphyrin, deuteroporphyrin, hematoporphyrin, coprophyrin, and uroporphyrin. In Tetrahedron Letters No. 23, pp. 2017 2020 1978 , there is described an amino monocarboxylic acid adduct of the pigment bonellin obtained by extraction of principally the body wall of the marine echuroid Mesoporphyrin and mesohaemin PCT Patent Application No. WO 84 01382 describes the use of a new derivative of hematoporphyrin as useful in the localization and treatment of tumors. EP A 0168831 and EP A 0168832 both published on 22nd January 1986 disclose fluorescent mono, di or polyamides of an aminodicarboxylic acid and a tetrapyrrole containing carboxy groups. The compounds are noted to be useful for the detection and or treatment of mammalian tumors. That the tetrapyrroles cause intense photosensitivity in animals is well known and has been documented in numerous articles in literature, e.g., J. Intr. Sci. Vitaminol, 27, 521 527 1981 Agric. Biol. Chem., 46 9 , 2183 2193 1982 Chem. Abst. The new products contemplated by this invention are a fluorescent mono ,di or polyamide of an aminomonocarboxylic acid and a tetrapyrrole compound of the formula wherein The cyclic tetrapyrroles of the present invention are based upon the common parent tetrapyrrole, uroporphyrinogen, and which has the following ring structure in which the positions in the molecule are numbered 1 20, and the rings identified by letters A, B, C and D. There are present in the ring system four pyrrole rings joined through the alpha positions of the respective pyrrole rings by a methine group, i.e., CH . The tetrapyrroles employed in the present invention are all known or derived by various means and various alteration procedures from natural tetrapyrroles. The naturally occurring tetrapyrroles have as their common ancestor uroporphyrinogen III, a hexahydroporphyrin reduced at the bridge positions. A further characteristic of the present new compounds is the presence of at least one amide linkage in a substituent at any of the numbered positions of the ring structure. These are present in the instant new compounds together with other substituents as defined hereinafter. Thus, the present invention contemplates amino acid or peptide derivatives of compounds which contain the chromophore of certain chlorins and bacteriochlorins, as well as related porphyrin compounds. The peptide linkage involves a carboxy group of the chromophore bearing compound and the amino group of an aminomonocarboxylic acid. The present new compounds embrace derivatives of the tetrapyrroles which contain three carboxy groups. These derivatives include porphyrins of the major classes of tetrapyrroles chlorins and bacteriochlorins, which are well known to those skilled in this art. The amino acid employed in the present invention to form the aforesaid peptide linkage are amino monocarboxylic acids in which the amino group, of course, is located on a carbon atom of the carboxylic acid. The specific position of the amino group in the carbon atom chain is not critical, the only requirement being that the amino group be available to form the requisite peptide linkage with the carboxyl group of the selected porphyrin. Thus, a variety of amino monocarboxylic acids are useful in the present invention, including serine, glycine, methionine, α alanine, β alanine, α phenylalanine, ε aminocaproic acid, piperidine 2 carboxylic acid, pyrrole 2 carboxylic acid, piperidine 2 propionic acid, pyrrole 2 acetic acid, lysine, threonine, cysteine, and other natural amino acids. These amino acids may be substituted with angular alkyl groups such as methyl and ethyl groups, as well as other groups which do not adversely affect the capability of the amino group to form the peptide linkage, e.g., hydroxy, alkoxy groups or acyloxy groups, and may also include additional amino groups. Preferably, the amino acid is an alpha amino acid, and further that such an alpha amino acid is polar. It is further preferred that the amide is a mono , or diamide. The preferred amino acids are polar amino acids, particularly the naturally occurring polar α amino acids, serine, methionine, threonine and cysteine, which are readily available and, up to the present, have provided the best results. For the purpose of this invention, polar amino acids include the amino acids containing, in addition to requisite amino and carboxylic acid groups, an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur containing groups, especially oxygen containing groups such as hydroxy, acetoxy and methoxy groups. Exemplary compounds of the tetrapyrrole classes are illustrated in Table I in which the numbered positions of the tetrapyrrole ring structure are used to designate the position of the indicated substituent. The absence of double bonds in the ring system is designated under dihydro with each set of numbers ring position indicating the absence of a double bond between the designated positions. Particularly preferred compounds of this invention include Mono, di and triserinyl chlorin Mono, di and triserinyl bacteriochlorin The present new compounds form salts with either acids or bases. The acid salts are particularly useful for purification and or separation of the final amide products as are the salts formed with bases. The base salts, however, are particularly preferred for diagnostic and therapeutic use as hereindescribed. The acid salts, are formed with a variety of acids such as the mineral acids, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric and sulfuric acids, organic acids such as toluenesulfonic and benezenesulfonic acids. The base salts include, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, triethylammonium, trimethylammonium, morpholine and piperidine salts and similar such salts. The acid and base salts are formed by the simple expediency of dissolving the selected amino acid tetrapyrrole amide in an aqueous solution of the acid or base and evaporation of the solution to dryness. The use of a water miscible solvent for the amide can assist in dissolving the amide. The final amide products can also be converted to metal complexes for example by reaction with metal salts. The magnesium complexes may be useful for the same purpose as the adduct product. Other metal complexes, as well as the magnesium complex, including, for example, iron and zinc, are useful to preclude contamination during processing of the adduct product by metals such as nickel, cobalt and copper, which are difficult to remove. Zinc and magnesium are readily removed from the final adduct product after processing is completed. Since many of the aminodicarboxylic acids exist in both the D and L forms, and also are employed in mixtures of these forms as well as the D,L form, the selection of the starting amino acid well, of course, result in products in which the respective isomer or mixture of isomers exist. The present invention contemplates the use of all such isomers, but the L form is particularly preferred. The present new compounds are prepared by the usual peptide synthetic routes which generally include any amide forming reaction between the selected amino acid and the specific tetrapyrrole. Thus, any amide forming derivative of the tetrapyrrole carboxylic acid can be employed in producing the present new peptides, e.g., lower alkyl esters, anhydrides and mixed anhydrides. The preferred preparative methods use mixed anhydrides of the carboxylic acid or carbodiimides. The reactants are merely contacted in a suitable solvent therefor and allowed to react. Temperatures up to the reflux temperature can be used, with the higher temperatures merely reducing the reaction time. Excessively high temperatures are usually not preferred so as to avoid unwanted secondary reactions however. The procedures for forming the instant peptides are well known in this art and are provided in detail in the accompanying examples. When the selected tetrapyrrole contains at least three carboxyl groups, then mixtures of products can be formed including isomeric monopeptide products and di and even tri or higher peptide products, depending on the number of carboxyl groups and depending on the selected stoichiometry. Thus, when equimolar mixtures of amino acid and tetrapyrrole are reactd, not only monopeptides but also dipeptides are obtained, although the monopeptide would predominate. With higher molar ratios, the nature of the products will similarly vary. It is generally possible to separate the monopeptides and higher peptides using known chromatographic techniques. However, such separations are not necessary since the mixed peptides are usually comparable to the separated products in their ultimate use. Thus, mixtures of the mono , di and tri peptides of the same tetrapyrrole can be used. Usually, unreacted tetrapyrrole is separated from the peptide products of the invention during purification as, for example, by chromatographic techniques. The compounds of the present invention are useful for the photodiagnosis and phototherapy of tumor, cancer and malignant tissue hereinafter referred to as tumor . When a man or animal having tumor is treated with doses of a compound of the present invention and when appropriate light rays or electromagnetic waves are applied, the compound emits light, i.e., fluorescence. Thereby the existence, position and size of tumor can be detected, i.e., photodiagnosis. When the tumor is irradiated with light of proper wavelength and intensity, the compound is activated to exert a cell killing effect against the tumor. This is called phototherapy . Compounds intended for photodiagnosis and phototherapy ideally should have the following properties In accordance with testing up to the present, the present new compounds have the foregoing properties and are also characterized by reasonable solubility in saline at physiological pH. The present new compounds possess greater fluorescence in tumors than do the corresponding basic tetrapyrroles. Their use provides the best contrast in tumors compared to normal tissue around the tumor. The instant compounds absorb activating energy for phototherapy in the convenient range of 600 to 800 nanometers, with the preferred compounds absorbing in the 620 760 nanometer range, i.e., light of longer wavelengths which more readily permits penetration of energy into the tumor for phototherapeutic purpose. In present experience, the present compounds more uniformly distribute throughout the tumor than the basic tetrapyrrole permitting the use of considerably lower dosage to about 1 10th of the required normal dose of the basic tetrapyrrole which lessens, if not eliminates, photosensitization in the host. They also possess a more consistent fluorescence whereas some of the corresponding tetrapyrroles show inconsistent fluorescence or the fluorescence varies from day to day in the host. A particularly advantageous property of the present compounds resides in the ease with which they are excreted by the host. Generally, within 24 to 72 hours of intravenous or intraperitonal administration, there are little or no detectable amounts in normal muscle tissue. Up to about 50 of the present compounds are recovered from the feces of the host within 24 72 hours of injection whereas under equivalent circumstances, substantial amounts of the corresponding tetrapyrroles remain, and up to about 20 of peptides formed with amino monocarboxylic acids remain. This property is extremely important in that it contributes to minimization of photosensitization of the host. The instant compounds can be used for diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of a broad range of tumors. Examples of tumors are gastric cancer, enteric cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, uterine cancer, esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, pharyngeal cancer, sarcomas, hepatic cancer, cancer of the urinary bladder, cancer of the upper jaw, cancer of the bile duct, cancer of the tongue, cerebral tumor, skin cancer, malignant goiter, prostatic cancer, cancer of the parotid gland, Hodgkins s disease, multiple myeloma, renal cancer, leukemia, and malignant lymphocytoma. For diagnosis, the sole requirement is that the tumor be capable of selectively fluorescing when exposed to proper light. For treatment, the tumor must be penetrable by the activation energy. For diagnosis, light of shorter wavelength is used whereas for therapeutic purposes light of longer wavelength is used to permit ready penetration of the tumor tissue. Thus, for diagnosis, light of from 360 760 nanometers can be used, and for treatment, from 620 to 760, depending on the individual characteristics of the tetrapyrrole. The absorption characteristics of the present new compounds are substantially the same as the tetrapyrrole from which derived. It is necessary that the light rays be so intense as to cause the compounds to emit fluorescence for diagnosis and to exert a cell killing effect for therapy. The source of irradiation for photodiagnosis and phototherapy is not restricted, however, but the laser beam is preferable because intensive light rays in a desired wavelength range can be selectively applied. For example, in photodiagnosis, the compound of the invention is administered to a human or animal body, and after a certain period of time, light rays are applied to the part to be examined. When an endoscope can be used for the affected part, such as lungs, gullet, stomach, womb, urinary bladder or rectum, it is irradiated using the endoscope, and the tumor portion selectively emits fluorescence. This portion is observed visually, or observed through an adapted fiber scope by eye or on a CRT screen. In phototherapy, after administration of the dosage, the irradiation is carried out by laser beams from the tip of quartz fibers. Besides the irradiation of the surface of tumor, the internal part of the tumor can be irradiated by inserting the tip of quartz fibers into the tumor. The irradiation can be visually observed or imaged on a CRT screen. For photodiagnosis, light of wavelengths between 360 and 760 nm. is suitable for activating the present tetrapyrrole compounds. Of course, each compound has a specific optimal wavelength of activation. A long wavelength ultraviolet lamp is particularly suitable for photodiagnosis. Similar methods for viewing of the treated tumor can he used as already described for phototherapy. The dosages of the present new compounds will vary depending on the desired effect, whether for diagnosis or for treatment. For diagnosis, doses of as little as 1 mg kg will be effective, and up to about 7.5 mg kg can be used. For treatment, the dose will usually approximate about 0.5 mg kg. Of course, the dosage for either diagnosis or treatment can be varied widely in view of aforesaid advantageous properties of the present compounds, e.g., the ease of elimination from the host, for one. The present compounds are apparently non toxic at the dosage levels employed for diagnosis or treatment. No mortality of test animals due the present compounds has been noted in studies employing dosage levels up to 20 mg kg. For both diagnosis and treatment, the present compounds can be administered by the oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes. They can be formulated as lyophilized sterile, pyrogen free compounds, preferably in the form of basic salts, e.g., sodium salt. The preferred dosage forms are provided as injectable solutions isotonic . The irradiation source used in treatment of tumors containing compounds of this invention is a filtered, high intensity, continuous source or pumped dye, or other laser and light delivery system, which is capable of performing within the following limits power intensity 20 500 mw cm² at wavelengths between 620 and 680 nm. and a total output of at least 4 watts or greater. Several currently commercially available lasers meet these criteria. The tetrapyrroles can be prepared by various synthetic methods which are found in the literature, e.g., Willstatter, R., Stoll, A. Fischer and Orth, Des Chemie des Pyrrole Akademische Verlazsgesellschaft, Leipzig, 1940, Vol. II, Part 2. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins ed. Kevin M. Smith, Elsevier 1975 N.Y. The compounds of the present invention can be administered to the host in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally, intraveneously, intramuscularly or subcutaneous routes. The active compound may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or it may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or it may be compressed into tablets, or it may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60 of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions or preparations according to the present invention are prepared so that an oral dosage unit form contains between about 50 and 300 mg of active compound. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following A binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin excipients such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabons as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained release preparations and formulations. The active compound may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions of the active compound as a free base or pharmacologically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporanous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile filtered solution thereof. The present new compounds may also be applied directly to tumors, whether internal or external, in the host in topical compositions. Exemplary compositions include solutions of the new compounds in solvents, particularly aqueous solvents, most preferably water. Alternatively, for topical application particularly to skin tumors, the present new compounds may be dispersed in the usual cream or salve formulations commonly used for this purpose or may be provided in the form of spray solutions or suspensions which may include a propellant usually employed in aerosol preparations. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatable with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of tumors in living subjects.

The rats are injected with a solution of the chlorin prepared as follows 20 mg of the sodium salt of the chlorin was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.9 NaCl. The chlorin solution was then injected intravenously through the external jugular while the rat was anesthetized with ether. The volume of solution injected was calculated based upon the weight of the animal and the dosage, on a weight to weight basis, for the particular experiment. A specified time interval was then allowed to elapse before light treatment was instigated. Light treatment of the rats was without anesthesia. The rats were restrained, the hair removed in the treatment area and treated with laser light from a Cooper Aurora argon pumped, tunable dye laser. The laser was equipped with a fiber optic light delivery system coupled to a microlens system developed by Dr. Daniel Doiron, D.R.D. Consulting, Santa Barbara, California. The lens disperses the laser beam, providing a circular distribution of light with homogenous light intensity throughout the area of the incident light beam. The wavelength of light was adjusted using a Hartridge reversion spectroscope. The light intensity was determined using a Yellow Springs Instrument, Model 65A, radiometer. The micro lens was positioned at such a distance from the skin of the animal so as to provide an illumination diameter of 1.5cm, and the light flux was varied by control of the laser output. Subsequent to illumination, the animal was returned to its cage and, 24 hours later, it was treated intravenously in the external jugular vein with 14 mg of Evans Blue dye, dissolved in 250 µl of 0.9 NaCl. Two hours after injection, the rat was sacrificed and the tumor cross sectioned. The extent of tumor necrosis was assessed by the lack of dye uptake , and the depth of the necrotic cross section of the tumor was recorded in millimeters. Table III summarizes the effects of these drugs on tumors. The conditions described result in measurable and significant damage to the tumors. In all cases except where noted, tissue damage occurred selectively to the tumor tissue as assayed by the Evans Blue method, even though, in nearly all cases, normal skin overlayed the tumor and the treatment area overlapped significant areas of normal muscle tissue. The photodynamic therapy data is presented in tabular form. Column No. 2 is the total light dose administered in terms of Joules per square centimeter. Column No. 3 is the dose of chlorin administered in terms of mg of drug per kilogram of rat body weight. Column No. 4 is the time lapse between administration of drug and treatment with laser light. Column No. 5 is the wavelength of treatment light in nanometers. Column No. 6 is the intensity of the treatment light in milliwatts per square centimeter. In Column No. 7, S.D. is the standard deviation of N is the number of tumors or legs involved in the experiment. Column No. 8 is the range of depth of necrosis in millimeters within the group. The treatment and evaluation procedure is as follows Light from a Copper Aurora argon pumped tunable dye laser was administered via a micro lens system developed by Dr. Daniel Doiron, D.R.D. Consulting, Santa Barbara, California coupled through a quartz fiber to the laser, the optical properties of the lens are such that the light exits the lens in a circular pattern with homogenous intensity throughout the lighted area. The diameter of the lighted area is a function of the distance from the lens. The light intensity was measured with a Yellow Springs Instrument Model 65 A Radiometer at the point of treatment. A 1.5 cm diameter circle of the animal s skin, centered as closely as possible over the tumor, was irradiated in all the experiments. The intensity, wavelength, and dosage of light is included in the data for individual groups of animals. Wavelengths are adjusted, using a Hartridge reversion spectroscope to within 1 nm of the stated value. Twenty four hours after light treatment, each mouse received 5 mg of Evans Blue Dye intravenously The results of Table IV IX are summarized in Table X. The results of Table XI XII are summarized in Table XIII. The preparation of pharmacological dosages for the administration of the active ingredient, that is the amino acid porphyrin adducts, which were prepared in Examples hereinabove, is as follows A tablet base was prepared by blending the following ingredient in the proportion by weight indicated Into this base, there was blended sufficient amino acid porphyrin adducts to provide tablets each containing 100 mg. of active ingredient. A blend was prepared containing the following ingredients This blend was divided and formed into capsules each containing 25 mg of active ingredient. To a commercially available raspberry flavored sugar syrup is added the equivalent of 40 mg of the amino acid porphyrin adduct per milliliter and the mixture is homogenized in a mechanical device for this purpose. This mixture is especially suitable for oral administration containing 200 mg of the active ingredient. A sterile solution of the following composition is prepared 200 mg of the sodium salt of the amino acid porphyrin adduct is dissolved in a 0.9 NaCl solution so that the final concentration is 20 mg ml. This solution is suitable for I.V. and I.M. administration. The sodium salt of the amino acid porphyrin adduct is dissolved in 0.9 NaCl solution so that the final concentration is 5 mg ml. This is placed in an aerosal dispenser with a hydrocarbon propellant. This preparation is suitable for topical application. The sodium salt of the porphyrin amino acid adduct is prepared by dissolving said adduct in water containing an equimolar amount of sodium hydroxide and freeze drying the resulting mixture. In this fashion, other metal salts are prepared including potassium, calcium, and lithium salts. The amino acid porphyrin adduct described in the preceding examples are converted to acid salts, e.g., hydrochloride, by dissolving in an aqueous solution containing an equivalent amount of acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid, and the solution is evaporated to dryness to obtain the solid salt. Alternately, alcoholic solutions of hydrogen chloride gas, dissolved in ethanol can be used in lieu of the aqueous acid solution and the acid salt in obtained by evaporation of the solvent or crystallization from the alcohol, e.g., by addition of a non solvent.
