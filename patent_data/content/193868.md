# Measurement of optical density via nephelometry.

## Abstract
A method for measuring the formation of optical density at 350 to 700 nm in a material is disclosed. The method com prises directing through a solution of the material with light scattering means suspended therein a beam of light having a wavelength in the range of 350 to 700 nm at which the material absorbs light, and measuring the scattered intensity of the light leaving the solution at a given angle.
