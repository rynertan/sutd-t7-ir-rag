## Description
GARMENT INSPECTION DEVICE THIS INVENTION relates to a garment inspection device. USA patent 3,023,940 to Schwartz shows a garment inspection device which comprises a base, a frame structure over which a garment to be inspected can be stretched, and a number of light bulbs for illuminating the garment from the inside when in position on the frame structure. The width of the frame structure can be adjusted to accommodate garments of different sizes, and the frame structure can rotate about a vertical axis with respect to the base. The height of the frame structure above the base can also be adjusted in order to suit the height of a particular operator. Vertical adjustment of the frame structure has to be carried out manually and would require both hands of the operator.It would therefore not, with this device, be practical to adjust the height of the frame structure during inspection of a garment, if it is also desired to inspect the garment rapidly with a minimum expense of time.If the height is set so that the bottom of the garment is at the level of the operator s eyes, the operator will not be able to inspect the top of the garment properly. On the other hand, if the height is set so that the top of the garment is at the level of the operator s eyes, the operator will have to bend down each time a garment is being inspected in order properly to inspect the hem of the garment.This would lead to operator fatigue, and impair the speed at which garments can be inspected. In order to pull a garment over the frame structure ofSchwartz, it has to be stretched to its full width, otherwise it will become snagged on the upper ends of the frame structure. This will further impair the speed at which a garment can be inspected.Adjustment of the width of the frame structure takes place by loosening, making the desired adjustments, and again fastening four wing nuts at the bottom of the frame structure. At the top of the frame structure there are telescopically slidable parts which limit the minimum width of the frame structure to somewhat more than half the maximum width. Mention is made of a fluorescent light source in place of the light bulbs, but no indication is given as to how such a fluorescent light source is to be arranged. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved garment inspecting device which will permit rapid and thorough inspection of garments with a minimum of operator fatigue, and which will permit rapid adjustment to accommodate garments of widely differing sizes. Other objects of the invention will become apparent from the description of the invention which follows hereafter. According to the invention there is provided a garment inspection device which comprises a base a frame structure suitable for having a garment stretched thereover, the frame structure being mounted on the base so as to be vertically displaceable and rotatable about a vertical axis of rotation with respect to the base and illuminating means arranged to be inside the garment when stretched over the frame structure characterised thereby that it includes an actuator for displacing the frame structure vertically with respect to the base. The device may further comprise a foot operated control for controlling operation of the actuator. The actuator may be a pneumatic cylinder.It may be a double acting pneumatic cylinder. The frame structure may comprise a pair of side frames which are displaceable towards and away from one another to adjust the width of the frame structure, each side frame including an upright portion and a shoulder portion sloping upwardly and inwardly from the upper end of the upright portion, and there being a rounded element between the shoulder portions extending to a level above the upper and inner ends of the shoulder portions. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a garment inspection device which comprises a base a frame structure suitable for having a garment stretched thereover, the frame structure being mounted on the base so as to be rotatable about a vertical axis of rotation with respect to the base, and the frame structure comprising a pair of side frames which are displaceable towards and away from one another to adjust the width of the frame structure and illuminating means arranged to be inside the garment when stretched over the frame structure characterised thereby that each side frame includes an upright portion and a shoulder portion sloping upwardly and inwardly from the upper end of the upright portion, and that there is a rounded element between the shoulder portions extending to a level above the upper and inner ends of the shoulder portions. The device may further comprise a central column, each side frame being connected to the central column by an arm having first and second pivotally interconnected parts forming an elbow joint, and means for locking the parts together in a desired angular pOsition. The arms may be provided at or near the top of the upright portions of the side frames, the side frames being at or near their bottom ends, slidable along a guide connected to and extending laterally from the column. The rounded element may be a sphere having a diameter of between about 5 and 15 cm. A diameter of about 10 cm has been found to be particularly suitable. The illuminating means may be an upwardly extending fluorescent tube. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevation of a garment inspection device in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a broken, perspective view of part of the device Figure 3 is a top plan view of part of the width adjusting mechanism of the device and Figure 4 is a pneumatic diagram of the pneumatically operating parts of the device. The garment inspection device illustrated is generally designated 10 and comprises a base 12, a pneumatic cylinder 14 extending upwardly from the base, a central column 16, and a frame structure 18.The column 16 together with the frame structure 18 can be displaced vertically with respect to the base 12 by means of the pneumatic cylinder 14, and the frame strucuture 18 is rotatable about a vertical axis with respect to the column 16, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. The pneumatic cylinder 14 has a body 20 which, at the bottom, is secured to the base 12, and a piston rod 22 extending upwardly from the body. To the top of the body 20 there is secured a rectangularNylon block 24, the piston rod 22 extending through the block 24. The central column 16 comprises a lower cylindrical member 26 secured at the bottom to the upper end of the piston rod 22, a part 28 which houses an electrical fitting for one end of a fluorescent tube 30, a part 32 which houses an electrical fitting for the other end of the fluorescent tube, guard rods 34 extending between the two parts 28, 32, and an upper cylindrical member 36 extending upwardly from the part 32. To the lower cylindrical member 26 there is secured a Nylon block 38 and an electrical terminal box 40. There is an electrical supply cable 42 leading to the terminal box 40, and the terminal box 40 houses starter circuitry for the fluorescent tube 30. To the Nylon block 38 there are secured two downwardly extending guide rods 44, the guide rods extending with little clearance through corresponding openings in the Nylon block 24. The purpose of the guide rods 44 is to prevent the column 16 from rotating about a vertical axis with respect to the base 12. At the top of the upper cylindrical member 36 there is a hollow plastics sphere 46 which has a diameter of about locum. The lower cylindrical member 26 carries aNylon block 48. There is a bearing not shown which supports the Nylon block 48 vertically with respect to the cylindrical member 26, but permits the block to rotate about a vertical axis with respect to the cylindrical member 26. Parallel, horizontal members 50 are secured one to each side of the block 48 and extend laterally therefrom. Inwardly of the members 50 there are two guide rods 52 which pass through the block 48 and have their outer ends secured to the outer ends of the members 50. The frame structure 18 comprises a pair of side frames 54, each side frame 54 being constructed from a pair of spaced, parallel side frame members 56 connected together by spacers 58. Each side frame 54 comprises an upright portion 60 and a shoulder portion 62 sloping upwardly and inwardly from the upper end of the upright portion. Near the upper end of the upright portion 60, each side frame 54 is connected to a rotatable member 64 via a connecting arm 66. Each connecting arm 66 is in two parts 68 and 70 which are connected together pivotally at 72 so as to form an elbow joint. The arm part 70 is connected pivotally to one of the spacers 58, and the arm part 68 is connected pivotally to the rotatable member 64. The rotatable member 64 is rotatable on the upper cylindrical member 36.As will more clearly be seen in Figure 3, the pivotal connection between the arm portions 70 and 68 comprises a pair of nylon discs 74 which are screwed onto opposite ends of a screw threaded stud 76 and which, when tightened, clamp the two arm portions 68 and 70 between them. The lower end of each upright portion 60 is connected to a Nylon sliding block 78 which has openings through which the guide rods 52 pass with little clearance. When the pivotal connection 72 is loosened by unscrewing the discs 74, the side frames 54 can be moved away from or towards one another in order to adjust the width of the frame structure 18.Although the sliding blocks 78 can readily be displaced by hand along the guide rods 52 when the width of the frame structure 18 is to be adjusted, there is sufficient friction between the blocks 78 and the quide rods 52 to prevent displacement during normal use when a garment is pulled over or off the frame structure. Referring now also to Figure 4, there is a pneumatic line 80 leading to the device from a supply of compressed air not shown . Line 80 is connected to a service unit 82 which comprises a combined pressure regulator and water separator unit 84 having a pressure gauge mounted thereon, and a lubricator 86 in series with the unit 84. From the service unit 82 there is a pneumatic line 88 which leads to a 4 2 way valve 90 not visible in Figure 1 which can be operated by means of a foot pedal 92. A pneumatic line 94 leads from the valve 90 to the upper end of the cylinder 14, and a pneumatic line 96 leads from the valve 90 to the bottom end of the cylinder 14.The exhaust side of the valve 90 is connected to a throttle valve 98 not visible in Figure 1 which leads to atmosphere. In use of the device, the discs 74 are loosened and the side frames 54 pulled away from one another or pushed towards one another to adjust the width of the frame structure 18 so that it can accommodate a garment of a particular size. During such adjustment, the blocks 78 slide on the guide rods 52. The arms 66 allow the side frames 54 to be brought close together so that the device can be used even for very small garments. Once the side frames 54 are correctly adjusted, the discs 74 are tightened so as to prevent the side frames 54 from moving with respect to one another. The fluorescent light 30 is switched on by means of a switch not shown on the terminal box 40. A garment to be inspected, such as a Tshirt 100, is pulled over the frame structure 18, the sphere 46 and the sloping shoulder portions 62 facilitating this action and minimising the chances of the garment being snagged on the frame structure 18. Each side seam of the garment is positioned midway between the side frame members 56. This means that the front and back of the garment extend from he left hand side frame to the right hand side frame as viewed in Figure 1. The operator can now inspect the upper portion of the garment by rotating the frame structure 18 about the vertica l axis. If a side seam is not properly closed, this will clearly EG revealed by light from the fluorescent tube 30 shining through the hole thus formed.Some light also shines through the front and back of the garment so that any flaws in the material, or defects in printing if the garment has printing on it, are revealed. The operator can also carry out any trimming of the garment which may be necessary. This all takes pace with the pedal 92 in its undepressed condition, in which compressed air is admitted to the top end of the cylinder 14, keeping the piston rod 22 in its fully retracted position. In this position the eyes of the operator are at the level of the sleeves 102 and neck seam 104 of the T shirt. Once the upper portion of the T shirt has been inspected, the operator will depress the pedal 92. This will cause compressed air to be fed to the bottom end of the cylinder 14, the top end of the cylinder being connected via the throttle valve 98 to atmosphere. The piston rod 22 will then lift the column 16 and the frame structure 18, carrying the garment 100 with it, together with the block 38 and the terminal box 40, to a position in which the hem 106 of the garment is at about the level of the operator s eyes. During this movement the guide rods 44 are displaced slidably with respect to the block 24. The operator can now inspect the bottom part of the garment by again rotating the frame structure 18 about the vertical axis.Once this has been done, the pedal 92 is released, again causing compressed air to be admitted to the top end of the cylinder 14, and rapidly moving the piston rod 22, the column 16 and the frame structure 18 downwardly. The garment 100 is pulled off the frame structure 18 and the device 10 is now ready for inspecting the next garment. The garment will normally be inspected when in the inside out condition. This will enable the operator to carry out any trimming that may be necessary. The sphere 46 will assist the skilled operator in turning the garment into its correct condition in a single single movement as the garment is pulled off the frame structure. During inspection, the operator has both hands free to manipulate the garment during inspection, for turning it around, and for carrying out any trimming that may be necessary. The operator does not have to bend down for examining the hem. It will thus be seen that the device will facilitate proper inspection of garments rapidly and with a minimum of operator fatigue.
