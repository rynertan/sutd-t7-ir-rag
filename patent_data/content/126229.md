# Brake apparatus.

## Abstract
A brake apparatus 10 having a master cylinder 16 with a flange 24 connected to a first shell 56 of a booster 18 and a stationary firewall 71 of a vehicle. A first wall 70 located between the flange 24 and first shell is con nected to a piston 38 in the master cylinder 14 . A second wall 144 located between the first shell 56 , flange 24 and a second shell 121 is linked to the first wall 70 by a plurality of bolts 180 that pass through the flange 24 . A valve 102 in response to an input controls the development of a pressure differential across the first and second walls 70 and 144 . This pressure differential creates a force such that the first wall 70 pushes piston 38 while the second wall 144 pulls the first wall 70 to pressurize fluid in the master cylinder 16 . Since the flange 24 fixes the master cylinder 16 to a stationary firewall 71 , measurable axial deflection is eliminated and the entire input is used to operate valve 102 and effect a brake application.
