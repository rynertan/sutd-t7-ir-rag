# GUN MAGAZINE STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A gun magazine including a magazine body for holding a series of rounds of ammunition 15 , and a floor plate 29 at the lower end of the magazine body detachable therefrom by generally horizontally sliding movement relative to the body, with the floor plate 29 preferably containing a recess extending downwardly into the floor plate beneath the lower extremity of the magazine body and into which the main ammunition follower spring 26 projects downwardly. The floor plate 29 may be connected to the magazine body loosely, in a manner enabling slight upward and downward shifting movement of the plate 29 relative to body, and be provided with locking means for blocking lateral separation of the floor plate 29 from the magazine body but adapted to be released to permit such separation by a slight shifting movement of the floor plate 29 against the tendency of the main follower spring 26 . The follower 25 itself which is urged upwardly by that spring 26 , to advance the am munition 15 upwardly, is releasably retained in a lower position by a spring pressed latching element 32 to facilitate loading of rounds into the magazine.
