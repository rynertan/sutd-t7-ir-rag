# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING DEAERATED STOCK TO A PROCESSING MACHINE

## Abstract
Apparatus for supplying deaerated stock to a process ing machine incorporates an enclosed receiver and an open receiver open to the atmosphere. Stock deaerated by vac uum in the enclosed receiver flows to the processing ma chine, preferably via the open receiver. Some of such stock spills over a weir associated with the open receiver to maintain a constant level pond in such receiver. Such constant level pond minimizes stock pressure fluctuations at the machine. The apparatus may be provided with de vices for controlling the level of stock in the conduit leading from the enclosed receiver and for passing stock from the enclosed receiver to the conduit in a predictable flow pat tern to minimize generation of pulsations at the entry to the conduit. The stock spilling over the weir in the open receiver is recycled. During a temporary shutdown of the processing machine, the system may be maintained in operation with continuous recirculation of stock through the receivers to facilitate rapid restarting of the machine. Because there is no need for a pond of stock in the enclosed receiver, such receiver may be compact. The system may be installed in a preexisting mill and space within a preexisting vessel may be used for the open receiver.
