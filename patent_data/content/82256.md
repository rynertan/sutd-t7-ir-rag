# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE COMPRISING DIELECTRIC ISOLATION REGIONS

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, having the steps of forming a first mask pattern on a semiconductor layer 101 , through an SiO₂ film forming a thin layer on at least side surfaces of the first mask pattern selectively forming a second mask pattern on an SiO₂ film portion located between the thin layer portions formed on the side surface of the first mask pattern selectively etching the thin layer portions formed on the at least side surfaces of the first mask pattern, and the SiO₂ film portions under the thin layer portions formed on the side surfaces of the first mask pattern, using the first and second mask patterns selectively etching an exposed portion of the semiconductor layer 101 to form a trench 108 , and forming an element isolation region 111 or burying an insulating material 110 in the trench 108 .
