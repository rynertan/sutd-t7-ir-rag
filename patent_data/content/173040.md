# Vector processing system.

## Abstract
The vector processing system comprises a main me mory 3 for storing instructions and operands at least one scalar register 4 accessible by each of said instructions a plurality of vector registers V₀ V₇ each having a plurality of storage locations for holding a plurality of vector ele ments of an ordered set of data functional means for per forming a predetermined operation for at least one set of said vector elements in at least one vector register in re sponse to a first instruction. First storage means store the number MVL a positive integer of storage locations to be used in each of said vector registers. In response to a second instruction a control means transfers the content of said first storage means to either said scalar register or said main memory. The number of said vector elements are held by a second storage means and are supplied to said func tional means, based upon the content MVL of said first storage means transferred to either said scalar register or said main memory and the number N a positive integer of vector operations specified by a third instruction. Read out means sequentially read out said vector elements in said at least one vector register to said functional means in re sponse to the content of said second storage means. This vector processing system is capable of setting the number of storage locations to be used in vector registers.
