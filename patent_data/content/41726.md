# PROCESS FOR THE OXIDATION OF UNSATURATED HYDROCARBONS ESPECIALLY TO ACIDS OR KETONES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the oxidation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, particularly butenes and isobutylene, for the production of acetic acid, propionic acid and acetone. Specifically the invention comprises the highly selective oxidation of the unsaturated hydrocarbon or of the mixture of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the presence of a catalyst consisting of a complex of trivalent cobalt and of a carbonyl compound, of the aldehydic or ketonic type.
