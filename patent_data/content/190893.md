# Test kit and method for the determination of streptococcus mutans.

## Abstract
The semi quantitive detection of Streptococcus mutans from the oral cavity of a patient in vitro involves introducing saliva from a patient into a diluent solution to which has been added just before the saliva a predetermined powdered amount of bacitracin, and contacting the diluent solution with a sterile medium coated paddle, then incubating the medium coated paddle containing the diluent and test saliva, and thereafter semi quantitively determining the amount of Streptococcus mutans in the test saliva by comparing the percent of colony density on the paddle with a standard Streptococcus mutans colony density chart. The amount of Steptococcus mutans in the oral sample is indicative of the patient s predispostion towards dental caries. A test kit for the determination of Streptococcus mutans includes an asceptic first vial 12 having a paddle 20 bearing a coating of medium 22 comprising agar and sucrose, a second asceptic vial 14 containing a buffered saline solution, a predetermined amount of bacitracin 28 e.g. in pellet form, a carbon dioxide generating composition 26 , and standard Streptococcus mutans colony density charts 30 .
