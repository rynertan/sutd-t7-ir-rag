# Solid state imaging device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a solid state imaging device having a semi conductor integrated circuit in which a plurality of switching elements 4 for selecting positions of picture elements and scanners for turning on and off the switching elements in time sequence are disposed on a substrate 11 . A photocon ductive film 5 which is disposed on the integrated circuit is connected to impurity regions 9 of opposite conductivity type to the substrate, each region 9 forming one end of a respective switching element. A light transmitting electrode 7 is disposed on the photoconductive film. Carriers caused in the photoconductive film 5 by incident light are stored in the regions 9 . To reduce blooming, the breakdown voltage of the junction formed between the semiconductor substrate 11 and the impurity region 9 is made smaller than the breakdown voltage between the storing first impurity region 9 and a second impurity region 16 at the other end of the switching element 4 , from which a signal is read out.
