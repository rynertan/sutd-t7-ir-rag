# ETHYLHYDROXYALKYLMETHYLCELLULOSE ETHERS

## Abstract
Novel ethyl C₂ ₄ hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose ethers are disclosed which are soluble in a wide range of organic solvents, generally, thermoplastic and may be prepared having high molecular weights. These cellulose ethers are useful in organic systems as protective colloids, emulsifiers, film formers, thickeners and the like.
