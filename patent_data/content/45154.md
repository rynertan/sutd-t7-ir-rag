# Slotted plate terminal renewable as spade terminal.

## Abstract
Slotted plate terminal for insulated stranded wire 40 has folded side edges 24 on either side of the slot and a slit 26 in each edge 24 which leads to a curcular aperture 28 adja cent each wall of the slot. Wire 40 is terminated by insertion into slot and retained in the bottom by bending side edges 24 to close the slot. A low normal force remains on the strands in the bottom of the slot so that the possibility of the strands rearranging or stacking is minimized. Slotted portion may be severed at a score line 36 leaving spade type terminal 32 suitable for mating with standard clip terminal if repair is ne cessary
