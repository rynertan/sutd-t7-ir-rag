# NUMERICAL CONTROL UNIT.

## Abstract
A plurality of standard numerical control units 10a, 10b equipped with processors 11a, 11b are provided, and are able to execute data processing through the operational functions of the processors. The respective standard numer ical control unit is provided with a coupling circuit 14a, 14b, respectively , which functions as an interface circuit for data exchanging with the other standard numerical control units, so that one standard numerical control unit 10a as a master unit is coupled with another standard numerical control unit 10b as a slave unit through the coupling circuits 14a, 14 . Thus, a machine tool is kept under the numerical control executed by all the standard numerical control units 10a, 10b , which are wholly controlled by the master unit 10a .
