# Method of externally covering metal objects, e.g. tubes, with a synthetic resin layer.

## Abstract
A method of externally convering metal objects, for example tubes with a synthetic resin layer, in which tape shaped coating material is wound with a resin around the tube 1 , subsequently the tube is heated and after curing of the resin the tube is allowed to cool down. During the winding operation the tube is maintained approximately at room temperature and after the winding operation the tube is gradually heated up to a medium temperature range. By heating the tube itself the resin is gradually heated by the tube, so that the resin is slowly and evenly along the length of the tube becoming soft and fluid. Since the heating energy is for the larger part taken up by the tube the temperature rise of the resin coating is very stable.
