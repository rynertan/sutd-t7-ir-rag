# A conjugated diene copolymer, a process for producing the copolymer, and a photosensitive composition comprising the copolymer.

## Abstract
A conjugated diene copolymer comprising A 10 to 60 mole of conjugated diene compound units. B 5 to 50 mole of α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid units. C 0.1 to 20 mole of polyfunctional alkenyl compound units. D 0 to 10 mole of diene compound units having carbon carbon double bonds in a carbocyclic system and E 0 to 80 mole of monoolefinically unsaturated compound units, the sum of the amounts of units A , B , C , D , and E being 100 mole , and having an intrinsic viscosity η of 0.01 to 3.0 dl g measured at 30 C in dimethyl formamide is soluble in aqueous alkali solutions, excels in processability and pho tosetting property, and has excellent rubber elasticity and transparency even after photosetting. Accordingly, a pho tosensitive composition comprising the copolymer, a pho topolymerizable unsaturated monomer and a photosensitizer can greatly improve the complicated process for the pro duction of conventional rubber relief plates of flexographic printing, and shorten the production time.
