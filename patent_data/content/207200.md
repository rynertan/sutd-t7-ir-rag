# Hot melt material dispenser.

## Abstract
This relates to a dispenser for a hot melt material which is supplied in rod like form from a spool and which is heated to the required semi liquid dispensing state. The dispensing head is provided with a heating passage which provides for uniform heating of the rod like hot melt material and there is further provided a special piston having a throughbore through which hot melt material is fed into a pumping cylin der as the piston retracts after a pumping stroke so as to eliminate in the dispensing head downstream of the piston any momentary voids. There is also a feed mechanism which will feed the hot melt material in accordance with the demand of the dispensing head and which will urge the rod like hot melt material into the heating passage of the dispensing head under a preselected pressure so as to assure flow not only through the heating passage, but also through the piston. There are also provided means for detecting the existence of the rod like hot melt material in advance of the feed mechan ism to make certain that the apparatus be shut down when no hot melt material supply is available. There is also provided a reverse drive unit for retracting the previously fed hot melt material a short distance to relieve the build up of pressure in the heating passage when the dispensing operation is momentarily shut down and heat is still being applied to the hot melt material disposed within the heating passage.
