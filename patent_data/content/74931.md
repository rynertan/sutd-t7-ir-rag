# Procedure for processing with circular knitting machines and circular machines adopting said procedure.

## Abstract
Procedure for knitting hose with toe and heel in a circular machine having more than one feed and preferably a double needle bar, characterised by the facts that all the needles are brought to an upper path 38 during knitting of the toe and heel with alternating motion, and that at every oscillation of the cylinder those needles alone which have been selected to knit the course relative to said oscillation are brought back to work from said upper path 38 towards a lower working path 200 , whereby said selection is brought about by coopera tion between fixed radial cams 30 31 34 35 situated so as to correspond with the main feed and appropriate selection actuators 219 419 , said procedure being also characterised by the fact that the selection for jacquard designs takes place upwards from a lower path 39 to said upper path 38 by means of cooperation between appropriate selection actuators 319 519 and movable radial cams 24 32 25 33 located so as to correspond with each feed. According to the invention said upper path 38 serves to exclude the needles of the lower cylinder from work and also to protect the reversed needles, said lower path 39 being the path for jacquard designs. The invention also concerns a circular machine which has more than one feed and preferably a double cylinder and which employs said procedure.
