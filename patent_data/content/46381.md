# Tension sensor.

## Abstract
A tension sensor senses tension in magnetic tape by measuring the variation in inductance value which arises as a result of applying stress, transformed from tension in the ob ject to be measured, to an amorphous magnetic alloy part of an inductance element. The amorphous magnetic alloy is resi lient and magnetostrictive and is in the form of a thin strip 11 which is bent to form at least a part of the magnetic core. A pick off coil 12 is used to pick off induced voltage indicative of changes in tension in the strip 11 caused by movement of the strip 11 due to changes in tension of a magnetic tape 16.
