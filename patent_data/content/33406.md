## Description
APPARATUS FOR USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH BOILER PTA1 rES FOR GENERATING INERT BLANKETING GASESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention lies in the field of inert gas gene rotors. More particularly, it concert an inert gas generator which utilizes the products of combustion from a furnace or other source, along with a supply of fuel and combustion air, to generate inert blanketing gas with a selected minimum flue of oxygen content. 2. Description of the Prior Art Rensval of flammable liquids from tanks, vessel molds and the like, where the vapor pressure of the liquid is less than atmospheric pressure, is typically accomplished by pump out of the liquid from its containment. In such gases, as the liquid is withdrawn, a volume of gas at least equal to the volume of the withdrawn liquid must flow into the containment space to avoid less than atmospheric pressure within the containment volume. If the entering gas is air, and in view of the flammable nature of the liquid, an explosive mixture of air and flammable vapor from the liquid is formed, and a great hazard exists. This hazard is particularly significant in marine transport of flammable liquids, particularly because the discharge of oils is accomplished in port. Also, because the oils discharged are flammable, regulations require that gases admitted to containing spaces for the oils be inert. That is, their oxygen content is limited to where dry air contains approximately 21 oxygen. At 4 02, there is not sufficient oxygen to create an explosive condition within the containment space, such as it may be. On shipboard, it would be possible to make use ofInert Gas Generators for supply of inert blanketing gases, but such gases, produced by carefully controlled combustion, demand large quantitites of fuel which is an expensive, as well as an energy wasteful practice. Simultaneously, it is required that there be certain fuel firing in the silip s boilers. However, because, with limited boiler firing, it is virtually impossible to prevent the presence of 8t 10 2 in the stack flue gases, it has not been possible to make use of the boiler stack flue gases for blanketing, such as discussed, as a supplement to blanketing gases as produced by inert gas generation at another point aboardship.Such use of boiler flue gases is, potentially, a big step toward fuels conservation in the provision of a required quantity of inert blanketing gases in avoidance of explosions as the cargo is moved to land based containment. It is the primary object of this invention to provide an inert gas generator for providing an inert blanketing gas, for safety in pump out of hydrocarbons or other flammable liquids from tanks. It is a still further object to provide an inert gas generator that can utilize, as a major part of its input, products of combustion which have higher than minimum oxygen content. These and other objects are realized, and the limitations of the prior art are overcome in this inventipn by providing a cylindrical vessel, with its axis vertical.Concentric with the vessel wall is an internal wall of lesser diameter made of refractory material, which defines a combustion chamber. There is an air plenum at the top of the.vessel, and means to atomize a liquid fuel in a spray of very fine droplets, downwardly inside of the refractory wall. Combustion air, and the products of previous combustion, are flowed into the combustion chamber, to burn the fuel. The downwardly flowing flame passes outwardly under the bottom edge of the combustion chamber, and up through an annular space between the refractory wall and the outer wall of the vessel. A circular manifold in the annular space provides a plurality of nozzles forming a downward spray of water, which washes and cools the pflowing hot gases of the flame, which pass upwardly in the annular space past a demister, and outwardly of the vessel to another device, which is t receive the blanketing gas. Liquid level control means are provided to maintain a fixed level of water in the bottom of the tank, by controlling the draining of this water. The flow of combustion air to the air plenum and the flow of fuel to the burner may be controlled in accordance with the percentage of oxygen measured in the outlet flow of gases from the vessel. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other objects and advantages of this invention and a better understanding of the principles and details of the invention will be evident from the following description taken in conjunction with the appended drawings, in which FIGURE 1 illustrates one embodiment of the invention. FIGURE 2 illustrates a slightly modified embodiment of the invention. FIGURES 3 and 4 illustrate cross sections taken across the planes 3 3 and 4 4, respectively, of FIGURE 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT This invention illustrates two systems which show how it is possible to make use of a significant. portion of boiler flue gases as a supplement to other gases, which are fuel produced, with correspondingly reduced fuel demand, for production of inert blanketing gases in quantities as may be required. While two separate systems are shown, they both function in similar manners to prevent the presence of more than tolerable 4 oxygen in the inert blanketing gases. In the burning of essentially all hydrocarbon fuel, and for release of 910 btu lower heat value LHV , air is the supply source for oxygen, and with it goes atmospheric nitrogen. The oxygen requirement for 910 btu LHV is 2 cubic feet, along with approximately 7.6 cubic feet of nitrogen. For each 910 btu s the products of combustion gases are 1 cubic foot of carbon dioxide, 2 cubic feet of water vapor, plus 7.6 cubic feet of nitrogen for a total of 10.6 cubic feet of oxygen free gases when only theoretical oxygen air is admitted to the burning space. But, for chemical reasons, it is typical to admit an excess of air to the burning space, and this results in oxygen presence in the evolved gases. The maximum oxygen content to be allowed for blanketing gases is 4 , and this represents 20 excess air. Therefore, the release of 910 btu s causes production of 1 CO2, 2 H20, 0.4 2 and 9.1 N2 or a total of 12,5 cubic feet of gases, which represents considerable volumetric improvement over the 10.6 cubic feet 910 btu s at theoretical stoich iometric conditions. In fuels burning it is considered typical for some oxygen to be present in the combustion gases evolved, and, in operation at design rating or close thereto controls can nicely maintain a preferred oxygen content. However, it is virtually imposs ible to maintain oxygen content of combustion gases at drastically reduced rating such as from 5 to 20 for complete burning of the fuel. Referring now to the drawings and, in particular, to FIGURE 1, there is illustrated one embodiment of the invention, which is designed to use the products of combustion, or flue gas, from a boiler, such as might be used on board a tanker, for example, where hydrocarbon oil is to be pumped out of the hold of the vessel and the space filled with an inert gas of oxygen content less than a certain minimum, such as 4E, for example. The apparatus is indicated generally by the numeral 10.It comprises a vessel of circular cross section and vertical axis, indicated generally by the numeral 14. The vessel has an outer wall 12 and a base 116. Coaxial with the outer wall, and of lesser diameter, is a refractory wall 28, which is supported co axial with the vessel and positioned near the top of the vessel. The refractory wall 28A, which forms the boundary of the combustion chamber, can be made in a single piece with a tapering to portion 30A, as shown in FIGURE 2, or can be made in two cylindrical pieces, one of larger diameter 28, and the other of slightly smaller diameter 30. A fuel pipe 18 and a fuel nozzle 20 are supplied with liquid fuel under pressure, over line 62, through a control valve 64, and line 66. The nozzle 20 is conventional, and is designed to atomize the liquid fuel, and to provide a downgoing conical spray 22 of fuel droplets coaxial with the refractory walls. Not shown is a means for igniting the fine droplets of liquid fuel, to provide a downwardly flowing flame 24, 26. Steam may be provided through line 92 ad controlled by valve 93, in order to provide the atomization of the liquid fuel, if necessary. A combustion air plenum 16 surrounds the burner tube 18 and nozzle 20 and is supplied with combustion air from a blower means 68 of conventional design. The blower is connected to the plenum 16 by means of a pipe 70, and air flows into the space 74 inside of the plenum in accordance with arrow 72. If desired, water may be sprayed, through means 78, supplied by pipe 79 inside of the pipe 70, through which the combustion air flows. A control mechanism 76 can be provided to control the flow rate of combustion air to provide the desired minimum value of free oxygen in the products of combustion of the inert gas generator. The steam boiler 32, having a flue gas conduit 34, is tapped to supply flue gas through pipe 36 in accordance with arrow 40. This flue gas from the boiler generally has an oxygen content considerably higher than the minimum value, such as 4 , which is desired for the inert gas, to ensure that the oxygen content will be below the lower explosive limit. The oxygen content of flue gases from a boiler may be as high as 10 or more and, consequently, this excess oxygen must be consumed in the process of burning the liquid fuel. The flue gas flows in accordance with arrow 40 from pipe 36 into a plenum space 38 surrounding the upper refractory wall 30 of the combustion chamber 14. The flue gas flows in accordance with arrows 44 and 42 into the flame space 24, where the excess oxygen is consumed, so that the products of combustion indicated by the arrows 26, which flow out of the bottom end 29 of the refractory wall 28, flow upwardly in accordance with arrows 48, 49, in the annular space between the refractory wall 28 and the wall 12 of the vessel. A ring manifold 88 has a plurality of nozzles 39 spaced around the bottom surface, spraying water downwardly, so as to continually wash, clean and cool the hot gases 26.The gas flow indicated by arrows 26 continue wvpwardly in accordance with arrows 48 where a demister 94, which closes off the annular space, removes excess liquid from the gases, which flow out in accordance with arrows 49 and 50, through pipe 52, to the tank or other device which is to be filled with this inert gas. The water to manifold 88 is supplied through a pipe 90 and valve 91. On board ship the water can, of course, be sea water, which is collected in the bottom of the vessel 80, and is maintained at a selected level, and in accordance with the liquid level control means 81 and 82 which are shown schematically, and which control a dump valve 84 in the pipe 86, permitting the water to flow in accordance with arrow 85, out of the bottom of the tank. The control of the combustion in the boiler 32 is a difficult one, particularly if the demand for steam is a variable, as is usually the case. Consequently, it is almost impossible to control the oxygen content of the flue gases 41 to the desired minimum. Thus, the oxygen percentage may vary widely in the gases 40, which arq flowed into the inert gas generator through the pipe 36. Thus, in order to provide the required minimum oxygen cqntent, control of the flow of supplementary combustion air 72 from the blower 68 must be carefully controlled. It is desirable, therefore, to provide a means for determining the oxygen concentration in the outlet gases 50, by withdrawing some of that gas through a pipe 54 to an oxygen measuring means 56. Such a device 56 would be a commercially available instrument and no detailed description is desired. Signals would be provided over output lines 58 and 60, for example, which would control independently the air controller 76 in the pipe 70, and also the liquid fuel control valve 64. Thus, knowing the percentage of oxygen in the outlet gas 50, the inlet combustion air and inlet fuel can be controlled to maintain that oxygen content at the lower level that is desired. Referring briefly now to FIGURES 3 and 4, there are shown two cross sections, taken respectively across the planes 3 3 and 4 4 of FIGURE 1. Corresponting numbers are used on FIGURES 3 and 4 to those used in FIGURE 1, and the drawings are self evident. FIGURE 3 is taken across a plane above the demister 94 and shows the demister and a cross section through the refractory wall 23, and the outlet pipe 86. FIGURE 4 shows the cross section through the refractory wall28 and the outlet water pipe 86. Also, it shows the ring manifold 88 which supplies the sprays of water. In FIGURE 1 it was shown that the inlet pipe 36 for the flue gas went to a separate plenum space 38 and thereafter flowed into the flame area 24 through openings in the refractory wall surrounding the combustion zone. Referring now to FIGURE 2, there is shown a variation of FIGURE 1, in which a single plenum 16 is provided and two pipes provide gases flowing into the plenum 16. Pipe 70, which comes from the blower 68, supplies the combustion air 72, which is controlled by the means 76. Then there is the pipe 36 carrying the flue gases 40, which, likewise, flow into the plenum, and from there both gases flow past the burner nozzles 20, through the open neck of the refractory wall 30A, and into the spray of liquid fuel 22 to provide combustion oxygen for the fuel, to provide the downgoing flame 24 as was explained in FIGURE 1. Thereafter, the process is identical to that shown in FIGURE 1 and no further explanation is required. Corresponding numbers are used to indicate corresponding parts. For some services, and for various reasons, it may be preferred to completely burn only as little as 65 of the carbon and hydrogen of the hydrocarbon fuel. There is difficulty in this less than stoichiometric fuels burning, and varied special means for production of stable, but partial burning must be provided. Also, in this invention, precise air volume control and precise fuel control are required, as well as an especially shaped burner refractory 28, 30 . These special provisions are necessary to cause the unburned carbon of the fuel to exist in the form of carbon monoxide, rather than as carbon, per se, and as a readilycombustible gas. If carbon, as such, should bur present in the combustion gases, there would be a smoking and sooting problem. In addition to precise air and fuel control, and special shape, as shown, it is also necessary to maintain, as closely as possible, full combustion temperature for a selected time period after burning is initiated. Provision for maintenance of this temperature within the selected combustion chamber volume is the refractory lining 28, 30, of the combustion chamber and prior to any water contact cooling, where the refractory resists combustion heat as well as insulating the combustion zone from a cooler zone. In this invention, the precise air control applies only to air which is supplied by the blower 68. This is true because a specific quantity of oxygen is required for the burning of the fuel, and air is the most significant oxygen supplier, but because the excess oxygen of the flue gas, as variously admitted to the combustion zone, is also a supplier of oxygen for fuel burning, and the 02scan constitute as much as 108 of the flue gas both the air supplied, and the flue gas provide the total quantity of oxygen, but the quantity of flue gas must vary as the boiler is firing controlled for generation of varying quantities of steam such as may be required, and the oxygen content of the flue gases may vary widely, but meanwhile the oxygen content of the inert gas 50 must not exceed 4 .Because of this, and if the oxygen content of 40 is quite great, it is necessary, in that condition, to restrict air delivery to such a degree that the zone downstream of the liquid fuel atomizer is 2 deficient in the system as shown in FIGURE 1. But, in the system such as inFIGURE 2, air control simply maintains not more than 4 2 in 50. However, both systems make use of flue gas for total volume of blanketing gases as at 50. When the zone downstream of 20 is 0 2 deficient, the unburned carbon is as CO and unburned hydrogen as H . BothCO, and H2 when at combustion temperature, will react and very rapidly combine with 02 from HO for production of C02 and H2 0 in 26. In FIGURE 2 the air plenum lt has a mixture of air and flue gas for total 02 supply. It is well known by those versed in the arts that a preferred maximum partialpressure of H2 0 in 16 greatly accelerates burning of fuels.Since the H2 0 content varies widely as atmospheric humidity changes in air, the element 78 is added for control of theH20 partial pressure within 74 to an optimum condition.Either finely atomized water, or water vapor, provide humidity control at 78. In FIGURE 2, the water vapor content of the flue gases 40 provides ample H20 partial pvres sure within 74, because 74 is a mixture of air and flue gas. The fuel oil burner 20 in both systems of FIGURES 1 and 2 must be capable of extremely fine atomization of the liquid oil fuel 62. Under some special conditions this degree of atomization is possible with pressure atomization.However, a preferred means for atomization of 62 is by the action of steam, or steam atomization. Steam atomization has been virtually universally adopted, but pressure atomization can be used. Inert gases 50, as they exit at 52, have been waterspray cooled to approximately 4600 F, partially cleaned, and demisted. it is typical to further treat 50 prior to use as blanketing gases, but this is by well known methods, and is outside the field of this invention. This invention has been described for convenience in terms of an inert gas generator, which would be used on board a tanker so that, as the liquid fuel is pumped from the tanks, the inert gas can be used to take up its space and to exclude air from the space being vacated in the tank. In such a case, sea water would be used for the spray that cools and washes the combustion gases. Also, because of the boilers available on the ship, it would be convenient to use the flue gases from a boiler to provide the major part of the inert gases and the liquid fuel and combustion air would then simply supplement the inert gases in the flue gas and serve to reduce the oxygen content to the required minimum value. In other applications the products of combustion could be taken from large internal combustion engines, for example, which might be available. Also, o .land, gaseous fuel could be used in place of liquid fuel, if desired.
