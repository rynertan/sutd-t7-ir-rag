## Description
BICYCLIC AMIDE KETAL DERIVATIVES The present invention relates to certain bicyclic amide ketals and derivatives thereof, which have been found to be useful additives for inclusion in functional fluids particularly hydraulic fluids as acid and water scavengers. The present invention also includes as one embodiment thereof certain of these bicyclic amide ketals containing hetero atom functionality that were previously unknown. In U. S. 4,277,354 to Brois et al., certain oil soluble 2 and or 8 alkyl substituted 1 aza 3,7 dioxabicyclot3.3.0 oct 5 yl methyl alcohols are disclosed that have particular utility as additives to functional fluids to prevent corrosion of copper. Ester derivatives thereof of related structure are disclosed inU.S. 4,017,406. Further alkylene glycol esters of these compounds are disclosed in U.S. 4,199,463. In U.S. 3,600,214 to Feinauer et al., certain 5 alkyl or 5 aryl 4,6 dioxa l azabicyclo 3 .3 .O octanes having utility as dyeing aids for synthetic fibers are disclosed. Functional fluids are often exposed to extreme operating conditions. Such fluids may have to withstand elevated temperatures or be subjected to alternating extremes of high and low temperatures while maintaining desirable fluid properties. In addition, many fluids are exposed to sources of chemical contamination.Especially detrimental may be acid contaminants and water, either of which may seriously degrade fluid performance or affect additional components in the fluid system causing corrosion or degradation of system parts and ultimately contribute to a failure of the fluid system. Even where structural failure may not be a problem, contamination may still be undesirable. For example, in a dielectric fluid, small quantities of water on the order of only a few parts per thousand may seriously degrade the fluid s dielectric properties. Accordingly, it is well recognized that nonaqueous functional fluids may require the presence of additives to modify or control the effects of contaminants, particularly water and acids, therein. Although numerous additives are currently known and employed, a continued need exists to provide new additives that are compatible with many varieties of fluids or to provide improved protection under various operating conditions. According to the present invention it has now been found that functional fluids may be protected from the adverse effects of water or acid contamination by addition thereto of an amount that is effective to reduce water or acid buildup therein of a bicylic amide ketal compound corresponding to the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is hydrogen or a substituent of up to 20 carbons selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl and inertly substituted derivatives thereof, and R each occurrence independently is a t i alkylene moiety optionally substituted with up to 4 RX groups where R is a substituent of up to 10 carbons selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, and inertly substituted derivatives thereof.By the term inert is meant substituents that do not react to form interfering products during use in functional fluids and that do not interfere with preparation or purification of such compounds The ability of the above compounds to prevent adverse effects caused by the presence of water or acids is believed to be due to their unique reactivity owing to the chemical structure thereof. The present compounds are capable of preparing hydrolysis products that remain uniquely compatible with the functional fluid instead of forming insoluble or volatile reaction products. As a further advantage, the compositions may be easily modified so as to alter the reactivity thereof thereby modifying the ability of the compounds to maintain extremely low water or acid levels in the functional fluid.As an example, extremely reactive compounds may reduce the water content of a fluid to levels such that increased uptake of moisture results upon exposure to atmospheric or other moisture sources, thereby resulting in rapid depletion of the water scavenger. Accordingly, fluids that are unlikely to come in contact with sources of moisture or acids during their lifetimes, such as dielectric fluids that are encapsulated in electrical devices, may well benefit from the use of highly reactive water scavengers. On the other hand, fluids that must bear continual exposure to humidified air or other sources of moisture, such as hydraulic brake fluids, would do well to employ less reactive compounds. Generally, the presence of substituents on the C2 3 alkylene moieties R forming therings of bicylic amide ketals tend to reduce the reactivity of the present compounds. Certain of the above defined compositions are also novel compositions of matter. Accordingly, the present invention additionally includes as one embodiment thereof novel bicyclic amide ketal derivatives corresponding to the formula EMI4.1 wherein R is a nitrile, acetal or ketal group A is Cm 10 alkylene and Rl is as previously defined. These novel cbmpounds have been found to be especially suited as additives to hydraulic fluids and other functional fluids, e.g., lubricants, dielectric fluids, cutting fluids, heat transfer fluids, etc., in order to scavenge water and acids. Functional fluids, particularly hydraulic fluids have been called upon to face ever more demanding service requirements in recent years. In particular, there is an increased need for hydraulic fluids that retain a long service life, as long as 10 years or more, with little or no degradation of performance.One standard generally required of modern hydraulic fluids is a wet boiling point, e.g., the boiling point of a humidified sample, of at least 3560F 1800C over the practical life of the system, erg., 10 years.Other criteria must also be met by the fluid, such as rubber compatibility, fluidity at lowered temperatures, low toxicity, noncorrosivity to metals, pH, lubricity, etc. Several recently developed modern hydraulic fluids have achieved satisfactory performance in many of the above areas. In particular, such fluids include cyano derivatives of cyclic ketals and acetals disclosed in U.S. 4,320,024 to R. L. Reierson et al. Additional examples include the well known silicon containing fluids such as poly dialkylsiloxane fluids and fluids comprised of diesters of polyglycol ethers, phosphate ester fluids, etc. In many of these and other high performance hydraulic fluids it has been discovered that a water compatibility agent or scavenger may be required in order to maintain desirable high wet boiling points for the above mentioned time period. In this regard, it is desirable that both the active scavenging agent and its hydrolysis products be soluble and otherwise nonreactive with remaining components of the hydraulic fluid and with additional components of commercial hydraulic fluids that may accidently be mixed with or added to the hydraulic system during its service life. Additionally, the scavenger and its reaction products should not upset the delicate balance of fluid properties and in particular, should be noncorrosive to the various metals such as iron, zinc, aluminum, brass and steel used in braking and other hydraulic systems, and maintain fluid viscosity, rubber compatibility, pr, lubricity and boiling points within specifications.Finally, the scavenger must be sufficiently and selectively reactive with water under typical brake fluid conditions of pE 7.0 11.5 in the presence, possibly, of amine and hydroxyl functional additives or components, that the water content of the fluid will be maintained sufficiently low to prevent boiling point degradation. At the same time, however, it is preferable that the fluid not be completely desiccated so as to enhance the rate of further absorption of moisture thereby more rapidly depleting the scavenger.Furthermore, it is desirable that the hydrolysis products not reversibly dehydrate thereby reforming the scavenger and water, particularly at elevated temperatures where the need for protection against vapor formation is greatest In addition, the scavenger and hydrolysis products must possess good thermal stability in order that they not degrade the fluid qualities upon exposure to elevated temperatures over prolonged time periods. Upon hydrolysis, the compounds employed in the present invention form one or two different products, a hydroxyalkylamideoran aminoalkyl ester. The pre of the reaction determines the predominant product formed.The hydrolysis is illustrated schematically as follows EMI7.1 In the presence of acid, the hydroxyalkylamino alkyl ester II is rapidly formed as the principal reaction product. Isomeric products may be prepared depending on the ether position at which acid cleavage occurs. Because amine functionality present in the acid hydrolysis product II may neutralize additional acid functionality, the present invented compounds are uniquely capable and effective acid scavengers for both strong and weak acids. When acid is not present, the principal hydrolysis reaction product is the di hydroxyalkyl substituted amide I . In the compositions, inert substituents on R or on R include nitrile, acetal, ketal, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, hydroxyalkyl, and hydroxy or alkoxy terminated poly alkyleneoxy. More particularly, acetal or ketal R substituents correspond to the formula EMI7.2 wherein R4 is hydrogen or a C1 10 alkyl group and each R1 independently is CHR2CH2O nR3r where R2 is hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl, R3 is C1 10 alkyl and n is a number greater than or equal to zero, or both Rl s may be joined together to form a C2 or C3 alkylene group. Preferred bicyclic amide ketal derivatives are 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivatives corresponding to the formula EMI8.1 wherein R and A are as previously defined and R l is hydrogen or a substituent of up to 10 carbons selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl and inertly substituted derivations thereof. Highly preferred 1 aza 4,6 dioxobicyclo 3.3.0 octane derivatives are those wherein one or both of R are hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl, most preferably methyl, andA is C2 C4 alkylene or C14 alkyl substituted derivatives thereof. Examples of suitable compounds are 5 2 cyanobutyl 3,7 dimethyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxobicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 3 cyanobutyl 3,7 dimethyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 4 cyanobutyl 3,7 dimethyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 2 cyanobutyl 3 methyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 3 cyanobutyl 3 methyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 4 cyanobutyl 3 methyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 3,3 dimethoxypropyl 3,7 dimethyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 3,3 dimethoxypropyl 3 methyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane 5 2 1,3 dioxolanyl ethyl 3,7 dimethyl l aza 4,6 dioxabicyclot3.3.0 octane 5 2 1,3 dioxolanyl ethyl 3 methyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane etc. The compounds employed according to the present invention may be prepared according to known techniques. For example, R Feinauer, Synthesis, 1, 16 1971 , described the reaction of oxazolines with epoxides to prepare 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octanes. The process may be used to react substituted oxazolines according to the following schematic illustration EMI9.1 wherein R and R are as previously defined. An alternative procedure adapted from that disclosed by the same reference and in addition byBurzin and Feinauer, Angew. Chemie, 85, 1055 1973 andDE 2,344,607, involves the reaction of a dialkanolamine with an amide acetal, amide thioacetal or nitrile. The procedure is illustrated as follows EMI9.2 where Q is an oxygen or sulfur moiety and R, and R are as previously defined. It has additionally been discovered that in place of the above described amide acetals, amide thioacetals or nitriles, it is possible to employ the corresponding bis hydroxyalkyl amide which under conditions of elevated temperature and reduced pressure has been found to dehydrate to form the desired bicyclic compound. The bis hydroxyalkyl amides may be prepared by the known reaction of a di hydroxyalkyl amine and an acid chloride, ester or anhydride. The procedure is illustrated by the following schematic diagram EMI10.1 wherein X is the remnant of the acid chloride, ester or anhydride and R and R are as previously defined. The use of reduced pressure is important to the success of this method of preparation. The skilled artisan will note that while in service, the desired hydrolysis reaction to remove water is the reverse of the above process. However, at other than reduced pressures, the above hydrolysis products are highly resistant to dehydration. The compounds of the invention may be employed as additives to a wide variety of functional fluids. Examples include hydraulic fluids, especially aprotic fluids, comprised of nitrile functional acetals or ketals disclosed, for example, in previously identified U.S. 4,320,024 esters of mono, di or polycarboxylic acids esters of carbonic or phosphoric acids poly alkylene glycols, glycol ethers or formal derivatives thereof poly alkylene glycol diethers and silicone fluids including siloxanes, polysiloxanes, etc. Additional examples of functional fluids for use according to the present invention include lubricating oils such as mineral oils and synthetic oils, heat transfer fluids, automatic transmission and other traction fluids, dielectric fluids, cutting fluids and the like. Addtional components of hydraulic fluids for use in combination with compounds according to the present invention are those known and used in conventional hydraulic fluids and disclosed, for example, in the above identified U.S. 4,320,024. The bicyclic amide ketals are employed in minor or major proportions, depending on the application intended for the resulting fluid and the desired degree of protection from water or acid contamination. Suitably from 1 percent to 90 percent based on total composition weight of the previously defined compounds may be added. Preferred are amounts from 1.5 percent to 50 percent by weight and most preferred are amounts from 2 percent to 25 percent by weight. The bicyclic amide ketals derivatives are blended with the additional components of the functional fluid in any manner, and may be added as part of an inhibitor package to newly formulated or existing functional fluids while in service.Example 1 5 3 cyanobutyl 3, 7 dimethyl l aza 4, 6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane Di 2 hydroxy l propyl amine 2070 g was weighed into a 5000 ml 5 necked round bottom flask equipped with a thermowell, overhead stirrer, glycol bubbler capped reflux condenser, pressure equalizing addition funnel, and needle by which means gas may be added to the liquor. The diisopropanolamine was melted under argon atmosphere and metallic sodium 7 g is added. Stirring was continued with heating to 1000C to react and dissolve the sodium about 45 min. .A commercially available mixture 1622 g comprising 1,3dicyanobutane 80 85 percent by weight and remainder comprising essentially 1,2 dicyanobutane was added dropwise over a 41 hour interval after which time the temperature was increased to 1250C 130aC while a gentle stream of argon was employed to sweep out ammonia. The reaction was followed by gas phase chromatography and terminated after 21 hours by neutralization with ethaneoic acid 18 g . The crude product was carefully distilled under vacuum through a 25 x 250 mm vacuum jacketed Vigreaux column to yield 1226 g of over 99 percent pure product, with a boiling point of 1100C 1130C at 0.1 torr 13.3 Pa . Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry showed the product to be primarily 5 3 cyanobutyl 3,7 dimethyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane along with minor amounts of the 5 2 cyanoDutyl isomer. Example 2 Hydrolysis The product prepared in Example 1 was dissolved in acetonitrile and combined with an equimolar amount of distilled water at room temperature and stirred by magnetic bar. The progress of the conversion from the amide ketal to the amide and ester products was followed qualitatively by infrared spectroscopy.In the presence of 0.54 weight percent monoisopropanolamine, a common brake fluid corrosion inhibitor and pH control additive, both amide 1620 1640 cm 1 and ester 1720 1730 cm 1 bands appeared within the first hour after the water addition. The amide band continued to increase but the ester band decreased as. the reaction continued.Example 3 Acid Hydrolysis An additional amount of the reaction product prepared according to Example 1 was combined with an equimolar amount of water as concentrated hydrochloric acid 30 mole percent hydrogen chloride and stirred.During the addition, the pH of the resulting solution did not decrease below 6.5. Analysis of the resulting mixture by infrared absorbance spectroscopy indicated the primary reaction products were the corresponding esters as evidenced by a broad absorption band at 1720 1730 cm 1. Example 4 Inherent Corrosion A further sample of the reaction product prepared according to Example 1 was humidified according to the procedure outlined in Federal Motor VehicleSafety Standard FMVSS No. 116, 49 CFR ¬µ511.116 1971 . The sample together with an additional unhumidified sample was tested for corrosion substantially according to the procedure of 49 CFR ¬µ511.116.

Even in the absence of corrosion and oxidation inhibitors, the fluid meets or exceeds the DOT 5 requirements of FederalMotor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116 excepting in dry equilibrium reflux boiling point.In addition, it is highly flowable even under extreme conditions of use.Example 12 Additional bicyclic amide ketals were prepared for testing of compatibility in various functional fluids. Accordingly, an alkyl substituted compound, 3,7 dimethyl 5 propyl 1 aza 4,6 dioxabicyclo 3.3.0 octane, was prepared by reaction of diisopropylamine and 1 butane nitrile according to the procedure of Example 1. The product was isolated and purified by distillation. Two test formulations were prepared by combining the compound with bis 2 2 2 methoxyethoxy ethoxy ethyl pentanedioate CH2 CH2 O O CH2CH2O 3CR3 2 and tributylphosphate Phosflex 4, available from Stauffer Chemical Company .The formulations contained 20 percent by weight of the bicyclic amide ketal. The test formulations as well as an unprotected sample of each dicarboxylic ester and phosphate ester base fluid were humidified by the method described in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety StandardNo. 116 excepting that the period for humidification was extended by 26 hours 93 hours total . The samples were heated to reflux temperature and the reflux boiling points wet determined. Results are contained inTable IV.
