# Weld wire from extruded nickel containing powder.

## Abstract
A method for directly fabricating weld wire utilizing pow der metallurgy techniques. Nickel containing powder, mixed into a slurry, is continuously extruded in an auger type extru sion press into rod. The rod is consolidated to densities grea ter than about 91 theoretical density for subsequent rough handling.
