## Description
2 PHENETHYL 5 t 3,4 METHYLENEDIOXY a HYDROXYBENZYL PYRROLIDINES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AND INTERMEDIATES THEREFOR This invention concerns 2 Ephenethyl 5 3.4 methylenedioxy a hydroxybenzyl py rrolidines which affect the cardiovascular system and which are particularly effective as antihypertensive agents. The invention is directed toward orally active. long lasting cardiovascular regulators of hypertension. The invention also concerns a method for regulating the cardiovascular system and managing hypertension, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of this invention as active ingredient Various physiological responses result from administering pharmaceuticals which affect the cardiovascular system regulating receptors. These responses may vary from vasodilation, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, bradycardia. positive or negative inotropic effect. Secondary effects such as bronchodilation or bronchoconstriction can also appear. The physiological response depends on the exact nature of the drug. Therefore, various members of the same general class of compounds may be used in the treatment of cardiac disorders such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia. and vasal congestion. U.S. Patent 4,342,692 and its EPO counterpart disclose a family of compounds which may be interpreted to be similar to the compounds of the current invention. The present invention is directed toward orally active, long lasting cardiovascular regulators. The compound of this invention have a strong antihypertensive activity. The antihypertensive activity of the compounds of this invention is best shown by their effect on the systolic blood pressure. The compounds of this invention decrease significantly the systolic blood presure without at the same time increasing heart rates.Moreover, the dosage which is needed to decrease systolic blood pressure is very low and the secondary, often undesirable, side effects are thus avoided. Thus, this invention offers the effective management of hypertension without submitting the treated subject to the undesirable secondary effects which would be unavoidable if large doses are needed. The invention herein relates to compounds of formula IEMI2.1 and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, including mixtures of, and individual, stereoisomers, such as cis erythro, cis threo, trans erythro and trans threo isomers of the compounds. These compounds are potent antihypertensive agents and are therefore useful as cardiovascular system regulators. These compounds of the invention may be prepared in as many as eight possible stereoisomeric forms, and may exist as these stereochemically pure forms as racemic mixtures containing both members of one enantomeric pair from the total of four such pairs or. as mixtures of some or all of the diasteromeric forms. The invention is intended to encompass all of these possibilities. Separation of diastereomers can, of course, be carried out by any standard separation technique, such as thin layer or high pressure liquid chromatography, or even, fractional crystallization. Each racemic diastereomer or enantiomeric pair may, if desired, be resolved into its optical antipodes by conventional resolution means for example by separation e.g. fractional crystallization of the diastereomeric salts formed by the reaction of these compounds with optically active acids. Exemplary of such optically active acids are the optically active forms of camphor lo sulfonic acid, 2 bromo camphor sulfonic acid, camphoric acid, menthoxyacetic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, diacetyltartaric acid, pyrrolidine 5carboxylic acid and the like. The separated pure diastereomeric salts may then be cleaved by standard means to afford the respective optical isomers of the compounds of Formula I.Definitions As used hereinafter Noble metal catalyst is a catalyst such as platinum on carbon, platinum oxide, palladium on carbon, or rhodium on carbon, but other noble metal catalysts suitable to effect catalytic reductions are also included. Protection or Protecting group refer to the protection of phenolic hydroxyl groups. A phenolic hydroxyl group is present in many compounds prepared by the process of this invention. In order to preserve the phenolic hydroxyl group during the catalytic reduction, o protection is often required for phenols. which react readily with oxidizing agents, electrophiles, or even with mild alkylating and acylating agents.The protection of phenolic.hydroxyl groups can be achieved with any suitable protecting group such as an alkyl ether, for example methyl ether, isopropyl ether, t butyl ether alkoxymethyl ether. for example methoxymethyl ether alkoxyethoxymethyl ether, for example methoxyethoxymethyl ether cycloalkylmethyl ether, for example cyclopropylmethyl ether alkyldimethylsilyl ether, for example t butyldimethylsilyl ether, 9 anthrylmethyl ether, preferably substituted or unsubstituted benzyl ether.

I, II. III, or IV mean compounds as shown inTables 1 and 2. 24 previously trained adult male spontaneously hypertensive rats were distributed into 6 groups 5 animals per group with approximately equal mean systolic blood pressures. The 6 groups were then studied concurrently in a 2 day compound screening procedure. Test compounds were randomly assigned to each group. 5 groups received potential antihypertensive agents and 1 control group received vehicle only water and Tween . At approximately 17 hours prior to the first day of dosing food was removed from the rat cages. On the morning of Day 1, a group of 4 rats was orally dosed by gavage with 12.5 mg kg or 25 mg kg of cis erythro 2 phenethyl S C3,4 methylenedioxy i x hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine I or other tested compound dissolved suspended in water using 2 3 drops Tween 80 with a homogenizer at concentrations such that 0.1 ml of solution was administered per 10 g of body weight. At 4 1 2 hours post dose, food was put back in the cages and the rats were allowed to eat for 2 1 2 hours, after which food was again removed. On the morning of Day 2, rats were orally dosed as described above. Immediately after dosing, the rats were put in restrainers and placed in a heated chamber C30 t 1.0 C for four hours.Normal feeding resumed at the end of the study on Day 2. Systolic blood pressure i.e., pressure at the appearance of the first pulse were recorded using photoelectric transducers. The coccygeal arteries of 3 rats in a horizontal group were simultaneously occluded by pump inflated tail cuffs that were automatically inflated to 300 mmHg and then deflated. A pressure curve and tail pulses were simultaneously monitored on an MFE recorder. Four consecutive at 30 second intervals traces were recorded for each rat in a given horizontal group at one, two, three and four hours post compound administration. Subsequent horizontal groups were automatically tested in the same manner. The mean systolic blood pressure SBP of each rat at each observation time was calculated. The SBP of the animals in each dose group were compared to the SBP of the animals in the control group vehicle only at each observation time using a one way analysis of variance test. A compound exhibiting pro.05 at any observation time was considered to exhibit significant antihypertensive activity. Compounds significantly decreasing blood pressure 20 mmHg or more from control values at all four observation times were considered worthy of further examination. In these instances heart rates were calculated and tested for significant change from control heart rate values using the two tailed test.

Table 1 illustrates the superiority of compound I cis erythro 2 Cphenethyl 5 C 3,4 methylenedioxy a hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine over compounds II cis erythro 2 tphenethyl 5 t3.4 dihydroxy hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine and III trans erythro 2 jphenethyl j 5 3,4 dihydroxy alpha hydroxybenzyl pyrolidine. Compound I significantly decreases systolic blood pressure without. at the same time, increasing the heart rate. Increasing the heart rate is an undesirable condition very often associated with decreasing of blood pressure. Compound II also significantly decreases systolic blood pressure. However, the decrease in systolic blood pressure caused by compound II is accompanied by very high increase in the heart rate. Increased heart beat persists during all four hours. Compound III also significantly decreases blood pressure although not as much and not as steadily as compound I. However, the decrease in systolic blood pressure caused by compound III is accompanied by significant increase in the heart beat during the first two hours after dosing.B. Table 2 summarizes the results obtained by testing two compounds, namely, icis erythro 2 phenethyl 5 3,4 methylenedioxy alpha hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine I and icis erythro 2 3,4 di methoxy phenethyl 5 3.4 methylenedioxy alpha hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine IV .

Compound I cis erythro 2 phenethyl 5 3.4 methylenedioxy a hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine and compound IV, cis erythro 2 3.4 dimethoxy phenethyl 5 3e4 methylenedioxy a hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidine were tested using the same antihypertensive test as described above. Only half of the dose used in Table 1.i.e., 12.5 mg kg dosage was used. Compound I shows, even at the low dosage of 12,5 mg kg. a very strong blood pressure lowering effect which lasts more than eight hours following the single dosage. From the second hour until the eighth hour the decrease in systolic blood pressure is significant.Although some increase in the heart rate was observed during the first two hours. this increase was not significant and it quickly normalized. During the third and fourth hour, the heartbeat actually decreased and from 4 12 hours the heartbeat was close to normal. Compound IV. on the other hand had much less effect on lowering of the systolic blood pressure. Heart rates, while higher in absolute numbers than those of compound I, were also not significantly increased. Conclusion Among the four compounds tested compound I has the surprising and unexpectedly high effect on lowering of systolic blood pressure which is not accompanied simultaneously with the increase in the heart rate. The two other compounds II and III also show effect on lowering of systolic blood pressure. Both of them, however. at the same time. increase heart rates. Such increase is undesirable. It forces the heart to pulsate faster forcing the higher volumes of the blood into the peripheral circulation. More rapidly pulsating heart is susceptible to exhaustion and cardiac failure. Also, increased blood volume pumped more rapidly to the periphery can cause increased blood pressure by way of the feedback. Compound IV has only mild systolic blood pressure decreasing effect. At the same time, however, it slightly increases heart rates. Thus among the four compounds, compound I is the only compound which lowers the systolic blood pressure significantly and, at the same time, does not increase the heart rate. These two features make compound I desirable antihypertensive. EXAMPLE 25 Postural Hypotensive Effects of Cis Erythro 2 CPhenethyll 5 1 3,4 Methylenedioxy a Hydroxybenzyl ipyrrolidine This example illustrates postural hypotensive effect of compounds of this invention. Male normotensive Sprague Dawley rats CharlesRiver weighing 250 300 g were used. Surgery was conducted when tithe rats were under ether anesthesia. The left femoral artery and vein were cannulated for the measurement of blood pressure and for drug administration, respectively. The rats were secured on their backs to a special tilt table and allowed to recover from anesthesia. Animals were tilted from the horizontal to the head up vertical position 90 for 2 minutes twice at 15 minute intervals during the control period and at 15, 30, 45, 60 min. after drug administration. Compounds were prepared in water and were administered orally by gavage. Injection volume was 1 ml 100g. Each rat received only a single dose of a compound. The hypotensive response is the maximal mean blood pressure lowering induced by the drug with the animal in the supine position. The postural hypotensive effect is the maximal drop in MBP in response to tilting i.e., the net drop in BP in reference to that prior to tilt .Responses are expressed as absolute changes in mmHg. The results are shown in Figure 1. tCis erythro 2 lphenethyll 5 C 3,4 methylene dioxy alpha hydroxybenzyl pyrrolidie induced a dose dependent hypotensive response 1 100 mg kg. p.o. . At 10 mg kg p.o. , the compound lowered blood pressure 45 mmHg and at 100 mg kg p.o. , magnitude of 20 30 mmHg within the dose range tested. Thus, the compound I is, in a very small dose. very effective in lowering blood pressure in normotensive rats. This finding supports the results shown inExample 24 and the conclusion that Compound I is a desable antihypertensive. Toxic try The same compound of the invention as the hydrochloride salt was administered to five groups of five male mice at different doses per group, intravenously as an aqueous solution, and the mice observed for acute and delayed lethality. In this test the I.V. LD50 of the compound was 27 mg kg.
