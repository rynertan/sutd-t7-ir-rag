The zinc bromine electrochemical system of the invention may also feature a leak and impact resistant construction comprising The first electrolyte is generally the catholyte for the system, while the second electrolyte is generally the anolyte. The bromine rich phase is preferably a non aqueous phase which separates from the aqueous catholyte and contains bromine complexing agents. The compartment and casing materials are generally preferably comprised of chemically inert, impact resistant plastics. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cost efficient electrochemical apparatus It is another object of this invention to provide an electrochemical apparatus which is light weight and compact It is a further object of the invention to provide a new electrochemical system having a high voltage and cyclic life. These and other objects of this invention will be better understood and will become more apparent with reference to the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Referring to Figure 1, a schematic diagram of a typical circulating, bipolar zinc bromine system is shown. This system can be used in the inventive apparatus which will be hereinafter described with reference to Figures 2 to 7. The zinc bromine system of Figure 1 comprises two electrolytes which are circulated through separate compartments 8, 9 respectively, of the cell 10. An anolyte which is generally stored in reservoir 11 is pumped via pump 12 through compartment 8 and loop 13, generally referred to as the anode loop. A catholyte which is generally stored in reservoir 14, is pumped via pump 15 through compartment 9 and loop 16, generally referred to as the cathode loop. The zinc bromine system is also a two phase system, in that the catholyte has bromine complexing agents and is comprised of a first aqueous phase and a second, non aqueous, bromine rich phase. The bromine rich complexed phase tends to separate at the bromine active electrode 17 from the aqueous catholyte. This non aqueous phase is stored in the reservoir 14, as illustrated schematically by shaded portion 14a. A separator 18 delinates and defines the boundary between the anolyte and cathode compartments 8 and 9, respectively. The separator 18 is a membrane which prevents or hinders movement of anions such as the bromide and tribromide ions from cathode compartment 9 to the anode compartment 8. In a bipolar design, the zinc active electrode 19 and the bromine active electrode 17 are opposite sides of the same electrode structure. Further description of the zinc bromine system can be obtained with reference to aforementioned US A 4,105,829 issued August 8, 1978. The zinc bromine system can be made more practicable by integrating and improving various components of Figure 1, as will be hereinafter explained with respect to the inventive apparatus shown in Figures 2 to 7. Where applicable within the description, like components may have similar numerical designations for the sake of brevity. Now referring to Figure 2, an improved electrochemical apparatus is shown in a schematic perspective view. The improved apparatus utilises an integrated two leaved separator spacer and electrode forming a portion of a stack of cells, as depicted in the exploded view of Figure 3. The electrochemical apparatus of Figure 2, comprises a battery stack 25 which in turn is comprised of a plurality of cells 10, each having two plates, as shown in Figure 3. One plate, according to the invention is an integral separator spacer 28 as described in EP A 0203656 an electrode sheet 29 as described in EP A 0066938 spacer has two functions combined in a single sheet. The first purpose is that of the separator 18 in figure 1, i.e. to provide fluid communication between compartments as a membrane. A more detailed description of this function can be obtained from the above mentioned US A 4,105,829 issued August 8, 1978 and also from US A 4,259,417 issued March 31, 1981 for an Ionic Barrier , to inventors R. J. Bellows and P. G. Grimes. The second function of sheet 28 is to space the sheet 28 from the adjacent electrode sheets 29 so as to create respective anolyte and catholyte compartments 8 and 9 Figure 1 . The separator spacer sheet 28 has a microporous mid portion surface 30 which is recessed from the non porous surface 31 of the sides, as shown in more detail in Figures 6 and 6a. When the separator spacer sheets 28 are pressed between electrode sheets 29, the stack structure 25 is formed, as shown in Figure 2. The projections 32 on the microporous mid portion surfaces are designed to maintain a spaced compartmental distance between the separator spacer surface 30 and the flat conductive surfaces 33 of adjacent electrode sheet 29. The projections 32 provide structural means against collapse of surfaces 33 upon surfaces 30 and vice versa. The projections 32 on one side 30 of sheet 28 are diametrically opposite corresponding projections 32 on the opposite side 30 of sheet 28 as clearly illustrated in Figure 6a. This is done, to provide a greater strength against distortion of surfaces 33 upon surfaces 30. The projections 32 usually are designed as pebbles as depicted by arrows 32a in Figure 6a, and as also shown in Figures 7cc and 7dd, etc. These projections 32 may also be designed with a rod shape as depicted in Figures 7a, 7aa and 7b, 7bb by arrows 32b. The projections 32 may also be a combination of pebble and rod shaped protuberances as depicted in Figures 7c, 7cc and 7d, 7dd. The design of these projections allow for an expeditious flow of electrolyte through the compartments 8 and 9, respectively. The flow of electrolyte is accomplished without entrapping gas bubbles about projections 32 within the compartmental cavities 8 and 9. The mid portion of the separator spacer sheet 28 can be comprised of a microporous membrane material known as Daramic Sheets 28 and 29 are assembled by means of hollow male female connectors 40 shown in detail in Figures 6 and 6a. When the sheets 28 and 29 are assembled in a stack 25, these hollow connectors 40 form electrolyte manifolds which supply compartments 8 and 9 with electrolyte via individual conduits or channels 60. The male female connectors 40 of sheets 28 fit through the holes 41 Figures 4 and 4a in adjacent sheets 29, and snap into mating connectors 40 in subsequently adjacent sheets 28. The electrode sheet 29 of Figures 4 and 4a is comprised of a coextruded sheet of plastic which has an electrically conductive mid portion 33 and two side portions 37 of electrically non conductive insulating plastic. The top and bottom side portions 37 are coextruded side by side along with the mid portion 33 to form a one piece continuous electrode sheet, which continuous sheet is then cut to specific lengths to form a plurality of smaller sheets 29. The edges 38 of sheet 29 are undercut as shown to improve electrical isolation in stack 25. This side by side profile co extrusion of insulating and conductive plastic sheets 37 and 33, respectively, presents a new and an alternative fast method of production for all monopolar and bipolar electrodes including electrodes for zinc bromine batteries. Compared with compression molding, the co extrusion method gives more uniformity in thickness, a stronger bonding between the insulating and conductive plastics, much desired flatness, and electrode by yards similar to dress fabrics. The fabrication cost is much lower because the process is continuous. A special formulation of carbon plastic is needed for mid portion 33 of sheet 29 to provide good electrical conductivity, which still exhibit good extrudibility, good strength, and excellent anti corrosive properties against bromine and zinc bromide in the electrolyte. The preferred composition of the conductive carbon plastic is covered by aforementioned US A 4,169,816 issued October 2, 1979, to H.C. Tsien. This formulation gives good conductivity 1 to 2 ohm cm in resistivity , good flex strength, low permeability inertness to bromine, good extrudibility, better weldability and less mold shrinkage. The conductive plastic is a mixture of 100 parts by weight of polyolefin copolymer, 25 parts by weight of special conductive carbon, 5 parts by weight each of carbon fiber and glass fiber, and 1 part by weight of fumed silica powder. Some of the other advantages of coextruding the section 33 and 37 are Figures 5a, 5b and 5c are respective top, front and side views of an extrusion die used to fabricate the electrode sheet. The center extrusion die 47 receives conductive plastic from a horizontal extruder through conduit 46, while the side extrusion dies 48, each receive non conducting plastic from an overhead, vertical extruder via conduits 45a and 45b, respectively. The horizontal extruder for the black conductive plastic is a 2 1 2 6.35cm screw with L D of 30 1, while the vertical extruder for the opaque insulating plastic is a 1 1 2 3.81 cm dia. screw with L D of 24 1. The melted insulating plastic enters into the die at 90 degrees from the vertical stream 45, divides into two steams 45a and 45b and flows into one left and one right separate coat hangers along side the main coat hanger 45. The die design is conventional, except that the side by side profile division is believed to be novel. The die is of split construction in order to facilitate any changes in the design and the ease of fabrication. The main die assembly consists of a lower die body 55, upper die body 56, flexible upper lip 57 and fixed lower lip 58. The die lip gap is ground to allow for the swell of plastics emerging out of the die. Lip gaps can be individually adjusted by screws 59 in conjunction with the nut bars 61. The two side plastics 62 and 63 close the two outsides of flow channels of the insulating plastics and give a box like reinforcement. Adapter 64 provides connection to the main extruder. There are 16 cartridge heaters 65 and 4 band heaters 66 for heating the two streams of plastics. Temperatures are controlled through thermocouples and individual zone temperature controllers. The individual adjustment of the left and right streams 45a and 45b is made possible by ball headed adjusting screws 67 and locknut 68. Bushings 74 make good connection from valve blocks 75 to die block 56. All main parts of the die are made of A2 air hardening tool steel. The Bethelehem A2 air hardening steel has the following physical properties With the head pressures from the extruders well over 1000 psi 6.895 MPa , the die cannot operate free from internal leakage between the insulating and conducting streams if the die is in the soft annealed condition. The hardened and reground die eliminates internal leakage. Four different types of insulating plastics were tried, they are Both Exxon homopolymer PP5011 and 5052 can match well with the conductive plastic. They came out of the die with no wrinkles, the sheets were flat and uniform. Theoretically, aside from previous considerations, any polyethylene or polypropylene for side portions 37 can be a good match with the conductive plastic mid portion 33, because the basic material used in the conductive plastic is the copolymer of the two. The melting points are in the range of 325 to 375 F 162.8 to 190.6 C . Therefore, approximately 400 F 204.4 C is a proper temperature in range for the two streams to meet. Head pressures are 1500 to 1800 psi 10.34 to 12.41 MPa . These conditions made a good bond at the bonding line. Close match of melt indices is necessary in order to eliminate scallops formed at the joint of the two edges. The viscosities and velocities of the streams from the two extruders has to be very closely equal. Pressures can be manipulated from two heads while varying the temperatures in various die zones to get the matching conditions. However, the differences between melt flow index of conductive and that of insulating plastics has to be minimized. The extrusion speed can be around 20 ft. minute 6.096 m minute to 90 ft. minute 27.432 m minute . There are many downstream attachments that can be added so that the co extruded sheet can be worked on while still hot and soft. Thus, the repeated heating and cooling cycles with the accompanied plastic degradations can be eliminated. Powder of activated carbon can be sprayed on one face of the carbon plastic as the sheet is emerging from the die and before the sheet is pinched by the cold nip rolls. The powder spray is limited in the conductive area. Various types of surface finishes can be obtained by changing the nip rolls from polished chrome plated surface to Teflon coated and rubber rolls. It is also possible to replace nip rolls with dimpling rolls, so that cavities or special flow patterns can be formed on one or both faces of the co extruded sheet. The hot forming rolls can make repeated patterns of design indentations in the electrode, if so desired. The combination possibilities are only limited by imagination. For dimpling, the design is also repeated every revolution of the dimpling rolls. It is very much like printing repeated patterns on textile fabric. These downstream modifications such as catalyst spraying, dimpling, or hot forming can be added so that all operations can be done without significant added production cost. Figure 5 is a schematic perspective view of the continuous electrode sheet emerging from the split die illustrated in Figures 5a, 5b and 5c. Now referring to Figure 2, a further safety feature for the electrochemical system is illustrated. In order to prevent or reduce the risk of spilling corrosive bromine and bromine compounds in the event of casing or compartmental rupture, the various compartments can be nested with the bromine containing compartment 50 being the most internal compartment. The bromine compartment 50 is surrounded by the catholyte containing compartment 51, which in turn is surrounded by the anolyte containing compartment 52. Compartments 50, 51, and 52 are all enclosed by outer casing 53. Shunt currents can be eliminated along formed manifolds connectors 40 by means of applying a protective current along these electrolyte carrying conduits, in accordance with the teachings expressed in aforementioned US A 4,197,169 issued April 8, 1980 to M. Zahn, P. G. Grimes and R. J. Bellows. The two leaved electrochemical cell construction of this invention reduces parts and is easier to fabricate and assemble than prior systems of this kind. Further modifications to the invention may occur to those skilled practitioners of this art. Such modifications have not been described for the sake of brevity. Other preferred features of the invention, which features may be taken individually or in combination, are
