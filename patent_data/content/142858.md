# Method of producing monolithic catalyst for purification of exhaust gas.

## Abstract
A method of producing a monolithic three way catalyst for the purification of exhaust gases of internal combustion engines. First, a mixed oxide coating is provided to a mono lithic carrier by treating the carrier with a coating slip in which an active alumina powder containing cerium in oxide form is dispersed together with a ceria powder and then baking the treated carrier. Next, Pt, Rh and or Pd are deposited on the oxide coating by a known thermal decomposition process. The addition of the ceria powder to the coating slip is effective in enhancing the CO, HC and NO
