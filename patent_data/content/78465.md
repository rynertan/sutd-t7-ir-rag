# Fluorocarbon polymer gasket and method of manufacturing such.

## Abstract
A fluorocarbon polymer gasket is disclosed which has been compression formed from a fluorocarbon polymer sheet heated to its gel state cooled in its compressed state, and shaped into a gasket. The gasket so manufactured has a living memory thus enabling it to tend to return to its pre compression form when exposed to elevated tem peratures.
