# A process for preparing 2 beta D ribofuranosylselenazole 4 carboxamide.

## Abstract
A chemical process for preparing 2 β D ribofuranosylse lenazole 4 carboxamide, comprises the steps of a reacting 2,3,5 tri O benzoyl β D ribofuranosyl 1 carboni trile with gaseous hydrogen selenide, preferably in a 1 1 to 1 1.5 molar ratio, at a temperature and for a period suffi cient to effect conversion of said 2,3,5 tri O benzoyl β D ribofuranosyl 1 carbonitrile to 2,5 anhydro 3,4,6 tri O benzoyl β D allonselenocarboxamide b reacting said 2,5 anhydro 3,4,6 tri O benzoyl β D allon selenocarboxamide with ethyl bromopyruvate to produce ethyl 2 2,3,5 tri O benzoyl β D ribofuranosyl selenaz ole 4 carboxylate and c thereafter converting said ethyl 2 2,3,5 tri O benzoyl β B ribofuranosyl selenazole 4 carboxylate to 2 β D ribo furanosylselenazole 4 carboxamide.
