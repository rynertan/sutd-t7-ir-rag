# METHOD OF MAKING MODIFIED POLYIMIDE FOAMS

## Abstract
A method of making a resilient, flame resistant modified polyimide foam comprises a mixing an aromatic dianhydride component A with at least one lactam and or amino acid component B in a mole ratio of A B of from 1 1.5 to 1 0.05, b mixing an alcohol with the mixture from step a and heating the resulting mixture to form an esterified N substituted imide, c mixing at least one diamine component C with the product of step b , d drying the resulting mixture, and e polymerising the resulting solid at a temperature of from 120 to 320 C to give a modified polyimide foam.
