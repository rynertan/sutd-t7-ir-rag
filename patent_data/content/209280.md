## Description
ANTI VIBRATION MOUNT The present invention relates to an anti vibration mount. Anti vibration mounts are commonly used for the mounting of vibration creating machinery onto static supports. Various types of anti vibration mounts have been proposed in the past and generally they incorporate a resilient material such as an elastomer for isolating the machinery to be mounted from the support. In such arrangements the resilient material is usually bonded to other parts of the mount in order to provide a unitary unit. During use, it is a common occurrance for the bonding to fail resulting in separation of the resilient material from the component to which it was bonded. Such separation usually results in the mount losing its ability to perform as a vibration isolator and in certain designs results in separation of the machinery from the support. It is a general aim of the present invention to provide an anti vibration mount which uses an elastomeric material which is not bonded to adjacent components. It is an additional aim of the present invention to provide a mount which retains unitary integrity should the elastomeric material disintegrate. According to the present invention there is provided an anti vibration mount including a first conical seat for attachment to a structure to be mounted and a second conical seat for attachment to a support structure, a unitary annular member located between the first and second seats, the annular member comprising a plurality of resiliently deformable balls joined to one another. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a siae view of a mount according to the present invention Figure 2 is an axial section of the mount shown inFigure 1 taken along line II II Figure 3 is a sectional view of the mount shown inFigure 2 taken along line III III and Figure 4 is a graph illustrating a plot of natural frequency of a mount v static load. The mount 10 includes a lower conical seat 12 and an upper conical seat 14. Located between the upper and lower conical seats is a unitary annular member 13. The member 13 is preferably a one piece moulding formed from an elastomeric material having suitable resilient characteristics such as for instance natural rubber. The annular member 13 illustrated comprises a series of balls 15 which are closely spaced and joined at their peripheries to one another by a connection portion 15a.The connection portion 15a between each pair of balls 15 is preferably located concentrically with the point of peripheral contact between the pair of balls. In Figure 3, the annular member 13 is shown as comprising 5 balls but it will be appreciated that the annular member can comprise more or less than 5 balls.The annular member 13 is merely seated between the upper and lower conical seats and is not secured to either seat. The lower seat 12 is conveniently a metal pressing and is provided with an outwardly directed flange 18.The upper seat 14 is secured to a housing 20 which includes an inwardly directed flange 22. Flanges 18 and 22 overlap and thereby co operate with one another to prevent separation of the upper and lower seats.Accordingly the mount is a unitary assembly which is capable of retaining unitary integrity even should the annular member disintegrate. The flanges 18 and 22 also co operate to hold the balls 15 under a predetermined loading so that they are retained in a compressed state. The flange 22 is formed during assembly by inwardly turning the terminal marginal portion of a band 23 which forms part of the housing 20. The upper seat 14 is provided with attachment means for attaching the upper seat to the machinery or structure to be mounted. In the illustrated embodiment the attachment means is in the form of a screw threaded shaft 26. The lower seat 12 is similarly provided with attachment means in the form of a screw threaded shaft 30 for attaching the lower seat to the support structure not shown . It will be appreciated that alternative types of attachment means for the upper and lower seat may be provided if desired. In use, the annular member 13 acts as a bracelet of individual balls 15 which are able to roll relative to the upper and lower conical seats. The resilience of the balls 15 acts upon the conical seats 12, 14 to bias them to a co axial position. Forces applied to one of the seats from any direction causes compression of some or all of the balls which resist the applied force in a progressive manner, i.e. the greater the deflection the greater the resistance to the deflection to provide the desired anti vibration characteristics. During compression the balls roll relative to the conical seats and are deformed to accommodate adjacent spaces surrounding the balls. The central portions 15a provide relatively little resistance to twisting forces and so adjacent bails are able to roll relative to one another and in the confines of the mount act as individual balls.However, since all the balls are joined together by the central r ion l5a it is not possible for any one of the balls to become neorrec ly ositione relative to the other U The ability of the morit of the present invention to progressively resist deflection as mentioned above provides greater flexibility of use applications for tne mount. For instance, if reference is made to the graph depicted in Figure 4 a natural frequency V static load plot is shown in a solid line of a mount having five balls of an elastomeric material having a shore hardness of 60 65. When mounting a machine on a structure, it is important that all the mounts have approximately the same natural frequency. Since the natural frequency of a mount is altered by the applied weight, in the past it has been necessary to calculate at the mounting locations the applied weight acting at that location and choose a mount capable of supporting that applied weight and have the desired natural frequency. As can be seen from the plot shown in Figure 4, the present mount is capable of producing a natural frequency of between 6 to 8 Hz for applied loads varying between 0.5 to 3.2 kN i.e. for a range of 2.7 kN. For comparison purposes a mount having a constant resistance to deflection is plotted dotted line and it will be seen that for this mount to retain a natural frequency between 6 to 8 Hz the applied load can only vary between 1.15 kN to 1.95 kN i.e. for a range of 0.8 kN. It will be appreciated therefore that a machine or structure to be supported can be mounted by several identical mounts of the present invention without the need to use different mounts at different locations.
