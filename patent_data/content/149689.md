## Description
MODULAR ASSEMBLY ELEMENT STRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY FOR ERECTING PARTITION WALLS AND THE LIKE This invention relates to a modular assembly element structure, particularly for erecting partition walls and the like. As is known, various types of modular assembly elements have long been available on the market for erecting partition walls and the like such prior modular elements, however, have the disadvantage that their assembling procedure is relatively complex, as well as time consuming when interconnecting the various elements to produce a thick wall. Another disadvantage of prior modular elements is that their assembling involves the availability of specialized labor in considerable number, which has unavoidably a significant adverse effect on costs. It is an object of this invention to obviate such prior disadvantages by providing a modular assembly element structure, which is expressedly designed for erecting partition walls and the like and has the peculiar characteristic of a very simple construction enabling such elements to be assembled by simply matching them together and superimpostng the modular elements to one another in an offset relationship, thus making a wall of a desired size. A further object of the invention is to provide a modular assembly element structure which, in addition to being of a high aesthetic quality, is designed to result in an article of manufacture having high strength characteristics and requiring no complex or expensive anchoring arrangements for securing the wall itself. another object of this invention is to provide modular assembly elements which can be joined to one another and mutually associated in a stable and reliable manner, while allowing, when necessary, said elements to be quickly taken apart for subsequent reuse. A not unimportant object of this invention is to provide modular assembly elements which may be readily formed from commercially available elements and materials, and are highly competitive from the purely economical standpoint. These and other objects, such as will become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a modular assembly element structure particularly for erecting partition walls and the like, according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises a body Ci of sabstantially parallelepipedal configuration defining, on the top 2 and bottom 4 faces thereof, respectively, male interlocking elements 3 and female interlocking elements 5 , and at the ends thereof male 6 and female 7 coupling elements, for respective engagement with superimposed bodies and bodies laid side by side, there being further provided a pair of through holes 10 extending between said top 2 and bottom 4 faces at a center to center distance which is substantially equal to one half the length of said body 1 . Further features and advantages will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description of this modular assembly element structure, with reference to the accompanying illustrative and not limitative drawings, where Figure 1 is a schematical perspective view of the modular elements according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective bottom view of a modular element Figure 3 shows several modular elements arranged side by side, in top plan view Figure 4 illustrates schematically the configuration of a wall obtained by joining together two modular elements Figure 5 is a sectional view taken along the line V V of Figure 4 and Figure 6 is a cut away view of the stable fastening means used between modular elements. waking reference to the drawing views, the modular assembly element structure particularly for erecting partition walls and the like, according to this invention, comprises a body, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, which is preferably, but not necessarily, made of wood and has a substantially parallelepipedal elongate configuration. The body 1 defines, at its top face 2, a male interlocking element comprising a protuberance 3 which extends longitudinally on the face 2. Provided correspondingly on the bottom face 4 is a middle recess 5 extending longitudinally. The body 1 is provided at its ends with male coupling elements comprising a projection 6, and correspondingly at its other end, with female coupling elements comprising a recess 7 and being defined at the same middle region containing the male and female interlocking elements 3 and 5. The male and female interlocking elements 3 and 5 allow, similarly to the male and female coupling elements 6 and 7, mutual interlocking of the superimposed and side by side bodies 1 more specifically, one body 1 would interlock with bodies 1 laid side by side and bodies 1 laid over and under it. To make more stable the coupling at the middle region presenting the male and female interlocking elements 3 and 5, a pair of through holes 10 are defined which extend vertically through the body 7 from its top face 2 to its face 4, which holes present center to center distances which are substantially equal to one half the useful length of the body 1 and such that each through hole 10 is pitch laid, i.e. at the same center to center distance as the hole 10 in the side by side elements. With this arrangement, to erect a wall, the bodies 1 may be stacked together offset by a half length relatively to the underlying bodies 1. The bodies 1 s. arranged are joined to one another by means of vertical bars 20 which are inserted through the holes 10 in the various superimposed bodies which, on account of the positioning just described, will be all aligned.Where a firmer mutual connection is required between the various bodies, a throughgolng channel 11 would be provided in a middle portion between each pair of holes 10, said channel 11 comprising, at the bottom, a narrow region 12 for engagement with a fastening screw 15 which may be practically tightened onto the underlying body 7 and has its head practically in abutment relationship with the start of the narrow region. It should be added to the foregoing that provided on the front faces of the bodies 1, on two adjoining sides, is a cutout 30 which creates in practice a decorative design enhancing the Joint between the various bodies t. To form the vertical edges of a wall or partition wall, there are provided end bodies which are half as long as the bodies 1, thereby the vertical edges are practically closed flush similarly to these, base elements may be provided for starting the wall, as may top end tile panels which can have their top face smooth and finished without the male interlocking element. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular that the various bodies 1 can be assembled together in a most simple manner by merely bringing together and interlocking the various bodies 1, which will then be held together by means of the vertical bars 20, which defeat all possibilities for relative movement. Where a stabler connection is required, two bodies 1 can be firmly fastened to each other by means of screws 15 provided in a number that will depend on the type of connection to be obtained, it being unnecessary to secure all of the bodies 1 by means of screws. In practicing the invention, the materials used, although best results have been obtained when using wood, and the dimensions and contingent shapes may be any selected ones to meet individual requirements.
