# An improved overhead electric transmission or distribution system.

## Abstract
Risk of fracture of an optical fibre in an overhead stranded electric conductor 1 having an optical fibre loosely housed in an elongate compartment extending throughout the length of the conductor when the conductor is subjected to a tensile load greater than that which the optical fibre is designed to withstand is substantially reduced by supporting the stranded conductor from each of two opposite sides of a tower 2 by suspension means 3 incorporating a weak link 4 designed to fracture at a tensile load less than that which the optical fibre can withstand before fracturing. An excess length 6 of the stranded conductor extends between fittings 5 at which the suspension means 3 are secured to the conductor 1, is arranged sinuously down one side face of the tower and, where the standed conductor is an earth conduc tor, is detachably secured to the tower at spaced positions along its length by releasable clips 7. When the tensile load on the stranded conductor 1 increases to a value greater than that which the weak links 4 can withstand, a weak link will fracture and the excess length 6 of stranded conductor will be detached from the tower to reduce the load on the stranded conductor and thereby reduce risk of optical fibre fracture.
