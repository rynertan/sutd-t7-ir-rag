# Apparatus for automatically attaching terminals to cable ends.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for automatically attaching a ferrule to each end of a cable such as an optical fiber cable are proposed. The cable is cut into suitable lengths and coiled for easy handling. All the steps are done automati cally and the stripping and subsequent steps are done while the coiled cable loop laid down on a conveyor rack 21 is conveyed intermittently from one station I to VII to another.
