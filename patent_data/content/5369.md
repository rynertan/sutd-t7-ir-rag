# BAGS CONVERTIBLE FROM A HAND HELD FORM TO A SHOULDER SUPPORTED FORM

## Abstract
There is disclosed a bag convertible from a hand held form to a shoulder supported form. The bag comprises a bag body 10 and a carrier 12 in the form of a closed loop. The carrier includes a pair of handle segments 12a, 12b and a pair of flexible support segments 12c, 12d adjoining the handle segments 12a, 12b in alternating end to end relation. The support segments 12c, 12d are slidably carried by the bag body 10 for movement of the carrier 12 between a first position in which the handle segments 12a, 12b are retained in relatively close proximity to the bag body 10 and a second position in which the handle segments 12a, 12b may be extended upwardly from the first position.
