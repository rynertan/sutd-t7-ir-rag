## Description
STABILIZED POLYOLEFINS FILLED WITH TALC This invention relates to stabilized polyolefin compositions filled with tale having improved resistance to oxidative degradation, especially at elevated temperatur.es. Polyolefin compositions which are crystalline have found wide acceptance as moldable plastics and include low, medium and high density polyethylene, polypropylene and ethylene propylene crystalline copolymers containing up to about ten percent ethylene have been used to prepare many types of molded articles.These molded articles are generally unstable however when exposed to oxygen, particularly when exposed to oxygen in the presence of heat. This instability causes degradation of the polymer with a loss of physical properties of the molded article. Phenolic antioxidants have been added to the polyolefins to improve their oxidative stability or resistance to oxidative degradation. However, when the polyolefin compositions contain from 5 to 50 by weight of talc as a filler, the phenolic antioxidants de not provide adequate oxidative stability to the polyolefin compositions. In accordance with this invention the resistance to oxidative degradation of polyolefin compositions, particularly polypropylene compositions, con taining 5 tc 50 by weight talc and a phenolic antioxidant is improved by adding to the composition polyTDP which is a polyester heaving the repeating unitEMI1.1 wherein R is selected from the group of divalent radicals consisting of l,l cyclohexanedimethylene 1,2 cyclo hexanedimethylene 1,3 cyclohexanediethglene and 1,4 cyclohexanedimethylene said polyester being at least partially chain terminated with an alcohol selected from methanol ethanol butanol isobutanol 2 ethylhexanol 2,2 dimethylpentanol 2,2,4 trimethylpentanol and stearyl alcohol or an acid or anhydride selected from acetic, butyric, isobutyric, lauric, oleic, stearic, pelargonic and benzoic and said polyester having an average molecular weight of from about 500 to about 4000. The results obtained with these particular stabilizer combinations were unobvious and unexpected since each of these stabilizers when used alone in polyolefin filled with talc is not an effective oxidation stabilizer. The poly TDP possesses an unusual ability to protect polyolefin compositions filled with talc against deterioration due to oxygen and heat, and the protection is retained after severe aging, such as at 1500C. for several months. The preferred poly TDP is a polyester prepared from dimethyl 3,3 thiodipropionate, a diol such as 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol, and preferably capped with an alcohol such as stearyl alcohol or with acetic acid. The poly TDP can vary in average molecular weight from 500 to 4000, preferably from 1500 to 2500.This polyester is more fully described in U.S. Patents 3,590,056 and 3,466,323.

and tris 3 t butyl 4 hydroxy 5 methylbenzyl isocyanurate. The most preferred phenolic anitoxidants are tetrakis methylene 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyhydro cinnamate methane and tris 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl isocyanurate. These compounds are identified as I and II respectively in subsequent discussion and the poly TDP is identified as III. The amounts of phenolic antioxidant and polyTDP blended with the polyolefin can be varied independently from a very small stabilizing amount up to several percent. More specifically, beneficial results are obtained when the ratio by weight of I or II to III is in the range of 1 to 10 to 2 to 1, preferably from 1 to 5 to 1 to 1, and. the total stabilizer combination is from 0.1 percent to 10.0 percent by weight of the total weight of the polyolefin composition filled with talc, with the preferable concentration being from 0.2 percent te 3.0 percent of the formulation weight. If the stabilizer is used in an amount of less than 0.1 percent, the polyolefin composition does not possess the longer term stability preferred for many commerical applications.If the stabilizer is used in amounts greater than 5 to 10 percent by weight, tnstgniRicant stability is achieved by the excess stabilizer. Phenolic antioxidants, including tetrakis methylenet3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxyhydrocinnamate a methane, stabilize homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene and propylene against the adverse effects of heat and oxidation. However, these stabilizers and prior combinations thereof with other types of stabili zers, such as sulfur containing compounds and organophosphorous compounds, have proved to have limitations when used in polyolefin compositions filled with talc. This invention will be further illustrated by the following tabular examples although it will be understood that these examples are included merely for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The compositions of the following table were prepared by intimately blending in a mixer the heatsoftened polypropylene, e.g., of 0.90 specific gravity, and the various comminuted stabilizer components in the concentrations shown, granulating the blend and injection molding the same into 2 1 2 x 1 2 x 1 16 test specimens. The test specimens were then placed in a forced air oven at 1500C. and the times required for degradation, as monitored by surface appearance, thereof recorded. Table 1 gives the results.

The addition oS talc to polypropylene greatly reduces its ovenlife. The addiction of other stabilizers identified as Plastanox LTDP, 711, 1212 and STPP to formulations stabilized with stabilizers I or SI alone does little to increase the ovenlife of these formulations. However, the addition of Poly TDP 2000 average molecular weight with either I or II greetly increases the oven stability. This is a highly unexpected result. The stabilized polyolefin compositions can be molded into articles which are unexpectedly stable to oxidative degradation. Such articles include plates, bowls, toys, garbage cans, appliances such as vacuum cleaners, dishwashers, clothes dryers and. hairdryers, underhood automotive epplications, and coatings for various uses such as electrical wire coatings. Other additives, stabilizers, copper deactivators, pigments, dyes and the like can also be added to the present stabilized compositions.
