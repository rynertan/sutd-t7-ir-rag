# Method for depositing material with nanometer dimensions.

## Abstract
This method involves the deposition of free metal atoms 4 from the apex 5 of a pointed tip 1 supported at a distance of 10 to 20 nm from a substrate 2 . The atoms 4 are being fieid desorbed under the influence of a strong electric field existing between the tip 1 and the substrate 2 . With the tip 1 being moved across the substrate 2 , a narrow trave 6 of metal atoms will be deposited on the substrate.
