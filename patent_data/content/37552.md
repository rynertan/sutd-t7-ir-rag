# Signal synthesizer apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a signal synthesizer apparatus comprising a parameter dependent multiplier. The parameter dependent multiplier includes input means 90, 92 for storing an input charge Qin corresponding to an input signal Ein applied thereto transmission means 94, 104, 106 coupled to the input means 90, 92 for selectively transferring charges Qa Qd of the input charge Qin , the selectivity of the transmis sion means 94, 104, 106 being dependent on a prescribed parameter K or K intermediate means 96 for storing charges Qa Qd transferred from the transmission means 94, 104, 106 and output means 98, 100, 102 coupled to the intermediate means 96 for jointing the charge Qa Qd stored by the intermediate means 96 and providing an out put signal Eout corresponding to the jointed charge Î£Qi .
