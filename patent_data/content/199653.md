# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RAPIDLY STRIPPING CABLE WIRES AND CRIMPING CONTACTS THEREON

## Abstract
Wire stripping and crimping tools are combined in modules 10, 16 movable along parallel rails 18, 20 . An individual preparing a cable slides a particular tool module in front of a work station where each wire, requiring the same contact, is first stripped 62 then moved to an adjacent crimper 64 where a contact is crimped thereto. A second module carrying a second type of contact is then positioned into place and the cycle is repeated for those wires requiring fastening of the second type of contact thereto. By sequen tially moving different modules to the cable, the entire cable becomes dressed in situ.
