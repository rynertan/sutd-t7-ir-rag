# Antihypertensive agents and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
An aqueous extract product which is effective for prevention or treatment of hypertension is produced by concentrating an aqueous extract obtained by extracting water soluble components from vegetable oils such as soybean oil, corn oil, rapeseed oil and cotton seed oil adding a lower alcohol to the resulting extract to prepare an alcoholic solution having an alcohol concentration above 85 , thereby precipitating the insoluble matter then remov ing the precipitates and thereafter removing the alcohol. A powdered product having an antihypertensive activity is also produced by subjecting said aqueous extract product to an additional optional purification step and thereafter concen trating the resulting product to obtain a powder. An anti hypertensive agent containing a novel substance OSG as an effective component is also disclosed.
