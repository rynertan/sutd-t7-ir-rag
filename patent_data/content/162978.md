# Closed FCC cyclone catalyst separation method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The present invention involves an improved process and apparatus for the fluid catalytic cracking FCC of hydrocar bons. In such an invention, the output of a reactor riser zone is fed to a riser cyclone separator, a primary cyclone separator, and secondary cyclone separators, connected in series within a single reactor vessel. The riser cyclone separator is connected to the primary cyclone separator by a conduit, which prevents random post riser thermal cracking of the hydrocarbons after they exit the riser cyclone separ ator. The conduit contains an annular port to allow stripping gas to enter the conduit to improve the separation of hydrocarbons from catalyst. Catalyst separated in the riser cyclone separator can drop through a riser cyclone dipleg and can then pass through a dipleg seal which comprises a seal pot or catalyst held around the dipleg. The conduit is formed by two overlapping parts, one having a larger diameter than the other to form the annular port and packing or spacers may be used to align and space the overlapping parts.
