# Thermal recording system and method.

## Abstract
A closed loop thermal recording system and method are provided for recording a grey scale image on a transparency type of thermally sensitive recording medium in accordance with electronic image signals. The application of thermal energy to the medium is controlled, in part, by a feedback subsystem that optically monitors pixel area density while recording is in progress. The recording system includes a light reflective background member 15 , located between a transparent recording layer 14 of the medium 10 and a thermal print head 34 , for improving the accuracy and reliability of the optical monitoring process.
