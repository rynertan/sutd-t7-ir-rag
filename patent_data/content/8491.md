# Digital demodulator for phase shift keyed signals.

## Abstract
A digital demodulator for differential phase shift keyed DPSK signals 154 includes two pairs of 1 bit integrators 105, 106 and 107, 108 for continuously taking the phase difference between successive DPSK bits. Each DPSK bit is subdivided 100 into a plurality of bits, for example 15 bits. A weighted output signal having 4 bits is provided by each 1 bit integrator for each of the bits corresponding to a DPSK bit. The weighted output signals from each pair of 1 bit integ rators are sine weighted and multiplied 118 . The products are then added 120 together for application to a comparator 121 . The comparator 121 compares the sum of the addition to a predetermined reference signal and provides a demod ulated digital signal 155 having a logical state dependent on whether the sum is greater or smaller than the predetermined reference.
