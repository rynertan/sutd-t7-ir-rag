# Spool mounting apparatus and method of producing the same.

## Abstract
Cap members 7 8 are placed at the lower end of the perforated bottom spool sleeve 13 and at the top end of the perforated top spool sleeve of a series of package containing spools mounted at a perforated tube or sword 3 . The cap members prevent, during treatment of the package containing spools with a suitable treatment fluid or agent like, for example, a dyeing or bleaching fluid, the escape of such treatment fluid at each of the connecting locations between the perforated sleeve of the bottom spool and a base plate as well as between the perforated sleeve of the top spool and a chuck type or clamping closure member. The end portions of the perforated sleeves are constructed such that no treatment fluid can escape at the connecting locations between the perforated sleeves of adjacent spools in the series of package containing spools mounted at the associated perforated tube.
