## Description
The present invention relates to novel polycyclic fused pyrazole compounds, their use as anti inflammatory agents, and a method of preparation thereof. Typical glucocorticoid activity is rarely found in structures which do not possess an intact steroid nucleus. Such activity is found in naturally occurring steroids such as cortisone, hydrocortisone and aldosterone, as well as numerous synthetic modifications thereof, all containing the intact steroid nucleus. An example of a synthetic cortical steroid having high activity is a fluorophenylpyrazole derivative reported by Fried et al.,J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85, 236 1963 , having the structureEMI1.1 The present invention relates to compounds having the formula EMI2.1 where R is hydrogen or fluorine. A pharmaceutical composition for treating inflammation in mammals comprises an anti inflammatorily effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One can reduce inflammation in a mammal by administering to said mammal an antiinflammatorily effective amount of a compound of Formula I. One can prepare a compound of Formula I by reacting a compound of the formula EMI2.2 with 1,2,3 indantrione. The intermediates of Formula II are prepared from a known starting material, 5 ethenyl 4,4a,7,8 tetrahydro 4a methyl 2 3H naphthalenone U.S. Patent 4,157,349, in accordance with the following reactions EMI3.1 The trienone starting material is reacted with methyl formate in the presence of sodium methoxide in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran to afford 5 ethenyl3 hydroxymethylene 4,4a,7,8 tetrahydro 4a methyl 2 3H naphthalenone, and the latter is then reacted with phenylhydrazine or 4 fluorophenylhydrazine or an acidaddition salt thereof in the presence of acetic acid to give the compound of Formula II. The reaction of a compound of Formula II with 1,2,3 indantrione takes place by heating the reactants in an inert solvent at a temperature between about 500 and 1500C. The compounds of Formula I exhibit an endocrinological profile characteristic of compounds possessing glucocorticoid properties and systemic and or topical anti inflammatory activity cf. R.H. Silber. TheBiology of Anti inflammatory Steroids, Annals of the NewYork Academy of Sciences, Vol. 82, Art. 4, pp. 821 828. When the compounds of Formula I are administered orally to rats they cause a significant depression in thymus weight, adrenal weight and body weight gain without a change in food consumption. The compound of Formula I where R is F has also been found to possess oral glucocorticoid activity by the liver glycogen deposition test and anti inflammatory activity by the a tocopherol pouch test in rats. The test procedures used to determine the biological activities of the compounds of the invention were carried out as follows Endocrine Profile Mature female rats with an average body weight of 202 g and a body weight range of 15 g or less were medicated orally with test compound for 2 weeks. The test compound was prepared as a solution or suspension in 1 gum tragacanth or 0.75 methyl cellulose.On the day following the last medication, the rats were killed and the thymus and adrenal of each rat were removed, cleaned, and weighed. Body weights and food consumptions were also recorded. Anti inflammatory Activity a tocopherol pouch test Male rats which weighed 120 g were selected for testing. A rapid subcutaneous injection of 25 mL of air was made between the scapulae of each rat. This resulted in the establishment of an airfilled pouch into which 0.5 mL of dl a tocopherol was injected. The test compound was administered in daily oral doses for 7 days beginning on the day of pouch formation. The compound to be tested was suspended in 1 gum tragacanth. Twenty four hours after the last medication, the pouches were dissected free, and the fluid volume was measured. The inhibition of liquid exudate is a measure of the anti inflammatory activity. Glycogenic Activity Mature male rats were bilaterally adrenalectomized 5 days prior to the test.These rats were medicated orally with the test compound for 5 days. Seven hours after the last medication, the rats which have been fasted overnight were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and a portion of one lobe of the liver was removed and frozen on dry ice for subsequent glycogen determination. The compounds of the invention can be formulated for topical application by solution or dispersion in a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, cream or ointment base. The effective ingredient is preferably present in a concentration of 0.01 to 5.0 by weight. The compounds of the invention can be formulated for oral administration in tablet or capsule form with conventional excipients. The active ingredient is preferably present in an amount of 1 mg to 100 mg per unit dosage form. The following examples will further illustrate the invention.

The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at 5 C. and then a solution of 114 mL 1.85 mol of methyl formate in 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran was added slowly. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then poured onto a mixture of icewater t1500 mL and 6N hydrochloric acid 265 mL . The product was extracted with ether and the combined extracts were washed with water. The dried extract was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford an oil.This oil was triturated with hexane 4 x 250 mL and the combined triturates were dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford 55.37 g of a red oil, consisting essentially of the aboveentitled compound as established by proton NMR PMR spectral data. b 1 Ethenyl 6 4 fluorophenyl 3,4,9, 9a tetrahydro 9a methyl 6H naphtho 2,3 c pyrazole II R F . 4 Fluorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride 45.85 g, 0.282 mol and sodium acetate 23.14 g, 0.282 mol were added to a solution of 55.37 g 0.256 mol of the product obtained in part a above in 225 mL of glacial acetic acid. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature and then concentrated in vacuo to afford a semi solid.This material was suspended in ether 1 L and filtered to remove sodium chloride. The ether filtrate was washed with water 4 x 250 mL , saturated sodium bicarbonate until weakly basic and saturated sodium chloride 100 mL .
