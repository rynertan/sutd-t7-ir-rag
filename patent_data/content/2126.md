# Hydraulic brake for dampening motion between structures.

## Abstract
A hydraulic vibration snubber for use in nuclear power plants is privided with a casing 2 which is divided by a piston 4 into two chambers 15, 16 . A storage tank 27 of hydraulic fluid maintains proper pressure in the system by appropriate conduits and valves. The piston rod 3 penetrates the casing wall through a seal 17 which arrests fluid leakage. In this manner, no hydraulic fluid is lost at the seals and sufficient fluid is always available to enable the snubber to carry out its function, thereby eliminating the need for a number of burdensome inspections.
