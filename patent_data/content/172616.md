# Tomography.

## Abstract
A method for the construction of tomographic images of a body comprises placing an array of spaced electrodes in contact with the body, causing currents to flow in the body, by applying an electrical potential between pairs of electrodes in turn, calculating the potentials between other pairs of electrodes on the assumption that the body consists of one uniform medium, plotting the isopotentials corresponding to the calculated results to create an assumed image of the body, measuring initial potentials between those other pairs of electrodes in sequence over the array of electrodes, measuring subsequent potentials between the same pairs of electrodes in the sequence after a change in the internal state of the body, determining the ratios between the initial potentials and the subsequent potentials in each case, and modifying the image by back projecting the respective ratios along the appropriate isopotentials and thereby increasing the impedance along an isopotential in proportion to a ratio greater than unity or decreasing the impedance in proportion to a ratio less than unity.
