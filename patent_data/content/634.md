## Description
SPECIFICATION CHEMICAL PROCESS The present invention relates to the preparation of naphthylamine sulphonic acids. Naphthylamine sulphonic acids are important starting materials for the production of dyestuffs by diazotisation followed oupling with various coupling components. They are formally made by aqueous Bechamp reduction of the coresponding Nitro acid as its ammonium salt. While this less gives reasonably high yields of about 88 , the r u ction period is prolonged. The reduction time iN num ut 12 hours and this is followed by a further aproximate 20 hours for ashing out of iron, filtration washing of iron sludge. Also the process is carried it under slightly acidic conditions which causes corrosion oblems, particularly when using stainless steel reactors. Attempts at catalytic hydrogenation of the Nitro acids have been totally unsatisfactory, as large amounts of insoluble unknown inpurity is formed. In addition, absorption of hydrogen quite frequently ceases very quickly, and catalyst poisoning is apparent. We have now, surprisingly, found that the correspondingNitro acid as its sodium salt can be catalytically hydrogenated easily and quickly in very high yields. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of naphthylamine sulphonic acids which comprises catalytically hydrogenating an alkali metal salt of the corresponding nitro naphthalene sulphonic a at a substantially neutral pH. The process is suitable for the preparation of va1 naphthylamine sulphonic acids, such as 1 naphthylamine sulphonic acid Peri acid 1 naphthylamine 5 sulphonic acid Laurents acid l naphthylamine 6 sulphonic acid 1,6 Cleves l naphthylamine 7 sulphonic acid 1,7 Cleves acid and s mixture of the two isomers mixed Cleves acid or, preferabl 2 naphthylamine 4,8 disulphonic acid C acid . The catalyst may be any that is known for carrying our catalytic hydrogenation reactions, such as nickel, ruthenium rhodium, platinum and palladium. We prefer to use pallaa on charcoal as the catalyst, in suitable catalytic amounts.For example, when using 5 palladium on charcoal, about 2 catalyst relative to the Nitro acid is suitable. This i about 0.1 palladium based on the Nitro acid, although smal amounts, e.g. 0.005 palladium based on the Nitro acid, can be used with more efficient agitation and mixing of the rea wt e.g. in a spray nozzle high circulation reactor such as aBuss loop reactor. The alkali metal salt may be, for example,. the sodium potassium salt, but is preferably the sodium salt. The pH of the reaction mixture should be substantially neutral and may range from 6.0 to 8.0, but is preferably fir 7.0 to 7.5. The reaction is carried out at elevated temperatures an elevated pressure. The reaction temperature may be from 60 C to 200 C., preferably from 900C.jto 120 C. The pressure may be from 15 to 1400 psi, preferably from 70 to 420 psi. The Nitro acid salt may be used at various concentrations, and may be used as a slurry it water or as a solution. At a temperature of 90 93 C. the salt is completely in solution at a concentration of 15 w v. At higher amounts of salt, some of it is out of solution. In such cases it is preferred to dose the reaction mixture as the reaction proceeded with more of the salt, so enabling reactions at higher concentrations. Such a process an be carriedout, for example, in a Buss loop re ach. The only upper limit to the concentration is that at the end of the reaction the resulting acid should be in solution, so that the catalyst can be removed by filtration. The alkali metal salt of the Nitro acid may be obtained by reacting the ammon fum salt which is normally used in the Béchamp reduction pith caustic alkali, e.g. caustic soda liquor to pH 10.5. The solution is then boiled to liberate ammonia after which the pH is re adjusted to neutral, preferably at 90 95 C., prior to catalytic hydrogenation. This may be carried out by adding a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid. To carry out the catalytic hydrogenation the following procedure is preferred. The catalyst is added to the Nitro acid salt solution or slurry, the mixture is stirred and introduced into a pressure vessel. The vessel is then purged either with hydrogen or an inert gas such as nitrogen. With good agitation, hydrogen is then introduced under pressure, e.g. 70 p.s.i., and the mixture is heated to about 100 C. These conditions should be maintained until hydrogen is no longer taken up. This normally takes about 1 1 hours, although the time may vary depending on the reaction temperature, pressure, amount of catalyst and efficiency of stirring, as is well known in catalytic reduction processes. When no more hydrogen is taken up the reaction conditions are preferably maintained for a short period to ensure that the reduction is complete. This additional time may be up to about 30 minutes, but normally 15 minutes is sufficient. The pressure is then released and the hot reaction solution filtered to remove the catalyst, and leave the desired acid in solution. The acid may be recovered by precipitating from solution by acidifying the solution to pH 1 or below with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, adding salt and cooling, followed by filtration. The amount of salt added may be from 10 to 30 w v, but is preferably about 23 w v. The mixture is preferably cooled to ambient temperature of, say, 15 250C., to give a yield of acid of up to about 95 of theory. This yield can be increased even more by cooling to a lower temperature, for example to 50C. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples, in which parts by weight bear the same relationship to parts by volume as do kilograms to litres.Example 1A. Preparation of the sodium salt of 2 nitro naphthalene 4, 8 disulphonic acid To 300 parts by volume of hot water were added, with stirring, 75.5 parts by weight of the annonium salt of 2 nitro naphthalene 4,8 disulphonic acid. The mixture was heated to 90 C. to give complete solution and then 33 parts by weight of caustic soda liquor s.g. 1.50 were added to give pH 10.5. Water was added to bring the total volume up to 500 parts, and the solution was then boiled for 1 hours to remove ammonia. The pH was then adjusted to 7.0 7.5 at 90 95eC. by adding 5.7 parts by weight of hydrochloric acid s.g. 1.14 . B. Preparation of 2 naphthylamine 4,8 disulphonic acid To 500 parts by volume of the solution of the sodium salt prepared above were added 1.51 parts by weight of catalyst, comprising 5 palladium on charcoal, and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. The mixture was then transferred into a pressure vessel which was closed and purged twice with hydrogen. With agitation, hydrogen was introduced at 70 psi, and the mixture was heated to 1000C. After 1 hours the consumption of hydrogen ceased.The reaction conditions were then maintained for a further 15 minutes to ensure that the reduction was complete. The pressure was then released and the catalyst filtered off, and washed with water. 40 Parts by weight of hydrochloric acid s.g. 1.14 were added to the solution to reduce the pH to below 1.There was then added 109 parts by weight sodium chloride, the mixture was cooled to 200C., and the product filtered off. The yield of product was 85 parts by weight, 92.5 theory .Examples 2 5 The procedure described in Example 1B was repeated, using various concentrations, pH values and reaction times.
