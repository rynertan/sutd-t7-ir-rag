# Oscillation compensating apparatus for vortex flow meter.

## Abstract
In a vortex flow meter for measuring a varying flow rate of a fluid through a conduit, an oscillation compensating apparatus 10 is constructed to remove undesirable exter nally derived oscillation noise which is applied to the flow meter. An elongate vortex shedding member 12 extends into the conduit 14 through part of its wall. The shedding member 12 forms a shedding portion inside the conduit 14 and a compensating portion outside the conduit. The shedding portion carries a first oscillation sensor 22 therewith and the compensating portion, a second oscilla tion sensor 24 . The first sensor 22 is sensitive to an oscillation component caused in the shedding portion by a vortex train shed in the conduit, and an externally derived oscillation noise component. The second sensor 24 is sensitive to the noise component only. All these sensed components are combined to cancel the oscillation noise so that only the oscillation component in the shedding portion is picked up.
