# Control system for a line printer having an endless type carrier.

## Abstract
This control system for a multispeed multipitch line printer basically comprises two read write memories called the Band Image Buffer 19 and the Print Line Buffer 17 . The Band Image Buffer 19 is loaded with the character image of the print band or chain 10 and can be visualized as an electronic band running in synchronism with the type carrier 10 . The Print Line Buffer 17 is loaded with a line of data to be printed. Both buffers 17, 19 are read during each option time of a print subscan, their contents are compared in a comparator 47 which controls the hammer firing circuits 51, 53 , and their respective address registers 23, 22 are modified to a new value at the end of each subscan. A control bit is stored in a check buffer 20 to detect the end of each subscan. Comparison of the contents of the Band Image and Print Line Buffers 19, 17 continues until the control bit is detected signifying that a Band Image Buffer correction cycle followed by a Print Line Buffer correction cycle should be performed.
