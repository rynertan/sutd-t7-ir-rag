# Method of loading porous fibrous plaques.

## Abstract
A battery electrode is made by applying a wet active material paste 10 to a porous, compressible, fibrous plaque 11 , forcing the paste 10 unto the plaque pore volume, and sizing the loaded plaque according to the relationship T M GS W D where T is sized thickness, M is the amount of active material solide loading applied to give a required capacity to the loaded plaque, G is the specific gravity of the active material, S is the fraction solids of the active material, W is the unit plaque weight, and D is the density of the plaque fibers.
