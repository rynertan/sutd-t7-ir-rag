# Steelmaking of an extremely low carbon steel in a converter.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a process for producing an ex tremely low carbon steel in a top and bottom blown con verter, and characterized in that an ordinary decarburiza tion is carried out until the content of carbon in a molten steel reaches a specified range final decarburizing stage , and then a mixed gas of oxygen and an inert gas is blown through a top blowing lance.
