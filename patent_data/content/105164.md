## Description
Process for the chlorination of oxidic materials This invention relates to the fluidised bed chlorination of oxidic materials. The scope of the invention encompasses both total chlorination, whereby both an iron fraction and another desired metal fraction in an oxidic material are chlorinated, or whereby a beneficiate, from which one fraction has already been removed, is chlorinated, and partial chlorination, whereby a beneficiate is produced by the preferential chlorination of an iron fraction or whereby a fraction more readily chlorinated than the iron fraction is removed from that iron fraction. The term oxidic material is understood to include oxidic metalliferous deposits in the form of ores or sands and to include processed, for example beneficiated or partially beneficiated, ores or sands. Many fluidised bed chlorination processes are conducted at temperatures in excess of 8000C and very often in excess of 9000C, for example up to 12000C. Such processes are subject to operating difficulties as a result of the presence of often small but appreciable auantities of metal oxides which chlorinate to give lower melting point chlorides having a low vapour pressure with the result that, at such chlorination temperatures, they remain in the fluidised bed in the liquid form and, as the chlorination progresses, gradually build up in content in the bed and at some point cause bed agglomeration and cessation of the process.More specifically, magnesium, manganese and calcium chlorides, the oxides of some or all of which are usually present as minor constituents in oxidic ores, all have melting points below 8000C and very low vapour pressures. At 8000C, the maximum vapour partial pressure of manganese chloride is below 0.002, of magnesium chloride is below 0.0004 and of calcium chloride is below 0.00002 atmospheres. It can be seen from this that even a small content of these chlorides can give rise to operational problems, particularly in continuously operated processes.Iron oxide present in an ore may also give rise to cons iderable difficulties since it may be present in substantial quantity and, while ferric chloride has a relatively high vapour pressure, ferrous chloride has not and notoriously gives rise to operational problems when formed. Ferrous chloride melts at below 7000C and at 800or has a maximum vapour pressure of about 0.08 atmospheres. Many of the problems outlined above would be alleviated, were the chlorination temperature to be below the melting point of the particular chloride or chlorides present in sufficient quantity to give rise to the problems, namely below 7720C where the chloride of concern is calcium chloride and below 7080C, 670 C or 650 C respectively when it is, respectively, magnesium chloride ferrous chloride or manganese chloride. It has been proposed in European Patent Publication No.0029699 to chlorinate titaniferous materials at temperatures of at least about 6000C by using a porous carbon reductant having a substantial internal porosity in the form of micropores of less than 20 Angstroms in diameter, namelv active carbon. This active carbon may be produced by heating a high rank coal such as anthracite in a fluidised bed with air, carbon dioxide and or steam until the micropores are produced. Typically, 5 or more of the carbon will be burned off. Advantageously, the surface area of the less than 20 Angstrom micropores is at least about 100m2 g.In the process described in European PatentPublication No 0029699 the extent of reaction was deduced bv observing the quantity of unreacted chlorine in the effluent from the chlorination bed and it is shown by examples of the chlorination of rutile ore containing 96 Ti02 that, at a chlorination temperature of 6500C a consumption of chlorine in the region of 98 was achieved using a porous carbon formed by burning off 40 by weight of an anthracite in the presence of steam at 8900C to give a surface area of 58nm2 a but that a below 80 consumption of chlorine was achieved at the same temperature when only 15 by weight of the anthracite was burned off in air at 4500C to give a surface area of 163m2 g. British Patent No. 1601085 discloses the chlorination of a kaolinitic ore by chlorinating pre calcined ore at 6250C to 9000C in the presence of a carbonaceous reductant and a gaseous boron trifluoride catalyst. The carbonaceous reductant may be selected indiscriminately from a petroleum coke, a coal, a coal coke or a lignite char if the boron trifluoride catalyst is used. United States Patent Mo. 4284607 acknowledaes the use of activated carbon to achieve the chlorination of aluminous materials and teaches the use of preformed green coke which is then calcined at at least 6500C but less than 900n e. Green petroleum coke is the preferred areen coke. This patent exemplifies only the chlorination of alumina using calcined green petroleum coke. While activated carbon is undoubtedly extremely effective in low temperature chlorinations it is extensive to produce. Commercial activated carbon reauires a multistage production process and even the simpler production process disclosed in the above referencedEuropean patent specification involves the consumption of a large proportion of the coal used as a startina material which in itself involves a cost penalty, particularly in those processes which require no external heat generation, except for process start up, such as the chlorination of rutile. The use of a preformed coke, such as a petroleum coke, is also expensive in the large tonnages required in commercial scale processes. The present invention is based on the finding that a cheaper source of carbon than activated carbon or petroleum coke may be utilised in the low temperature chlorination of oxidic materials, without the need for a boron trifluoride catalyst or, indeed any other catalyst provided that the raw materials, both the source of the carbon and the ore, are carefully matched in a manner not taught in the art. The present invention provides a process for the chlorination of an oxidic material comprising contacting a fluidised mixture of particles of the oxidic material and particles of carbon at a temperature below 7720C but at least 5000C with chlorine the oxidic material being chlorinatable at a temperature below 7720C but at least 500or in the presence of active carbon, and removing from the oxidic material so contacted vaporous chlorides, characterised in that the oxidic material has a surface area of at least 3. 5m2 g and in that the carbon is the product of heating a non caking or weakly caking coal in the substantial absence of oxygen until its surface area is at least 3m2 g. Preferably the coal has a British SwellingNumber British Standard 1016, Part 12, entitled Caking and swelling properties of coal of less than 3 1 2 and, preferably, of less than 1. Preferably the fluidised mixture contacted with chlorine has a temperature of below 6500C. For the first time it has been realised that the surface area of the oxidic material is of importance if a form of carbon less reactive than active carbon is to be used at the low temperature envisaged by the present invention. One ore commonly stated to be chlorinated in the presence of active carbon, rutile, does not have the required surface area and does not chlorinate to the degree required for satisfactory operation according to the present invention. For this reason it has not been realised that, for example, other titanium dioxide ores may be chlorinatable at low temperature using a less reactive carbon as has now proved to be the case with ilmenite which has the surface area specified by the present invention.Preferably, the surface area of the ore is at least 5.Om2 9. Certain ores, because of their chemical composition will not chlorinate at low temperature even in the presence of active carbon. Those skilled in the art will be aware of which ores exhibit such behaviour. Chromite is an example of an iron containing ore which is not chlorinatable in the presence of active carbon at below 6700C and this ore is, therefore, excluded from the present invention.Whether an ore is within the invention or not on this score may be determined on a test scale using laboratory fluidised bed equipment by forming a fluidised bed of particles of the ore and particles of active carbon, the carbon being present in at least sufficient quantity to react with any oxygen evolved in or added to the bed, raising the temperature to the appropriate temperature as defined earlier, introducino a flow of 80 by volume chlorine into the bed and monitoring the quantity of chlorine in the effluent from the bed to determine whether reaction has taken place. In the tynical commercial plant the chlorinator operates with a bed depth of approximately 3 metres, and it is desired to minimise the chlorine slip past the bed.It is not possible to operate a small capacity test rig with such a bed depth due to problems with the dynamics of fluidisation However it is possible to operate a test rig with a bed depth of 1 to 1.5 metres, and from this to determine the acceptability of an ore in the full size plant. The use of such a unit is described in the examples. In such a test unit, preferably chlorine should not be present in the effluent gas in more than 25 by volume, particularly preferably not more than 20 by volume until the ore in the bed has been more than 50 by weight reacted.A similar test can be conducted at a lower temperature, for example below 650or, if the ore contains a proportion of manganese oxide which is likely to be troublesome in practice, or at a higher temperature for example below 7720C if the ore contains onlv a proportion of calcium oxide which is likely to be trouhlesome in practice, for example more than 0.28 by weight of either of said oxides, or if it contains iron oxide and if the proposed conditions of chlorination may lead to the formation of ferrous chloride. In order to produce a carbon having a surface area suitable for use according to this invention, fully caking coals must be avoided. Typical of fully caking coals are the bituminous coals having a British Standard CrucibleSwelling number above about 6 1 2 which are commonly used in the production of coke because their swelling properties give the coke particles the physical strength often required in cokes. Fully caking coals give coked products having too low a surface area for use according to this invention and bituminous char, for example, usually has a surface area well below l.0m2 g. Cokes of non coal origin, such as regular calcined petroleum coke, have a similarly unsuitable low surface area.Preferably the coal has a swelling number of greater than 1 2 Coals having a swelling number of 0 tend to produce carbon particles which disintegrate in use. It is found that anthracites, while they produce excellent active carbon when treated under activating conditions, produce carbon products having too low a surface area for use according to this invention when treated under non activating conditions. True lignites produce carbon having too little physical strength for fluidised bed use.Suitable coals for use in this invention are preferably selected from semi anthracites, carbonaceous coals, certain para bituminous coals and lignitous coals, as defined according to Seyler s Classification, subject to suitable swelling properties. The coal is selected to be of fluidisable size, that is at least 37 microns, but is particularly preferably at least 75 microns and up to 4000 microns in diameter, and may suitably have a weight mean average diameter of from 500 to 1200 microns, since it is preferred that the carbon product produced by treating it is used as produced without such need for treatment to alter its particle size and since the above specified sizes are suitable for carbon for fluidised bed use. The de volatilising heat treatment of the coal to produce a carbon product usable according to this invention is to be contrasted with activation, which involves heating in the presence of oxygen and, possibly, of an activating gas such as steam or carbon dioxide and involves the combustion of a substantial part of the coal. In such processes the oxygen is often supplied as air. Some oxygen may fortuitously be present during the coal treatment according to the invention but it is preferably in less than 10 by volume of the atmosphere during the heating so that the quantity of coal combusted may be, preferably, less than 5 by weight and particularly preferably, less than 2.5 by weight. Where the coal is weakly caking, for example having a British Standard Crucible Swelling Number of from 1 to 3 1 2, it is advantageously subjected to a pre oxidation treatment to reducing the caking characteristics before the devolatilising heat treatment in the substantial absence of oxygen. Suitably, the pre oxidation treatment may be conducted in the presence of an air atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere,preferably of no greater than air concentration but containing at least 108 oxygen by volume, at a temperature of at least 1500C for example from 2000C 2500C and,necessarily, no greater than 350or for a duration,preferably, of less than 120 minutes, and, particularly preferably, of from 30 minutes to 80 minutes. This treatment is suitably conducted in a fluidised bed.The heating in the substantial absence of oxygen is preferably conducted at a temperature of less than 10000C, for example suitably less than 9000C, very suitably by raising the temperature progressively, from the pre oxidation temperature where appropriate over a period of from 15 minutes to 150 minutes. This treatment is also preferably conducted in a fluidised bed. The need for pre oxidation of a weakly caking coal may be reduced or eliminated by blending such a coal with a sufficient portion of a previously devolatalised coal so as to reduce the average caking properties of the blend e.g. to a BritishStandard Swelling Number of below 1. Where an excess of carbon is used in a chlorination this recycled excess may advantageously be utilised in this manner. Advantageously the carbon product so produced may have a surface area of up to 50m2 g for example, very suitably of up to 40m2 g although lower surface area carbon for example having a total surface area below 20 or even below 15m2 g is usable according to this invention. It will be appreciated that the surface area figures quoted herein relate to total surface area measured by low temperature nitrogen absorption after carefully degassing in Strohlein Area Meter followed by confirmation on B.E.T. apparatus. The chlorination according to the present invention may itself be conducted by using known techniques. The oxidic material is preferably at least 75 microns and up to 1000 microns in diameter and may suitably have a weight mean average particle size of from 150 to 400 microns. The quantity of carbon is preferably at least sufficient to react with any oxygen added or evolved in the fluidised bed, for example at least 20 , e.g. from 20 to 40 , by weight of the bed. The temperature of the chlorination may be controlled at the desired low value by control of the quantity of any added oxygen , by control of the velocity of the chlorinating gases and of the heat losses from the chlorinator so as to maintain a steady temperature state at a level initially achieved by pre heating the fluidised bed. The use of added oxygen will depend on whether it is necessary to provide heat to the chlorination process as may be the case for example, when an ore is being beneficiated by the selective chlorination of iron values.Preferably the quantity of any added oxygen is not more than 10 by volune of the gases at any point in the chlorination fluidised bed. Suitably, the concentration of chlorine is from 20 to 85 by volume of the gases entering the fluidised bed. The vaporous chlorides leaving the fluidised bed may be treated by known means to recover them, for example by oxidation to recover chlorine if the purpose of the process has merely been to remove the metal values contained in the chlorides from the ore, not to produce a metal chloride product for later use. In beneficiation processes, for example, the chlorine is suitably recovered from the resulting iron chlorides for recycle. Due to the low temperature employed in the practice of this invention, the tendency for bed agglomeration due to the presence of liquid chlorides is reduced or eliminated such chlorides either remaining in solid form in the bed residue or being blown out of the bed as dust in the effluent gases. The present invention opens the use of a very economical source of carbon for the low temperature chlorination of oxidic materials. Due to the possibility of avoiding a burn off of any substantial part of the coal, there is a substantial cost advantage over active carbon. There are many ore leaching processes where an ore is subjected to a reduction step by heating at about from 50OO t to 8000C in the presence of an excess of reducing agent, suitably coal, in the absence of air prior to acid leaching to remove one or more constituents therefrom. Before the leaching step the excess of reducing agent is removed from the ore. Where a non caking or weakly caking coal is used as the reducing agent, the carbon thus recovered is suitable for use in the present process, enabling the present process to be carried out particularly economically in the vicinity of an acid leaching ore treatment process employing a reduction step. The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples. Examples 1 3, 7 and 8 are not according to the invention and are inserted for comparative purposes.Examples 4 6 and 9 are according to the invention. Example 1 describes the chlorination of ilmenite using a commercial petroleum coke as a source of carbon. Example 2 describes the chlorination of ilmenite using carbon obtained by heating a strongly caking bituminous coal. Example 3 describes the chlorination of ilmenite using carbon obtained by heating anthracite. Examples 4 5 describe the chlorination of ilmenite using carbons according to the present invention. Examples 6 7 describe the chlorination of different ilmenite beneficiates using carbons according to the invention but an ore within the invention in Example 6 and outsi6e it in Example 7. Example 8 describes an attempt to chlorinate rutile using carbon according to the invention. Example 9 describes the chlorination of bauxite usina carbon according to the invention. In each example an apparatus consisting of a fused silica fluidised bed reactor enclosed in a gas fired furnace is used, mixed fluicisaticn and reaction gases are fed into the base of the reactor via a conical distributor of fused silica, their proportions in the mixture being controlled by metering equipment. Reaction products are passed from the reactor top along a horizontal cooling duct to a cyclone and the gases remaining are then fed via a gas sampling point and a caustic scrubber to the atmosphere. A valve at the base of the reactor enable the contents of the reactor to be dumped. Example 1 The reactor charge was 24kg Western Australian ilmenite ore having a particle size of 75 to 300 microns and analysing 54.5 of Ti02, 23.78 FeO, 17.cm Fe203 an small quantities of impurities including magnesiur,mancanese and calcium oxides, and 6kg of Conoco regular calcined petroleum coke having a particle size less than 1700 microns. The surface area of the ilmenite was 5m2 g and that of the coke 0.4m2 g. The reactor charge was fluidised with a flow of nitrogen and heated to 6100C by means of the gas furnace and during the heating 15 1 mien of air was mixed with the fluidising gas.When the stated temperature was reached the fluidising gas was replaced by a mixture of 20 1 mien C12, ifl 1 mien air and 18 1 mien N2 giving a chlorine concentration in the fluidising gases of 41 v v.The temperature of the fluidised bed was maintained within the limits 6100C 6300C. Chlorine was detected in the ked effluent gases from the onset of the run and the level of chlorine increased sharply after 57 minutes to such an extent that it was visible to the eye, indicating a sudden decrease in the extent of chlorination to an unacceDtable level. At this point the solids in the bed were found to contain 63 wt Ti02, a substantial iron content mainly in the ferric form and a large quantity of residual coke.It was concluded, since the chlorination was not proceeding satisfactorily in the presence of the coke, that the initial 57 minutes of reaction had been due to the initial ferrous oxide content of the ore, acting as reductant instead of the coke in the process, being converted to ferric oxide. vhis was therfore judged to be a failure. Example 2 The reactor charge was 30kg of the same ilmenite ore and 7.5kg of devolatilised bituminous coking coal atop, Lancs 27.4 W W volatiles on a dry basis, Swelling no. 8 1 2 coal having a particle size of less than 2000 microns and a surface area of 0.3m2 g. As in example 1, the reactor charge was initially heated, to 6100C, while fluidised with nitrogen, and the bed temperature mantained between the limits 610 6300C during the run. The fluidising gas during the run contained 30 v v Cl2. After 45 minutes of reaction the chlorine slip had increased to give an effluent chlorine concentration of more than 10 v v. At this point the chlorine concentration in the fluidising gas was reduced to 10 v v but the chlorine slip remained at a 9 v v content on the effluent gas, showing that reaction had shstantially ceased. The bed was found to contain a substantial auantity of iron oxide and of carbon.This run was therfore judge to be a failure. Example 3 Example 2 was repeated except that the carbon was a devolatilised rank 101 anthracite having a particle size of less than 2000 microns and a surface area of 1.5m2 g and the bed was initially heated to 6000C. The fluidisino cas during the run contained 20 v v C12. After 69 minutes of reaction the chlorine slip had risen to greater than 10 v v in the effluent gases after which a reduction to 10 v v C33 still gave a chlorine concentration in the effluent qases of 8 v v. Again the reaction had ceased leaving a substantial quantity of iron values unchlorinated and carbon unconsumed.This run was therfore judged to be a failure. Example 4 A slightly caking lignitous hard coal from Markham,Doncaster having a British Standard Swelling lumber of 2, a rank of 802 and a content of volatile matter of 38 on a rv basis was blended with an equal weight of the same coal which had previously been subjected to this treatment. he resulting blend was introduced into a devolatilising furnace at 7800C whereupon the temperature fell to 300 over 26 minutes and was then raised to 9500 over a further 15 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere. The coal fraction in the blend had then been devolatilised and the blend had a particle size of less than 2000 microns and a surface area of 8m2 g. The reactor charge was 30kg of the same ilmenite ore as in the previous examples and 7.5kg of the devolatilised coal blend giving a fluidised bed depth of 1.3m. The reactor was heated to 5500C, by means of the gas furnace, while being fluidised with nitrogen and the temperature during the subseauent run in which the fluidising gas was 22 1 mien C12, 10 1 mien air and 22 1 mien N2, was maintained between 590or and 625 C. The run was continued for 3 hours with no slippage of chlorine through the bed, this time being calculated to be sufficient to chlorinate all the iron in the ore. At this point the concentration of chlorine in the fluidisinq aas was increased to 80 v v and after a delay to allow table measurements to be obtained the chlorine slip was found to be 18 v v in the effluent gases. The concentration of chlorine in the fluidising gas was then decreased to 20 v v and after a similar delay the chlorine slip was found to ee 5.5 v v. It is concluded that a bed of, e.g., 3m fluidised depth could be operated with substantially complete chlorine utilisation. Example 5 Example 4 was repeated except that the carbon wasReject Smokeless Fuel available from the sTational roal Board Markham Coal devolatilised at 4000C which was introduced into a furnace at 5000C, whereupon the temperature fell to 1700C, and was then heated to 950 e, over 210 minutes all under nitrogen. The surface area of this carbon was 18m2 g. The chlorination run proceeded without chlorine slip for 3 hours as before. he chlorine slip at 80 by volume chlorine in the fluidisinq cas was 148 v v and that at 20 by volume chlorine was less than 0.1 v v. It is concluded that a bed of 2 3 fluidised bed depth could be operated with substantially complete chlorine utilisation. Example 6 The reactor charge was 21.1 kg of beneficiated ilmenite Benelite type available from Kerr McGee Corporation having a surface area of 11.5m2g and 5.3kg of devoZatilised Markham coal British Standard Swelling No 2 heated at 2000C 2600C in air for 50 minutes and then heated to a00or in nitrogen over 90 minutes having a surface area of m2 a. The change was fluidised bed depth 0.95m heated to 6 OOr under inert conditions and chlorine was then introduced at a concentration of 80 by volume in the fluidising gas. she run was conducted at 6170 6300C.The chlorine slip was 22 by volume in the effluent gases.However the chlorine slip at 20 v v was found to be only 5.2 v v. It is concluded that a bed of e.g. 3m depth could be operated with substantially complete chlorine utilisation. Example 7 The reactor charge was 30kg of an ilmenite henificiate available from Associated Mineral nonsolidated AMC havina a surface area of 3 m2g and 7.5 kg of devolatilised rxarkham coal British Standard Swelling No 2 heated in air at 200 2600C for 1 hour introduced into a furnace under inert conditions at 2000C where upon the temperature fell to 1 noon and was then raised to 8200C over 130 minutes having a surface area of 11.6m2 g. The charge was fluidised and heated to 6100C under inert conditions and chlorine was then introduced at 80 v v concentration in the fluidisinq aas. An initial period of reaction was observed, possibly due to the action of Ti203 present in this ore as an internal reductant. After 90 minutes of operation the chlorine slip was such that it was much greater than the capacity of the measuring instrument. The chlorine concentration in the fluidising gas was then reduced to 15 v v after which the chlorine slip reduced only to 11 12 1 2 v v with litt e visual indication of chlorine in the off aases. This run was therefore judged to be a failure. Example 8 The reactor charge was 30k Australian Putile ore having a surface area of less than O.lm2g and 7.5 kg of devolatalised coal Merthyr Valley semi anthracite Coal,Rank 201, 11.9 v v volatiles on a dry basis, BritishSwelling No below 1 which did not require pre oxidation hut was introduced into a furnace under nitrogen at 2000r whereupon the temperature fell to SOOC, remained at 50 C for 30 minutes and was then raised to 500C over 10 minutes and then to 8000C over a further 125 minutes , havina a surface area of ll.9m2 g and a particle size of less than 2 00 microns. The charge was fluidised giving a bed depth of 1.3m and heated to 6000C under inert conditions. Chlorine was then introduced at a concentration of 80 by volume in the fluidising gas which also contained air 45 l min Cl2, 5 l min air, 5 l min N2 . The run was conducted at 6300 640 C and chlorine slip was found to be above the cacl of the measuring instrument, althouch a small auantitv of TiC14 was evident. The concentration of chlorine in the fluidising gas was reduced to 50 v v keeping the auantitv of oxygen and the total fluidising gas flow constant. The amount of chlorine slip was still above the capacity of the instrument.The concentration of chlorine was then similarly reduced to 25 v v in the fluidising gas and the chlorine slip was measured at 15.5 v v in the effluent gases. This run was therefore judged to be a failure. Example 9 The reactor charge was 22 kg Ghanaian Bauxite having a surface area of 64m2 g and a particle size of below 710 microns and analysing 50 A1203, 14.7 Fe203 with water of hydration, together with 7.5kg of devolatilised Markham coal British Standard Swelling No 2 heated in air at 2000 2600C for 1 hour introduced into a furnace under inert conditions at 2500C whereupon the temperature fell to 210or and, after 1 hour, raised to 8000 over 110 minutes havina a surface area of 35m2 g and a particle size below 200no microns.The charge was fluidised with nitrogen and heated to 5Onon to dry the ore to give an analysis of the ore of 72 A12o3, 21.9 Fe203 and a surface area of 80m2 q. Chlorine was then introduced into the fluidising gas to give a concentration of 20 v v. The run temperature was conrolled at between 5950C and 6350C with the assistance of the addition of 10 1 mien of air during part of the run. rnhe bed effluent gases contained red ferric chloride fumes and no detectable chlorine.When a quantity of chlorine calculated to be sufficient to react with the iron content of the ore had been added the run was stopped and the bed was removed from the reactor and washed with dilute HC1 pH3. , to remove residual iron salts, and dried. The resulting material analysed 92.5 A1203 5 Fe203 and had a surface area of 118m2 g. The A1203 was amorphous, alpha alumina being absent. The fluidised bed reactor was washed out and dried. she bed material was recharged and heated to 600 C under nitrogen. Chlorine was then introduced into the fluidisino gas for the chlorination of the alumina the flow being A 1 mien C12, 3 1 mien air and 9 1 mien N2 to give a chlorine concentration of 80 v v. The bed temperature was maintained at from 6050 6200C and the chlorine slin was measured as 17 v v in the effluent gases. When the fluidising gas was altered to 12 l min Cl2, 15 l min air and 33 1 min N2 to give a chlorine concentration of 20 v v the chlorine slip was below 0.18 v v in the effluent gases. It was concluded that a bed of twice the depth actually present during the alumina chlorination could be operated with substantially complete chlorine utilisation. Aluminium chloride having a pale yellow colour analysing 95.8 Al C13 and 4.2 of FeC13 was condensed from the bed effluent gases.
