# A method of operating a machine tool.

## Abstract
A machine tool having an indexable workpiece support 10 . The tool holder 12 is moveable to enable the machine tool to operate on different parts of a workpiece 100 whilst the latter is held stationary by the workpiece support 10 . Indexing of the workpiece support 10 enables a part 10a thereof to be turned from a first position in which a workpiece 100 can be mounted on that part, to a second position to present such a workpiece 100 to the tool holder 12 . One workpiece 100 can be loaded on one part 10a of the workpiece support 10 whilst another workpiece on another part of the workpiece support 10 is being simul taneously machined by the machine tool.
