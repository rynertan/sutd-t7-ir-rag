# Insulated gate type field effect transistor having a silicon gate electrode.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to cross sectional shape of a silicon gate electrode of an insulated gate field effect transis tor. The gate electrode is composed of polycrystalline silicon, and its length, in cross section, gradually increases from the surface contacting to the gate insulating film toward the cen tral portion thereof and then gradually decreases toward the upper surface thereof. The central portion of the polycrystalline silicon has the largest length in the source drain direction and contains small amount of SiOâ‚‚ particles. Relying upon this gate shape, the portion having largest length, can be used as a mask to intro duce impurities in a self aligned manner to form source and drain regions. The thus formed source and drain regions create small capacity relative to the gate electrode. Therefore, a high speed transistor is realized.
