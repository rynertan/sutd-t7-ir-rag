# Lead aluminoborofluorosilicate moldable glasses.

## Abstract
Optical glass compositions capable of being shaped under the combined action of temperature and pressure in a mold so as to obtain articles having surfaces exhibiting highly precise reproduction of the mold walls have the following constitution SiO₂ 8 20 B₂O₃ 5 20 PbO 50 70 Al₂O₃ 1 11 F 2 7 expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis. The glasses demonstrate softening points not exceeding 500 C, refractive indices between 1.65 1.82 and Abbe numbers between 27 39.
