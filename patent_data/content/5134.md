# A METHOD OF AND AN APPARATUS FOR MARKING METAL OBJECTS

## Abstract
A method of and an apparatus for marking metal objects, especially metal billets at high temperature, are disclosed. The marking will enable selective identification of the object in question. A marking head 3 is utilized, having at least one electrode 4 for providing character is built up in a matrix form on the object 1 by means of an electric arc process. The characters consist of matrix parts in the form of welded on projections, in which case a consumable electrode is utilized, preferably in conjunction with the principles for gas metal arc welding, or alternatively of matrix parts in the form of recesses, in which case a non consumable electrode is utilized, preferably in conjunction with the principles for plasma arc cutting. The marking head 3 preferably comprises a sequence of electrodes 4 which are activated selectively in conjunction with relative displacement between the marking head and the metal object 1 to provide the desired character matrix parts. By sensing that necessary electrode current has been consumed in conjunction with an activation of an electrode, a confirmation can be obtained that the desired character matrix part has actually been provided.
