The terms C1 to C6 alkyl , C2 to C6 hydroxyalkyl , C2 to C6 protected aminoalkyl , C3 toC6 protected amino hydroxyalkyl , protected amino , and ...N protected... are as defined above for the compounds of the instant invention. Three of the above listed aminoglycoside substrates for the process of this invention, namely apramycin, lividamine and paromamine, are known compounds and therefore their synthesis or isolation can be found in the literature. The pseudodisaccharides nebramine, neamine, gentamine C1, gentamine Cla, gentamine C2, gentamine C2a, and gentamine C 2b are also known compounds and therefore their synthesis or isolation can also be found in the literature. These pseudodisaccharides can be converted to their 6 N protected derivatives which are required as substrates for the instant process by methods analogous to the procedure given in Example 4,Part A of the Experimental Section. The various substituted a or ss aprosaminide substrates listed above can be made by methods analogous to the procedure described by S. O Connor, et al.,Journal of Organic Chemistry, 41, 2087 1976 . The acylating agents used in the instant process are also known in the art. Additional examples for converting the known carboxylic acid precursors into suitable acylating agents for the process of this invention are given in Preparations 1 and 2 in theExperimental Section. As with the compounds claimed in the present invention, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that certain of the acylating agents, except for the reactive derivative of N protected glycyl, certainC1 to C6 alkyl chains and certain substituted C2 to C alkyl chains and C3 to C6 alkyl chains of the a or ss substituted aprosaminide substrates can exist as optical isomers. For the purposes of the process of this invention, these moieties can be used as their pure R or S configurations or as mixtures of equal or unequal proportions of these two configurations at each of the asymmetric carbon atoms. In the above description of the process of the instant invention, the formula Ni X 2 refers to a nickel salt wherein the nickel is in the formal II oxidation state, and X refers to a C1 toC10 carboxylate ligand. The term C1 to C10 carboxylate includes straight or branched chain aliphatic carboxylates, as well as aromatic carboxylates, with acetate being the preferred carboxylate. Exemplary nickel salts used in the instant process include Ni acetate 2 Ni propionate 2 Ni hexanoate 2 Ni 2 ethylhexanoate 2 Ni benzoate 2 Ni octanoate 2 Ni neodecanoate 2. Although not explicitly depicted in the above formula and examples, the nickel salts used in the process of this invention may be either anhydrous or hydrated. The term acylating agent , as used in the above description of the instant process, means a reactive derivative of a carboxylic acid which is capable in the instant process of coupling the acid to an amino group by an amide linkage. The carboxylic acids that are converted into reactive derivatives for use as acylating agents in the process of this invention are selected from a group consisting of y protected amino a hydroxybutyric acid, 8 protected amino a hydroxypropionic acid, N protected glycine,N protected 3 hydroxypyrrolidine 3 carboxylic acid,N protected 3 hydroxyazetidine 3 carboxylic acid, andN protected 2 hydroxy 2 azetidin 3 yl acetic acid.Examples of reactive derivatives of a carboxyl group are an acid halide, an acid anhydride, an activated ester, an acid azide and the like. Preferred reactive derivatives are acid anhydrides and activated esters, with the more preferred reactive derivatives being acid anhydrides and the activated esters formed with Nhydroxysuccinimide and N hydroxyphthalimide. After the 2 N protected and amino protected acyl derivative compounds have been prepared by the instant process, they can be converted to their corresponding deprotected acyl derivatives by procedures well known in the art. Furthermore, the above deprotected amino or deprotected nitrogen acyl derivative compounds may have their carbonyl groups reduced to methylene groups with diborane or lithium aluminum hydride these newly formed alkyl derivative compounds still retain biological activity. Methods for reducing the carbonyl groups are well known in the art, and include methods such as the ones described by K. Igarashi, et al. inU.S. Patent 4,201,774, herein incorporated by reference. An additional reference for the above reduction procedure is K. Richardson et al., J. Antibiotics, 30, 843 1977 . The alkylating agents used in the instant process are C2 to C4 alkyl bromide, C2 toC4 alkyl iodide, C3 to C5 allyl bromide, C3 to C5 allyl iodide, benzyl bromide, benzyl iodide, substituted benzyl bromide and substituted benzyl iodide. The preferred alkylating agents are ethyl iodide, n butyl bromide, n butyl iodide, allyl bromide, allyl iodide, and benzyl bromide. It should be noted that the instant process will result in the 2 ,6 di N acylation of nebramine, neamine, gentamine C1, gentamine Cla, gentamine C2, gentamine C2a, and gentamine C when the 6 amino C 2b group of these substrates is not protected. Therefore, in order to acylate the above pseudodisaccharide substrates on the 2 amino group only, it is necessary to block the 6 amino group with a suitable amino protecting group as defined above. This protecting group can then be removed after the 2 amino group is substituted to yield the desired aminoglycoside derivative. An example of a 6 N protection 2 N acylation 6 N deprotection procedure is given in Example 4 of theExperimental Section. The first step of the instant process involves forming the nickel salt aminoglycoside complex. This step is accomplished by mixing the aminoglycoside substrate compound and the nickel salt in water.Thorough mixing of these two components in the water is crucial and can be accomplished by employing methods such as sonication, vigorous stirring and mixing, moderate warming, etc. An aqueous solution is usually obtained if not, a thoroughly mixed or dispersed suspension is sufficient. Between about a 2 1 to about a 6 1 molar ratio of nickel salt aminoglycoside substrate can be used, with the usual ratio employed being about 4 1. The second step of the instant process entails diluting the above mixture with a polar, organic solvent. By the term polar, organic solvent we mean a solvent such as formamide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide, t butanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, acetone, sulfolane, tetramethylurea, 2 pyrrolidinone, N methylpyrrolidinone, dioxane, and the like, or a mixture of any of the above solvents, with the preferred solvent for acylation being dimethylformamide. The preferred polar, organic solvent for alkylation is also dimethylformamide. Between two and ten volumes of polar, organic solvent per volume of water can be used, with the usual amount employed being about 5 volumes of organic solvent per volume of water. The resultant mixture is usually stirred for about five minutes to about one hour before proceeding to the next step.The mixture can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous at this point. The final step of the instant process involves adding the appropriate acylating or alkylating agent to the mixture of step 2 of the process. The amount of acylating agent that can be used ranges from a 1 1 to a 2 1 ratio of acylating agent aminoglycoside, with about a 1.5 1 ratio being typical. A ratio range of 5 1 to 20 1 of alkylating agent aminoglycoside can be used, with the usual ratio employed being about 10 1. The time required to complete the acylation in the final step is not critical. The acylation reaction can be stirred for a period ranging between 0.5 and 24 hours, with the usual time being about 15 hours. The alkylation reaction requires longer periods of time, encompassing a range of fifteen hours to sixty hours. The temperature at which the instant process is carried out can range from between 0 C. to 400C.Typically the reaction is run between 200C. to 250C. Once the acylation reaction of the final step is completed, recognized isolation procedures may be utilized to obtain the desired purified product. One such procedure involves column chromatography on either silica gel or Chelex 100 resin BioRad Labs, 2200 WrightAve., Richmond, Ca. 94804 to adsorb the nickel salt from and separate the desired product from the resultant product mixture obtained from the instant process. To carry out this procedure, the solvent is evaporated in vacuo from the product mixture. The resultant residue is dissolved or suspended in an appropriate solvent and then loaded onto a column packed with the same solvent, using either Chelex 100 resin or silica gel as the stationary phase. An example of an appropriate solvent for use with the Chelex 100 resin is aqueous ammonium hydroxide. An example of an appropriate solvent for use with the silica gel is a 30 10 1 volume ratio of dichloromethane methanol ammonium hydroxide. The column is then eluted by common procedures gradient or stepwise . The product can be chromatographed again on a second column of ion exchange resin e.g., Bio Rex 70 or silica gel if necessary. Chelex 100 is a styrene divinylbenzene copolymer functionalized with iminodiacetate ions which act as chelating ligands for binding metal ions. Another isolation procedure removes Ni II ions by precipitation as the insoluble sulfide salts followed by ion exchange chromatography to separate the desired products. Specifically, this procedure involves a evaporating the solvent from the product mixture, dissolving the resultant residue in dilute acid e.g., Q.1N HC1 and bubbling hydrogen sulfide gas through this mixture until precipitation of the nickel ion is complete, and b chromatographing the filtered solution from step a on an ion exchange resin such as Bio Rex 70 BioRad Labs, supra using an ammonium hydroxide solution or gradient to elute the desired product. Bio Rex 70 is a weakly acidic cation exchange resin containing carboxylic acid groups on a macroreticular acrylic polymer lattice. Similar useful ion exchange resins are Amberlite CG 50 and AmberliteIRC 50 Rohm and Haas Co., Philadelphia, Pa. . The 2 N acylated and 2 N alkylated aminoglycosides made by the process of this invention, some of which having the 2 N substitutent in the protected amino or N protected form, and in addition some of the various pseudodisaccharides having the 6 amino group protected, are intermediates to their respective deprotected amino and N deprotected compounds. These 2 protected amino and N protected acyl derivatives can be converted to their corresponding deprotected forms according to procedures well recognized in the art.These deprotected compounds, either in their free base form or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, are useful for treating infections in warm blooded animals caused by gram positive and gramnegative bacteria. These compounds can be administered parenterally, in the free base form or in the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, using pharmaceutically acceptable formulations known in the art. These compounds can also be administered as veterinary compositions, such as, for example, in the feed or drinking water of farm animals to treat infections such as colibacillosis or swine disentery Alternatively, these compounds can be used as a surface disinfectant. Solutions containing as little as 0.01 percent by weight of the antibiotic are effective for disinfecting purposes.Such solutions, preferably also containing a detergent or other cleansing agent, are useful for disinfecting objects such as glassware, dental and surgical instruments, and surfaces such as walls, floors, and tables in areas where maintenance of sterile conditions is important, i.e.hospitals, food preparation areas, and the like. The antibacterial activity of the deprotected compounds of this invention is illustrated by the following in vitro and in vivo test data obtained with representative compounds. In Table I, the minimum inhibitory concentration MIC for representative compounds against a wide range of gram positive and gram negative bacteria is presented. The MIC values were obtained by the standard agar dilution test.

The residue was suspended in a 30 10 1 mixture of methanol dichloromethane concentrated ammonium hydroxide 40 ml and was loaded onto a silica gel column Grace 950, 150 g prewashed with the same solvent mixture.The column was eluted stepwise with eight different mixtures of methanol dichloromethane concentrated ammonium hydroxide a 30 10 1 400 ml , b 30 10 3 430 ml , c 30 10 5 900 ml , d 30 10 6 460 ml , e 30 10 7 1 1. f 30 10 8 400 ml , g 30.10 10 400 ml , h 30 10 15 400 ml . The fractions containing the desired product were combined, concentrated and lyophilized, yielding 785 mg of crude product. This material was dissolved in water, the solution s pH was adjusted to 8.8 and then the solution was loaded on a column of 300 ml Bio Rex 70 ammonium hydroxide cycle, pH 9.8, prewashed with 0.001N ammonium hydroxide 1 1 . The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.01N ammonium hydroxide 2 1. and 0.10N ammonium hydroxide 2 1 . Fractions containing the desired product were combined and lyophilized, yielding 2 N ethylapramycin 150 mg, 13 yield c.m.r. D20 H2O, pH 10 6 14.8, 30.8, 33.1, 36.8, 41.7, 50.4, 51.4, 53.5, 56.1, 61.8, 62.4, 66.3, 68.0, 71.4, 72.2, 73.8, 74.3, 76.9, 78.5, 88.5, 95.6, 96.4, 100.2 f.d.m.s. m e 567 P thin layer chromatography Rf 0.25 using a 6 2 3 volume ratio of methanol methylene chloride concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Example 6Preparation of 2 N n Butyl apramycin Method 1 Apramycin 54 mg, 0.1 mmol was dissolved in water 1 ml . Nickel acetate tetrahydrate 100 mg, 0.4 mmol was added and this solution was diluted with dimethylformamide 5 ml . The mixture was treated with l iodo n butane 0.115 ml, 1 mmol3 and this reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 days.Thin layer chromatographic analysis developed in 6 2 3 methanol dichloromethane ammonium hydroxide solution, visualized by chlorox spray and heating followed by starch iodine spray reagent of the reaction mixture showed 2 N n butyl apramycin as the major product Rf 0.35 along with unreacted apramycin Rf 0.18 . Bioautography of another thin layer chromatography plate against B. subtilis X12 showed a zone of inhibition due to 2 N n butyl apramycin. Method 2 The reaction of Method 1 was repeated using l bromo n butane 0.11 ml, 1 mmol instead of 1iodo n butane . This reaction appeared to give a lower yield of the desired 2 N n butyl apramycin than did the reaction of Method 1. Example 7Preparation of 2 N Benzylapramycin The reaction of Example 6, Method 1, was followed, except that benzyl bromide 0.06 ml, 0.5 mmol was used instead of l iodo n butane. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 19 h, at which time thin layer chromatographic analysis showed 2 N benzylapramycin R5 0.32 to be the major product.Bioautography of a second thin layer chromatography plate against B. subtilis X12 showed a zone of inhibition due to 2 N benzylapramycin. Example 8Preparation of 2 N Allylapramycin Method 1 The reaction of Example 6, Method 1, was followed, except that allyl bromide 0.043 ml. 0.5 mmol was used instead of l iodo n butane. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 22 h, at which time thin layer chromatographic analysis showed a substantial amount of 2 N allylapramycin Rf 0.27 was present along with an unidentified material Rf 0.38 and unreacted apramycin. Bioautography of a second thin layer chromatography plate against B. subtilis X12 showed a good zone of inhibition due to 2 N allylapramycin. Method 2 The reaction of Method 1 above was repeated, except that allyl iodide 0.05 ml, 0.55 mmol was used instead of allyl bromide. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 22 h, when thin layer chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture gave the same results as in Method 1.
