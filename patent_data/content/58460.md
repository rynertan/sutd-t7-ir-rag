# Method of, and apparatus for, orthocyclically winding coils.

## Abstract
A method of, and apparatus for, orthocyclically winding coils, in which a wire is wound about a core in such a manner that each winding extends at right angles to the axis of the core for the major part of its circumference, successive windings are virtually in contact with each other, and series of successive windings define layers of windings. According to the invention the first layer is wound with great precision by supplying the wire at an angle slightly different from the orthogonal feed in position, and guiding it down to the core by means of a wire depositing member. After the first layer has been wound, an end flange is positioned, the wire depositing member is swung out of position, and subse quent layers are wound on the first layer by feeding the wire to the core in an orthogonal position.
