# Method of and device for detecting displacement of paper sheets.

## Abstract
A displacement detection device which detects the dis placement of a paper sheet 13 in transit in a paper sheet sorter that picks up and transports the paper sheet 13 such as a bank note. The displacement detection device includes photo sensors 17, 18 which detect the leading edge of the paper sheet 13 that is being transported, and a photo position detector 19 which detects the distance from the conveyor belt 10a, 10b to the side edge of said paper sheet 13 . Each of said photo sensors comprises a light emitter 17a, 18a and a light receiver 17b, 18b which are arranged on opposite sides of the paper sheet. The photo position detector 19 is placed on the downstream side in the con veyance direction of the photo sensors 17, 18 , extending perpendicularly to the conveyance line, and comprises a light projector 21 and a light receiver 20 with linear form and equal length arranged symmetrically with respect to the paper sheet 13 . Signals from the photo sensors 17, 18 and photo position detector 19 are processed by a microcom puter to determine the passing interval, the inclination, and the lateral shift of the paper sheet.
