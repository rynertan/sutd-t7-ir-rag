# Combination instrusion detector system having correlated ultrasonic and microwave detection sub systems.

## Abstract
A motion alarm system having a combination of micro wave and ultrasonic subsystems is operative to reliably detect true moving targets and to discriminate false targets both caused by target motion reflected outside the surveill ance space and by noise and other interfering phenomena. Microwave and ultrasonic signals received from the surveill ance space are separately processed to provide ultrasonic motion detection signals and a microwave motion detection signal. A signal processing circuit interdependently com bines the signals for producing a correlated system event signal. The presence of a true moving target within the surveillance space produces sufficient correlation to cause the system event signal to meet predetermined alarm criteria. The presence of either interfering phenomena or unwanted reflected outside signals, or both simultaneously, produces insufficient correlation to cause the system output signal to meet the predetermined criteria. An alarm status is thereby only provided in response to a true moving target within the surveillance space, but not in response to the occurence of error producing sources for the sub systems individually or collectively.
