## Description
Short title Programme unit and punched card for use therewith. The invention relates to a programme unit for the programmed control of a device for adjusting the value of a physical quantity, said programme corresponding to a preselected variation of said quantity for a preselected time interval. Such a programme unit, which is intended to adjust the temperature value in a closed space with the aid of a central heating system, is known and comprises read in means in the form of, for example, push buttons which serve to load data corresponding to a desired programme. The physical quantity may be temperature, humidity, the flow rate of a pump in a. swimming pool, the light intensity in a room and so on. The known programme unit has a few disadvantages in practice . When loading the programme data with the aid of the buttons the user has no possibility of checking the correctness of the loading, which may be disadvantageous since the error chance of poorly skilled users is relatively great. Furthermores the known programme unit should have a random access memory RAM of the non volatile type in order to ensure that the programme will not be erased when mains voltage is interrupted. The invention has for its object to provide a programme unit which offers great flexibility of programming and substantially completely excludes errors, whilst said disadvantages of the prior art are obviated. This is achieved by a programme unit of the kind set forth, which in accordance with the invention is characterized by a punched card reading unit for reading a punched card having a programme encoded the rein in the form of a configuration of punched holes in preselected positions of an array. The invention has furthermore for its object to provide a programme unit of said type in which copies of the programmes that can be readily interpreted visually are always avatiable. To this end the invention provides in a further embodiment a programme unit in which at least part of said array is rectangular, one direction corresponding to time and the other direction to the value of the quantity to be set so that the configuration of the punched holes constitutes a graph of the programme concerned. Of practical use is the embodiment in which the preselected time interval is a day and in which a plurality of positions corresponding each to a time interval is present in the longitudinal direction of the punched card and a plurality of positions, each corresponding to a range of values of the magnitude to be set is present in the transverse direction. The number of positions in the longitudinal direction may be 24, in which case the time intervals corresponding to the longitudinal direction each have the duration df one hour. However, any other suitable number, for example 48, may be used. In this case the time intervals each have a duration of half an hour.In accordance with the intended use a more or less refined subdivision may be preferred. The number of positions in the transverse direction may be 7, corresponding in a given embodiment, for example, to a temperature of 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230 and 24 C.24 C. In a further embodiment, in the absence of a punched hole a preselected value of the quantity to be set is selected in a position row corresponding to a time interval on a punched card. This preselected value may, for example, be the night temperature of a central heating system. The invention furthermore provides a punched card for use in a programme unit according to the invention, which may be provided with the desired programme data when manufactured, but in accordance with the invention it is preferred to provide all punched holes with a filling that can be manually pressed out, since in this case a user can set any desired programme in a simple manner. Such a punched card may have potential punched holes in the form of squeezed in weakened edges or else a comparatively weak layer, for example, an aluminium foil covering a card in which a complete punched hole array is provided. Further features and particular aspects of the invention will be mentioned and explained with reference to the drawing of an embodiment of a punched card according to the invention. The punched card 1 has an array 2 of potential punched holes indicated by broken lines. In this embodiment a number thereof are realised. These real punched holes are indicated by solid lines. The array 2 is divided into three parts The middle part 3 constitutes the programme proper in the form of real punched holes in the longitudinal direction 24 positions are available in the array, each of which corresponds to one hour in the transverse direction 7 positions are available, each corresponding to a step of 10 C the Figure clearly shows that the visual impression of the punched card constitutes a reproduction of the variation in time of the physical quantity, in this case the temperature. The left hand part 4 is a day compartment and has seven punched holes corresponding to the days of a week during which the programme contained in part 2 has to be operative. Finally, the right hand part 5 has a number of potential punched holes for setting the above mentioned, preselected value of the magnitude which is selected when one of the value columns does not exhibit a real punched hole. The upper row of realised punched holes has the function of parity checking elements. In the embodiment shown the punched holes in part 4 correspond from bottom to top to Saturday, Sunday, Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. The punched holes are realised for Monday to Friday. Therefore, the programme in part 3 is operative for the entire period of consecutive time intervals. In this embodiment the punched holes in part 5 correspond from bottom to top to a temperature setting of 6 , 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 and 180 C, respectively, Therefore, these values correspond to the temperatures to which is switched over in the absence of a.punched hole in a time interval column in the medium part 3. In the embodiment shown the punched hole corresponding to 140 C is realised in part 5. The array lines in the transverse.direction in the middle part 3 correspond to central instants at 4, 5 ... 2 oDclock. It will be seen that the beginning and the end correspond to 3 otclock. From the graph of the programme in the form of the realised punched holes the following variation of temperature with time can be s.imply derived 22 to 7 h 140 C corresponding to the real punched hole in part 5 7 to 11 180 C 11 to 17 190 C 17 to 22 200 C. It will be obvious that a programme unit for a plurality of quantities lies within the scope of the invention. It may, for example, be employed inan air conditioning system for controlling both the temperature and the humidity in a closed space. In this case the array part 3 intended for the programme may be subdivided into a plurality of further parts. By applying the invention the punched card need only be reintroduced into the punched card reading unit after any failure of the mains voltage, so that no expensive, non volatile memory is.required, since the programme as such is available as a hard copy in the form of the punched card. It should be noted that the punched card reading unit may be of a type known per se mecano electric, opto electric .
