# Process for selectively generating positive and negative resist patterns from a single exposure pattern.

## Abstract
A resist pattern having either positive or negative correspondence to a single exposure pattern is produced in the following manner. The surface of a two layer 12, 14 resist structure on a substrate 10 is exposed to radiation and development to remove portions 16 of the outer resist layer 14 . A surface region 18A, 18B of the remaining resist structure is doped with an ultraviolet radiation absorbing dopant material. Depending on whether a final resist pattern bearing a positive or negative correspondence to the single exposure pattern is desired, either the doped portions 18B of the lower resist layer 12 or the whole of the upper resist layer 14 is removed. The remaining structure is then flood exposed to ultraviolet radiation and developed to remove resist material unprotected by the dopant material.

## Description
PROCESS FOR SELECTIVELY GENERATING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RESIST PATTERNS FROM A SINGLE EXPOSURE PATTERN This invention relates to methods of forming resist patterns on a substrate by photo lithographic techniques, and more particularly to forming resist patterns on a substrate by exposing a radiation sensitive resist structure to such radiation and then selectively removing the resist by etching or developing. It is well established that either positive or negative resists can be employed to create etch masks for the formation of corresponding patterns on a substrate. However, a process wherein either a positive or negative resist pattern is obtained by a single exposure step is not available in the prior art. In the present invention, the process described includes a step of doping, that is, introducing impurities into, a resist to alter the spectral absorption characteristics of the resist. In a publication byE. Bassous, L.H. Kaplan and B.J. Lin in the IBM Technical DisclosureBulletin, Volume 23, No. 7B, December 1980 on page 3387, the use of an absorptive additive in photoresists to cause them to become opaque in the deep ultraviolet W light region is described. More particularly, the publication discusses the addition of an absorber such as acridine and its derivatives to resists to make the resist very useful for high resolution deep W lithography. The present invention employs a similar step of adding an absorber to a photoresist, however, it differs in that the absorber is introduced into a thin region of an exposed resist. The invention seeks to provide a process for forming a resist pattern having either positive or negative correspondence to a single exposure pattern. Thus, in accordance with the invention, a method for creating a resist pattern on a substrate comprises the steps of forming a structure composed of the substrate, a first resist layer of ultraviolet radiation sensitive material on the substrate and a second resist layer of radiation sensitive resist material on the first resist layer, exposing the second resist layer to a pattern of radiation and developing the second resist layer to produce a first pattern of material consisting of the remaining portions of the second resist layer on the surface of the first resist layer, introducing an ultraviolet radiation absorbing dopant material into a surface region of the uncovered portions of the first resist layer and the remaining portions of the second resist layer, either removing the doped surface region of the uncovered portions of the first resist layer or entirely removing the second resist layer, and flood exposing the surface of the remaining structure to ultraviolet radiation and developing to create a resist pattern formed of the portions of said first resist layer covered by a surface region into which said ultraviolet radiation absorbing dopant material had been introduced. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic cross section of part of a substrate supporting exposed and developed resist layers. FIGS. 2A and 3A illustrate how the structure of FIG. 1 may be processed to form a positive pattern and FIGS 2B and 3B illustrate how the structure of FIG. 1 may be processed to form a negative pattern. Photo lithographic technology is widely used in the formation of circuit configurations on semiconductor chips or substrates. A circuit configuration is produced from a pattern formed in a radiation sensitive resist layer, by exposing the resist layer to optical or electron beam radiation and then developing the resist layer to remove selected portions of it. The remaining portion of the resist layer on the substrate is then employed as an etching mask. Normally, there are two types of resist positive and negative. When exposed to radiation and developed, the exposed positive resist is stripped away leaving a positive pattern whereas for a similar exposure on negative resist, the exposed negative resist hardens in development and remains, forming a negative pattern of the original exposure on the substrate.Thus, for a single exposure, one type of pattern, negative or positive, will result depending on the type of resist employed. The present invention is concerned with a process using doping materials in combination with a two layer resist structure such that after a single exposure in a predetermined pattern, either a positive or a negative version of the exposure pattern may be obtained as desired. Referring to FIG. 1, a substrate 10 is coated with a first layer 12 of resist which is sensitive to ultraviolet UV light, preferably in the low wavelength region below 300 nanometers. An example of such a resist is polymethyl methacrylate PMMA . A second resist layer 14 is coated over the layer 12. Layer 14 may be composed of positive acting photoresist which is optically sensitive to a different region of the spectrum to that of the resist layer 12, such as sensitized novolak based resist which is sensitive above 300 nanometers. Layer 14 may also be an electron beam sensitive resist layer. It should be noted that layer 12 is relatively thick and serves to planarize the surface of substrate 10, thereby permitting layer 14 to be relatively thin. Thus, a two layer resist structure is provided wherein one resist layer is sensitive to low wavelengths, for example, in a particular embodiment below 300 nanometers and the other layer is sensitive to higher wavelengths which may be above 300 nanometers. The upper surface of the structure i.e., layer 14 is then exposed to electron beam or visible radiation depending on the resist employed , using a suitable mask or by a controlled beam to form a desired exposure pattern and then developed to remove portions 16 of layer 14 to form a patterned layer. Next, the entire surface of the structure including both the upper, patterned resist layer 14, and the lower, thicker layer 12, are doped by the introduction, such as by diffusion, of ultraviolet absorbers. It is known from the previously mentioned Bassous et al publication that the introduction of dopant impurities will alter the spectral characteristics of a region of a resist film in high resolution photo lithographic processes. Such dopants are materials which absorb ultraviolet radiation in regions of the spectrum in which the resists are sensitive. Because of their high W absorption, very small amounts of impurities introduced into a resist film produce large changes in the film s transmission spectrum without significantly affecting the resist s other properties such as solubility, adhesion, and etch resistance. Examples of W absorbers which are potentially useful as resist dopants are naphthalene, anthracene, 9, 10 dibromoanthracene, acridine, phthalazine and phenazine. These organic compounds are readily available commercially and possess stable properties. If the introduction of the dopants into the resist layers of FIG. 1 is by diffusion, the diffusion of the structure may be performed in the vapor phase at a relatively low temperature inside a closed chamber containing one or more dopants. Doping from liquid solutions can also be used, but might be less attractive than doping from the vapor phase because the resist film is subjected to the influence of the solvent which might not be desirable in some applications. Thus, an exposed, developed patterned structure incorporating a diffused W absorbing layer 18A, 18B is provided as shown in FIG. 1.This structure, having had only a single exposure to a predetermined pattern, may be used to provide either a positive or negative version of the exposure pattern as desired. If a positive version of the pattern is desired, the doped region 18B of the layer 12 is removed at a much faster rate than layer 14 by reactive ion etching, plasma etching or the like to provide the structure illustrated in FIG. 2A. The upper surface of structure ofFIG. 2A is then flood exposed by deep W radiation. Deep W radiation, for example, is radiation in the 200 to 300 nanometer wavelength range which is used to flood or totally cover the structure of FIG. 2A The lower resist layer 12, being composed of material sensitive to wavelength s below 300 nanometers, will be sensitized by the deep W radiation. It is the function of the doped regions of layer 14 completely to block the deep W radiation. In the positive pattern case of FIG. 2A, the deep W radiation is also blocked in part by the presence of the non doped portion of layer 14 which is sensitive to wavelengths above 300 nanometers, as well as by the doped portion. In view of the presence of the non doped resist layer 14, acridine or anthracene alone, for example, may be used as the dopant material.If, on the other hand, an extremely thin resist layer 14 is used, which is possible and desirable for high resolution lithography, then the non doped portion of layer 14 may be transmissive to the deep IN flood radiation and stronger dopants may be required such as used in the case of obtaining a negative pattern described hereinbelow. After the flood exposure of the structure of FIG. 2A to the deep IN radiation, the sensitized region of layer 12 which is not located under the doped portions of layer 14 is developed and removed, leaving the regions under the doped portions of layer 14 on the substrate 10 as shown in FIG. 3A, thereby providing a positive version of the original exposure pattern. On the other hand, if a negative pattern is desired, the layer 14 of FIG. 1 is removed by selective solvents or developers to provide the structure illustrated in FIG. 2B, where only layer 12 remains on the substrate 10. The structure of FIG. 2B is exposed to deep W radiation just as in the case of FIG. 2A, and then developed. Only the material under the doped region of layer 12 which is opaque to the W radiation will remain on the substrate 10 to provide the patterned structure illustrated in FIG. 3B which is the negative version of the original exposure pattern. It should be noted that in FIG 2B, there is no extra layer of resist material sensitive to higher IN wavelengths disposed under the doped region, as was the case for FIG. 2A. Thus, all the blockage of the deep W radiation must be by the doped region alone. Thus, an example of dopants suitable for the case of FIG. 2B would be a mixture of napthalene and acridine, which possess strong absorption bands at 220 nanometers and 250 nanometers respectively which are regions of the spectrum to which PMMA is most sensitive. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the positive and negative patterns shown in the illustrations of FIGS 3A and 3B are very simple for purposes of explanation, and that the described process may be used to create more complex image patterns for microcircuitry applications. Among other advantages over the prior art, in the described process the imaging resist employed does not have to be opaque to deep IN since it is subsequently doped, and, for the same reason, a much thinner imaging layer may be used. Furthermore, as previously stated, either positive or negative versions of a pattern can be delineated from the same pattern exposure step, such pattern exposure step using actinic, electron beam or X ray radiation onto a first resist layer, followed by a doping step and flood exposure of a second resist layer. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the materials mentioned as suitable for resists and dopants and the wavelengths and other specific values set forth are for purposes of explanation, and that other suitable equivalents and ranges may also be employed in carrying out the described invention. There has been described a process which is particularly well suited for providing positive or negative patterns from the same image exposure over topographically structured surfaces as typically encountered in VLSI fabrication.
