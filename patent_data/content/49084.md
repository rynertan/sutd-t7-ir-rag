# Window blind fixing device.

## Abstract
To support the normally freely hanging lower end of the blind for preventing intruders gaining access through the win dow opening, the cross bar 10 at the lower end of the blind is fitted with spigots 13 which fit into brackets 18, 21 mounted on the window surround. At least one of the brackets 21 has an opening 20 for a spigot 13 to which access is gained through a slot 25 . The slot is closed up by a screw 29 to se cure the spigot in the opening. The other spigot 13 may be located in a simple opening 17 in another bracket 18 . After fixing the cross bar is still free to pivot in the bracket. In particular the device is usable with Venetian blinds.

## Description
WINDOW BLIND FIXING DEVICEThis invention relates to a device for fixing window blinds and in particular window blinds known as Venetian blinds and roller blinds.In the usual Venetian or roller blind the lower end of the blind hangs freely from its upper end. Consequently the blind can swing freely about its upper end and this can cause problems especially if the blind is against an open window and draught causes the blind to swing across the window ledge. Moreover with the lower end of the blind able to move freely the blind provides no obstacle to intruders trying to gain unauthorised access through the window.An object of the invention is to provide a device for securing the lower ends of window blinds.According to the invention a fixing device for window blinds comprises a pair of brackets each arranged to be fixed to part of a window surround in which a window blind is located, the window blind having a cross bar at its lower end and the brackets being arranged at opposite ends of the cross bar and locking means for releasably securing the ends of the cross bar to the brackets whereby the lower end of the blind is secured in the window surround.Preferably the locking means includes a spigot on each end of the cross bar which spigot is engageable in an opening in a bracket, the cross bar being rotatable about the axes of the spigots when secured to the brackets.Conveniently in at least one of the brackets the opening for the spigot is formed to receive the spigot through a side of the opening and closure means is provided on the brackets for locking the spigot into the opening In an embodiment access of the spigot to the opening is through a slot and the closure means secures the spigot in the opening by drawing together the sides of the slot.Further features of the invention will appear from the following description of an embodiment of the invention given by way of example only and with reference to the drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a blind to which the fixing device is fitted, with the brackets shown in section,Fig. 2 is an end elevation of one of the brackets of the fixing device, andFig. 3 is an end elevation of the other bracket of the fixing device.Referring to the drawings a Venetian blind, only the lower end of which is shown, has a lower cross bar 10 at opposite ends of which are end pieces 11 which are cup shaped and usually formed of plastics. The end pieces are removable and central openings are formed in the end pieces through which are inserted spigot members 12.The spigot members 12 at opposite ends of the bar 10 are the same and each consists of an integral plastics moulding having at one end a cylindrical spigot 13, a flange 14 adjacent the spigot and, at the opposite end to the spigot, a circular section portion 15 with annular projections. Around the portion 15 a locking member 16 is located as a push fit to fix the member 12 in the opening in the end piece 11.The spigots 13 project outwardly of the ends of the bar 10 and one of the spigots is insertable endwise into a circular opening 17 in a bracket 18 Figs. 1 and 3 . The spigot 13 at the opposite end of the bar fits into an opening 20 in a bracket 21 Figs. 1 and 2 which is of different form from the bracket 18.Each of the brackets 18 and 21 has a flanged base 22 with openings through which screws 23 are inserted to screw the brackets to the window ledge 24 or other part of the window surround in which the blind is fitted. The body of each bracket is upstanding from the base 22.In the case of bracket 21 access of the spigot 13 to the opening 20 is through a divergent slot 25. Entry into the slot 25 is at the side of the opening 20 and the spigot is pushed down between the sides of the slot 25 until it enters the opening 20.The slot continues past the opening 20 and enters a further opening 27 formed in the bracket 21.A screw opening 28 for a screw 29 intersects the slot 25 at the side of the spigot opening 20 remote from the slot entry and as the screw 29 having a head 30 is screwed up in a threaded portion 28A of the opening the sides of the slot 25 are drawn together to prevent the spigot from being withdrawn from the opening 20. By this means the cross bar is securely located by the brackets 18 and 21 and release of the bar can only be effected by releasing the screw 29 from the bracket 21. However the cross bar is still able to rotate relative to the brackets due to the movement of the spigots about their axes in the respective openings in the brackets. It will be appreciated that the head 30 of the screw 29 is directed away from the window so that it is easily released from within the room but is not easily reached by an intruder from the window side of the blind. The head 30 is provided with a socket 31 for receiving a turning tool. If necessary packing pieces may be located under the brackets in the case where the bar is too far from the ledge for the ends to be secured in the brackets.It will be appreciated that when the device is used for roller blinds there is no necessity for the cross bar to be able to rotate when the device is installed. Consequently a modified form of spigot and bracket arrangement may be utilised in which the cross bar is locked against such rotational movement.
