# Ascorbate resistant broad range glucose test composition, test device and method.

## Abstract
A composition, test device and method for detecting the presence and or determining concentration of glucose in a liquid test sample are disclosed. The composition is capable of determining glucose concentration over a broad range, e.g. 0 to about 5,000 milligrams mg of glucose per deciliter d1 of test sample. Moreover, the composition is resistant to interference from the presence of ascorbate in the sample. The composition comprises glucose oxidase, peroxidase and, as an indicator capable of producing a detectable response in the presence of peroxidase and H₂O₂, a mixture of two compounds. One has the structure
