# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WITH IMAGINARY BASE REGION

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes a semiconductor subs trate 11 having a semi insulating property, a first region 12 of one conductivity type which will become an emitter region, a second region 13 of the one conductivity type which will become a collector region, the first and second regions 12, 13 being formed on the substrate 11 with a predetermined spacing therebetween, and a third region 14 of another conductity type formed on the substrate 11 between the first and second regions 12, 13 . A forward biasing voltage is applied between the third and first regions 14, 12 thereby to form an imaginary base region 19 in the substrate 11 beneath the third region 141 by majority carriers implanted or injected from the third region 14 , whereby the semiconductor device carries out a bipolar transistor operation, and at least one of the first and third regions 12, 14 consists of a plurality of regions.
