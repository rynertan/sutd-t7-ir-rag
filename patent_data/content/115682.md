# Resonant magnetic deflection circuit.

## Abstract
A resonant magnetic deflection circuit is disclosed for reducing a retrace period of an electron beam scanning within a cathode ray tube CRT apparatus. Opposite polar ity flyback voltage pulses occur at both ends of a deflection coil 14 . As a result, an effective retrace voltage appearing across the deflection coil 14 is approximately doubled, thereby reducing the retrace period of the electron beam scanning within the CRT apparatus. One end of the deflec tion coil is connected to a reference level source through a first parallel circuit 12, 18, 20 and an S correction capacitor 10 , the other end thereof being connected to the reference level source through a second parallel circuit 16, 22, 24 . The first and second parallel circuits 12, 18, 20 and 16, 22, 24 comprise switching devices 12, 16 , damper diodes 18, 22 and retrace capacitors 20, 24 . Moreover, both ends of the deflection coil 14 are connected to a power supply V through a flyback transformer 28 .
