# Hydrocarbon prospecting method for the indirect detection of hydrocarbon reservoirs.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for electromagnetic hydrocar bon exploration which is accomplished by implanting at least two pairs 10,15 of electrodes into the ground. One pair 10 and 6 transmits a signal into the earth, and the other pair 15 and 6 receives the signal. With proper processing the polar ization and resistivity of the ground can be calculated. The components 11, 16 are arranged in a manner to insure that the electromagnetic coupling can be determined and can be removed from the measurements. Electrode spacing can be varied to focus on the anomalous stratum. If an anomalous ratum is discovered, it is cored to determine the nature of the material creating the anomaly.
