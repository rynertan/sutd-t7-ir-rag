## Abstract
A helicopter 10 incorporates apparatus 15 for mount ing a device such as an aerial or a sight 14 above a main sustaining rotor 13 . The apparatus comprises first and second ring gears 16, 20 located respectively above and below the rotor, the first gear 16 being supported from helicopter structure 17 concentrically of an axis of rotation 11 of the sustaining rotor, support means 37 supporting the second gear and the device above the rotor in a manner permitting relative rotation of the rotor hub, and synchronis ing means 25 rotationally fixed to the rotor hub and meshing with the first and second gears to retain the device stationary during rotation of the rotor system. In a preferred embodiment, positioning means are provided to rotate the first gear in either direction of rotation whereby the device can be rotated and selectively positioned independently of the rotation of the rotor.
