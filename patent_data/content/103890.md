# A fastening for a garment.

## Abstract
A fastening for use on a garment comprises a base 16 , and at least two flat spikes 13, 13 initially projecting from the base 12 for being pierced through the garment into apertures 15a of a hasp 15 , and then for being deflected into a clenched condition against the hasp 15 , there being at least two cold pressed grooves 16, 16 each opening into an outer surface of the fastening and extending longitudinal ly thereof across a shoulder or joint 17 between the base 12 and a respective one of the spikes 13 . The fastening accordingly has a greater hardness in a region around the grooves 16 than at other regions thereof so that the fastening is resistant to bending or other deformation around the grooves 16 when the spikes 13 are pierced and clenched.
