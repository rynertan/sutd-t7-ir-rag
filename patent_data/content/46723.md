# Isomerization of jojoba oil, products thereof and resultant compositions.

## Abstract
A process for isomerization of natural jojoba oil, a wax type ester is based on contacting jojoba oil, essentially all cis configuration with an acidic bentonite type clay at temperatures in the range 150 350 C. The resulting isomer ates, predominately of trans configuration have melting points in the range 25 to about 44 C. Also included are useful isomorphous compositions of the trans isomerates of jojoba oil with hydrogenated jojoba oil. These compositions are useful as candle waxes, non stick cooking sprays, cosmetic vehicles, carriers for solid detergent soaps, lether treatments, hand modifiers for textiles including both woven and non woven fabrics.
