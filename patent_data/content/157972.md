# PIPE JOINT COATING APPLICATOR

## Abstract
An applicator is provided for coating the uncovered end portions or stubs of pipe sections after they have been welded together. A belt is maintained in tension out of con tact with the pipe until the pipe stubs are welded together and coating operations are to begin. The belt is then wrapped onto the pipes forming an annular cavity about the welded stubs. Chain reinforcing mesh is also applied to the exterior of the belt for support. An expanding foam which sets into a hard coating is then injected into the cavity. Once the foam hardens and fills the cavity, the belt and reinforcement are unwrapped from the coated joint and moved away from the pipe.
