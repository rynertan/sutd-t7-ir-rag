# Self erecting telescopable structure.

## Abstract
A telescopable structure is disclosed which comprises a plurality of cuplike component parts 1, 2, 3, 4 which are inserted each in its next when the structure is collapsed linkage means 6,7,8,9,10 are provided in correspondence with the top edges of the cuplike component parts so that by displacing the connection pins of such linkage means, the several cuplike component parts can be lifted individually and in sequence, after having actuated a lifting jack 11,12,13 which is connected at its ends 12,13 to the innermost component part 4 and to its next component part 3 . As soon as the reaction of the structure proceeds, the component parts which are nearer the base of the structure 1,2 can be fixed in their position by means of bolted angular irons 15,17 . The reverse operation is effected to disassemble the structure by collapsing the hydraulic jack 11 and slipping the component parts into each other.
