# Improvements relating to fasteners.

## Abstract
A fastener for securing a sink unit in a worktop has a clip 11 for attachment to a rail and a hinged clamping member 12 which is tightened up against the underside of the worktop by a screw 25 . This threads through the hinge pin 13 , and when undone allows the clamping member to swing back to and stay in an inoperative position where it will clear the edge of the hole of the worktop 19 as the unit 20 is lowered in. Doing up the screw causes the clamping member to swing and project a portion 21 under the worktop. The clamping mem ber has guide fingers 23 which engage diametral slots 24 in the ends of the hinge pin.
