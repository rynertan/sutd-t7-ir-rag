# A clamping device for filing loose sheets.

## Abstract
A clamping device for filing loose sheets, which device comprises a body 1 having a substantially U shaped cross section. The legs of the U may be separated in an elastically yielding manner and thereby be placed around e.g. a stack of paper and form the back of the resulting book. The body 1 has an appendage 2 facing away from the open end of the U, in which appendage holes 3 are formed to receive e.g. the rings of a ring file. Preferably, the appendage has extending hooks 4 at both ends. In the hooks notches 5 are formed to be placed on e.g. the guide rails of an archive cabinet.

## Description
A CLAMPING DEVICE FOR FILING LOOSE SHEETS The invention relates to a clamping device for filing loose sheets, which device is of the kind comprising a body having a substantially U shaped cross section, wherein the legs of the U may be separated in an elastically yielding manner. U For a long time it has been known to use such clamping devices in cohnection with systematic filing of loose paper sheets, the yielding clamping device being pressed around a number of paper sheets arranged in a stack. When the clamping device is placed around the paper sheets these are held securely without any danger of some of the sheets being unin tentionably removed from the stack. However, the known clamping devices cannot be placed in a file in any other way than stacking them loosely upon each other. The purpose of the invention is to improve and further develop the known clamping devices in such a manner that it is possible to place them in, for example, a ring file. According to the invention this purpose is achieved by means of a clamping device of the kind mentioned in the introduction and characterized in that the body has an appendage facing away from the open end of the U, in which appendage holes are formed for receiving, e.g., the rings of ring files. Thus, by this simple measure it is ensured that the clamping devices may be placed in a ring file in the same manner as plastic pockets having a standardized perforation at the left side. In a possible embodiment of a clamping device of the invention the appendage has extending hooks at both ends, in which hooks notches are formed to be placed on, e.g., the guide rails of archive cabinets. Hereby another field of application of the clamping device is achieved, as it may either be placed on the guide rails of an archive cabinet and serve as suspension device for the paper sheets placed in the clamping device, or it may be placed in a ring file, or both. In the following, the invention will be further explained with reference to the drawing, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a first embodiment of a clamping device of the invention, Figure 2 is a second embodiment of a clamping device of the invention, and Figure 3 is a cross section through a clamping device according to claim 1. The clamping device for filing loose sheets shown inFigure 1 comprises a body 1 having a substantially U shaped cross section and an appendage 2 facing away from the open end of the U, in which appendage holes 3 are formed for re ceiving, e.g., the rings of a ring file. The legs of the clamping device are formed in such a manner that at the open end of the U an appropriately small opening has been provided so that the desired clamping effect for a certain amount of paper is achieved. The holes 3 of the appendage are placed at such mutual intervals and have been given such a form that the clamping device will be capable of being placed in any standardized ring file system. In the embodiment shown in Figure 2 the appendage of the clamping device is prolonged by two extending hooks 4, wherein notches 5 are formed in order that the clamping device may be placed on e.g, the guide rails of an archive cabinet. The distance between the two above metioned notches 5 may naturally be adapted to archive cabinets for filing common sizes of sheets, including folio andDIN A4. A clamping device of the invention may be shaped of any suitable material, but in practice a thermoplastic ma trial is preferred, and the clamping device is produced either by die casting or by extrusion. The invention is not limited to exactly those features shown and described, and it should especially be noted that it will be within the scope of the invention to frame the appendage without the holes designed to receive the rings of a ring file, but with the hooks 4 extending at the ends of the appendage.
