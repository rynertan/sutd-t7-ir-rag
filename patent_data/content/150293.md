## Description
This invention relates to a substrate for use in optical recording media in which recording and reproduction of information are carried out by the reflection or transmission of laser beams. More specifically, the invention relates to a substrate for optical recording media, which has excellent trasparency, moisture resistance, moldability and heat resistance and being free from birefringence. The optical recording media typically comprise a flat substrate and formed on at least one surface thereof, rows of minute depressions, or helically or concentrically extending pre grooves and a recording layer on the pregrooves. Laser beams are focused on the minute depressions or the recording layer. The reflected or transmitted light is read and the information is reproduced. Such optical recording media have been used as video discs, audio discs, document disc files, computer information disc files, etc. Generally, a poly methyl methacrylate type resin or a polycarbonate type resin is used as a substrate for the optical recording media because of its requirement for transparency. The poly methyl methacrylate resin has excellent moldability and strength, but inferior moisture resistance.At high temperatures and humidities, therefore, molded articles from it undergo warping, or develop cracks while they repeatedly absorb moisture and dry. Moreover, their impact strength is reduced. Japanese Laid Open PatentPublications Nos. 5354 1983 and 13652 1983 disclose resins having improved moisture resistance obtained by copolymerizing several kinds of monomers such as methacrylates, styrene and cyclohexane methacrylate. However, so long as their major component is polymethacrylate, they have still unsatisfactory moisture resistance. The polycarbonate type resin, on the other hand, has low surface hardness and is susceptible to injury. In addition, it has poor moldability, and because the orientation during molding remains in the molded articles, the articles have great birefringence, and therefore cannot be used for large storage capacity image type discs, large storage capacity document discs, and large storage capacity computer discs. Other resins having excellent transparency have a high birefringence, and are unsuitable for use in such discs. It is an object of this invention therefore to provide a substrate for optical recording media, which eliminates the foresaid defects of the prior art, and can be used in optical discs of the large storage capacity recording type. Another object of this invention is to provide a substrate for optical recording media, which has excellent transparency, moldability and moisture resistance and is free from birefringence. Still another object of this invention is to provide a substrate for optical recording media, which has excellent heat resistance. According to this invention, there is provided a substrate for optical recording media, said substrate being composed of a polyvinylacetal resin resulting from acetalization of polyvinylalcohol to a degree of at least 60 mole with at least one acetalizing agent selected from the group consisting of aliphatic aldehydes, alicyclic aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes and heterocyclic aldehydes. The present invention is based on the inventors discovery that a resin having excellent moisture resistance can be obtained by increasing the degree of acetalization of a polyvinylacetal resin having high transparency, and that a resin having excellent heat resistance can be obtained by selecting the type of an aldehyde to be used in acetalization. The polyvinylacetal resin is obtained by acetalizing polyvinylalcohol with an aldehyde in the presence of an acid catalyst. If the degree of acetalization is low, the resulting polyvinylacetal resin has high hygroscopicity because of the remaining hydroxyl groups. The polyvinylacetal resin forming the substrate of this invention has excellent moisture resistance because it has a degree of acetalization of at least 60 mole , preferably at least 65 mole . To obtain such a polyvinylacetal resin, the starting polyvinylalcohol preferably has a high purity. The polyvinylalcohol has a degree of saponification of at least 80 mole , preferably at least 95 mole .In other words, it has not more than 20 moles , preferably not more than 5 mole , of residual acetyl groups. If the percentage of the residual acetyl groups is high, the transparency of the resulting polyvinylacetal resin is undesirably reduced. The polyvinylalcohol has a degree of polymerization of 100 to 2,500, preferably 300 to 1,500.If its degree of polymerization is below 100, the resulting polyvinylacetal resin has drasticallly reduced impact strength and cannot withstand practical use. Furthermore, its heat resistance and moisture resistance tend to be degraded. If, on the other hand, its degree of polymerization exceeds 2,500, an injection molded article prepared from the resulting polyvinylacetal resin undesirably has great birefringence. Primarily, an aliphatic aldehyde is used as an acetalizing agent for the polyvinylalcohol. To increase the heat resistance of the polyvinylacetal resin further, an alicyclic aldehyde, an aromatic aldehyde or a heterocyclic aldehyde is used as part or the whole of the acetalizing agent. Examples of the aliphatic aldehydes include formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propylaldehyde, n butylaldehyde, isobutylaldedhyde, decylaldehyde, and dodecylaldehyde. These aldehydes may be used singly or in combination. Examples of the alicyclic aldehydes include saturated aldehydes such as cyclohexanealdehyde, trimethylcyclohexanealdehyde, dimethylcyclohexanealdehyde, methyl cyclohexanealdehyde, cyclopentanealdehyde, methylcyclopentanealdehyde, decahydro beta naphthaldehyde and cyclohexaneacetaldehyde terpene type aldehydes such as alphacamphorenealdehyde, phellandral, cyclocitral, trimethyltetrahydrobenzaldehyde, alpha pyrronenealdehyde, myrtenal, dihydromyrtenal and camphenilanealdehyde and unsaturated aldehydes such as 4 methylcyclohexenealdehyde and 3 methylcyclohexenealdehyde. Examples of the aromatic aldehyde include benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, phenylpropylaldehyde, tolualdehyde, dimethylbenzaldehyde, cumenealdehyde, and naphthylaldehyde. Examples of the heterocyclic aldehydes are aldehydes having a furane ring such as furfural and 5 methylfurfural. The above alicyclic, aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes may respectively be used singly or in combination. When the alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic aldehyde is used as the acetalizing agent, it should be added in an amount sufficient to acetalize at least 5 mole of the polyvinylalcohol. If it is less than 5 moles, sufficient heat resistance cannot be obtained. The acetalizing agent may be composed only of the alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic aldehyde. The polyvinylacetal resin may be prepared by an ordinary method such as the dissolving method, the homogeneous method or the precipitaton method. Or it may be prepared by saponifying polyvinylacetate and subsequently acetalizing the resulting product. The polyvinylacetal resin so prepared is molded by ordinary methods such as injection molding or compression molding. As required, ordinary additives such as age resistors, antioxidants, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers and lubricants may be used in the molding process. Since the substrate in accordance with this invention is composed of the polyvinylacetal resin having such a high degree of acetalization, it has excellent moisture resistance, and therefore does not undergo warpage or strain during storage. Furthermore, because the resin has excellent moldability, fine pits of a stamper and pre grooves can be reproduced, and the strain or orientation during molding does not remain. For this reason, erroneous recording or reading of information does not occur. The substrate of this invention is applicable to a wide range of optical recording media including large storage capacity image type discs, large storage document discs, and large storage capacity computer discs. The use of the alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic aldehyde for the acetalization brings about the advantage that the substrate obtained also has excellent heat resistance. The following examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. EXAMPLE 1 A Preparation of polyvinylacetal One hundred grams of polyvinylalcohol having a degree of saponification of 99.2 mole and a degree of polymerization of 2,200 was dissolved in 880 g of distilled water, and 57 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added. While the mixture was maintained at 14.40C, 57.3 g of isobutylaldehyde was added dropwise over 15 minutes.Ten minutes after the addition, polyvinylbutyral precipitated. This reaction system was heated and maintained at 400C for 10 hours. The temperature was then lowered, and it was neutralized with sodium bicarbonate. The resulting polyvinylbutyral was washed with water, and dried at 70 0C for 48 hours. The degree of acetalization of this resin was measured. B Molding of the polyvinylacetal resin and evalu ation of its properties The resin obtained as described in section A was injection molded at a cylinder temperature of 195 0C and 0 a molding temperature of 60 C. The warpage after water absorption, percentage water absorption, total light transmittance, haze value and birefringence of the resulting injection molded plate 1.2 mm x 120 mm x 120 mm were measured by the methods shown below. The results obtained in Examples 1 to 8 andComparative Example I are summarized in Table 1. 1 Warpage after water absorption Aluminum was vapor deposited on one surface of the molded plate, and a protective coating was further applied to shut off intrusion of water from the vaporeposited layer. This sample was immersed in water at 20 C, and its warpage at the central portion was measured 72 hours later. 2 Water absorption The molded plate not subjected to the vapor deposition treatment was immersed in water at 20 C, and the weight of the sample after 72 hours was measured. The percentage of an increase in weight was calculated. 3 Total light transmitance Measured in accordance with the method of ASTMD 1003. 4 Haze value Measured in accordance with the method of ASTMD 1003. 5 Presence or absence of birefringence The molded plate not subjected to the vapor deposition treatment was interposed between two polarizing plates. Visible light was transmitted through it, and the presence or absence of birefringence was examined by observing the interference fringe. 6 Degree of acetalization Measured in accordance with JIS K 6728, 5.5.2.The same method was used in Examples 2, 6, 8, 16 and 17 in which the acetalization was effected by using a single aldehyde. When two or more aldehydes were used as inExamples 3 to 5, 7, 9 to 15 and 18, the aldehydes were treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to convert them to the corresponding oximes which were quantitatively determined by gas chromatography in accordance with JIS K 6728, 5.5.2. The operating conditions for gas chromatography were as follows Gas chromatoigraphic device GC6AM made by Shimazdu Seisaku Sho, K.K.
