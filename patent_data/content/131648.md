# Method of cold expanding and sizing fastener holes.

## Abstract
The method of fastening a plurality of metal members 82, 84 232, 230 in which precision holes 86, 88 236, 234 are drilled through the metals which are to be connected toget her. The drilled holes in the metal members are cold expanded to improve the fatigue performance of the metal surrounding the hole and at the same time size the hole. Then a fastener 254 sized to make a desired fit is installed into the hole. The final hole diameters 236A, 234A after expansion are equal to the starting hole diameters plus the retained expansions, there being spring back shrinkage of the expan ded holes to the final hole diameter. The holes are sized by expanding them to at least a critical sizing expansion value which is a value of expansion beyond which the retained expansion value is linearly exceeded and to nearly the same amount as the total expansion before elongation of the hole axis of the metal surrounding the hole. This is a method of cold expanding a series of holes to size in which the same tools are used, with the result that the holes are varied in the diameter no more than 0.001 .
