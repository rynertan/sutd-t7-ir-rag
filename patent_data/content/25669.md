# Method of moulding a ceramic article by slip casting.

## Abstract
A ceramic article is electrophoretically slip cast by plac ing an aqueous suspension of a ceramic material in a multi part mould, each part of which has an electrically conductive por ous carbonaceous operative surface conforming to the de sired outside surface of a respective part of the article, the car bonaceous component of the surface region being made of particles of from 70 µm to 200 µm maximum diameter, the parts of the mould being electrically insulated from one anoth er, each part being intermittently made anodic with respect to the suspension, at least one part at any time being cathodic except for possible intervals when no part is anodic . Thus a model horse is made from the mould parts of Figure 4 which are electrically charged in the following sequence, 1 minute each phase and all repeated at least once 41 42 43 44 45 46
