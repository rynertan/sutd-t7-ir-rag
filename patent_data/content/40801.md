# Automatic equalizer.

## Abstract
An automatic equalizer comprises a transversal filter 2 connected to receive an input signal such as a television signal in which a predetermined periodic reference signal is present and having variable tap gains, and a correlator 8 for forming the correlation between the input and output signals of the transversal filter and correcting the tap gains of the transversal filter to cancel out distortion components such as ghost com ponent contained in the input signal. For the purpose of pre venting the slow convergence and fluctuation of tap gains of the transversal filter 2 due to nonperiodic noise components contained in the input signal, a circuit 30 is further provided to integrate a predetermined portion of the waveform of the reference signal contained in the input signal. An output signal of the waveform integrator circuit 30 is correlated with the output signal of the transversal filter 2 by the correlator 8 .
