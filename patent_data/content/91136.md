# A system and a method for bending substantially triangular plane sections of glass.

## Abstract
A system for bending the otherwise plane substantially triangular sections 77 of glass comprising the reflecting surface, wherein each triangular section 77 includes vertices and edges extending between the vertices. The system includes means 79 for supporting the triangular sections 77 at each of its vertices, and means 81 which are positioned along each edge of the triangular sections 77 for applying pressure against that edge, forcing that edge into a configur ation approaching a curve, so that the triangular section 77 as a whole is curved.
