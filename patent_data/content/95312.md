# Process for removal of sealants from surfaces.

## Abstract
Processes for removing contaminating sealants used in the automobile and allied industries from water insoluble surfaces, employing cleaning compositions which are aqueous solutions containing at least one C₅ C₉ alkanoic acid, normally at a concentration of at least 0.8 g l and preferably 2.5 150 g l, above all 8 60 g l, as well as optionally other ingredients, notably at least 0.1 g l and preferably 6 130 g l of alkali metal phosphate or condensed phosphate. Aqueous compositions for use in the processes may be prepared by dilution of 10 25 of aqueous concentrates, usually containing solubility enhancing agents.
