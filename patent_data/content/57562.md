# Manufacture of halogenated ketones and aldehydes and the use of the same as reactants in the production of other products.

## Abstract
A method for the manufacture of commercially useful alpha halo and alpha dihalo ketones and aldehydes from alkynes by enzymatic reaction. The method avoids the use of free halogen, permits control of the ratio of alpha halo product to alpha dihalo product and offers the possibility of economic utilization of coal as a raw feedstock in many industrial applications. In the method an alkyne is acted upon in a reaction mixture also comprising a halogenating enzyme, an oxidising agent, and a halide ion source.
