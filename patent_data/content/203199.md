# INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE WHICH USES A SERVO MOTOR AND WHICH IS PROVIDED WITH A PROTECTING FUNCTION.

## Abstract
An injection molding machine which uses a servo mo tor M as a source for driving a mold fastening mechanism 2 and which is provided with a mold protecting function. An NC control device 4 which drives the servo motor M has a torque limiting function, and limits the torque when it is detected that a predetermined position for protecting the metal mold is reached based upon the output of a position detector P . Further, the NC control device 4 has a display device 10 which displays an alarm when a predetermined period of time has passed after the predetermined position for protecting the metal mold is arrived at but before a predetermined mold touch position is reached.
