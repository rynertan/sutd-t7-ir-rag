# A method of making a photographic exposure from a television picture.

## Abstract
A between lens shutter assembly 14 for photographing devices, comprising at least two, preferably three rotary plates 15, 16, 17 with axes parallel to the axis of the lenses. Each plate 15, 16, 17 comprises an opening 28, 29, 30 . When the plates 15, 16, 17 are rotated at a common speed, the open ings 28, 29, 30 move from evenly distributed directions to wards the inside openings 24 of the lenses, completely un cover it, and then in continued movement close the inside op ening 24 again. In this way identical opening and closing cha racteristics and times are provided. In a method using the shutter assembly 14 exposures are taken from television pictures, in which the length of the exposure period is adjusted to be equal to the period of a tele vison picture T and the duration of either an opening or clos ing section A or B , whereby uniform illumination is ensured for the exposure. The invention is particularly suitable for the precise pho tography of X ray pictures displayed on the screen of a televi sion monitor.
