# Composite piston for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A composite piston 10 for an internal combustion engine has a base structure formed from a fiber reinforced resin material. The base structure has a head 11 a body 12 and a skirt 13 . Covering the head 11 , and integral therewith, is a cap 14 formed of a nonflammable material such as a metal, metal alloy or ceramic. The cap 14 has an annular groove 19 therein cooperating with an annular flange 20 on the head 11 to interlock the two. The cap 14 and head 11 normally have an outer diameter which is less than the outer diameter of the piston body by an amount sufficient to accommodate the difference in thermal coefficients of expansion of the materials of the cap 14 and the base structure.
