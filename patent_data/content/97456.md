# Centrifugal blower wheel and center disc therefor.

## Abstract
A center plate blade attachment configuration for a centrifugal blower wheel which gives improved high speed rupture strength and improved resistance to the center plate slipping circumferentially relative to blades. The inner edge of each blade A is provided with a T shaped notch 30 and the edges of the two discs 14 forming the center plate are forced axially into the slots forming the ends of the head of each T, a distance such that the edges of the disc and the base of the slot are plastically deformed.
