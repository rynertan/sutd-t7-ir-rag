# Locking apparatus of inertial mass drive hydraulic circuit system.

## Abstract
An apparatus 102 104 106 108 110 112 for locking of an inertial mass drive hydraulic circuit system 100 having a hydraulic pump 2 , actuator means 1 driven by the hydraulic pump for driving a relatively large inertial mass, and a directional control valve 4 mounted in line means 5, 12, 13 connecting the hydraulic pump with the actuator means. On off means 34, 35 44, 45 54, 55 64, 65 74, 75 345 is interposed between the actuator means and the hydraulic pump for opening or closing the line means 12, 13 , and means 30, 31, 37 40 51 61, 63 70, 71, 77, 78 is provided for sensing the discharge condition of the hy draulic pump 2 . The sensing means generates a signal for actuating the on off means.
