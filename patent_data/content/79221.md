# Immune complex removal and tumor specific antibody generation by immobilized protein a perfusion and postperfusion drug infusion.

## Abstract
Significantly increased removal of immunal complexes and tumor specific antibody generation are achieved by extracorporeal plasma perfusion over a therapeutic immobilized protein A staphylococcal , SPA. The perfused plasma is returned to the host or can be taken off one person and used to treat another and stored in perfused plasma banks. Immobilized protein A quantities, volumes of plasma perfused and the rate of administration based on clinical and toxicity evaluations are set forth. A non toxic drug infusion, such as cytosine arabinoside, during the immediate postperfusion period obtains an observed tumoricidal response far exceeding those due to the extracorporeal plasma perfusion or drug infusion alone representing an in vivo synergism between tumor specific antibody and the drug. Also disclosed are the therapeutic protein A cartridge, its loading and delivery system, a miniaturized immunoabsorbent apparatus enabling the processing of serum samples for testing small quanitities of plasma, and a radioimmuno assay for detecting and measuring tumor specific antibodies in the serum samples for profiling and screening of patients for treatment and assessment. The United States government has rights in these inventions pursuant to U.S. Public Health Service Grants or Awards 5K04AI00302 and 5R01GM23517.

Therapy for many of these immunologically mediated diseases has consisted largely of the use of pharmacological agents that widely apd non specifically suppress host immunity leading to numerous undesirable effects. With increasing awareness of the eticpatho genic factors in many auto immune diseases many sensitive rsdio immunological techniques to measure them in serum. Various immunoadsorbents designed to extract pathogenic immune reactants from the circulation have been developed. For example, immunoadsorbents consisting of immobilized antigens, antibodies and enzymes have been developed.When placed in an extracorporeal circuit, these immunoadsorbents have shown a capacity to extract or hydrolyze immune reactants in the circulation without demonstrable release of imrnobilized substances or significant immediate or long range toxicity to the host.

Terman et al FEBS, Letters, 68, 89, 1976. Extracorporeal Approaches To Cancer Therapy Protein A is a substance which is a constituent of the cell wall of staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 SPA . It has the capacity to bind the immunoglobulin G egg from most mammalian species and to bind immune complexes. In my studies, I have discovered that when plasma from tumor bearing hosts is perfused over heat killed, formalin fixed SPA which is immobilized in an extracorporeal filtration system, a profound necrotizing tumor killing reaction is observed. Terman et al, Journal Immunology, 8, 80, 1980.I have discovered guidelines for use of protein A for patients of various body weights based on clinical studies and evaluation of toxicity which include immobilized protein A quantity,volumes of plasma perfused and rate of administration, and also the necessity for nonchemical or noncovalent binding of the protein A on a suitable carrier, and preferred loading of the immobilized protein A in a cartridge. In addition, I have discovered that when sera from tumor bearing hosts is perfused over immobilized proteinA in vitro, a profound increase in tumor specific antibodies TSA is observed. Present Invention Hence, this invention is directed to a an extracorporcal system and method for the immobilization of protein A SPA and therapy of patients with cancer b guidelines for SPA volumes, quantities of plasma perfused and rate of administration c loading of the protein A cartridge and its distributions d a system and method of immobilization of protein A which may be employed to process very small quantities of a patient s sera to determine whether it will generate theTSA from bound immune complexes after perfusion over a small quantity of immobilized protein A e the provision of a very sensitive radioimmunoassay RIA for the detection and quantitation of the TSA which are generated as a result of perfusion of plasma over immobilized protein A and f protein A perfused plasma having generated TSA for use by the host or others or storage in a bank for subsequent use. SUD5ARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides significantly improved method and system of removal of immune complexes from circulation of patients with cancer and the generation of tumor specific antibodies TSA . More specifically, one aspect of the present invention is the removal of immune complexes and generation of TSA from the circulation of patients with cancer by the extracorporeal perfusion of plasma over immobilized protein A SPA . The plasma is separated from the whole blood and perfused over SPA nonchemically immobilized on a suitable inert support, preferably adsorbed in a collodion membrane closely adjacent to charcoal particles and not chemically or covalently bound.The perfused plasma may then be recombined with the formed elements into whole blood and the whole blood perfused back into the circulation of the patient or stored for subsequent administration to other patients. Hence plasma may be collected from patients and processed over the immobilized protein A and administered to patients at different times. Thus, in addition, to the extracorporeal one step collection and following approach, plasma may be collected and administered to patients at different times. The present invention includes guidelines for the use of protein A based on clinical and toxicity evaluations to include immobilized protein A quantity, volumes of plasma perfused over immobilized protein A and the rate of administration of plasma perfused over immobilized proteinA and administered to the patient. Another aspect of the present invention is the provision of therapeutic, extracorporeal immobilized protein A as the immunoadsorbent and its manufacture.Preferably, protein A is immobilized in collodion membranes closely adjacent to activated charcoal, although it may be immobilized by other means and on other inert supports, as subsequently described. It is necessary, however, that immobilization or binding of the protein A on the carrier be noncovalent and preferably, the protein A particles should be physically separated from one another in the chamber housing. Another aspect of the present invention is the discovery that a single non toxic drug infusion, such as cytosine arabinoside ARA C ,given intravenously at the conclusion of protein A perfusion results in a profound necrotizing tumoricidal response which far exceeds that due to this extracorporeal plasma perfusion of protein A or drug infusion alone. This appears to represent an in vivo synergism between TSA which are generated in plasma after perfusion over protein A and the drug. The magnitude, rapidity and specificity of the observed tumoricidal response with minimal host toxicity represents a potent and unique chemoimmunotherapeutic approach to breast adenocarcinoma and other carcinomos. A further aspect of the present invention is a miniaturized protein A collodion charcoal frisbee or column by which very small serum samples are processed and their quantity of tumor specific antibodies are assessed. This allows the profiling and screening of patients serum for use in immunoadsorption treatment and is important for the selection of appropriate patients for therapy and an assessment of the patients as treatment continues. A A further aspect of the present invention is a radio immunoassay for measurement of TSA in the serum of patients with cancer before and after perfusion over the large and miniaturized protein A systems which provides an important in vitro test for selection and assessment of patients undergoing immunoadsorbent treatment. A further aspect of the invention is the provision of protein A perfused plasma in which tumor specific antibodies have been generated. Other aspects of the invention appear throughout the specification and claims. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a therapeutic immunoadsorbent and guidelines for its use by which immune complexes can be removed from plasma and TSA generated for infusion into patients with cancer safely and with therapeutic benefit to the patients. A further object of the present invention is the provision of therapeutic, non covalently immobilized proteinA SPA as the immunoadsorbent. A further object of the present invention is the provision of protein A SPA non covalently immobilized in collodion membranes closely adjacent to charcoal. A further object of the present invention is the provision of the removal of immune complexes and generation of TSA from the circulation of patients with cancer by perfusion of plasma over such therapeutic immobilized protein A SPA . A further object of the present invention is the provision of a system and method by which plasma is separated from the whole blood and perfused over such therapeutic immobilized protein A SPA thereby removing the immune complexes from the blood plasma and generation of tumor specific antibodies TSA therein, then recombining the perfused plasma wlth the formed elements into whole blood and circulating the later back into the circulation system of the patients. A further object of the present invention is the provision of and a method and system for providing protein A perfused plasma by which tumor specific antibodies TSA have been generated for treatment either of the plasma donor or others with the same cancer and which can be stored in banks for later use. A further object of the present invention is the provision of guidelines for the safe and therapeutic use of protein A based for various body weights of patients including immobilized protein A quantity, volumes of plasma perfused and the rate of administration of plasma to the patient. A further object of the present invention is the provision of a safe and therapeutically effective protein A cartridge including its loading, distribution and physical arrangement of protein A particles in the cartridge. A further object of the present invention is the removal of immune complexes and generation of TSA in the plasma of patients with cancer by extracorporeal perfusion of plasma or non extracorporeal perfusion of plasma over immobilized protein A followed by drug infusion to the patient during the immediate postperfusion period. A further object of the present invention is the provision of a miniaturized therepeutic protein A immunoadsorbent which enables the processing of various small serum samples and assessment of their quantity of TSA in order to profile and screen patients for potential suitability for treatment. A further object of the present invention is the provision of a sensitive radioimmunoassay which measuresTSA in the serum of patients with cancer providing an important in vitro test for selection and assessment of patients undergoing extracorporeal immunoadsorbent treatment. Other and further features, objects and advantages of the invention appear throughout the specificatior and claims.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF TISE DRAWING Figure 1 is a schematic view of an extracorporeal immunoadsorption system utilizing a therapeutic protein A collodion charcoal immunoadsorbent according to the invention.

In addition, these tumoricidal responses can be further augmented with low dose chemotherapy given in the post treatment period. I have also demonstrated that large quantities of cytotoxic tumor associated antibodies are generated in plasma and deposited in neoplasms of tumor bearing hosts after such plasma perfusion, which antibodies appear to play a major role in initiating the observed tumor killing responses. In making the transition from canine studies to the treatment of patients with advanced breast adenocarcinoma,I discovered that perfusion of small volumes of plasma over non covalently immobilized protein A SPA and administered to patients resulted in rapid, extensive and specific tumor killing responses. This resulted in a change of the treatment system from an elaborate system of on line plasma cell separation and immunoadsorption to one of perfusion of small volumes of plasma over non covalently immobilized proteinA and administered to the patient. In clinical studies toxicity was observed during the initial phases to include hypotension, tachycardia, pulmonary rales and diarrhea. As a result of a comprehensive evaluation of this toxicity, I discovered that the clinical toxicity could be reduced by controlling the following parameters a quantities of protein A, b volumes of plasma perfused over immobilized protein A and delivered to the patient, c flow rates of plasma perfused over the immobilized protein A and delivered to the patient, and d treatment scheduling.This discovery is based upon careful studies which include recordings of clinical and seriological effects, blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance and that the following treatment conditions and guidelines could reduce the cardiovascular toxicity while preserving the tumor killing effects of therapy a immobilized protein A quantity ranging from about 0.12 mg to about 5.0 mg and preferably 0.6 mg adjusted for an adult spectrum of body weights and as little as 0.001 0.01 mg immobilized protein A for children, b volumes of 50 to 300 ml and preferably 50 ml of plasma perfused over the quantities of immobilized protein A and administered to adult patients and as little as 0.001 ml for children, c plasma flow rates of from about 2 to about Sml min perfused over immobilized protein A and administered to patients, and d a treatment schedule preferably at every second or third day intervals. I have also discovered criteria for the preparation of protein A immobilized on an inert carrier, such as charcoal. The immobilized protein A on the inert carrier, such as charcoal, must be loaded into a fluid bed in the chamber of the protein cartridge and each particle should be physically separated from one another to avoid coalescense and to enhance contact of the charcoal surface with the plasma perfused over it.Preferably, the immobilized protein A particles are distributed in a monolayer and it is also essential that the protein A be immobilized by adsorption and not by covalent bindIng. These are of great importance since they effect a plasma flow distribution over the immobilized protein A, b plasma contact and reaction time with the immobilized protein A, c the rate of administration of plasma to the patient, and d the effectiveness of the immobilized protein A in generating therapeutic products. Referring now to Figure 1, an extracorporeal immunoadsorption system having immobilized protein A as the immunoadsorbent is illustrated and generally designed by the reference numeral 10. An inflow line 12 is connected from a vein or artery of the patient 14 and whole blood from a host 14, here shown as a patient with breast cancer is pumped by the pump 16 into a continuous flow cell separator 18, here shorn as a filtration cell separator, which separates the whole blood into formed elements which flow into the line 20 and into plasma which flows in the line 22 to the therapeutic, extracorporeal immobilized protein A immunoadsorbent 24, as described in more detail later herein.Immune complexes are removed from the plasma by the immobilized protein A immunoadsorbent 24 and the plasma, with the immune complexes removed,flows in the line 26 into the drip chamber and bubble trap 28, into which also flows the formed elements in the line 20 so that the formed elements and the plasma with the immune complexes removed are combined into whole blood,which is returned in the outflow line 30 into a vein, here a femoral vein, not shown, of the patient 14. The outflow line 12 and inflow line 30 are connected into veins of the patient 14 by catheters,not shown although,the outflow line 12 can be connected by catheter to an artery of the patient 14. Any desired type of non pulsating pump can be used, such as Sarns Roller Pump, and the pump and the immunoadsorbent should be such as to permit adequate flow rates to prevent thrombogenicity or clotting of blood, and rates of lOmI min and above, such as 15 40m min through the system are satisfactory. Any continuous flow plasms cell separator can be utilized, such as the filtration cell separator illustrated in Figure 1 Travenol, Morton Grove, Illinois or for example, a centrifugal flow plasma cell separator American Instruments Company, Silver Springs,Maryland , in which whole blood is centrifuged at 12001500 Rev minute. The filtration cell separator in Figure 1 is shown expanded and includes the body members 18a and 18b and the gasket 18c. The body members include membranes, not shown, operative for the blood to flow out through the line 20 and the plasma to flow through into the line 22.Any desired cell separator can be used, a number of which are readily available on the market. The therapeutic, extracorporeal immobilized protein A immunoadsorbent can take a variety of forms, here shown as a flat or Frisbee form in Figure 1, or, for example, as a column 24a as illustrated in Figure 3. Referring to Figure 1, the frisbee cartridge of immunoadsorbent 24 is shown expanded for purposes of illustration and includes a lower pan or flat cylindricallike body member 32 into which is placed a stainless steel mesh disc 33 upon which are placed particles of protein A immobilized on inert support particles, preferably charcoal by collodion, 34. Placed on top of the particles of immobilized protein A 34 is another stainless steel mesh screen disc 36 and an upper flat or pancake like lid or body member 38 is disposed above the screen 36. In assembling the immunoadsorbent cartridge 24, the particles of protein A immobilized on an inert support, preferably activated charcoal by collodion 34, are loaded into a fluid bed and settle on the screen 33 placed in the bottom body member 32, the disc screen 36 is placed above them and the upper body member or lid 3S is then clamped down with its edges over the lower body member 32 thereby completely enclosing the immunoadsorbest particles 33 and screens 32 and 34 into the immunoadsorbent cartridge 24. In use, the separated plasma enters the therapeutic immunoadsorbent cartridge 24 through the line 22 and flows through the screen 32, the immobilized protein A immobilized on the inert support particles 33, the screen 26 and then out the outflow line 26 into the drip and bubble chamber 28. Referring now to Figure 3, a modified form of the therapeutic extracorporeal immunoadsorbent cartridge 24a in column form is illustrated. In this modification, the body is of tubular shape into which is placed the particles of immobilized protein A on an inert support, preferably collodion immobilized on activated charcoal particles, stainless steel filters, not shown, are provided at each end, and the tubular body is closed at the lower and upper ends by the closure members 32a and 38a, respectively, into which the inflow plasma line 22a and outflow plasma line 26a extend.. The therapeutic, extracorporeal immunoadsorbent cartridge may take a variety of forms, the presently preferred embodiment being the frisbee from illustrated in Figure 5. The screens 33 and 36, as well as those not shown in the column 24a, should have a mesh size in the range of from about 40 80 mesh. Referring now to Figures 4 and 5 a modified form of the plasma perfusion system is illustrated. This system is essentially the same as the system previously described, however, it does illustrate as inlets an inflow plasma line 22 and an inflow saline line 23, as well as a filter 19. Figure 5 is an expanded view of a protein A cartridge which includes the frame top 38, cartridge 37, gasket 35, screen 34, immobilized protein A on charcoal 33, spacer 31, bottom screen 29, cartridge bottom 32 and frame bottom 27. The protein A cartridge is assembled simply by securing the parts together as illustrated inFigure 5. The preferable immunoadsorbent is prepared by washing activated charcoal, preferably of vegetable origin such as coconut charcoal, 6 16 mesh FischerScientific Company, Fairlawn, New Jersey , extensively with distilled water and placing the charcoal particles under suction in order to remove debris and fines and then thoroughly drying the charcoal particles. The dried charcoal particles are then placed in a container, care being taken in the transfer process to avoid abrasion of the charcoal particles. The charcoal is added to a solution of collodion, ether and alcohol and protein A. The ether and alcohol are absorbed by the charcoal thereby immobilizing protein A in collodion membranes closely adjacent to and on the activated charcoal particles. The particles are then added to a beaker of normal saline and loaded m to the immunoadsorbent cartridge 24 which has been pre filled with fluid by the saline line 33. The particles are physically distributed in a monolayer, flat disc or in the column 24a in the form of a column, as previously described. It is important that the immobilized proteinA particles be premoistened before loading into the imtrnjnoadsorbent chamber and that the particles be loaded into a fluid filled chamber and be permitted to settle through the fluid onto the screen 29. It is also important that the particles be physically separated from one another in the chamber and non covalently immobilized on the support. The protein A collodion charcoal immunoadsorbent has the following important characteristics 1 it is bicompatible and incorporates large quantities of proteinA in its membranes, 2 the protein A collodioncharcoal presents a large surface to volume ratio so that a small extracorporeal volume of plasma may contact a large immunoadsorption surface, 3 the binding of protein A in collodion on charcoal is sufficiently firm to prevent release thereof into the circulation, 4 the collodion charcoal support is structurally stable to avoid embolization of the structured material into hosts, 5 the support and immobilized protein A is minimally thrombogenic to prevent clotting, and finally 6 protein A collodion charcoal has low non specific adsorption characteristics and allows adequate flow rates of plasma through it. While protein A SPA immobilized by collodion membranes on activated charcoal is preferred, protein A can be im.mobilized by other means on other support particles, for example, by adsorption, physical entrapment or by physical means readily available on other inert or derivatized support particles including synthetic materials, such as nylon, methacrylate, polystyrene, and other plastic and natural inert particles. The following examples I and II described presently preferred methods of preparing the preferred therapeutic, extracorporeal protein A collodion charcoal immunoadsorbent. EXC.PLE I In order to remove fines, debris, organic material and other contaminants, charcoal was treated in the following fashion. 350 grams of 6 16 mesh charcoal Fischer was poured into a No. 6 mesh screen and sieved into a No. 16 mesh screen. The large charcoal in the No. 6 mesch screen was discarded and the charcoal in the No. 16 mesh screen was poured into a 100 ml beaker. The charcoal in the beaker was washed by a tube in the bottom with 8L of non pyrogenic sterile water. The charcoal was then poured in a water slurry into an sterile liter bottle leaving about 5 of water above the top of the charcoal and then it was autoclaved for 20 minutes. The autoclaved charcoal was then washed with 4L of nonpyrogenic sterile water, placed in a dessicator under vacuum for 15 minutes, and washed with 4L of nonpyrogenic water. The charcoal was then dessicated under vacuum for 15 minutes, washed with 10L of nonpyrogenic sterile water and the water slurry of charcoal was covered with a clean drape and dried overnight at 2000F. Using sterile instruments, the charcoal was aliquoted into 30 g aliquots being careful not to scrape the charcoal on the bottom of the sieve to avoid the creating of fines.The aliquots were packed in towels, autoclaved for 40 minutes and dried in an over. overnight at 1500F. With this procedure most fines and debris were removed from the activated charcoal and the charcoal particles were now ready to be treated with the protein A collodion solution. EX u5PLE II For coating of charcoal with protein A collodion, a solution of 0.15M Tris buffer pH 7.4, was dissolved in 200 ml of sterile water, pH 7.4. In a beaker, 4.1 ml of absolute alcohol was added with 4.1 ml of collodion and 40 ml ether. 5 mg protein A in 0.5 ml 0.15 M Tris was added to the beaker. The stirbar was then removed with sterile forceps and 30 grams of the processed charcoal was added to the beaker and gently stirred under a vacuum hood until the charcoal was dry. The charcoal was then placed in a sterile pyrex drying pan and dried in a hood overnight under ultraviolet light. The resulting therapeutic, immunoadsorbent consisted of protein A nonchemically immobilized in collodion membranes bound closely adjacent to the surface of the activated charcoal particles and had all of the desirable properties and characteristics set forth above. while activated coconut charcoal is particularly suited and preferred, charcoal, particularly activated charcoal of vegetable origin is satisfactory. EXAPLE III This example illustrates the application of the system and method to dogs. Forty dogs with various spontaneous solid tumors were treated for one hour by extracorporeal perfusion over protein A bearing staphylococcus aureus Cowans I. All dogs showed a severe necrotizing killing reaction with some associated healing of ulcerated tumorous lesions. Terman et al, J. Immunol., 124, 795 1980 . In 5 tumor bearing dogs, plasma was removed, stored then perfused into them after perfusion over immobilized protein A and profound tumor killing responses were observed. EXAEIPLE IV In this example, the plasma perfusion system ofExample III was revised by immobilizing purified proteinA in a collodion charcoal matrix. Preclinical investigations with protein A collodion charcoal system were made in dogs with various spontaneous neoplasms.These studies were done under conditions which would closely simulate those which were to be subsequently employed in patients. Dogs were sedated and whole blood was pumped into a continuous flow plasma cell separator where it was partitioned into formed elements and plasma.Plasma 1 calculated plasma volume was then selectively circulated at flow rates of 5 20 ml min over a protein A collodion charcoal column containing 5 10mg of immobilized protein A. The plasma emerging from the column was then reunited with formed elements and passaged back to the dog by a peripheral vein.Summary of the acute tumoricidal reactions observed in 8 dogs within 12 hours after treatment are shown in Table 1.

Patients 1, 2, 4 andµ5 had recurrent breast adenocarcinoma 6 months to 3 years after mastectomy. At the time of initiation of munotherapy, all patients had chest wall tumor which was fixed to underlying fascia and or muscle. Patients if 1 44 had supraclavicular lymph node extension of tumor. Patient 1 had metastatic lesions in right humerus, tibia and fibula and patient 2 had diffuse bilateral lung and pleural metastases with bilateral pleural effusions. Associated medical conditions in all patients are shown in Table 3. Before beginning treatment, each patient had 2 physical examination, cornpletc blood count studies of liver and renal function, measurements of blood calcium, uric acid, total protein and albumin, chest roentgenogram, mestastic skeletal survey and radionuclide scans of liver, spleen and bones. Tests were repeated at appropriate intervals to evaluate response to therapy.Microscopic and ultrastructural evaluation of tumor tissue was undertaken on tumor biopsy specimens obtained before and at various intervals after treatments by previously described methods.

Tumor diameters were measured along 2 axes, one being the longest and the other the longest perpendicular to it by a minimum of 2 investigators and the sum of the products of the tumor diameters was determined.The criteria for responses were modifications of those adopted by the International Union Against Cancer.Partial remission was at least a 50 decrease in the product of diameters in measurable lesions. No lesion could have progressed nor any new lesion appear, but every lesion need not have regressed for qualification for partial remission. Less than partial remission or improvement indicated a 25 to 50 decrease in measurable lesions. Stable disease was defined as less than 25 decrease or a less than 25 increase in the size of measurable lesions and progressive disease as greater than or equal to a 25 increase in size of any lesion or appearance of new lesions. Plas a Perfusion Systems Protein A Pharmacia, Piscataway, New Jersey 0.125 mg, 0.6 mg, 1.25 mg, or 5 mg, were immobilized in 30 grams of collodion charcoal by a modification of previously described techniques 5 8 . Protein A collodion charcoal PACC particles were placed in a monolayer between 40 mesh screens and washed with saline 7000 mi . Microbiologic cultures, linulus and rabbit pyrogen tests in sale wash effluent from PACC were negative 9,10 . A cartridge containing PACC was positioned on the plasma line of a continuous flow plasma cell separator American Instrument Company, SilverSpring, Maryland . whole blood was pumped from the subclavian vein into a continuous flow plasma cell separator where it was partitioned into formed elements and plasma.Separated plasma was first pumped through 0.45 micron pleated membrane filter, then through thePACC column at flow rates of 10 20 ml min after which it rejoined the formed elements and was returned into a peripheral vein. In other studies the cell separation unit was not employed instead plasma infusion treatments were carried out with plasma which was collected by phlebotomy of whole blood from patients or donors. Formed elements were returned and plasma was stored in 50 ml aliquots in citrate phosphate dextrose anti coagulant at 20 C.For treatments, plasma in 20 200 ml volumes was first passaged through a 0.45 micron pleated filter, then over PACC at flow rates of 2 20 mi min and returned to the patient intravenously. Saline, 700 ml, was then infused through the system to clear the circuit of plasma.Treatment Conditions Table 3 gives treatment schedules, protein A quantities employed, volumes of plasma utilized and rate of plasma administration.

Twenty minutes after the completion of perfusion, the patient experienced pain in tumor sites on chest wall and supraclavicular lyrrph nodes as well as right humerus.In the next 2 hours, tumor in chest wall and supraclavicular lymph nodes became hyperemic and edematous. Within 48 hours, multiple spontaneous ulcerations appeared on the chest wall tumor surface while the contralateral normal breast showed no inflammatory reaction. Chest wall and left supraclavicular lymph nodes became less adherent to underlying tissue. Microscopic and ultrastructural evaluation of tumor tissue 48 hours after treatment confirmed the presence of diffuse tumor cell necrosis with minimal inflammatory cell infiltration. The rapidity of onset of this tumoricidal reaction and the absence of inflammatory cells in the lesion after treatment suggested that plasw.a borne tumoricidal factor s were activated after contact of plasma withPACC. Hence, patient 1 underwent phlebotomy on 2 occasions in which a total of 1000 ml of plasma was collected.On 5 occasions, at 5 l4 day intervals, this plasma was perfused in 100 or 200 ml volumes over PACC and returned to the patient intrnvenously. Shortly after each of these treatments, the patient experienced pain in tumor sites in chest wall, supraclavicular lymph nodes and right humerus hyperemia and edema were present in chest wall and supraclavicular lesions Forty two days after the commencing immunotherapy total of S treatnents , there was a 60 reduction in tumor dimensions Table 5 .Following a total of 12 treatments given over a 123 day period, there was a 79.8 reduction of tumor dimensions Table 4 . There was nearly total disappearance of a metastatic supraclavicular lymph node after the 6th treatment. Pain present before beginning treatment at metastatio sites in right humerus radioisotopic scan of the bones done 59 and 109 days after treatment showed densities in metastatic sites similar to those observed before tc tment with no progression or dissemination.

Objective partial remission was observed after 6 treatments or 13 days following immunotherapy. Patient 2 was treated once by perfusion of 100 ml of autologous plasma over 5 mg of immobilized protein A.She experienced pain,hypercmia and edema of chest wall lesions shortly after concluding treatment. while there was reduction in the number of cutaneous nodules present in the chest wall, objective regression in chest wall tumor could not be discerned in the ensuing 7 days pulmonary lesions could not be evaluated because of the presence of bilateral pleural effusions. To assess the effects of lower doses of immobilized protein A on therapeutic response,1.25 mg and 0.6 mg of immobilized protein A were employed for treatments in patients 3 and 4 respectively compared to 5 mg in patient 1. In addition, treatments were scheduled at more frequent intervals 2 or 3 days compared to patient41. Shortly after each perfusion, patient 3 experienced severe pain associated with hyperemia and edema localized in tumor on chest wall and supraclavicular lymph nodes which lasted for several days after treatment. Tumor necrosis was evident in a large ulcerating tumor site on the breast after each treatment.After completing 5 treatments over a 9 day period, there was a reduction of 33. lo in tumor dimensions Table 5 which was associated with a loss of adherence of tumor to the underlying chest wall.The controlateral normal breast showed no inflammatory response during treatment. Microscopic examination of tumor tissue after 5 treatments showed extensive necrosis of neoplastic cells and numerous tumor cell ghosts. Patient At4 underwent 6 treatments in which 50 ml of pretreatment plasma was passaged over 0.6 mg of imobilized protein A. She experienced acute reactions in her tumor after each treatment similar to patient 3. Thirteen days after commencing treatments she had a 66.6 reduction in tumor dimensions Table 5 wall. This patient underwent an additional 12 treatments over a 45 day period, during which the tumor regression was substained. Miscroscopic examination of tumor tissue 17 days after commencing treatement showed necrosisi of tumor cells and numerous tumor cell ghosts. Clinical and Morphologic After Perfusion Homologous Plasma Over PACC To determine whether plasma from patient 1 which induced a tumor regression after passage over PACC, could be transferred and induce a similar response in another patient with breast adonocarcinoma, patient 5 was treated with plasma obtained from patient 1 und additional patient the adnocarcinoma. Ten to 20 minutes after each of there treatements, the patient optional pain localized in the wall tumor which became hyperomic, edematous and tender over the ensuing 12 hours. There was no reaction in the contralateral normal breast. Forty four days after beginning Lherdpy total of 8 ters Table 4 . was a 57,4 reduction in tumor diameters Table 4 . Toxicity A summary of clinical toxicity observed D these 5 patients is given in Table 5. perfusion tre rninutes after completion of most plasma perfusion treatements, patients experienced chills with subsequent temperature elevations, tachycardia and moderate to severe pain located to tumor sitcs on the chest wall which, in sore instances, lasted for several days after treatment.The most severe toxicity was experienced in the 2 patients whose plasma was perfused over the highest quantity of protein A. In patient 1, hypotension occurred in 6 of 12 treatments, nausea and vomiting in 9. This patient also showed the highest mean temperature elevation and developed pulmonary rales on 2 occasions. when it occurred, hypotension was managed with fluids,colloid, vasopressors or a short course of corticosteroid therapy. Patient4Q, whose plasma was also perfused over Smg of immobilized protein A, had extensive lung metastases of her breast adenocarcinoma with bilateral pleural effusions. During her first treatment, she developed acute bronchospasm with pulmonary rales which was reversed with bronchodilators and corticosteroid treatment. When immobilized protein A dose was lowered to 1.25 mg or 0.6 mg in patienti3,84, and , episodes of hypotension, nausea, vomit were reduced and pulmonary rales were not observed. Temperature elevations and tachycardia occurred but were not as severe as in patientS1.

The catheter was appropriately positioned in the pulmonary artery. A Teflon arterial catheter Intracath, Chicago,Illinois was placed in a peripheral artery and connected to a strain gauge pressure transducer. Intracardiac and systemic blood pressures, electrocardiographic tracing and rectal temperature were displayed continuously on a bedside multigraph recorder Mennen Gratebach, Chicago, Illinois .Mean pressurcs were obtained by electronic integration and heart rate was determined from the electrocardiographic signal. Thc mid axillary line was defined as the 0 pressure reference level. For sore treatements, arterial blood pressure was determined by arm cuff and mercury manometer. In these instances, mean blood pressure was calculated by adding 1 3 of the pulse pressure to the dissastolic blood pressure.Rectal temperature readings were monitored continuously with a rectal probe. An average of three cardiac output determinations was made by thermal dilution technique. Data recorded included mean right strial pressure, RAP , pulmonary artery pressure PAP , mean pulmonary artery pressure PAP , wean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure PCW , systolic S , diastolic D and mean BP arterial blood pressure BP .Herodynamic indices were derived from pressure and cardiac output data according to the following standard formulae Systemic vascular resistance SVR 80 bF RAP Cardiac Output both expressed as dynes sec cm 5 Stroke Volume Cardiac Output Heart Rate. Baseline hemodynami parameteers were obtained at 5 minute intervals 3 to 5 tires before beginning plasma infusion treatments. During infusion, aforementioned parameters were measured every 5 minutes for the first 90 minutes and subsequently every 10 to 15 minutes for an additional 6 hours. Parameters were then measured every 30 to 60 minutes for the ensuing 18 to 24 hours.Definition of Initial and Modified Treatment Conditions Table 6 defines the characteristics for treatment conditions. A total of 14 treatments were carried out ulcer the initial conditions, 12 in patient1, 2 in paticnt 5. For the initial treatment program, 1.25 mg or 5 mg of immobilized protein A was used, with plasma volumes of 100 to 300 nl nfuscd at flow rates of 20 to 30 ml min. Modified treatment conditions were employed in patien s for a total of 32 treatments.These conditions were as follows reduced quantities of protein A 0.6125 g to 1.25 mg , smaller volumes of plasma infused 5 to 150 tnl , and slowcr Infusion flow rates 2 to 5 ml in Table 7 .

Concomitant with the diminished pres sures was a tachycardia with pulse rate increasing from 93 10 beats min mean standard deviation for 12 treatments to 135 15 beats min. Cardiac output also increased from 6.5 1.2 L min to 9.8 2.5 L min. The systemic vascular resistance declined from 1200 150 dynes sec 5 5 cm to 620 75 dynes sec cm . Total pulmonary vascular resistance was also diminished. Stroke volume initially increased as the cardiac output rose, however subsequently decreased despite the cardiac output remaining elevated over the baseline level. Rectal temperature for the group rose to approximately 39 1.50C. Modified Treatment Conditions Table 8 summarizes the maximum and minimum parameter changes during immunoperfus ion for this group treated with modified conditions and compares them to the group treated under initial conditions. Generally, there were fewer cardiovascular changes when the modified treatment conditions were employed. Specifically, maximum heart rate was 144 8 beats min compared to 122 15 beats min p.O.0OI . The lowest systemic vascular resistance reached in the modified treatment group was 5 1063 112 dynes sec cm , p 0.005 .Indeed, there was a 53 fall from baseline for the initial group compared to a 25 decline in the modified treatment group p 0.005 , The mean blood Pressure in the modified treatment group fell to only 77 11 mmHg compared to 59 14 minHg in the initial treatment group, p 0.001 . Additionally, the maximum rectal temperature noted in the modified treatment group was only 38.3 0.9 C vs. 40 0.50C p 0.001 for the initial treatment group conditions.

In patient 3 immunotherapy reduced the major tumor in the breast and its adherence to the chest wall. hence, surgical excision of the tumor was carried out uneventfully and there has been no evidence of local recurrence of tumor 6 months after surgery. Patientit4 , underwent chemotherapy with adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and 5 fluorouricil and over a 2 month period has realized a further regression of measurable lesions 91 and complete healing of ulcerated areas of neoplasm on the chest wall. Since concluding immunotherapy, patient5 underwent chemotherapy for 6 months during which time her chest wall tumor showed further reduction in size and it was subsequently removed surgically. In addition to her breast cancer, patient 41 had Laennec s cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and thrombocytopeia at the time of initiation of immunotherapy.She developed a staphylococcal bacteremia thought to have arisen from an intravenous catheter site which was brought under control with nafcillin however, she lapsed into hepatic coma shortly after oral feedings were begun and expired 4 weeks after her last treatment.Autopsy showed a small liver 1000 gms containing extensive micronodular Laennec s cirrhosis, with cholestatis possible induced by nafcillin and no evidence of hepatic metastases. Her breast adenocarcinoma in the chest wall and supraclavicular lymph nodes were markedly reduced from pretreatment size and largely replaced by connective tissue. Very small microscopic foci of tumor were found in right lung, thyroid and pituitary which were undetectjble by clinical, laboratory and roentgenographic studies while the patient was undergoing immunotherapy. Patienta 2 with diffuse metastatic lung disease was given radiation after immunotherapy but died 6 weeks later of her extensive pulumonary disease. EXAMPLE VI In this example, a synergistic effect between protein A collodion charcoal PACC and drug infusion was obtained. Spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma occurs commonly in adult female dogs and is considered to represent an excellent model of human breast adenocarcinoma. I have discovered that the observed tutnoricidal response observed in d3gs with spontaneous breast cancer after extracorporeal perfusion over SAC is, in part, due to the activation of tumor specific antibodies TSA in plasma after perfusion. Terman et al, supra. In separate in vitro studies, TSA have been shown to work synergistically with cytosine arabinoside Ara C to inhibit tumor cell replication. Shearer,W.T., Philpott, G.W., and Parker, C.W., Science 182,1357 1973 Shearer, W. T. ,and Mettes, H.J., J. Immunol.123,2763 1979 . One aspect of the present invention is a new methodology which markedly augments the magnitude of the tumoricidal response induced by extracorporeal perfusion over immobilized protein A. Dogs with spontaneous breast adenocarcinoma were given Ara C, lOmg kg, intravenously for 4 hours and showed. no significant niorphologic changes in their tumor.Seven to 12 days later, the same dogs underwent extracorporeal perfusion over PACC alone, which resulted in hypermic response at single and multiple visible areas of tumor occurring 4 to 8 hours after perfusion and progressing to necrosis of visible tumorous sites by 12 hours. Ten to 21 days later when inflammatory reactions had subsided and tumors had regrown to near original dimensions, each dog underwent a similar extracorporeal perfusion over protein A which was followed by infusion of Ara C 10 mg kg for 4 hours in the immediate post perfusion period. This resulted in a far more rapid and extensive necrosis of visible tumorous sites than was observed with protein A perfusion alone.Severe hyperemic reactions were evident within 30 minutes to 2 hours after perfusion progressing to very extensive necrosis by 12 hours. Normal mammary glands in the same dogs showed no morphologic changes in the course of these tumoricidal reactions. Twelve to 21 days later when tumors had regrown to near original size, all dogs underwent extracorporeal perfusion over a collodion charcoal column with no protein A immobilized and no tumoricidal responses were observed. Three additional dogs underwent only PACC Ara C treatment and showed rapid and profound necrotizing reactions. Microscopic examination of the tumor tissue obtained before and 24 hours after treatment with each of these programs where a more extensive necrotizing tumoricidal reaction after the PACC Ara C program compared to the PACC regimen alone. Tumor necrosis as judged by densitometric evaluation of tumor reactions resulting from extracorporeal perfusion over PACC was markedly augmented by administration of a single nontoxic dose of Ara C in the post perfusion period. Ara C infusion exerted no evident tumoricidal response. However, when the drug was given after PACC perfusion, the observed response far exceeded that noted after PACC alone.The responses for the PACC Ara C regimen was substantially greater than the albebraic sum of responses to Ara C and PACC strongly suggesting that the effect of the drug was markedly potentiated by PACC perfusion. EXAMPLE VII In addition to Ara C, adriamycin, methotrexate, cyclophospharide, 5 fluorouricil can be used as the anti cancer drug infusion, or combinations thereof for various periods before, during and after perfusion over immobilized protein A with good results. In 2 human patients, the use of adriamycin, 5 fluorouricil and cyclophosphamide resulted in additional tumor killing when given at the conclusion of plasma perfusion treatments. EXAMPLE 7III Referring now to Figure 2, a miniaturized proteinA collodion charcoal assembly or cartridge 24 is illustrated which enables the processing of small amounts of serum through it to assess the changes in levels of tumor specific antibodies in serum samples coming from the immunoadsorbent column. This permits the profiling and screening of patients serum for use in extracorporeal immunoadsorption for treatment of cancer with the larger protein A Iniirrunadsorbent cartridge 24 or column 24a. The miniaturized frisbee 24b is in all particulars the same as the frisbee or cartridge 24 except that it is in miniature form. In practice a preferred size for the perfusion frisbee about 12 cm in diameter, with the miniaturized frisbee being about 3 cm in diameter. Similarly, the miniaturized column 24a is 2 cm tall and 3 cm in diameter whereas, the perfusion column 24a is 8 cm tall and 3 cm in diameter. The column is useful in testing but not for use in vivo. In use, a small amount of serum, about 5 ml, enters the miniaturized protein A collodion charcoal immunoadsorbent cartridge 24b in the line 12b and passes through it and out the line 26b and is gathered in a test tube or other suitable container 40. The perfused serum is then assessed for changes in levels of tumor specific antibodies. This permits the profiling and screening of patients serum to determine whether they will response by showing a tumoricidal reaction when their plasma is perfused over the larger protein charcoal frisbee or column in vitro. The serum may be assessed in any desired way however, because of its exquisite capacity to detect and quantitate very small quantities of TSA, it is preferred to measure the .TSA in the perfused serum of patients with cancer by radioimmunoassay RIA which involves the fixation of cancer cells, such as breast adenocarcinoma, with glutaraldehyde, which fixed cells then serve as a target for testing the perfused serum incubated with the cells. After washing of the cells, a radioactiveindicator as such as I protein A is employed as an indicator in the system. Results are expressed as a percentage of 1251 protein A bound to tumor cells after subtracting backgroud radioactivity and radioactivity bound by normal serum controls. The following example describes the preferred manner of fixation of the cultured cells in glutaraldehyde. EXAMPLE IX The tumor cells are washed three times in phosphate buffered saline PBS by centrifuging at 1200 rpm for 3 min. The washed cells were then put through doubled gauze and syringe to eliminate clumped cells, resuspended to PBS in 10 8 cells ml. Equal volumes of 0. 2 glutaraldehyde in PBS and the cell suspension were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with periodic agitation. The cells were washed in PBS and then placed in a solution containing 5 BSA or 2 chicken serum in PBS and centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 3 minutes and the supernate decanted. These cells were again washed in PBS, centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 3 minutes and again decanted. The cells were then resuspended in a moderately large volume of PBS and 1 mg merthiolate a few grains was added. In this example a preferred cellular RIA procedure is described.All specimens were run in triplicate. The controls include cells Incubated ith 2 chicken serum and 1 BSA, in PES, 10 x 75 mm glass tubes were coated with 3.0 ml of 2 BSA 2 chicken serum in PBS for 60 minutes at 23 to 280C. The tubes were rinsed three times with PBS.Test serum and control serum were thawed, and each centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 15 minutes. 0.3 ml of diluted serum sample was added to appropriate tubes and controls. The cell preparation comprised washing the cells 3 times, after which they were resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 2.2 x 105 cells 0.5 ml. 0.5 ml of tumor cells were added to each tube containing test serum or control serum and incubated at 370 for 60 minutes with periodic agitation. The tumor cells were washed three times and the supernate decanted. A suitable radioactive marker was added, such as 125I protein A diluted to give approximately 10 cpm 0.5 ml in 1 BSA PBS. Any suitable radioactive marker was can be use, however, such as 125IgG or 131IgG from goat or other species specific for canine or human IgG.To each tube, 1.0 ml PBS,was added, and the tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and the supernate aspirated. 0.5 ml diluted 125I protein A was added to each tube and incubated at 37 for 1 hour.1.0 ml of 1 BSA PBS and 1.0 ml PBS were added to the tubes, the tubes centrifuged at about 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and then washed, centrifuged and supernatc aspirated. The radioactivity in the cell pallet was determined for 1 minute in each tub. Cancer cells may be fixed with glutaraldehyde which serve as a target for testing the sera in this system. However, the fixing of the cancer cells can be in other ways, such as, in formalin by conventional procedures know to the art. EYSxIPLE X In this example, plasma was collected from tumor bearing patients and perfused as described above over protein A immobilized in membranes of collodion. The plasma was stored in protein A perfused plasma banks or perfused directly into other patients with the same cancer at the same or a later time. Hence, plasma from tumor bearing patients may be processed over immobilized protein A in two ways a by direct extraction from the patient, cell separation and plasma perfusion over immobilized proteinA in an extracorporeal continuous flow system and method and b by separate plasam removal from a tumor bearing patient followede by perfusion off line over immobilized protein A at a later time. The various aspects of the present invention are therefore well suited and adapted to attain the objects and ends and have the advantages and features mentioned as well as those shill are inherent therein. While presently preferred embodiments of the various aspects of the invention have been given for the purposes of disclosure, changes can be made therein which are covered by the claims and the equivalents.
