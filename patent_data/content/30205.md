# Non reversible brake adjuster.

## Abstract
A brake adjuster 10 , including a pin 34 interconnect ing a brake pressure plate 12 at one end and a metal swage 40 at the opposite end and oriented within a deformable tube 30 such as to radially deform the tube to the shape of the swage as the swage moves into the tube bore in response to brake wear, is rendered non reversible to load ing in the reverse direction by a washer 44 mounted on the pin, relative to the swage, and having the circumferential geometric configuration of the tube bore such as to move easily within the bore in the swaging direction but stopped from movement in the opposite direction by the deformed portion of the tube. In alternative embodiments a tube is mounted on the pin or the pin diameter is increased to approximate the bore diameter of the deformable tube. The trailing edges of the tube or the pin adjacent the leading edge of the swage abutt the deformed portion of the tube in the reverse direction to prevent motion in that direction.
