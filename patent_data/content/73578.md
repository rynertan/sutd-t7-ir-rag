## Description
PAPER FEEDING DEVICE FOR USE WITH A PRINTER The present invention relates to a paper feeding device for use with a printer, e.g. a printer which may be connected to a computer. Recently a terminal printer for a computer has been utilized as an output device for a word processor. Such a printer is inevitably required to print on both the continuous stationery known as fan fold paper, which has sprocket holes adjacent opposite edges of the paper, and on unapertured single sheet paper such as letter paper. However, letter paper is less used by users of such a printer than fan fold paper.Accordingly, a conventional printer often has a form or a structure which is convenient for use with fan fold paper but which is not convenient for use with letter paper. According, therefore, to the present invention, there is provided a paper feeding device for use with a printer, said device comprising a rotatable cylindrical platen presser roller means movable into and out of an operative position in which an unapertured sheet of paper can be pressed thereby into engagement with the platen for movement around the latter when the platen is rotated and two spaced apart paper feeding means provided with means engageable in holes in an apertured sheet of paper and operable to move the latter around the platen when the presser roller means are out of the operative position oharacterised in that two spaced apart paper guide members are interposed between the two paper feeding means, each paper guide member having a first guide portion for guiding thereover the apertured sheet which has been moved around the platen by the paper feeding means, and second and third guide portions which respectively serve as an entrance path and an exit path for the said unapertured sheet when the latter is introduced into position around the platen. Each paper guide member preferably has a guide wall for guiding a respective edge of the said unapertured sheet, the paper guide members being positionable in use so that the guide walls engage opposite edges of the said unapertured sheet. The first guide portion of each paper guide member is preferably constituted by an arcuate peripheral portion of the respective guide wall. The guide wall of each paper guide member preferably extends outwardly of a wall member which forms part of the respective paper guide member the wall member having a peripheral surface which constitutes the said third guide portion Each paper guide member preferably has a slot which constitutes the second guide portion. Thus each paper guide member may have a second wall member which is spaced from the first mentioned wall member so as to form the said slot. Preferably, the paper feeding means and the paper guide members are mounted on a common guide shaft. Lock means are preferably provided for releasably locking each paper guide member to the said guide shaft. Thus each lock means may comprise a lock member which is carried by the respective paper guide member and which is axially slidable along the said guide shaft, the lock member being rotatable on said guide shaft into and out of a locking position, there being a spring which engages the lock member when the latter is in the locking position so as to frictionally force the lock member against the guide shaft to prevent axial movement of the lock member. The invention also comprises a printer provided with a paper feeding device as set forth above. Such a printer may be a terminal printer for a computer utilised as an output device for a word processor. The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a view, partly in section, showing the path of the paper in a known printer, Figure 2 is a perspective view illustrating how a sheet of letter paper may be adjusted in a typewriter so that top and bottom ends of the sheet are made parallel, Figure 3 is a perspective view of a printer provided with a paper feeding device according to the present invention, Figure 4 is a broken away sectional view of a part of the paper feeding device shown in Figure 3 and showing a lock means for releasably locking a paper guide member in position, and Figures 5 and 6 are cross sectional views of a part of the paper feeding device shown in Figure 3, Figures 5 and 6 respectively illustrating the use of the said paper feeding device with fan fold paper, and with letter paper. Terms such as left and right , as used in the description below, are to be understood to refer to directions as seen in the accompanying drawings. Referring now to the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a view, partly in section, showing the path of the paper in a known printer adapted for use with the continuous stationery known as fan fold paper. A sheet 10 of fan fold paper, whose opposite edges are provided with sprocket holes not shown , is inserted from a paper entrance path 1, is wound around a platen 2, and has its sprocket holes engaged by sprocket wheels 3 only one shown so as to be fed in the direction of an arrow 11.Each sprocket wheel 3 forms part of a paper feeding means 9 mounted on a sprocket guide shaft 5, the sprocket wheels 3 being mounted on a sprocket drive shaft 4. Each of the opposite ends of the sprocket drive shaft 4 and of the sprocket guide shaft 5 are supported by a frame not shown . Reference numeral 6 denotes a printing head. Presser rollers 7, 8 are movable into and out of an operative position in which an unapertured sheet 22 Figure 2 of letter paper, i.e. a sheet which does not have sprocket holes, can be pressed by the presser rollers 7, 8 into engagement with a platen 2 for movement around the latter when the platen 2 is rotated. Figure 2 is a perspective view showing how the sheet 22 of letter paper may be adjusted in a typewriter so that top and bottom ends 23, 24 of the sheet 22 become parallel. This may be done by aligning both the top end 23 and the bottom end 24 of the sheet 22 of letter paper mounted on a platen 21 so that printed lines on the sheet 22 are parallel to each other. When the sheet 22 of letter paper is used in the printer shown in Figure 1, the entrance path therefor may be any of those indicated by arrows 12, 13 or 14, and the exit path therefor may be either of those indicated by arrows 15 or 16. In this case, however, if the sheet 22 is adjusted in the same way as in the case of its use in a typewriter, the above mentioned operation of setting the sheet 22 onto the platen 2 is hindered by the sprocket drive shaft 4 or by the sprocket guide shaft 5. Consequently, a printer as shown in Figure 1 is unsuitable for use with letter paperMoreover, the method shown in Figure 2 for adjusting the paper in a typewriter does not make for operational efficiency and also is inconvenient when sheets are liable to be changed many times. Figure 3 is a perspective view of a printer incorporating a paper feeding device according to the present invention.Fan fold paper not shown in Figure 3 but shown in Figure 5 at 51 is moved over a rotatable cylindrical platen 35 by spaced apart paper feeding means 31, 32 which are mounted on a guide shaft 34. Each of the paper feeding means 31, 32 is provided with a sprocket 31a mounted on a drive shaft 33, the sprockets 31a having teeth 31b engageable in holes not shown in the fan fold paper 51 adjacent its opposite edges. A pair of spaced apart paper guide members 36, 37, which are interposed between the two paper feeding means 31, 32, are supported by the two shafts 33, 34 and are axially movable thereover.Each paper guide member 36, 37 has a guide wall 36 2, 36 3 for guiding a respective edge of a single sheet of unapertured paper not shown in Figure 3 but shown in Figure 6 , the paper guide members 36, 37 being positionable in use so that the guide walls 36 2, 36 3 engage opposite edges of the said unapertured sheet Lock members 38, 39, which are rotatably mounted on and axially movable along the guide shaft 34, are carried by the paper guide members 36, 37 and are mounted in U shaped grooves 36 1, 37 1 in the paper guide members 36,37. The paper guide members 36, 37 are arrangeable symmetrically of the printer and for the sake of convenience only, the left hand paper guide member 36 will be referred to hereinafter, the construction of the right hand paper guide member 37 being substantially identical to that of the left hand paper guide member 36. Referring to Figure 4, the lock member 38, when disposed in a first or inoperative position shown by a two dot and dash line, is substantially free from a spring member 42 disposed in the U shaped groove 36 1 of the paper guide member 36 so that the paper guide member 36 is axially movable along the guide shaft 34. when, however, the lock member 38 is manually rotated into a second or locking position shown by a solid line, the lock member 38 is frictionally forced against the guide shaft 34 by reason of the force of the spring member 42 against the lock member 38. Axial movement of the lock member 38 is thus prevented and the paper guide member 36 is fixed on the guide shaft 34. The lock member 39 is constructed similarly to the lock member 38 and operates in a similar manner. Figure 5 is a sectional view of the printer of Figure 3 showing the use of the apertured fan fold paper 51. The apertured fan fold paper 51 is introduced into a paper entrance path 52, is wound around the platen 35, passes in front of a printing head 59, has its sprocket holes not shown engaged with the teeth 31b of the sprockets 31a of the paper feeding means 31, 32 a sprocket 31a being shown by a broken line , and is fed in the direction of an arrow 58. The apertured fan fold paper 51 is then guided by an arcuate peripheral portion 36 4 of the guide wall 36 2, 36 3 of the paper guide member 36, which thus constitutes a first guide portion of the latter, the peripheral portion 36 4 being so formed as to fit the paper path.The peripheral portion 36 4, and the corresponding peripheral portion 37 4 of the paper guide member 37, has the function of preventing the paper 51 from sagging between the pair of paper feeding means 31, 32 and of keeping the paper taut. When fan fold paper 51 is used, presser rollers 56, 57 are held in positions in which they do not force the paper into engagement with the platen 35. The guide wall 36 2, 36 3 of each paper guide member 36, 37 extends outwardly of a first wall member 43 which forms part of the respective paper guide member 36, 37,the wall member 43 having a peripheral surface 36 6. Each paper guide member 36, 37 also has a second wall member 44 which is spaced from the respective first wall member 43 so as to form a slot 36 5. Figure 6 is a sectional view of the printer in which an unapertured sheet 61 of letter paper is used, i.e. a sheet which does not have sprocket holes. The sheet 61 of letter paper is inserted into a paper entrance path constituted by the slot 36 5 which constitutes a second guide portion of the paper guide member 36,the paper entrance path 36 5 being formed in the paper guide member 36. The sheet 61 is then wound around the platen 35, passes in front of the printing head 59 while being pressed by the presser rollers 56, 57 into engagement with the platen 35, and is fed in the direction of an arrow 68 by the rotation of the platen 35. As will be appreciated, the presser rollers 56,57 are moved to an inoperative position while the sheet 61 is being introduced, and are thereafter moved into their operative position.During paper feeding, the sheet 61 of letter paper is controlled by a third guide portion constituted by the peripheral surface 36 6 of the paper guide member 37 so as to be fed straight, the third guide portion 36 6 serving as an exit path for the sheet 61. In addition, the paper position in the direction of the paper width is determined by the guide walls which are shaded in Figure 6 and which are indicated at 36 2, 36 3 in Figure 3 . Hence, if the positions of the guide walls 36 2, 36 3 of the pair of paper guide members 36, 37 are fixed in advance with respect to the guide shaft 34 so that they are suitably spaced apart for the width of the sheet 61 of letter paper, the latter is controlled at the paper entrance path 36 5 and at the exit path 36 6 by the guide walls 36 2, 36 3 respectively, and is positioned vertically to the length of the platen 35.Thus, the sheet 61 is automatically adjusted to have lines parallel to the top and bottom ends of the sheet 61. In other words, when a sheet 61 of letter paper is used, it is unnecessary to go to the trouble of adjusting the sheet, as one has to do when it is used in a typewriter, as shown in Figure 2. Consequently, the device of the present invention is such that sheets of letter paper may be easily used therein. The device of the present invention may be used in association with any type of printing method. For example, it may be used with an impact type printer using wires to produce dots or a daisy wheel7 or with a non impact type printer, e.g.an ink jet printer or a thermal head printer. Although the embodiment of the present invention which is shown in Figures 3 6 employs sprocket wheels as a paper feeding means for fan fold paper, it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that other paper feeding means may be employed, such as traction means. As described above, when the device of the present invention is combined with a printer, the combination is suitable both for fan fold paper and for single sheets of unapertured paper such as letter paper.
