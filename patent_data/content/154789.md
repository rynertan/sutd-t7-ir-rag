# Polyfunctional phenolic reaction product, a process for its preparation and its use.

## Abstract
A polyfunctional reaction product having functional phenolic OH groups is made available by reacting a phenol and an alkoxylated amine aldehyde condensation product in the presence of a solvent and of an acid catalyst. This method makes it possible to prepare a polyfunctional phenolic reaction product which is soluble in organic sol vents at a low ratio of phenolic OH groups to alkoxy groups without gelling. The reaction product is particularly useful as a curing agent for epoxy resins.
