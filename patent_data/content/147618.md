# ANTIMICROBIAL FABRICS

## Abstract
An antimicrobial fabric is comprised of an aminoalkyl silylated fabric to which is covalently bonded an antimicro bial agent through an intermediate polyfunctional spacer moiety. The antimicrobial agent is maintained well away from the fabric surface, thereby minimizing surface effects on antimicrobial action.
