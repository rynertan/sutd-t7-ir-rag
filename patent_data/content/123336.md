# Method for checking patterns and apparatus to carry out such method.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for checking deviations in dimensions and contrast of patterns 1 which are presented for checking purposes at a practically constant speed v of a con tinuously variably adjustable magnitude, in particular of iden tical patterns 1 printed on a repetitive fixed area 3 on a strip 2 of flat carrier material 30, each pattern consisting of parallel lines of bar codes printed at predetermined mutual distances, by optically forming an image of each pattern to be checked upon a fixed format and by taking several traverse images therefrom at an angle Î² with respect to the direction 6 of the bars by means of the row s of closely arranged electrical sensing elements, said traverse images being read out seri ally and subsequently entered into an electronic arithmetic apparatus for comparison with a reference pattern.
