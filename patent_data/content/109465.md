# Multiple layer flexible sheet structure for packaging, including tubes made from such structure.

## Abstract
A multiple layer polymeric based sheet structure 10 suitable for forming dispensing tubes, has enhanced abuse resistance by incorporating a layer of oriented polypropylene 22 therein, and a layer of linear low densiry polyethylene is preferred to provide for heat sealing to make a side seam of the tube as it substantially improves stress crack resistance and resistance to generation of polydust. An exemplary multilayer structure has the following layers, in order the heat seal layer 32 , a first adhesive 30 a metal foil 28 , a second adhesive 24, 26 , the oriented polypropylene 22 , another adhesive layer based on low density polyethylene 18, 20 and additional paper and polyethylene layers 16, 14 and 12 . The strength of adhesion between the oriented polypropylene and the adjacent adhesive layers is at least 54 grams per inch 2.54 cm .
