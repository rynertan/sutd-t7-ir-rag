# IMPROVED DOUBLE LAYER ENERGY STORAGE DEVICE

## Abstract
Improved electrical double layer energy devices contain ing at least one carbon electrode are prepared by the process of adding a voltage regulating agent, such as bromide, to the electrolyte prior to making the carbon electrodes. An electrical double layer energy storage cell comprises a a positive electrode and a negative electrode wherein at least one electrode is comprised of carbon which is substantially free of adsorbed gases, in admixture with an electrolyte and a voltage regulating agent b a porous ionically conductive separator between the electrodes and c a first and a second ion insulating connector imper vious to the electrolyte wherein the first connector is electronically contacted to the positive electrode and the second connector is electronically contacted to the negative electrode.
