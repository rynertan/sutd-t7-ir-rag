# ENDOSCOPE SYSTEM

## Abstract
An endoscope system comprises an endoscope, a light source unit 30 , and an auxiliary apparatus 54, 56 such as a camera unit 56 or a dual viewing optical unit 54 . The light source unit 30 includes a discriminating circuit 50 which discriminates the kind of the auxiliary apparatus 54, 56 when the auxiliary apparatus is attached to a viewing section 6 of the endoscope 2 . The discriminating circuit 50 causes a solenoid energizing circuit 40 to drive a solenoid 42 in accordance with the kind of the additional apparatus 54, 56 , thereby moving a stop 38 to a predetermined position. In consequence, illumination light of a given intensity is led from a light source 34 into a light guide 32 of the endoscope 2 . Thus, an image can always be observed with suitable brightness through the auxiliary apparatus 54, 56 or the viewing section 6 of the endo scope 2 without regard to the attachment of the auxiliary apparatus 54, 56 , as well as to the kind thereof.
