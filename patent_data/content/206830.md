# MICROBIAL POLYSACCHARIDE ARTICLES AND METHODS OF PRODUCTION

## Abstract
Laminar polysaccharide structures, e.g., laminar microbial cellulose structures, are disclosed. These structures comprise densified planiform sheets or laminae that merge into one another and together define plural regions having reduced polysaccharide microfibril density. The disclosed laminar polysaccharide structures are derived by manipulating fibrous polysaccharide pellicles produced by microorganisms such as those of the genere Acetobacter, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, Sphaerotilus, and the like.
