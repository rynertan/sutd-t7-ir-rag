## Description
DENTIFRICE COMPOSITIONS The invention relates to dentifrice compositions. According to the present invention there is provided a dentifrice composition containing synthetic hydroxyapatite powder. The composition is preferably neutral or weakly alkaline, the preferred maximum pH value being substantially 9. It has been found that the dentifrice composition of the present invention is effective in eliminating plaque a colony of bacteria from a tooth surface and also has some fortifying and remineralizing effect on the enamel coating of the tooth. In general, a conventional dentifrice contains, as a tooth cleaning and abrading agent, a mineral, such as colloidal silica, etc. While these abrading agents are used to remove contaminants on teeth, it is essential that they do not harm the teeth. The dentifrice composition of the present invention contains a suitable amount of synthetic hydroxyapatite powder which can remove plaque as well as substances contaminating the teeth very effectively. We presume this is due to the fact that the synthetic hydroxyapatite has a hardness similar to that of the enamel portion of the tooth and can impart an appropriate abrading effect on the enamel portion during brushing of the teeth. We further presume that this is also due to the fact that the synthetic hydroxyapatite which, in preferred compositions has an average particle size of the hydroxyapatite powder of about 2p and a maximum particle size thereof 10 or less,has a large surface area and an excellent absorptivity. In accordance with the present invention the dentifrice composition may further contain 0.1 to 20 by weight of NaCl and or KCl and 0.003 to 3 by weight of MgCl2, based on the weight of the ccmposition. It has been found that the presence of a mixture ofNaCl and or Kcl with MgCl2 in a dentifrice composition containing synthetic hydroxyapatite powder can effectively promote the elimination of plaque from teeth and enhance the fortification and remineralization of the surfaces of the teeth compared with compositions without these chlorides. More specifically, the latter dentifrice composition of the present invention can deposit crystals of hydroxyapatite on the surfaces of the teeth more effectively than compositions without these chlorides. We presume this is due to the fact that the solubility of hydroxyapatite in water is increased in the presence of the chlorides specified above. More particularly, since hydroxyapatite is a salt which is only slightly soluble in water, the ion products of its ions Ca , HPO4 , etc., dissolved and ionised in water in the dentifrice, are small. This means that the ion products present for promoting coating of the surfaces of the teeth, i.e. depositing crystals of hydroxyapatite on the surfaces of the teeth, are small.If, however, NaCI and or KC1, and MgCl2 are added to the dentifrice containing hydroxyapatite, the solubilities of Ca and HPO4 are considerably increased thus, presumably, resulting in the observed enhancement of the coating effect on the teeth. In cases where the amounts of NaCl and or KCl, andMgCl2 contained in the dentifrice composition of the present invention are smaller than those specified above, iteenhancement of the coating effect, compared with that achieved by compositions of the invention without these chlorides, is insufficient to be of much advantage while, in compositions having amounts larger than those specified above, it becomes difficult to give a comfortable feeling in the use of the dentifrice composition. The dentifrice composition of the present invention may include various additives which are commonly employed in dentifrices and may further include, if desired,citric acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, pyrrolic acid, glutamine, proline, serine, glycine, etc. The invention will be further illustrated with reference to the followin. gexamples. Examples 1 to 7 and 11 to 17 respectively show formulations of the dentifrice compositions in accordance withe present invention in terms of parts by weight and Examples 8 to 10, 18 and 19 are to substantiate effects of the compositions of the present invention.

A 0.1 solution of Neutral Red was applied to the front teeth of each of three male adults A,B, and C 22 to 25 years old , who had been using conventional, commercially available dentifrices. Thereafter, a similar dyeing operation was conducted one day after they started to use the dentifrice of Example 1 and the plaque stained areas before and after the change of the dentifrice were compared. In the case of A, the stained area after the change was about 10 of the initial stained area and it was confirmed that the decontamination of the plaque areas was about 90 . In casesB and C the decontamination of the plaque areas was about 50 . Example 9. Abrasive effects of dentifrices were tested using, for teeth,plate form bodies made of sintered hydroxyapatite having a hardness similar to that of the enamel portion of a tooth. The plate form bodies were each subjected to brushing using tooth brushes and different dentifrices for 60 minutes. The losses in weights of the respective plate form bodies were measured. In the result, the abrasive effects of dentifrice compositions of the present invention were similar to those of commercially available dentifrices WHITE WHITE and DENTER LION . Example 10. An adult s permanent tooth was sliced in two using a prisma adamantinum to form a section having a thickness of about 200pm. A saturated solution of hydroxyapatite was prepared by stirring hydroxyapatite powder into distilled water in quantities equivalent to 1g hydroxyapatite per 100ml water. The supernatant liquid was passed over the prepared toothsection at a flow rate of 0.6mlXmin. The section was observed continuously with the use of a polarization microscope and it was confirmed that the section became coated with material resembling apatite crystals to a thickenss of about 1pm after 14 hours.
