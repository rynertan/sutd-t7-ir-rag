# Biomedical electrode.

## Abstract
A biomedical electrode comprises a flexible electrode plate 1 which conforms to the skin surface of a living body, and an electrically conductive adhesive layer 2 which fixes the electrode plate on the skin surface and transmits an electric signal from the living body to said electrode plate. A non contact area A to which said conductive adhesive layer is not substantially bonded is formed on the electrode plate, and an electrically conductive tongue 4 for connecting a terminal which takes said electric signal from the living body to a biomedical diagnostic appaatus is provided on the non contact area by forming a cut 3 in the non contact area.
