# SIGNAL PROCESSING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Apparatus for recording or transmitting television sig nals in component form with the components time shared and multiplexed, comprises first and second phase control loops 1, 2 to which synchronous signals separated from an input signal are fed, and a plurality of memory devices 31, 32, 33 , wherein the output of the first phase control loop 1 is used as a writing clock signal for writing the input signal into the memory devices 31, 32, 33 , and the output of the second phase control loop 2 is used as a reading clock signal for reading the contents of said memory devices 31, 32, 33 . The writing clock signal is applied to each of the plurality of memory devices 31, 32, 33 in turn in synchro nisation with the synchronous signal of the input signal, and the reading clock signal is applied to each of the plurality of memory devices 31, 32, 33 which is not applied with the writing clock signal in turn in synchronisation with the synchronous signal of the output signal. While each of the memory devices 31, 32, 33 repeats writing and reading operations alternately, the reading timing of the memory devices are not synchronised with the writing timings of the memory devices. Accordingly, the fluctuation of the input synchronous signal will not appear in the output signal.
