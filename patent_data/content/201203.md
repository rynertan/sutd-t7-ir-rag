## Description
The present invention relates to a method for regulating plant growth by applying certain aniline derivatives to the plants and or their environment and to compositions for regulating plant growth containing such compounds as an active ingredient. In the text of the present patent application, the expressions for regulating growth and growth regulators are taken to have their usual meaning, the word growth relating to the production of living material and not simply to the modification of the size of plants. Growth regulators are therefore to be understood hereafter as meaning products which are capable of modifying the physiology of plants in various ways. According to the present invention there is provided a method of regulating plant growth i.e. for modifying the physiology of plants in various ways at a locus which comprises applying to the locus an effective amount of at least one compound of the general formula I depicted in Figure I R³NHC COOR¹ CH COOR² Figure I wherein R¹ and R², which are the same, each represent a straight or branched chain alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R³ represents the phenyl group bearing substituents R⁴ and R⁵ It is to be understood that this specification is intended to embrace the E form and the Z form, which arise as a result of geometrical isomerism, and mixtures thereof. The anilinofumarates are preferred. Furthermore, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the compounds of formula I exhibit tautomerism, and that the forms thus described may be present to a greater or lesser degree and are in a state of dynamic equilibrium with each other as described by S. Toppet Preferred compounds are those where Especially preferred compounds are those where Especially important compounds of general formula I are as follows No. Compound The dose of active ingredient applied can vary according to different factors such as, for example, the type of plant or crop to be treated, its stage of development, the climatic conditions and the nature of the land. In practice, the treatments according to the invention are carried out by applying to, for example, a crop growing area doses of anilinofumarate compound ranging from 0.01 kg hectare to 20 kg hectare. Compound Nos. 1 to 11, 23 and 24 are preferred. An important method is a method which improves the yield of fruiting crops, especially cereals e.g. maize, wheat, barley and rice and brassicae e.g. oil seed rape and more especially legumes e.g. soyabean, field bean and dwarf bean , more particularly when applied at a flowering stage as a foliar spray. For this purpose, the compound of the general formula depicted in Figure 1 may suitably be applied at rates of applications of from 0.05 to 8.0 and more especially to 1.0 kg of that compound per hectare. For example, dimethyl 3,4 dichloroanilino fumarate enhances the yield of dwarf bean Tests 1 to 3 and soyabean Test 4 following application as a foliar spray, by increasing the number of pods that are set and enhancing dry matter accumulation. Seed quality may also be improved, for example oil content is increased in oil producing crops. A further important method is a method which improves the yield of cereal crops, e.g. winter wheat, when applied at a growth stage which is other than a flowering stage, for example the first node Zadoks 31 stage or flag leaf extending Zadoks 39 stage, as a foliar spray. An especially important method is a method which improves the yield of legumes grown when sub optimal conditions e.g. watered by natural rainfall prevail, more particularly when applied at or near pollination as a foliar spray.
