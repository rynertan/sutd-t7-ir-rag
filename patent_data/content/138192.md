# Method of preparing polyorganosiloxane emulsions having small particle size.

## Abstract
A method of preparing fine polyorganosiloxane emul sions with an average particle size of less than 0.3 micron and polyorganosiloxane microemulsions with an average particle size of less than 0.14 micron is described. A translucent oil concentrate is prepared by mixing a polyorganosiloxane which contains polar groups, a surfactant which is insoluble in the polyorganosiloxane, and sufficient water to obtain a translu cent mixture. The translucent oil concentrate is then rapidly dispersed in water to form the desired fine emulsion or micro emulsion. In general, if the translucent oil concentrate is not transparent a fine emulsion with an average particle size of less than 0.3 micron is obtained whereas, if the oil concentrate is transparent, a microemulsion with an average particle size of less than 0.14 micron is obtained.
