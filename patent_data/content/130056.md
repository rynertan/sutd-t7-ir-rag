## Description
FLUORINATED POLYPHENYLENES The present invention relates to novel fluorinated polyphenylenes and to a process for producing them. Production of polyphenylenes by catalytic polymerisation of benzene is well known. The polymerisation is usually effected in the presence of a catalyst comprising a strong Lewis acid and an oxidizing agent. It has also been known to produce polyphenylenes by the addition of an aryl Grignard or an aryllithium to a substituted cyclic ketone followed by dehydration and aromatisation.However, most of these processes give rise to relatively unstable or intractable products. It is also known from Aroskar E.V. et al inJ.C.S. C ply69, 1968 that charge transfer complexes may be formed between aromatic hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon rings. It has now been found that by forming a polymer in which the phenylene and fluorinated phenylene groups are present in a mixed distribution, a relatively stable product is produced. Accordingly, the present invention is a fluorinated phenylene polymer having at least four benzene nuclei in the polymer chain at least one of which is a fluorinated benzene nucleus. According to a further embodiment the present invention is a fluorinated phenylene polymer having at least four benzene nuclei in the polymer chain, said polymer containing at least one unsubstituted benzene nucleus and at least one fluorinated benzene nucleus. According to yet another embodiment the present invention is a fluorinated phenylene polymer of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R4 and R5 are identical radicals selected from H and F, R7, R8, R9, Rlo are identical radicals selected from H and F, R3 and R6 are identical or different radicals selected from H, a halogen and llthiumi n is an integer from 1 to 50, and A is a group of the formula 11 EMI2.2 in which a O to 5 b 1 to 10 c O to 5 such that a b c at least 2 Specific examples of the fluorinated phenylene polymers according to the present invention includeEMI2.3 in which p is an integer from 2 to 50.EMI3.1 The fluorinated phenylene polymers of the present invention preferably have at least 5 benzene nuclei and may be produced in various ways depending upon the reactants used and the products desired. The starting materials used may be reacted in single steps to produce the polymer or the polymerisation may be carried out step wise . By single step polymerisation is meant a process in which one or more reactants fromEMI3.2 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 50EMI3.3 in which A n has the same notation as in formula I above, is reacted with one or more ofEMI3.4 EMI4.1 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 50EMI4.2 in which the group A n is the same as in formula I above. Alternatively, one or more of the compounds of formula XVIII to XX EMI4.3 where n is an integer from 1 to 50EMI4.4 in which A n is the same as before in formula I are condensed together with the elimination of LiF to form the desired polymer. In the other method of step wise polymerisation, one or more compounds of the formulae XXI to XXIV EMI4.5 where n is an integer from 1 to 50EMI4.6 wnere x is a najogen preterably Br or 1 is converted to a corresponding half lithiated derivative and then reacted with one or more of the compounds illustrated in formulae XIV XVII above. Whether the polymer is produced by a single step reaction or by step wise polymerisation, it is preferable to carry out the reaction with a solvent present. The solvent used is preferably inert under the reaction conditions and may be selected from tetrahydrofuran, diethylether and the like. The reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature from 100 to 100 C, more preferably from 70 to 70 C. The products of the reaction may be washed with water and recovered thereafter by removal of the solvent. The products so produced may have phenyl or halophenyl end groups or a lithophenyl end group if washing with water is excluded. Such products may be further reacted with known reagents to introduce desired functional or other groupings using standard techniques for reacting halophenyls or lithiophenyls. Polymers produced in this manner have inherent electrical properties although in some cases this may not be noticeable to any significant extent. The polymers of the present invention may however be doped using conventional dopants such as the halogens, fluorides of arsenic, halides of molybdenum or protonic acids to enhance their conducting properties. The polymers of the present invention may be produced in film or powder form and therefore find wide applicability in uses needing stable, conducting polymers. The polymers and polymerisation process of the present invention are further illustrated with reference to the accompanyingExamples.
