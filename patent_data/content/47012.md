# Centrifugal fan control.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a vehicle having an engine 20 transversely mounted for rocking motion relative to the vehicle frame 42 an engine cooling radiator 22 mounted forwardly of the engine and substantially parallel to the rotational axis of the engine crankshaft a cross flow fan 24 having a rotational axis fixed against movement relative to the vehicle frame, substantially parallel to the crankshaft axis, and between the crankshaft axis and the plane of the radiator a belt drive 32, 34, 36 for rotating the fan in response to rotation of the crankshaft means 100 or 120 for maintain ing the belt tension relatively constant when the engine rocks and means 29 or 121 to vary the fan speed relative to the crankshaft speed in response to the cooling requirements of the engine. In one embodiment the tensioning means is incorporated in split pulley 36 of the beft drive, in the other embodiment the tensioning means is a spring load idler pulley 120 . In one embodiment the means to vary the fan speed in response to cooling requirements is a viscous coupling, in the other embodiment it is an electromagnetic clutch.
