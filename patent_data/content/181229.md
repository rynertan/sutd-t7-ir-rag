# Cathode.

## Abstract
A cathode comprises an active layer composed of a nickel tin alloy having a nickel content of 25 to 99 by weight, which is formed on the surface of an electrically conductive electrode substrate. When this cathode is used for generating hydrogen by the electrolysis, the hydrogen overvoltage is controlled to a very low level. This active layer is formed by co electro deposition of Ni and Sn from a plating solution containing Ni and Sn ions or by thermal decomposition of a mixture containing a nickel compound and a tin compound.
