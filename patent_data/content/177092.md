# REACTION BONDED SHAPES OF TITANIUM DIBORIDE

## Abstract
Titanium diboride shaped articles for use in aluminum reduction cells are produced by reaction bonding a shaped mixture of titanium dioxide, boron carbide and carbon, or titanium dioxide, boron oxide and carbon by heating a mixutre of the reactants to a temperature in the range 2100 2300 C under vacuum or argon. The carbon may be in the form of a carbon black and when boron carbide is used it is present in a 7 12 stoichiometric excess with a 3 9 stoichiometric deficiency of carbon.
