# Wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity.

## Abstract
A wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity is described, comprising a sachet 2 of thermo plastic material bordered by walls, one of which is heat sealed after a suitably shaped pad 1 of porous material has been inserted in the sachet 2 and soaked in liquid, in order to close the sachet 2 hermetically one wall 3 of notable thickness, containing in one corner a cavity 4 which concerns a part very close to the external surface of the wall 3 a tearing indicator notch 5 which is developed on a plane transversally intersecting the wall 3 thereby dividing it into two parts the first part of which is manually removable the second containing that part of the cavity 4 which assumes the form of a pouring spout 4a .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity, preferably comprising a dose of a liquid pro duct, for example a medicinal product, foodstuff, cos metic, detergent or similar, comprising at least a sachet 2 of thermo plastic material bordered by a pre determined number of walls,in which sachet 2 a suit ably shaped pad 1 is hermetically enclosed by means of heat sealing along any one of the said walls, the said pad 1 preferably consisting of synthetic porous ma terial to absorb the product which is introduced into the wrapping, characterised by the fact that the said sachet 2 comprises one wall 3 which has a greater thickness with respect to the thickness of the other walls and in which a cusp shaped cavity 4 is cut, con cerning one corner of the said wall 3 but not the other walls of the said sachet 2 the said cavity 4 being extended to a part of the wall 3 very near to the external surface of the said wall 3 and housing a part of the said pad 1 a tearing indicator notch 5 being cut into the said wall 3 and being developed along a plane transversally intersecting the wall 3 dividing it into two parts the first part being manually removable the second containing that part of the said cavity 4 which, having removed the first part, remains in the wrapping assuming the form of a spout 4a thereby making it easier to pour the liquid from the wrapping into a suitable container.

## Description
WRAPPING FOR CONTAINING LIQUID PRODUCTS OF DIFFERINGVISCOSITYThe invention refers to a wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity, that is to a wrapping of the type comprising a sachet of thermo plastic material, hermetically closed by means of heat sealing, enclosed in which is a pad which can be soaked with various types of products, such as medicinal products, foodstuffs, cosmetics, lubricants, detergents, etc.All the known wrappings of the above mentioned type generally contain a single dose of the pre selected liquid products since, once open, they do not guarantee a hermetic seal and it is thus necessary for the contents to be used completely or transferred to another suitable container after the opening of the said wrapping, which serves to contain the liquid during transportation or warehouse storage.Among the various uses of the known types of these wrappings, is one for which the pouring operation of the liquid into the container does not require particular care if, in fact, a container is used which has a notably sized opening, such as a bucket, a basin or similar then there is no risk of wasting the liquid by spilling it outside the container there are, however, certain uses of the known type of these wrappings for which the pouring operation of the liquid into the container requires particular care this is the case when containers with a small opening are used, such as small bottles or ampoules, and when the quantity of the liquid must be carefully measured to a pre determined value, as in the case of medicinal products or cosmetics in this case it is easy to waste the liquid either by spilling it outside the container or, if the container remains open, from inside the said container, the liquid losing its effectiveness.There are also wrappings with measuring spouts which make it easier to pour the product thereby preventing waste through spillage outside the container or due to incorrect dosage. The spouts of this type consist of extensions of the wrappings turned outwards, these being exposed to the danger of breakage or unwanted opening should the wrapping receive a blow or be dropped. They are also exposed to receive particles of dust or other substances in the air which can pollute the liquid when poured out.This invention is aimed at overcoming these difficulties.As characterised in the claim, the invention solves the problem of creating a wrapping for containing liquid products of differing viscosity and which makes it possible to transfer the contents to containers with small openings without the danger of spilling any outside the said container of suffering no damage in the case of falls or blows of having a spout protected from dust and other polluting agents contained in the air.The advantages derived from this invention are basically the consequence of protecting the pouring spout by means of a wall of suitable thickness, the said spout consisting of a cusp shaped cavity in the said wall, with a tearing indicator notch which is developed longitudinally along the said wall to permit the partial removal of the same along a median plane which includes the said cusp.The invention is shown in greater detail, by referring to the drawings which represent, each one to a particular scale, one non limiting method of exexution, in which Fig. 1 represents a view of the wrapping according to this invention, as seen from above Fig. 2 explains the opening operations of the said wrapping Fig. 3 shows how the liquid is poured from the said wrapping into a small bottle, not shown.In compliance with the above mentioned figures, the wrapping consists of a sachet 2, of thermo plastic material, which contains a suitable shaped pad 1 inside it and which is made from synthetic sponge type material to absorb liquid products with a greater or lesser degree of viscosity. The sachet 2 has one wall 3, the thickness of which is notably greater than the thickness of the other walls and in which a cusp shaped cavity 4 is cut, concerning one corner of the wall 3 but not the other walls of the sachet 2 the said cavity 4 extending towards the outside of the wall 3, very near to its external surface and housing part of the pad 1.Once the pad 1 has been soaked in liquid, the sachet 2 is hermetically closed by means of heat sealing along one of its walls, for instance the one opposite the wall 3. A tearing indicator notch 5 is cut in the wall 3 and developed along a plane which transversally intersects the wall 3, dividing it into two parts, the first of which is removed manually as shown in fig. 2 and the second of which concerns that part of the cavity 4 which remains in the wrapping when the first part has been removed the said cavity 4 taking the form of a spout 4a.As can be seen in fig. 3, the spout 4a is freed by the removal of the said first part and allows the liquid to be transferred with precision from the wrapping which is the subject of this invention into the bottle below, with a controlled and uniform flow thereby avoiding wastage due to inaccurate transfer of the liquid into the small opening of the bottle.
