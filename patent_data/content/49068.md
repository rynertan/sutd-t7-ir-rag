# Solid dose ballistic projectile.

## Abstract
A solid dose ballistic projectile formed almost entirely of a cohesive mixture of biologically active material, in the form of grindable solid particles having an average diameter between about 7 and 25 micrometers, and biologically inert binder. These projectiles are capable of containing more active medi cament than conventional ballistically implantable projectiles. The projectiles, even those made up of up to 95 percent medica ment, are capable of withstanding the stresses imparted thereon when the projectile is propelled ballistically from a bar rel and implanted in the flesh of a living animal. The ability of these projectiles to withstand such stresses is due to the pro jectile composition, including the particle size of the medica ment. These projectiles are used to administer medication to animals such as cattle and free ranging animals.
