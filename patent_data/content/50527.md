## Description
Process and Apparatus for Reacting SulphurContaining Material with Oxidising Gas The present invention relates to a catalytic process for reacting hydrogen sulfide H2S or elemental sulfur with air or oxygen. The invention is particularly advantageous for carrying out these reactions at elevated pressures or when using pure oxygen. Temperature in the catalyst bed may be controlled so that the reactor can be constructed of conventional metals without refractory lining. The process is most useful as the first stage of a process for the production of sulfur from gas containing H2S by partial oxidation, for producing sulfur dioxide S02 as a first stage in the production of sulfur trioxide or sulfuric acid from elemental sulfur, and for the production of both sulfur and carbon dioxide from lean acid gases. The following are examples of. prior art processes where the present invention can be used to great advantage i Conventional Sulfur Recovery from Acid Gases Sour gas is a term applied to the products of gas wells which contain hydrogen sulfide or to gas from industrial sdurces such as the hydrodesulfurization unit of an oil refinery. Hydrogen sulfide H2S must be removed from sour gas before such gases can be used or vented to the atmosphere, for environmental and safety reasons. Usually sour gas containing H2S is passed into an absorption unit wherein the B2S is absorbed in a liquid. The liquid is then regenerated in a separate vessel to produce a mixture of gases at about atmospheric pressure. This mixture of gases is termed an acid gas. It is a gas containing H2S which may also contain substantial quantities of carbon dioxide and lesser amounts of water vapour, methane, ammonia and other chemicals. A conventional process for converting H2S in the acid gas to water vapour and sulfur is a process generally known as the Claus process. It is a low pressure process involving the following net reaction H2S O2 H20 S 1 This reaction is usually accomplished in two stages by a process known as the Hodified Claus Process.First, a portion of the H2S in the acid gas stream is reacted with air in a free flame combustion furnace, as follows 1 3 H2S 02 µ 1 3 S02 1 3 H20 2 The remaining H2S is then reacted with the S02 produced in the furnace in a catalytic reactor, with a suitable catalyst such as activated alumina, as follows 2 3 H2S 1 3 SO2 2 3 H2O 1 nSn 3 where Sn is a complex molecular mixture of elemental sulfur vapour and n the average number of atoms in a molecule usually has 2 value of between 7 and B for conditions in the catalytic reactor.Conditions are maintained in the catalytic reactor so that temperatures never fall below the dev point of sulfur vapour and sulfur is prevented from condensing and plugging the catalyst. Sulfur is condensed and removed in a separate vessel and the process gases H2S and S02 are reheated for further catalytic stages. Production of sulfur by reaction 3 is favored by a reduction of temperature. both reactions 2 and 3 occur to some extent in the combustion furnace and both reactions are exothermic. However, the first stage of the process reaction 2 is a free flame combustion which requires high temperatures for initiation and complete oxygen utilization. Flame temperatures can be as high as 1350 C but are normally between about 900 and 12500C. The fact that the temperature in the furnace must be high, and the fact that large amounts of heat are produced give rise to practical problems in the construction of a suitable furnace and waste heat boiler ie. refractory insulation in the furnace and the boiler as well as the use of alloy steels are required. Also, the conventional process requires a minimum proportion of H2S in the gas at about 40 percent by volume, below which combustion is not selfsupporting. In certain prior art processes, a catalyst has been used to carry out reaction 2 . Catalyst use is particularly advantageous for non ignitable acid gases ie. with less than 40 H2S . However, since the temperatures and oxygen levels are high, the catalyst is subject to sintering, phase changes and sulfate formation, which poison the the catalyst and lower its activity. The temperature is always maintained above the sulfur dewpoint, since condensation of sulfur on the catalyst is known to inhibit the reactions due to catalyst pore blockage. Commercial processes using this vapour phase catalytic furnace have been unsuccessful. The conventional Claus process is operated at near atmospheric pressure. Although the benefits of pressure on process yields are evident from equation 3 , the necessity of maintaining super dewpoint operation requires increased temperatures in the catalytic reactors which decrease process yields. The net effect of increased pressure and increased temperature is decreased yields, and consequently operation of a Claus plant at elevated pressures has not been practised commercially. Elevated pressure operation of Claus reaction furnace also poses some difficulty, High temperature gases must be contained, at pressure, by a refractory lined vessel. Added to this difficulty is the risk of loss of flame and the sub sequent accumulation of explosive gas mixtures. In addition, some prior art processes for removing H2S from gas mixtures have used low temperature catalyst beds in which sulfur may be produced as a liquid. However, these have not been widely used because the rate of reaction is low. ii Sulfur Recovery from Lean Acid Gases A lean acid gas is an acid gas that contains a substantia amount of Cho2, usually greater than about 60 percent, so that the acid gas cannot sustain a free flame in a Claus process furnace. For proper stoichiometry only 1 3 of the B2S need be combusted to form 5 2 2 In practice, there are seeral approaches to solve this problem, namely a Preheat the acid gas and or air to increase flame temperatures in the furnace. b Add and combust a gas such as methane in the same furnace to increase temperatures. c By pass a portion of the acid gas around the furnace 2 3 maximum to increase furnace flame temperatures. d By pass an acid gas furnace altogether by burning a portion of product sulfur to produce S02 in a sulfur burner, co mixing the SO2 with acid gas and injecting the mixture to the catalytic section of a conventional Claus plant. For very lean acid gases less than about 15 H2S only methods b and d are possible. In practice each or a combination of these methods has had limited success. Problems associated with the methods are as follows e It is important for continuing activity of catalyst in the conventional Claus and associated processes, that no S03 be formed in the furnace and that no molecular oxygen be present in the furnace effluent gases. The S03 and or 02 will form sulfates and poison Claus catalyst so that it becomes inactive to promote reaction 3 . methods b , c , and d above all have the disadvantage of increasing the possibility of S03 production and or oxygen breakthrough to doumstream catalytic reactors. f Methods a , b , and c above all suffer one flaw. Flame temperatures are low and the risk of oxygen break through to downstream catalyst is significant. Method c partial acid gas by pass suffers the additional problem of decreasing reductant concentrations H2S in the furnace so that SO3 formation is also more likely. g The SO3 formation can also lead to the formation of solid sulfates in the condenser sections of the Claus plant. These sulfates can either plug condensers or plug sulfur burner nozzles when recycled to a burner as in d . h In a sulfur burner recycle system described above d , about one third of the sulfur to the process comes from recycled sulfur. Thus, the plant capacity to treat acid gas is reduced by 1 3 compared with direct acid combustion methods. In order to try to minimize some of the above problems and to reduce high sulfur burner flame temperatures, sulfur is normally combusted with air in an atmosphere of excess sulfur. The excess sulfur is passed downstream as sulfur vapour which must be removed or it will inhibit reaction 3 . Because of mixing limitations with the sulfur flame, this approach is not always successful. iii Sulfur and Carbon Dioxide Recovery from Acid Gas If pure oxygen or substantially pure oxygen is used in a process to carry out reactions 2 and 3 , the tail gas from the process would contain CO2 from the acid gas and water vapour with only small amounts of unreacted H2S and SO2 and other trace components.Carbon dioxide could be recovered by simply condensing and removing the water vapour in the tail gas. However, a conventional Claus process cannot conveniently use oxygen rather than air in its combustion furnace. For rich acid gases the nitrogen in air is necessary to quench flame temperatures to manageable levels. For example, for a 100 H2S acid gas, flame temperatures to carry out reaction 2 only combusting 1 3 of the acid gas in pure oxygen are about 3200 C. Gases at such temperatures cannot be contained within conventional refractory vessels. A lean acid gas for example 25 h2S, 75 C02, would have a flame temperature of about 1000 C. This is about the minimum temperature to sustain a free flame. Acid gases with less H2S would have to use some of the techniques mentioned previously.Lean acid gases, containing significant amounts of C02, have the largest incentive for C02 recovery. iv Sulfuric Acid The present invention can also be used to react oxygen or oxygen containing gases with elemental sulfur to produce sulfur dioxide gas reaction 3A and may be useful for such processes described herein and following S S 02 µ SO2 3A Sulfur dioxide gas is used to produce sulfuric acid by further reaction with oxygen as follows SO2 5 2 t SO2 4 SO3 H2O H2S04 5 Reaction 4 is an exothermic equilibrium reaction favored by low temperatures. It is normally conducted in several catalytic stages with heat removal at the end of each stage. Reacticn 5 is also exothermic and heavily favored at temperatures below about 5000C.Obviously, by Le Chatelier s principle, SC3 production is favored by high pressure operation, or by pure oxygen utilization rather than air To date, production of 502 at pressure has been limited by conventional equipment capabilities. A stoichiometric sulfur flame has an adiabatic flame temperature of about 18000C in air or 53000C in pure O2. If excess oxygen suitable for reaction 4 is included, flame temperatures are about 1300 C in air and 4050 C in pure oxygen.Sulfur oxygen flame temperatures are too high for use in a conventional furnace. Air sulfur flames either must be contained in a refractorylined vessel 6r flame temperatures must be quenched by the addition of either excess air or sulfur to the combustion chamber. In the former case, of excess air , the excess gas must be contained and processed in down stream equipment. In the latter case, the excess sulfur is carried downstream as a vapour and is removed in a waste heat boiler sulfur condenser. In any case, the heat from the sulfur flame is removed in a separate waste heat recovery boiler. Operation at elevated pressures is complicated by the necessity to contain high temperature gases in a refractory lined vessel. Added to these difficulties is the risk of loss of flame and the subsequent build up of explosive gas mixture. v Sulfur Trioxide Pyrosulfuric acid or oleum is rapidly becoming an important industrial chemical. It has the obvious advantages over sulfuric acid in that it reduces the transportation costs associated with water compare reactions 4 and 5 . Oleum is normally produced by absorbing SO3 with concentrated H2S04. Limited partial pressures of S03 diluted by N2 in a conventional sulfuric acid plant inhibit this absorption. In comparison, a pressurized process or a process using pure 2 rather than air could allow more efficient absorption or even direct condensation of S03, because of the higher S03 partial pressure. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION When included as a step or stage in the foregoing processes, the present invention reduces many of the drawbacks associated with the prior art processes. The present invention is a process in which H2 S or elemental sulfur and a gas containing free oxygen are continuously introduced into a reactor having a bed of solid catalyst that is maintained continuously completely saturated with liquid sulfur Hydrogen sulfide is reacted according to reactions 2 and 3 elemental sulfur is oxidized to produce SO2 reaction 3A .The temperature within the catalyst bed is controlled to be between about 3000C and 550 C except for H2 S reactions at pressures higher than atmospheric in which case the lower limit temp erature can be significantly reduced. The range of temperatures which is between 2750C and 5500C includes temperatures higher than those previously used in cases where sulfur is produced as a liquid but lower than those found in a free flame furnace. As a result of low temperatures and flameless operation, it is possible to use standard non refractorv construction materials. Slore importantly, contrary to expectations based on previous experience for catalytic H2S furnaces, it has been found that when the catalyst is saturated or soaked with liquid sulfur, it does not lose its catalytic activity, as it is protected from sulfation, sintering and phase changes by the liquid sulfur.Soaked catalyst and excess amounts of liquid sulfur also inhibits the formation of SO3 by converting any SO3 to S02 via reaction 6 2SO3 3502 . 6 It has also been found that liquid sulfur itself provides a medium for reactions 2 , 3 , and 4 to occur, but that it is not as effective as a liquid soaked catalyst especially at lower reactor temperatures. The liquid sulfur also provides a convenient and effective means for cooling the catalyst bed and provides the means fpr allowing the reactions to take place at optimum temperatures and which are such that the reaction vessels can be formed from metals without refractory lining. The use of liquid sulfur as a coolant allows the reactions and heat recovery to proceed in the same vessel at the same time. Furthermore, the process can conveniently be operated at elevated pressures with attendant advantages therein. In the case of H2S, it has been found that the process is more effective at higher pressures, especially above 5 atmospheres absolute preferred pressures are between 5 and 50 atmospheres absolute. Since the boiling point of sulfur is 444.6 C and this temperature is included within the preferred range 3OO0c to 5500C , pressures above atmospheric may be necessary to ensure the presence of liquid sulfur in the reactor and to ensure catalyst saturation with liquid sulfur. Furthermore, the present invention can use pure oxygen or enriched air, rather than air, as a source of oxygen without affecting the temperature in the reaction vessel. The H2S may be contained in an acid gas introduced into the reactor, and which preferably has more than 1 H2S v v .

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIlfENTS Examples of the foregoing processes, as improved by utilizing the present invention as a stage or step, are given below. i Sulfur Recovery from Acid Gas The discovery that, given suitable operating conditions, u catalyst retains its activity for promoting reactions between sulfur compounds and other compounds, specifically hydrogen sulfide and or elemental sulfur and oxygen, when soaked with liquid sulfur, is unexpected. It also provides the basis for the invention described in our copendingEuropeanPatent Application 80304343.9 filed December 3,1980. This latter invention is concerned with the second step of the conventional Claus process in which H2S and S02 react to produce sulfur reaction 3 .The process of the present invention when used in the oxidation of H2 S can conveniently be used to replace the first, furnace stage of a conventionalClaus plant, for reaction 2 , while the process described in European Application.80304343 replaces the second or catalytic stage of such a plant reaction 3 . In the latter invention, a supply of sulfur is provided which can be circulated to the present invention for temperature control. In fact, it is preferred that there be an interchange of liquid sulfur between the two. Preferably a bubble or a trickle bed reactor with fixed catalyst bed will be used for the present invention however a slurry reactor, which is a bubble reactor where the catalyst is unconstrained by screens, may also be used.Cooling may be provided directly by regulating the amount of cooled liquid sulfur to the bed or indirectly by placing cooling coils in or around the catalyst bed. In either case, if necessary, liquid sulfur is injected onto the catalyst bed to maintain atll of the catalyst continuously soaked with sulfur liquid. In the case of a bubble reactor liquid sulfur inflows are regulated to maintain the catalyst submerged in liquid sulfur. Referring to Figure 1, the furnace reactor is a bubble reactor vessel 15 in the form of a cylinder containing a fixed bed 27 of solid catalyst held in place by screens. Since the temperature within this vessel will be less than about 5500 C, the vessel can be made of metal without refractory lining. The vessel has a bottom outlet 17 for hot liquid sulfur, stream 14 and bottom inlets 18 and 19 respectively for acid gas and compressed air streams 1 and 2 . Acid gas and air are compressed by compressors 20 and 21 to a pressure of about 10 atm. absolute. The ratio of air to acid gas flow is controlled by flow ratio controller 22 so that the effluent gases leaving the reactor contain H2 S and S02 in the ratio of 2 1 by volume and are thus in correct stoichiometry for reaction 3 .The reactor vessel has a top exit 23 for reacted gases 3 and a top inlet 24 for cooling sulfur 10 provided by sulfur pump 25. The level of liquid sulfur in the reactor is controlled by level controller 26 to maintain all the catalyst soaked and submerged in liquid sulfur. The temperature of the reactor is controlled by the coolant sulfur flow, 10. In operation, an initial quantity of hot liquid sulfur is introduced into the reactor via pipe 24, this being sufficient to completely soak and immerse the catalyst, to heat the catalyst to about 300 C, and to form a liquid layer in the reactor reaching up to a level higher than the top of the catalyst bed. If necessary an external heat source may be provided to heat the submerged catalyst to about 3000C. Then controlled quantities of H2 S and air are introduced into the reactor via pipes 18 and 19, bubbling up through the liquid sulfur and catalyst while reacting.The temperature of the liquid sulfur initially introduced is sufficient to start the reaction. The reactor temperature rises to about 3900C from the heat of the reaction. Some or all of reactions 2 , 3 , and 3A occur within the catalyst bed in the reactor. Although it is difficult to determine which reactions are occurring at which stage, it is known from experiments that the overall reactions will result in production of sulfur and consumption of oxygen. Consumption of oxygen is the key parameter in the evaluation of the performance of the reactor. The reacted gases stream 3 , saturated in sulfur vapour and containing stoichiometric amounts of n2S and S02 for reaction 3 pass to the top 16a of reactor 16, which is similar to that described in our previous Application No. 80304343.9 reference is made to this earlier application for further details. Reactor 16 contains 3 catalyst beds 28, 29, and 30 with means for cooling each independently provided by pumps 31, 32 and 33 which supply liquid sulfur streams 7, 8 and 9 to the tops of the bed. Level controllers 35, 36, and 37 control the removal of the heated coolant liquid sulfur and the product sulfur in streans 11, 12 and 13 so that no gas is removed with the liquid. The process gases are cooled and reacted in each of the 3 successive stages and exit the reactor in line 40. Any sulfur liquid mist present in the tail gas is removed by centrifugal scrubber 42. The pressure in the process vessels is controlled by pressure controller 44. Tail gas stream 6 can then be further treated or incinerated and vented to the atmosphere.The sulfur in streams 11, 12, 13 and from the centrifugal scrubber 42 passes through a trim cooler 45. The valve arrangement 46, allows the cooled sulfur to be recycled to reactor 15 or to be sent to storage. The process as shown in Figure 1 can be used to recover sulfur fron both lean and rich acid gases.

Oxygen and acid gas are compressed by compressors 50 and 51. The flow of oxygen is controlled by flow ratio controller 52 to maintain process stoichiometry such that the proportions of H2S and SO2 passing into the second reactor are in a ratio of 2 1 by volume. Vessel 53 is a single vertical, cylindrical process vessel to carry out reactions 2 and 3 .Oxygen, and acid gas enter at the top at 54 and 55. The acid gas is preferably a lean acid gas with H2S content between about 1 and 40 , the remaining major constituent being C02. Coolant sulfur is added at 56 to maintain all the catalyst continuously soaked with sulfur. A catalyst, for example, vanadium pent oxide, is held in place to form a bed 57 retained by suitable screens. Gases and liquid sulfur pass co currently downward through the catalyst bed. Heat is removed both by hot liquid sulfur leaving as stream 58 and by a steam jacket 59 around the catalyst bed. The gases then pass through 3 successive catalytic stages 60, 61, 62 with flow arrangements similar to those in Figure 1, and these stages are operated as described in Application 80304343.9 to produce H20 and liquid sulfur. For the purpose of simplicity, sulfur coolant and drawdown flouts and controls are omitted . The tail gases exit from the reactor at 64, pass through a cooler condenser 65 and into a phase separator 66. The water and sulfur that condense from the tail gas, are removed from phase. separator 66 as condensate stream 67. This condensate is passed through valve 69 to reduce pressure to substantially atmospheric and passes into flash tank 70. Gases flashed from the condensate are passed through line 71 and compressor 72 to be recycled through acid gas compressor 51. Condensate from the flash tank is removed in line 73 for further treatment or disposal, as necessary.The tail gas 68 is now substantially pure CO iii Sulfur Trioxide Dioxide Production Figure 3 depicts a third preferred embodiment of our invention a catalytic furnace sulfur condenser to produceSO2 uncontaminated with SO3 and a process to further react said SO2 with unreacted oxygen to produce SO3. Air or pure oxygen is compressed by compressor 80 to enter reactor 82 at inlet 81. The air or oxygen bubbles up through catalyst bed 83 containing, for example, vanadium pentoxide catalyst, and reacts with liquid sulfur to produce sulfur dioxide.Liquid sulfur enters the top of the reactor at 84, the sulfur being provided both as a coolant to control reactor temperatures at about 4000C, and as a feedstock for oxidation to S02. Hot liquid sulfur is removed from the reactor at 85. Level controller 86 controls sulfur removal to maintain a level of liquid sulfur in the reactor above the top of catalyst bed 83. Gases exit the reactor by line 88. The gases contain SO2, N2 if air is used in compresser 80 and unreacted 0 2 if desired and are saturated in sulfur vapour. The presence of liquid sulfur in the reactor is sufficient to prevent the formation of S03. The exit gases in line 88 are fed into a cooler 89 which cools the gases to condense substantially all of the sulfur vapour to sulfur liquid. The liquid is collected and removed in phase separator 90. Gases exit phase separator 90 in line 91 and contain S02, N2 if air is used in compressor 80 and unreacted 2 if desired . If pure oxygen is used and all the oxygen is substantially reacted in reactor 82, line 91 would contain substantially pure S02, uncontaminated with S03. For the purpose of production of S03, the air or oxygen flow to reactor 82 and the temperature in reactor 82 are controlled to only partially react the oxygen in reactor 82 to supply stoichiometric amounts of S02 and 0, 2 for S03 production. Even with partial reaction of the oxygen, the presence of liquid sulfur in reactor 82 is sufficient to inhibit S03 formation in this vessel. In this case, line 91 contains SO2, N2 if desired and unreacted 02.These gases are passed to a conventional catalytic reactor 92 which has a catalyst which causes the S02 to react with the oxygen to produce SO . This reactor may be cooled to cause the reaction between S02 and oxygen to go to near completion, and the gases supplied to reactor 92 may have a pressure greater than 5 atm. absolute. If 2 is used, line 91 contains S02 and unreacted 2 and the products from reactor 92 in line 93 would containSO3 and unreacted SO2 and O2. The gases would pass through cooler 94 to condense some or all of the SO3 which would be removed in phase separator 95. Gases from this phase separator would either be vented through vent line 97 or recycled by compressor 96 through line 98 to reactor 92. Figure 3a shows a variation of the apparatus of Figure 3 to be used when SO2is the desired product. The apparatus up to line 91 is the same as that of Figure 3 and corresponding parts have the same reference numerals. Pure oxygen is used as the feedstock so that line 91 contains substantially pure S02 this is condensed in condenser 99 and removed by separator 100 in line 101. The residual gases after removal of SO2 pass via line 103 either back to reactor 32 for further processing, or may be purged through valve 104. V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Figure 4 is a sectional drawing of the apparatus used in the experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of catalyst when soaked with liquid sulfur. The apparatus includes a cylindrical vessel llOhaving a top inlet 112 for liquid sulfur, and an inlet pipe arrangement including an outer pipe 114 connected to a source of acid gas, and an inner pipe 116 which is connected to a source of air or oxygen. Both of these pipes pass through a catalyst bed 118 held between screensl20 and 122, and terminate at a point fairly close to the bottom of the vessel. A stand pipe 123 leads from above screen 122 to a gas outlet 124 having a device 125 for sulfur vapour condensation, a sample port126, and a scrubber 127.Liquid sulfur was injected through line 112 and reactor sulfur level was controlled by the stand pipe 123 to be at level L above the top screen 122 of the catalyst bed. The reactor was filed with 300 ml of 3x6 mesh KA 201 activated alumina catalyst and the reactor volume to the top of the liquid sulfur was about 700 ml. Means for heating the vessel and regulating its temperature were also provided. A series of experiments was performed with this apparatus using a mixture of CO and H2S, or CO alone injected 2 2 2 through tube 114 and with air or oxygen introduced through tube 116 Two cases were studied Case 1 to simulate reaction 2 for oxidizing H2S and Case 2 to simulate an oxidation furnace to produce S02 for a sulfuric acid plant. In the latter case CO2 was used as a diluent gas and to facilitate gas chromatographic analyses. Table 3 presents the composite inlet gas compositions and flows for the experiments.

N2 27 32.5 CO2 49 59.0 H25 17 Gas plow 70 55 ml sec STP A series of experiments was performed with this apparatus at temperatures increased in stages from about 250 to 530 C. Neasure ments were taken of percentage oxygen consumed, the percentage of sulfur in the H2S which was converted to elemental sulfur via reaction 3 , the amount of sulfur dioxide produced as a percentage of B2S consumed, and the percentage of H2S consumed the latter measurements were performed only for Case 1 . Analyses were performed by standard gas chromatography techniques. Of these quantities, probably the most important is the oxygen consumption since this is the best measure of the effectiveness of the process. Figure 5 shows the oxygen consumption for Case 1 versus temperature for various reactor pressures. As can be seen from Figure 5, at low . 1.3 atmospheres absolute pressures 5 psig oxygen consumption rises from about 50 percent at 345 C to about 100 percent at 410 C. As the system pressure is increased, oxygen utilization is substantially improved at 100 psig 7.5 atmospheres absolute O pressure oxygen consumption rises from about 50 percent at 290 C to about 100 percent at 3900C. Higher system pressure therefore allows complete oxygen utilization at lower reactor temperature. Since the gases in a bubble reactor have approximately a constant residence time, independent of pressure at a given temperature, increased oxygen utilization is an indication that pressure increases the reaction rates.This was an unexpected and unforeseen result. It was also demonstrated in the experiments, for Case 1, that a considerablg amount of sulfur could be produced via reaction 3 .Table 4 presents a typical per formance at desirable conditions.

Experiments were also performed, for comparison, with the same apparatus without catalyst. As shown in Figure 6, without the soaked catalyst in the bubble reactor, oxgen 1.3 atmospheres absolute utilization at 3000C was about 8 percent at 5 psig 14.5 atmospheres absolute pressure, increasing to 40 percent at 200 psig However, with catalyst in the reactor, the percent oxygen utilization was much higher under 1.3 atmospheres absolute all conditions, starting out at 25 percent at 5 psiand increasing to 14.5 atmospheres absolute over 90 percent at 200 psig . Furthermore, oxygen utilization increases at a faster rate with respect to pressure when soaked.catalyst is present in the reactor. Similar results were also obtained using vanadium pentoxide as a catalyst. As shown in Figure 7, for Case 2 elemental sulfur oxidation oxygen consumption rises from about 20 percent at 3000C to about 100 percent at 4000C. As the system pressure is increased, oxygen utilization is substantially unaffected. Figure 8 shows, in more detail, the independence of oxygen usage on system pressures. This behaviour is in sharp contrast to H2S oxidation Case 1 and to H2S, SO2 reactions 3 which. are improved by increasing pressure. However, this non dependence of yields on pressure can be taken as an independent proof that bubble reactors have gas phase residence times that are substantially independent of pressure. Figure i also shows two experimental results for the apparatus without any catalyst present. As in Case 1, it is evident that liquid sulfur itself exhibits some catalytic activity, but that it is not as effective as sulfur soaked catalyst. Again the key parameter of process effectiveness is the consumption of oxygen. Table 5 presents a typical performance at desired conditions.
