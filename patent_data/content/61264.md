Detailed Description of the Invention This invention will hereinafter be described in detail. As mentioned hereinbefore, the compounds according to this invention may be represented by the following general formula A EMI4.1 wherein Z11 S2 ... Z8 are substituent groups attached to C17 C2, , C8, respectively, of 11, 11, 12, 12 tetracyano 9, lO anthraquinodimethane TCNAQ .More particularly, Z2, Z3 Z6 and Z7 each is H, halogen, alkyl, phenyl, alkylphenyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyalkyl, hydroxy, amino or carboxy Z1, Z Z5 and 8 each is H,C1, hydroxy or amino. The halogen referred to above may be fluorine, chlorine,bromine or iodine. The number of carbon atoms contained in said alkyl, alkylphenyl, hydroxyalkyl or carboxyalkyl may be 1 to 8. The TCNAQ compounds A have a tetracyanoanthraquinodimethane skeleton in common and display excellent characteristics due to the electronic structure characteristic of the benzene rings located at both sides of the tetra cyanoanthraquinodimethane skeleton. The term tetracyanoanthraquinodimethane skeleton as used herein denotes the skeletal structure consisting of carbon and nitrigon atoms constituting the molecule of TCNAQ. Now, the characteristics of the tetracyanoanthraquinodi methane skeleton constituting the cardinal structure of the compounds of this invention will be explained and theTCNAQ compounds will be compared with TCNQ and TCNNQ com pounds. The tetracyanDanthraquinodimethane skeleton has the following features. a It has a tetracyanoquinodimethane nucleus b One or more substltuents can be introduced into any one or more among ClC2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7 and C8. c It has an aromatic benzene ring at both sides of its structure. The somiconauctor characteristics of TCNAQ compounds are derived from its tetracyanoquinodimethane structure a . The other features b and c each provides basis for the versatility and functionality of the derivatives as organic compounds, and are the features which differ entiate TCNAQ compounds from TCNQ and TCNNQ compounds. Pa . ticularly, the tetracyanoanthraquinodimethane skeleton has a large expanse of electron cloud and due to the synergistic action of the tetracyanoquinodimethane nucleus and the benzene rings fused thereto at both sides, the energy breadth between the ground and excited states of electrons is so small that some useful results such as increased electrical conductivity are obtained. These features make TCNAQ compounds industrially useful organic compounds or organic semiconductors. Moreover, by varying the kinds and positions of substituents, varieties can be imparted to the above features. Taking their electrical characteristics as examples, the conductivity values of TCNAQ compounds A according to this invention lie in the range of about l lie in the range of about 10 9 to 10 7 1.cm 1. Moreover, when, of the above mentioned substituent groups, a chlorine atom, a hydroxy group or an amino group exists on C1 of TCNAQ, there occurs a resonance mesomeric effect which extends the conjugated system of electrons on the tetracyanoanthraquinodimethane skeleton so that some useful results such as a remarkable increase of electrical conductivity are obtained. The above mentioned resonance effect is schematically illustrated below.EMI6.1 1 Application and Uses The TCNAQ compounds described above can be used in a variety of applications. Moreover, these compounds are useful as intermediates for the production of other valuable compounds or substances. Furthermore, these compounds or substances may be incorporated or dispersed in other inorganic compounds, organic compounds or high polymer compounds to provide compositions having desirable properties and characteristics. These compounds, substances and compositions generally can be used in a large variety of applications as organo electronic materials. Desirable results can be obtained by using the compounds of this invention selectively in accordance with the intended use or application. Some of such applications and uses will be described briefly.1.1 Polymers Starting from TCNAQ compounds, various polymers having useful properties can be produced. The term polymer as used herein means a compound formed as a plurality of tetracyanoanthraquinodimethane skeletons are linked up either directly or through the intermediary of some other group or groups. The ter group is used herein to mean an atom or a group of atoms. By way of illustration, a polyether compound can be synthesized by.condensing a TCNAQ derivative A having at least two hydroxyalkyl. groups as substituentS Polyester compounds can also be synthesized by reacting a TCNAQ derivatives A having at least 2 hydroxyalkyl groups as substituents with a TCNAQ derivative A having at least 2 carboxyorcarboxyalkyl groups as substituents. Moreover, a halogenated derivative A can be dehalogenated byUllmann reaction to obtain a polymer formed as a plurality of tetracyanoanthraquinodimethane skeletons are linked together.1.2 Charge transfer complexes A TCNAQ derivative A or a polymer derived therefrom may be doped with a compound capable of acting as an electron donor or acceptor for it to obtain a charge transfer complex. Such electron transfer complexes have desirable characteristics and, therefore, are of great industrial value. The above mentioned TCNAQ compounds or polymers derived therefrom or charge transfer complexes based thereon may be dispersed or otherwise incorporated in other high molecular compounds or the like to provide compositions having very desirable properties. As preferred samples of said electron donor, there may be mentioned such metal elements as sodium, copper, etc., aromatic compounds, e.g. anthracene, etc., amines c and phthalocyanines. As for said electron acceptor, Lexis acids such as arsenic pentafluoride, etc. are especially desirable. As matrices in which the compounds and derivatives according to this invention are incorporated or dispersed, various resins and other high molecular compounds are especially useful. In such applications, it is preferable to employ a compound A having substituents compatible with the high molecular matrix compound, for such a combination ensures a uniform composition or dispersion.For example, when a polyolefin compound is selected as said high molecular compound, an alkylated derivative A can be used with great advantage. When an aromatic high molecular compound is selected as the matrix material, it is advantageous to use a phenylated or alkyphenylated derivative A . These TCNAQ compounds and polymers and the charge transfer complexes derived therefrom, as well as compositions containing such compounds, polymers or complexes can be used in a large variety of applications as organoelectronic materials. For example, they can be used as dielectric materials, conductors, resistors, thermisters and other semiconductors, photovoltaic materials, and so on. The method of producing TCNAQ compounds in accordance with this invention will hereinafter be described briefly, reference being made to TCNQ and TCNNQ compounds for comparison s sake. Thus, the methods of producing TCNQ compounds have been described in the literature such asD. S. Acker et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 84, 3370 1962 , R. C. Wheland et al, J. Org. Chem. 40 21 , 3101 1975 and U.S. Patent 3,115,506, for instance. By way of exampleTCNQ is produced from a diethyl succinate by converting the starting compound to 1,4 cyclohexanedione and reacting the latter with malonitrile. The process for synthesis of 1,4 cyclohexanedione from diethyl succinate has been described in J. R. Vincent et al, J. Org.Chem., 3, 603 1939 and the subsequent process has been described in the above mentioned paper of D. S. Acker et al. In the former process by which 1,4 cyclohexanedioe is synthesized from diethyl succinosuccinate, the hydrolysis and decarboxylation react Ion of diethyl succinosuccinate require the very rigorous conditions of 195 to 2000C. For this reason, the production of TCNQ by the above series of reactions ha had to face a considerable difficulty. The literature of Wheland et al teaches 2 method of producing TCNQ compounds. In accordance with the method, a benzene derivative, p xylene derivative or terephthalic acid derivative is used as a starting material to give a p xylene halide which is further subjected to a complicated series of steps to give a TCNQ compound. Moreover, the tetracyano compound produced as an intermediate in the above series of reactions is only sparingly soluble In the common solvents because of the high polarity of its 4 cyano groups and, therefore, a large amount of solvent is required in the final stage of the process leading to a TCNQ compound. Thus, the conventional methods for producing TCNQ compounds require either reactions under very severe conditions, a complicated series of reaction steps, or and use of large amounts of solvents. These requirements are unfavorable not only in terms of reaction time and yield but also from the standpoints of conservation of energy or power for conducting the reactions and the consumption of solvents, for instance. The method of producing TCNAQ compounds according to this invention are free from the above mentioned disadva tages of these methods known for the productlonofTCNQ compounds and are of great industrial value. The production method according to this invention will be illustrated by way of chemical reaction formula Formula C . In Formula C, the substituents W, X, Y and Z are selected from among the substituents Zl throughZ8 in Formula A . EMI12.1 In the above series of reactions, the Diels Lide reaction a must be conducted under heating at 70 to 80 C but the other reactions proceed satisfactorily under very mild heating or at room temperature, or oven at reduced temperature. This means that the method. requires only a very low level of energy or power. Itlo.eover, except for the reaction b for the introduction of dicyanomethylene groups, all other reactions are simple audition or elimination reactions, and substantially no side reactions occur in any stage of the process. Furthermore, because the method consists of as few as three reaction steps, the desired TCNAQ compound can be obtained in high yield. In addition, the l,4,4a,5 8,8a,9a, 0a octahy ro 11,11,12,12 tetracyano 9,10 anthraquinodimethane derive tive produced in the step b is readily soluble in solvents because the high polarity of cyano groups has been mitigated by the two cyclic substituents condensed to the carbon atoms in 4a,9a and 8a,l0a positions. It is for this reason that a large amount of TCNAQ compound can be produced with use of a small amount of solvent in step c . Furthermore, p benzoquinone and butadine.or its derivative, which are starting materials, are available in quantities and at low cost and this factor also contributes to the economic advantage of this invention. The following production examples are further illus trative of this invention. The TCNAQ compounds A were produced in the following manner. i Synthesis of 1,X,4a,5,8,8a,9a,10a octahydro 9,iO anthraquinone derivatives 1,4,4a,5,8,8a,9a,10a octahydro 9,10 anthraquinone compounds were produced from 0.5 mole of p benzoquinone and 1.2 moles of butadiene or its derivatives. The butadiene derivatives employed were 2 methylbutadiene, 2,3 dimethylbutadiene, 2 ethylbutadiene, 2,3 diethylbutadiene, 2 propylbutadiene, 2 butylbutadiene, 2 pentylbutadiene, 2 hexylbutadiene, 2 octylbutadiene, 2 phenylbutadiene and 2 4 methylphenyl butadiene. p Benzoquinone and one of the above mentioned butadiene derivatives were dissolved in benzene and the solution was refluxed at 700C. Though varying somewhat with different species o F butadiene derivative, the reaction yields were invariably in excess of 85 percent. ii Synthesis of TCNAQ compounds 0.2 Mole of each 1,4,4a,5,8,8a,9a,10aoctahydro9,10 anthraquinone derivative obtained in i and 0.24 mole of malonitrile were independently dissolved in 300 ml of benzene, followed by addition of 12 ml of acetic acId and 4 ml of ammonium acetate. The mixture was refluxod for 3 hours under constant stirring. The solution war3 then cooled and filtered and the crystals were recrystallized from acetonitrile to give the corresponding 1,4,4a,5,8, 8a,9a,10a octahydro 11,11,12,12 tetracyano 9,10 anthra quinodimethane derivative. Of each of these compounds, a 0.1 mole port on was taken and, together with 0.12 mole of bromine, was added to 200 ml of acetonitrile cooled to OOC. Then, In N2 gas streams, 25 ml of pyridine was added and the solution was stirred at OOC for an hour. To the reaction mixture was added cold water and the resulting crystals were recovered by filtration and recrystallized from acetonitrile. The TCNAQ compounds produced in the above manner are shown in Table 1. Though varying somewhat with different species of TCNAQ compound, the yields were invariably over 90 . The overall yields of TCNAQ compounds through the above processes i and ii were invariably over 75 .

In the above examples, when butadiene derivatives other than 2,3 dimethylbutadiene and 2,3 diethylbutadiene were used as. startIng materials, two stereoisomers were obtained for each derivative as shown in Table 1. In such cases, the reaction product was separated into the 2,6 di substituted compound and 2,7 di substituted compound by routine paper chromatography. IdentificatIon of the respective isomers was made by measurement of dipole moment, and the compound showing a dipole moment of o was identified to be the 2,6 di substituted compound. Incidentally, the method of Wheland et al may be advantageously employed to obtain derivatives A having substituents in designated positions. This is because the inconstancy of addition reaction in the Diels Alder svstem is then eliminated. Moreover, by using a monosub stituted anthracene, there can be obtained a mono substituted TCNAQ. For example, TCNAQ mono substituted by an alkyl, amino or other group can be obtained in this manner. By the above procedure, it is easy to introduce r.substituent onto one or more amon C1, C3, C5 andC8. For example, DOCAQ and ACAQ, whose con ductivity temperature characteristics are shown in Fig.2, were produced in this manner.
