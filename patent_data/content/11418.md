# Manufacture of electroluminescent display devices.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of a monolithic LED array, in which portions of the array are electrically isolated from one another by channels 5 cut or etched through the slice of n type material 1 , the channels are filled with a glass frit which is bonded to the semiconductor material on each side of the channel, to give a robust construction. A suspension of glass particles in a liquid medium is introduced into the channels, then the liquid is removed and the glass powder is sintered the channels may be of uniform width, or may consist of a wide portion 10 , formed first from the back of the slice, and a narrower, shallow portion 11 formed subsequently from the front of the slice to meet the wide portion, to give high resolu tion. The glass suspension may be introduced into the chan nels by spreading or spinning over the slice surface, or by electrophoretic deposition and or capillary action.
