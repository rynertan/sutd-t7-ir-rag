# METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY

## Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies to human antigens present on a majority of human cells are described. These mAbs have use in a method for isolating mAB for less expressive antigens, such as cancer antigens, or other antigens associated with particu lar annormalities, disorders or disease state. The latter mAbs may be weaker and or not present to such an extent as the first mentioned mAbs. For example, these less expressive mAbs would be useful for cancer diagnosis, especially in the early stages, and for cancer treatment as well where the can cer cell is the target cell for the mAb. The mAb can be tagged with a tissue destructive agent such as a radio label, a toxin, a chemical poison, and the like. Some of the mAbs described, subset tumors of particular types and so are useful for tumor subclassification. The mAbs described are also useful in anal yzing the properties and functions of their respective antigens in human cells.
