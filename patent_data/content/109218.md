# Parallel path Coriolis mass flow rate meter.

## Abstract
A flow meter apparatus for measuring the mass flow rates of fluids passed through two essentially parallel, cantilever mounted U shaped flow tubes where, instead of the fluid serially passing through one of the U shaped flow tubes and then through the second U shaped flow tube, the fluid is essentially evenly divided and half of the fluid is passed through one U shaped flow tube and the other half of the fluid is passed through the other U shaped flow tube. The two U shaped flow tubes are sinusoidally driven as the tines of a tuning fork, and when a fluid is passed through the oscillating U shaped flow tubes Coriolis forces are generated which torsionally deflect the U shaped flow tubes. Such torsional defections are a function of the mass flow rate of the fluid passing through the two U shaped flow tubes.
