# A food product having a high fibre content and a process for producing the food product.

## Abstract
A high dietary fiber containing snack food product and process for making the same is disclosed. The product comprises from about 5 to about 30 by weight of dietary fiber, soaked in a food grade oil, for example, admixed with peanut butter such that the peanut oil becomes absorbed by the fiber, and further mixed with a compound coating. The compound coating serves as a binder and processing aid for extrusion of the mixture into shapes for immediate consumption. No baking, cooking, toasting or the like is necessary.
