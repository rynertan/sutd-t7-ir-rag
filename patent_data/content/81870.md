## Description
A composition for selective control of weeds and method for controlling weeds in a crop areaThe present invention relates to weed control by means of herbicides and more particularly to compositions and methods for selectively controlling weeds in crop areas such as wheat or potato fields, fruit plantations and other croplands where a broad spectrum of weeds must be controlled.Weed control for agricultural purposes remains a topic of great importance even though many different classes of compounds as well as thousands of specific compounds have been disclosed in the literature for the purposes of both general and selective weed control.However, spontaneous growth of undesired plants or weeds in a crop area that should be maintained free of such weeds for optimum crop yield is an extremely complex phenomenon dependent upon various static and dynamic factors including type of soil, climate, floral area, adventive plant ingressions, etc., and no generally applicable or universal solution of the pro blems involved in recurring or spontaneous growth of weeds by agrochemical means is expected in the near future.Other unsolved problems in this area include widely differing sensitivities of crop plants against herbicidal chemicals as well as the fact that repression of one weed species may cause increased growth of another competing weed species, and that some weeds tend to become resistant against previously effective herbicides.Thus, there is a continued need for novel and improved agents for selective control of weeds while, at the same time, introduction of completely new chemicals causes problems because of the need of long term testing for such properties as general environmental effects, residue, chronic toxicity, teratogenicity, etc. The use of specific combinations of known and well tested substances would reduce these problems if the ingredients of the combination complement each other as is the case, typically, for combinations of herbicidal substances with surfactants or the like adjuvants.The results of combining different herbicidal chemicals generally called active ingredients are not, as a rule, predictable. In theory, suitably complemental ingredients might yield mixtures wherein the properties of the mixture should be predictable from the properties of the ingredients. In practice, however, any mixture of two or more herbicidal active ingredients entails the risk of an unexpected reinforcement of negative properties, e.g. damage to crop plants, and even a merely additive, i.e. favorably complemental mixture of active ingredients is considered a lucky mixture in the art and is not predictable. The most desirable aim is, of course, a combination having properties that are more advantageous than the sum of the properties of the active ingredients, i.e. a better than additive or so called synergetic or synergistic combination.Specifically, a continued need exists for improved herbicide control in croplands where a broad spectrum of different types of weeds tends to florish, e.g. including dicotylodonetype or broad leaf weeds as well as monocotylodone type grass weeds comprising both annual and perennial types.Thus, a wide spectrum of herbicidal activities must be combined with avoidance of damage to crop plants and a satisfactory permanence of weed control should be combined with absence of detrimental effects upon the soil, the herbicideapplying personnel and consumers of the crops.Accordingly, it is a primary object of the invention to provide for a new and synergetic combination of substances known for weed control per se.Another object is an improved composition for use in broadspectrum control of weeds. A further object is an improved method of controlling a broad spectrum of weed types and species in a crop area.Further objects will become apparent as this specification proceeds.The above objects and further advantages are achieved, in accordance with the present invention, by combining at least one s triazine of the formula EMI4.1 wherein X is a halogen atom i.e. F, C1, Br, I and R1, R2 3 and R are independently selected from C1 C2 alkyls, i.e. methyl and ethyl, as a first active ingredient, with at least one uracil of the formulaEMI4.2 wherein R5 is hydrogen, methyl, fluoro, chloro or bromo, R6 is a C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl, and n is an integer of 1 or 2, as a second active ingredient.The s triazines of the formula 1 are known per se as well as for use as herbicides, cf. British Patent SpecificationNo. 1,132,306.Bromo and chloro as X are preferred the compound of formula 1 wherein RÚ is ethyl, Rê and R are each methyl and X is chloro is available commercially, e.g. from Shell Company, and, hence, preferred because of its availability and the fact that it has been used and tested for more than a decade. While the formula 1 s triazines also referred to as compounds 1 hereinbelow are effective against a number of grass type or monocotylodone weeds as well as several broadleaf or dicotylodone type weeds, their width of effectiveness has a number of gaps , e.g. with the hard to kill broadleaved weeds, such as Veronica persica, and with many grass weeds, such as Echinochloa crus galli and foa annua.A further limitation of the formula 1 herbicides is that their activity is closely dependent upon the type of soil.An increasing content of clay or of organic matter in the soil requires substantially increased dosage rates for sufficient weed control when the organics content of the soil increases above about 10 , by weight, of organic matter, results of weed control with the formula 1 triazines will become unpredictable.According to the invention the above shortcomings of the formula 1 triazines will be reduced or eliminated when used in combination with the formula 2 uracils for weed control.Again, formula 2 uracils also referred to herein as compounds 2 have been known per se for at least a decade, and suggested for use as herbicides cf. Swiss Patents Nos.544,493 and 544,769.It is to be noted that the term uracil has been accepted in the art as the short common name for 2,4 1H,3H pyrimidinedione, and the term uracils is used to refer to various uracil derivatives. Specific uracils are available commercially the 5 chloro 6 methyl 3 tetrahydropyran 2 yl uracil, for example, is obtainable from Roussel Uclaf, France. Specific examples of formula 2 uracils are the compounds according to the following Table I. TABLE I Examples of Compounds of the Formula 2 Compound Significance of No. n R5 R6 2 1 2 CH3 CH3 2 2 1 Cl CH3 2 3 2 H CH3 2 4 2 Cl CH3 2 5 2 Br CH3 2 6 1 Br CH3 2 7 1 Cl CH3 2 8 2 H phenyl 2 9 2 Cl penyl 2 10 2 Br phenylPreferred compounds are those wherein R5 is a halogen atom F, Cl, Br , chlorine or bromine being particularly preferred and chlorine being most preferred pyranyl compounds n in formula 2 is 2 are generally preferred over the furanyl compounds n in formula 2 is 1 compounds 2 4 and 2 5 are particularly preferred. R6 , in formula 2 , may represent any C1 C4 alkyl, i.e ethyl, propyl and butyl in addition to methyl and both straight or branched chain C2 C4 alkyls may be used as R6 instead of methyl or phenyl.The formula 2 compounds are known to have but a limited scope of weed control effectiveness. Ltl yerieraL, a combination according to the invention contains the active ingredients of formula 1 and formula 2 in a ratio of from about 10 1 to about 1 2, i.e. in the range of 10 to 0.5. Preferably, the synergetic combination of a formula 1 compound and a formula 2 compound also referred to as combination 1 2 hereinbelow contains about 2 t about 5 parts and re f rahly about 3 to 4 parts, by weight, of the formula 1 compound per each part, by weight, of the formula 2 compound. In other words, the preferred compound ratio 1 2 is between about 2 1 and about 5 1.When the weight ratio 1 2 is above 10 there will be less or no syneryism of the ingredients and the effects of the combination will be similar to those of the formula 1 compound, i.e. have insufficient effectiveness over a broad spectrum of weeds and suffer from the above described defects.On the other hand, i.e. with a 1 2 weight ratio of below 0.5 the effects of the combination tend to approach those of compound 2 if used without 1 and suffer from the above mentioned shortcomings, and there will be less or no synergism.Within the preferred range 1 2 of from about 2 to about 5 a preferred specific weight ratio is 3.5 parts, by weight, of compound 1 per each part, by weight, of compound 2 .Generally, the inventive combination 1 2 will be effective for weed control in amounts or dosage rates in the range of from about 0.5 to about 4 kg active ingredients weight total of 1 and 2 per hectare of crop area depending somewhat upon the crop plants involved. For example, an optimum dosage for using the inventive combination 1 2 on cereal type crop plants including wheat, barley, rye and oats will be in the range of from about 0.75 to 1 kg of the combined active ingredients 1 2 per hectare kg ha of cereal crop area for maize, an optimum dosage will be in the range of from about 1.5 to 2 kg ha, and for potatoes an optimum dosage will be in the range of from about 3 to 3.5 kg ha.When using dosage rates generally below 0.5 kg ha or, for the specific crop plants mentioned, below the lower range end, weed control will tend to become insufficient while dosage rates of above about 5 kg ha may tend to cause crop damage.It should be emphasized that with the specific crop plants mentioned above crop plant damages are safely prevented as long as the upper limits of the dosage ranges are not transgressed by more than about 0.5 kg ha. In general, crop plant damage will not commence as long as the upper limit of the dosage range given above for a specific crop is transgressed by not more than about 1.5 kg ha.The above mentioned dosage ranges are given for illustration only and do not preclude use of the synergetic combination for other types of crop plants such as vegetable or fruit plantations, vineyards, etc.The inventive combination 1 2 is suitable both for preemergence as well as post emergence weed control.It should be noted that while the invention requires use of the combination 1 2 , it does not preclude using addi tional substances together with the formula 1 and 2 compounds. Such additional substances may be inactive such as extenders or diluents, functional such as adjuvants including surfactants used for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining a given composition in a desirable or required state, as well as thickeners, defoaming agents, anti freeze agents, coloring materials,or active substances such as fungizides, insectizides, mineral oils, surfactants that improve adhesion to plants, fertilizers and other substances for plant growth control as long as they do not interfere with the synergetic properties of the inventive combination. Again, such further constituents are known in the agrochemical art.Both active ingredients 1 and 2 of the subject combination are normally solid and can be applied onto a crop area in solid form, e.g. as a pulverulent or granular preparation generally in mixture with a solid extender or diluent. Alternatively, the ingredients can be dispersed or dissolved in a liquid extender or diluent. Further, both ingredients 1 and 2 can be used herein in commercially available grades and in conventional particle sizes for herbicide use of typically below 30 um, notably 10 um or smaller.Many preferred formulations will, in general, contain one or more surfactants, e.g. alcanol amines of fatty acids, polyglycol ethers and the like numerous examples will be found in standard reference books, e.g. McCutcheon s Detergent and Emulsifier Annual or Encyclopedia of Surface ActiveAgents by Sisley and Wood. Specific examples are Atlox 4853 B obtainable from Atlas Chemical Industries N,V. and Nekal obtainable from BASF AG. Suitable solid or liquid extenders are known in the art and include finely divided solids such as talcs, clays, kieselgur, nut shell flower as well as aqueous and non aqueous liquids including organic solvents, mineral oils and the like.Generally speaking, a composition formulated for use in the invention may contain from about 1 to about 99 , by weight, of the combination 1 2 depending upon the type of application as well as the applicator apparatus used. As representative examples, tank applicators and tank mixture formulation or dusting equipment and dust mixture formulation can be mentioned. Tank mixtures can be made from relatively concentrated compositions and mixed with water prior to application as is conventional in the herbicide artFor example, a wettable powder formulation may contain up to 50 or 60 , by weight, of active ingredient 1 2 while a granulate may include as little as 3 to 10 , by weight, of the active ingredients. Other types of formulations suitable for use herein include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols,dusts, pastes and granulates. Wettable powders and aqueous emulsions are preferred for many types of application while emulsion type or suspension type concentrates are preferred formulations for in situ dilution, generally with water.Inventive compositions containing the synergetic combination 1 2 in a formulation for use or storage can be obtained by conventional blending, mixing or emulsifying methods from the above constituents, including milling in hammer mills, high shear mixers, fluid mills and the like. The invention will now be explained in more detail in the following examples that illustrate, but are not intended to limit, the invention. Parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.Greenhouse and field tests were generally made according to standard herbicide test procedures as recommended by the European Weed Research Council EWRC . Field tests were made at various trial sites in Switzerland and replicated trials were made at each site each site contained a plurality of defined 2 plots of at least about 10 m each. There was at least one untreated plot per site as control and one or more plots for comparative purposes.Weed control effectiveness fpr defined weed species was determined by visual observation and scored according to theEWRC scale that ranges from 1 to 9 and in which 9 indicates no damage of weed , i.e. a weed control effectiveness of Zero Percent, while 1 indicates total killing of the weeds concerned, i.e. a weed control effectiveness of 100 .The compositions were applied in various dosages in the form of aqueous sprays prepared from a wettable powder at a substantially uniform spray rate of about 1000 Liters per hectare with a log sprayer or a field plot sprayer Van derWeij using a pressure of 3 bar. The dosage was varied either by varying the concentration of the wettable powder in the aqueous spray used in the field plot sprayer or by means of the log sprayer as described in our U.S. Patent No. 4t211f551. EXAMPLE 1 1 Preparation of Formulations for Testing Wettable powder formulations were prepared from mixtures of 50 of the active ingredient or the combination of active ingredients to be tested and 50 of a blend consisting of 33 parts of white bolus powder white bole or kaolin , 10 parts of commercial lignin sulfonate, 5 parts of finely div ided silica and 2 parts of the commercial alkylaryl sulfonate surfactant sold under the name NEKAL reg. trademark . The constituents were blended, coarsely milled and passed through a fluid mill to produce particles of active ingredi ents that are all below about 30 microns in diameter. The pro duct was reblended before packaging. For use of this compos ition in selective weed control, the composition was suspend ed in a desired amount of water and applied to the area that was to be treated typically in an amount of about 1 to about 8 kilograms of the composition per hectare of the area. Generally, such a wettable powder is suitable for dispersion in water at a proportion of 20 to 600 parts of water per part of the composition to provide aqueous compositions that can be applied at a spray rate of between 500 and 1500 Liters per hectare. 2 Active Ingredient s Compositions in the form of wettable powders were made as set forth above using the following active ingredients individually or in combinations as specified below as the 50 por tion of the formulation Compound 1 2 chloro 4 1 cyano 1 methyl ethylamino 6 ethylamino 1,3,5triazine, i.e. the formula 1 compound having the structureEMI13.1 Compound 2 5 chloro 6 methyl 3 tetrahydropyran 2 yl uracil, i.e. the formula 2 compound having the structureEMI13.2 Combinations 1 2 Mixtures of the specific formula 1 compound and the specific formula 2 compound both commercial grade were made in various ratios 1 2 ranging between 1 2 and 20 1 specifically 0.55 1.1 2.2 4.46 8,93 and 17.86 .Prior Art Commercially available herbicides as specified below were used to prepare comparative formulations. EXAMPLE 2Greenhouse tests were made to determine the activity of the compounds of formula 1 and 2 when used singly and in combination on various weeds. Test pots were seeded with the weed in question and cultured at temperatures of 20 to 210C.Weed types tested included both dicotylodones and monocotylodones Alopecurus myosuroides, Echinochloa crus galli, Sinapis alba, Galium aparine . The seeded pots were sprayed with the aqueous dispersion of the wettable powder prepared as explained in Example 1 and at the dosage rates indicated for pre emergence treatment.The weed control effect was observed 25 days after spraying and expressed in EWRC units. The average control effectiveness ACE was calculated. The results are summarized in the following Table II.

Crop plant damage in terms of phytotoxis is judged four to five weeks after spraying by means of the inverse rating derived from EWRC units a phytotoxicity of 1 indicates no crop damage Zero percent damage effects while a phytotoxicity of 9 indicates total 100 t crop damage.The results average of eight trial plots are summarized inTable V showing that the inventive combination provides for a weed control effectiveness that is at least as good as that obtained with the prior art compositions but is obtained at dosage rates that are only a third or less than those required according to the art. Such results were obtained according to the invention without any crop damage.

The synergetic effect includes a better than additive and, hence, unexpected weed control effectiveness as well as broad spectrum effectivity, control of hard to kill weeds such as Veronica sp., and improved selectivity. At the same time, a broad variety of crop plants including potatoes, wheat, barley, oats, maize, peas, broad beans, sugar beets or cane, berry bushes, fruit trees, grapes, etc. will not be damaged by dosage rates of the 1 2 combinations that are highly effective against typical weeds tending to appear with the crop plants mentioned.Further, it can be assumed that the variations of substitution defined herein above for the formula 1 triazines and the formula 2 uracils in the inventive combination will all show synergism of the type disclosed, notably when using the preferred subgeneric and specific compounds of the formula 1 and 2 compounds.
