# Calibrating unit for calibrating a hydraulic or electrical pressure gauge, especially of a probing device.

## Abstract
A calibrating unit for calibrating a pressure gauge includes a piston 7 which may be loaded by pressurized oil and which may be fastened at its upper end to the pressure gauge. A pressure piece 11 being movable within the piston 7 can be loaded at its upper side by a measuring member 3 of the pressure gauge and can transmit this load at its lower side to a spring system 15, 16, 17 resting on the housing 6 of the unit. The movement of the pressure piece 11 is deter mined by a measuring instrument such as a measuring watch 21 . The deflection of the pointer of this watch is a calibrating measure for the pressure gauge.
