# An optical connector for aligning collinearly the axes of a pair of optical waveguides utilising a three rod splice alignment technique.

## Abstract
Figure 5A illustrates a connector for aligning colinearly the axes of a pair of opposed optical waveguides 32, 34 the connector comprising at least three bodies 2 carrying alignment surfaces facing radially inwards of the axes of the waveguides 32, 34 and providing therebetween an intersti tial passageway 44 having a central portion and open ends through which the waveguides 32, 34 enter, characterised in that the midportions 8 of the alignment surfaces are adapted for deflection radially inward and the interstitial passageway 44 assumes a tapered reduction from each of the open ends toward the central portion, and the wave guides 32, 34 enter the open ends of the passageway 44 and are funnelled by the respective tapered reductions, and means 20, 26 are provided for deflecting the alignment surfaces into clamped engagement on the waveguides.
