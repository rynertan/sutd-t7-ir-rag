# INTEGRATED MICROCONDUITS FOR CONTINUOUS FLOW ANALYSIS

## Abstract
A miniaturized system of conduits formed in integrated, monolithic structure includes a first plate 4 of rigid, nonpo rous material on one face of which is formed one or more chan nels 8 , and a second plate 12 bonded to the one face of the first plate to cover the channel. Ducts 18 are formed in either the first or second plate to extend perpendicularly from the channel to the exterior of the plates to allow introduction of so lution into and withdrawal of solution from the channel. Addi tional plates, with channels formed in the faces thereof, may be bonded to the first and second plates in a stacked relation ship to provide multiple levels of channels, selectively con nected by perpendicular ducts.
