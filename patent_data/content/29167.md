# Semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device has on a predetermined semiconductor substrate 11 a stacked region for optical confinement including an active layer 13 and clad layers 12, 14 , a first electrode 120 disposed on the semicon ductor substrate side and a second electrode 15 disposed over the stacked region, and a means for constructing an optical resonator. The means to inject current into the active layer 13 is formed of a plurality of stripe conductive regions 116 ... 119 which are juxtaposed in a travelling direction of a laser beam, and laser radiations emitted in correspondence with the respective stripe conductive re gions 116 ... 119 form a simply connected net and give rise to nonlinear interactions among them. As a typical example of the current injection means, the conductive regions 16 ... 119 have a strip shaped pattern which in cludes a broader portion 116A, 117A and a narrower portion 116B . A coupled multiple stripe laser device in which the phases and wavelengths of the laser radiations of the respective strips are uniform is realized.
