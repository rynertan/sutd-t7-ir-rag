# Displays and subassemblies having optimized capacitance.

## Abstract
Light influencing subassemblies and displays each hav ing a structure in which all of the addressed pixel electronic circuitry, including an optimized capacitance and including isolation devices, where utilized, are located at one electrode side of each pixel electode combination 30, 52, 62, 72 . The structure includes the subdivision of one pixel electrode 34 into at least two spaced apart side by side electrode seg ments 38, 40 opposite a common electrode 32 . The displays include light influencing material 36 aisposed between the segmented and common electrodes which form a first capacitance. A second capacitance is formed electrical ly in parallel with the first capacitance. The second capaci tance can include an additional capacitance electrode 48 formed separated from the segmented electrode by an insulating layer 50 . The electrode segments further can include at least one isolation device 54, 56 64, 74, 76 coupled to at least one of the segments 38, 40 which facilitates selective excitation of the pixel elements and applied potential reversal across the electrodes during alternate display frames. The displays have an increased manufacturing yield, optimized capacitance and increased isolation.
