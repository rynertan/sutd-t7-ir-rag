## Description
This invention relates to detergent compositions that clean well and at the same time have a softening effect on textiles and fabrics. Detergent compositions for simultaneously cleaning and softening fabrics are known in the art and various proposals have been made to formulate such detergent compositions. Since the most commonly known commercially available organic textile softening agents are cationic materials, numerous proposals have been made to incorporate a cationic fabric softener in a normally anionic surfactant based detergent composition. However, the interference inhibition from anionic and cationic surface active agents is known to constitute a major obstacle to the realisation of the simultaneous use of cationic and anionic surface active agents. The reason for this interference or inhibition is that cationic materials are reactive towards the anionic surfactants present in conventional laundry detergents. If both types of oppositely charged materials are formulated in a single product, they tend to interact on addition to a wash liquor, forming insoluble inactive complexes. Obviously, much effort has been made in trying to overcome this problem, e.g. by the addition of compatibilising or solubilising compounds as described for example in U.S. patents 3,886,075 and 3,954,632, and French Patent 2,236,925, none of which has resulted in a fully satisfactory product. An alternative approach has been to incorporate one of the reactant materials in a form that inhibits its contact with the other in the wash liquor, and examples of formulations of this type are taught in U.S. Patents 3,936,537 and 3,644,203. The performance of these compositions is, however, sensitive to the washing conditions that are employed. In an attempt to avoid the reactivity problems altogether, nonionic surfactants have been proposed in place of the conventional anionic surfactants, and compositions of this type are described in e.g. British Patent Specification 1,079,388 and U.S. Patent 3,607,763. However, it has been found that levels of nonionic surfactant sufficient to provide good cleaning impair the softening of the cationic softener. Later proposals to provide a fabric softening effect in laundry detergent compositions have been directed to the use of alternative fabric softening materials which are non cationic in nature, e.g. certain long chain water insoluble tertiary amines that are nonionic in character at the wash liquor pH existing when a conventional laundry detergent is used, as described in British Patent 1,514,216 and European Patent Applications 0011340 and 0026528. However, these alternative fabric softening materials are in themselves less effective than the conventional fabric softening compounds. A further proposal has been to use cellulolytic enzymes, i.e. cellulase, as a harshness reducing agent, as disclosed in GB A 2,075,028, GB A 2,095,275 and GB A 2,094,826. DE 33 39 050 Colgate Palmolive relates to particulate detergent softener combinations, intended to provide improved softness, cleanliness and antistatic properties to textiles. The compositions are based on non soap organic surfactants, builder, from 2 20 mixtures of cationic amine softener and nonionic substances, plus 0 20 fatty acid soap or a mixture of such soap with nonionic surfactant, with the cationic and nonionic substances present mixed together in distinct particles which are dispersed essentially homogeneously through the composition. DE 32 07 847 Kao Soap Co describes laundry detergents based on anionic or nonionic or ampholytic detergent and a bacterial or fungal cellulase e.g. at an activity of at least 100 cotton units per kg, defined in the specification . The advantage mentioned in this specification is an outstanding washing effect for dirt which seems to have nothing to do with the enzyme activity of the cellulase . p.4 lines 26 28 . Later on it is speculated that the effect has to do with effects of cellulase on the surfaces of cotton fibres, and a covering of such surfaces with surfactants. Cellulase has a disadvantage in that it only exerts a softening effect on cellulosic fibres. Furthermore, if used on its own, cellulase requires a relatively high level of incorporation for effective single wash softening performance. Still, it is beyond any doubt that cationic compounds are the most effective of all fabric softening agents known so far. It is an object of the present invention to increase the effectiveness of active ingredients intended to provide accessory benefits in laundry detergent compositions, and provide a textile softening detergent composition containing a cationic fabric softening compound having improved cleaning and softening effects on a wider range of natural and synthetic fibres, e.g. cotton, cotton polyester mixtures, wool and synthetics such as acrylic. It has now surprisingly been found that the above object can be achieved if the cationic fabric softening compound is used in conjunction with a fungal cellulase as the essential fabric softening ingredients. According to the invention there is provided an improved alkaline detergent composition for the cleaning and softening of fabrics comprising Preferably compound a is an anionic surfactant or a mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants. Component b is preferably a di tallowyl dimethyl ammonium halide, and component d is preferably an alkali cellulase having alkaline pH at its pH optimum. In its broadest aspect the invention comprises three components, namely the anionic and or nonionic surfactant component a , the cationic fabric softening compound b , and the cellulase component d . A wide range of anionic surfactants can be used in the compositions of the present invention.

Suitable paraffin sulphonates are essentially linear and contain from 8 to 24 carbon atoms, more especially from 14 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable alpha olefin sulphonates can have 10 to 24 carbon atoms, more especially 14 to 16 carbon atoms alpha olefin sulphonates can be made by reaction with sulphur trioxide, followed by neutralisation under conditions such that any sultones present are hydrolyzed to the corresponding hydroxy alkane sulphonates. Suitable alpha sulphocarboxylates can contain from 6 to 20 carbon atoms included herein are not only the salts of alpha sulphonated fatty acids, but also their esters made from alcohols containing 1 to 14 carbon atoms. Suitable alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates can be ethers of alcohols having 10 to 18 carbon atoms, more especially those derived from coconut oil and tallow. Suitable alkyl phenol polyethoxy ether sulphates can have 8 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and an average of 1 to 6 CH₂CH₂O groups per molecule. Suitable 2 acyloxy alkane 1 sulphonates can contain from 2 to 9 carbon atoms in the acyl group and 9 to 23 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety. Suitable beta alkyloxy alkane sulphonates can contain 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkane moiety. The alkyl chains of the foregoing non soap anionic surfactants can be derived from natural sources such as coconut oil or tallow, or can be made synthetically as for example by using the Ziegler or Oxo processes. Water solubility can be achieved by using alkali metal, ammonium or alkanol ammonium cations sodium is preferred. Mixtures of anionic surfactants are contemplated by this invention a satisfactory mixture contains for example alkyl benzene sulphonate having 11 13 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and alkyl sulphate having 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Suitable soaps can contain 8 to 18 carbon atoms, more especially 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Soaps can be made by direct saponification or natural fats and oils such as coconut oil, tallow and palm oil, or by the neutralization of free fatty acids obtained from either natural or synthetic sources. The soap cation can be alkali metal, ammonium or alkanol ammonium sodium is preferred. The compositions may contain from 0 to 50 of anionic detergent, preferably from 4 to 30 and normally from 5 to 15 of anionic detergent. Nonionic surfactants may be incorporated in amounts of up to 100 by weight of the total surfactant, but normally are present in amounts of less than 75 . By total surfactant is meant the sum of the anionic surfactant and nonionic surfactant. Suitable nonionics are water soluble ethoxylated materials of HLB 11.5 17.0 and include but are not limited to C₁₀ C₂₀ primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates and C₆ C₁₀ alkylphenol ethoxylates. C₁₄ C₁₈ linear primary alcohols condensed with from seven to thirty moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol are preferred, examples being C₁₄ C₁₅ EO ₇, C₁₆ C₁₈ EO ₂₅ and especially C₁₆ C₁₈ EO ₁₁. Among suitable cationic softeners are the conventional substantially water insoluble quaternary ammonium compounds, and C₁₀ ₂₅ alkyl imidazolinium salts. Well known species of substantially water insoluble quaternary ammonium compounds have the formula wherein R₁ and R₂ represent hydrocarbyl groups of from 10 to 22 carbon atoms R₃ and R₄ represent hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, X is any anion such as halide, a C₂ C₂₂ carboxylate, or an alkyl or arylsulph on ate. Examples of preferred anions include bromide, chloride, methyl sulphate, toluene , xylene , cumene and benzene sulphonate, benzoate, p hydroxybenzoate, acetate and propionate. Preferred quaternary ammonium softeners are the di C₁₆ C₂₀ alkyl di C₁ C₄ alkyl ammonium salts such as ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride ditallow dimethyl ammonium methyl sulphate dihexadecyl dimethy ammonium chloride di hydrogenated tallow dimethyl ammonium chloride dioctadecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dieicosyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dieocosyl ammonium chloride di hydrogenated tallow dimethyl ammonium methyl sulphate dihexadecyl diethyl ammonium chloride di coconut alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. Ditallow dimethyl ammonium chloride, di hydrogenated tallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and di coconut alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride are preferred. Also suitable are the single long chained quaternary ammonium compounds of the above formula wherein R₁ is C₁₀ to C₂₂ alkyl or alkenyl, preferably C₁₆ to C₂₀ alkyl, and R₂, R₃ and R₄ are lower alkyl groups, that is C₁ to C₄ alkyl groups, especially methyl, or aryl groups and X is as defined above. Optionally also two or all three of R₂, R₃ and R₄ may together represent a heterocyclic ring. Some representative examples of such compounds are lauryl trimethyl ammonium bromide, lauryl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, myristyl dimethyl ethyl ammonium bromide, cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, behenyl trimethyl ammonia methosulphate, oleyl methyl diethyl ammonium chloride, cetyl stearyl or oleyl pyridinium chloride, behenyl pyridinium bromide, stearyl methyl morpholinium chloride, stearyl or oleyl ethyl or propyl morpholinium chloride.

Examples are Substances of this sort are sold commercially, for instance under the Trade Name Ethoquads . Another class of suitable cationic surfactants can be represented by C₁₀ C₂₅ alkylimidazolinium salts. Preferred salts are those conforming to the formula wherein R₆ is a C₁ C₄ alkyl radical, R₅ is hydrogen or a C₁ C₄ alkyl radical, R₈ is a C₁₀ C₂₅ alkyl radical and R₇ is hydrogen or a C₁₀ C₂₅ radical.

Also suitable is the substance sold as Dinormac Pierrefitte Auby or Duomac Armour Hess believed to have the formula It is highly desirable when one or more of R₉ in these components is hydrogen, that the pH of the formulation be such that one or more of the nitrogen atoms is protonated. Other suitable cationic softeners are described in US patent N 4,076,632 issued 28th February 1978. Some suitable commercially available substances are marketed under the following Trade Names Mixtures of two or more of these cationic softeners may be employed. Preferred cationic softeners are ditallowyl dimethyl ammonium halides or methosulphate, and imidazolinium salts, e.g. Varisoft 455 or 475. The compositions of the invention should contain from 0.5 to 15 by weight of the cationic fabric softener, preferably from 1.5 to 6 . The cellulase usable in the present invention is a fungal cellulase having a pH optimum of between 5 and 11.5. It is, however, preferred to use fungal cellulases which have optimum activity at alkaline pH values, such as those described in UK Patent Application GB 2 075 028 A UK Patent Appln GB 2 095 275 A and UK Patent Appln GB 2 094 826 A. Examples of such alkaline cellulases are cellulases produced by a strain of The cellulase added to the composition of the invention may be in the form of a non dusting granulate, e.g. marumes or prills , or in the form of a liquid in which the cellulase is provided as a cellulase concentrate suspended in e.g. a nonionic surfactant or dissolved in an aqueous medium, having cellulase activity of at least 350 regular C The amount of cellulase in the composition of the invention will, in general, be for example from 0.1 to 10 by weight in whatever form. In terms of cellulase activity the use of cellulase in an amount corresponding to from 0.25 to 150 or higher regular C The detergent compositions of the present invention may of course include, as optional ingredients, components that are usually found in laundry detergents. These include zwitterionic surfactants, detergency builder salts, bleaching agents and organic precursors therefor, suds depression agents, soil suspending and anti redeposition agents, other enzymes, e.g. proteolytic and amylolytic enzymes, optical brighteners, colouring agents and perfumes. Detergency builder salts are a preferred component c of the compositions of the invention and can be inorganic or organic in character. Non limiting examples of suitable water soluble, inorganic alkaline detergent builder salts include the alkali metal carbonates, borates, phosphates, polyphosphates, bicarbonates and silicates. Specific examples of such salts include the sodium and potassium tetraborates, bicarbonates, carbonates, triphosphates, pyrophosphates, pentapolyphosphates and nexamethaphosphates. Sulphates are usually also present. Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builder salts are Mixtures of organic and or inorganic builders can be used herein. One such mixture of builders is disclosed in Canadian Patent Specification 755 038, e.g. a ternary mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate, trisodium nitrilotriacetate and trisodium ethane 1 hydroxy 1,1 diphosphonate. Another type of detergency builder material useful in the present compositions and processes comprises a water soluble material capable of forming a water insoluble reaction product with water hardness cations preferably in combination with a crystallization seed which is capable of providing growth sites for said reaction product. Such seeded builder compositions are fully disclosed in British Patent Specification 1 424 406. Preferred water soluble builders are sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium silicate, and usually both are present. In particular, it is preferred that a substantial proportion, for instance from 3 to 15 by weight of the composition of sodium silicate solids of ratio weight ratio SiO₂ Na₂O from 1 1 to 3.5 1 be employed. A further class of detergency builder materials useful in the present invention are insoluble sodium aluminosilicates, particularly those described in Belgian Patent Specification 814,874, issued 12th November 1974. This patent specification discloses and claims detergent compositions containing sodium aluminosilicate of the formula The detergent builder salts are normally included in amounts of from 10 to 80 by weight of the composition, preferably from 20 to 70 and most usually from 30 to 60 by weight. Bleaching agents useful in the compositions of the invention include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate and other perhydrates at levels of from 5 to 35 by weight of the composition. Organic peroxy bleach precursors such as tetra acetyl ethylene diamine and tetra acetyl glycoluril can also be included and these and other precursors are disclosed in German Patent Application N 2 744 642. In compositions incorporating oxygen bleaches, bleach stabilisers are also preferred components, usually at levels of from 0.2 to 2 by weight of the composition. The stabilisers may be organic in nature, such as the previously mentioned aminopolyacetates and aminopolyphosphonates, or may be inorganic, such as magnesium silicate. In the latter case the material may be added to the formulation or formed in situ by the addition of a water soluble magnesium salt to a slurried detergent mix containing an alkali metal silicate. Suds controlling agents are often present. These include suds boosting or suds stabilising agents such as mono or diethanolamides of fatty acids. More often in modern detergent compositions, suds depressing agents are required. Soaps, especially those having 18 carbon atoms, or the corresponding fatty acids, can act as effective suds depressors if included in the anionic surfactant component of the present compositions. Usually 1 to 4 of such soap is effective as a suds suppressor. Very suitable soaps, when suds suppression is a primary reason for their use, are those derived from Hyfac Trade Name for hardened marine oil fatty acids, predominantly C₁₈ to C₂₂ acids available from the Humko Corporation . However, non soap suds suppressors are preferred in synthetic detergent based compositions of the invention, since soap or fatty acid tends to give rise to a characteristic odour in these compositions. Preferred suds suppressors comprise silicones. In particular there may be employed a particulate suds suppressor comprising silicone and silanated silica releasably enclosed in water soluble or dispersible substantially non surface active detergent impermeable carrier. Suds depressing agents of this sort are disclosed in British Patent Specification 1 407 997. A very suitable granular prilled suds depressing product comprises 7 silica silicone 15 by weight silanated silica, 85 silicone, obtained from Messrs Dow Corning , 65 sodium tripolyphosphate, 25 tallow alcohol condensed with 25 molar proportions of ethylene oxide, and 3 moisture. The amount of silica silicone suds suppressor employed depends upon the degree of suds suppression desired, but it is often in the range of from 0.01 to 0.5 by weight of the detergent composition. Other suds suppressors which may be used are water insoluble, preferably microcrystalline, waxes having a melting point in the range of from 35 to 125 C and a saponification value of less than 100, as described in British Patent Specification 1 492 938. Yet other suitable suds suppressing systems are mixtures of hydrocarbon oil, a hydrocarbon wax and hydrophobic silica as described in European Patent Application No.0000216 and, especially, particulate suds suppressing compositions comprising such mixtures, combined with an HLB in the range of from 14 to 19 and a compatibilising agent capable of forming inclusion compounds, such as urea. These particulate suds suppressing compositions are described in European Patent Application 0 00 8830. Soil suspending agents are usually present at about 0.1 to 10 , such as water soluble salts of carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxyhydroxymethyl cellulose, polyethylene glycols of molecular weight of from 400 to 10,000 and copolymers of methylvinylether and maleic anhydride or acid, available under the Trade Name Gantrez. Proteolytic or amylolytic enzymes, especially proteolytic, and optical brighteners of anionic, cationic or nonionic types, especially the derivatives of sulphonated triazinyl diamino stilbene may be present. Photoactivated bleaches such as the tri and tetra sulphonated derivatives of zinc phthalocyanine are also useful components of the present composition. Colours, non substantive, and perfumes, as required to improve the aesthetic acceptability of the product, are usually incorporated. Throughout the description herein where sodium salts have been referred to, potassium, lithium or ammonium or amine salts may be used instead if their extra cost etc. are justified for special reasons. The detergent compositions may be prepared in any way appropriate to their physical form, such as by dry mixing the components, co agglomerating them or dispersing them in a liquid carrier. However, a preferred physical form is a granule incorporating a detergency builder salt and this is most conveniently manufactured by spray drying at least part of the composition. For the purpose of the following discussion, components of the composition that are normally added to a detergent crutcher mix and spray dried are identified as a , components which are applied in the liquid form by spray on to other solid components are identified as b and components which are added as solids other than in the spray dried portion are identified as c . Conventionally, the compositions are prepared by making up an aqueous slurry of the non heat sensitive components a , comprising the anionic and or nonionic surfactants, builder and filler salts together with any soil suspending agents and optical brighteners, and spray drying this slurry. The moisture content of the slurry is normally in the range of 28 to 36 and its temperature is conveniently in the range of 70 to 90 C. The spray drying tower inlet temperatures are normally in the range of 300 to 360 C and the resultant spray dried granules have a moisture content of 8 12 by weight. An optional, but preferred, additional processing step is to cool the dried granules rapidly by means of cool air from a temperature of 90 C to a temperature in the range of 25 to 35 C, in order to facilitate the further processing of the product. Solid heat sensitive components c , such as persalts and enzymes, are mixed with the spray dried granules. Although the water insoluble cationic component may be included in the slurry for spray drying, it may degrade under certain processing conditions and adversely affect product quality. It is therefore preferred that the water insoluble cationic material be added as a dry particulate solid to the spray dried granules before or after other heat sensitive solids have been dry mixed with them. If the cationic is applied as a melt, a liquid temperature of 5 to 30 C in excess of the melting point can conveniently be used for the spray on. When the cationic is a solid of rather high melting point, it may be necessary to blend it with a compatible lower melting substance so as to ensure that granules sprayed on therewith are sufficiently crisp, are free flowing and do not cake on storage. The invention is illustrated by the following non limiting examples. A detergent powder of the following composition was prepared by spray drying where the percentages quoted are based on the weight of the final product. To this spray dried base powder was added 21 of sodium perborate tetrahydrate and 14 of sodium sulphate. This composition was used as a control. Further compositions were prepared which included a tertiary amine Armeen M2HT ex Akzo N.V. , cationic fabric softener Ditallowyl dimethyl ammonium chloride and fungal cellulase as set out below. These components were added to the spray dried base powder granules and the level of post dosed sodium sulphate in the base powder was reduced accordingly. These compositions were then used to wash pre harshened terry towelling and acrylic monitors. The product dosage was 5 g l, the water hardness was 8 German Hardness and the pH of the wash liquor was approximately 9.3. A Miele W406 TMT automatic washing machine was used on a 25 C to 40 C heat up cycle, heating up at 2 C min. The wash time was 35 minutes. After washing, the monitors were rinsed 3 times in tap water 1 5 , line dried and then assessed for softness using a laboratory softness measuring device. The results, expressed in relative harshness , were as set out in the following Table 1, the softness of the monitors washed once in the control formulation being taken as 100 . Hence, lower figures show better softening. A comparison of the results shows that the use of a cationic fabric softening compound and cellulase together of Example I gives a softening benefit which is greater than the use of each softening compound alone Examples A, B and C or the use of a combination of amine cellulase Example D . The following compositions were made up The compositions were used to wash pre harshened cotton terry towelling monitors, i.e. 30 x prewashed at 90 C in a Brandt washing machine. The washing experiments were conducted in Tergotometers at 40 C. The conditions were a 30 minute wash with 4 g l product in 24 H water at a liquor cloth ratio of 20 1. The softening effects achieved after a single wash, 3 washes and 5 washes were assessed by four independent judges using a ranking difference method and the resulting scores converted to a percentage of the rinse conditioner delivery under the same conditions higher figures showing better softening benefit . The results were as set out in the following Table 2. A comparison of the results shows that Example II, containing 4 cationic 0.8 cellulase, of the invention gives a softening benefit which is much greater than that of composition A using 4 cationic alone, of composition B using 0.8 cellulase alone, and composition C using 1.8 cellulase alone.
