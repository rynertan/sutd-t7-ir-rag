## Description
ROAD VESICLE WiTH IMPRONTED LIGHTING SYSTEM This invention relates to road vehicle lights for illumination of the road Driving by night through narrow and dark roads may be an ordeal. Headlights of vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, even when deflected as required by law in some countries, perilously restrict visibility of the very region of the road the driver needs to see i order to avoid accidents in extreme situations a blind spot in created accounting for many cyclists and pedestrians being killed and for some drivers killing themselves by crashing into unperceived obstacles. This problem has been ameliorated to some extent by having the light beam dipped and deflected to the nearside of the driver. However it will be seen that this is only a partial solution to the real problem.This concerns, at least, two vehicles and the whole solution must, therefore, consist of the parts that each of them can contribute. In fact, it is not really possible for any one driver during this passing of two vehicles to light up his own way, but it is quite easy for each of them to illwminate the way or the other. The invention accordingly provides a road vehicle having mounted thereon at least one light adapted to illuminate an area of the road surface generally laterally of the vehicle on the offside thereof. The invention has the great advantage that when two such vehicles meet on a typical two way road, at night, the vehicles use not only their usual lower beams or dipped headlights but also at least one light source capable of illuminating effectively a region of the opposite traffic lane A further advantage of the invention is that, by using these courtesy passing lights , each driver also reduces the inconvenience hisvehiclets lower beams can bring on the other driver. Yet another advantage of the invention is that the resulting elimination of the blind spot and the increase in illumination of his own lane will, for each driver, bring about an important reduction of eye fatigue caused by conditions heretofore. Some embodimenta of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatical aerial view of two road vehicles approaching each other on a road, being fitted with passing lights in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a diagrammatical front elevation of one of the vehicles in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a geometrical plan view of another such vehicle Figures 4 and 5 are schematic plan and front elevations respectively of a vehicle differently so fitted Figure 6 shows four examples of forms of passing lights, and Figures 7, 8 and 9 are exzmplary circuit diagrams for controlling passing lights Figure 1 shows approaching vehicles having passing lights which illuminate the road 30m rearwardly.The useful illuminated area for either driver will be the sum of the illuminated areas A due to the present lower beams of his own vehicle, and B due to the courtesy passing lights of the other vehicle. These courtesy passing lights mounted on the second vehicle behave as if they were lower beams of the first vehicle located in an advanced position relative to the first vehicle,EMI4.1 EMI4.2 One or more lamps can be used to illuminate effectively region B.Ideally as in Figure 3, two lower beam lamps may be provided, one of them having a symmetrical beam which is condensed within a 10 degree angle and a second one the beam of which is spread, also symmetrically, over about 100 degrees, these beams being oriented in such a way that their planes of symmetry make, respectively, with the vertical plane v symmetry of the vehicle, angles of g degrees and 60 degrees.One lamp having a lower assymmetical beam combining the two above defined beams would also be suitable. Courtesy passing lights should of course conform to lighting regulations enacted by state legislation or by international bodies such as the InternationalOrganization for Standardization regarding meeting or lower beams with due regard to the need for avoiding inconvenience to other road users.The light beams shall then be contained inside the cone of revolution about a vertical axis the vehicle resting on a horizontal plane surface , the vertex of which corresponds to the light bulb with the cone opening out through an angle Figure 2 not exceeding according to Portuguese law, 87.7 degrees for lamps loc√Öatedata height of 1.20 meters above the ground, which angular value can be increased to 88.8 degrees for lamps at 0.60 m above the ground. Requirements of other regulations are, in general, less demanding than Portuguese Ones for example, in the case of EEC countries, At can attain values of the order of 89 4 degrees according to prescriptions 6.1 and 6.2 of Annex I to the Directive du Conseil des Communauts Europenes dated the 27th July, 1976 76 761 EEC . The courtesy passing lights are preferably located on the side of the vehicle in places such as those indicated in Figure 1 and Figure 3. They can also be located at the rear corner of the vehicle nearer to the centre of the road, as in Figures 4 and 5 at locationsE and F. Their heights above ground shall conform to specific Regulations, if any, for passing lights according to PortugueseLaw .60 meters is the minimum and 1.20 meters is the maximum height above ground for such lights . A lamp having in its illuminated area a diffusing glass allowing it to be regarded from any direction without discomfort can also provide enough light to illuminate effectively a limited region of the opposite traffic lane just at the side of the vehicle, and could be installed without inconvenience for any road user at heights well above the maximum permitted height for usual passing lights Figures 4 and 5, Grand G to complement courtesy lower beam lights located as indicated above. To reduce still more the eye fatigue of drivers it may be shown appropriate to join the two classical lower beam lamps, which according to the present laws of some countries should be symmetrical in relation to the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the vehicle, placing both of them on the near side, i.e. on the farthest half of the vehicle with reference to the centre line of the road Figures 4 and 5, C and C . The lower beam nearer the centre of the road might then be replaced by a mere side or signalling light, or its luminous intensity decreased, or its maximum reach reduced to a fraction of the usual values of a classical lower beam lights Figure 4, D and D . A courtesy passing light should also, when in use, be recognised as such by any driver and so should preferably have a distinctive mark or characteristic enabling it to be distinguished from a classical lower beam light. Otherwise, a driver following behind the car that uses it may be mistaken in his judgement of a very important question which is the perception of the direction of the course of the car. Therefore, courtesy passing lights preferably have either a characteristic form or a characteristic colour or alternatively a combination of forms and or colours that enable it to be recognised by at least those drivers that need to assess the course of the car displaying it.Shown in Figure 6 a H, I, J and K, by way of illustration, are some outlines of dual cblour glasses for the illuminated area of courtesy passing lights reference letter W representing either a white, yellow, green or blue tinted region and R representing a red, green or amber coloured region of the glass, for example. Figures 7, 8 and 9 show examples of electric circuits associated with passing lights 12. The lights 12 may, in general, be operated manually They can be added to an existing vehicle as supplementary lights, as in Figure 8, when they can be either connected in parallel with lower beams, 11, through a two way switch 3 set in position 3a, to be used over non illuminated roads, or disconnected when switch 3 is set in position 3b to be used in town or, generally, over illuminated roads. In a new vehicle courtesy passing lights will preferably be connected as in Figure 7 through an intennediate contact 2c included in a selector switch 2 between positions 2a and 2b connecting, respectively, the headlamps circuit 10 and the pass lamp circuit 11. Figure 9 shows a circuit diagram for automatically controlled passing lights, both the usual or classical passing lights, 11, and courtesy passing lights 12Commercially available electronic circuits 6 control through relay 4 the energising of the electrical circuits for lower beams 11 and courtesy beams 12 when photoelectric cell 7 senses a change df light from the headlamps of an approaching vehicle from upper beams to lower beams.
