# Pressure sensing device.

## Abstract
A diaphragm 14 is formed in a silicon chip 10 by etching a rectangular cavity in one side thereof and piezoresistive resistors 18, 30 are formed in the other surface of the chip to sense stress changes on the diaphragm 14 due to pressure changes. At least one resistor 30 is placed along an edge 16 of the diaphragm where a sharp stress ridge 26 occurs. To avoid the problem of inaccurate placement of the resistor 30 relative to the ridge 26, the resistor is slanted with respect to the stress ridge at a small angle of 10 to 20 . This makes the resistor placement and cavity alignment much less critical thereby assuring greater uniformity of response from one device to another at the expense of signal size for a given pressure change on the device.
