# Apparatus for moving and orienting bottles.

## Abstract
Bottle handling apparatus receives bottles from a dis penser to a first transport region 34 between two parallel conveyor belts such as 38 which grip the bottle between them. The bottles are arranged in a random sequence of top leading and top trailing bottles. Bottles are transferred from the first transport region 34 to a second transport region 36 in the form of two further parallel conveyor belts such as 86 overlapping and located beneath the first transport region. The belts in the second transport region grip the bottles more firmly than those in the first transport region, taking over control of the bottles and accelerating them away from the first transport region. From the second transparent region the bottles are delivered to a discharge wheel 32 . In the transition zone between the first and second transport regions means are provided for changing the disposition of top leading bottles to a top trailing disposi tion, while not interfering with the position of bottles already in the top trailing position. In one embodiment the means includes a hook 158 engaging the open leading end and holding the bottle so that the bottle pivots around the hook under the action of the belts to reverse the disposition of the bottles. In a second embodiment the bottle is engaged by cam surfaces which have the effect of turning any bottles in top end leading disposition to an top end trailing disposi tion.
