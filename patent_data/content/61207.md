# Carburettor for internal combustion engines of motor vehicles.

## Abstract
A carburettor for engines of motor vehicles has a suction conduit 1 fed by fuel from a chamber 3 in which the fuel level is kept constant by a needle valve actuated by a float system with two floats 14, 15 , the walls 5, 6,7, 8 which delimit the chamber 3 laterally are vertical and vertical are the outer surfaces of the two floats 14, 15 , particularly those facing the walls of the chamber 3 , on the vertical line passing through the centre of gravity 33 of the figure 39 defined by sectioning a horizontal plane by the spatial figure included between the inner walls of the chamber 3 and the outer surfaces of the floats 14, 15 there is the main jet which is supported by a columnar structure having vertical walls, suspended from the cover of the carburettor, and which accommodates the main and idling circuits of the car burettor the planes of the level of the fuel contained in the chamber section the floats according to figures whose static moments relative to the fulcrum of the closure lever of the needle valve are substantially constant as the inclination of the carburettor relative to the horizontal plane varies.
