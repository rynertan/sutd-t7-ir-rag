# High vacuum molecular pump.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high vacuum molecular pump of the kind comprising at least two coaxial elements 1 and 2 mounted rotatably with respect to each other and at a small distance from each other, wherein a side of one of the elements 1 positioned opposite a side of another element 2 is provided with at least one helical groove 5 , and wherein a pump space 6 is present between these two sides of the elements, which pump space 6 is in communication with a gas supply 7 and a gas discharge 10, 8 . According to the invention an improved embodiment of a pump of the above kind is provided. In the pump according to the invention near an end of a pair of elements 1 and 2 a substantially annular gas supply chamber 9 , is present which is bounded by these elements 1 and 2 , said annular gas supply chamber 9 being in communication on the one hand with the gas supply 7 and on the other hand with the pump space 6 between the two elements 1 and 2 , the helical groove 5 extending into the annular gas supply chamber 9 , wherein the elements 1 and 2 bounding the annular gas supply chamber 9 are so shaped that the annular gas supply chamber 9 is relatively wide near the gas supply 7 , but narrows gradually downstream.
