## Description
EXERCISING APPARATUS AND METHOD Field and Background of Invention Planned programs of exercise have long been followed by persons training for athletic events of various types or pursuing a course of treatment for the rehabilitation of an illness, injury or the like. Many such planned programs of exercise have employed aids which have, in recent years, come to take the form of various apparatus or machines which facilitate the planned programs of exercise. Such apparatus, machines and methods have grown out of various concepts and studies regarding physiology and physiological development and function. One type of apparatus and method which has been used with significant success is full range exercise such as is possible, for example, through use of the apparatus of Jones, United States patent 3,858,873. Full range exercise as used with reference to such an apparatus and method, and as used in the description which follows, is a defined term. The defined term full range exercise refers to exercise having positive work negative work rotary form movement stretching prestretching automatically variable, balanced, direct resistance resistance in the position of full muscular contraction and unrestricted speed of movement The interested reader is referred to available publications for further explication of these characteristic features of full range exercises It is recognized, however, that not all exercise need be full range exercise as here defined.More specifically, certain exercise movements are compound movements which cannot attain the characteristics of full range exercise as listed briefly above due to the presence of lock out positions and non rotary movements, Such exercise may, for example, be realized through the use of apparatus such as that disclosed inMazman United States patent 3,905,599. The general field of such exercise and related apparatus and methods is here referred to as exercise physiology1,. The field of exercise physiology is related to sports medicine, being the field of medical study which is particularly directed to athletic sports and the like. While it has become possible, within these fields, to develop exercise programs which apply methods and apparatus of the types briefly. mentioned above with greater specificity than has been possible heretofore, exercise physiology and related areas of sports medicine have continued to be inherently imprecise. A major difficulty in accomplishing precise application of exercising programs has been in the difficulty of monitoring, directing and recording physiological performance. Brief Description of Invention It is an object of the present invention to improve the accuracy and precision by which physiological performance is monitored, directed and recorded. In realizing this object of the present invention, exercise apparatus having means engaged by a body portion of an exercising person operating the apparatus is improved by the provision of an open loop system for monitoring the physical effort exerted by the exercising person and for correlating the monitored effort exerted to a programmed standard. The open loop system displays a representation of the correlation of the monitored effort exerted to the programmed standard, in such a manner as to direct the physiological performance of the exercising person. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide, in an exercising apparatus of the type described and which has means for imposing resistance to musculature effecting movement of a body portion of an exercising person and for causing the musculature to perform positive and negative work during movement, means for responding to the exertion of force and for signalling the magnitude of the force exerted and the position of movement from which such force is exerted.Additionally, atmonitoring and display means operatively connected with the apparatus receives signals and displays for an exercising person operating the apparatus a representation of the work performed during movement of an exercised portion of the body. Yet a further object of the present invention is to accomplish, during exercise, an accurate and precise recording of the conditions of the exercise in terms of force exerted, body position from which force is exerted, speed of movement during exertion of force, and range of movement over which force is exerted. By recording such information during exercising, physiological performance may, for the first time, be systematically analyzed and developed to achieve desirable efficiencies and performance. Brief Description of Drawings Some of the objects of the invention having been stated, other objects will appear as the description proceeds, when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Figured is a perspective view of a leg extension exercise apparatus embodying the present invention Figure 2 is a side elevation view of the exercise apparatus of Figure 1, with certain cover components removed in order to make certain operating elements of the apparatus more readily visible Figure 3 is a front elevation view of the apparatus of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a view of a display incorporated in the apparatus of Figures 1 through 3, taken generally as indicated by the arrow 4 in Figure 2 Figure 5 is a graphic representation of one form of data display available from the apparatus of Figures L through 3, in accordance with the present invention Figure 6 is a schematic representation of the interconnection of and communication among certain apparatus used in accordance with the methods of this invention Figure 7 is a simplified flow chart representing certain steps in the methods of this invention Figure 8 is a view similar to Figure 1 of a second type of exercise apparatus in accordance with the present invention Figure 9 is a view similar to Figure 2 of the exercise apparatus of Figure 8 Figure 10 is a view similar to Figure 3 of the exercise apparatus of Figure 9 and Figures 11 and 12 are enlarged elevation views showing certain details of the apparatus of Figures 8 through 10. Detailed Description of Invention While the present invention will be described hereinafter with particular reference to the accompanying drawings, in which certain operating embodiments of the apparatus of the present invention are shown, it is to be understood at the outset of the description which follows that it is contemplated that apparatus and methods in accordance with the present invention may be varied from the specific forms described hereinafter, while still attaining the desired result of this invention. Accordingly, the description which follows is to be understood as a broad teaching disclosure directed to persons of appropriate skill in the appropriate arts, and not as limiting upon the scope of this invention. Referring now to Figures 1 through 3, an exercise apparatus embodying the present invention is there illustrated in the form of a leg extension apparatus generally indicated at 20. In the form illustrated, the apparatus 20 is a full range exercise apparatus having means engaged by body portions of an exercising person operating the apparatus. By means of mounting arrangements provided and operative coupling of elements with the body engaging means, the body engaging means rotates about an axis substantially coaxial with the axis of rotation of an engaged body portion of an exercising person and imposes throughout a full range of movement of the engaged body portion an automatically variable, balanced, direct resistance to the musculature effecting movement thereof. The imposition of resistance occurs while an unrestricted speed of movement is accommodated and so as to cause the musculature of the exercising person to perform both positive and negative work, and to be subjected to stretching and prestretching, all during rotary form movement of the engaged body portion. In the specifid form illustrated, the leg extension apparatus 20 has first and second roll members 21, 22 respectively engaged by shin surfaces of the left and right legs of an exercising person operating the apparatus 20. Each of the first and second roll members 21, 22 is mounted for rotation about an axis, by means of arm members 24, 25. In use, the axes of rotation of the arm members 24, 25 and roll members 21, 22 moving therewith are substantially coaxial with the axis of rotation at the knees of the person operating the apparatus 20. In the form of apparatus illustrated in Figures 1 through 3, means are provided which are operatively coupled with the first and second body engaging means 21, 22 for imposing throughout a full range of movement of the lower leg portions of the exercising person a resistance of the type described. In particular, each of the arm members 24, 25 is joined, near the axis of rotation thereof, with a stub shaft which extends through a side frame structure of the apparatus 20. The side frame structure s include side frame members 26, 28.Affixed to the respective shafts are sprockets 29, 30 about which is trained a chain 31. The chain 31 is formed as an essentially closed loop, passes over rear sprockets such as the sprockets 32, 34 mounted on a rear leg member 35, and are arranged so that upward movement of one roll member 21 brings about downward movement of the other roll member 22, and vice versa. As will be understood, the positive work being done by one lower leg for example, the left lower leg of an exercising person provides, through the chain 31, the resistance which brings about negative work done by the other body portion for example, the right leg . Thus, in the form of apparatus 20 illustrated in Figures 1 through 3, all resistance provided is provided by the exercising person. Further, the rate of work is governed by the exercising person.The apparatus 20 thus is both quite safe, in that no force is generated by the apparatus 20 itself, and requires the user to develop coordination skills in that the exercising person must consciously produce the required force and speed in exercising.These features relate to other characteristics of the present invention as described more fully hereinafter. In using the apparatus of Figures 1 through 3, an exercising person assumes a position seated upon a seat portion 36, which is mounted on the frame of the apparatus 20, and leans backward against a backrest portion 38. The user s legs, dangling forwardly over the front edge of the seat 36, are positioned for substantially coaxial alignment of the knee joint and the rotational axes for the roll members 21, 22. As so positioned, the user is supported so as to be able to readily view a display generally indicated at 40 and described more fully hereinafter. In accordance with important features of this invention, open loop means are operatively coupled with the body engaging means of the apparatus 20 for monitoring physical effort exerted by an exercising person operating the apparatus and for correlating monitored effort exerted to a programmed standard and for display ing, by means of the display generally indicated at 40, a representation of the correlation of monitored effort exerted to the programmed standard. It is significant to the present subject invention that the apparatus 20 includes an open loop means. As is familiar to persons skilled in the art of servomechanisms, a closed loop involves feeding back into an apparatus some signal derived from the action of the apparatus.In the specific instance of an exercise apparatus, such a closed loop might involve a servomechanism for exerting force with respect to an exercising person. Such servomechanisms have an inherent risk of injury, in that the servomechanism may become unstable or may fail in such a way as to inflict serious injury to the exercising person. That is not the case in the apparatus 20 of the present invention. In the apparatus 20 of the present invention, closure of the open loop, if any, occurs through the actions of the exercising person who, as briefly indicated above, maintains control over the force exerted, the speed of movement, and the consequent work done and physical effort exerted. In the form shown, this remains particularly true inasmuch as the sole source of force exerted is the exercising person.However, it is known that essentially the same characteristics follow where a weight stack or the like is used as a portion or all of the force exerting means.Use of a weight stack or the like simply presents an additional preset or predetermined factor to be taken into account in operation of the apparatus as described more fully hereinafter. In the form contemplated for the apparatus 20 of Figures 1 through 3, the open loop system includes means operatively coupled with the roll members 21, 22 for responding to exertion of force between those body engaging means and the engaged shin portions and for signalling the magnitude of force exerted. Preferably, the force responsive and signalling means comprises a load cell inserted into the chain 31 as a link thereof and which develops an appropriate analogue electrical signal. One form of load cell which has been employed successfully in apparatus such as the apparatus 20 ofFigures 1 through 3 is an electrical resistance strain gauge which varies in resistance as force is exerted thereon. Means are additionally operatively coupled with the body engaging roll members 21, 22 for responding to movement thereof and for signalling the position thereof.Preferably, the position responsive signalling means takes the form of a pair of potentiometers aligned with the shafts which carry the upper front sprockets 29, 30 and which define the axis of rotation for the roll members 21, 22. Potentiometers, used at this point, signal the position of the arms 24, 25 and the roll members 21, 22 by variations in resistance value. While it is recognized that the chaining together of the arms 24, 25 as described hereinabove, by means of the chain 31 which includes the load cell, essentially coordinates the movement of the two arms and the body engaging means carried thereby, opening the possibility of using a single position signalling means, it is preferred to provide two position signalling means as described above. The use of two signalling means reduces the possibility of introducing error due to chain stretch and the like. The load cell and the position signalling potentiometers are operatively connected with and supply signals to a monitoring and display means which includes the display visible to a user of the apparatus 20 in the housing 40 as briefly described above. The display, as visible to the user of the apparatus 20, is illustrated in Figure 4 and includes both analogue and digital information. The display means is operated under the control of digital processing means operatively connected with the analogue signalling means described hereinabove. The digital processing means preferably includes a microcomputer or processor forming an integral part of the apparatus 20. The digital processing means includes a stored program means for retaining instructions regarding at least one of a standard magnitude of force to be exerted by an exercising person and a standard rate of exertion of force by the exercising person and a standard number of repetitions of cyclical force exertion. Use of a microprocessor or microcomputer as a component of the apparatus 20, as described hereinabove, provides a range of significant advantages for the apparatus of the present invention, partioularly in an environment such as a laboratory, health club or spa in which a plurality of machines of various types may be present. The apparatus 20, with a microprocessor or microcomputer as a component thereof, is an intelligent machine .That is, the machine can identify a particular user from a code entered manually or by means of a coded card or the like and can communicate with a central processing unit which monitors a plurality of apparatus for retrieving from a memory which forms a portion of the apparatus 20tor which forms a portion of the central processing unit a particular exercise regimen to be followed by a particular user.Further, as the exercise regimen is carried out, the force applied by the exercising person and the position from which force is applied are monitored continuously and the information derived from the monitoring is processed. As a consequence, the user while operating.the apparatus 20 may view a display of the representation of the user s signalled effort and its correlation to the user s programmed regimen of exercise. In the particular form of the display illustrated in Figure 4, a plurality of generally horizontal indicator lines are provided, respectively indentified inFigure 4 at 41, and 43 through 46. Line 41 is used to display a progressive pacing signal which may, for example, take the form of a gradually extending lighted line moving from one side of the display toward the other at a timed rate. Such a display may be generated for example, by successively signalling a series of light emitting diodes. The other display lines 43 through 46 may have similar devices which may be successively signalled to provide an analogue display of a gradually extending lighted line.The display to be generated on the other display lines 43 through 46 is responsive to exercise effort exerted by the exercising person and thus will move from one side of the display tqward the other at a rate dependent upon the rate of movement of the exercising person. Further the signal will move from one to another of the lines 43 through 46 in response to variations in force exerted. That is, an exercising movement performed at an indicated rate but with low levels of force will be displayed only on line 43. An exercising effort which involved exertion of varying levels of force might begin a trace on the lowermost line 43, move upward through lines 44 and 45 to line 46, and then return back toward the lowermost line 43.As pointed out more fully hereinafter, a predetermined profile for the effort to be exerted by the exercising person and the pacing of that effort may be coordinated with signalled force and position so that, when the programmed regimen is followed, the user responsive trace or gradually extending line tracks constantly along a single predetermined line such as the line 44 in coordination with the pace of the progressive pacing signal extending along the line 41. With an apparatus such as the leg extension apparatus 20 described above, indicator signals to either side of the display area occupied by the lines 41 and 43 through 46 may be used to indicate which limb or body protion is to be engaged in doing positive work at any given moment. An exercise regimen designed for use with an apparatus such as the leg extension machine 20 typically will involve a predetermined number of repetitions of cycles of movement. As repetitions occur, a digital display presents numerical indicia of the number of repetitions which have been completed. At the conclusion of the number of repetitions programmed by the regimen, then the average force exerted and the average interval of time required for a repetition may be displayed as numerical indicia and combined into a score. Where a plotting attachment or a printer is associated with the central processing unit, the information thus derived may also be presented in graphic form.One form of graphic representation is illustrated inFigure 5, where curves have been plotted as the average of repetitions by the left leg and repetitions by the right leg for an exercising person using a leg extension machine. The present invention contemplates that operation of exercise machines in accordance with a stored program may involve operation of the apparatus with the microprocessor unit MPU which forms a portion of an individual apparatus or by cooperation between the MPU and a central processor unit CPU . In instances where operation is essentially under the control of anMPU, instructions regarding the standard magnitude of force to be exerted by the exercising person and the standard rate of exertion of force by the exercising person and the standard number of repetitions of cyclical force exertion will be entered directly at the MPU, either manually by the exercising person prior to beginning use of the apparatus 20 or from a stored record card such as a punched card or a magnetic record bearing card which may be inserted into a reader at the apparatus 20.Where operation is in coordination with a CPU, the greater information storage capabilities of the CPU may permit operation in accordance with a procedure wherein an individual merely identifies themselves to the CPU and the CPU thereupon loads into the MPU the instructions required. The components involved in operation as described hereinabove may be as schematically represented inFigure 6, where the analogue signalling devices incorporated into an exercising apparatus are indicated, as are the MPU, display and CPU. In circumstances where a CPU is used in association with exercise machines, the intelligent machine. characteristic of exercise apparatus in accordance with the present invention permits a single CPU to be shared amongt and communicate with a plurality of individual exercise machines. This is significant in that up to at least thirty two 32 distinct types of exercise machines are contemplated as being useful along the general lines described hereinabove with specific reference to the leg extension machine 20. Thus, a single CPU may monitor, process and display information derived from a plurality of exercise apparatus. The CPU may also direct the full exercise regimen of an individual using the facility so equipped. A simplified flow chart of the cooperation between a CPU and an MPU is represented in Figure 7. As will be noted, information is transferred between the MPU and CPU upon completion of each body portion movement in one particular direction. That is, a repetition is considered to be a full cycle of force exertion.A half repetition represents one half of a cycle of force exertion, during which one body portion is doing positive work and the other body portion is doing negative work, in the instance of the leg extension apparatus 20. As mentioned briefly above, it is contemplated that the present invention has utility with a number of exercise apparatus other than the leg extension apparatus 20 described hereinabove. For purpose of illustrating a different type of apparatus, Figures 8 through 12 have been included as showing a type of apparatus known as a hip back apparatus. In using the hip. and back apparatus generally indicated at 60, an exercising person assumes a supine position with the hip joints aligned with the axis of rotation of a pair of roll members 61, 62. The hip and back exercise apparatus 60 includes, as shown in Figures 8 through 10, a display generally indicated at 40 identical with the display used with the leg extension machine shown in Figures 1 through 3. The hip and back apparatus 60 is constructed and operates in a manner generally comparable to the leg extension apparatus 20 of Figures 1 through 3 as described more fully hereinabove. The hip and back apparatus 60 includes a chain 71 trained about a pair of sprockets 68, 69 so that arms 64, 65 mounting the roll members 61, 62 move in opposite directions with coordinated movement. A load cell 70 is incorporated in the chain. The hip and back apparatus 20 makes more clear the use of apparatus in accordance with the present invention as a force measuring apparatus or tensiometer. More particularly, first and second locking levers 74, 75 are provided and are actuable by a user of the machine to lock respective ones of the sprockets 68, 69 against rotation. As made more clear by Figures 11 and 12, such locking of a sprocket 69 against rotation occurs by insertion of a tooth or panel 78 into the teeth of the sprocket. In using an apparatus in accordance with the present invention as a force measuring apparatus or tensiometer, a respective one of the arms 64, 65 is brought to a position in which a forced measurement is to be made and the sprocket at the opposite side of the machine is locked by operating the appropriate lever.Thus, if the force exerted by a left leg is to be measured by determining the force exerted against one roll member 61, the locking lever 74 on the opposite side of the apparatus 60 is actuated to lock the remote sprocket 68. Upon this occurrence, the load cell 70 is located in the tight side of the closed loop of the chain 71. Thus, force exerted by a user of the apparatus 60 would be developed statically, with the body portion through which force was being exerted blocked against movement in the direction that force was being exerted, and force measurements would be available from a range of positions. As will be appreciated, use of exercise apparatus as described hereinabove with particular reference to two specific forms opens possibiliites for accurate determination of effort expended during an exercise regimen. By the same token, goals for an exercise regimen may be established from a basis of knowledge concerning an individual s abilities to sustain an extended effort and a desired goal for such an ability.Finally, where an individual s starting ability and a desired goal can both be adequately represented from information monitored and processed by the apparatus as described above, then the exercise activity of a user may be directed by means of the display 40 so.as to optimize achievement of the established goals.
