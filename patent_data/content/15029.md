# Vinyl ester resin composition thickened by a group II metal oxide or hydroxide.

## Abstract
Chemically modified thickenable vinyl esters are pre pared by reacting an ethylenically unsaturated monocarbox ylic acid with a polyepoxide in the presence of a small amount of a dicarboxylic acid. These resins are diluted with a copolymerizable monomer, such as styrene, blended with a Group II metal oxide or hydroxide and other additives, and cured with a free radical catalyst. The compositions can be used for coating, laminating, moulding, or as adhesive.
