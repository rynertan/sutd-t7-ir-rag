# A container closure.

## Abstract
A container closure of the composite type comprising a supporting and protecting part of plastics, having a central panel and a circumferential flange, and a thin metal foil acting as sealing label, attached to said part. A tearing denotation is formed in a multi step injection moulded weld zone and a sealing label is arranged to cover at least the weld zone of the container part. The weld zone includes abutment surfaces of the sequentially moulded parts acting as stop members preventing free relative movement between said parts after the weld zone is broken.
