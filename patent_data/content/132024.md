# Stabilised formulation suitable for use in pyrolytic glass coating process.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a stabilized composition for coat ing glass containers, and to its method of use. The method involves the steps of heating the surface of a glass container to at least 427 C, and spraying the surface of the glass with a glass coating formulation comprising monoalkyltin trihalide and about .5 to 10 parts by weight per hundred parts monoal kytin trihalide of a solubilizing material. The solubilizing mat erial can be a solvent such as monohydric alcohols, represen ted by the formula ROH, where R is a C₁ C₈ straight or branc hed chain group and dihydric alcohols represented by the formula, HO CH₂
