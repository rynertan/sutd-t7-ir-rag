# A heat insulating body incorporating a support device.

## Abstract
A support device for a heat insulating body formed of refractory fibres and a binder, e.g. burner blocks and peep holes, is formed from a sheet 1 of foraminous material. The sheet has a number of cuts 4 that extend from the edge of the sheet to form fingers 5 . Successive fingers are bent alternately above and below the plane of the sheet so that the cuts are opened up to receive the fibres. A stud 6 is welded to the sheet and protrudes from the body for attachment to a furnace wall for example. In another embodiment not shown the sheet is circular and radial cuts form fingers that are twisted about a radial axis. The stud 6 may have wings to resist rotation.

## Description
A HEAT INSULATING BODY INCORPORATING A SUPPORT DEVICE This invention relates to a heat insulating body formed of refractory fibres and a binder and incorporating a support device formed from a sheet of foraminous material. Heat insulating bodies are often formed by a slurry dewatering technique which involves feeding an aqueous slurry of the fibres and binder to a porous screen and drawing the liquid component of the slurry through the screen to deposit the fibres on the screen and so build up the body. The fibres tend to be deposited in layers and this can give rise to delamination problems separation of the layers which is particularly likely to occur in the region of objects incorporated into the body, such as support devices. British Patent Specification No. 2 033 559A describes a support device for use in fixing a heatinsulating panel to a substrate such as a furnace wall.That support device comprises a sheet of foraminous material which is bent so as to form a central base section and a pair of wing sections set at a specified angle to the base section. The device is incorporated into the panel and is used to fix the panel to the substrate by a suitable fixing device such as a bolt, which engages the base section. Whilst there is no doubt that the device described in that specification performs quite satisfactorily, the aim of the present invention is to devise a form of support device which is capable of reducing or even substantially eliminating the risk of delamination. According to the invention the sheet of foraminous material has one or more cuts and is bent in such a way that the cut or cuts are opened up to receive the fibres of the heat insulating body. The presence of such cuts may improve the keying of the fibres to the support device, and with many embodiments of the invention the liability of the body to delamination may be substantially reduced. The cut or cuts preferably extend from the peripheral edge of the sheet, to enable the cuts to be opened up to a greater extent. It is preferred to provide a number of cuts at intervals along the periphery of the sheet, arranged to divide an edge portion of the sheet into a plurality of fingers. The fingers may then be bent into different planes to improve the keying of the support device to the body. In one particular preferred arrangement, successive fingers are bent alternately above and below the plane of the sheet. This allows the fingers to extend into the body on both sides of the sheet, which has been found to assist in reducing the risk of delamination in the region of the device. In another preferred arangement the cuts are opened up by twisting each finger about an axis that lies in the plane of the sheet and extends along the respective finger. Again, this results in the material of the sheet being bent out of its plane on both sides to provide improved keying. The preferred configuration is one in which the sheet is substantially circular and the cuts are substantially radial, and the fingers are each twisted about a substantially radial axis. The maximum dimension of the sheet, as measured along its surface, is preferably between 25 mm and 100 mm. Below this range the device is liable to pull out of the body and above this range the body tends to be weakened in the region of the device. The size and distribution of the holes of the foraminous sheet depends to some extent on the aspect ratio and diameter of the fibres. Mineral wool fibres which may be used up to 7500C , alumino silicate fibres 1260 to 14500C or polycrystalline alumino fibres 16000C may, for example, be used. In most cases a sheet with holes of at least 2 mm diameter and spaced at 5 mm centres will give satisfactory results. The holes should not be so large that the sheet is significantly weakened. It has been found that in many instances these devices can even be used satisfactorily vith heatinsulating bodies such as burner blocks, peep holes and inspection door linings for furnaces, where the centre of gravity of the body is a substantial distance from its point of attachment to the furnace casing which results in a considerable stress in the body in the region of the support devices. There have previously been severe problems of delamination in these regions with many known support devices. The risk of delamination may be further reduced if the heat insulating body is such that it was formed by dewatering a slurry through a screen arranged substantially perpendicular to the plane of the foraminous sheet, so that the fibres lie more or less perpendicular to the plane of the sheet. Although the sheet may be adapted for engagement with a fixing element such as a bolt, e.g. by having a nut welded to it, preferably there is a fixing stud secured to the sheet and the body is formed around the sheet and the stud so that the stud protrudes from the heat insulating body for to attaching the body to a substrate. This avoids the need to engage a fixing element with the sheet when it is hidden from view inside the body. The stud is preferably secured perpendicular to the sheet. Preferably the fixing stud has one or more wings extending lengthwise of the stud. This helps to prevent rotation of the support device within the body. The wings are preferably foraminous to assist in keying the support device to the heat insulating body. The invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is an end elevation of one form of support device, Figure 2 is a sfde view of that support device, Figure 3 is an end elevation of a burner block incorporating four of those support devices, Figure 4 is a section through the burner block secured to a furnace wall by the support devices, Figure 5 is an end elevation of a further form of support device, and Figure 6 is a side view of that further support device. The support device shown in Figure 1 comprises a 50 mm square 18 swg stainless steel plate 1. Depending upon temperature requirements, 18 8 304 or 25 20 310 grade stainless steel sheet may be used for the plate.The plate contains a number of 2 mm diameter holes 2 spaced apart at 5 mm centres. Two opposite edges 3a, 3b of the plate each have a pair of parallel cuts 4a, 4b respectively, which divide each edge into three flat rectangular arms 5a, 5b respectively, all of equal size.Although the plate was initially flat, the arms have been bent out of the plane of the plate as shown inFigure 2. The two outer arms of one edge the upper edge 3a as shown have been bent below the plane of the plate and the middle arm has been bent above the plane of the plate, whereas the arms of the opposite edge 3b have been bent the other way, that is, the outer arms above and the middle arm below the plane of the plate. In their final positions the arms all lie at about 40 to the plane of the plate. A 5 mm diameter M10 stainless steel stud 6 having a screw threaded end portion 7, is welded to the centre of the plate. The stud is perpendicular to the plane of the plate with the threaded end free. Figures 3 and 4 show four of these support devices being used to secure a 450 mm cubic burner block 8 weighing about 20 kg to a furnace casing 9. The block comprises alumino silicate fibres and a binder, colloidal silica, and was formed by a slurry dewatering technique. The slurry was dewatered through a screen lying perpendicular to the plane of the plate 1. The support devices were held in position until the block was formed around them with only the threaded ends 7 of the studs 6 protruding from the block. After the usual drying stage, the block is secured to the furnace casing by locating the threaded ends of the studs in appropriate holes in the casing. Then nuts 10 are threaded onto the studs to hold the block to the casing, as shown in Figure 4. The support device shown in Figures 5 and 6 comprises a plate 1 having holes 2 of a similar size and spacing to those of the support device described above.But this time the plate 1 is circular and has four radial cuts 4 at equal intervals around its periphery, thus forming four flat arms 5 all of equal size and shape. The plate is again bent so that the cuts 4 are opened up, but here the arms are twisted about a radial axis, rather like a propeller. A partially screwthreaded stud 6 is welded to the centre of the plate 1, as in the device described above, but this tinie a pair of wings 11 are welded to diametrically opposite sides of the stud 6 on the thread less portion. The wings both lie in the same plane, which includes the axis of the stud 6. The wings 11 contain holes 12 of the same size and spacing as those of the plate 1. The support device of Figures 5 and 6 is made from the same materials as the device of Figures 1 and 2, the wings 11 being of the same material as the plate 1. In both cases, the threaded stud 6 may be formed of mild steel if the device is not to be subjected to particularly high temperatures. The device may be used in the same way as that ofFigures 1 and 2. The wings 11 serve to prevent rotation of the device when the nuts are tightened during the fixing process. Trials have shown that these two devices described above are superior to many other forms of support device in that delamination problems. are substantially eliminated.
