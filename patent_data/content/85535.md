# Solenoid.

## Abstract
A solenoid 10 comprises a pole element 14 and an armature 22 movable relative to the pole element 14 . The armature 22 and pole element 14 are arranged so that they define an air gap 28 . The air gap 28 , pole element 14 and armature 22 together form part of a magnetic circuit, also including a casing 12 and a pole part 18 within which the armature 22 slides. A coil 20 is arranged around the pole element 14 and is energisable to generate a magnetic force to attract the armature 22 towards the pole element 14 . The magnetic circuit includes two saturable members 34, 36 of material such that the saturable members 34, 36 saturate at a lower flux density that the flux density at which magnetic saturation occurs in the pole element 14 , arma ture 22 , casing 12 or pole part 18 . In use, the saturable members 34, 36 saturate at a low flux density and, thereafter, their reluctance increases with increasing flux density. This increasing reluctance counter acts the decreasing reluctance of the rest of the magnetic circuit and, consequently, the relationship between the force exerted on the armature and the current through the coil tends to linearity.
