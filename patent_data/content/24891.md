# Process for liberating metal ions from a water soluble glass at a controlled rate.

## Abstract
A controlled release glass is based on phosphorus pen toxide as the glass forming oxide, perhaps with up to 10 replaced by one or more of the oxides such as Si₂O₃, B₂O₃, GeO₂, As₂O₃ or Sb₂O₃. The glass contains a modifying oxide of a material to be released slowly, e.g. one of the oxides of Li, Na, K, Cs, Rb, Ca and Al, depending on the deficiency to be cured.
