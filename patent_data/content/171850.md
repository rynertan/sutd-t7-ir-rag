# Use of polyaminoamide resins as adhesion promoters of PVC plastisols.

## Abstract
The object of the invention are adhesion promoters for plastisols of polyvinylchloride polymers or copolymers, characterized in that they are constituted by polyaminoami dic resins obtained by means of the condensation of 1 equivalent of carboxylic acids, obtained by polymer ization of unsaturated fatty acids, of composition comprised within the following ranges 0 2 monomers, 10 50 dimers, 50 90 trimers, with from 1.0 to 2.2 equivalents of an heterocyclic amine of general formula
