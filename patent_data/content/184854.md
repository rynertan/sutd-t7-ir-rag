## Description
The present invention relate generally to a contact for vacuum interrupter, and particularly to a contact for vacuum interrupter which is splended in large current interrupting ability and breakdown voltage ability. Vacuum interrupters are expanding its application range rapidly because of having no need of maintainance, no environmental pollution and splended interrupting ability, and so on. And as a result, demands for higher breakdown voltage ability and larger current interrupting ability are becoming severe. On the other hand, among the abilities of the vacuum interrupter, there is a very great part which is determined by contact material in a vacuum container. For properties of contact material for vacuum interrupter to satisfy, there are large interrupting capacity, high breakdown voltage, small contact resistance, small separating force of contact, low wearing out of contact, small chopping current, splendid workability and sufficient mechanical strength, and the like. In using the conventional practical contact material, it is actually difficult to satisfy all of the above mentioned characteristics, and generally, such materials, whereby particularly important characteristics are realized corresponding to their purposes sacrificing other characteristics, are used for contact material. For instance copper Cu tungsten W contact material shown in published unexamined patent application Sho. 55 78429 is splendid in interrupting ability, so that it is used more for purpose of load switch and contactor, or the like. However this contact material is inferior to some extent in interrupting ability of large current. On the other hand, for instance copper Cu chrome Cr alloy shown in published unexamined patent application Sho. 54 71375 is splendid in interrupting ability, so that it is used more for interruptor, or the like, but it is inferior to above mentioned copper Cu tungsten W contact material in breakdown voltage ability. Besides above mentioned contact material for vacuum interrupter, some examples of contact material is being used in the gas or oil are given in literature of Funmatsu Yakin Gaku Powder Metallurgy published by the Dally Industrial news, Tokyo Japan. However, for instance, contact materials of silver Ag molybudenum Mo alloy and contact material of copper Cu molybudenum Mo alloy or the like shown in above mentioned literature are hardly used for vacuum interrupter now, because when they are used for contact for vacuum interupter the breakdown voltage ability of them are inferior to above mentioned copper Cu tungsten W contact material, and current interrupting ability of them are inferior to said copper Cu chrome Cr contact material. Reference is made to GB A 1346758, from where a contact material of Cu Cr Mo or Cu Cr Ta is known. As mentioned above, conventional contacts for vacuum interrupter have been used, making good use of their own characteristics but recently demands for adaptations thereof to larger current and higher voltage become more severe, and it have become difficult to satisfy demanded ability by the conventional contact material. Furthermore, for miniaturization of the vacuum interrupters, a contact material having more splendid characteristic is becoming demanded. The purpose of the present invention is to provide a improved contact material which are splendid in interrupting ability and breakdown voltage ability. The present invention is defined in claim 1.

This mixed powder is charged in a carbon die, and while it is heated for two hours in vacuum, a weight of 200 kg cm² is placed on it. Thus a block of the contact material is obtained. This example is shown as sample 32 in Table 3. Further, other contact materials than sample 52 which are made by the above mentioned method and respectively has different ratio of components are shown in Table 3. In Table 3, for samples 51 60 the copper amount is 60 volume , and for samples 61 70 the copper amount is 75 volume .

In Table 4 the sample 71 is for copper Cu molybudenum Mo alloy as comparative example obtained by infiltration method, the sample 72 is for copper Cu molybudenum Mo alloy obtained by sintering method, the sample 73 is for copper Cu molybudenum Mo alloy obtained by hot press method and sample 74 is for copper Cu chromium Cr alloy obtained by sintering method. Contact materials manufactured by the above mentioned methods are machine worked into an electrode of diameter 20 mm, and thereafter, electric conductivity is measured. A metal conductivity measurement apparatus Institut br, Forster GmbH Co. KG SIGMA TEST 2.067 is used for measurement of conductivity, and measured data are shown in Table 1, 2, 3 and 4. From the above mentioned data it is found that contact materials in the present invention are equal to, or more splendid than the conventional copper Cu chromium Cr contact material. Next, a vacuum interrupter is assembled by using the electrodes thus made and electrical characteristics are measured. FIG.1, FIG.2 and FIG.3 show the interrupting abilities of the contact materials of the present invention in Table 1, by taking the interrupting ability of the sample 71 comparative sample as 1. Since the contact materials in the present invention consist of four components, abscissas of FIGs.1 3 show component ratio of molybudenum Mo in compositioin other than copper Cu by volume taking the composition excluding copper as a reference 100 volume . And ordinates of FIGs.1 3 show ratio of interrupting abilities of the contact materials of the present invention taking the interrupting ability of copper Cu 50 volume molybudenum Mo comparative contact material sample 71 as 1. The curves are divided into FIGs.1 3 depending on proportions of tantalum Ta to compositions excluding copper Cu . That is, FIG.1 is for the contact materials of the present invention wherein tantalum Ta accounts for 10 volume of the composition excluding copper Cu . Curve 1 in FIG.1 shows the interrupting abilities of such contact materials of samples 1 3 in Table 1 of present invention, wherein copper accounts for 60 volume and tantalum occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 40 volume of the contact material. Curve 2 in FIG.1 shows the interrupting abilities of such contact materials of samples 11 13 in Table 1 of present invention, wherein copper accounts for 50 volume and tantalum Ta occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 50 volume of contact material. Curve 3 in FIG.1 shows the interrupting abilities of the contact materials of samples 21 23 in Table 1 of present invention, wherein copper accounts for 40 volume and tantalum occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 60 volume of contact material. Line 4 in FIG.1 shows the interruping ability of the copper Cu molybudenum Mo contact material of the comparative sample 71. Line 5 in FIG.1 shows the interrupting ability of conventional copper Cu chromium Cr contact material of sample 74. FIG.2 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of the contact materials of the present invention, wherein copper accounts for about 40 volume , about 50 volume and about 60 volume , and tantalum occupies 30 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 60 volume , about 50 volume and about 40 volume , respectively. Further FIG.3 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of contact materials in the present invention, wherein copper accounts for about 40, about 50 and about 60 volume , and tantalum occupies 50 volume of the composition other than copper, the compositiion being about 60 volume , about 50 volume and about 40 volume of contact material, respectively. From FIGs.1 3, it is obvious that the contact materials of the present invention have more splendid interrupting abilities than the comparative copper Cu molybudenum Mo contact materials, and furthermore, in comparison with the widely used conventional copper Cu chronium Cr contact material, the contact materials of the present invention are more splendid in interrupting ability. Concerning samples 10, 20 and 30 in Table 1 wherein tantalum occupies 70 volume of the composition other than copper, experiments are made for cases wherein chromium Cr and molybudenum Mo are respectively 15 volume . Though their interrupting abilities are not shown in the graphs, examples having 60 volume copper sample 10 , 50 volume copper sample 20 and 40 volume copper sample 30 have respectively 5.2 times, 4.2 times and 4.0 times as higher interrupting abilities as the comparative copper molybudenum contact material of sample 71. Accordingly, a component range of the contact materials having practical interrupting abilities is that tantalum is 4 42 volume , molybudenum is 2 51 volume and chromium is 2 51 volume . That is, by taking the composition other than copper as 100 volume , a range of tantalum amount is 10 70 volume , a range of molybudenum is 5 85 volume and a range of chromium is 5 85 . Since the ratios of copper amount to total amount of chromium, moluybudenum and tantalum are 40 60, 50 50 or 60 40, respectively, minimum amount of tantalum in the whole composition of the contact material including the copper becomes 4 volume and maximum amount of that becomes 42 volume In the similar expression, the amount of chromium or molybudenum in the whole compositiion of the contact materials including the copper become 2 minimum 51 maximum volume . Then, interrupting abilities of the present invention obtained by sintering method are shown in FIGs.4, 5 and 6. Since the contact materials consist of four components, abscissas of FIGs.4 6 show component ratio of molybudenum Mo in composition other than copper by volume taking the composition excluding the copper as a reference 100 volume . And ordinates of FIGs.4 6 show ratio of interrupting abilities of the contact materials of the present invention taking the interrupting ability of copper Cu 25 volume molybudenum Mo comparative contact material sample 71 as 1.

Curve 13 in FIG.4 shows interrupting abilities of contact materials of sample 31, 32 and 33 of the present invention wherein tantalum occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 40 volume . Further line 14 in FIG.4 is shows the interrupting ability of the copper molybudenum contact material of the comparative sample 72. Line 15 in FIG.4 shows the interrupting ability of conventional copper chromium contact material of sample 74. FIG.5 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of the contact materials of the present invention wherein copper accounts for about 75 volume and 60 volume , and tantalum occupies 30 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 25 volume and 40 volume of the contact material, respectively. FIG.6 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of contact materials wherein copper amount accounts for about 60 and about 75 volume and tantalum occupies 30 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 40 volume and about 25 volume of contact material, respectively. From FIGs.4, 5 and 6, it is obvious that the contact materials of the present invention have more splendid interrupting abilities than comparative copper molybudenum contact materials. And further, even in comparison with many conventional copper chromium contact materials, the contact materials of the present invention are more splendid in interrupting ability. Concerning samples 40 and 50 in Table 1 wherein tantalum occupies 70 volume of the composition other than copper, experiments are made for cases wherein chromium and molybudenum are 15 volume . Though their interrupting abilities are not shown in the graph, examples having 60 vp i,e copper sample 40 and 75 volume copper sample 50 have respectively 4.1 times and 3.9 times as high interrupting ability as comparative copper molybudenum contact material of sample 72. Accordingly a component range of the contact materials having practical interrupting abilities is such that tantalum is 2.5 28 volume , molybudenum is 1.25 34 volume and chromium is 1.25 34 volume . Next, interrupting abilities of contact materials of the present invention obtained by hot press method are shown in FIGs.7, 8 and 9. Abscissas of FIGs.7 9 show ratio of molybudenum in composition other than copper by volume taking the composition excluding the copper as a reference 100 volume , because the contact materials consist of four components. Ordinates of FIGs.7 9 show the ratios of interrupting abilities of the contact materials taking the interrupting ability of copper 25 volume molybudenum comparatiave contact material of sample 73 obtained by hot press method as 1. The curves are divided into FIG.7, FIG.8 and FIG.9 depending on ratios of tantalum to compositions excluding copper. That is, FIG.7 is for the contact materials in the present invention wherein tantalum accounts for 10 volume of composition other than copper. Curve 20 in FIG.7 shows interrupting abilities of such contact materials of samples 61, 62 and 63 in the present invention wherein tantalum occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 25 volume of contact material. Curve 21 in FIG.7 shows interrupting abilities of contact materials, samples 51, 52 and 53, wherein tantalum occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 40 volume of contact material. And further, line 22 in FIG.7 shows the interrupting ability of comparative copper molybudenum contact material of sample 73, line 23 in FIG.7 shows interrupting ability of conventional copper chromium contact material of sample 74. FIG.8 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of contact materials in the present invention wherein copper amount accounts for about 75 and 60 volume and tantalum occupies 30 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 25 volume and 40 volume of contact material, respectively. FIG.9 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of contact materials wherein copper amount accounts for about 75 and 60 volume , and tantalum occupies 50 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 25 volume and 40 volume of contact material, respectively. From FIG.7, FIG.8 and FIG.9, it is obvious that the contact materials in the present invention have more splendid interrupting abilities than comparative copper molybudenum contact materials and furthermore, in comparison with many widely used conventional copper chromium contact materials, the contact materials in accordance with the present invention have more splendid interrupting abilities. Concerning samples 60 and 70, wherein experiments are made for cases wherein chromium amount and molybudenum amount are respectively 15 volume , though their interrupting abilities are not shown in the graphs, examples having 60 volume copper sample 60 and 75 volume copper sample 70 have respectively as 4.2 times and 4.8 times higher interrupting abilities as comparative copper molybudenum contact material sample 73 . Accordingly, component range of the contactg materials having practical interrupting abilities is that tantalum is 2.5 28 volume , molybudenum is 1.25 34 volume and chromium is 1.25 34 volume . Furthermore, from curve 1 in FIG.1, curve 13 in FIG.4 and curve 21 in FIG.7, for contact materials in the present invention wherein copper accounts for about 60 volume and tantalum occupies 70 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 40 volume of contact materials, it is possible to compare difference of the interrupting abilities depending on manufacturing method. And thereby, it is found that interrupting abilities do not differ so much depend on the manufacturing method. And further, from FIG.2, FIG.5 and FIG.8, and FIG.3, FIG.6 and FIG.9, concerning the contact materials wherein copper occupies 60 volume , it is similarly possible to compare the difference of interrupting abilities and it is found that the ones made by the infiltration method is rather splendid in interrupting ability than those by other two methods. However, even the contact materials obtained by the sintering method and the hot press method have more splendid interrupting ability than the conventional copper chromium contact material. Therefore, in spite of difference of the manufacturing method, the contact materials of the present invention are technically advantageous in the range wherein tantalum amount is 2.5 42 volume , molybudenum amount is 1.25 51 volume and chromium is 1.25 51 volume , regardless of manufacturing method, such as infiltration method, sintering method or hot press method. Furthermore, taking notice of molybudenum and chromium amount in contact materials, there is a tendency wherein as molybudenum amount becomes larger than chromium amount, contact ability becomes better. Though the detailed reason thereof is not necessarily ovbious, one reason considered by the inventors is that electric conductivity is lowered by solid solving of chromium into copper. This tendency is observed remarkably in case of the infiltration method, and therefore, in practiced use of the contact material, it is desirable that the content of molybudenum is larger than chromium. On the other hand, for other electrical characteristic, breakdown voltage ability is measured. The measurement is made by using conditioning method wherein AC voltage is applied gradually under the condition that gap between a pair of contacts is fixed constant. And then, a judgement of breakdown voltage ability is made by comparing such a voltage that discharge does not yet take place for a predetermined time, with a reference voltage of the case of conventional copper chromium contact material. As a result, the breakdown voltage abilities of contact materials of the present invention are in a range of 1.2 1.5 times as high as the conventional copper chromium contact material. Moreover, from an experiment wherein making a current by connecting the contacts and breaking a current by opening the contacts are alternately repeated, a high voltage is applied to the opened contacts every time when the contacts are opened, and observations whether discharging across the contacts takes place or not are made, a rate of occurrence of the discharging is obtained by the following expression It is found that in the contact materials of the present invention, the probability of discharge was from as low as 1 5 to 1 3 of that of the conventional copper chromium contact material. And furthermore, it is found that the contact materials of the present invention are splendid in breakdown voltage ability. Then an explanation is given to examples of contact materials consisting of copper, chromium, molybudenum and niobium. The contact materials are made by powder metallurgy method, which is further classified to three kinds of methods, infiltration method, sintering method and hot press method. The first manufacturing method of contact material by the infiltration method is as follows. Chromium powder of under 45µm in particle diameter, molybudenum powder of 3µm in average particle diameter, niobium powder of under 40µm in particle diameter and copper powder of under 40µm in particle diameter and copper powder of under 40µm in particle diameter are weighed respectively in the ratio of 42.5 43.4 9.9 4.4, thereafter they are mixed for two hours, and next the mixed powder is charged in a known metal die and pressed under weight of 1 ton cm² to form a green compact. Next the green compact is fired for two hours in a vacuum at the temperature of 1000 C, thus presintering green compact is obtained. Thereafter, a lump of oxygen free copper is put on the presintering green compact, and is kept for one hour under hydrogen atmosphere at the temperature of 1250 C, and the contact material is obtained by infiltration of non oxygen copper into the presintered green compact. Final ratio of component of the above mentioned contact material is shown as sample 112 in Table 5. Further, other contact materials than the sample 112, which are made by the above mentioned method and respectively have different ratio of components, are shown in Table 5. For sample 101 110 the target copper amount which is an intended target value of copper when the contact material is finally completed, is 60 volume , for sample 111 120 the target copper amount is 50 volume and for sample 121 130 the target copper amount is 40 volume . The second manufacturing method of the contact material by sintering method is as follows.

Next, this mixed powder is charged in a known metal die and pressed under weight of 3.3 ton cm² to form a green compact. Then, this green compact is fired for two hours under hydrogen atmosphere at the temperature of 1075 1080 C under the melting point of copper . Thus, the contact material is obtained. This example is shown as sample 132 in Table 6. Furfther, other contact materials than sample 132 which are made by the above mentioned method and respectively have different ratio of components are shown in Table 6. In Table 6, for sampales 131 140 the copper amount is 60 volume and for samples 141 150 the copper amount is 75 volume . The third manufacturing method of contact material by the hot press method is the same as above mentioned sintering method as far as the part of mixing the metal powder, and the mixed powder which is the same as above mentioned example is used. The mixed powder is charged in a carbon die, and while it is heated for two hours in vacuum, a weight of 200 kg cm² is thereon thus a block of the contact material is obtained. This example is shown as sample in Table 7. Further, the contact materials other than sample 52 which are manufactured by above mentioned method and are respectively have different ratio of components are shown in Table 7. In Table 7, for samples 151 160 the copper amount is 40 volume , and for sampales 161 170 copper amount is 75 volume . Further, conventional contact materials are shown as comparative samples in above mentioned Table 4. Contact materials manufactured by above mentioned methods are machine worked into electrode of diameter 20 mm, and thereafter, electric conductivity is measured. A metal conductivity measurement apparatus Institut br, Föster GmbH Co. Kg SIGMA TEST 2067 is used for measurement of conductivity, and measured data are shown in Table 5, 6 and 7. Conventional contact materials are shown in Table 4. From the above mentioned data, it is found that contact materials in the present invention are equal to, or more splendid than the conventional copper chromium contact material of sample 74. Next, a vacuum interrupter is assembled by using the electrodes thus made and electrical characteristics are measured.

From FIGs.10 12, it is found that the contact materials of the present invention have more splendid interrupting abilities than comparative copper molybdenum contact materials. Furthermore, in comparison with widely conventional copper chromium contact materials, the contact materials of the present invention are more splendid in interrupting abilities in whole range. Further, concerning samples 110, 120 and 130 wherein niobium occupies 70 volume of composition other than copper, experiments are made for cases wherein chromium and molybdenum are respectively 15 volume . Though their interrupting abilities are not shown in the graphs, examples having 60 volume copper sample 110 , 50 volume copper sample 120 and 40 volume copper sample 130 have respectively 4.7 times, 4.2 times and 3.5 times as higher interrupting ability as the comparative copper molybdenum contact material of sample 71.

Moreover, concerning sample 140 and 150 wherein niobium occupies 70 volume of the composition other than copper, experiments are made for cases wherein chromium and molybudenum amount are respectively 15 volume . Though their interrupting abilities are not shown in the graph but examples having copper 60 volume sample 140 and copper 75 volume sample 150 have respectively 4.1 times and 3.9 times as high interrupting ability as the comparative copper molybudenum contact material sample 72 . Accordingly, component range of the contact materials having practical interrupting abilities, niobium is from 2.5 volume samples 141, 142 and 143 to 28 volume sample 140 , molybudenum is from 1.25 volume samples 141, 144 and 147 to 34 volume sample 133 , and chromium is from 1.25 volume to 34 volume . Next interrupting abilities of contact materials of the present invention obtained by hot press method are shown in FIG.16, 17 and 18. Abscissas of FIGs.16 18 show ratio of molybudenum in composition other than copper by volume taking the composition excluding the copper as a reference 100 volume , because the contact materials consist of four components. Ordinates of FIGs.16 18 show the ratio of interrupting abilities of the contact materials taking the interrupting ability of the copper 25 volume molybudenum comparative contact material obtained by hot press method as 1. The curves are shown divided into FIGs.16 18 depending on ratios of niobium to composition other than copper. That is, FIG.16 is for contact material of the present invention wherein niobium accounts for 10 wt of composition other than copper. Curve 20 in FIG.16 shows interrupting ability of the contact materials of samples 161, 162 and 163 of the present invention, wherein copper amount accounts for about 75 volume , and niobium occupies for 10 of the composition other than copper, the composition being about 25 volume of the contact material. Curve 21 in FIG.7 shows interrupting ability of contact materials samples 151, 152 and 153 wherein copper amount accounts for about 60 volume , and niobium occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 40 volume of contact material. And further line 22 in FIG.16 shows interrupting ability of copper molybudenum contact material of sample 73 for reference, and line 23 in FIG.16 shows the interrupting ability of the conventional copper chromium contact material of sample 74. FIG.17 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of contact materials in the present invention, wherein copper amount accounts for about 75 and 60 volume , and niobium accounts for 30 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 25 and 40 volume of contact material, respectively. FIG.18 similarly shows the interrupting abilities of contact materials wherein niobium accounts for 50 volume of composition other than copper. From FIGs.16 18, it is obvious that the contact materials of the present invention have more splendid interrupting ability than comparative copper molybudenum contact material, further, even in comparison with widely conventional copper chromium contact material, the contact materials in the present invention have more splendid interrupting ability. Furthermore, concerning sample 160 and 170 wherein niobium accounts for 70 volume of the composition other than copper, experiments are made for cases wherein chromium and molybudenum amount are respectively 15 volume . Though their interrupting abilities are not shown in the graphs, examples having 60 volume copper sample 160 and 75 volume copper sample 170 have respectively 4.1 times and 4.7 times as high interrupting ability as comparative copper molybudenum contact material sample 73 . Accordingly, a component range of the contact materials having practical interrupting ability, niobium is from 1.5 volume samples 161, 162 and 163 to 28 volume sample 160 , molybudenum is from 1.25 volume samples 161, 164 and 167 to 34 volume samnple 153 , and chromium is from 1.25 volume sample 163, 166 and 169 to 34 volume sample 151 . Further, from curve 1 in FIG.10, curve 13 in FIG.13 and curve 21 in FIG.16, for contact material in the present invention, wherein copper accounts for 60 volume and niobium occupies 10 volume of the composition other than copper, the composition being 40 volume of contact material, it is possible to compare the interrupting abilities which are different from each other depending on manufacturing method. And thereby, it is found that the infiltration method has rather splendid interrupting ability than the other two method. However, even the contact materials obtained by the sintering method and the hot press method are more splendid in the interrupting ability than the conventional copper chromium contact material. Therefore in spite of difference of the manufacturing method, the contact materials in the present invention are technically advantageous in the range wherein niobium amount is 2.5 42 volume , molybudenum amount is 1.25 51 volume , and chromium amount is 1.25 51 volume , regardless of manufacturing methods such as infiltration method, sintering method or hot press method. Furthermore, taking notice of molybudenum and chromium amount in contact materials, there is a tendency that when molybudenum amount becomes larger than chromium amount, contact ability becomes better. Though the detailed reasons thereof is not necessarily obvious, one reason considered by the inventors is that electric conductivity is lowered by solid solving of chromium into copper. This tendency observed remarkably in case of the infiltration method, and therefore, in practical use of the contact material, it is desirable that the content of molybudenum is larger than chromium. Interruption of the current of 7.2 KV and 12.5 KA is realized by sample 112. On the other hand, for other electrical characteristics, breakdown voltage ability is measured. The measurement is made by conditioning method wherein AC voltage is applied gradually on the condition that gap between a pair of contacts is fixed constant, and then, judgement of breakdown voltage ability is made by comparing such the voltage that discharge does not take place for a predetermined time with a reference voltage of case of the conventional copper chromium contact material. As a result, the breakdown voltage abilities of contact materials of the present invention are in a range of 1.2 1.5 times as high as conventional copper chromium contact material. Moreover, from an experiment wherein making a current by connecting the contacts and breaking a current by opening the contacts are alternately repeated, a high voltage is applied to the opened contacts every time when the contacts are opened, and observations whether discharging across the contacts takes place or not are made, a rate of occurrence of the discharging is obtained by the following expression It is found that in the contact material in the present invention, the probability of discharge was from as low as 1 5 to 1 3 of that of the conventional copper chromium contact material. And it is found that the contact materials of the present invention are splendid in breakdown voltage ability. As mentioned above, according to the present invention, vacuum interrupter which is splendid in interrupting ability and breakdown voltage ability is obtainable.
