# Method and apparatus for shaping and aiming narrow beams.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for using a linear frequency chirp in a transmitter receiver 14 16 having a correlator to synthesize a narrow beamwidth pattern from otherwise broadbeam transducers when there is relative velocity bet ween the transmitter receiver and the target. The chirp is so produced in a generator 20 in bandwidth, B, and time, T, as to produce a time bandwidth product, TB, that is increased for a narrower angle. A replica of the chirp produced in a generator 26 is time delayed and Doppler shifted for use as a reference in receiver 16 for correlation of received chirps from targets. This reference is Doppler shifted to select targets preferentially, thereby to not only synthesize a narrow beam but also aim the beam in azimuth and elevation.
