# Regenerating alkanolamine desulfurizer solutions.

## Abstract
A method for regenerating a spent alkanolamine absorb ing solution containing absorbed H₂S and CO₂ in two desorption stages to produce two separate acid gas streams. The first acid gas stream that contains substantially all of the H₂S is sent to a sulfur recovery system and the second acid gas stream that is primarily CO₂ is vented to the atmosphere. The desorption stages are connected in series and both are operated at substantially the same above atmospheric press ure within the range of 8 12 psig 1.54 1.82 atm abs .
