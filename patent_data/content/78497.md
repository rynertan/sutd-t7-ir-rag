# Pump drive circuit.

## Abstract
In a pump drive circuit, a power source voltage signal supplied to the pump 38 is phase controlled by a triac 40 connected between the pump 38 and the power source 44 . The period of triggering the triac 40 is determined by a time constant circuit of a UJT 66 , a capacitor 74 and a resistor circuit 70, 78 . The power source voltage signal has its frequency discriminated by a frequency discrimination circuit 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 . The resistance value of the resistor circuit 70, 78 is determined in accordance with the result of the discrimination. Accordingly, the pump 38 is applied with a voltage signal phase controlled in accordance with the power source frequency, and is thus driven at a predetermined value.
