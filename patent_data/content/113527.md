# Tube couplings.

## Abstract
In a tube coupling of the kind comprising a body member 10 with a bore 13 having an axially tapered portion 18 , a collet 12 having arms 23 extending into said portion of the bore, the tapered portion being such that axially outward movement of the collet arms engaging the tapered portion causes the collet arms to be pressed inwardly for gripping a tube 11 in the bore, the body member 10 is formed of inner and outer parts 31,30 or 41,40 with at least the inner part 31 or 41 being of plastics material which, by ultrasonic vibration is caused to enter into recesses or grooves 32 in the outer part 30 or 40 .
