## Description
Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel fluoroacrylate adhesive compositions which are useful for splicing optical fibers or joining optical fibers to other optical elements or devices.Background of the Invention Optical fibers have been spliced and joined to other optical elements and devices using a variety of different methods, and a variety of different materials have been used as adhesives or coupling agents. One of these methods involves the use of photocurable adhesives. Examples of photocurable adhesives and their use in splicing optical fibers are shown in U.S. patents 3,864,019 to Smolinski et al., 4,057,488 to Miller, and 4,443,494 to Gonser and U.K. patent 2,047,913 to Onstott et al. claiming priority from U.S. application serial number 28,965 filedApril 11, 1979 , the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. It has been recognized that in addition to matching the refractive index of the adhesive material to the refractive index of the optical fiber or the core of the optical fiber, the adhesive material after it is cured should be capable of withstanding certain environmental conditions. The importance of the environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, is discussed in copending U.S. application serial number 524,959 filed August 19, 1983, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. It is desired to have an adhesive comvosition for splicing optical fibers which has a refractive index which will exactly match thg refractive index of the optical fiber and particularly the core of the optical fiber gnd will withstand the environmental conditions normally encountered in service. It is also desired to have an adhesive composition in which the refractive index of the cured adhesive composition can be easily adjusted to match the various refractive indices of the various optical fibers which must be spliced or connected to other optical elements or devices.Description of the Invention This invention provides for a curable composition comprising a fluoroacrylate having the formula R1 R2 CH CF2 n CH R1 R2 wherein R1 and R2 are acrylate, methacrylate or hydrogen, methacrylate or hydrogen, n is an integer of 1 through 5, and at least one R1 is acrylate or methacrylate and at least one R2 is acrylate or methacrylate and a non fluoro, polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomer having 2 to 7 acrylate or methacrylate groups and being pre sent in an amount effective to adjust the refractive index of the cured composition to a desired value.The fluoracrylate can be prepared as described in U.S. patent 3,055,932 to Verbanic et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The preferred fluoracrylate for splicing typically available commerical optical fibers is a diacrylate, i.e., where one R1 is hydrogen and one R2 is hydro gen, and wherein n is 3. Thus the preferred fluoracrylate is 2,2,3,3,4,4 hexafluoropentamethylene diacrylate, which has a refractive index of 1.41 as a liquid and when cured by photopolyermization has a refractive index of 1.43. The nonfluoro polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomers are well known in the art as illustrated by the patents referred to herein. Examples of such polyfunctional monomers include trimethylolpropanetriacrylate, pentaerythritoltetraacrylate, dipentaerythritolmonohydroxypentaacrylate, dipentaerythritolhexaacrylate, tris 2 hydroxyethyl isocyanurate, trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate and pentaerythritoltrimethacrylate. A particularly preferred polyfunctional acrylate is called dipentaerythritol monohydroxypenta acrylate. Preferred polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomers have 3 or 4 acrylates and or methacrylate groups and a molecular weight in the range of 250 to 350.The preferred polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomers have no more than one hydroxyl group present, because it is believed that multiple hydroxyl groups will have an adverse effect on optical fiber splices in certain ranges of infrared light spectra. The class of fluoroacrylates useful in this invention when fully cured will have a refractive index in the range of about 1.39 to about 1.45. The polyfunctionalacrylates when cured will have a refractive index in the range of about 1.49 to about 1.52.Commercially available optical fibers typically have a refractive index at the core of about 1.45 to 1.47. By mixing the proper proportion of the fluoroacrylate and the nonfluoro polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate, the adhesive composition when cured will have a refractive index which will exactly match the refrac tive index of the core of the optical fiber. herefore, this invention pro vifzs Åa simple adhesive compositiÏn Which can be adjusted to have the desired refrtive index when cured by adjusting the amount of the nonfluoro polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomer present in the curable adhesive composition. The compositions of this invention may contain up to about 98 by weight fluoroacrylate but generally will be up to about 90 , and preferably up to about 80 and most preferably up to about 70 fluoroacrylate. The nonfluoro polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate may be present in an amount up to about 95 by weight, but generally will be present up to about 50 by weight, depending on the refractive index desired. In many applications it will, only be desirable to use up to 25 or even 5 by weight.The oligomer may be present in the range of 0 to 50 by weight and generally will be in the range of about 5 to 35 , depending on the viscosity desired in the curable composition and or on the plasticizing effect desired in the cured composition. The compositions of this invention may be cured thermally or chemically, but in many uses are best used as a photocurable compositions. Consequently they may contain an effective amount of a photoinitiator. Photoinitiators for acrylate and methacrylate materials are well known in the art and are typically used in small amounts, for example up to about 3 by weight of the total composition.Examples of photoinitiators of the type useful in the compositions of this invention include the benzoin ether type, such a benzoin methyl ether or benzoin isopropyl ether, substituted benzoin ethers such as anisoin methyl ether, substituted acetophenones such as 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone, or 2,2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone, and substituted alpha ketols such as 2 methyl 2 hydroxypropiophenone, isobutyl benzoin ether, 2 hydroxy 2 methyl l phenyl propan l one, isoproyl benzoin ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin methyl ether, benzil, hydroxy cyclohexyl phenyl ketone, isopropyl thioxanthone, chlorine functional substituted benzophenone Acetocure X 500 , halogen substituted alkyl alkylketone Sandoray 1000 . The photoinitiators are normally used in amounts from about 0.01 to 5.0, and more usually, 1 to 3 parts per hundred parts by weight of the adhesive composition of this invention.A preferred photoinitiator for the compositions of this invention is hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone Irgacure 184, Ciga Geigy . In some applications it may be necessary to adjust the viscosity of the composition of this invention. For example, a common method of joining optical fibers is to place the adhesive in a tube or sleeve, insert into the tube optical fibers from each end of the tube into the adhesive present, then photocure the adhesive composition. In such an application the uncured adhesive composition must have a viscosity which is high enough so that the adhesive will be retained in the tube by surface tension or capillary forces, but the adhesive cannot have such a high viscosity that it is difficult to insert the ends of the fibers into the adhesive present or move the fibers in the adhesive for purposes of alignment of the optical fibers before curing the adhesive composition. The adhesive composition of this invention can be used in some applications at a very low viscosity or the viscosity can be adjusted upward when necessary for use in certain other applications. When used in a tube or sleeve as described in copending applications serial number 465,362 filedFebruary 10, 1983, and serial number 464,805 filed February 9, 1983. It is generally desirable to have a viscosity of the uncured adhesive to be in a range of about 200 to 5,000 centipoise at room temperature. The adhesive compositions of this invention may contain an acrylate or methacrylate oligomer which does not affect the refractive index of the cured adhesive to any significant degree which cannot be compensated for by changing the amount of the nonfluoro polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomer present in the curable composition. The oligomer additive for viscosity adjustment also should not adversely affect the crosslink density of the cured composition. The oligomer can also provide flexibility in the cured adhesive to reduce internal stresses and potential cracking of the cured adhesive. The oligomer can also reduce the shrinkage which may occur when the adhesive composition of this invention is cured. The oligomers useful in this invention are of the acrylic or methacrylic polyester type.Other oligomers known in the art to not interfere with the required optical properties, such as some epoxy and urethane type oligomers may be used. Preferably the oligimer may have 2 to 6 acrylate groups. A particularly preferred oligomer is a multifunctionally acrylated aliphatic polyester having a molecular weight of 2000 and a functionality of 6 Ebecryl 830 available form Union Carbide Belgium . This preferred oligomer can be added to a fluoroacrylate composition of this invention up to about 25 by weight without affecting the refractive index of the cured composition of the fluoroacrylate and nonfluoro polyfunctional acrylate or methacrylate monomer. The compositions of this invention may be thermally or chemically cured. However, for splicing optical fibers photocuring is preferred. It has also been observed that it is desirable to provide a photoinitiator and a light intensity which produces a very fast cure of the adhesive composition of this invention. It is believed that the faster the composition cures, the more completev composition cures and the per the crosslink den sity may be. The quick, complete curing is believed desirable in order to obtain the stability in the cured composition. When used as optical adhesives the compositions of this invention should be of high purity and carefully filtered to remove any particulate matters which would interfere with the optical transmissivity. This invention also provides for a method of splicing optical fibers which comprises applying the composition of this invention to an optical fiber and curing the composition.Example To illustrate a typical composition according to this invention, the following composition was prepared 70 by weight 2,2,3,3,4,4 hexafluoropentamethylene diacrylate 5 by weight dipentaerythritol monohydroxypenta acrylate 25 by weight acrylated aliphatic polyester oligomer having functionality of 6 and molecular weight of 2000 Ebecryl 830, UCB 2 parts by weight based on the weight of the above com position l hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone Irgacure 184, Ciba Geigy The viscosity of the uncured composition was approximately 500 centipois at room temperature. The refractive index nd25 of the uncured composition was 1.42 and the refractive index of the cured composition after photocuring was 1.46. The composition was used to splice optical fibers of both the multimode and monomode types and acceptable splices were made having less than 0.1 dB loss. The splices also passed a test of temperature cycling from 40 to 600C at three cycles per day for at least ten days, thermal aging at 600C for at least ten days and humidity exposure test at 95 relative humidity at 400C for at least ten days hours with no appreciable variance in attenuation.
