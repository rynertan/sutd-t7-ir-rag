# Apparatus for determining the degree of consistency of a feature in a region of an image that is divided into discrete picture elements.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an apparatus for determining the degree of consistency of a feature in a region of an image that is divided into discrete picture elements, said feature being represented by vector valued signals, one for each picture element, the vector direction describing the feature type and the vector magnitude describing the certainty in the feature assertion. The invention is characterized by a first unit 4 for weighted summation of the vectors in said region after prede termined rotations thereof, a second unit 5 for weighted summation of the magnitudes of the vectors in said region, and a norming unit 6 for norming the output signal from the first summation unit 4 with respect to the sum of the output signal from the second summation unit 5 and a reference signal.
