# Fluid actuator with remote lock release assembly.

## Abstract
Actuator 1 includes a lock mechanism 20 for locking the actuator against movement in one end position, and a separate lock release assembly 35 exteriorly mounted on the side of the actuator housing 3 . The lock release assembly includes a toggle linkage 41 directly engageable with the movable lock part 21 to disengage the lock 20 when a suitable force is applied to the toggle linkage exteriorly of the actuator. A lock spring 30 is located immediately between the movable lock part 21 and actuator piston 4 for resetting the lock as the actuator nears such one end position.
