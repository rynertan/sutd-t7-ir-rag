# HORIZONTAL MEDIA MILL

## Abstract
A horizontal media mill comprising a cantilevered shaft 12 extending from a motor 10 into a vessel 18 in which a rotor 16 mounted on the shaft agitates a grinding media 2 and the product being milled. A cup shaped screen 32 and a cup shaped end cover 44 fit over the free end of the rotor and are removably mounted on the end of the vessel 18 . The screen filters the media from the milled product as the product flows to an outlet 49 in the end cover. The rotor is of a one piece polymeric construction and slides off the shaft to be removable when the screen is removed. The mill is tiltable to facilitate cleaning, and includes an integrated hydraulic system 72, 74 which tilts the mill 62 , cools the vessel 16 , drives the product pump 76 , and provides pressure for a seal 52 where the shaft 12 enters the vessel 18 .
