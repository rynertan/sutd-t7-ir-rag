# Turbine assembly.

## Abstract
A radial inflow turbine having an axial discharge divided into two concentric passages. The inner concentric passage or passages may be selectively blocked by means of a valve to accommodate a first range of flow rate. At higher flow rates, the valve is open to increase the effective nozzle area of the secondary nozzles at the discharge of the turbine wheel.
