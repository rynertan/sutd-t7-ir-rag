# Coaxial cable connector.

## Abstract
A connector for impedance matched low capacitance connection to coaxial cable includes an electrically conductive housing having a pair of intersecting channels therein. A first channel receives the insulated conductor of a coaxial cable and the other channel seats an insulator which supports a con tact element in the first channel for insulation piercing of the insulated conductor. The housing is electrically connected to the shield of the coaxial cable and the transition through the contact element to ancillary apparatus is carried out with elec trical equivalence to the coaxial cable environment.
