# Tracking system.

## Abstract
This system comprises positionable elements 21, 22 , rotary video heads 1, 2 mounted on the positionable ele ments, a control head 17 , a frequency generator 16 attached to a capstan motor 15 , and a displacing pattern generator 33 . The displacing pattern generator 33 includes counters which count the pulses Q from the frequency generator and are reset by control signals R reproduced by the control head, a still pattern generator, and an adding means which adds the output signal from the counter and the output signal from the still pattern generator. The output signal of the displacing pattern generator 33 is amplified and applied to the positionable element 21, 22 . As a result, the video head mounted on the positionable element can properly follow a recorded video track at normal tape speed or a different tape speed.
