## Description
ALKALINE PHCISPHATASE LABELED SlStOID HO1O GLUCURONIDES The present invention relates to a novel class of enzyme labeled steroid hormone glucuronides useful as tracers in enzyme immunoassays. More specifically, the present invention provides a class of tracers comprising steroid hormone glucuronides covalently attached to alkaline phosphatase and characterized by substantially possessing the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase alone and the immunological activity of steroid hormone glucuronide alone. Steroid hormones are normally synthesized from cholesterol by organisms. The principal vertebrate steroid hormones and their physiological effects are croticosteroids mineral balance, Na retention, metabolism and gluconeogenesis progesterone proliferation of the uterine mucosa secretory phase estradiol proliferation of the uterine mucosa strus and testosterone maintenance of the accessory glands of the genital tract and secondary sex characteristics. See, Karlson, Introduction to ModernBiochemistry, Academic Press, New York, New York 3rd Edition, 1971 , page 358. It is generally recognized that in humans endogenous steroid hormones are excreted in urine principally as water soluble glucuronide derivatives. See, Kellie, The Radioimmunoassay of Steroid Conjugates , J. SteroidBiochemistry, 6, page 277 C1975 . The important physiological responses elicited by steroid hormones have prompted substantial research into methods for the quantitative determination of these hormones and their glucuronide derivatives. Particular attention has been directed towards the relationship between endogenous concentrations of the so called female sex hormones estradiol, progesterone and their role in the human female menstrual cycle. A recent report suggests that determination of estradiol glucuronide levels in a sample may be an indication of ovulation and that the occurrence of ovulation may be confirmed by determining pregnanediol glucuronide levels. See, Stanczyk, et al., Direct Radioinirtiunoassay of UrinaryEstrogen and Pregnanediol Glucuronides During the MenstrualCycle , Am. J. Obstet. SynecoZ,, 137, page 443 980L. Monitoring of urinary estradiol glucuronide levels, plasma estradjol levels and serum progesterone levels has also been reported as helpful in the treatment of human infertility.See, Black, et al, An Assessment of Urinary and PlasmaSteroid Estimations for Monitoring Treatment of Anovulation With Gonadotropins , J. Obstet, Gynec. British CommonseaZ h, 81, page 667 1974 . Several radioimmunoassays for determining steroid hormone and steroid hormone glucuronide concentrations have been reported. See, Kellie, supra, page 277 van Weeman, et al, Enzyme Immunoassay of Steroid Hormones Possibilities and Pitfalls , , Steroid Biochemistry, 11, page 147 979 . 1979 . An advantage of radioimmunoassays relative to biological or chemical assays is the high degree of sensitivity obtainable with radiolabelled compounds. Steroid hormones may occur in human body fluids in concentrations ranging from picomoles per liter estradiol, early leuteal phase of menstrual cycle to 100 micromoles per liter Curinary estriol at end of pregnancy . Radioimmunoassays have the capacity to detect steroid hormones at picomole per liter concentrations, well beyond the sensitivity of biological or chemical assay systems.See, van Weeman, et al, supra page 147. Problems associated with radioimmunoassays include the use of radiolabeled compounds which require specially equipped laboratories, specially trained personnel, and expensive counting equipment. In addition, some radioisotopes also have relatively short half lives. Furthermore, waste disposal and the need for special licenses are also potential problems. See, van Weeman, et al, sv , page 147 Kohen, et al, Nonradioisotopic Homogeneous Steroid Immunoassays , J. Steroid Biochemistry, 11, page 161 1979 . Radioimmunoassays also require a significant amount of time to complete. One recently reported ligand radioimmuno assay for steroid hormone glucuronides requires a 2 1 2 hour incubation period before the radioactivity counting procedure may be commenced. See, Chatterton, et al., Radioimmunoassay of Pregnanediol Concentrations in Early Morning UrineSpecimens For Assessment Of Leuteal Function In Women ,FertiZity and Sterility, 37, pages 361 363 1982 . Labeling of steroid hormones with a gamma emitter, I125, may also reduce immunoreactivity of the steroid hormone. See, Jeaffcoate, Progress Toward The Wider Use Of Steroid Immunoassays , . Steroid Biochemistry, page 1051 1979 .Radioimmunoassays of serum steroid hormone necessarily requires repeated venipuncture of the subject and should be performed by trained medical personnel. The use of nonisotopic labeled compounds in an immunoassay system has been proposed to avoid many of the problems inherent in radioimmunoassays. Assays for steroid hormones utilizing nonradioactive labeled compounds include so called labeled ligand assays wherein determination of the steroid hormone consists of measuring the biological optical, or chemical activity of fluorophores, bacteriophages, coenzymes or enzymes. See, van Weeman, et al, supers, page 147. Assays utilizing enzyme activity to quantify steroid hormones, commonly referred to as enzyme immunoassays or enzyme linked immunoassays, have been reported for estrogens, progesterone, testosterone and cortisol. Recently developed steroid hormone enzyme immunoassays exhibit sensitivities equal or near to those of radioimmunoassays. See, Numazawa, et al, Picogram Order EnzymeImmunoassay of Oestradiol , FEBS Letter, 79, pages 396 397, 1977 Bosch, et al, Enzyme Immunoassays For Total OestrogensIn Pregnancy Plasma Or Serum , Coin. Chem. Act, 89, pages 59, 63 19791. The enzymes conjugated to steroid hormones and utilized in enzyme immunoassays include horseradish peroxidase, B D galactosidase, glucoamylase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose6 phosphatase and malate dehydrogenase, These have been attempts to prepare enzyme labeled steroid hormone glucuronides which retain both the enzymatic and the immunological activities of the starting materials.See Rajkowski, et al., The Efficiency of Different CouplingProcedures for the Linkage of Oestriol 16cr Glucuronide , Oestrone 3 Glucuronide and Pregnanediol 3a Glucuronide toFour Different Enzymes , J. Steroid Biochemiatry, 14, pages 861 865 9812. The standard procedure used to prepare steroid hormone glucuronide immunogens comprises formation of peptide bonds between the carboxylic acid group of the glucuronide, and the s aminolysine groups of enzyme amino acid.In the study, estradiol glucuronide was coupled by its glucuronide carboxylic acid function to one of four enzymes horse radish peroxidase, urease, alcohol dehydrogenase, or glucose6 phosphate dehydrogenase by each of the following methods l a carbodiiinide method using l ethyl 3 C3 dintethylamino propylicarbodiimide SCL Q a carbodiimide method using l cycloheeyl 3 3 2 morpholinoethyl .carbodiimidemethyl to luenesulphonate 3 the Erlanger mixed anhydride method and 4 the hydroxysuccinimide N,N dicyclohe 4 carbodiimide method.Molar ratios of 3 or 20 estradiol glucuronide to 1 of enzyme were utilized. Only the mixed ankydride method produced an enzyme labelled product which retained any measurable enzyme activity. Subsequent attempts were made using the mixed anhydride method to couple preganediol glucuronide, estradiol glucuronide, and estriol glucuronide to each of the four previously mentioned enzymes. The reported results indicated that glucose 6 phosphatase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and urease all suffered heavy losses of their specific enzymatic activity. Only horseradish peroxidase retained more than 50 of its enzymatic activity when coupled with each of the three glucuronides. See, Rajkowski, et al, supra, pages 861 865.Problems are associated with the use of horseradish peroxidase as an enzyme label, include loss of enzymatic activity upon exposure to light, air or moisture, Horseradish peroxidase also must be stored in liquid form, thus, increasing problems of contamination and decreasing shelf life. Although alkaline phosphatase is noted for high stability and has been cozmnercially used as an antibody label in immunoassay systems, no enzyme labeled compounds have been reported in which alkaline phosphatase has been covalently attached to steroid hormone glucuronides, See,McComb, et al, Alkaline Phosphatase, Plenum Press, New York,New York, 1979ss. One explanation is the report of nearly total loss of alkaline phosphatase s enzymatic activity when labeled with other small molecular weight compoundsSee, Guedson, The Use of Avidin Biotin Interaction in Immunoenzymatic Techniques , J.Eistochem. Cytochem, 22, page 1131, 19791. Another explanation may be that the conventional methods of coupling alkaline phosphatase to steroid hormone glucuronides produce extensive cross linking of the enzyme to itself between carobyxlic acid and amine side groups of the enzymets amino acids, resutling in deactivation of the enzyme. It is an object of the present invention to provide a class of enzyme labeled steroid hormone glucuronides which are both enzymatically and immunologically stable.Summary Of The Invention The present invention provides a class of novel enzyme labeled steroid hormone glucuronides useful as tracers in enzyme immunoassays and methods for preparing such glucuronides. More specifically, the present invention provides a class of alkaline phosphase labeled steroid hormone glucuronide tracers comprising a steroid hormone glucuronide covalently bound to alkaline phosphatase, characterized by substantially possessing the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase alone and the immunological activity of the steroid hormone alone The present invention provides a novel method for preparing alkaline phosphatase labeled glucuronide tracers through esterification of a steroid hormone gluv curonide and subsequent formation of amide bonds between the esterified steroid hormone glucuronide and alkaline phosphatase. Detailed Description Of The Invention The tracers of the present invention are characterized in that the free carboxyl group cf a steroid hormone gluuronide is esterified to form a activated steroid hormone glucuronide ester and the activated ester is treated with alkaline phos phatase so as to form an amide bond between the amine group of alkaline phosphatase and the carboxyl group of the steroid hormone glucuronides. Preferred tracers according to the invention include preganediol alucuronide, estradiol glucuronide, estriol glucuronide, or esterone glucuronide covalently bound to alkaline phosphatase as described above. According to a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, an N hydroxysuccinimide ester of pregnanediol glucuronide is prepared by mixing pregnanediol glucuonide with N hydroxysuccinimide in the presence of l ethyl 3t3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride in dimethyl forman ide, The pregnanediol glucuronide ester thus prepared is reacted with alkaline phosphatase in an appropriate buffer at molar ratios of glucuronide to alkaline phosphatase in the range of from about 500 1 to about 10Q 1, preferably from 2G0 1 to 100 1. The alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide produce is purified by gel chromatography or dialysis. Other alkaline phosphatase labeled glucuronides may be prepared by utilizing other glucuronides such as for example, estradiol glucuronide, estriol glucuronide or esterone glucuronide, in lieu of pregnanediol glucuronide in the above described procedure. The reagents and materials employed in the methods of the present invention are generally commercially available or readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. Although alkaline phosphatase may be used as commerically supplied, if the alkaline phosphatase contains significant amounts of ammonium ions, it is preferred that the alkaline phosphatase be purified prior to use in the preparation of the tracers of the present invention. One method for purifying the alkaline phosphaXtase involves passing the alkaline phosphatase over an ACA 44 L7SB column 3 X 57 cm using 0.2 M Na2C03 9.4 , 0.2 mM, MsC12, and 0.1 deoxycholic acid, and assaying the fractions pooled and concentrated in an Amicon B1S minicon.Crude alkaline phosphatase labeled steroid hormone glucuronides were purified in the following examples using minicolumns by loading 50 t of the crude product on a Bio Gel P2 gel BIO RAD, 100 200 mesh, 2 ml packed in a polypropyleneEcono Column BIO RAD, eluting the column with a bluffer consisting of 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.lmM MgC12 and 0.1 deoxycholic acid pH 7.0 600 u , discarding the wash, and and eluting the purified alkaline phosphatase labeled steroid hormone glucuronide with an additional 400 uE of the buffer.The progress of active ester formation was monitored by thin layer chromatography employing silica gel plates Merck 60 F 254 and CH2C12 to methanol ratios of either 9 1 or 8 2, the chromatograms sprayed with a mixture of cerric ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid and then charred. As previously mentioned, the above noted tracers are useful as reagents in enzyme immunoassays and may be provided in dry powder form or in aqueous solution. The following examples serve to illustrate the present invention and are not intended to be limitations on the disclosed invention.

The crude product was purified over minicolumns to yield an alkaline phosphatase labeled estradiol glucuronide tracer. EXAMPLE 2 A mixture comprising pregnanediol gluruconide 100 mg, 200 umol N hydroxysuccinimide 30 mg, 260 umol , l hydroxybenztriazole hydratetO.l mg, 0.75 umol , andN,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 57 mg, 276 umol was stirred in 1 ml of dry dimethylformamide for one hour at 5 C, allowed to stand at room temperature for 18 hours, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure to yield a residue.The residue was dissolved in dry acetone, precipitated with ether, and the precipitate collected on a filter and dried to yield a pregnanediol glucuronide active ester as a white powder. 3.2 mg of the pregnanediol glucuronide active ester was dissolved in 200 iii of dry dimethyl formamide. Portions of the resulting solution in molar ratios of 120 1, 145 1, and 165 1 of active ester to alkaline phosphatase were mixed with 50 pt of purified alkaline phosphatase and shaken for 18 hours at 40 C to yield a crude product. The crude product was purified over minicolumns to yield an alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide tracer. EXAMPLE 3 Pregnanediol glucuronide esters were formed and reacted in situ with alkaline phosphatase to form tracer preparations as follows Pregnanediol glucuronide 25.0 mg, 50 mol , N hydroxysuccinimide 8.5 mg, 74 vmol , and 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride 8.5 mg, 45 vmol were stirred in 1 ml of dry dimethylformamide for 24 hours.A portion of the solution having a molar ratio of 490 1 of active ester to alkaline phosphatase was reacted with 400 pt of purified alkaline phosphatase to yield a crude product which was purified over 25 minicolumns and dialyzed against buffer consisting of 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 deoxycholic acid pH 7.0 2 x 500 ml to yield an alkaline phosphatase labeled pregnanediol glucuronide tracer. As previously mentioned, the alkaline phosphatase labeled steroid hormone glucuronides of the present invention are useful as tracers in enzyme immunoassays. The following examples serve to illustrate the use of tracers in enzyme immunoassays.
