## Description
The present invention concerns a method and means for the prevention and control of bacterial diseases in plants. Plant diseases caused by bacteria are spread worldwide, attacking numerous crops and causing significant economic damage. Bacterial spot disease caused by Severe and widespread cases of bacterial diseases are often caused for the following reasons So far prevention or control of bacterial plant diseases by chemical means has provided only a partial solution of the problem. Known treatments against bacterial pathogens in plant can be divided into two categories. Various antibiotic products have high activity against bacterial plant pathogens but this group of products is usually forbidden for agricultural use. It has also been reported that copper compounds may be combined with other antibacterial agents such as antibiotics for the prevention and control of bacterial diseases, but the activity established in this way was mostly additive. Apart from the fact that this effect was to be expected it has, as far as antibiotics are concerned, the above shortcoming that antibiotics are forbidden for use in agriculture. 5 Ethoxy 3 trichloromethyl 1,2,4 thiadiazole, also known under its generic name etridiazole, is a known compound which is described, for example, in U.S. patents, 3,260,688 and 3,260,725. It is known to be a fungicide that is mostly used against fungi of the It has further been found that etridiazole is active against the soil bacteria In accordance with the present invention it has surprisingly been found that when etridiazole and a copper compound are combined with each other, there occurs a synergistic effect between them resulting in an antibacterial composition suitable for the prevention and control of bacterial diseases in plants. This discovery was completely surprising and could not have been anticipated in any way from the prior art which teaches that etridiazole has no antibacterial activity other than against nitrozomonas and nitrobacter bacteria, and that any enhancement of the antibacterial properties of copper compounds was only on a purely additive basis. In the following specification and claims the compound 5 ethoxy 3 trichloromethyl 1,2,4 thiadiazole will be referred to by its generic name etridiazole. Also, whenever the term copper is used in the context of a composition, it refers to the copper atom or copper cation moiety of a copper compound. In accordance with the present invention there is provided an antibacterial composition comprising at least one copper compound and etridiazole. Any suitable copper compound can be used, e.g. a salt such as copper acetate, copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, copper sulfate and many others. The compositions according to the invention can be in form of wettable powderous or liquid concentrates which in addition to the active ingredients may also contain a solid carrier substance in case of a powder, e.g.silica, caolin, etc. a solvent in case of a liquid concentrate such as various aromatic solvents, e.g. kerosene, xylene, toluene, acetone, etc. Such concentrates may also contain additives such as emulsifiers, stabilizers and the like. The compositions according to the invention may also be in form of dusting powder. In addition to their novel and unexpected antibacterial effect the compositions according to the invention may also exert the known antifungal effect of etridiazole and they may thus be used for combined antibacterial and antifungal treatments. Hereinafter the various beneficial effects obtainable by means of compositions according to the invention will at times be referred to indiscriminately as antipathogenic effect. For enhancement of the antipathogenic effect compositions according to the invention may include additives such as, for example, acid, surfactants and pentachloronitrobenzene PCNB . Where the copper compound in a composition according to the invention is a salt of a salt forming acid the composition may also comprise said salt forming acid in free acid form. For example, when the copper compound is copper acetate or copper citrate the composition may comprise free acetic acid or citric acid respectively. The antibacterial compositions according to the invention can be used for the disinfection of seeds and the treatment of plant foliage. In either case the treatment may be with a liquid composition or a dusting powder which composition of powder contains copper compound and etridiazole in effective amounts that produce the desired antipathogenic synergistic effect while not being phytotoxic to the treated plants. Where a liquid composition is used it may be prepared in situ by dilution of a powderous or liquid concentrate with a suitable amount of water. Dusting powders will usually be readily available with the desired concentration of copper compound and etridiazole without need for further dilution, but may also appear as a concentrate that needs dilution with inert powder. The invention thus also provides a method for the prevention and control of bacterial plant diseases wherein seeds are treated with an antibacterial composition comprising a copper compound in an amount corresponding to at least 0.04 by weight of copper and etridiazole in an amount of at least 0.015 by weight. The invention further provides a method for the prevention and control of bacterial plant diseases where plant foliage is treated with an antibacterial composition comprising a copper compound in an amount corresponding to at least 0.03 by weight of copper and etridiazole in an amount of at least 0.2 by weight. For both the treatment of seeds and plant foliage liquid compositions or dusting powder may be used. In either case the composition may comprise an additive for enhancing the antipathogenic effect, e.g. a member of the group of acids, surfactants and pentachloronitrobenzene. Where in practicing the methods of this invention a composition is used in which the copper compound is a salt with a salt forming acid, such composition may also comprise said salt forming acid in free acid form. The invention will now be described by means of a number of trials which demonstrate the novel and unexpected antibacterial properties of a mixture of etridiazole and a copper compound. This study was divided into three parts 1. Preliminary trials. 2. Seed disinfection trials against bacterial diseases. 3. Phytotoxic trials. Preliminary trials to examine the efficacy of etridiazole against bacterial pathogens were carried out with the commercial etridiazole product Terrazole trade mark . Later on, trials were carried out with the commercial product Terra coat trade mark which contains etridiazole and PCNB pentachloronitrobenzene and is destined for seed disinfection against fungal diseases. In addition, trials were conducted to study possible phytotoxic effects. The products were used alone and in mixtures containing different ratios of etridiazole, cupric acetate and acetic acid. Trials for checking the efficacy of chemical treatments against bacterial disease pathogens were carried out on naturally infected seeds, or on seeds artificially infected with suspension of the bacteria. In cases where the seeds were artificially infected, the seeds were dipped for a couple of minutes in suspensions of bacteria which were grown in suitable conditions. The suspensions with the seeds were incubated in vacuum for 15 minutes, and then the seeds were dried and ready for trials. In all trials, seed disinfection was carried out by dipping the seeds in different chemical solutions. The variable factors were The efficacy of the disinfection was examined in a number of ways In this method, live bacterial pathogens that survived the seed disinfection, were counted. Treated seeds were dried by vaporization. Five grams of dried seeds from each treatment were ground in a grinder of 20 mesh and transferred to a solution containing 0.1 agar in water and were shaken for 30 minutes. From each sample, 10x dilutions were prepared. From each of the various dilutions, 0.1 ml was taken and placed in a suitable medium in a petri dish, with a Drigalski stick. After 4 days of incubation at temperature of 27 C, colonies of the bacterial pathogens were counted in each petri dish. The number of live bacteria in each diluted solution was calculated to give the number of live pathogens in one gram of treated seeds. This method is essentially similar to the previous one. In the MPN system, the number of pathogenic bacteria in one gram of seeds is statistically calculated when only one species of bacteria is present. In this method, the efficacy of the disinfection is examined by a bioassay. After seed disinfection, the seeds are dried and sown in the soil, and kept in a humid cell with suitable temperature. The efficacy of the treatment is determined by the level of infestation in the seedlings. The efficacy of a number of products by a direct contact with the bacteria was checked as follows Preparation of solutions of different concentrations of the examined products. Soaked bacteria suspension in the solutions for a period of 10 minutes. Filtration of the solution containing bacteria through milipore disc, so that the bacteria are concentrated on the disc. Rinsing the disc with distilled water. Placing the disc in a measured amount of water with 0.1 agar, and shaking the disc in this solution in order to transfer the bacteria from the disc to the solution. Making 10x dilutions and direct placing on suitable medium see section F1 above . Phytotoxicity studies were made by disinfecting the seeds in the different treatments at different temperatures and periods of time and then sowing them in soil. The time and percent of emergence, and seedling development up to age of 3 4 true leaves, were evaluated. In some preliminary trials, cupric acetate, acetic acid and etridiazole in Terra coat, trade mark were examined alone and in mixtures containing different proportions, against four bacteria pathogens In this trial, 11 concentrations of cupric acetate in aqueous solution were checked, from 0.001 0.8 by weight. Six concentrations of acetic acid from 0.0001N to 0.5N were also examined. All treatments were checked against the four species of bacteria mentioned. Increase of the copper concentration in the solution improved the efficacy of the solution, but even at the high concentration of 0.8 cupric acetate there was not absolute control of bacteria and in each case of the four species of bacteria that were examined, about 10³ bacteria per cm² of water remained alive. Acetic acid was found to have low efficacy against the examined bacteria and even at concentration of 0.5N, a level of 10⁴ bacteria per cm² of water was found alive after treatment. This trial then shows that copper has a certain, though unsatisfactory antibacterial effect. Nineteen concentrations of etridiazole in form of Terra coat trade mark from 50 ppm to 2000 ppm in aqueous solution were examined. The level of bacteria in the untreated control solutions of the four bacteria species was about 1 x 10⁷ bacteria cm² while zole 2000 ppm a level of 10⁶ live bacteria cm² was found. Efficacy of etridiazole against bacteria was very low, in this trial. This trial then confirms that etridiazole has practically no antibacterial effect. In this trial, combinations of cupric acetate and acetic acid in a mixture, were evaluated 24 treatments . Eight concentrations of cupric acetate from 0.02 to 0.8 were examined with four concentrations of acetic acid 0.001N 0.05N . A mixture that contained high concentrations of cupric acetate and acetic acid was slightly more effective than each one of the products alone, but there was still an uncontrolled level of 10² live bacteria cm² water. There were no differences in the sensitivity of the four species of bacteria. In this trial, combinations of different mixtures that contained 9 concentrations of etridiazole, from 10 ppm to 500 ppm 6 concentrations of cupric acetate, from 0.08 to 0.8 and 4 concentrations of acetic acid, from 0.001N to 0.05N, were evaluated a total of 18 treatments . The surfactant Triton X100 trade mark , was added to all the treatments in an amount of one drop to each half liter. Results are presented in Table I and they clearly demonstrated the synergistic antibacterial effect of copper and etridiazole. The following are results of seed disinfection trials in some crops This trial was carried out in pepper seeds Var.Maor, naturally infected by One can see from the results in Table II that the disinfection of infected pepper seeds with a mixture of etridiazole and cupric acetate resulted in complete control of the examined bacteria, in comparison with only partial control of the bacteria by each of the individual components alone. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate commercially the efficacy of the mixture that was already examined in Trial 5 in disinfecting pepper seeds either infested with The results in Table IV are actually an advanced stage of trials whose results are presented in Table III. It can be seen that seeds that were disinfected by the mixture gave healthy plants which produced uninfested seeds. Infested seeds that were not treated by the mixture gave plants that carried the bacterial pathogens and produced infested seeds. In tomatoes, disinfection trials were carried out against two bacterial diseases. Most of the work was done in order to examine the efficacy of the mixtures in controlling bacterial specic of tomato caused by In the trial that was carried out against bacterial specic of tomato, various concentrations of cupric acetate, etridiazole and combinations of both of them, were evaluated. Also, different dipping times and temperatures were checked. Efficacy of disinfection was evaluated by assessing the disease appearance in the seedlings which was caused by infection of the treated seeds. Results are presented in Table V. From the results in Table V, it is evident that etridiazole had very low activity at the examined concentrations without any significant effect of the dipping time and the temperature. Treatment with cupric acetate was more effective but still insufficient. With this treatment disinfection at 40 C gave better results than at 25 C while the dipping time made no difference. Mixtures containing etridiazole and cupric acetate with the addition of acetic acid and surfactant were very effective in seeds disinfection. In this treatment, a long dipping time and high temperatures improved the disinfection process. The efficacy of the mixture in disinfecting seeds infected with pith rot caused by Trials were carried out in seeds of cabbage and cauliflower infested with The efficacy of the disinfection process was checked in a bio assay system. Results are presented in Table VI. From the results in Table VI it appears that etridiazole at various concentrations was not effective in disinfecting the seeds. The changing conditions of temperatures or dipping times did not affect these results. The activity of cupric acetate was low to moderate and it changed with the trial conditions. Dipping the seeds at 40 C gave better results than in 25 C. Dipping the seeds for 20 minutes gave better results than 10 minutes, but at any case cupric acetate did not provide more than 38 disease control. Disinfection of seeds in a mixture containing cupric acetate etridiazole was very effective in decreasing the black rot disease and was better than with either of the individual products. There were no differences among mixtures that contained different amounts of the chemicals. Combination of the high temperature 40 C and dipping time for 20 minutes gave the best results 92 control in comparison with the untreated seeds. In other trials, large amounts of infected seeds of cauliflower were disinfected by dipping them in the above mixture, and then sown in the field or in a greenhouse. In all cases, the mixture that contained etridiazole 0.025 cupric acetate 0.1 acetic acid 0.005N, was very effective and prevented appearance of the disease on the seedlings. Experiments were carried out in order to find an effective control of bacterial strip of wheat caused by In this trial the efficacy of the products in disinfecting wheat seeds was tested at various periods of time from 5 to 60 minutes. Disinfected seeds were compared with seeds treated with water check and with seeds that were defined in laboratory as seeds clean from the pathogen. Efficacy of the treatments was measured by counting the amount of bacteria that remained alive in the seeds. The trial was carried out in five replicates. Results are presented in Table VII. From Table VII it is apparent that etridiazole was not effective in decreasing the level of seed infection. Disinfecting the seeds with cupric acetate was significantly more effective, and was improved when the dipping time was longer and at 20 minutes. Under these conditions there was 94 control in comparison with the untreated seeds. Dipping time of more than 20 minutes even 60 minutes did not improve the control. Disinfecting the infected wheat seeds with the mixture was significantly more effective than any other treatment and afforded a control of over 99.9 after a dipping time of 10 minutes. Disinfecting the seeds with this mixture by dipping more than 10 minutes gave a complete control of the bacteria. In this trial, carried out at four replicates, the disinfection efficacy of the mixture was tested, as in Trial 10, in infected and uninfected seeds. After treatment, the seeds were sown in light soil and put in a fog chamber at 20 C. The percent of seedling emergence and the disease incidence in them, were checked. Results are presented in Table VIII. From Table VIII it is apparent that the disinfection of infected wheat seeds was very efficient. It is difficult to know if the disease that appeared in the disinfected seeds about eight days after it had appeared in undisinfected seeds, was a result of a primary infection in the seeds, or a result of a secondary infection from neighbouring infected plants in treatment 3. Also in plants from uninfected not disinfected seeds treatment 1 , the disease appeared eight days later than in treatment 3 but in a very low level. The mixture does not appear to have any negative effect on emergence and development of the seedlings. Phytotoxicity trials were carried out by dipping the seeds in solutions that contained various concentrations of mixture compounds. Thirty six treatments with four concentrations of Terra coat SD 205 trade mark from 150 ppm to 1,000 ppm , cupric acetate 0.1 plus acetic acid 0.005N and various combinations of these chemicals were evaluated. Disinfections were carried out either at room temperature or at 40 C and at two dipping times of 10 to 20 minutes. Treatments were compared with undisinfected seeds dipped in water. In cauliflower Percent of seedling emergence in the check treatment was about 70 . Terra coat alone did not cause any inhibition or damage to the seedling emergence. Treatment with cupric acetate slightly lowered the level of seedling emergence, and so did the combinations of Terra coat and cupric acetate. Time of dipping had little effect, and the effect of temperature was negligible. There were no differences in the development of the seedlings in the treatments. In tomatoes the percent of emergence in all treatments including check treatment was 91 . There were no negative effects of the various treatments on the emergence and development of the tomato seedlings. In pepper There were no signs of damage on the plants. Inpeppers, many field trials were also carried out in which no negative effects were found of Terra coat trade mark or copper alone, or of combinations of the two. This study was divided into two parts 1. Foliage sprayings against bacterial diseases in order to evaluate the efficacy of different solutions in preventing or controlling bacterial diseases, and 2. Phytotoxicity trials. Trials were carried out in tomatoes, peppers and cauliflower. Most of the trials were carried out under controlled conditions in the greenhouse and others in the open field. The trials were carried out against bacterial diseases in the following crops In trials that were carried out in the greenhouse, plants at age of 3 5 leaves that were grown in speedling system , were used. Plants were allowed to grow in the original trays without contact between them. About 48 hours before the infection, the bacterial pathogen was transferred for multiplication to a suitable growth medium see materials and methods of para I hereinbefore at optimal temperature until all the medium was covered by bacteria. Then a suspension of bacteria at concentration of 1 x 10⁶ 1 x 10⁷ per cm² was prepared. The bacterial suspension was sprayed to runoff with a hand sprayer on to the leaves of the test plants. Spraying was made on dry leaves with the addition of carborundum to the spray solution in order to ensure better infection. In trials where the efficacy of the treatments was evaluated in preventative treatments, the application was given a few hours before the bacterial infection. In the preventative treatments, the products were applied a few hours before the bacterial infection. In the curative treatments, the application was carried out 20 hours after bacterial infection. After application, when plants dried out they were transferred to a fog chamber with controlled conditions. In trials that were carried out in the greenhouse, the plants were transferred after the application and infection, to control conditions of fogginess and suitable temperatures for bacteria, till the end of the trial. Infection was evaluated in the seedlings according to the following key 0 healthy seedling, without symptoms of disease, 5 complete coverage of the seedling with spots of disease, or dead seedling. The intermediate degrees were given according to the severity of the disease in the leaves. As already mentioned, this study was divided into two parts 1 Foliage sprayings against bacterial diseases. 2 Phytotoxicity tests. In tomatoes, several trials were carried out in greenhouse under conditions of fog chamber and artificial infection in order to evaluate the efficacy of Terrazole trade mark and copper, in different rates and combinations, in preventing and controlling bacterial diseases specic of tomato caused by In one trial, various treatments were examined in prevention of disease, as appears in Table IX. Table IX shows that etridiazole alone was not effective at the tested concentrations. Kocide 101 trade mark was were moderately effective in preventing the bacterial specic disease, being slightly more effective than cupric acetate. Combinations of Terrazole trade mark with cupric acetate or Kocide 101 trade mark were very effective. There were no differences between the two types of copper products, in their contribution to the performance of the combination. In another trial, additional combinations of etridiazole and copper were tested in order to determine the best treatment. Results are presented in Table X. From the results in Table X it appears that all the products that were individually sprayed namely, etridiazole, cupric hydroxide and cupric acetate, had a very moderate and similar efficacy in preventing bacterial specic of tomatoes. Combinations of etridiazole with each of the copper products, was significantly more effective in preventing the disease appearance. There were no differences between the efficacy of the copper products in the mixture. Regarding the rates it seems that the high concentration of the copper hydroxide Kocide 101, trade mark in the mixture 0.5 caused a decrease in the mixture efficacy in comparison with concentration of 0.3 . On the other hand, increasing the concentration of etridiazole in the mixture from 0.2 to 0.4 slightly improved the mixture efficacy. In winter of 1982 83, two field trials were carried out in tomatoes, in which the efficacy of several products was evaluated against bacterial specic disease of tomatoes under different levels of field infestation. The following are results of a trial conducted when infestation was at a stage of beginning. Seven weekly applications were given Table XI Table XI shows that etridiazole did not prevent bacterial specic disease. Copper hydroxide was significantly more effective. There was no difference between the two examined concentrations of copper hydroxide. Combination of etridiazole and copper hydroxide was the most efficient treatment and differed significantly from all other treatments. Etridiazole concentrations of 0.2 and 0.4 in the mixture had the same activity while copper hydroxide as Kocide 101 trade mark at concentration of 0.15 in the mixture was less effective than of 0.3 . Some trials were carried out in the greenhouse on pepper by the same method as on tomatoes. The results of two of the trials conducted as prevention treatment are given in the following Tables XII and XIII. From the results in Table XII and XIII, it is apparent that etridiazole was almost not effective in preventing bacterial spot disease in pepper. Copper hydroxide Kocide 101, trade mark was prominently more effective than the other treatments where Terrazole trade mark 0.4 Kocide 101 trade mark 0.3 was the most effective mixture against bacterial spot in pepper. In cauliflower, a trial was conducted in order to test the efficacy of the above products in preventing the black rot caused by Table XIV shows that Terrazole trade mark and Kocide 101 trade mark alone had very low activity against black rot in cauliflower, while the mixture was more effective. Phytotoxic studies were carried out in cauliflower, pepper and tomato. In these trials etridiazole in form of Terrazole trade mark was examined in series of concentrations up to 0.5 , cupric hydroxide in form of Kocide 101 trade mark up to 0.5 and cupric acetate up to 0.2 . Combinations of those products were also checked. Application was by spraying on seedlings of the above crops till runoff. In pepper and tomato there were no phytotoxic signs on the seedlings. In cauliflower, phytotoxic signs appeared on plants which were sprayed with Terrazole trade mark at concentration of 0.3 and higher.
