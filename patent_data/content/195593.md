# Method and apparatus for purification of high nitrogen content gas.

## Abstract
Nitrogen and methane are separated in a nitrogen methane cryogenic fractionator 76 , operating at a tempera ture between the boiling points of nitrogen and methane. A distillative aid or absorbent 88 is injected into the nitrogen methane cryogenic fractionator for enhancing separation, for enabling an increase in operating pressure, and for enabling a high separation rate at relatively high temperatures.
