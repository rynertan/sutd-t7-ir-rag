# Color image display apparatus.

## Abstract
The video image display apparatus of flat tube type comprising a phosphor screen, an electron beam source having a predetermined number 15 of line cathodes for inturn emit ting said predetermined number of horizontal rows of elec tron beams, each row having a second predetermined num ber 320 of rod shaped electron beams for together produc ing one horizontal line of image on said phosphor screen, a horizontal deflection means for horizontally deflec tion of the electron beams to selectively emit red, green or blue phosphor stripes, a vertical deflection means for vertical deflections of the electron beams of the horizontal rows, thereby to verti cally move one of the horizontal line in the vertically divided segment, wherein red, green and blue color signals are time sequentially sampled by sets of three sampling signals of time sequential relation, and the sampled color signals are impressed on the horizontal deflection means, and thereby, hitherto poor horizontal resolution is much improved as if the sampling frequency is raised 3 times high.
