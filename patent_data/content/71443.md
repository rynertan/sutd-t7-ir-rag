# Device for waste water treatment.

## Abstract
An apparatus for the removal of a significant proportion of one or more metal contaminants from waste water comprises an electrolytic cell 10 having a plurality of anodes 16 and cathodes 17 preferably in an alternating arrangement. Each anode 16 has openings, such as perfor ations or open interconnected pores, to permit the waste water to flow through. Each cathode 17 is a reticulated structure, such as a metallized open cell organic polymeric foam substrate which has been metallized first electrolessly and then electrolytically. In a particular form of the appar atus, the anodes 16 are also made of metallized open cell organic polymeric foam substrates.
