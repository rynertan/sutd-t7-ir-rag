## Description
INTERACTIVE CHINESE TYPEWRITER The present invention relates to language information processing and communication. More particularly, the present invention relates to non English alphabet languages e.g., Chinese, Korean and Japanese information processing, such as typewriting. Chinese, as a written form of communication, presents a major burden to efficient and rapid communications.Current communications technology relative to the writtenChinese language is confounded both at the point where the person meets the machine and at the point where the machine presents its output. Chinese writings in the current square Han characters ideographs used to represent words and ideas have followed a pattern of development that has led to the development of over 50,000Chinese characters. A traditional Chinese character is hand written with brush and ink as a combination of various calligraphy strokes to create the character. An educated person inChina is still measured by the number of characters he has mastered. Calligraphy is still widely popular and intensely followed as an art form in China. But to become basically literate and to read and write the characters, let along master the language, is a long and laborious process. To be newspaper literate one must know at least 2,000 characters to be college educated, 5,000.For a variety of business uses, between 8,000 and 10,000 characters are required, which is about the number of characters in a good dictionary. One such dictionary is the Pinyin Chinese English Dictionary, published by theCommercial Press Limited of Hong Kong, 1979 Library ofCongress Cataloging in Progress Number 79 2477 .Because of this very large number of characters, Chinese typewriting, typesetting and the like, are rendered extremely complicated, expensive and time consuming. With the advent of computer technology, a special problem is presented how do you take a language with 50,000 characters and make it compatible with a conventional computer keyboard having a limited number of keys. As a result of the need to provide a high speed way to handle written communications in the Chinese language, there has been an ongoing activity in the pror art in developing various keyboard arrangements and coding schemes that provide for use of computer based information processing of ideographc languages. Each of these prior art data processing systems have attempted to provide approaches that will accomplish the unique identifcation of an individual Chinese character with a minimum of keyboard entries, and where the keyboard entry is simple enough to enable an operator or typist to create the ideograph text at high speeds. The prior art techniques may be classifed into various methods of encoding the unique identification of aChinese character to be printed. One such method was to develop a Standard Telegraphic Code for the character.This code was developed to transmit characters by means of a four digit number or three letter code. This respectively produced 10,000 or 17,576 characters. The Chinese telegraph code facilitated long distance communications, but looking up the code number of each character was a tedious and inefficient process. Another method practiced in the prior art is the stroke sequence recogniton method demonstrated by the Graphic Art Research Foundation, Inc. GARF Chinese typewriter in which a keyboard of 21 keys are used to encode 21 basic individual calligraphy strokes used to draw Chinese characters. The GARF typewriter does not construct the ideograph stroke by stroke, as is the case in the formation of words, letter by letter, on anEnglish language typewriter. Rather, the keys on the GARF typewriter generate an electronic code for each stroke or entry, which, when combined in a particular sequence, gives the electronic address code for the complete ideograph character. The ideographs are stored separately in the machine and are accessed by their particular electronic address codes. Another approach by the prior art has been to use extremely large keyboard entries for identifying theChinese characters, for example, the IBM 5255 34. A keyboard having more than 2,000 characters uniquely identified on individual keys is provided. Each key in the keyboard has 12 characters on it, and at the side there is an additional 12 digit keyboard. If the operator presses key number 12, for example, then selects a key on the large keyboard, the 12th character on that key is displayed. Another example of the large keyboard entry is the CCRT model 280. More sophisticated approaches to encoding information into a computer for uniquely identifying a Chinese character have also been attempted by the prior art. These encoding methods are generally described as corner coding methods, such as the single corner Global IntegrationTechnology GIT unit , three corner Wang IdeographicWord Processor IWP or four corner approaches theCornell University approach . The corners here referred to are the corners of the square Han characters which comprise each ideograph. Corner encoding refers to a method of assigning numeric or alphabetic codes to a set of shapes that occur at the corners of characters. For each of these corner coding process machines, the coding process begins with the analysis of a character s fundamental symbols through the principal of corner coding and the principal of shape coding. In the three corner coding method, only three corners of a character are used in the conversion of the ideograph to its equivalent code. Symbols in the three corners are matched with fundamental symbols, yielding a code number consisting of three sets of two digits. For each of these corner coding methods, the lack of speed has been a major drawback of Chinese data entry.Another disadvantage to the corner coding method is the inability to uniquely identify each of the characters in the set of encoded and stored characters. To uniquely identify a given character, a two step process must some times be used to isolate the desired character. The first step involves looking up all the characters described by a partcular code. In an electronic word process, all the characters meeting a particular shape description are displayed on the CRT. The operator then implements the second step whch consists of picking the desired character out of the displayed list for insertion in text. In each of the above described prior art approaches to data processing of Chinese characters, the problem of uniquely dentifying each individual character with a minimum of keyboard entry to achieve high speed character identification has not been possible. The present invention solved the problems of the prior art to achieve the unique identification of Chinese characters through a minimum of keyboard entries to obtain a high speed Chinese language typewriter through a different and more efficient encoding approach. In one embodiment of the invention, the methodology of the present invention is derived from a standard Chinese English dictionary, such as the one identified above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, an interactive Chinese typewriting system is disclosed for uniquely identifying, from among a plurality of encoded characters, a Chinese character to be printed. Each character encoded is encoded according to the character s radical number, the number of calligraphy strokes in addition to the radical required to construct the character and a number representing the character to be printed according to its position in a table of all of the encoded characters having the same radical and number of additonal calligraphy strokes. The typewriting system includes a standard computer terminal keyboard entry, a CRT for displaying theChinese characters identified and a dot matrix printer for printing the identified characters. In one aspect of the invention, a method for identifying the encoded characters is disclosed in which a code word representative of the radical number of the character to be printed, a code word representative of the number of additional calligraphy strokes in the character and the code word for the position of the character in a table of all of the encoded characters having a given radical and number of calligraphy strokes are generated. As a last step, the character to be printed is selected from among the plurality of encoded characters according to the generated radical, stroke and character code words. The step of generating a code word representative of the character according to its position in a table of characters may include the steps of displaying in the CRT display an array of all of the characters encoded for the characters having the given radical and stroke code words previously generated for the desired character to be printed. The character to be printed is then selected from among the display characters by pressing a corresponding key in an array of keys of the keyboard where the array of keys of the keyboard is equal to the array of the display characters, one key corresponding to one character position in the displayed array. In another aspect of the invention, the table of all of the encoded characters having the same radical and stroke number code words is ordered according to the frequency of use of the characters in Chinese text. The step of generating a code word representative of the character to be printed according to its position in a table so ordered includes the steps of depressing a first specific key to select the character in the table having the highest frequency of use. This character is then displayed. If this displayed character is not the desired character, then the first specific key is depressed again to display the next most frequently used character. This process is continued until the desired character is being displayed. A second specific key is then struck to select the displayed character and to begin the selection process for the next character. In another aspect of the invention, a typewriting system including a microprocessor programmed to select the character to be printed in response to input from an operator is disclosed. The typewriting system also includes a mass storage device for storing the encodedChinese characters according to the radical, stroke and character number. The processor keyboard entry contains a plurality of keys for generating the code words to identify the radical, stroke and character number of the character to be printed. Certain ones of the keys identifying selected ones of the radicals and certain other ones of the keys identifing individual characters which most frequently occur in Chinese text. When a respective radical key or character key is struck, the microprocessor automatically generates the correct code word for the radical, and the code words for the radical, stroke and character number. When a character is identified, a dot matrix display of the character is presented in the CRT display means. The characters as selected are displayed in the CRT in an array or sequence of character positions to create a document which will be printed. The characters displayed are then printed by a dot matrix printer under control of the microprocessor and the operator. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a fuller understanding of the invention, reference can be made to the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which, FIGURE 1 is a block diagram illustration of the interactive typewriting system of the present invention FIGURE 2 is an illustration of a typical computer keyboard entry modified in accordance with the present invention for encoding the identifying codes for theChinese characters to be printed FIGURES 3 a and b together form a computer flow diagram of a portion of the programming of the present invention for selecting the next character to be printed and FIGURES 4 a and b are a computer flow diagram for the RETRIEVE CHAR subroutine as illustrated in the flow diagram of Figures 3 a and b . Similar reference numerals refer to similar parts throughout the drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION The present invention is basically derived from the presentation of Chinese characters as they appear in standard Chinese English dictionaries, for example, the Pinyin Chinese English Dictionary identified above. EachChinese character is constructed from one of over 200 basic drawings identified as radicals. Radicals are the roots of Chinese characters. To analyze the meaning of a character, one must break the character down to its roots, into radicals. From the radical, a character can be found in the dictionary. A given radical may have many Chinese characters constructed therefrom by the addition of calligraphy strokes. The Chinese English dictionary has cataloged by radicals all of the characters which have as their root a given radical. Grouped into various tables for each of the radicals are the Chinese characters which all have the same number of additional calligraphy strokes. Thus, a given Chinese character may be found according to the radical of the character and the number of additional calligraphy strokes needed to complete the character. To complete the unique identification of a given character, the dictionary has listed in a table all of the characters having the same number of additional calligraphy strokes and the same radical for each of the groups associated with a given radical. Thus, the present invention has produced a methodology of uniquely identifying a given Chinese character by assigning a code to each radical, a stoke number code equal to the number of additional calligraphy strokes required to draw the character from its radical and a character number code which corresponds to the position of the character in a table of all of the characters having the same number of additional calligraphy strokes and the same radical. In the present invention, three code numbers are required to uniquely identify a given Chinese character. These three code numbers will have a total of seven digits.But the programmed computer 18 shortens input for these numbers by condensing input operations. The condensing of input is accomplished by assigning the high frequency used radicals to keys which, when depressed, gives the 3 digit number for that radical with one key stroke. Additionally, the space bar generates zero digits to as frequently happens fill code numbers with zeros quickly and easily. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the process of uniquely identifying a Chinese character proceeds as described above with respect to inputting a code to identify the radical and a code to identify the number of additional calligraphy strokes the R S index for the character . A different approach is taken, however, in the alternate approach with respect to the last code required to completely identify the character.In the first embodiment, the characters having the radical and number of additional calligraphy strokes R S were arranged in a list as they appear in a Chinese English dictionary. In the alternate embodiment, the characters under a given radical and number of calligraphy strokes are likewise arranged in a list, but the position of each character in the list is based on its frequency of use, i.e., the more frequently used characters are listed first, with the first character in the list the most frequently used of those characters. In this alternate embodiment, a third code to the processor 18 is also required to uniquely identify the character. This third code can be any special stroke, such as the Right Arrow key. If the Right Arrow key is struck as the third code input in a character identification routine, the computer 18 causes to appear in the text of characters 26 for the next character to be identified, the first character in the list for the characters specified by the just inputted R S codes. As mentioned previously, this character is the most frequently used of those characters. If the character displayed is not the one desired, the next most frequently used character is brought up simply by depressing the Right Arrow key again. This process may continue until the desired character appears in the text on the screen.Once the desired character is being displayed, the selection process for the character is then terminated by tapping the Space Bar. Depressing of the Space Bar clears theR S C codes and moves the cursor in the displayed text 26 to the next adjacent position for the next character input. During the selection process for this alternate embodiment, if the operator wishes to see the most frequently used character for the R S characters, he may enter the code 01 following the R and S codes. The code 0 2 after the R S codes bring up for display the second most frequently used of the R S characters, and so forth for 03, etc. Turning now to the figures and first to Figure 1, a block diagram of the interactive Chinese typewriting system 1 of the present invention is shown. Central to the operation of the data processing system is microcomputer unit 18 which responds to input data from the keyboard 28. Microcomputer 18 is programmed to retrieve from mass storage unit 12 the encoded ideographs according to the radical, stroke number and character number code words generated by the operator via the standard computer keyboard 28. Figure 2 illustrates a typical computer keyboard 28 modified according to the present invention. Still referring to Figure 1, mass storage unit 12 is shown comprised, for example, of a hard disk 14 and a floppy disk 16. While hard and floppy disks are shown for storing the encoded Chinese character, other equivalent mass storage devices could be used, such as solid stateRAMs. Each encoded Chinese character is identified according to its radical, stroke number and character number as previously described. Once identified, the digital information for generating the character, for example, as a dot matrix array, is retrieved from mass storage 12. A cathode ray tube CRT 24 is provided for displaying the characters to be printed as they are retrieved from mass storage in response to the proper code words inputted by the operator. The CRT display 24 responds to the programming of the microcomputer 18 to display the identified characters to be printed in an array on the screen of characters 26 which, for the present invention, comprises a 10 x 7 character array. When the text to be printed has been composed and is displayed in CRT 24, the operator may cause the text to be outputted into hard copy such as by printing the displayed array on dot matrix printer 10 or transmitted via a modem 20 to a remote output device 22, such as another printer, CRT, etc. In this manner, the present invention generates the desired printed text ofChinese characters.For the present invention, mass storage unit 12 stores each encoded character in the form of digital information for a 20 by 20 a 40 x 40 matrix is also possible dot matrix. For the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, keyboard means 28, CRT display 24 and microcomputer 18 comprise an Apple II Plus microprocessor system fromApple Computers. Mass storage device 12 is a Corvus Systems, Inc. 20 M byte 8 bits per byte disk storage unit, and printer 10 is an Epson MX 80. Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, microcomputer 18 responds to keyboard 24 as if it were a number of different keyboards, each with a normal default and shift level. In Figure 2, each of the keys contain four character symbols imprinted thereon. The upper left corner of each key represents the default or normal mode of the keyboard 28. The upper right hand corner of each key is the shift position the lower left representing the first escape default level and the lower right representing the first escape shift position. In the normal or default keyboard, only a single key actuation is required, while the shift level must be pushed along with another key.The keyboard levels default 0 are chosen by pushing the escape button while in a program edit mode. The input line signals the keyboard level in control 0 default, 1 7 or more are additionally available keyboards with both default and shift keys. Only levels 0 default and 1 first escape are described herein, however, the device is not limited to only these keyboards. In operation, the present invention uniquely identifies an encoded Chinese character in response to the operator s actuation of the various keys of the keyboard 28. Each encoded character is identifed by three discrete numbers corresponding to the radical, stroke number and character number for the Chinese character. For example, the sequence of numbers 174 2 2 radical stroke character represents the three discrete code numbers to identify the Chinese character. The first number 174 is the radical number. A radical is the root of a character or the primary identifier, and is a distinctive ideograph that is used as a basic part with which to build more complex characters. The radicals are an ancient and fundamental part of the Chinese written language and are frequently numbered to facilitate dictionary use.For example, radical 174 appears in the Pinyin Chinese English dictionary as the radicals. The second code number 2 is the number of calligraphy strokes in addition to the radical that appears in the character s original brush and calligraphy drawing. This is also a time honored method of distinguishing between characters. The third number 2 is the individual character s position on the list of characters defined by the first two numbers. Any character to be printed that is encoded into the system may be retrieved from mass storage 12 by typing in these three codes using the top row of numbered keys on the keyboard. While each character encoded into the system may be identified by inputting three code words to uniquely identify the character, the present invention includes features to simplify the keyboarding process and to speed up the input. An analysis had been made of the total number of Chinese characters contained in one of the more representative dictionaries, such as the Pinyin ChineseEnglish dictionary. Those radicals with the highest numbers of characters grouped under them, and the most frequently used characters in Chinese text have been selected and placed on individual keys on the keyboard 28. The keys for inputting radicals make up the normal and shift keyboards, and are the upper two corners of the keys see Figure 2 . Those radicals for the most commonly used characters have also been placed in the most convenient keyboard positions for ease of operator access. Pressing one of the radical keys will enter the complete radical code word into the microcomputer 18 with the microcomputer 18 ready to receive the stroke and character number to complete the identification process of the desired character to be printed. Striking a radical key twice will put the first character in that radical s list, which quite often is that radical in character form. The most commonly occurring individual characters have been placed in the lower left and lower right hand corners of the keys. Striking an individual key for a particular character causes the microcomputer 18 to generate all three code words to uniquely identify that character. The following is an example of how the present invention inputs the code words to uniquely identify a desired character to be printed. If the radical for the desired character appears on the keyboard, such as for example the character , and the radical t is represented by an , a space by the letter s, then the number previously used to present the character A 174 2 2 would result in key strokes 2s2s. Since the s uses the space bar, the affect is the same as the space in the English keyboard and wouldn t be counted in the keystrokes per word. This example required only three decisional keystrokes, the space bar strikes representing non decisional strokes.This results in easy and rapid keyboard entry. This occurs because in the character input mode of the program, the space bar entry fills the remaining code words in the character number with zeros as needed, one at a time.When all seven digits for the three code numbers are input, the program immediately searches for the character and inputs it to the edit screen. The most complicated character designation could be, for example, a three digit radical, a two digit stroke and a two digit character number, i.e., 111 11 11. However, the radicals likely to have high numbers of strokes and characters under them have been selected out of the basic list for easier access. Since about 55 of the radical list have so few characters that the stroke number is not used, that is, the stroke number is equal to zero and there is only one list of characters under the radical, identification of the character will only require the radical and the character number which will also speed entry for those particular characters.For example, the entry 135s2s identifies the second characterljir t ffiunder the radicals. Note that after the radical number only one space bar entry is necessary to input two zeros to fill the stroke position. For the preferred embodiment of the present invention, two sets of Chinese character are available in the mass storage device 12. A character is created by a small field or matrix of dots which is stored in electronic memory and reproduced as tiny dots on the CRT screen to later be printed. The primary set is a matrix of 20 x 20 dots which appear on the CRT screen as a field of 20 x 20 pixels. Chinese characters outputted to a printer, such as a business letter, uses the same 20 x 20 matrix information to create the characters. A typical dot matrix pin printer can be used to produce the Chinese character. A second set of characters are also stored in the mass storage device 12 in a 40 x 40 dot matrix format. At this size, 20 characters can be displayed in a 4 x 5 array on the CRT display means with good clarity and detail. Characters this size will be displayed when the operator types a radical, stoke and characters number sequence ending in zero. This allows an operator to find a character when only the radical number and stroke count are known. Up to 20 characters will be displayed for selection for the designated radical stroke code. If there were more than 20 characters available, which is not the usual case but which will happen occasionally, then the twentieth position will signal that more characters are available. By pushing the key shown in position 20 the additional characters will be displayed. For normal business uses there will never be a situation when more than one additional screen will be needed to locate a character under a particular radicalstroke designation. Corresponding to the 4 x 5 array of characters in the CRT is an array of keys on the left side of the keyboard see Figure 3 for a correspondence between the screen character positions in the CRT 24 and the associated array of keys on the keyboard . Actuation of a corresponding key on the array of keys causes the character appearing in the corresponding position in the array of displayed characters in the CRT 24 to be placed into the character array 26 of the edit screen of the characters to be printed. An alternate method is available for identifying the desired character to be printed is provided along with the characters contained in a particular radical stroke designation and displayed in the CRT 24. Beneath each displayed character can be shown the radical stroke character number corresponding to that particular character. Therefore, by keying in the character number code word along with the previously inputted radical and stroke code words for the desired character to be printed, enables the microcomputer 18 to retrieve the desired character from mass storage 12. Referring now to Figures 3 a and b , 4, and 5, a computer flow diagram for a portion of the programming of microcomputer according to the present invention is shown. Programming of the Apple II Plus microprocessor is in theApple Pascal language. The computer flow diagram ofFigures 3 a and b represents the decisional steps in the command routine INSERT which will control the placing of the next character to be printed into the array of characters 26 in the display means 24. The functional block shown in Figure 3 a as GET CHAR NAME is the place in the program for the operator to type the radical, stroke count and character number into the microcomputer 18. When the operator has inputted the required code information according to either of the above described embodiments, the program will eventually enter the subroutine RETRIEVE CHAR. The function of this subroutine is to retrieve from the mass storage device 12 the encoded character according to the inputted radical, stroke and character number code words.Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the computer flow diagram for the subroutine RETRIEVE CHAR. A detailed description of the step by step operations of the computer program routines illustrated in Figures 3 a and b , 4, and 5 is not being presented since a person of ordinary skill in computer programming, having the benefit of the disclosure of the flow diagrams and the above descriptions, could produce the necessary coding of the program routines. In general, however, Figure 3 a illustrates the process for retrieving a character according to the first embodiment of the invention described above, while Figure 3 b illustrates the retrieval process according to the alternate embodiment. In summary, the Chinese typewriter 1 according to the present invention operates from keyboard code word entries representing the radical of a desired character to be printed, the number of calligraphy strokes in addition to the radical required to draw the character and a character number corresponding to the position of the character in a dictionary table of characters having the radical stroke designation. From the inputted radical, stroke and character number code words, the microcomputer 18 retrieves from the mass storage device 12 the desired character encoded in a dot matrix format and displays in a CRT display means 24 the selected character to be printed. As each character is identified, it is placed into a displayed character position in an array of characters 26 on the CRT 24.When the desired text has been created, as displayed in CRT 24, the text is transmitted for printing as hard copy, as for example, on dot matrix printer 10 or via a modem 20 to a remote output device, such as a line printer or other CRT displays. To increase speed of entry of the required codes to identify a chosen character, the more frequently occurring characters in Chinese text have been assigned particular keys on the keyboard 28. Striking a character key causes the microcomputer 18 to generate the necessary radical, stroke and character number for that character without further input requirement from the operator.Additionally, those radicals having the largest number of characters derived therefrom are also assigned to a particular key on the keyboard 28. By striking one of those keys, the radical code is automatically generated by the microcomputer 18 so that the operator now only has to input the stroke and character number to complete the unique identification of the desired character to be printed. When the complete character is not known, but the radical and stroke number is, microcomputer 18 displays for the operator each encoded character having the radicalstroke designation. These characters are displayed in an array of character positions and at operator s option can show the radical stroke character number. If the desired character is displayed in CRT 24, the operator may select the character by actuating a key on keyboard 28 corresponding to the character position in the CRT 24 of the desired character, or the operator may input the correct character number for the character to complete the radical stroke character number input. Where the order of the characters having the same R S index are specified by the frequency of use of the character, rather than its common position in a standardChinese Dictionary, the operator may depress the RightArrow key as the third code in the R S C entry. The most frequently occurring character of the R S characters is displayed in the text. If this is the character desired, depressing the Space Bar key selects the character and begins the next selection process. If the displayed character is not the desired character, depressing the Right Arrow key causes the next lower character in theR S list to be displayed. This process may continue until the desired character is being displayed. With these methods, the present invention is able to obtain a high speed character encoding methodology with a minimum of keyboard entry strokes from a simple keyboard entry means to uniquely identify and generate the Chinese characters to be printed. In describing the invention, reference has been made to a preferred embodiment. However, those skilled in the art and familiar with the disclosure of the invention may recognize additions, deletions, substitutions or other modifications which would fall within the purview of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, it would be possible to modify the keyboard arrangement as shown in Figure 2 to increase the number of keyboard levels through the use of the ESCAPE key or by splitting the space bar into two different space bars to increase the number of key entries. Other keyboard key assignments could also be developed. Additionally, rather than storing each encoded character in a dot matrix format, other techniques for storing information adequate to enable a commonly available printing device to create a Chinese ideograph could be used.
