# REUSABLE ANCHOR BOLT ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An anchor bolt assembly includes a sleeve like expander made of a resilient material, an end plate attached to the distal or innermost end of the expander, a flange mounted on the pro ximal or outermost end of the expander, and a fastener. In use, the assembly serves to anchor an object to a substrate, such as a wall. The fastener is inserted through a longitudinal open ing in the expander and threadably engages the end plate in order to apply an axial compression force to the expander, which force causes the resilient expander to bulge outward to contact the inside surface of an opening in the substrate. This longitudinal compression and transverse expansion of the ex pander causes the assembly to be securely anchored in the substrate opening. The flange provides a wide base against which the axial compression force generated by the fastener and end plate can act. In one embodiment, the flange is integral with the resilient expander, while in a second ambodiment the flange is non resilient to provide additional support to the fastener and prevent the cold flow of the expander material. Advantageously, the anchor bolt assembly is reusable and can be utilized in conjunction with a wide variety of substrate materials and thicknesses.
