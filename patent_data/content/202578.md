# METHOD FOR PRODUCING ELASTOMERIC OPTICAL FIBER

## Abstract
An elastomeric optical fiber comprising a core made of an elastomer with rubbery elasticity and a cladding surrounding the core and having low attenuation of light transmission is produced by a method comprising flowing down a liquid polymer for the core with cross linking it, and simultaneously with or after the formation of the core, providing the cladding around the core.
