## Abstract
A remote controlled door lock designed for use in access control systems has a spring bolt 1 adapted to be withdrawn by a handle driven follower 12 or a keylock cylinder . The bolt head 5 engages in a keeper 6 and can be retainded in the locked condition by a pin 15 driven by a double acting solenoid 14 to engage in a slot 17 in the bolt. In this condition the pin 15 also depresses one end of a pivoted bar 10 by which the follower 13 is linked to the bolt so that no forcing load can be applied to the solenoid locking mechanism through the handle. Opening of the door from this condition can only be achieved by release of the pin 15 by the solenoid 14 on recognition of a correct code presented to an associated card reader or similar device not shown .
