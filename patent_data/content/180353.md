## Description
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of silicates which contain aluminium, a method of preparation from reactive silicas, and use of the calcium silicates as absorbent materials. It is known in the prior art to prepare calcium silicates by the reaction of a reactive silica or clay by the addition of silica to a lime suspension in a batch reaction. Calcium silicates are also known to be absorbent materials. See for example U. S. Patents 1,574,363 and 3, 33,648. U. S. Patent 1,422, 4 to Sherwin discloses a method of recovering sodium aluminate from aluminium containing ore, wherein the ore is reacted with lime at sintering temperatures. Lime and silica are reacted and calcined in the absence of sodium oxide and soluble aluminum in Endres U. S. Patent 1,613,448. U. S. Patent 2,438,488 to Anderson et al is directed to a process for producing Portland cement wherein aluminium, calcium, sodium, and silica are reacted at sintering temperatures to form calcium alumino silicate intermediates. The intermediates have a CaO to SiO₂ molar ratio of 1.9 to 2. 1. A pigment prepared by the reaction of an alkaline earth metal silicate and aluminum sulfate in an aqueous medium is disclosed in U. S. Patent 2,786,758 to Taylor. The pigment, which is used in the production of paper, does not contain sodium. U. S. Patent 2,888,377 to Allen describes the reaction of calcium hydroxide and silica under superatmospheric conditions, in the absence of sodium or soluble aluminium, to produce crystalline calcium silicate pigments useful in the production of paper. Hydrated calcium silicates formed by the hydrothermal reaction of lime and silica are also disclosed in U. S. Patent 2,995,447 as anti caking agents or dispersing agents in dried dairy products. According to this patent, the reaction between lime and silica is carried out in the presence of water at an elevated temperature. This product does not appear to contain any other component such as aluminium. U. S. Patent 3,238, 52 to Burak discloses a process for the production of silicates by reaction of a reactive silica, lime, and alumina in an aqueous solution. There were several disadvantages to this process. The aluminium was derived from aluminum sulfate and aluminium alum, both of which contain SO₄. In the present invention, the presence of SO₄ has been shown to cause a reduction in the oil absorption property of the resulting pigment. In addition, the silicate product does not contain Na₂O, which has been shown by the present invention to produce lower density and higher oil absorbing products. U. S. Patent 3,264,13 to Mays discloses a process for producing silicate pigments, and the pigments produced therefrom, wherein reactive silicas are reacted with alkaline earth metal hydroxides. While the reactive silicas used in this patent contain alumina, the alumino component is apparently not reactive. Further, Na₂O is not used in the reaction. The resulting pigment therefore has a lower oil absorption proportion than pigments produced from reactions wherein reactive alumina and Na₂O are present. Finally, the pigments of the patent are crystalline or polymorphous in nature. This patent is probably the basis for a product of this type sold by the J. M. Huber Corporation under the trademark NOPAK in the 196 s. U. S. Patent 3,567,667 discloses mould lining compositions which comprise a ball mill dust and calcium silicate or calcium alumino silicate fibrous refractory material. In this patent the calcium silicate and calcium alumino silicate materials are described as being preferably slag wool or a material known as Eldorite. U. S. Patent 4,243,429 to Tamura et al describes a process for making the mineral tobermorite by reacting a lime and a siliceous material containing alumina in an alkali solution under hydrothermal conditions. The tobermorite has the formula 5 CaO 6 SiO₂ 5 H₂O, and contains no Na₂O or Al₂O₃. Additionally, ettringite, a calcium alumino sulfate, is produced. The present invention provides an amorphous alkaline earth metal alumino silicate which has use as an absorbent material in many areas. It is accordingly one object of the invention to provide a series of amorphous calcium silicates which contain aluminum. A further object of the invention is to provide a series of alkaline earth metal silicates which contain aluminum which are amorphous in form and which have a very high structure and high oil absorption which makes these materials suitable as absorbents because of their high absorptive capacity. A still further object of the present invention is to provide amorphous calcium silicate materials which contain aluminium and have very high structure and high oil absorption and which are prepared by the reaction of an alkaline earth metal oxide or hydroxide with a reactive silica material and a source of reactive aluminium. An even further object of the invention is to provide calcium silicates which are useful as carriers and absorbents, and compositions which contain the calcium silicates. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description thereof proceeds. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for the preparation of an amorphous alkaline earth metal silicate of the formula The alkaline earth metal silicates so produced are useful as absorbents or carriers to form dry liquids in wettable powders, conditioning agents or fillers in paints, rubber and paper, and as grinding aids in chemical waste and disposal. The alkaline earth metal silicates prepared according to the invention maybe used in paints, rubber and paper as conditioning agents, carriers or as fillers, and may be used in dry liquids and wettable powders as absorptive agents. As indicated, the present invention provides a method for the preparation of a series of alkaline earth metal silicates which contain aluminium and are amorphous in form, have very high structures, high oil absorption and are useful as carriers and absorbents in various areas. The products are prepared by the reaction of an alkaline earth metal oxide or hydroxide with a reactive source of silica and a source of reactive aluminium, preferably in the presence of an alkali metal oxide. The alkaline earth metal silicates can be broadly described by the following general formula The expression source of aluminium means alumina Al₂O₃ in any of its reactive forms, and including mixtures and preferably alkali metal aluminates such as sodium aluminate. The compositions produced by the method of this invention are referred to herein as alkaline earth metal silicates, e.g., calcium silicates. However, since the compositions of the invention also contain aluminium, they may also be referred to as alkaline earth metal aluminosilicates. While the above represents the broad embodiment of the invention, the following is the preferred embodiment of the invention The products may be characterized as being amorphous, having a very high structure, and as having an oil absorption in the range of 4 to 6 ml 1 g, preferably 55 to 6 ml 1 g, by the Rub Out method. These oil absorption ranges are dependent on the source of reactive silica. A silica that is more reactive produces higher oil absorption products. The addition of reactive aluminum as specified in this invention, will further increase this oil absorption or the oil absorption of products produced from a less reactive source of silica. High oil absorption provides a low density for the products. The products are also characterized as having a surface area in the range of about 1 to 4 m² g. The pack density ranges from about .2 to .3 g ml. The pour density ranges from about .1 to .2 g ml. The products also have high brightness ranging from about 7 to 95. The products of the present invention are prepared by the reaction of an alkaline earth metal hydroxide or oxide in an aqueous medium with a reactive silica and a reactive alumina containing material. The reactive alumina containing material may be sodium aluminate or alumina. The reactive silica is the insoluble product resulting from mineral acid leaching of silica clay or precipitated silica. The final properties that can be attained are dependent on the reactivity of the silica. The silica may be a clay which has been treated with a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid, to produce alum or aluminium sulfate and an insoluble reactive silica called Esellar , which is a sulfuric acid leached reactive clay. Esellar is a product of this process and is produced by the J. M. Huber Corporation. This reactive silica material is thus a byproduct of the production of alum and is a particularly suitable source as a starting material for the process of the present invention. The leached clay must be filtered and washed to remove residual alum before it can be used in this process. The reactive silica generally contains about 7 to 15 wt. of Al₂O₃, about 8 to 9 wt. of SiO₂, preferably greater than about 85 wt. of SiO₂, about 5 to 16 wt. of water and about 5 to 1 wt. of impurities. Note SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and impurities are on an anhydrous basis. The silica is reactive and the presence of the alumina provides a source of unreactive alumina in the starting material to provide the final products of the present invention. The reactive portion of the alumina is provided by sodium aluminate solution. Alkali metal oxide is provided by the sodium aluminate solution, in the case of sodium oxide, and or caustic solution or other suitable sources of alkali metal oxide. The reaction is preferably carried out in an aqueous medium and under conditions ranging from atmospheric pressure and temperatures of ambient to 1 In the preferred embodiment it is preferred to initially prepare a freshly slaked lime Ca OH ₂ and add this lime composition to a slurry of the reactive silica. A portion of the aluminum may be present in the silica, the remainder may be added following the addition of the metal oxide slurry in the form of sodium aluminate which will of course also provide sodium as sodium oxide in the mixture. Additional alkali metal oxide may be added as caustic solution. This is the preferred order of addition of reactants. In the reacting composition, the batch composition range on a molar basis is as follows The preferred batch composition on a molar basis is as follows After completion of the reaction, the solid is separated from the mixture by filtration or centrifugation and washed with water and dried. The product is then in condition for use as an absorbent material. In a further embodiment of the invention, physical product characteristics may be improved by spray drying to produce a spray dried product using known methods. A spray dried product is free flowing, and is especially desirable in many applications. In a still further embodiment the dried product may be milled to produce a product of very fine particle size. Alternatively, the dried product may be beaded or pelletized by known methods to produce particles of any desired size. When used as a carrier, an absorbent or filler, the compositions are incorporated as a dried solid in paints, rubber and paper, and in other materials such as agricultural goods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics by means known to the art. A particularly preferred area of use for the compositions resulting according to the invention is as a carrier or drying agent for oils and chemicals. A preferred composition will contain about 25 to 4 wt. of the alkaline earth metal silicate and about 6 to 75 wt. of the oil or chemical. This provides a semi pasty product with most oils and liquid chemicals. While the physical form of such compositions varies with the characteristics, the alkaline earth metal silicates of the invention will usually absorb sufficient oil at 6 to 75 oil loadings to produce a resulting composition which is a dry, flowable powder. Thus the compositions resulting according to the invention have outstanding characteristics as carriers, absorbents, and drying agents. The following examples are presented to illustrate and compare the invention. Examples 1, 2, 5, 7, 9 and 10 illustrate the invention but the invention is not considered as limited thereto. Examples 3, 4, 6 and 8 are comparison examples. In the examples and throughout the specification, parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated. In this example, Esellar is the silica source. A batch composition with alumina addition is prepared by adding 239.63 grams of a slurry of freshly slaked calcium hydroxide of the composition 13.61 wt. CaO, to 1236.47 grams of an acid leached clay slurry containing 5.65 wt. SiO₂ and .5 wt. residual Al₂O₃. To the resulting slurry are added 24.25 grams of reactive sodium aluminate solution having a composition of 33.28 Na₂O and 6.8 Al₂O₃. The slurry is then reacted at 175 On completion of the reaction, the solid is filtered, washed with water and dried. The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 574 ml 1 grams. This example illustrates a calcium silicate prepared from a source of silica other than Esellar and at atmospheric conditions. The silica source is a precipitated silica. A batch composition with alumina addition is prepared by adding 113.72g of a slurry of freshly slaked lime Ca OH ₂ of the composition 12.25 wt. CaO, to 76 .78g of a reactive silica slurry containing 3.92 wt. SiO₂. To the resulting slurry is added 7.88g of sodium aluminate solution having a composition of 18.7 Na₂O and 24.2 Al₂O₃. The slurry is then reacted at 1 On completion of the reaction, the solid is filtered, washed with water and dried. The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 545 ml 1 grams. The following examples 3 through 5 illustrate the detrimental effect of aluminum sulphate addition and illustrate the positive effect of reactive aluminium addition on the reaction. A precipitated silica is the silica source. A reference batch with no alumina or sodium oxide addition is prepared by adding 156. 2g of a slurry of freshly slaked lime Ca OH ₂ of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 782.82g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.75 wt. SiO₂. The slurry is then reacted at 1 On completion of the reaction the material is handled as outlined in example 2. The resulting pigment exhibited an oil absorption of 5 ml 1 grams. This example illustrates the loss in oil absorption, compared with the reference Example 3 , when using alum as an alumina source. In reference to disclosures in U. S. Patents 3,264,13 Mays and 3,238, 52 Burak , the following example illustrates the loss in product properties when the source of alumina is aluminium sulfate. A batch composition with alum addition is prepared by adding 156. 2g of a slurry of freshly slaked lime of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 772.82g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.83 wt. SiO₂, added as precipitated silica. To the resulting slurry are added 19.8 g of aluminium sulphate solution containing 6. 7 Al₂O₃, followed by 12. 1g caustic solution containing 38.75 Na₂O. The slurry is then reacted at 1 The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 474 ml 1 grams. The following illustrates the increase in oil absorption due to the addition of sodium and aluminum, when compared with Example 3. Precipitated silica is the silica source. A batch composition with alumina addition is prepared by adding 156. 2g freshly slaked lime slurry of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 782.82g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.75 wt. SiO₂. To the resulting slurry is added 5.27g sodium aluminate solution having a composition of 18.7 Na₂O and 24.2 Al₂O₃, followed by the addition of 9.47g caustic solution having a composition of 38.75 Na₂O. The resulting slurry is then reacted at 1 The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 535 ml 1 grams. The following examples 6 to 8 illustrate the detrimental effect of aluminium sulphate addition, as well as the effect of reactive aluminium addition. Acid leached clay is used as the silica source in the reference batch. A reference batch without alumina or sodium oxide is prepared by adding 145.41g lime slurry of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 729.53g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.76 wt. SiO₂ and .51 wt. residual Al₂O₃. The resulting slurry is then reacted at 1 On completion of the reaction the solid is filtered and dried. The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 455 ml 1 grams. The following is a standard example of acid leached clay, lime, alumina and caustic, that illustrates this invention. An increase in oil absorption is observed as compared with Example 6. A batch composition with alumina addition is prepared by adding 145.41g lime slurry of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 725.77g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.79 wt. SiO₂ and .52 wt. residual Al₂O₃. To the resulting slurry are added 2.95g of sodium aluminate solution having a composition of 18.7 Na₂O and 24.2 Al₂O₃, followed by 1 .91g of caustic solution containing 38.75 Na₂O. The resulting slurry is then reacted at 1 The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 516 ml 1 grams. This example illustrates the loss in oil absorption, compared with the reference Example 6 , when using alum as an aluminium source. In reference to disclosures in patents 3,264,13 Mays and 3,238, 52 Burak , where the use of aluminum sulfate is illustrated, a batch composition, with alumina being supplied by aluminum sulfate solution, is prepared by adding 145.41g of lime slurry composition 13.47 wt. CaO is added to 725.77g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.79 wt. SiO₂ and .52 wt. residual Al₂O₃. To the resulting slurry are added 12.32g of aluminum sulphate solution having a composition of 6. 7 Al₂O₃, followed by 12.32g of caustic solution containing 38.75 Na₂O. The resulting slurry is then reacted at 1 The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 362 ml 1 grams. This illustrates the substitution of KOH for the additional caustic used with the sodium aluminate. A batch composition similar to Example 5 is prepared by adding 156. 2g of lime slurry of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 782.82g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.75 wt. SiO₂. To the resulting slurry are added 5.27g sodium aluminate solution having a composition of 18.7 Na₂O and 24.2 Al₂O₃, followed by 11.25g caustic potash KOH solution containing 38.4 K₂O. The resulting slurry is then reacted at 1 The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 487 ml 1 grams. This example illustrates the substitution of potassium aluminate for sodium aluminate and KOH for the additional caustic. A batch composition is prepared by adding 156. 2g lime slurry of the composition 13.47 wt. CaO, to 782.82g of a reactive silica slurry containing 5.75 wt. SiO₂. To the resulting slurry is added 8.45g of potassium aluminate solution of the composition 24.3 K₂O and 17.3 Al₂O₃, followed by 13.75g of KOH solution containing 38.4 K₂O. The resulting slurry is then reacted at 1 The resulting product exhibited an oil absorption of 5 5 ml 1 grams. The calcium silicate products of the present invention compare favorably with commercial products known as Micro Cel E and Micro Cel C . These products are the products described in U. S. Patents 3, 33,648, and 2,995,447 discussed above. To compare the products resulting according to the present invention, samples of Micro Cel E were obtained and tested using the testing procedures of the present invention. There was some variance with these testing procedures from the published data on the characteristics of Micro Cel E . Set forth herein in the table below is a comparison of the products of Examples 1 and 2 with applicant s assignee s results for testing of Micro Cel E , together with the published results of Micro Cel E and Micro Cel C . Micro Cel E and Micro Cel C are trademarks of the Manville Corporation for a line of absorbents and conditioners. These products were characterized with respect to brightness, oil absorption, water absorption, surface area, average particle size, screen residue, pour density, pack density, bulk density and pH. The results are set forth in the following table. As will be apparent from the results of the above table, the products prepared according to the present invention exhibit characteristics equal to or superior to the commercial product Micro Cel E which is a calcium silicate product. In particular, the products are characterized by substantially improved brightness and surface area as compared to the products of the prior art. In this specification, the oil absorption was determined by the ASTM Rub Out method Amer. Soc. Test. Mater. Stand., D. 281 . This test is based on the principle of mixing linseed oil with a pigment by rubbing with a spatula on a smooth surface until a stiff putty like paste is formed. By measuring the quantity of oil required to produce a very stiff, putty like paste, which will not break or separate when it is cut with the spatula, one can measure the oil absorption of pigments a value which represents the volume of oil required per unit weight of pigment to saturate the pigments absorptive capacity. The oil absorption value is calculated by the following equation Surface area was determined by the nitrogen absorption method of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller BET , J.A.C.S., The invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments. However, as obvious variations thereon will become apparent to those skilled in the art, the invention is not to be considered as limited thereto.
