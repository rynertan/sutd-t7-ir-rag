# Fail passive actuator control.

## Abstract
An actuator of the type used in aircraft flight controls and similar applications is combined with a fail passive elec trohydraulic control system 11 that affords the usual actuator to electrical input commands during normal opera tion, and responds to any of a number of possible failure conditions to dispose the actuator in a passive or neutral failure mode. The passive failure mode allows the actuator 15 to remain in the last known valid position or move in response to an external force such as provided by a redundant backup actuator thereby avoiding a possibly dangerous flight condition that can result from a hard over actuator response to a failure condition. First and second unbalanced electrohydraulic servo actuator controls 14 and 16 are connected in back to back closed control loops between the actuator 15 and electrical command inputs 14e and 16e to form a balanced actuator configuration, and the separate control loops are synchronized by a synchroniz ing piston and associated electrical position transducer 24 that enable normal actuator operation so long as a predeter mined relationship exists between the supply pressure Ps and the sum of the fluid pressures Pc1 and Pc2 applied to opposite sides of the actuator. Any failure condition results in unsynchronising the separate control loops and equalizing the pressures at opposite sides of the actuator, thereby producing the fail passive mode.
