# Method and connecting member for providing a joint between structural components.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a way of forming, in a simple manner, corner joints or the like in structures, such as articles of furniture incorporation panels of chipboard. A typical corner joint is formed using a connecting member 7 in the form of a length cut from an extrusion of constant cruciform cross section, adjacent edges of two panels 2, 4 defining the corner being secured in respective diagonally opposite channels of four V section channels defined by the extrusion, that one of the two remaining channels which faces outwardly from the corner being occupied by a filling member 10. The longitudinally extending edge faces of the two webs 11 of the cruciform cross section which extend outwardly may be flush with the adjoining outer surfaces of the panels 2, 4 and the filling member to present the appearance of inlays.
