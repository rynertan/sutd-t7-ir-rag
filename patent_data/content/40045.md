# Read only memory device.

## Abstract
A read only memory device in which the presence or absence of a MOS transistor Q₁ in a memory cell located at each intersection between word lines WL₀ to WL₇ and bit lines BL₀ to BL₇ is disclosed. In this device, when data belonging to one word line is written into the memory cells, the original data or the inverted data of theoriginal data is written. The determination whether or not the data is inverted is performed in accordance with the number of data 0 OR 1 belonging to each word line WL₀ to WL₇ .
