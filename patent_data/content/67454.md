# Silent discharge type pulse laser device.

## Abstract
The silent discharge pulse laser device comprises a pair of opposite electrodes 1, 2 at least one of which is a dielectric electrode, a laser resonator consisting of a total reflection mirror 6 and a semi reflection mirror 7 mounted opposite to each other with a silent discharge section 3 in between, a source 50 of high frequency voltage for supplying to said pair of electrodes a high frequency voltage having a predetermined period for silent discharge, and means 60 for controlling said high frequency voltage from said source with respect to a first interval and a second interval that make up a period longer than said period for silent discharge. Said high frequency voltage has a first peak voltage value during said first interval and at a second peak voltage value during said second interval, wherein said second peak voltage value is sufficient to cause discharge but insufficient to excite laser oscillation.
