# LOW ENERGY PROCESSING OF THERMOPLASTIC POLYMERS

## Abstract
In the operation of a melter mixer gear pump system for processing synthetic thermoplastic materials, an improve ment is disclosed which comprises controlling the operating temperature of the materials passing therethrough by speed adjustment of the gear pump 29 which affects, in a proportional relationship, the energy transmitted through the melter mixer 10 to the materials.
