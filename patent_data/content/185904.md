# Tailored document building.

## Abstract
A method of, and system for, tailoring a master docu ment to obtain a special document. The master document is made up of data objects and portions of the data objects. Included in the portions are pointers to corresponding data objects. The portions are windowed and displayed. Selection of a window will result in a view port being opened through the window into a corresponding data object. The data object can then be scrolled to obtain a desired portion to be included in the special document. As each desired portion is obtained, it is stored and becomes part of the special document.

## Description
DescriptionTAILORED DOCUMENT BUILDING Technical FieldThis invention relates generally to document editing, and more specifically to a method of, and system for, specially tailoring a master document. Background ArtDocument tailoring or new document creation utilizing a master document as a basis has up to now been a batch, cut and paste, etc., type of editing operation. An operator using an application driven device controlled display standalone, or host connected, computer work station or system today can cause the master document to be loaded into memory from a disk, and begin displaying and scroll through the document. Undesired portions can be deleted and desired portions can be edited. On paper, this sounds simple and straightforward. However, much attention, time, and keying are required. A single character can be deleted with very few keystrokes, but paragraphs must be cursored and bracketed prior to deletion.To aid in document tailoring, split screen facilities or application programs are available for viewing and comparing various portions of the master document in a side by side manner. In using these facilities, one can, for example, create two view ports and cause one portion to be displayed on the top half of a display screen and a different portion to be displayed on the bottom half of the screen. Side by side viewing is also possible. In addition, capabilities have been provided to further divide the screen. Commonly, on the first division the screen is divided into halves, on the secon i i t or the screen is divided into fourths, etc.In recent times, windowing systems or applications have become popular. Different portions of a document can be reviewed and compared, but separate windows must be created. Creating separate windows requires operator time, effort, and attention. In addition, to meet as many operator wants or needs as possible, users have increased the applications capability to the extent that windows can be increased or decreased in size. This can be for purposes of either magnification or increasing the size of the portion of the document being viewed.Whether using standard editing approaches, split screens, or windowing applications, absent has been a flexible and user friendly interface for readily creating a tailored document.From the above, a tailored document can be created.However, clear deficiencies exist, and these deficiencies cause the prior art to fall short of either anticipating the instant invention or rendering the instant invention obvious. More specifically, the instant invention presents an advance over prior art systems, applications, and techniques in that an operator can readily select various portions of a master document and build a document for a specialized need. Building is from a plurality of windowed portions of the master document displayed on a screen at the same time. Each window provides a view port into a portion of the master document and the portion can be scrolled in the window to select what is to be included in the tailored document.The windows are system generated and are used to automatically bracket information or data which an operator desires to be included in the tailored document.The advantages of this advance are reduced operator attention, keying, and confusion. Disclosure of the InventionA unique method of, and system for, building a specially tailored document from a master document are provided to improve user friendliness and system flexibility, and reduce operator attention. Given a master document made up of data objects and stored along with a corresponding collection of portions of the data objects, the portions can be individually windowed and displayed to an operator. When a portion is selected, a view port is created into a corresponding data object. The data object can then be scrolled in the view port formed by the window for obtaining a desired portion of the data object for inclusion in the tailored document. Brief Description of the DrawingFig. 1 illustrates a document previously edited with multiple data objects on the page.Fig. 2 illustrates a view of the entire data area of a data object which is not all visible within the object window.Fig. 3 illustrates the results of scrolling the data within the object window to view different data.Fig. 4 illustrates enlarging the window to view more data in the data area. Best Mode for Carrying Out the invention General Overview and DefinitionsAs a preferred embodiment, the instant invention will be packaged as, or included in, an application program. For purposes of conciseness, application program will be abbreviated to application hereinafter. The application will have been written by a user or programmer for use in either a word processing or computing syst 3 M g by an operator. The systems contemplated include standalone and host connected device controlled display work stations. The system display will preferably be of an all points addressable APA cathode ray tube CRT type.The face of the display will be referred to as a screen.When a window is created, only a portion of the screen will be occupied by the window which will generally be bordered. When created, a window of default size will be presented to the operator. The window can thereafter be moved, and either enlarged or diminished in size. As a practical matter, the window can be varied in size from very small up to a point that it fills the entire screen.Window manipulation in terms of locating and sizing on the screen, as a broad concept, is well known and forms no part of the instant invention. The term document is meant to include storable and retrievable information.The information can be in the form of text, graphics, tables, etc., which will be referred to hereinafter as data types.Device control includes control of the display by a keyboard, joy stick, light pen, mouse, scratch pad, etc., or any combination of such devices. By system control is meant hardware and or software control of the system.For the following detailed description, it is to be assumed that at the beginning of operation for creating the master document, a menu is presented to the operator.The operator can select a data type such as a graphic object, table, etc., along with other parameters such as margin settings, etc., by keying to the menu. Keying to the menu results in a data object being defined or specified. Upon completion of keying to the menu, the system will cause a window to be built on the screen into which data can be input. The data input into the window can be much larger than the window. For example, if a text data object has been specified for one portion of the document to be built, the text input into the window can be several physical pages long. Handling of the excess text is by scrolling in the window during input.Compared to the window size, the text can be many times larger. Upon completion of input of the data object or portion of the document being built, the menu is recalled. A different data object can then be specified.Upon completion of defining this new data object, the system will cause another window to be built on the screen below the previous window. At this time, displayed in the previous window will be the last part of the data input up to window size limitations.Ultimately, the screen will be filled with windows. When this occurs and a new data object is specified, the system will cause the windows already on the screen to be scrolled to provide room for another window.Each data object created in the above manner is stored in order of creation. The windowed data at the completion of input is also stored in the order the windows are created. Stored along with each of the windowed data is a pointer to a corresponding data object. At the beginning of operation for purposes of the following description, a plurality of windows containing the windowed data are called and displayed on the screen.When one of the windows is selected, a view port is opened through the window into the corresponding data object. The view through the view port is of the same data windowed in the window prior to selection.Thereafter, the data object can be scrolled in the selected window for selecting a desired portion of the data object for inclusion in the document being tailored from the master document which is made up of the data objects.Selection of the window can be by means of a mouse controlled pointing cursor and a select button on the mouse. Selection of a portion of the data object for inclusion in the tailored document can also be by mouse button depression. The extent of selection of a portion of the data object is defined by the window size. This avoids normal bracketing and defining operations. Detailed DescriptionFor a more detailed understanding of the invention, it is to be assumed that use is of a standalone keyboard display computing system such as an IBM PersonalComputer configured with a keyboard, an APA display, a black and white monitor, a graphics adaptor, a disk drive, an operating system, a mouse, sufficient working memory, and diskettes containing the master document and an application containing the instant invention. Further assume the system has been powered on, etc., and that the application of this invention has been loaded and is running.Reference is now made to Figure 1. In this figure there is illustrated a screen 1. When the operator begins an editing session and specifies a document to be edited which was created previously, the application displays the data objects of the document within on screen 1.Text data object 2, graphic data object 3, and table data object 4 represent the data objects contained within the document.Referring to Fig. 2, data area 5 represents the entire data belonging to the data object 6. Only the portion 7 is currently visible through object window 8. When operation is within the window, the point of operation can be denoted by a cursor 9. As cursor 9 is moved by a device, the point of operation is moved. The device can be a mouse, keyboard, joystick, etc. The particular characteristics of cursor 9 are unimportant as far as this invention is concerned. That is, the cursor could be a standard textual type cursor, etc. Cursor location and movement are directly related to editing. Editing encompasses insertion, deletion, replacement, etc., operations. Cursor 9 as shown in Fig. 2 denotes the data object selected and to be scrolled.When the operator performs a scrolling action of the data within object window 8, the contents within object window 8 will scroll. The effects of this action will result in the operator viewing a different portion of the data within the window.Fig. 3 represents the data object 6 following operator scrolling. Object window 8 is displaying the data represented by portion 10. The entire data belonging to the object resides in data area 5.Next, the operator requests that the size of the object window 8 be increased to allow more of the data in the data area 5 to be viewed.Referring to Fig. 4, object window 8 has been increased in size to accommodate more data from the data area 5.The portion viewed through window 8 is represented by portion 11.Set out below is an illustration of an application program useable by a process or in the workstation or host for tailoring a master document according to this invention. This program is in program design language from which source and object code are derivable.When the application program initiates an editing session, a routine is called to generate the internal structure of the document CALL GET DOC DATA . If a new document is being created by the operator, an empty document structure is created. If a document already exists, the structure of the document will consist of all the data objects created by the operator in a previous editing session. When the document structure is complete, the application calls a routine to allocate a parent document window CALL ALLOCATE DOC WINDOW and then calls a routine to prepare the data objects to be displayed on the screen CALL SET DOC VIEW . A pointer to the object which should be displayed at the top of the screen is input to this routine. This routine traverses through the document structure looking for data objects.For each object in the structure, the routine interfaces with the windowing system to allocate a window a child window of the parent and a data area. The data area is a buffer which contains all the information pertaining to a data object. The routine translates the object data into the data area. The allocated window is of a fixed size defined by the operator or system at the time the object was edited last. The allocated window may also be smaller than the data in the object s data area. A link is maintained between the data object and its respective window and data area. Information about the positions of the objects on the page are also maintained. This routine will translate enough data objects necessary to generate a screen full of information. When all translation necessary has occurred, the routine displays the data on the physical screen.The application, upon completion of displaying the document, enters a state in which the movement of the pointing cursor is being monitored for editing purposes.As the application monitors input from the operator CALLMONITOR INPUT several operator actions may occur. If an action occurred e.g., move, copy, delete , the application calls a routine to process the command CALLPROCESS COMMAND . If the operator specifies that a data object is to be created, the application gets the data object s attributes such as window height and margins by calling a routine CALL GET OBJECT ATTRIBUTES . The application then creates a data object internally and links the data object into the document structure. The placement of the created data object within the document structure is dependent on the selected location in the document where the operator requested the creation of the data object. The data object will be linked following the last data object at the selected location.After the data object is created, the application calls a routine CALL REDISPLAY DOC to display an updated view of the document contents. This routine determines that a new object has been created, and that a window and data area do not exist for the object and will create them. The placement of the object in relation to the other objects in the document are maintained.If the operator requested that the size of the data object s window be adjusted either increased or decreased , the application calls a routine to set the window attributes of the selected data object in the document structure CALL SET OBJECT ATTRIBUTES . The application then calls a routine CALL REDISPLAY DOC to redisplay the updated view of the document contents, and the new size of the data object s window will be reflected. If the operator action to occur is to edit the data within the data object s window, a routine is called to determine which data object window and associated data area is to be edited CALL GET WINDOW PTR . Depending on the type of data CALL GET AREA TYPE in the data object s window, a routine is called to handle the creation and editing process for the type of data. A routine CALL EDIT DRAW is called if draw graphics data is to be created or edited. A routine CALL EDIT BUS is called if business graphics data is to be created or edited. A routine CALL EDIT TABLE is called if table data is to be created or edited. A routine CALLEDIT TEXT is called if text data is to be created or edited.The edit routines are responsible for inserting the data into the objects data areas as data input occurs and for issuing a redisplay of the changed data object contents. The routines also monitor when the data has reached the window boundary so that information scrolling can occur. Upon completion of editing the data object, the application will remember the last view of the data as shown within the data object s window.If the operator action which occurred is scrolling of the data, the application determines what type of scrolling is to occur CALL GET SCROLL MODE TYPE . If scrolling of the object s data area within the window is to occur, a routine is called to determine which data object window and associated data area is to be scrolled CALL GET WINDOW PTR . A routine is then called to determine how much of the data to scroll CALL GET SCROLL AMT .Once the scroll amount has been determined, a routine is called to reset the view of the data within the object s window CALL SET WINDOW VIEW . If it is determined from the call to SET WINDOW VIEW that not enough data exists within the data area to complete the scrolling process, a routine is called CALL GET DATA to fetch more data into the data area. The scrolling is complete when the specified scroll amount has been reached or no more data exists for the object UNTIL SCROLL COMPLETE ORNO MORE DATA The cursor location is updated CALLSET CURSOR LOCATION and a routine is called SAVE WINDOW VIEW to save the current view of the data within the window. If the type of scrolling to occur is document scrolling, normal scrolling of the document CALL SET DOC VIEW will occur.The view of the data object within the data objects windows are locked and will not change as the document is scrolled. The view of the data within the object s window is remembered when the call to SAVE WINDOW VIEW was made as defined above.If the operator elects to terminate the editing session or scroll the data object back into view, the last view within the data object s window is what is displayed. The application continues to monitor input until the editing session is complete UNTIL EDIT COMPLETE . When the editing session is complete, all data within the data object s view ports are stored within the document.Reference is next made to the flow chart of Figure 5 which illustrates operations performed in tailoring a master document according to this inventionFirst, the application initiates the editing session and invokes routines to generate the internal document structure and to display the document data as represented by block 21. Displaying the document involves creating windows and data areas for each object within the document structure. If the document did not exist previously, an empty document is displayed. If the document did exist, a screen full of data information is generated and displayed on the screen. Upon displaying the initial view of the document on the screen, the application is ready to monitor operator input as depicted in block 22. If the input received is to execute an action as shown in block 23, the application determines what type of action occurred.If the operator requested that an object is to be created, the application creates the data object internally, creates the data object s window, and displays the data object on the screen. The process of object creation is shown in block 24. If the operator requested that the size of the data object s window be changed either increased or decreased , the operator specifies the new size and the application adjusts the size of the object s window. The sizing of the window is shown in block 25. The application will show as much data as will fit within the new window size. If any other actions occur, the application executes those actions as shown in block 26.If an action did not occur, the application determines if object editing is to occur as shown in block 27. If object editing is to occur, the application obtains information about the selected data object s window and data area as shown in block 28, and calls the appropriate edit routine to create edit the data as depicted in block 29. If object editing is not occurring, the application determines if a scrolling action is to occur as shown in block 30. If a scrolling action is to occur, the application determines what type of scrolling is to take place. If scrolling of the data object is to occur, the application determines the amount of data to scroll, then scrolls that amount of data within the object s window as depicted in block 31.If scrolling of the document is to occur, the application scrolls the document maintaining the view of the data within the object windows as depicted in block 32. The application continues to monitor operator input until editing is complete as shown in block 33. In summary, a unique method of, and system for, building a specially tailored document from a master document are provided to improve user friendliness and system flexibility, and reduce operator attention. Portions of data objects making up a master document are windowed and displayed to an operator. When a portion is selected, a view port is created into a corresponding data object.The data object can then be scrolled in the view port for obtaining a desired portion of the data object for inclusion in the special document.While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
