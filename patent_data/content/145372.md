# Hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfide over alumina.

## Abstract
The reaction rate for the hydrolysis of carbonyl sulfide in liquid petroleum hydrocarbons over alumna, such as propylene, is greatly increased by maintaining water in the hydrocarbons in an amount of one mole of water per mole of carbonyl sulfide to an upper limit of about ten moles of water per mole of carbonyl sulfide or about 30 of satura tion of the hydrocarbons, whichever upper limit provides the lesser amount of water.
