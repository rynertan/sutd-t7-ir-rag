# A connector and packaging structure for a semiconductor device employing the connector.

## Abstract
A connector has an insulating substrate 3 having a plurality of holes 6 and a desired first circuit pattern on it. Female contactors 2 are fixed around the edge of each hole 6 and have an opening whose edge is inwardly of the periphery of the hole, said female contactors being electrically connected to said first pattern. A male contactor component comprises an insulating substrate having a desired second circuit pattern thereon and a plurality of male contactor pins 1 fixed to the substrate and electrically connected to said second pattern, said pins being located in positions corresponding to the openings of the respec tive female contactors 2 . The female contactors are made of a thin film of a shape memory alloy and the edge of each of the female contactors is given, before insertion of each of the male contactor pin, a shape memory such that the contactor 2 tends to return to a position to close or block the opening when said contactor is subjected to a temperature above the martensitic transition temperature. The pin 3 can thus be inserted at low temperature with little or no force, and yet is firmly gripped in service.
