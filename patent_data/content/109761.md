# Process for the removal of SO2 from gas streams.

## Abstract
The removal of SO₂ from two or more gas streams of differing SO₂ content is accomplished by feeding each of the streams to an absorbent so that the more dilute SO₂ containing stream 10 or streams is supplied to the absor bent upstream from the point at which the more concen trated stream 14 or streams is supplied. By supplying the gas streams to the absorbet flow in ascending order of SO₂ concentration, the amount of SO₂ absorbed by the absorbent flow is increased. A single absorber or a plurality of absorbers may be utilized.
