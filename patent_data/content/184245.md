# Framework for components.

## Abstract
The invention provides a framework having synthetic resin projections 2 6 the framework also serving as a printed circuit board. The invention moreover provides the possibility of making an electrically conductive lead through 14 in a printed circuit board based on a metal mounting plate 11 without an electrically conductive connection with the mounting plate 11 or with other lead throughs being formed.
