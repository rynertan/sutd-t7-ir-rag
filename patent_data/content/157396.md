# POST FORMABLE RADIATION CURING COATINGS

## Abstract
Radiation curable, post formable liquid coating composi tions which cure on radiation exposure to provide coatings which resist exterior exposure are disclosed. These comprise 1. A silicone dicarbinol diurethane diacrylate or dimethacry late in which the carbinol groups are carried by an ethoxylate constituting from 30 to 70 of the silicone dicarbinol 2. A linear dihydroxy functional, C₄ C₈ dicarboxylic acid C₂ C₄ diol polyester diurethane diacrylate or dimethacrylate based on a polyester having an average molecular weight in the range of 600 to 2000 3. Isobornyl acrylate or methacrylate and 4. Acrylic or methacrylic acid. Components 1 and 2 together provide from 30 to 50 of the composition, with component 2 being present in an amount of from 0 to 65 of the total of components 1 and 2, component 3 is present in an amount of at least 30 of the composition and provides coating viscosity, and component 4 is present in an amount of at least 3 of the composition. When acrylic materials are used, and when a photoinitiator is present, ultraviolet radia tion can be used to provide the radiation cure.
