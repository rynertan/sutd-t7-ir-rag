# Shadow mask colour CRT with enhanced resolution and or brightness.

## Abstract
A colour CRT has stripes 10 of different colour light emission phosphors r, g and b deposited on a face plate 8 of the tube with the relative widths of the stripes being inversely proportional to the light emission efficiency of the phosphors. By this means the integrated brigthness of the emitted light from the different phosphor stripes is the same for the same value beam current. By using a novel double shadow mask arrangement, the widths of the beams from the three guns can be made to match, or substantially to match, the widths of the phosphor elements on which they land. Specifically the beam from one gun not shown is aligned with apertures through both masks in order to trans mit a relatively wide portion of the beam onto the least efficient, in this case the red r , phosphor. The portion of the beams transmitted by the first mask 7.1 for the other two guns not shown are further clipped by the relatively off set apertures in the second mask 7.2. This arrangement en ables the advantage of the balanced colour output from the screen to be enjoyed without loss of purity margin and provides a significant increase in brightness for a given beam current and or resolution of the screen. The invention is applicable to CRTs employing shadow masks with slots and phosphor stripes, or holes and phosphor dots and also for CRTs driven in raster scan or vector mode.
