## Description
The present invention relates to a diode attenuator for high frequencies and, more particularly, to an improvement in a voltage controlled diode attenuator. A prior art diode attenuator of the kind described is constructed to apply a predetermined dc bias voltage to a series connection of two diodes via a choke coil, and a variable bias control voltage to one of the diodes via another choke coil. The control voltage is varied to control the attenuation of a high frequency signal which flows through the other of the two diodes. Due to the predetermined voltage applied to between the two diodes, the input impedance of the attenuator advantageously remains constant despite changes in the attenuation of the diode caused by the variable control voltage, as well known in the art. A problem encountered with such a prior art attenuator is that the choke coils included therein make it difficult to set up a wide usable frequency band attenuator or to provide the attenuator in an integrated circuit. Although the use of resistors in place of the choke coils may be contemplated for biasing purpose, it brings about another problem that a change in the control voltage causes voltage drops of the resistors to fluctuate and, thereby, prevents the voltage applied to between the two diodes from setting at a predetermined level, resulting in fluctuation of the input impedance of the attenuator. In United States Patent Specification No. 4,236,126, which issued on November 25 1980, there is described a variable pi RF attenuator which is particularly adapted for construction as a thin film device and wherein the level of a d.c. control voltage is converted into first and second d.c. current sources having magnitudes that vary in opposite directions in response to the control voltage level. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a voltage controlled diode attenuator which, even in an attenuator configuration with biasing resistors, maintains the input impedance constant despite the changes in attenuation. In an embodiment of the invention to be described a voltage controlled diode attenuator comprises first and second diodes connected in series for d.c. current such that their conducting directions are the same a first resistor whose one end is connected to the first diode first means for applying a predetermined dc bias voltage to the first and second diodes connected in series via the first resistor, said first means comprising a differential amplifier having first and second input terminals and an output terminal connected to the other end of the first resistor, a reference voltage source connected to the first input terminal, and negative feedback means for connecting a junction of the first diode and the one end of the first resistor to the second input terminal second means for applying a variable control voltage to the second diode via a second resistor and third means for applying a high frequency signal to a junction of the first and second diodes and deriving it from the one end of the first resistor. Brief Description of the Drawings To facilitate understanding of the present invention, a brief reference will be made to a prior art diode attenuator shown in Fig. 1, which is of the type generally referred to as an inverted L type attenuator. A predetermined dc bias voltage V₁ applied to a terminal 3 is routed to a series connection of diodes e.g. PIN diodes 11 and 12 via a choke coil 21. Meanwhile, a variable bias control voltage V₂ applied to a terminal 4 is fed to the diode 12 via a choke coil 22. A high frequency input signal is applied to an input terminal 2 by way of a coupling capacitor not shown . The input signal is routed through the diode 11 to an output terminal 1 and delivered via another coupling capacitor not shown . The resistance of the diodes 11 and 12 is determined by the dc bias voltage V₁ and the variable bias control voltage V₂ and attenuates the high frequency signal. A characteristic feature of the illustrated prior art attenuator is that, due to the application of the predetermined voltage V₂ to the junction of the two diodes 11 and 12, the input impedance of the attenuator remains unchanged when the attenuation by the diodes is changed in response to the variable control voltage. However, the use of choke coils inherent in the prior art attenuator makes it difficult to offer a wide usable frequency band or to construct the attenuator in an integrated circuit. Concerning a diode attenuator of the type using choke coils, a reference may be made to Viles Need a PIN diode Attenuator An improved circuit provides a constant characteristic impedance, logarithmic control and temperature compensation , ELECTRONICS DESIGN 7, pp. 100 102, March 29, 1977. Where the choke coils shown in Fig. 1 are replaced by biasing resistors, a change in the control voltage causes the voltage drops of the resistors to fluctuate so that the voltage between the diodes fails to be maintained constant. Referring to Fig. 2, an inverted L type diode attenuator in accordance with the present invention is shown. The diode attenuator in Fig. 2 comprises diodes 11 and 12, resistors 31 33, a differential amplifier 40, and a reference voltage source 50. An output terminal 1 is connected to an anode of the diode 11 and one end of each of the resistors 31 and 32. The other end of the resistor 31 is connected to an output of the differential amplifier 40 by way of a control terminal 3. The other end of the resistor 32 is connected to a negative input of the amplifier 40. The positive input of the amplifier 40 is connected to a positive terminal of the reference voltage source 50, while a negative terminal of the reference voltage source 50 is connected to a common potential. Meanwhile, an input terminal 2 is connected to a junction of a cathode of the diode 11 and an anode of the diode 12, while the junction in turn is connected to one end of the resistor 33. The other end of the resistor 33 is connected to a control terminal 4. The cathode of the diode 12 is connected to a common potential ground potential . In operation, when bias voltages applied from the outside to the control terminals 3 and 4 are so adjusted as to render the diode 11 conductive and the diode 12 cutoff, the attenuator sets up the minimum attenuation. It will be seen that during such adjustment of the external bias voltages the input impedance will be held substantially constant if the sum of the bias voltages applied to the diodes 11 and 12 is held constant. In the illustrative embodiment, when a reference voltage Vr is applied from the reference voltage source 50 to the amplifier 40, the output of the amplifier 40 causes a change in the bias voltage applied to the control terminal 3 with the result that the sum of the voltages applied to the diodes 11 and 12 equals the reference voltage Vr. It follows that even if the bias voltage applied to the control terminal 4 is adjusted to vary the current flowing through the diodes 11 and 12 and, thereby, the attenuation of the attenuator, the sum of the voltage drops developing in the diodes 11 and 12 remains unchanged to maintain the input impedance of the attenuator constant. Referring to Fig. 3, another embodiment of the present invention is shown which has a π type diode attenuator construction. As shown, the attenuator additionally includes a circuit similar to the circuit made up of the two diodes 11 and 12 and resistor 33, i.e., a circuit made up of diodes 13 and 14 and a resistor 34, which is connected to the output terminal 1 side. Such a circuit arrangement accomplishes desirable impedance characteristics both in the input and the output. In summary, it will be seen that the present invention provides a voltage controlled diode attenuator which promotes the use of a wide frequency band due to the substitution of resistors for the choke coils particular to the prior art circuitry. In addition, the resistors allow the attenuator to be produced as a compact, integrated circuit. Furthermore, the attenuator of the present invention finds practically unlimited applications because at least the input impedance thereof is not affected by the adjustment of attenuation.
