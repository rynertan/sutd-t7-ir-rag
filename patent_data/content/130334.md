# Process for the preparation of 2 4 hydroxy phenyl 3 methylbutyric acid.

## Abstract
An integrated process for the preparation of 2 4 hy droxyphenyl 3 methylbutyric acid from the corresponding 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methylbutyronitrile through hydrolysis of the nitrile by strong base to the corresponding carboxylic acid followed by formation of the corresponding phenol by nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine with a strong base in the presence of copper salts, and if so desired metallic copper, is described.
