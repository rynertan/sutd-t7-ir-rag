The present invention has made it clear through zoopery that as mentioned above, the compounds I of this invention have extremely strong and long acting antihypertensive effects and some of the compounds reduce or substantially avoid orthostatic hypotension, which is an undesirable side effect accompanying short term blood pressure drop, compared with the conventionally known compounds. The antihypertensive effects of certain compounds of this invention as well as their antihypertensive effects along the passage of time, i.e., their antihypertensive patterns and long acting properties were investigated on spontaneously hypertensive rats SHRs . Investigation results are shown in Table 5. Many of the compounds of this invention showed stronger antihypertensive activity, weaker degrees of blood pressure drop upon an elapsed time of 1 hour after the administration of the drugs, and development of milder antihypertensive effects and longer lasting patterns, all, compared with prazosin employed as Control. Furthermore, the toxicity levels of the compounds of this invention are generally weak. By way of example, their acute toxicity are shown in Table 6. As demonstrated herein, the compounds of this invention are generally believed to serve as drugs which have higher activity and lower toxicity, i.e., higher safety. Hereinafter, biological activities of certain compounds of this invention will be shown in Tests 1 and 2. The antihypertensive effects of the certain compounds of this invention were studied in the following manner. Among male, spontaneously hypertensive rats SHRs of 20 weeks of age or older and 350 430 g heavy all of which had developed hypertension, those having systolic blood pressures of 180 mmHg or higher were used in groups, each of which was constituted of 3 4 of the rats. Blood pressures were measured indirectly in terms of systolic blood pressures at tail arteries by a hemodynamometer W W electronic, BP 8005 under no anesthesia before administration of drugs and upon elapsed time of 1, 3, 6 and 24 hours after the administration. Besides, heart rates were also measured simultaneously. The compounds were each dissolved or suspended in a 0.5 methylcellulose solution and then administered orally. Results are shown in Table 5. The acute toxicity of certain compounds of this invention were studied in the following manner. Namely, male ddy mice of 5 weeks of age and male Wister rats of 8 weeks of age were fasted for 18 hours and used in groups each of which was constituted of 4 5 of the mice or rats. The compounds were each dissolved or suspended in a 0.5 methylcellulose solution and administered orally P.O. . On the fourteenth day after the administration, their toxicity were judged. Results are shown in Table 6. As shown in Table 5, the compounds of this invention exhibited sufficient antihypertensive effects when orally administered at the dosage of 1 mg Kg. The development of their effects were gradual and their maximum effects were observed 6 hours after their administration or even later. In addition, their effects were observed even 24 hours after their administration. They are thus long acting compounds. With respect to heart rate, the degrees of its increases were slight. From these results, many of the compounds of this invention are expected to show higher antihypertensive effects, to develop lower degrees of heart rate increases and to be less susceptible of developing orthostatic hypotension due to short term drop in blood pressure, all, compared with prazosin as Control. These features of the compounds of this invention are believed to make them excellent for the treatment of hypertension of mammals. Moreover, their acute toxicity are weak as shown in Table 6. In view of their amounts to be required to develop their efficacy as drugs, they are considered to be highly safe compounds.
