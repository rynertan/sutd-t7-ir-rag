# A hydraulically operated impact device.

## Abstract
In a hydraulic rock drill the valve 27 is controlled by two control lines 37,42 that each has a plurality of branches with ports 38,41 and 43 46 into the cylinder. A valving pin 48 is slidable in a bore that intersects all the branches 38 41 , 43 46 of both control lines 37,42 and, by axially displacing the pin 48 , the operator can pre select the stroke length and thereby the impact energy per blow.
