## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONCORROSION INHIBITING AZIDkISRE OF AN ORTHOPHOSPHATE COMPOUNDAND A POLYETHER, TOGETHER WITH A PROCESS OF INHIBITING CORROSION.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A variety of compositions have been employed in the art for the purpose of inhibiting corrosion of metal surfaces in water carrying systems. The most common inhibitors include polyphosphates, phosphonates and zinc.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The instant invention is directed to a corrosion inhibiting admixture, comprising A 10 90 , by weight, of a water soluble orthophosphate compound, and B 10 to 90 , by weight, of a polyether. The instant invention is also directed to a method of inhibiting corrosion of steel in an aqueous system, comprising the step of treating the system with at least 0.1 ppm of an admixture comprising A 10 to 90 , by weight, of a water soluble orthophosphate compound and B 10 to 90 , by weight, of a polyether. The water soluble orthophosphate compounds which are operable for the present purposes generally include phosphoric acid, sodium orthophosphates, the potassium orthophosphates, the lithium orthophosphates and ammonium orthophosphates. The following specific compounds may be mentioned as exemplary H3PO4 phosphoric acid, LiH2PO4 lithium diacid phosphate, Na3PO4 trisodium orthophosphate,Na2HPO4 disodium orthophosphate, NaH2PO4 monosodium orthophosphate, NaH5 PO4 2 hemisodium orthophosphate, K3PO4 tripotassium orthophosphate, K2HPO4 dipotassium orthophosphate, KH2PO4 monopotassium orthophosphate, NH4 3PO4 triammonium orthophosphate, NH4 2HP04 diammonium ortho phosphate, and NH4 H2pO4 monoammonium orthophosphate. In addition to the inorganic orthophosphates set forth above may be mentioned the organic phosphates which are set forth in U.S. Patent 3,510,436, which is hereby incorporated by reference. These compounds are excellent sources of orthophosphate. The admixture should contain 10 to 90 , preferably 40 to 60 , by weight, of a water soluble orthophosphate compound and 10 to 90 , preferably 40 to 60 , by weight, of a polyether. Any polyether may be used. Examples include polyalkylene oxide compounds, polyalkylene glycol, polyalkylene glycol acrylate, polyalkylene glycol methacrylate, and mono and di polyalkylene glycol maleate, fumate and itacomate. Also mixtures of polyethers formed from polyethylene oxide with other polyalkylene oxides, such as propylene or butylene oxide may be used. The polyether chain may be capped, with an alkyl, aralkyl, sulfonate or phosphonate group, or uncapped. The polyether preferably should have a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 to 50,000 as determined by light scattering. The polyether may also be copolymerized with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Zinc may also optionally be added to the admixture. The ratio of zinc to the above described admixture should be 10 1 to 10 1. The admixtures are used in a minimum dosage of 0.1 ppm in inhibiting corrosion, preferably in a dosage of 1 to 500 ppm, and most preferably 1 to 200 ppm. EXAMPLES The corrosion rate mils per year was determined for the corrosion inhibitors listed inTable 1 by the following method The electrochemical cell used in these experiments consists of the coupon holder working electrode reference electrode S.C.E. , counterelectrode graphite rods and aerator. Test coupons were presanded to 120 grit and rinsed with acetone before insertion into coupon holders. After the addition of inhibitor to test solutions, pH was adjusted to that of the particular medium under observation. There was no pretreatment of coupons at elevated dosages of inhibitor in any of these tests.Following twenty four hours aeration at 500C, the cell was analyzed electrochemically via potentiodynamic control. Corrosion data are obtained from composite information from two types of tests polarization resistance and Tafel plot. In the polarization resistance procedure, the potential is scanned from 20 to 20 mv of Ecorr the equilibrium potential, at which anodic current density equals cathodic current density, i.e. no net current flow exists . The result is a current density versus potential plot, the slope of which is Rp, or polarization resistance. A Tafel plot is then constructed, scanning the cell potential from Ecorr 200 mv to ECorr 200 mv . The result is a potential versus log current density curve with both anodic and cathodic linear portions.The Tafel constants, ba and bc, are the slopes of the respective linear portions. The three experimental parameters Rp, ba, bc are then substituted into the following equation for corrosion current b . b c 1 icorr 2.3 ba bc Rp Corrosion current is then converted to a corrosion rate by the formula Corrosion icorr . l mole metal .
