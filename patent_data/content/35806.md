## Description
A drive unit for a frontwheel driven car, provided with an infinitely variable belt drive.The invention relates to a drive unit for a frontwheel driven car, provided with a prime mover including a drive shaft, with an infintely variable belt drive comprising a primary driving pulley and a secondary driven pulley, and with a final drive comprising a differential unit and two output shafts being positioned substantially in line in respect of each other.Such a drive unit, the prime mover of which is a combustion engine, is described e.g. in U.S. patent 4,125,037.According to this publication the drive shaft of the prime mover is connected through a hydraulic torque converter to the primary pulley of the infinitely variable belt drive.The secondary pulley is connected through a forward reverse shifting mechanism, a speed reduction mechanism and a differential unit to the two output shafts which drive the wheels of the motor vehicle.Such a drive unit may be designed in various configurations.In the above U.S. patent 4,125,037 the configurations are devided into a U shaped and a Z shaped drive line which may be applied in the motor vehicle in dependence of the available space. A drawback of the prior art drive units of the described type is the relatively large space they occupy, which is in particular detrimental for a universal applicability in several types of vehicles.It is the object of the invention to provide a drive unit of the described type, which is highly compact and hence well applicable in several types of vehicle and due to its compactness is also lighter than the known drive units.To this effect according to the invention, the drive unit is characterized in that the drive shaft of the prime mover is coaxial positioned in respect of the primary pulley and in that the differential unit is coaxial positioned in respect of the secondary pulley so that one of the output shafts is disposed coaxially through the secondary pulle y.This constructive feature results in a compact build up of the drive unit, whereby the entire drive unit substantially comprises two parallel axes that coincide with the axes of the two pulleys. The first axis forms the centerline of at least the drive shaft and the primary pulley and the second axis forms the centerline of at least the secondary pulley, the output shafts and the differential.The possibly other components such as a forward reverse shifting mechanism, a clutch and a reduction mechanism may be applied selectively concentric with one of the two axes.In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, the secondary pulley is connected through a planetary speed reduction mechanism to the differential unit, which speed reduction mechanism is mounted coaxially relative to the output shafts.Such a planetary speed reduction mechanism is known per se, an embodiment of .hich will be further described in the drawing. Furthermore, according to the invention, there may be provided coaxially relative to the primary pulley a reversing mechanism which is connected through a concentric shaft through the primary pulley to the drive shaft and cn the other end is connected to the primary pulley.In such a drive unit for frontwheel driven cars the engine is installed transversely in front of the car. In such a lay out the space available for a transmission is limited and the drive unit according to the invention offers particular advantages due to its compactness.One embodiment of a drive unit for a car according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing.The drive unit comprises a not shown engine and a transmission. The transmission is provided with an engineconnected drive shaft 1, which is connected through a hydraulic coupling 2 and a shaft 3 to a reversing mechanism 4. The reversing mechanism 4 is connected via a hollow shaft 5 mounted coaxially relative to shaft 3 to the primary pulley 6, 13 of a variable belt drive.In this embodiment the reversing mechanism comprises conical gears 7, 8 and 9 and the operation takes place by clutches 10 and 11 which are hydraulically controlled. If clutch 10 is engaged, the carrier 12 of conical gear 8 is fixed relative to conical gear 7, so that the entire conical gear assembly is blocked and the shafts 3 and 5 rotate jointly at equal speed and direction. If, on the other end, clutch 11 is engaged, the carrier of 12 of conical gear 8 is fixed relative to the transmission housing, whereby the shaft 12 of conical gear 8 is stationary and the conical gears 7 and 9, thereby the coaxial shafts 3 and 5 rotate at equal speed but oppositely directed. Thus the belt drive is driven in the forward or reverse direction. The clutches 10 and 11 may also be used for driving off from standstill of the vehicle. In the embodiment shown, however., there is provided therefor a fluid coupling 2.In stead of said fluid coupling, also a different type of clutch e.g. dry or wet plate clutch whether or not operated by centri fugal forces or a hydraulic torque converter may be utilized.The variable belt drive is provided with a primary pulley 6, 13 and a secondary pulley 14, 15, around which the driving belt 16 is applied. The primary pulley comprises a conical sheave 6 affixed to the hollow shaft 5 and a conical sheave 13 which is axially movable under influence of fluid pressure in cylinder space 17. The secondary pulley comprises a conical sheave 14 affixed to the hollow shaft 18 and a conical sheave 15 axially movable under influence of fluid pressure in cylinder space 19. By controlling the fluid flow towards and or the fluid pressure in cylinders 17 and 19, the transmission ratio and the tension of the driving belt can be controlled, as e.g. further explained in U.S. patent 4,152,947.For obtaining the desired speed range of the output shafts 20 and 21, which via flanges 22 and 23 are connected to the wheels of the vehicle, the secondary pulley 14, 15 is connected via hollow shaft 18 to a planetary gear set 24 for driving a differential unit 25. The required reduction of the speed is achieved in that hollow shaft 18 is connected to the sun gear 26 of a first planetary set, whose carrier 32 of planet gears 27 and the planetary gear 28 are connected to respectively the sun gear 29 and the carrier 33 of planet gears 30 of a second planetary set. Of this second planetary set, the planetary gear 31 is fixed in the transmission housir.g and the carrier 33 of planetary gears 39 is connected to the differential unit 25.The planetary gear set 24 drives the differential unit 25 and thereby the output shafts 20 and 21 at a speed reduced relative to the secondary pulley 14, 15. The differential unit 25 is provided in a known manner with conical gears 34, 35, 36.Both the reversing mechanism 7, 8, 9, and the differential unit 34, 35, 36 may be provided inste.ad of with conical gears, also with an epicyclic gear set, in otherwise known manner.
