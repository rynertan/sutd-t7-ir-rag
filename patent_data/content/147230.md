# Subscriber line interface circuit having an impedance synthesizer.

## Abstract
A subscriber line interface circuit discribed wherein a pair of line terminals are connected to a subscriber loop and a pair of output terminals are connected to a telecommunica tion exchange. A first amplifier is provided having a first pair of input terminals coupled to the line terminals and a second pair of input terminals. The first amplifier has a unity gain over a path from the input terminals of the first pair to said output terminals and a gain K over a path from the terminals of the second pair to said output terminals. A pair of reference resistors are cross coupled from said output terminals to the line terminals, each of the reference resistors having a resistance Ro. A second amplifier is connected from the line terminals to the terminals of the second pair, the second amplifier having a transfer function Ro K.Zt, where Zt is an impedance to be synthesized across the line terminals.
