# Carbon cloth supported electrode.

## Abstract
A flow by anode is disclosed made by preparing a liquid suspension of from 8 to 18 by weight solids, the solids comprising from 3.5 to 8 of a powdered catalyst of platinum, palladium, palladium oxide, or mixtures thereof from 60 to 76 carbon powder support having a particle size less than 20 mµm and from 20 to 33 of an inert binder having a particle size of less than 500 mµm. A sufficient amount of the suspension is poured over a carbon cloth to form a layer of solids from 0.01 to 0.05 cm thick on the carbon cloth when the electrode is completed. A vacuum was applied to the opposite side of the carbon cloth to remove the liquid and the catalyst layer cloth assembly is dried and compressed at from 10 to 50 MPa s. The binder is then sintered in an inert atmosphere to complete the electrode. The electrode is used for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide in a sulfur based hybrid cycle for the decomposition of water.
