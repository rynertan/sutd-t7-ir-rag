## Description
This invention relates to semiconductor lasers suitable for use as a light source of a recording and or reproducing apparatus such as an optical video disc or a digital audio disc apparatus. Prior art semiconductor lasers are roughly classified into an index guiding type and a gain guiding type, on the basis of the optical confinement mechanism in the horizontal direction of the hetero junction, or the waveguide mechanism. As an example of a semiconductor laser of index guiding type, a semiconductor laser 10 is shown in schematic enlarged plan view in Figure 1 and in cross sectional view in Figure 2 taken along a line A A in Figure 1. The semiconductor laser 10 is formed such that on a GaAs substrate 1 of N type, a first clad layer 2 made of N type Al An example of a gain guiding semiconductor laser of a planar stripe type is shown in Figure 3. Also in this case, the semiconductor laser is formed such that on the GaAs substrate 1 of, for example, N type, the first clad layer 2 made of N type Al In the prior art semiconductor laser of this kind having such a stripe structure, the width S of the oscillation area of stripe pattern is made uniform throughout each portion as shown in Figure 1. Each of these lasers has an advantage, while neither is free from defects. More particularly, in the index guiding laser, its longitudinal mode is a single mode so that when it is used as a writing recording or reading reproducing light source, for example, for an optical video disc, there is then a defect that it is susceptible to noise caused by return light. On the other hand, since a so called beam waist position, namely, an imaginary light source position exists near the light emission surface of the laser, there is then an advantage that when such a laser is used in practice, the position of a focus can be set with ease. Further, since a far field image, namely, a so called far field pattern in the cross section relative to the direction parallel to the junction is symmetrical with respect to left and right, for example, when such a laser is used in practice as a reading or writing light source which is converged by an optical system such as an objective lens thereby to form a very small beam spot, there is then an advantage that a beam spot having small distortion can easily be obtained. As compared therewith, the imaginary light source position in a gain guiding laser exists on the light end surface of the light emission area regarding the light in the direction perpendicular to the junction, while regarding the light in the direction parallel to the junction, it exists at a position about 20 µm inside the light end surface of the light emission area. Moreover, the far field pattern is asymmetrical with respect to left and right, and the astigmatism is large, so that it is disadvantageous for obtaining a very small beam spot having a small distortion. In this laser, however, the longitudinal mode is a multi mode, resulting in the advantage that noise caused by the return light has less influence, as does mode hopping noise. IEEE J. Quant. Electronics 16 1 , January 1980 discloses a gain guided Planar Stripe with Waist and or Notch SWAN Laser wherein the Stripe geometry consists of a main stripe section with narrower mode control sections near the facets which act as a lossy transverse mode filter. JP A 5373090 discloses a gain guiding laser with a tapered stripe structure having the features of the preamble of claim 1. According to the present invention there is provided a gain guiding semiconductor laser of planar taper stripe structure comprising In embodiments of this invention, a semiconductor laser is formed as a gain guiding type having a stripe structure. On a substrate such as, for example, described in connection with Figure 3, a first clad layer, an active layer, a second clad layer, a capping layer and the like are epitaxially grown in turn. The pattern of an ohmic contact portion of an electrode with the capping layer is formed as a stripe pattern with hatchings as shown by reference numeral 11 in Figure 4. This pattern is formed as a planar taper stripe structure in which the stripe width is S1 at the portion remote from a light end surface 12, and S2 on the light end surface, and also the width of the portion therebetween changes gently. Particularly in the semiconductor laser having such a structure, if the distance of the imaginary source of light propagating parallel to the junction surface from the light end surface 12 is taken as D, a radius of curvature of an equiphase surface of light emitted from the light end surface 12 is taken as R, and a half value width of a near field pattern of light on the light end surface 12 is taken as W then with W as a parameter, D becomes a maximum at a certain value of R, the larger W becomes the larger D becomes, the larger S1 becomes the larger R becomes, and the larger S2 becomes the larger W becomes. Accordingly, in order to make D small, S1 is made large or small taking its maximum value as a limit, S2 is made small, R is made large, and W is made small. Modifications include an electrode stripe type in which the deposition pattern of an electrode is formed as a stripe pattern to concentrate a current, a junction stripe type in which a junction of a stripe pattern is formed by selective ion implantation or selective diffusing of impurity, and a proton irradiation type in which a high resistance region is formed by proton radiation so as to form a current path of stripe pattern. The features of an embodiment of semiconductor laser according to this invention will be understood from the following explanation. That is, a beam emitted from a gain guiding semiconductor laser such as explained with reference to Figure 3 generally has astigmatism. That is, in this semiconductor laser, the beam waist, namely, the imaginary source of the light propagating in the direction perpendicular to the junction exists on the high emission surface the light end surface of the semiconductor laser, while the imaginary source regarding the light propagating in the direction parallel to the junction exists inside the light end surface. If the distance of this imaginary light source from the light end surface is taken as D, then D corresponds to the amount of astigmatism and is given by where W is the half value width l e² of width of the near field pattern at the light end surface, R is the radius of curvature of the equiphase surface of light emitted into the air near and just at the light end surface, and λ is the wavelength of that light. When, on the basis of equation 1 and the half value width W as a parameter, the distance D is plotted by the function of the radius of curvature R, as, for example, shown by curves However, in practice, in the gain guiding semiconductor laser of stripe type, each of the half value width W and the radius of curvature R is dependent on the stripe width S expressed as In a gain guiding laser in which two resonators having the stripe widths S1 and S2 which are different from each other as shown in Figure 4 are arranged in series, the following items were known Then, from the items a and b , the following results were obtained That is, in the case of the semiconductor laser of gain guiding type structure, since the size of the near field pattern is determined by the gain guiding width caused by the current flow in the direction parallel to the junction, namely, the so called lateral direction, the size of the near field pattern tends to become larger than the stripe width. As compared therewith, according to the structure satisfying the above item A , on the point that the near field pattern is small on the basis of a and b and the radius of curvature R of the equiphase surface is large, a result similar to the index guiding type semiconductor laser is obtained. Thus, its astigmatism can be made small, for example, less than 10 µm. According to the semiconductor structure satisfying the above item B , although this is a gain guiding type structure, since the radius of curvature R on the equiphase surface of the light emitted from the light end surface becomes small, its astigmatism D lies within a range of 10 to 15 µm and the deterioration of characteristic, which is the problem inherent in the afore mentioned narrow stripe type semiconductor laser is small, and so this semiconductor laser has good characteristics as the gain guiding type semiconductor laser. This invention is made on the basis of the considerations described in items a and b and these items a and b will be described. In the semiconductor laser of so called taper stripe type in which the stripe width of the oscillation area has the widths S2 and S1 which are respectively different on the light end surface 12 and the portion remote from the light end surface and its width is gently changed therebetween, let it be assumed that within the plane parallel to the junction surface, the extending direction of the stripe is taken as z, the direction perpendicular thereto is taken as x and the direction perpendicular to x and z is taken as y. In this case, it is assumed that the spatial gain distribution depends on x and z. Further, let it be assumed that the source of an electromagnetic wave exists at the centre of the stripe region 11, the stripe width be sufficiently wide and a resultant TE wave generated here is propagated to the taper portion substantially as a plane wave. A wave equation to be solved here is On the basis of these assumptions, let the following equation be considered In the equation 5 , let it be assumed that ψ be expressed as Substituting the equation 5 into the equation 4 yields To solve this equation 8 , if Q kS S is assumed and then substituted into a differential equation regarding Q, the following equation is obtained The solution of this equation 9 is Therefore is obtained. Thus, Q z becomes If, now, a new function q z k Q z is introduced and q ¹ z can be separated into a real number portion and an imaginary number portion, the following equation is established Here, R z becomes the radius of curvature of the equiphase surface of the light at the end in the z direction and W z becomes the beam spot width half value width of the light in the z axis direction. Now, a practical form of q z is searched for and the function on R z and W z is analyzed Comparing these equations 12 and 13 yields In this case, the practical form of α₂ may be assumed, for example, as in which S is the stripe width . Substituting the equation 14 into the equation 10 and obtaining q z is established If, now, is set and the denominator and the numerator of q z of the equation 16 are respectively taken as A and B, which then are calculated As will be understood from a later outlined numerical calculation, since ϑ 1 can be satisfied, the above A and B can be simplified as follows Then, if q Therefore are obtained. Subsequently, the effective distance D of the beam waist position, namely, the imaginary light source position from the light end surface will be considered. Upon considering this distance D, a corresponding relation between a position at which the minimum value of the beam spot size within a practical cavity resonator is given and a position given by the measurement will be considered. If the half value width W of the near field pattern on the light end surface and its emitting angle ϑ are given, the astigmatism of the semiconductor laser can be determined uniquely by a model in which α Gaussian beam can be propagated in a free space, and the astigmatism does not depend on the waveguide mechanism within the cavity resonator. Accordingly, even in, for example, a weak index guiding type semiconductor laser, or a semiconductor laser in which the radius of curvature R on the equiphase surface of light emitted therefrom is finite, it is naturally expected that the imaginary light source distance D can be measured by the half value width W of the near field pattern and its emitting angle ϑ. Further, it is experimentally clear that the imaginary light source distance D of a generally obtainable index guiding semiconductor laser at present has an astigmatism ranging from 4 to 8 µm. That is, the fact that the astigmatism of the index guiding type semiconductor laser is small as compared with that of the gain guiding type semiconductor laser is due to the fact that the spot width half value width of the near field pattern in the index guiding type laser is smaller than that of the gain guiding type laser. Further, the above fact can easily be understood from the following fact that the beam waist position in the direction perpendicular to the junction, namely, in the longitudinal direction exists on substantially the light end surface position, the half value width in this direction is about 0.3 µm and is very small as compared with that in the direction parallel to the junction, namely, the lateral direction and as compared with a difference of a refractive index regarding the lateral direction, a difference of a refractive index regarding the longitudinal direction being sufficiently large. Then, how the waveguide mechanism of each semiconductor laser participates in the beam waist is made clear pratically by solving the wave equation corresponding to each waveguiding mechanism and the half value width W of the beam spot on the light end surface and the radius of curvature R of the equiphase surface of the light are independently determined. When the width W of the beam spot size on the light end surface and the radius of curvature R of the equiphase surface of light at the front end are determined as mentioned above, the emitting angle ϑ of the light is determined by an equation given as From the above considerations, it can be understood that if the waveguide mechanism is given once and the electrode stripe pattern is given, the distance D is determined uniquely. The above analysis clarifies for the first time the corresponding relation between the practical distribution of the light or the TE wave within the cavity resonator and the effective astigmatism produced by the measurement. In the semiconductor laser of taper stripe type determined on the basis of the above analysis, or the semiconductor laser in which as shown in Figure 4, the stripe width is S1 at the central portion and S2 at the light end surface 12 and the width is gradually changed between the portion having the width S1 and the portion having the width S2 by the taper 13, the calculated results regarding the relation between the S1 determined when S2 3 µm is established and the light source distance D are shown by marks in Figure 6. In the figure, a mark x indicates the calculated result of a semiconductor laser having the prior art structure in which the stripe width is selected to be the uniform width S1. In this case, qp α 100 cm ¹ and δ Δn Considering the item ii , it is easily confirmed that the light source distance D can be described by the half value width W on the light end surface and the radius of curvature R as in the following equation A relation between R n and D expressed by the equation 1 becomes the curve shown in Figure 5 and it is understood from this that D is decreased as R is decreased under the condition of I R n λ πW², while D is decreased as R is increased under the condition of II R n λ πW². These facts correspond to the afore mentioned items I and II . From the analyses as mentioned above, it is understood that in the taper stripe structure, if the taper length L is properly designed, it is possible to obtain a gain guiding type semiconductor laser having astigmatism of D 10 µm. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like parts, and in which As shown in Figure 7, similarly to the manner explained in connection with Figure 3, respective semiconductive layers are epitaxially grown in turn on a GaAs substrate 1 by epitaxial method, for example, a vapour growth method using thermal decomposition. Explanation of parts in Figure 7 corresponding to those in Figure 3 will be omitted. In this case, the pattern of the portion in which the electrode 8 is deposited in ohmic contact with the capping layer 5, or the pattern of the electrode window 7a of the insulating layer 7 is formed such that as shown in Figure 8, the width of the central portion is selected to be S1, the width on the end surface 12 is selected to be S2 and both of them are connected straight together by a taper portion 13. When the length of this taper portion 13 is taken as L, S1 8 µm, S2 3 µm, the full length of the stripe was selected to be 250 µm and the length of the portion having the width S2 was selected to be 10 µm, planar stripe type lasers were formed in which L was respectively selected to be 10 µm, 20 µm, 40 µm, 80 µm and 125 µm. Semiconductor lasers were formed which have a similar structure to Example 1, but S1 6 µm, S2 3 µm and the full length of the stripe pattern was selected to be 250 µm, and in which L was similarly selected to be 10 µm, 20 µm, 40 µm and 80 µm, respectively. A semiconductor laser was formed to have a similar structure to Example 1 in which S1 20 µm, S2 3 µm, the full length of the stripe was selected to be 250 µm and L was selected to be 80 µm. With all the Examples, semiconductor lasers were formed which were superior in threshold current, astigmatism, far field pattern, life time and the like. Further, when the relation between the astigmatism D and the length L was measured, the results as shown in Figure 9 were obtained. According to the measured results, it is clear that L is preferably 100 µm to reduce the astigmatism. Furthermore, in the embodiments, it was confirmed that the threshold value current density threshold value current electrode area is decreased with the result that in the life time test, the deterioration ratio is decreased more than that of the ordinary semiconductor laser having the uniform stripe width of 5 µm. The taper portion 13 can be formed as a straight line, parabola, hyperbola and the like, and the stripe portion 11 and the taper portion 13 can be connected smoothly. Further, the end portion of the taper portion 13 may have a portion with a uniform width. While in the above examples the portion having the uniform width S1 and the portion having the different but uniform width S2 are coupled together by the taper portion 13, it is possible that as shown in Figure 10, the stripe portion 11 is formed as, for example, a zigzag pattern and the envelope of the pattern forms a taper portion.
