# Receiver devices in satellite communication systems.

## Abstract
A receiver device for a satellite communication system capable of transmitting in either of two modes detects which transmission mode is currently in effect and adjusts its signal processing and output stages accordingly. The transmission may be recognized by reference to either the encoded informa tion of the eletromagnetic medium itself of the received elec tromagnetic transmissions. In one mode, only signals and relat ed information are broadcast in frequency modulated form whereas in the other mode, a video image signal is also in cluded, while a sub carrier signal is modulated by an audio and or data signal. The receiver system checks either the sub carrier signal or video synchronization signals in the incoming transmisslon to determine the transmission mode. The receiver may also be forced to a predetermined mode upon power switch on, to prevent spurious mode selection errors.
