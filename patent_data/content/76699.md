# Precollation copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A precollation copying apparatus with a recirculating document handler RDH 12 in which a set of original document sheets 16 is placed and normally plurally recirculated and copies once per circulation at the copier imaging station 14 to produce a selected plural number of precollated copy sheet sets therefrom in a normal copy sheet output path 36 or 40 . A selectable alternative copy sheet path 44 is provided for feeding copy cheets from said normal copy sheet output path 36 or 40 of said copier into an input station of said RDH 12 with a selectably actuatable copy sheet output path deflector 32 diverting a first set of copy sheets 18 made from original document sheets 16 into said alternative copy sheet path 44. The RDH 12 automatically ejects the original document sheets 16 without circulating them after they have been copied only once, and then the RDH automatically plurally recirculates the set of copy sheets 18 in lieu of and as if they were original document sheets to copy the remainder of the selected number of copy sets from those copy sheets rather than original document sheets.
