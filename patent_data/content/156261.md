## Description
The present invention relates to the use of optical indicator compounds which provide optical signals upon contact with oxidants, particularly hydrogen peroxide. In particular, the invention relates to the use of fluorogenic indicators for hydrogen peroxide in analytical systems, such as diagnostic test systems, which are based on the generation and detection of hydrogen peroxide in response to the analyte under determination. Many analytical systems involve the measurement of an oxidative substance as the ultimately detected substance. The analyte under determination may itself be such oxidant or the analyte may participate in a chemical, biological, immunological, or the like reaction that produces or destroys a measurable oxidant. These oxidants include substances such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, periodates, peracids, and superoxides. In particular, the determination of oxidative enzyme activity is important in analytical chemistry and biochemistry because of its usefulness in clinical diagnostic systems. Among the more commonly studied oxidative enzymes are the oxidases which produce hydrogen peroxide, such as glucose oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and cholesterol oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide generated by the action of such enzymes on their substrates is generally quantitated by oxidation reduction reactions with various types of optical indicators, usually in the presence of peroxidase. One of the most sensitive means for quantitating hydrogen peroxide is by the use of fluorogenic peroxidase substrates which yield fluorescent products upon peroxidase catalyzed reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The literature contains relatively few examples of fluorogenic peroxidase substrates. Some such indicators that have been reported in the literature are homovanillic acid, 3 European Patent Application number 84 102 280.9 concerns optical indicator chalcogen selenide or sulfide compounds responsive to oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. Upon oxidation the resulting intermediate undergoes spontaneous elimination of the chalcogen residue to yield a signal compound providing an optical signal such as fluorescence. Preferred indicators are 3 chalcogen 3, 4 dihydrocoumarins and 3 chalcogen 3,4 dihydro 2 quinolones. J. Heterocyclic Chem., Volume 20, 1983, pages 493 494, J. of the Chem. Society, 1969, pages 1749 1751, Chem. Abs., Volume 74, 1971, Nr. 99791w, J. of the Chem. Society, 1969, pages 183 188, Chem. Abs., Volume 87, 1977, No. 68181m and European Patent 121 743 are dealing with compounds like those which are described herein. But all of the citations are silent with regard to the use as indicators. The present invention provides a novel use for a class of fluorogenic indicator compounds responsive to hydrogen peroxide. Upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, preferably in the presence of a peroxidatively active substance such as peroxidase, the present, substantially nonfluorescent compounds yield highly fluorescent reaction products. Therefore, the present invention provides highly sensitive indicators for the detection of hydrogen peroxide and for use in analytical systems wherein hydrogen peroxide is generated or consumed as a function of the presence of an analyte of interest. The present compounds are 3,4 dihydroquinolones and 3,4 dihydrocoumarins principally of the general formula wherein Z is either R¹ is hydrogen or alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, heterocyclic aryl of which any can be substituted by hydroxyl, halo, amino, cyano, nitro, thiol, carboxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyl, and aryl or R¹ is cyano, carboxyl, carboalkoxy, carboaryloxy, carboxamide, sulfonyl, sulfoxy, sulfonium, phosphonyl, phosphonium, halo, or nitro. R² is hydroxyl or NR³R⁴ where R³ and R⁴, which can be the same or different, are hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl of which any can be substituted by hydroxyl, halo, amino, cyano, nitro, thiol, carboxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyl, and aryl and Y is 0 or N R⁵ where R⁵ is hydrogen or C₁ C₆ alkyl which can be substituted by hydroxyl, halo, amino, cyano, nitro, thiol, carboxyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyl, and aryl for the analytical determination of hydrogen peroxide. Upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a peroxidatively active substance, a double bond is generated between the 3 and 4 positions yielding a fluorescent product. The process by which the double bond is introduced is believed to follow the series of steps depicted in Fig. 1 of the drawings. The initial step is believed to be a first oxidation of the heteroatom at the 7 position the R² substituent to a radical cation wherein R¹, R², and Y are as described above. Particularly preferred indicator compounds are the 7 dialkylamino derivatives of formula The fluorogenic indicator compounds of the present invention have particularly advantageous features. The indicator compounds are essentially nonfluorescent, react quickly with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a peroxidatively active substance such as peroxidase, are nonreactive with peroxidase alone, and are not interfered with by protein binding. The signal compounds produced upon oxidation are highly fluorescent, have excitation and emission wavelengths above that for background protein fluorescence e.g., above 390 nm , do not form interfering side products, are stable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and peroxidatively active substances, and do not exhibit interfering protein binding. Figs. 1 and 2 are proposed reaction mechanisms for oxidation of the present compounds generally and the preferred dialkylamino derivatives, respectively, as discussed above. Figs. 3 6 are flow diagrams of particular synthetic paths for preparing indicator compounds of the present invention. As used herein, alkyl is intended to include aliphatic and cyclic organic residues having a carbon atom at the point of attachment which is bonded to one or more hydrogens or one or more carbons or heterocyclic atoms e.g., nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur by single bonds. Accordingly, alkyl groups include the unsubstituted hydrocarbon residues of the formula C Aryl , as used herein, is intended to include organic residues derived from an aromatic hydrocarbon or heterocyclic ring or ring system by removal of a hydrogen atom. Accordingly, aryl groups include the unsubstituted hydrocarbon ring residues such as phenyl and naphthyl, and substituted forms thereof. Heterocyclic aryl residues are those comprising one or more heteroatoms e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur in their ring structure, such as pyridyl, triazoyl, furanyl, imidazolyl, quinolinyl, thiophenyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, and pyrimidinyl, and substituted forms thereof. It is understood for the purposes of this invention that aryl residues include those bearing one or more, same or different, functional groups or substituents, as discussed in detail below, which are selected so as not to substantially negate the novel features of the present compounds. Further, alkenyl includes alkyl groups as defined above wherein at least one C C single bond is replaced with a C C double bond, and therefore include the unsubstituted lower alkenyls, e.g., vinyl, 1 propenyl, 2 propenyl, and so forth, as well as substituted forms thereof. Alkoxy and aryloxy intend ether linked alkyl and aryl groups, respectively, as defined above e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, phenoxy . Carboalkoxy and carboaryloxy intend carboxyl ester linked alkyl and aryl groups, respectively, as defined above e.g., acetyl, carbethoxy, benzoyloxy . Carboxamide intends unsubstituted and mono or di N substituted amido groups. In the context of the present invention, used herein, an indication that a particular group e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and the like is substituted is intended to include such groups when mono or polysubstituted with functional groups which do not substantially negate the novel features of the present compounds. Such functional groups include essentially all chemical groups which can be introduced synthetically and result in stable indicator compounds. Examples of functional groups are hydroxyl, halo e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo , amino including substituted amino such as alkylamino and dialkylamino , cyano, nitro, thiol, carboxyl including substituted carboxyl such as substituted and unsubstituted esters carboalkoxy and carboaryloxy and carboxamides , alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyl, and aryl. In general, the fluorogenic indicator compounds of the present invention are characterized by having substantially no fluorescent properties or having fluorescent properties, e.g., excitation and or emission spectra, substantially different from the fluorescent quinoline and coumarin products The present invention will now be illustrated by particular description of preferred fluorogenic indicators for hydrogen peroxide and their preparation and use. Such indicators have the structure of formula Particularly preferred indicators are the 7 dialkylamino 2 quinolones of the formula wherein R³ and R⁴ are alkyl, preferably lower alkyl, and can be prepared by reduction such as with sodium borohydride, of the corresponding known quinolones German OLS 2,363,459 . The ring nitrogen bearing the R⁵ substituent can be alkylated, if desired, with sodium hydride, followed by an alkyl halide to yield, after reduction, N substituted dihydroquinolones. Preferably, R⁵ will be hydrogen or lower alkyl, particularly methyl. The R¹, substituents can vary widely within the groupings previously described by appropriate selection of the starting quinolone. The dihydroquinolones wherein R⁷ is alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl, and preferably is lower alkyl see Fig. 3 . Such cinnamic diesters are prepared by reaction of a 4 disubstituted amino 2 nitrobenzaldehyde German Pat. 2,363,458 with an appropriate dialkyl , dialkenyl, or diaryl malonate. The double bond in the cinnamic diester Fluorogenic coumarin indicators which upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide yield the fluorescent coumarins of the formula by reintroduction of the 3,4 double bond as described previously. The R¹ substituent can vary widely within the groupings previously described. A wide variety of 3 substituted coumarins formula Where Y is oxygen and R² is NR³R⁴, fluorogenic indicators such indicators where R³ R⁴ hydrogen can be obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of the 7 amino or 7 nitrocoumarins. If 7 alkylamino or dialkylamino 3,4 dihydrocoumarins are desired, they can be prepared by N alkylation of a 7 aminodihydrocoumarin or catalytic hydrogenation of a Schiff base of a 7 aminodihydrocoumarin. Alternatively, the N alkylaminocoumarin can be prepared using the appropriate 3 alkylaminophenol or 3 dialkylaminophenol as the starting material by the methods described below. The fluorescent species produced upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide has the formula 3 Substituted 7 aminocoumarins can be obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of a 4 amino 2 hydroxy or 2 O protected benzaldehydes W.E. Solodar, Fluorogenic indicators The hydroxyl group is protected in an appropriate manner such as by conversion to its 2 tetrahydropyranyl ether see compound The R¹ substituent can vary widely within the groupings previously described. Reaction of the lactam with a strong base followed by an acylating agent such as diethyl carbonate will introduce a 3 carbethoxy substituent which can be further elaborated to a variety of 3 substituted dihydroquinolones as described previously. Also, the 7 hydroxyl group can be replaced with 7 lower alkyl amino substituents, with various derivatives being known N.Shigematsu, With reference to formula It is evident that the 4 , 5 , 6 and 8 positions on the quinolone and coumarin nucleus of the present compounds can bear a variety of substituents without departing from the inventive features of the present indicators. Such substituted forms of the present compounds shall be considered to be equivalents of the present 3,4 dihydro indicators. One can select essentially any fluorescent quinolone or coumarin, or a quinolone or coumarin providing another useful optical property such as absorbance, and reduce the 3,4 double bond as described herein to yield useful indicator compounds as the formula wherein R¹, R², and Y are as described above, R⁸ and R⁹ are essentially any desired substituent groups, and The R⁹ substituents can be selected from those known to exist in coumarins and 2 quinolones found in nature or capable of being synthesized to give fluorogenic indicators. The R⁹ substituents, if present, i.e., where In addition, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and aryl rings can be annelated to the phenyl ring to yield equivalent substituted indicator compounds, particularly where annelation occurs through the R² substituent. For example, where R² is nitrogen, one or two R⁹ substituents can occupy one or both of the positions adjacent to the R² substituent and can be a linear butylene radical forming with R² nitrogen, one or two tetrahydropyridinyl rings annelated to the phenyl ring Fig. 6 . A preferred subset of fluorogenic indicators of hydrogen peroxide are those of the formula wherein R¹ is hydrogen, cyano, or is of the formula COOR⁶, CONHR⁶, or CON R⁶ ₂ where R⁶ is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl R² is OH or NR³R⁴ where R³ and R⁴, which can be the same or different, are hydrogen or lower alkyl and Y is O or N R⁵ where R⁵ is hydrogen or lower alkyl. The present invention provides particularly advantageous hydrogen peroxide sensitive indicators for use in analytical systems in the diagnostic field. Numerous diagnostic test systems are known which are based ultimately on the determination of hydrogen peroxide. For example, there are the determinations of various analytes such as glucose, galactose, cholesterol, and uric acid, based on the action of specific oxidase enzymes e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, uricase . Similarly, there are enzymatic test systems in which the analyte is reacted enzymatically or nonenzymatically to produce a product which in turn is reacted in one or more enzymatic or nonenzymatic steps to yield ultimately hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the present indicators are applicable to specific binding assays such as immunoassays in which a labeling substance is used which is detectable by generation of hydrogen peroxide. Such binding assay systems include those in which the label is an oxidase enzyme or an enzyme which produces a product which is then acted on enzymatically or nonenzymatically to yield hydrogen peroxide. Examples of such systems are the heterogeneous and homogeneous enzyme labeled immunoassays described in the literature such as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,654,090 and 3,817,837. Alternatively, the label can be a substrate, an inhibitor, a coenzyme, or a prosthetic group for such an enzyme, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,279,992 4,238,565 4,134,792 and 4,273,866 and in U.K. Pat. Spec. 1,552,607. It is preferred that the test sample or reaction mixture containing hydrogen peroxide to be determined with the present indicator compounds also be contacted with a peroxidatively active substance as is known in the field. Plant peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase or potato peroxidase, can be used. Inorganic compounds having peroxidase activity include iodides, such as sodium and ammonium iodides, and molybdates. In addition, urohemin and a number of other porphyrin substances having peroxidative activity can be used. The present invention will now be illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by the following examples.
