## Description
The present invention relates to a device for applying load magnetically to a rotating shaft in a pedal operated exercise apparatus. It is necessary for a load applying device to apply continually an arbitrary load brake torque to a rotating shaft of an apparatus which receives the load and therefore an excellent durability is required for such a load applying device. Such a load applying device will be described in the following, which load applying device is used in an ergometer a training apparatus of pedal type including a load applying device . One of the objects of the invention is that load to be applied to an object, namely, brake torque can be set to an arbitrary fixed value, irrespectively of the rotation speed of the object. One reason for this is that in the case of an ergometer, calculation of the kinetic amount of a person exercising using the ergometer cannot be made correctly as desired if the brake torque of a load applying device changes dependent on the rotation speed of the pedals, thus making the ergometer perform its function unsatisfactorily. US A 4 358 105 discloses a device for applying load to a rotatable load shaft in a pedal operated exercise apparatus, comprising a crank shaft through which pedal load applied by on exercising operator is transmitted, a speed increasing mechanism in association with the crankshaft and the load shaft, for causing the load shaft to rotate at a higher speed than the crankshaft, and means, constituted by an alternator, for applying brake torque to the load shaft. In use, the brake torque varies and a substantially constant work level, irrespective of the rotational speed of the crank shaft, is maintained. The present invention provides a device for applying load to a load shaft in pedal operated exercise apparatus, comprising Since, in use of the device when the disc rotates, a closed magnetic path is formed by the rotating disc and the electromagnet facing both sides of the rotating disc, eddy current is generated efficiently in the rotating disc. Further, since the rotation speed of the load shaft is set to a value higher than a prescribed rotation speed, brake torque applied to the rotating disc by the eddy current generated in the disc functions in a saturated region. Therefore, stable brake torque is applied irrespective of the rotation speed of the load shaft. As described in the foregoing, the present invention makes it possible to generate eddy current efficiently in the rotating disc and to obtain intense brake torque with the small sized electromagnet since the electromagnet is disposed in a manner where the main surfaces of the rotating disc are inserted therein. Further, in a preferred structure, only one electromagnet, and therefore only one coil as the exciting coil are needed and accordingly, brake torque can be easily regulated by the current control. Brake torque is maintained constant with the rotation speed of the crankshaft by the pedals being in a practically applicable range in the speed increasing mechanism and as a result, the same load as if in the case of riding on a bicycle on the flat ground can be applied to the user and he will have a comfortable feeling at the time of using the exercise apparatus. Further, the kinetic amount work amount of the user, which is represented by the product of the revolutions per minutes of the crankshaft and the brake torque, can be calculated easily since the brake torque is constant. In addition, since the brake torque can be set to an arbitrary fixed value, the present invention makes it possible to provide a device by which the user can exercise according to his physical strength. The invention is further described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following, a concrete embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, taking an example of a load applying device used in a pedal operated exercise apparatus. Fig. 2 is a view showing a total structure of the exercise apparatus where an embodiment of the present invention is adopted. A frame 1 made of a construction material comprises at least a base 2 and a front and a back stays 3 and 4 both having variable height. An upper end of the front stay comprises a handle 5 having a loop shape as a plane figure for example and a control panel 6. The control panel 6 is provided with a keyboard for regulating brake torque and the like to be applied to the load shaft, a display for displaying the running distance and other components, as described later. An upper end of the back stay 4 comprises a saddle 7. On the base 2, a load applying device 8 is provided The load applying device 8 comprises a crankshaft 10 attached to the back stay 4 having pedals 9 and a load shaft 12 supported by a support frame 11 on the base 2. The crankshaft 10 and the load shaft 12 are coupled by a speed increasing mechanism 13 having two speed increase stages. The construction of the load applying device 8 excluding the pedals is usually protected by a cover 14 shown by the chained line for the purpose of preventing clothes etc. of a user from being caught in the device or for the purpose of protection from dust. Fig. 1 and 3 are views showing an essential part of the load applying device 8. First referring to Fig. 3, the speed increasing mechanism 13 comprises a first speed increase stage including a crank wheel 15 of a large diameter fixed to the crankshaft 10, a wheel 17 of a small diameter fixed to an intermediate shaft 16 rotatably held by the support frame 11 and a chain 18 set on the two wheels and a second speed increase stage including a pulley 19 of a large diameter fixed to the intermediate shaft 16, a pulley 20 of a small diameter fixed to the load shaft 12 and a timing belt 21 set on the two pulleys. Thus, the speed increasing mechanism is so structured that a speed increase ratio of the mechanism 13, namely a speed increase ratio between the crankshaft 10 and the load shaft 12 can be set to a large value. In Fig. 3, the reference numeral 22 indicates a tension pulley for tightening the timing belt 21 and the reference numeral 23 indicates a derailer for tightening the chain 18. In this embodiment, the speed increase ratio is set to 16.6. Although in this embodiment, the speed increasing mechanism 13 is structured by the wheels and the chain set therebetween as well as by the pulleys and the timing belt set therebetween, it may be structured by combination of only the wheels and the chains or only the pulleys and the timing belts. In addition, the speed increasing mechanism 13 may be structured by combination of gears. Further, the speed increasing mechanism 13 may be structured with any number of speed increase stages, say, a single stage or three or more stages, the number being not limited to two as mentioned above, insofar as the rotation speed of the crankshaft 10 is increased and transmitted to the load shaft 12 and the rotation speed of the load shaft 12 can be made higher than a prescribed rotation speed an example of a concrete value thereof being mentioned later with the rotation speed of the crankshaft 10 being in the range of a practically applicable speed an example of a concrete value thereof being mentioned later . Now referring to Figs. 1 and 3, around a wheel 24 fixed to the load shaft 12, a circular disk 25 made of a copper plate for example is fixed so that the disk 25 and the wheel 24 form one body to have an increased diameter. In addition, in order to make smooth the rotation of the disk 25 and the rotation of the wheel 24, a circular weight ring 26 functioning as a fly wheel is attached for example in a portion of coupling between the wheel 24 and the disk 25. As a result, the disk 25 and the load shaft 12 can rotate smoothly and the structure can be made simpler than in the case of providing a fly wheel for that purpose. In association with the disk 25, a single electromagnet 27 is provided in a manner fixed to the support frame 11. The electromagnet 27 comprises a core 28 and an exciting coil 29 wound onto the core 28 on a coil bobbin not shown. The core 28 in this embodiment have a form of the letter C opened at one point so that the two main surfaces of the disc are interposed in the opening between the end surfaces of the core, but are not in touch with the end surfaces. As the core 28, a cut core having a single cut on multiple turns of a band steel is preferably used. This is because a cut core,even if of a small size, has a high density of magnetic flux and is capable of generating a larger quantity of eddy current in the disc 25 as compared with an ordinary multi layer core and accordingly brake torque applied to the disc 25 can be substantially increased. Although in this embodiment, only one electromagnet 27 is used, it goes without saying that a structure having two or more electromagnets may be adopted in cases where more intense brake torque is required. The structure of the electromagnet 27 is not limited to that in this embodiment. For example, the following structure may be adopted. A set of two electromagnets each comprising a column like core and an exciting coil wound on the core may be used so that the electromagnets may be disposed on both sides of the disc 25. In sum, as far as both surfaces of the disc 25 are placed in an intermediate space provided in one or more electromagnets in the state where the surfaces of the disc 25 are not in contact with the electromagnets, any form or any structure may be adopted for the electromagnets. One end of the exciting coil 29 is connected to a DC power source V Setting of the current flowing in the exciting coil 29 is made in the below described manner by means of a keyboard 33, a CPU 34, a display 35 and a D A converter 36 provided in the control panel 6 see Fig. 2 . The user enters desired brake torque namely, load of the ergometer according to his own physical strength by means of the keyboard 33. The entered brake torque is displayed on the display 35 through the CPU 34 to be ascertained by the user. When the brake torque is determined, the CPU 34 calculates exciting current necessary for applying the brake torque. This calculation of the exciting current value is performed based on the relation More preferably, the CPU 34 has a further function of calculating the kinetic amount of the user so that the kinetic amount is represented on the display 35. An example of the eddy current load characteristics in a relation between the disc 25 and the exciting coil 28 is as shown in Fig. 4. The characteristic curve in Fig. 4 is obtained as a result of measurement under the conditions set as follows Accordingly, in this embodiment, brake torque can be set to an arbitrary fixed value by making regulation finely or without grades in the range of the rotation speed of the disc 25 of 830 to 1660 rpm, in other words, in the range for practically using pedals. Thus, the kinetic amount of the user can easily be calculated. Further, in this embodiment, a plurality of sheets of fins 37 are formed in positions on the main surface of the disc 25, not interfering with the electromagnet 27, namely, on the main surface of the disc near the circumference of the wheel 24. The fins 37 may be formed radially in circles on the main surface of the disc 25, each in a curved shape a concave shape as viewed from one side and a convex shape as viewed from the other side or may be in the form in which metallic materials are soldered or attached by any other means onto the surface of the disc 25. Otherwise, the fins 37 may be structured as slits partially provided in the disc 25, or as rectangular projections diametrically provided on the main surface of the disc 25, each being cut and raised from the disc 25 except one side. These fins 37 serve for ventilation of the disc 25 or for radiation of joule heat caused by the eddy current transmitted from the disc 25 so that the temperature on the surfaces of the disc 25 may be maintained in the vicinity of the normal temperature 15 to 18 C in the embodiment to prevent the brake torque from being lowered by increase of the temperature.
