# Hybrid DNA synthesis of mature insulin like growth factors.

## Abstract
Methods and compositions are provided for efficient production of human insulin like growth factor. Synthetic IGF I and IGF II genes are joined to leader and processing signals which provide for expression and secretion of the gene pro duct in yeast. Enhanced yields of the product may then be recovered from the nutrient medium. Yeast strains S. cerevisiae AB103 pYIGF I 10 1 and AB103 pYIGF II 10 1 were deposited at the American Type Culture Collection on April 23, 1983 and granted Accession Nos. 20673 and 20674, respectively.
