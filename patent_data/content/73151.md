# Method of moulding a blow moulded bottle shaped container.

## Abstract
A hollow blow molded bottle shaped container of a biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate which advan tageously has a crystallized outer peripheral portion at the neck portion except the boundary between the neck portion and the body portion and non crystallized inner peripheral portion thereat. This bottle shaped container is molded by a method of molding the same, which method advantageously has the steps of injection molding a piece or parison formed at the outer peripheral surface of a neck root part forming portion in a downwardly flared tapered shape, and crystalliz ing by a heat treatment the outer peripheral surface portion of the neck root part forming portion except the entire area of the neck portion forming portion and the boundary portion therebetween. Thus, deterioration in the physical prop erties of the neck and shoulder portions of the bottle shaped container thus finally blow molded can be reduced.
