# Improved can clip and multiple container package.

## Abstract
A clip 10 is capable of securely holding cans to form a multiple can package and allowing ease of disengagement and relative bending of adjacent cans in directions parallel to the multiple container package. The clip 10 is designed to engage cans having a wide range of counter sink depths by providing an ear 12 having a guiding portion 14 with sufficient flexibility to conform to the top portion of the can. A hook portion 20 of the clip is designed to securely engage the chime portion of the can while uniform support is provided by a concentric support wall 22 , to maintain engagement of the can in a secure manner with increased holding ability. A rib structure extends into the ear portion 12 to provide additional support. Flange means 24 limit movement of discrete body portions of the clip 10 to allow ease in disengagement in response to radial diagonal movement of cans during disengagement.
