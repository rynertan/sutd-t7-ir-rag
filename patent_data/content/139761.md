# METHOD OF SPECIFYING A MACHINING REGION FOR AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMING.

## Abstract
A method of specifying a machining region for automatic programming, wherein part of a path to be machined is specified within a closed path, comprises the steps of display ing the locus of a closed path constituted by a plurality of path blocks b₁,b₂...b₁₆ on a display screen 105 using path data which is already prepared, indicating and inputting first and second points P₅, P₁₂ on the closed path with a cursor CSR , indicating with the cursor a point P₆ within a first path part P₅ P₆ ... P₁₂ between the first and second points and a point P₁₃ within a second path part P₁₂ P₁₃ ... P , and specifying a region to be machined by actuating a machining region input switch when the first path part is indicated by the cursor when the first path part is to be machined, and when the second path part is indicated by the cursor when the second passage part is to be machined.
