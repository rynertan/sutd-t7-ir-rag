# IMPROVED HARNESS RESTRAINT SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved harness restraint system for a vehicle seat occupant which includes a unique single point release device having laterally spaced connectors for attachment of shoulder harness straps. The system also includes an improved harness belt system employing a cross chest belt configuration as well as a gross adjustment feature for pre adjusting the harness assembly straps to substantially approximate the occupant. The new system also provides diverging lower restraint belts which encircle each leg of the occupant for anti gravity and crash restraint. The single point release device also includes an automatic release mechanism which is activated in a water environment.
