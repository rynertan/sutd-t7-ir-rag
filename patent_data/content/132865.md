## Description
AL NA NALO ZNATED AROMATIC COMPOUNDS AS PRO00lNITIATORS Field of the Invention The present invention relates to processes and compositions for photopolymerization using certain alpha hal ogena ted aromatic compounds as photoinitiators.Background of the Invention Photopolymerization of unsaturated compositions in which a photoinitiating compound is included in the polymerizable mass is well known in the art. The process has many advantages over thermal polymerization and is particularly useful where long shelf life combined with rapid hardening at low temperature is desirable. Photoinitiating compounds must absorb light and utilize the energy so acquired to initiate polymerization. A large number of compounds have been found useful as photoinitiators for the polymerization of unsaturated compounds. Among those heretofore in most common usage in industry are the benzoin ethers of primary and secondary alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol. Also, compounds such as phenyl glyoxal and l phenyl butane 1, 2 dione are disclosed as photosensitizers in U. S.Patent No. 2,413,973. Additionally, various acetophenone compounds such as 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone are claimed to have photoinitiating capability in U. S.Patent No. 3,715,293. Certain specific alpha chlorinated aromatic compounds have been suggested as photoinitiators.U. S. Patent No. 2,505,067 indicated that certain haloalkyl substituted polynuclear aryl hydrocarbons of the condensed benzene ring type are active photopolymerization catalysts. More recently, U. S. Patent No. 2,243,793 to R. P. Williams briefly indicated that unspecified polychlorobenzenes and polychloroxylenes might act as photosensitizers without any definitive elucidation of their particular structure. U. S. Patent No.4,239,609 teaches use of certain dichloromethyl groups containing aromatic compounds as activators for aromatic carbonyl photoinitiators, rather than as photoinitiators themselves. Summary of the Present Invention It has now been found that certain alpha halogenated aromatic compounds are effective as photoinitiators in monomeric and polymeric compositions of photopolymerizable substances. The photoinitiators used in connection with the present invention have the following formula EMI2.1 where X is halogen, e.g., preferably chlorine or bromine,R is either X or hydrogen, Rt is hydrogen or C1 Ce alkyl, A is either X, C R , X or CH2R, and n is an integer of e to 2, with the proviso that when n is 0 one of either R or R1 is also X.Detailed Description of the Present Invention The compositions curable by actinic radiation according to the invention can contain a photopolymerizable polymer in a reactive ethylenically unsaturated monomeric medium, a reactive polymer alone, a reactive monomer alone, or any of these combined with an inert solvent. Additionally, the polymerizable composition can contain any of the pigments commonly used in photopolymerization techniques. The process can be carried out by mixing a quantity of photoinitiating compound of the present invention with a photopolymerizable composition and exposing the resultant mixture to actinic radiation.Alternatively, a one component system comprising the photopolymerizable composition, the photoinitiator of the invention and, if desired, pigmentation, can be formed. The photoinitiating compounds of the invention are suitable in the actinic light curing of unsaturated monomeric compounds either alone or as copolymerizable constituents of unsaturated polymer monomer systems.Such systems are composed of mixtures of conventional unsaturated polymers and unsaturated monomers. Monomers which are useful in practicing the invention are acrylic, oC alkacrylic and bc chloro acrylic acid compounds such as esters, amides and nitriles. Examples of such compounds are acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methacrylamide and metal cC chloroacrylate. Also useful, although not preferred due to their slower rates of reactivity, are vinyl and vinylidene esters, ethers and ketones. Additionally, compounds having more than one terminal unsaturation can be used.Examples of these include diallyl phthalate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl phosphate, ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate, glycerol trimethylacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, methacrylic anhydride, and allyl ethers of monohydroxy or polyhydroxy compounds, such as ethylene glycol diallyl ether, pentaerythritol, tetraallyl ether, and the like. Nonterminally unsaturated compounds such as diethyl fumarate can similarly be used. The acrylic acid derivatives are particularly well suited to the practice of the invention and are consequently preferred components as monomers in monomer containing polymerizable systems and as reactive centers in polymerizable polymers. A preferred manner of practicing the invention is by the use of photopolymerizable molding and coating compositions which comprise mixtures of unsaturated polymeric compounds and monomeric compounds copolymerizable therewith. The polymeric compounds can be conventional polyesters prepared from unsaturated polycarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, glutaconic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid and the like, and polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, 1,2 butanediol, 1,4 butanediol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane and the like.The carboxylic acid content can also contain saturated components. The inclusion of a monobasic fatty acid content, either as such or in the form of a triglyceride or oil, in the photopolymerizable polyester composition to comprise an alkyd resin is also acceptable. These resins can, in turn, be modified by silicones, epoxides, isocyanates, etc., by known techniques. The alpha halogenated aromatic photoinitiators of the present invention, which are rather economical compounds to produce, can be combined with at least one or more expensive known glyoxylate,benzoin ether or acetophenone type photoinitiator, for example, to yield photoinitiator combinations of enhanced activity at reasonable cost. Glyoxylate photoinitiators are known compounds and possess the glyoxylate group C 0 C O O attached to suitable moieties which confer photoinitiator utility on the resulting compound. Compounds of this type are described in U. S. Patent 4,038,164 to F. A.Via, which is incorporated herein by reference. That patent describes compounds of the formulaEMI5.1 where R can be a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon e.g., C1 C10 alkyl of from one to ten carbon atoms, aryl, aralkyl, or mono di, or trisilyl and Rt is a heterocyclic radical, aryl of from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, or mono , di or polysubstituted phenyl with such substituents as alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylthio, arylthio and halogen. Preferably, R is alkyl and i is phenyl. A commercial product of this type is sold under the trademark VICURE 55 by Stauffer ChemicalCompany and contains methyl phenyl glyoxylate as the photoinitiator. The terminology benzoin ether as used herein is intended to cover those compounds that have photoinitiator action which contain at least one OR group on the alpha carbon atom adjacent the carbonyl group bridging the two phenyl rings contained in the compound.Such compounds are of the formulaEMI6.1 where R is alkyl, is either hydrogen, alkyl, halogen or alkoxy, and where R is independently alkyl, alkoxy, halogen and alkylamino. More than one R group can be present on either of the phenyl rings to substitute for the hydrogen atom normally present. When is alkoxy, these compounds are commonly known as the ketals of benzil. Commercial photoinitiators of this type are sold under the trademarks VICURE 10 iiobutyl andR hydrogen and VICURE 30 R isopropyl and R r hydrogen by Stauffer Chemical Company and IRGACURE 651 R r methyl and R I methoxy by Ciba GeigyCorporation. Also includebla are acetophenone photoinitiators of the formulaEMI7.1 where R is lower alkyl e.g., Ct Cc alkyl . An example is diethoxyacetophenone. In such mixtures, the amount of alpha chlorinated aromatic compound of the instant invention is present at about 25 by weight, or greater, of the mixture of that compound and the selected benzoin ether, glyoxylate, acetophenone photoinitiator or photoinitiators. A preferred amount is a weight ratio of from about 40 60 to about 99 1 of alpha chlorinated compound to known photoinitiating compound or compounds. Additionally, the photopolymerizable composition can contain a sensitizer capable of enhancing the photoinitiating reactivity of the photoinitiating compound of the invention. Examples of sensitizers useful in the practice of the invention are such compounds as xanthone, thioxanthone, acetophenone and the like. These are typically added in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 6 weight percent.The techniques whereby such sensitizers are selected for use in conjunction with particular photoinitiators are well known in the art. See for example, Murov,Handbook of Photochemistry, Marcel Dekker, Inc.,New York 1973 . Thus it is seen that the constitution of photopolymerizable compositions which can be used in the practice of the invention is widely variable. However, the compounds enumerated above are purely illustrative.Materials subject to polymerization by actinic radiation as well as permissible variations and substitutions of equivalent components within particular types of compositions are well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds which function as photoinitiators in accordance with the present invention are known for other uses and are easily synthesized by known means. The photoinitiators of the invention can be utilized in amounts ranging from 0.01 to about 30 by weight based on the photopolymerizable composition.However, preferable amounts of the compounds are from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent with optimal results being achieved with amounts in the range of from about 1.0 to about 16 weight percent. An acceptable source of actinic light radiation is any apparatus which emits light radiation in the approximate region of from about 2000 Angstroms to about 8000 Angstroms and preferably from about 2400Angstroms to about 5400 Angstroms. One such apparatus is PPG Model QC 1202, a W processor, manufactured by PPG Industries, Inc. The present invention is illustrated by theExamples which follow. TEST PROCEDURE USED IN THE EXAMPLES The induced rate of photopolymerization of a standard test solution of acrylate alkyd resin was measured for each of the compounds tested. This standard test solution consisted of 42 , by weight, trimethylolpropane triacrylate TMPTA , 17e by weight, of ethylhexyl acrylate EHA , and 41 , by weight of an unsaturated long chain linseed oil alkyl resin ACTOMER X 80 brand from Union Carbide . The test solution was exposed to light radiation from a light source PPG Model QC 1202 which contained two high intensity, medium pressure quartz mercury lamps, 12 inches in length, with each operating at a linear power density of about 200 watts per inch or 2400 watts per lamp. The lamps were housed in an elliptical reflector above a variable speed conveyor belt so that each lamp provided a 2 inch band of high flux actinic radiation on the conveyor. This 2 inch exposure area was bordered on both sides by an additional 2 inch area of medium flux energy for a total radiation area of 6 inches for each lamp. In the curing data presented herein, the cure rate of the polymerizable compositions is presented in feet perminute per lamp ft. min. lamp . Thus, a conveyor belt speed of one foot min. will, with a 12 inch exposure area for the two lamps, provide 60 seconds of exposure or a cure rate of 0.5 ft. min. lamp.Similarly, a belt speed of 10 ft. min. will provide 6 seconds of exposure or a rate of 5.0 ft. min. lamp, while a speed of 20.0 ft. min. will give 3 seconds exposure or a rate of 10 ft. min. lamp. The extent of curing was determined by a standard pencil hardness test with all samples being coated on aluminum plate to a thickness of 2 mils and polymerized to achieve standard pencil hardness of from 4H to 6H where this was attainable.
