# A sense amplifier.

## Abstract
A flip flop type sense amplifier for a semiconductor memory device is disclosed. The sense amplifier comprises a pair of CMOS inverters cross coupled each other to form a CMOS flip flop circuit having a couple of buffer circuits Q₇, Q₈ Q₉, Q₁₀ , which receive the read out voltage signals D from multi level memory cells and a predetermined re ference voltage Ref , respectively, and a couple of switching circuits Q₅, Q₆ Q₁₁, Q₁₂ for inverting the power source volt age across the flip flop circuit through common sources of the flip flop circuit, in response to the transition between stand by sequence and latching operation. That is, the com mon source of the p channel transistors of the CMOS flip flop circuit is connected to the negative potential source V
