# Ferro magnetic recording materials.

## Abstract
Low performance ferromagnetic oxides are taught to be convertible into high performance ferromagnetic oxides with vastly improved coercivity by suspending ferromagnetic oxide particles in aqueous media, forming a layer of the first metal on the surfaces of the particles, forming a layer of second metal on the surfaces of the first metal and lastly, forming a layer of third metal on the surfaces of the second metal. The first and third metals can be the same in preferrably transition metals such as cobalt. The second metal must be different than the first and third metals such as, for example, iron.
