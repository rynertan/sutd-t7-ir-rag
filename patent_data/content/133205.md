# Cored yarn as a reinforcement structure.

## Abstract
Reinforcement structure with enhanced compressive strength is obtained by wrapping a yarn helically around a core of longitudinally aligned yarn to form a sheath that compresses the core, the yarn of both sheath and core having a tenacity greater than 10 dN tex and an initial mod ulus greater than 200 dN tex.
