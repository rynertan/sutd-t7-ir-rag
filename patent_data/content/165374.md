# Industrial robot.

## Abstract
An industrial robot having a first arm 13 pivotable about an axis A2 and a second arm 14 carried on one end of the first arm for pivot movement about an axis A3 which is parallel to the pivot axis of the first arm. The second arm is composed of an arm body 25 , which carries a rotary member 31 rotatable about an axis A4 normal to the pivot axis of the second arm. A twist body 55 secured to one axial end of the rotary member carries a bend body 65 rotatable about an oblique axis A5 which is slanted with respect to the rotational axis of the rotary member, and the bend body carries a swivel body 70 rotatable about an axis A6 which is slanted with respect to the oblique axis. The twist body is formed at a portion radially offset from the rotational axis of the rotary member with an eccentric cylindrical portion 56 , in which a first pair of shafts 58, 62 for transmitting rotational power respectively to the bend and swivel bodies are rotatably carried in approximately coaxial alignment with each other. Further, a second pair of shafts 42, 44 for respectively rotating the first pair of shafts are rotatably carried in the rotary member, with one of them being in coaxial relation with the rotational axis of the rotary member, but with the other of them being in coaxial relation with one of said first pair of shafts.
