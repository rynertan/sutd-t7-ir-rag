## Description
CUTTER ASSEMBLY This invention relates to 2 cutter assembly and to a cutting machine including such a cutter asseribly. There is an increasing requirement for pipes or ducts of various shapes to be joined together for very demanding applications, such as high vacuum or sodium containment in a radioactive environment. It is often required that the joints between such pipes or ducts be separated and subsequently rejoined, for example to enable access to be gained to the interior of the pipes or ducts. In general, such joining and separating operations must be repeated a number of times, and it has been proposed to use an automatically guided motcrized carriage for this purpose.This solution is preferred even if personnel can normally gain access to the interior of the pipes or ducts, since it gives reliable results and avoids human error. Formation of the joints between the pipes or ducts is normally achieved by welding. The welding has to meet high vacuum standards and must compensate for misalignment and gaps caused by the tolerances of the mating lips of the joint. Also, the joints are often curved in a vertical plane, so the welding must also counter the effects on the weld pool caused by the varying welding attitudes required. Separation of such welded joints is most converliently performed by cutting. However, the cutting operation must be performed without introducing deformations or metallurgical alterations which might impair subsequent re welding of the joint. In addition, the pieces of the joint whach are cut away and any other debris must be removed so as not to contaninate the interior of the pIpes cr ducts. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cutter assembly which enable the above requirements to be satisfied. It is 2 further object of the present invention to provide a cutting machine including such a cutter assembly which can be red for the purpose stated. From French Patent Specification No. 2067344 andGerman Patent Specification No. 696890, machines are known which are arranged to move along a workpiece and to perform a machining operation continuously as they move along the workpiece. Pcth machines are however designed for welding seams together and there is no disclosure in these specifications of their use as cutters. Accord n one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cutter assembly comprising a housing, a member slidable within the housing, a first cutter member secured TC the housing and disposed substantially internally thereof, a sec nd cutter member mounted on the slidable member for movement herewith and disposed internally of the housing, the second cutter member being movable towards and away from the first cutter member and co operating therewith to perform a cutting action in use, and an opening in the housing through which a workpiece can be inserted in use to be cut by the cutter members. Preferably, the housing has a cavity therein which is disposed so as to receive pieces of said workpiece which are removed by the cutter members in use, and means is provided for removing said pieces from the cavity. Desirably, the removing means includes fluid directing means which opens into the cavity and which is arranged to guide the removed pieces of said workpiece into an outlet from the cavity. Advantageously, the cavity is connectable to a vacuum source, the second cutter member wben juxtaposed to the first cutter member substantially seals the cavity, and the fluid directing means comprises at least one port which communicates with the exterior of the housing, whereby external atmosphere enters the cavity through the or each port when a vacuum is applied to the cavity in use. Conveniently, the second cutter member can be indexed so a. to present a different part of a cutting edge thereof to the first cutler member in successive cutting strokes. Most conveniently, the second cutter member has a pluralit of recesses associated therewith, the recesses being arrar ed generally on a circle centred on an axis about which tie second cutter member is indexible, and the second cutter member is indexed in use directing a jet of fluid into each recess in turn. It is preferred that the housing defines a chamber therein for the reception of pressurized fluid, an that the slidable member is in the form of a piston which is acted on in use by said pressurized fluid. In this case, the piston can be rotatable relative to the housing about the indexing axis of the second cutter member, the second cutter member being rotatable with the piston, and said recesses can be provided in a face of the piston, preferably the face which is acted on by the pressurized fluid in use so that the piston and second cutter member are indexed by pressurized fluid entering the chamber in use. The housing can be made in two parts which are connected together, said opening being formed between mutually facing portions of the two housing parts. Desirably, the slidable member is slidably mounted on a shaft disposed within the housing, and the second cutter member is annular and is disposed coaxially wflth respect to the axis of the shaft. Advantageously, limit switches are provided which are actuable when the slidable element reaches either o Iwo extreme positions. The limit switches are conveniently actuable by an element which is resiliently biassed into operative engagement with the slidable member and wn.ich serves to urge the slidable element into one of said two extreme positions. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cutting machine for successively removing pieces from a workpiece, comprising a transporter, a moving mechanism operable to move the transporter along the workpiece in use, a cutter assembly as defined In any one of the last ben preceding mounted on the transporter, and a control responsive to the completion of each cutting operation to energise the moving mechanism to move the transporter a predetermined distance along the workpiece. In this way, the cutting machine can be operated remotely without the need for manual intervention. Preferably, the control is arranged to render the moving mechanism inoperative if the cutting operation is not successfully completed. Conveniently, a detector is mounted on the transporter and is arranged to detect the position of the workpiece relative thereto, and means is provided for adjusting the position of the cutter assembly relative to the transporter in accordance with signals received from the detector. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic front view of a cutting machine according to the present invention Figure 2 is a schematic plan view of the cutting machine shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a transverse sectional view of the cutting machine shown in Figures 1 and 2 Figure 4 is an axial sectional view of a cutter assemkly according to the present invention, which forms part of the cutting machine of Figures 1 to 3 Figure 5 is a front view of a movable cutter member of the cutter assembly shown in Figure 4 Figure 6 is a front view of a stationary cutter member of the cutter assembly shown in Figure 4 Figure 7 is a section along the line A A in Figure 4 with parts of the cutter assembly removed for clarity Figure 8 io a front iew of a piston which forms part of the cutter assembly o Figure 4 Figure 9 is a section taken along the line B B in Figure 6 and Figure 10 is a diagram illustrating the mariner in which the catting machine cuts successive portions from a workpiece. Referring first to Figures 1, 2 and 3, the cutting machine shown therein comprises a transporter 10 on which a cutter assembly 11 is mounted. The cutting machine is designed to travel along a workpiece 12 and to perform a cutting operation on the edge of the workpiece. In this particular example, the workpiece is in the form of two metal sheets in face to face contact and lip welded together, and the cutting machine is designed to reLove the lip weld so that the sheets can be separated. The machine can be used on such workpieces in which the weld line is either rectilinear or curved.To this end, a detector 13 is carried by the transporter 1G and detects the position of the welded joint relative Thereto. The transporter is carried by rollers 14 and can be advance along the workpiece, which remains stationary, by means of four drive assemblies 15. The cutter assembly 11 is carried by a latform 16 which is in turn mounted on the transporter 10 lsW Leans ol a slide 17. The slide 17 enables the platform 16 and cutter assembly 11 to be moved vertically relative to the transporter 10, and a drive assembly 18 is provided for adjusting the vertical position of the cutter assembly 11 in accordance with signals received from the detect sr 13, in order to maintain the cutter assembly 11 in the correct vertical position relative to the welded joint.A transducer 19 is operatively coupled to the platform 16 so that the vertical position of the cutter assembly 11 can be monitored. The cutter assembly 11 is mounted on the platform 16 by means of two spaced, horizontal shafts 20 see Figure 3, in which only one is visible in such a mannef that a certain degree of lateral movement of the cutter assembly 11 relative to the platform 16 is permitted. This allows the cutter assembly 11 to adjust its horizontal position so that it can remain aligned with the direction of extent of the welded joint. Such adjustment is automatic and results from the fact that the workpiece bears against Bart of the cutter assembly 11 during each cutting operation, as will be described in detail later on. Refering now more particulary to Figure 4, the cutter assembly 11 comprises a housing 21 made in two parts 22 and 23. Housing part 22 defines a chamber 24 therein which receives pressurized hydraulic fluid ua in use. A stepped piston 25 is disposed within the chamber 24 and is slidable axially of the housing 21 along a shaft 26. The pressurized hydraulic fluid in chamber 24 acis on one face of the piston 25, the other face thereof being operatihely engaged by three spring loaded plungers 27 only one shown . Tie shaft 20 also acts to secure the housing parts 22 and 23 together, housing part 22 being engaged by a headed portion of the shaft 26 and housing part 23 being engaged by a screw threaded portion thereof. Housing parts 22 and 23 are additionally secured together at their adjoining peripheries by six clamping bolts not shown . A sleeve 26a is interposed between the wider end of the piston 25 and the interior surface of the housing part 22, and is fixed relative to the latter.A further sleeve 26b is secured to a spigot on housing part 23 and slidingly receives the narrower end of the piston 25. Mounted on the piston 25 so as to be movable therewith axially ci t Ahe housing 21 is an annular cutter member 28 having a circular outer cutting edge 29. The cutter member 23 is movable towards and away from a further cutter member 30 which is secured to the housing part 23. In fact cutter member 30 is recessed into a portion of housing part 23 which is presented to housing part 22. The cutter member 30 is part annular in form and has an arcuate inner cutting edge 31 which co operates with the cutting edge 29 on cutter member 28 to perform a cutting action when the piston 25 is reciprocated.The cutter members 28 and 30 are shown in detail in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The housing 21 has an opening 32 therein through which the worktlece 12 is inserted, the opening 32 being defined by a slot between mutually facing portions of the housing. parts 22 and 23. As can be seen from Figure 4, the workpiece 12 can bear against the cutted member 30, which acts as an anvil dulling the cutting operation. In order to distribute wear of the cutter member 2Q as evenly as possible along its periphery, the cutter member 28 is designed to be indexed around the shaft t 26 between successive cutting strokes. To this end, th. piston 25 is provided with twelve recesses 33 in its said one face, the recesses 33 being arranged gere.a lv on a dole centred on the axis of the pisten and being equi angularly disposed around that axis. The recesses 33 are shown to advantage in Figures 8 and 9. Each recess 33 can be aligned in turn with a passage 34 see also Figure 1 formed in an end wall of the housing part 22, through which hydraulic fluid is supplied to the chamber 24. The incoming hydraulic fluid at the beginning of each cutting stroke impinges on the particular recess 33 which is aligned with passage 34 at the time, causing the piston 25 to be indexed about the shaft 26. The cutter member 28 is rotatable with the piston 25, and therefore is indexed also. In this way, different parts of the cutting edge 29 of cutter member 28 are presented to the cutter member 30 in successive cutting strokes. A cavity 35 Is defined within the housing part 23, ana communicates with the opening 32 by means of an arcuate space 36 between the cutter member 30 and the piston 25. This space 36 is substantially closed by the cutter member 28 when the latter is juxtaposed to the cutter members 30. The cavity 35 is connected to a vacuum source not shown through the intermediary of an outlet 37 see Figure 7 , and three ports 32 only one visible open into the cavity 35 from the exterior of the housing 21. When the space 36 is substantially closed by cutter member 28, a vacuum is applied to the cavIty 35 so as to suck therefrom pieces removed from the workpiece. At the same time external atmospheric air rushes in through the ports 38 and creates air jets which guide the removed pieces towards and through the outlet 37. Part of the cavIty 37 is occupied by an arcuate block 39 which has three bores 40 therein, each bore housing a respective one of the spring loaded plungers 27. One of the plungers 27 see Figure 4 has a configurated outer surface, with which an actuator member of each of a pair of micro switches 41 and 42 can engage. Micro switch 41 is arranged to be actuated when the piston 25 moves into and out of an extreme rightward position, as viewed in Figure 4, i.e. upon the successful completion of a cutting stroke, and micro switch 42 is arranged to be actuated when the piston 25 moves into and out of an extreme leftward position, i.e. upon return of the cutter member 28. The cutting machine operates as follows. Upon the completion of a cutting operation, the transporter 10 is advanced a predetermined distance along the workpiece 12. A solenoid operated valve not shown is then opened to supply pressurized hydraulic fluid to the chamber 24 ia the passage 34, thereby moving the piston 25 to the right, as viewed in Figure 4. The cutter members 28 and 30 then perform a cutting operation on the workpiece 12 in the following manner. The movable cutter member 28 bears against the workpiece 12 and urges the workpiece and the stationary cutter 30 into mutual engagement. The cutting edges 29 and 31 then co operate to slice through the workpiece and cut away a portion of its edge. The force of the cutting action and the movement of the cutter member 28 cause the removed portion of the orkpiece to be ejected into the cavity , 35. A vacuum is then applied to the cavity 35 to o extract the removed workpiece portion therefrom in the nanner described previously. Referring nw to Figure 10, the portion of the workpiece 12 thus cut away referenced 50 and indicated by hatching is curved In shape and has two arcuate edges defined by successive cuts of the cutting edges 29 and 31. By making the distance travelled by the cutting machine between successive cuts comparatively small, the resultant cut edgt 51 of the w orkpiece 12 can be made substantially smooth. When the piston 25 reaches its extreme rightward position at the end of the cutting stroke, micro switch 41 is actuated and a predetermined delay in the cycle oi operations ensues to allow sufficient time for the removed piece of the workpiece and any other debris to be sucked away through the outlet 37.The above mentioned solenoid operated valve is then closed, and a further solenoid operatedvalve not showm is opened allowing the hydraulic fluid to drain from the chamber 24 and the piston 25 to move to the left as viewed in Figure 4 under the action of the spring loaded plungers 27. When the piston 25 reaches its extreme leftward position, micro switch 42 is actuated thereby closing the further solenoid operated valve and initiating the next Incremental advance of the transporter 10. In the event that the cutter members 28 and 30 fail to cut through the workpiece 12, or for any other reason the cutting operation is not successfully completed, a control mechanism prevents the transporter 10 from being further advanced along the woritplece 12 and displays a warn r g to an operator of the machine. The cutting machine can be operated remotely If desired, which makes it particularly suitable for use in an enclosed enviroment. Where the cutting machine is to be used in an enviroment which must remaind free from contamination, de oxygenated and de ionised water can be used as the hydraulic fluid. In this case, the cutting nachine is provided with a piston and cylinder assembly not illustrated by means of which a conventional hydraulic fluid, e.g. oil, pressurized tlie de oxygenated and de ionized water. The piston and cylinder assembly comprises a closed cylinder within which a piston is slldable, the oil being supplied to the cylinder on one side of the piston and the water being supplied to the cylinder on the other. The stroke of the piston is adjustable, so that the volume of water which is delivered to the chamber 24 during each piston stroke can be ailed. This volume is in fact adjusted so as to be enough to allow a cutting stroke tc be completed, but not enough to allow the cutter assembly piston 25 to exert a large thrust on the housing 21 at the end of its stroke. As mentioned above, the distance by which the cutting machine is advanced can be adjusted so that the edge produced by the cutting operation is smooth. Also, there are no undulations In the workpiece transversely of its direction of extent due to the cutting action. Furthermore, by suitable adjustment of the vertical position of the cutter assembly relative to the workpiece, a minimum vestage of material can be obtained. Thus, where as in the embodiment described above the workpiece is in the form of two metal sheets lit welded in face to face relation, the cutter assembly can be so positioned That the sheets are cut us belu the weld line.
