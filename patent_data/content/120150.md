# Mixed pile and knit combined fabric.

## Abstract
The invention consists of a fabric in which coupling be tween pile stripes 1 as a warp and weft threads 2 is carried out entirely on a machine, so as to obtain a combined fabric having fur stripes directly inserted during a knitting operation without requiring manual operations, which are cousing con siderable consumption of time and labour.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1 Mixed pile and knit combined fabric, characterized by the fact that fur stripes as a warp are machine knitted with a base loop and weaved to said loop with a weave filling also made on the loom. 2 Mixed pile and knit combined fabric, according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that the stripes of fur or its pretwisted derivatives are arranged in a warp on preset beams, which are then placed on a flat knitting machine which at the same time makes the basic loops and the reverse weave filling. 3 Mixed pile and knit combined fabric, according to Claim 2, characterized by the fact that the basic loops are interlaced with the pile by means of spaced chain stitches. 4 Mixed pile and knit combined fabric, according to Claim 2, characterized by the fact that the weave filling is made with light yarns, such as acrylic yarn, by vertical needles of the flat knitting machine.

## Description
MIXED PILE AND KNIT COMBINED FABRIC The present invention relates to a combined fabric in which coupling of fur stripes and weft threads is effected mechanically, using the technique of the flat knitting machines such as the well known Raschel looms. It is a long time that the textile industry is looking for an ideal or anyway most favorable solution, to create an entirely machine made fabric, in which fur is not an ancillary part, applied on the already finished fabric with further operations which are almost invariably manual, but on the contrary is an integral part forming the warp of said fabric. Up to now, stripes were indeed applied on the fabric or alternated to it, and this required at least a second working stage after the knitting stage, and this was also aggravated by the necessity of employing skilled personnel with a very good experience to obtain an acceptable final product. The present invention removes these inconveniences and solves these problems, by providing a fabric which is entirely made on a machine, in which the fur stripes are perfectly bonded so as the become an integral part of the fabric texture. The fabric according to the present invention is therefore characterized by the fact that the fur stripes are arranged in a warp which is then placed on preset loom beams, arranged on a flat knitting machine making at the same time the base loop and the reverse weave filling. These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will however become apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment, which is given as a non limiting example only and is made with reference to the annexed sheet of accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a portion of a finished combined fabric according to the present invention Fig. 2 is an elevational front view thereof and Fig. 3 is a view of the weave filling only of the fabric shown in Fig. 1. With reference now to the figures of the accompanying drawing, the fabric according to the present invention consists of stripes 1 of fur or its pretwisted derivatives, arranged in a warp on preset beams, which are then placed on a flat knitting machine, which interlaces with said warp fur stripes 1, the threads of the basic loops 2, weaving with the warp pile 1 generally by means of chain stitches 3, while the vertical needles make the reverse weave filling 4 obtained with acrylic or similar yarns, such as yarns of Acrilon 2312 Ne, representing only 4.5 of the total fabric weight. In this way one obtains a fabric in which all the components are perfectly integrated and were all machine made without requiring any manual operation. It is clear that the fabric illustrated in the accompanying drawing is only an example and it is to be understood that any kind of suitable yarn may be used for the pile, the basic loops and the weave filling, as well as the type and frequence of the binding stitches between pile and knit may be varied according to the requirements of production and use, and many other modifications, variations, additions and or substitutions of elements may be resorted to the fabric according to the present invention, without departing however from its scope and always falling in its main feature which, as already stated, consist in making said fabric in an entirely mechanical way, as it is also defined in the appended claims.
