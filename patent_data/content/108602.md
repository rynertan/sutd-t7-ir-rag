US A 4145435 discloses some cis and trans N 2 aminocycloaliphatic 2 arylacetamide derivative compounds, e.g. N 2 N ,N dimethylamino cyclohexyl N methyl 2 t4 bromophenyl acetamide and trans N methyl N 2 Ci pyrrolidinyl cyclohexyl 2 3, 4 dichiorophenyl acetamide, which have potent analgesic activity the preferred compounds thereof have, in addition, only low to moderate apparent physical dependence liability compared to morphine and methadone. US A 4098904 discloses some cis and trans N 2 aminocycloaliphatic benzamide compounds, e.g.N methyl N 2 1 pyrrolidinyl cyclohexyl 3,4 dichlorobenzamide, which have potent analgesic activity. They are therefore useful for relieving pain in warm blooded animals. US A 4212878 discloses some N l amino 4 mono or di oxygen group substituted cyclohexyl methyl3 benzene acetamide derivatives, e.g. 2 3,4 dichlorophenyl N 9 1 pyrrolidinyl 1,4 dioxaspiro 4.5 dec 8 yl methyl acetamide, which also have analgesic drug properties, with lower physical dependence liability characteristics than morphine or methadone. US A 4065573 discloses some 4 amino 4 phenylcyclohexanone ketal compounds, e.g. 4 m hydroxyphenyl 4 dimethylamino cyclohexanone ethylene ketal and 4 m hydroxyphenyl1 4 n butylmethylamino cyclohexanone ethylene ketal, which are useful for relieving pain in animals. Some of these compounds exhibit narcotic antagonist activity.This specification also discloses compounds of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein, in the cycloaliphatic ring, n is 1, 2 or 3, p is 1,2 or 3 and 2 n p 4 indicates that the NR1R2 substituent is in either cis or trans configuration with respect to each other substituent on the cycloaliphatic ring q is O or 1 E is O or S X and Y are independently selected from H, F, C1,Br, CF3, NO2, OCH3, OH, N3, C13 alkyl, phenyl, SO2CH3,CN, NH2, C13 alkoxy carbonyl, C1 3 alkanoyloxy and 1 3 carboxacylamino R is H or C13 alkyl either R1 and R2 are independently selected fromH, C1 3 alkyl and allyl or NR1R2 is azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl or piperidinyl and either R3 is OH, C1 3 alkoxy or C 1 3 alkanoyloxy and R4 is hydrogen or R3and R4 are taken together and are OCH2CH2O, SCH2CH2S, O, S, NOH or NOOCCH3 and the acid addition, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable, salts thereof. Compounds of the present invention are those of formula I but in which either R3 is H and R4 is SH or C1 3 alkyl thio or R3 and R4 are independently selected from OCH3, OC2H5, SCH3 and SC2H5, and acid addition salts thereof. Compounds of the invention can be formulated, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, for use in alleviating pain in warm blooded animals.The pain may be, for example, traumatic, bone, cancer, post surgical, homotopic, menstrual or headache pain. In compounds of the invention, the carbon atom bearing the R and R4 groups is separated from the 3 carbon atoms of the cycloaliphatic ring bearing nitrogen atoms, by at least one other carbon atom. Compounds of the invention may be prepared or used in a form of acid addition salts thereof, and preferably pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts thereof. Thus, the Rs, R4 substituent moiety is in the 4 position of cyclopentyl ring compounds, in the 4 or S posi tion of cyclohexyl ring compounds or a mixture of compounds wherein the R3 and R4 substituents are on the 4 and 5 positions , and in the 4 , 5 or 6 positions of cycloheptyl ring compounds or a mixture of such R3, R4 position isomers . Thus, this invention involves compounds wherein the R3, R4 bearing carbon is not vicinal adjacent to either of the nitrogen bearing carbons of that same cycloaliphatic ring. The compounds of Formula II or their acid addition salts in their crystalline state may sometimes be isolated from their reaction mixtures as solvates, i.e., with a discrete quantity of solvent, e.g., water, ethyl acetate, methanol and the like, associated physically, and thus not affecting the chemical entity per se. It will be recognized by those skilled in the organic chemical art that the carbon atoms at positions 1 and 2 of the cycloaliphatic ring of structure I1 to which nitrogens are bonded are asymmetrically substituted. Likewise, for certain definitions of R3 and R4, the cycloaliphatic ring carbon atom to which R3 and R4 are bonded may also be asymmetrically substituted. Each of these three carbon atoms can independently possess an R or S configuration and thus a compound of the formula II may have as many as 2 or 8 stereoisomers which comprise four pairs of enantiomers each enantiomeric pair is termed a racemate. See, for example, J.B. Hendrickson, D.J. Cram, and G. S.Hammond, Organic Chemistry, Third Edition, McGraw Hill Book Company,New York, NY, 1970, pages 198 230,. particularly pages 207, 208, 213, and 215. Of the four racemates, two will have the nitrogen containing groups at positions 1 and 2 of structure II in a trans orientation that is, the groups will be on opposite sides of the plane of the cycloaliphatic ring such compounds will be generally referred to in this specification as trans compounds.The other two racemates will have the nitrogen containing groups at positions 1 and 2 of structure II in a cis orientation that is, the groups will be on the same side of the cycloaliphatic ring such compounds will be generally referred to in this specification as cis compounds and are meant to include both possible configurations of the third substituted ring carbon atom if it is asymmetrically substituted. The four racemates of structure 11 compounds can each exist as a mixture of the two enantiomers or each enantiomer of each pair can be separated.When it is desired to specify for a structure II compound the configuration of the other asymmetric center relative to that of position 1, this is done according to the Chemical Abstracts Service Publication, Naming and Indexing of Chemical Substances for CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS during theNinth Collective Period 1972 1976 , a reprint of Section IV Selection of Index Names for Chemical Substances from the CHEMICALABSTRACTS Volume 76 Index Guide.Accordingly, the relative stereochemistry of three asymmetric carbon atoms in the cycloaliphatic ring of Formula II compounds is indicated by 1 the arbitrary designation of la for the orientation of the substituent on asymmetric carbon atom number one 2 the designation 2a or 2ss when the substituent on asymmetric carbon atom number two is on the same or opposite side of the plane of the cycloaliphatic ring, respectively, relative to saidC1 substituent, and 3 the designation xa or xS when the substituent on asymmetric carbon atom number x is on the same or opposite side of the plane of the cycloaliphatic ring, respectively, relative to said C1 substituent. Two isomers which differ only in the stereochemistry at one asymmetric carbon atom of the cycloaliphatic ring are referred to as epimers. In the above Formula II compounds, the halogens having atomic numbers of from 9 to 35 are fluorine, chlorine and bromine, the term C1 to C3 alkyl 8 means methyl, ethyl, n propyl and isopropyl, the term C1 to C2 alkyl means methyl and ethyl, and allyl means 2 propen l yl. A preferred subgroup of these Formula II compounds are those wherein p is 1 to 3, n is 1 to 3 and p and n are selected so that the cycloaliphatic ring has 5 to 7 ring carbons, q is O or 1, and at least one of X and Y is a halogen having an atomic number of from 9 to 35 in the 3 or 4 positions, or both of X and Y are such halogens in the 3and 4 positions of the phenyl ring R is C1 to C alkyl R1 and RZ are taken together with the nitrogen to which they are bonded to complete an azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl or piperidinyl ring Rj and R, are each a GRs group, R5 is C1 to C2 alkyl and G is oxygen, and E is oxygen, and the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof.Examples of compounds of this group include the cis and trans isomers of 3,4 dichloro N 4,4 dimethoxy 2 1 pyrrolidinyl cyclohexyl N methylbenzeneacetamide which can also be named 3,4 dichloro N methyl N 4 oxo Z 1 pyrrolidinyl cycloheXyl ben zeneacetamide, dimethyl ketal, 3,4 dichloro N E5,5 diethoxy 2 1 pyrrolidinyl cycloheXyl N methyl benzeneacetami de, 4 bromo N 4,4 dimethoxy 2 1 pyrrolidinyl cyclohexyl N methylbenzamide, 3,4 dichloro N 4,4 dimethoxy 2 1 azetidinyl cyclopentyl Nethylbenzeneacetamide, 3,4 difluoro N ED,4 dimethoxy 2 1 piperidinyl cycloheptyl N methylbenzeneacetamide, 4 bromo N 6,6 diethoxy 2 1 pyrrolidinyl cycloheptyl benzamide, and the like, and the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof. The di C1 to C2 alkyl ketals of this invention, that is, the compounds of the Formula II wherein R3 is GR5 and R4 is GRs and each G is oxygen, can be prepared by reacting a ketone of Formula XVII Chart A below or the analogous cis amino amide ketone Charts B, C, and D below in methanol or ethanol as solvent in the presence of trimethylorthoformate or triethylorthoformate, respectively, and a suitable acid such as hydrochloric acid. The resulting reaction mixture is reacted at from 200 C. to reflux for a time sufficient to form the desired dialkyl ketal compound II usually a reaction time of about 16 hours in refluxing methanol or ethanol is a sufficient reaction time.The solvent is then removed by evaporation and. the dialkyl ketal product 11 is purified by conventional techniques such as recrystallization or chromatography. Alternatively the di C1 to C2 alkyl ketals of this invention can be prepared by reacting a ketone of the formula XVII or the analogous cis amino amide ketone with either methanol or ethanol in the presence of an acidic catalyst such as para toluenesulfonic acid at a temperature up to the reflux temperature of the mixture for about 14 to 24 hours, optionally using a solvent such as benzene and azeotropically removing the water formed, to form the desired dialkyl ketal of this invention. Such a method is well known in the art see, for example,S. M. Mcrivan and M. J. Curry in Journal of the American ChemicalSociety, Volume 70, pages 3781 and following, 1948. The di C1 C2 alkylthio ketals of this invention, that is, the compounds of the Formula II wherein R3 Is GR5, R4 is GRs and eachG is sulfur can be prepared by methods well known in the art as described generally in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , T. W.Greene, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1981, pp. 129 30. Thus a ketone of the Formula XVII or an analogous cis ketone, is reacted with methyl or ethyl mercaptan in the presence of a suitable acid such as hydrochloric acid to form a dialkylthio ketal of this invention. The thiols of this invention, that is, compounds of the Formula II wherein R3 is hydrogen and R4 is SH, are prepared by methods known in the art as described for example in Comprehensive OrganicChemistry The Synthesis and Reactions of Organic Compounds , Ed. D.Barton and W. D. Ollis, Volume 3 edited by D. N. Jones, PergamonPress, New York, 1979, pp. 6 8. For example, an alcohol of theFormula XVIII Chart A or an analogous cis alcohol can be converted to a para toluenesulfonate derivative which is reacted with hydrogen sulfide to produce the desired thiol of this invention. An additional helpful literature reference is The Chemistry of the ThiolGroup Part 1, Ed. S. Patai, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1974, for example, pages 163, 164, 179, 180, 220. The monoalkylthio compounds of this invention, that is, the compounds of Formula 11 wherein R3 is hydrogen and R4 is S C1 toC3 alkyl , are prepared by methods known in the art as described, for example, in Comprehensive Organic Chemistry cited above, pages 36 39. A thiol of this invention produced as described above is reacted with an appropriate C1 to C3 alkyl halide, preferably bromide, to produce a monoalkylthio compound of this invention. Throughout the synthetic procedures described herein, care must be taken that the groups X and Y are not undesirably altered by the reaction conditions. The use of protecting groups may be necessary as well known in the art. The starting materials to prepare the new compounds of this invention Formula II compounds above are described in applicationSerial Number 06 252,535 filed April 9, 1981, now US Patent 4,360,531.In general, and with the exceptions set forth below, these starting materials can be prepared by reacting the selected 1,2 cycloaliphatic diamine of the Formula IIIEMI10.1 wherein p, n, R, RI, R2, are as defined above and Rg and R4, taken together, denote an 0CH2CH20 ethylene ketal substituent with 1 a suitable acyl source such as the appropriate acyl imidazole of the formulaEMI10.2 wherein q, E, X and Y are as defined above 2 or with an acyl halide of the formulaEMI11.1 wherein M is chloride or bromide and q, E, X and Y are as defined above in the presence of an acid scavenger such as triethylamine or 3 with the carboxylic acid of the formulaEMI11.2 in the presence of a condensing agent, such as a carbodiimide, wherein q, E, X and Y are as defined above, in an organic solvent for the reactants, preferably in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether, or a cyclic ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran THF or dioxane, or the like, until the desired amino amide ketal compound is produced.. Car bodi imi des such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or dii sopropyl carbodi imi de can be used. The amino amide ketal compound is then hydrolyzed to the amino amide ketone compound which is a starting material to make compounds of this invention of the formula II. The reactants III and IV or III and V or III and VI can be mixed in substantially equimolar proportions to effect formation of the desired starting ketone, but in cases where the nonpertinent amino nitrogens are protected against reaction, if one of the reactants III, IV, V and VI is more expensive than the other, it is sometimes preferred to use a stoichiometric excess of the less expensive reactant to insure that substantially all of the more expensive reactant is consumed in the reactions.The reaction will proceed at ambient temperature for most combinations of reactants, but for some combinations of reactants, variations from the initial to final reaction conditions may very between 25 C. and reflux temperature of the mixture depending on the activity of the reactants, the desired reaction time, the solvent being used, the molar proportions, and similar factors of concern to the chemist operating the process. Exceptions When the new compound of this invention is to be one of formula II in which one or both of R1 and R2 is to be hydrogen, the amino hydrogens in the R1 and or R2 positions must first be protected by procedures known in the art, then the N protected diamine reactant IIIa EMI12.1 wherein R,R3, R4, n and p are as defined for Formula III and each H Q denotes a protected amino hydrogen group, reacted with the selected acyl imidazole IV, or with the acyl halide V, or with the carboxylic acid VI in the presence of a condensing agent, to form the N E2 N protected ami no oxy or thia group substituted cycl oal i phaticabenzamide or benzeneacetamide, which is then treated to remove the N protecting group to leave as product the desired N E2 amino oxo or thio group substituted cyc70aliphaticlbenzami or or benzeneacetamide. Under certain conditions, N deprotection can optionally be done at a later step in the synthesis of a compound of the formula II. Procedures for preparing the aracyl imidazoles IV and acyl halide V reactants used to form compounds of this invention are known in the art. See, for example, R. B. Wagner and H. D. Zook,SYNTHETIC ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 1953, John Wiley and Sons, Chapter 17, p.546 et seq. The aracyl imidazole can be prepared in situ by reacting carbonyldiimidazole with the acid of the Formula VI in an organic solvent. The carboxylic acids VI are either known in the art or are prepared by methods known in the art. Acid addition salts can be prepared by reacting a Formula II free base with à stoichiometric amount of an acid, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid, salicyclic acid, pamoic acid, cyclohexanesulfamic acid, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, maleic, fumaric, oxalic acids and the like. The reaction can be carried out In aqueous or organic liquid solvent or non aqueous media such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and the like. Non aqueous media are preferred. When it Is desired to obtain optically resolved products in crystalline form, it may be more convenient to form salts such as maleates, citrates or pamoates rather than the inorganic acid addition salts, such as the hydrochlorides.Also, whereas some acids, for example oxalic acid, can be used to produce the amino amide product in a more easily handled solid form, e.g., in plant manufacturing isolation procedures, it would preferably not be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the amino amide product. Procedures for preparing the oxy group substituted diamines III useful for preparing the compounds of this invention can be summarized by the chemical reaction Charts A, C and D. The processes used to make the starting compounds of this invention are illustrated in Charts A, C, and D. In these Charts R,R1, R2, R5, p, n, q, E, X, and Y are as defined above B is as defined in Chart A. The products of these reactions can be isolated and purified by conventional means. Introduction of the amino protecting groups is preferably accomplished by using suitable protected amino starting materials.The choice of protecting groups should be made such that the groupsX and Y are not undesirably altered by the conditions for introduction or removal of these protecting groups. The volatility of one or more reactants may require the use of a closed reaction vessel for some of the reactions described below. Starting materials of the formulas XVI and XVII , for making compounds of this invention are prepared using the process steps illustrated in Chart A. A suitable keto alcohol of the formula VIIa is reacted with an appropriate glycol and a catalytic amount of an acid such as p toluenesulfonic acid with azeotropic removal of water to afford a hydroxy ketal of the formula VII . Alternatively, reduction of a suitable compound of the formula VIII with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride in a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran gives a hydroxy ketal of the formula VII .Reaction of a hydroxy ketal compound of the formula VII with p toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine yields a sulfonate ester of the formula IX , which sulfonate ester is reacted with a suitable base such as 1,5 diazabicycloE4.3.O non 5 ene DBN to produce an alkene of the formula X . An alkene compound of the formula X is oxidized with an organic peracid such as metachloroperbenzoic acid in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride to generate an epoxide of the formula XI . An epoxide of the formula XI is reacted with an amine of the formula, R NH R7, which amine can be used in excess and thus also serve as the reaction medium, optionally in the presence of water, at elevated temperature for a sufficient time to form an amino alcohol of the formula XII .In some instances the opening of the epoxide to produce a compound of the formula XII proceeds such that one of the possible isomeric trans products of the formula XII is the predominate or exclusive product of the reaction. Reaction of an amino alcohol of the formula XlI with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of a suitable acid scavengPr such as triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as methylene chloride, preferably with external cooling, followed by reaction of the resulting compound with an amine of the formula,HNR 1R 2, which may be taken in excess and thus serve as the reaction medium, optionally in the presence of water, at elevated temperature for a sufficient time provides a mixture of two diamines of the formula XIII , each having interchanged values of p and n relative to the other. It is recognized that when p is equal to n, only one compound of the formula XIII is obtained. Alternatively, when one of R1 and R7 is hydrogen, reaction of an amino alcohol of the formula XII with methanesulfonyl chloride, as described above, and then reaction of the resulting compound with aqueous sodium hydroxide at elevated temperature, affords an aziridine of the formula XIV which aziridine is reacted with an amine of the formula HNR 1R 2, as described above, to give a mixture of two diamines of the formula XIII , each having interchanged values of p and n relative to the other. Reaction of an epoxide of the Formula XI with an amine of theFormula HNR 1R 2, as described above, gives an amino alcohol of theFormula XV . In some instances the opening of the epoxide to produce an amino alcohol compound of the formula XV proceeds such that one of the possible isomeric trans products of the formula XV is the predominate or exclusive product of the reaction. An amino alcohol of the formula XY is reacted with methane sulfonyl chloride, as described above, followed by reaction of the resulting product with an amine of the Formula R NH2, which may be taken in excess and thus serve as the reaction medium, optionally in the presence of water, at elevated temperature for a time sufficient to form a mixture of two diamines of the Formula XIII , each having interchanged values of p and n relative to the other. A diamine of the Formula XIII is reacted with a suitable acyl source as described above to produce an amino amide of the Formula XVI . An amino amide of the Formula XVI is reacted with an aqueous mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid to give a ketone of the Formula XVII . Reduction of a ketone of the Formula XVII with K Selectride potassium tri sec butyl borohydride in a suitable organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, preferably at low temperature, 75 to 0 C. provides one hydroxy compound or two hydroxy compounds of theFormula XVII I wherein one particular epimer at the hydroxyl bearing cycloalkyl ring carbon atom usually is the more abundant or exclusive alcohol product.Alternatively, reduction of a ketone of the Formula XVII with sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol at about 0 to 25 C., gives one compound or two compounds of theFormula XVIII , wherein the more abundant or exclusive alcohol product usually is the epimer opposite in configuration to that obtained from the K Selectride reduction described above. A ketone of the Formula XVI I is converted to a dialkyl ketal compound of this invention of the Formula IIa as described above. In Charts A, C, and D, R is R or a suitable nitrogen protecting group R 1 is R1 or a suitable nitrogen protecting group R 2 is R2 or a suitable nitrogen protecting group R7 is hydrogen or a suitable nitrogen protecting group. Examples of suitable nitrogen protecting groups are 1 benzyl C6Hs CH2 i 2 triphenylmethyl trityl, C6 Hs 3C 3 para toluenesulfonyl p CH C6H4 S02 and 4 trialkylsilyl, for example, trimethylsilyl CH3 aSi or tertiary butyldimethylsilyl CH3 3CSi CH 2 5 tert butyloxycarbonyl and the like. Introduction and removal of such nitrogen protecting groups are well known in the art of organic chemistry see, for example, 1 J.F.W.McOmie, Advances in Organic Chemistry, Vol. 3, pages 191 281 1963 2 R. A. Boissonas, Advances in Organic Chemistry, Vol. 3, pgs. 159 190 1963 3 Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry ,J.F.W. McOmie, ed., Plenum Press, New York, 1973, pg. 74. The requisite hydroxycycloalkanones of Formula gila in Chart A are known in the art and are thus suitable starting materials for the processes outlined in Chart A. In addition, some of the keto ketals of the Formula VIII and some of the hydroxy ketals of the Formula VIZ are known in the art those which are not known are prepared from compounds of the formula VI by well known methods. The amines of the Formulas R NHR7 and HNR 1R 2 are either known in the art or prepared by standard methods. Under certain circumstances it is necessary to protect two different nitrogens with different protecting groups such that one such protecting group can be selectively removed while leaving the second protective group in place. The trityl and benzyl protecting groups can be used in this way, the trityl group being removable in the presence of the benzyl group under acidic conditions. Likewise, the tert butyloxycarbonyl and benzyl groups can be used in this way. The requirements for protective groups in Charts A, C, and D are generally well recognized by one skilled in the art of organic chemical synthesis, and the use, when required, of the appropriate protecting group or groups is indicated in Charts A, C, and D by the use of the symbols R , Rill, Rszs and R7 removal of a protecting group is implied when R , R 1, R 2 or R7 is replaced in a subsequent formula by R, R1, R2, or H, respectively, N protected compounds can be deprotected as desired by known methods at appropriate points in the synthesis. Cis dialkyloxy compounds of Formula II can be prepared as shown in Chart 3. The cis amino amide ketone starting material is prepared as described in Charts C or D. The cyclic ketal compound XXXVII inChart C is converted to the ketone XXV by the procedures described above. A compound of Formula II, wherein at least one of X and Y is hydroxyl, is prepared as follows A suitable ketone of Formula XVII , wherein X and or Y is methoxy, is reacted with boron tribromide in methylene chloride to produce a ketone of the Formula XVII wherein the corresponding X and or Y is hydroxyl, which hydroxyl compound can be further reacted as in Chart A. According to Chart C, reaction of a ketone of the Formula VII I with a suitable base such as sodium hydride In a suitable inert organic solvent such as DMF, followed by addition to the mixture of a lower alkyl chloroformate affords a keto ester of the Formula XXXI , which is reacted with an amine of the formula, HNR 1R 2, with azeotropic removal of water to produce an enamine of the Formula XXXI I . Alternatively, a ketone of the Formula VIII is converted to an enamine of the Formula XXXIII , which enamine is reacted with a lower alkyl chloroformate to give an enamine of the formula XXXII . Hydrogenation of an enamine of the Formula XXXII with hydrogen and a suitable catalyst such as platinum from platinum oxide in a suitable organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or a lower alkanol yields a cis amino ester of the Formula XXXIV . Reaction of an amino ester of the formula XXXIV with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example, sodium or potassium hydroxide, followed by a Curtius reaction affords a diamine of the formula XXXV . The Curtius reaction is conducted as described by P. W. Erhardt, J. Org. Chem., 44, 883 1979 , or as described by T. Shioiri, et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 94, 6203 1972 or the like.If R of a Formula II compound being prepared is C1 to C3 alkyl, then a diamine compound of the formula XXXV is alkylated with a lower alkyl halide of the formula R Z wherein Z is C1, Br or I or acylated with an appropriate acid chloride, acid anhydride or mixed anhydride in a suitable medium such as pyridine optionally at elevated temperature, followed by diborane reduction according to H. C. Brown and P. Heim, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 3565 1964 , to generate a diamine of the Formula XXXVI . Reaction of a diamine of the Formula XXXVI with a suitable acyl source as described above yields a compound of the Formula XXXVII which can be converted to a ketone of the Formula XXV as described above. When one or both of R1 and R2 of a cis Formula II compound being prepared using Chart C are to be allyl, suitable N protecting groups are used and the allyl group or groups must be introduced after the enamine hydrogenation step. To prepare additional cis Formula II compounds of this invention, a compound of the Formula XXXVI I is analogously reacted 1 as described in Chart A for the conversion of a compound of the Formula XVI to compounds of the Formulas XVII , XVIII , and aha and 2 as described elsewhere in this specification for a compound of the Formula XVI I . In addition, some of these cis compound starting materials of the Formula XXV are also prepared using an alternate process to produce a diamine of the Formula XXXVI as illustrated In Chart D. As described for Chart A, an epoxide of the Formula XI is prepared and converted to an amino alcohol of the Formula XII , which is oxidized using standard methods, for example, chromium trioxide CrO3 sulfuric acid in acetone solvent at 0 C. known as the zones oxidation or chromium trioxide pyridine, to afford a ketone of the Formula XXXVIII . A ketone of the Formula XXXVIII is reacted with an amine of the formula H2NR 1 in the presence of magnesium sulfate MgSO4 in a suitable organic solvent such as benzene to produce an imine of theFormula XXXIX . An imine of the Formula XXXIX is reduced with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride LiAlH4 or sodium cyanoorohydride NaBH3CN to give a cis diamine of the Formula XL admixed with the corresponding trans diamine. The reduction of imines with these reagents is described by D. A. Evans et al.,. J.Amer. Chem. Soc., 100, 8170 1978 . The cis diamine of structure XL is separated from the trans isomer at this stage of the synthesis or a separation is performed at a later stage, for example, after the formation of a cis benzeneacetamide or benzamide compound of theFormula XXXVI I admixed with the corresponding trans isomer of theFormula XVI . When R2 of a Formula Il compound being prepared is other than hydrogen, or when R1 and R2 of a Formula II compound being prepared, taken together with the nitrogen to which they are bonded complete an azetidinyl, pyrrotidinyl or piperidinyl ring, such nitrogen substitution is introduced at this stage of the synthesis using an alkylation of a diamine of the Formula XL , amine alkylations being well known in the art, to produce an alkylated diamine compound of the Formula XLI . An alkylated diamine of the Formula XLI is deprotected to give a diamine of the formula XXXVI which is treated with a suitable acyl source as described above to afford a compound of the Formula XXXVII .A ketal of the Formula XXXVI I is hydrolyzed to a ketone of the Formula XXV as described above. As an alternative to procedures described above, the group B inCharts A, B and D can be a dialkyl ketal rather than an ethylene ketal. The required dialkyl ketal starting materials are prepared by methods known in the art. Using this modification in Chart A, compounds of the formula XVI are compounds of this invention, wherein B represents a carbon atom bearing two C1 and C2 alkoxy groups. The dialkyl ketal compounds thus produced can be used for its analgesic effects as described in this specification, or it can be used as a chemical intermediate which, when hydrolyzed as described above, yields a ketone of the formula XVI I. The term dosage unit form as used in this specification and in the claims refers to physically discrete units suitable as uitary dosages for mammalian subjects, each unit containing as the essential active ingredient a predetermined quantity of a compound of this invention with the required pharmaceutical means which adapt said ingredient for systemic administration. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of this invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the physical characteristics of the essential active ingredient and the particular effect to be achieved in view of the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an essential active material for beneficial effects in humans and animals as disclosed in this specification, these being features of the present invention.Examples of suitable dosage unit forms in accordance with this invention are tablets, capsules, orally administered 1 liquid preparations in suitable liquid vehicles, sterile e preparations in suitable liquid vehicles for intramuscular and intravenous administration, suppositories, and sterile dry preparations for the exteim poraneous preparation of sterile injectable preparations in a suitable liquid vehicle. Suitable solid diluents or carriers for the solid oral pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are selected from the group consisting of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and mineral solids, for example, starch, sucrose, lactose, kaolin, dicalcium phosphate, gelatin, acacia, corn syrup, corn starch, talc, and the like.Capsules, both hard and soft, are filled with compositions of these amino amide active ingredients in combination with suitable diluents and excipients, for example, edible oils, talc, calcium carbonate and the like, and also calcium stearate. Liquid preparations for oral administration are prepared in water or aqueous vehicles which advantageously contain suspending agents, for example, methylcellulose, acacia, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and the like.In the case of injectable forms, the injectable formulation must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. Such preparations must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage, and ordinarily contain In addition to the basic solvent or suspending liquid, preservatives in the nature of bacteriostatic and fungistatic agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, benzyl alcohol, phenol, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it is preferably to include osmotically active agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride in isotonic concentrations. Carriers and vehicles include vegetable oils, ethanol, polyols, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like.Any solid preparations for subsequent extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable preparations are sterilized, preferably by exposure to a sterilizing gas, for example, ethylene oxide. The aforesaid carriers, vehicles, diluents, excipients, preservatives, isotonic agents and the like constitute the pharmaceutical means which adapt the preparations for systemic administration. The pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared in accordance with the preceding general description to provide from about 0.5 to about 350 mg of the essential active ingredient per dosage unit form, which as aforesaid may be in the form of a semi solid or solid, oral or rectal preparation, a liquid oral preparation, an injectable preparation including liquid preparations and solid dry preparations for extemporaneous reconstitution to a liquid injectable preparation.The amount of the essential active ingredient provided in the pharmaceutical dosage unit forms is that amount sufficient to obtain analgesic effects within the aforesaid effective non toxic range. Expressed otherwise, when used systemically, an amount of the essential active ingredient is provided to a recipient within a range from about 0.01 mg per kg to about 5 mg of the Formula II compound per kg of body weight of the recipient. Preferred dosages for most applications are 0.05 to 2.0 mg per kg of body weight. The useful pharmaceutical dosage unit forms of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations are preferably adapted for systemic administration to obtain analgesic effects comprising an effective, nontoxic amount of a compound according to Formula II or as its pharmacologically acceptable salt. Further, the invention relates to methods of obtaining analgesic effects in mammals, for example, humans and valuable warm blooded animals such as dogs, cats, horses and other commercially valuable animals, by administering systemically to the mammals the aforesaid pharmaceutical dosage unit forms supplying an effective, non tox k amount for analgesic effects. These preferred compounds have an advantage, to a greater extent, depending upon the particular compound, of having lower physical dependence liability than known analgesic compounds such as morphine and methadone, as shown by evaluation of representative compounds and those standard analgesic drug compounds in various pharmacological test procedures which measure analgesia and the physical dependence liability of the test compounds in standard laboratory test animals. Representative examples of these Formula II compounds have EDsU values of less than about 75 mg kg s.c. subcutaneous administration in standard laboratory animal analgesic tests such as the tail flick, pinch, and hydrochloric acid writhing tests, and the more potent of them have EDsu values of less than 10 mg kg s.c. in these tests.The procedures used to determine these properties of these new compounds were essentially those of Way et al., Way, E.L. et al., Simultaneous Quantitative Assessment of Morphine Tolerance andPhysical Dependence , J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 167, pp. 1 8 1969 and Saalens et al., Saalens, J. K. et al., The Mouse Jumping Test A Simple Screening Method to Estimate the Physical Dependence Capacity of Analgesics , Arch.
