# Cloning the halo organic biodegradable gene.

## Abstract
This invention relates to methods for cloning microor ganisms, that are able to matabolize a broad spectrum of halogenated organic compounds to make new life forms which have specificity for metabolizing specific halogenated organic compounds in more efficient and effective manner than the progenitors. This invention also relates to the new life forms thereby produced and the application of said new life forms in processes for degrading industrial waste containing the specific halo organic compounds desired to be disposed of.
