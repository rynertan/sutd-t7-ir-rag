# Piezoelectric crystal spark plug.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric crystal spark plug includes a body 112 similar to a conventional spark plug, a central electrode 144 extending from the bottom end of the body 112 , and a ground electrode 116 disposed near but spaced from one end of the central electrode 144 and connected to the body 112 . A piezoelectric crystal 100 is included within the body and one side of the crystal is electrically coupled to the other end of the central electrode 144 . A deforming device 124 is also included within the body to deform the crystal 100 and cause it to produce and apply an electrical signal to the central electrode 144 . This electrical signal produces a spark between the central and ground electrode similar to a conventional spark plug. The deforming device can include a striker element for striking the crystal to deform it, a second low voltage piezoelectric crystal 124 coupled to the first mentioned piezoelectric crystal 100 so that when a low voltage signal is applied to the second crystal 124 it deforms to thereby deform the first piezoelectric crystal 100 , a solenoid disposed in the body to strike or apply a force to the piezoelectric crystal to deform it in response to a low voltage signal, or other suitable deforming devices.
