# Outer arm assembly for industrial robot.

## Abstract
An industrial robot is disclosed which includes three primary drive units 21, 22, 23 defining three separately controlled axes of movement, and an outer arm assembly 16 having three additional drive units 90, 91, 92 for providing three additional axes of movement. The three primary drive units 21, 22, 23 each include an electrical motor which has its rotor 40 and stator 42 each coaxially disposed about the axis of movement A , so as to eliminate the need for any torque converting drive train between the motor and output components. The three drive units 90, 91, 92 of the outer arm assembly comprise three electrical motors, and these three motors are serially mounted, with the rotors 110 and stators 112 thereof being coaxially disposed about a common axis, and with the rotors being fixed to respective ones of three coaxially mounted tubular members 98, 99, 100 , which serve to transmit movement to the workpiece engaging gripper 19 of the robot.
