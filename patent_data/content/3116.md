# Composite compact components fabricated with high temperature brazing filler metal, method and apparatus for making same.

## Abstract
A component 11 is comprised of a composite compact 13 made of a layer of bonded diamond or boron nitride particles 19 and a base layer of cemented carbide 21 bonded to the particulate layer 19 , and a substrate 15 bonded to the base layer 20 of the compact with a filler metal 17 having a liquidus temperature greater than the degradation temperature of the particulate layer 19 . The component is fabricated by heating the base layer 21 , filler metal 17 and substrate 15 to a temperature in excess of the degradation temperature while maintaining the temperature of the particulate layer 19 below the degradation temperature via a heat sink. A preferred embodiment of the component is a cutter for a drill bit.
