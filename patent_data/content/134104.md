# INTEGRAL PHOTOSENSITIVE OPTICAL DEVICE

## Abstract
An integral optical device characterised in that it is com posed of a body of photosensitive glass having an optical pat tern developed therein by a spatially varying property due to formation of colloidal metal particles and or a crystalline micro phase nucleated by such particles is disclosed. For example, in one specific embodiment, the pattern is composed of at least one transparent lens system having a ra dial gradient refractive index distribution of prescribed nature. The accompanying drawing illustrates an interferogram of such a lens pattern. The present invention offers advantages improvements over the prior art.
