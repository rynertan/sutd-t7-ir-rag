## Description
VECTOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a novel vector. More particularly, it relates to a vector characterized by at least one promoter region occurring therein between two restriction enzyme cleavage sites respectively recognized by two different restriction enzymes but giving upon cleavage the same cohesive end.2. Description of the Prior Art The promoter is a regulating factor which controls the genetic information to be borne by RNA. It serves as a site to be recognized by RNA polymerase and as a site of binding of RNA polymerase and, as the RNA synthesis start point, plays a very important role in protein synthesis. The lac promoter, trp promoter and ss lactamase promoter are promoters known to be markedly efficient in phenotypic expression in Escherichia coli as a host. Studies in search of a more potent promoter were pursued and brought about hybrid promoters, for instance.The tac promoter composed of the trp promoter and lac promoter, for instance, is a well known hybrid promoter. As promoters for which yeasts serve as hosts, there may be mentioned the PGK promoter, ADH promoter and phoE promoter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In search of a more potent promoter, the present inventors conducted investigations into promoters each comprising a plurality of promoters connected in series. As a result, they found that the provision of vectors containing a promoter region between two restriction enzyme cleavage sites respectively recognized by two different restriction enzymes but giving, upon cleavage, the same cohesive end makes it possible to construct vectors each containing a plurality of promoters in series and have now completed the present invention. Thus, the present invention is concerned with vectors characterized by at least one promoter region occurring therein between two restriction enzyme cleavage sites respectively recognized by two different restriction enzymes but giving, upon cleavage, the same cohesive end.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, to have the same cohesive end means that the portions rendered singlestranded upon restriction enzyme cleavage have the same base sequence. For instance, the BglZ recoginition sequence is 5 A G A T C T 3 3 T C T A G A 5 and, upon cleavage, 5 G A T C 3 becomes the cohesive end. On the other hand, the BamHI recognition sequence is 5 G G A T C C 3 3 C C T A G G 5 and, upon cleavage, 5 G A T C 3 becomes the cohesive end. Other restriction enzyme combinations which give the same cohesive end are SalI and XhoI, and BamHI and BclI. The above fact makes possible the connection of both ends hereinafter referred to as ligation . This ligation sites is no more cleavable by the two enzymes used previously due to the difference between both the enzyme recognition sites. Taking advantage of this characteristic property, it is possible to prepare multiple promoters.For example, the BamHI and Bugle cohesive ends, when ligated together, give the sequence 5 G G A T C T 3 3 C C T A G A 51 and this site, which now the MboI cleavage site, cannot be cleaved with BamHI or BgllE any more. The SalI and XhoI cohesive ends, when ligated together, give the sequence 5 G T C G A G 3 3 C A G C T C 5 . This sequence is the TaqI cleavage site and therefore can no more be cleaved with SalI or XhoI. In accordance with the invention, an operator region and an SD sequence can be present, together with the promoter region, between two different restriction enzyme recognition sites. The operator region is a region which regulates the synthesis of mRNA corresponding to the adjacent structural gene through the interaction with a specific repressor, and the SD sequence is a ribosome binding site and is located in the neighborhood of and upstream from the protein synthesis initiation site. The vector thus provided in accordance with the invention can serve as a basic form of multiple promoters.It is expected that by constructing multiple promoters using said vector, more efficient protein synthesis by genetic engineering becomes possible. Construction of multiple promoter The term multiple promoter as used herein means a plurality of repeatedly occurring, adjacent promoters. It may contain an operator and an SD sequence therein. When said operator and SD sequence are not contained in the promoter, the operator and SD sequence should be present in adjacency to and downstream from the multiple promoter. Connecting a number of promoters in the above manner can lead to increased mRNA transcription efficiency. The trp promoter is a promoter which enables efficient production of polypeptides and, when rendered multiple, can give a promoter capable of giving very high yields. As one of the trp promoter, there may be mentioned a promoter having the sequence CCCTGTTGACAATTAATCATCGAACTAGTTAACTAGTACGCAAG ...... Taq I 35 10 Hinc z Hpa I Rsa I TTCACGTAAAAAGGGTATC SD This promoter is prepared from pDR720 available fromPL Biochemical and pGX112 available from Genex . Although pDR720 has no SD sequence, the elements 35 region, 10 region and SD sequence, which are essential to the expression of genetic information, can be obtained by deriving therefrom a recombinant with pGX112. Said promoter has a size of about 70 bp and can easily be excised for use in heterologous gene expression. Hybrid promoters can induce production of desired polypeptides in high yields and with high regulatability.For example, there may be mentioned the tac promoter which is a hybrid between the trp promoter and lac promoter, and the hybrid promoter between the rrn promoter and lac promoter. The tac promoter comprises the trp ptomoter derived 35 region RNA polymerase recognition site and the lac promoter derived 10 region RNA polymerase binding site,Pribnow box and allows polypeptide production in high yields. The tac promoter also has the lac promoter derived operator and SD sequence, is controlled by the lactose repressor, and is advantageous in that it is very easily regulatable. By making this tac promoter multiple, there can be obtained a highly regulatable promoter capable of affording very high polypeptide yields. Such multiple tac promoter can be produced by deriving a basic vector, pTLl, from pDR540 available from PLBiochemical . A structural gene is inserted into the thus obtained plasmid vector at a restriction enzyme cleavage site downstream from the promoter operator hereinafter abbreviated as P O and a host is transformed with the insertion product, whereby the expression of said gene becomes possible. A preferred host is Escherichia coli. Examples of the vector according to the invention are described below. The DNA digestion and ligation are carried out by mixing necessary DNA or DNAs and enzyme or enzymes with an appropriate buffer for reaction digestion or ligation to prepare 50 100 pQ of a reaction mixture having a final DNA concentration of about 1 pg Q and allowing the reaction to proceed for 2 hours to overnight.Enzymes are used in an amount of about 3 units per 1 pg ofDNA.

Thus, pDR540 was digested with HindIII, followed by phenol chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol.The precipitate obtained was dissolved in sterile water, heated at 650C for 3 minutes and then used for the preparation of the following reaction mixture Reaction mixture pDR540 Hindu cut 150 pQ 10 x Nick translation buffer 20 pQ 2mM each of dNTP four kinds 10 l each DNA polymerase large fragment 20 pQ 15 units Composition of 10 x Nick translation buffer 0.5M Tris HC, pH7.2 0.1M MgSO4 lmM dithiothreitol The above reaction mixture was kept at room temperature 28 300C for 40 minutes. To the reaction mixture obtained were added 100 l of water saturated redistilled phenol and 100 l of chloroform. After 30 seconds of vigorous vortexing, the mixture was centrifuged for 2 minutes.The aqueous phase 200 pQ was taken and subjected to precipitation with ethanol. The precipitate was washed with 70 ethanol and dried. The dried precipitate was dissolved in 38 pQ of water, then 5 g 5 pQ of BglI linker Takara Shuzo s phosphorylated Bugle linker d pCAGATCTG I was added, and the mixture was heated at 650C for 3 minutes and cooled at room temperature. Reaction mixture Above DNA mixture 43 pQ 10 x T4 ligase buffer 5 l T4 ligase 2 pQ 5.6 units The above reaction mixture was kept at 16 C overnight to effect ligation of the BglE linker. The DNA obtained was digested with BglI, the resultant reaction mixture was electrophoresed on 1 agarose, and a DNA band corresponding to about 4,000 bp was recovered by electroelution G.Dretzen, H. Bellard, P. Sassone Corsi, and P. Chambon 1981 ,Anal. Biochem., 112, 295 298 . The DNA fragment thus obtained was ligated by the conventional method. The plasmid obtained was used for transformation of E. coli JM103. Transformant selection was performed making advantage of ampicillin resistance, and DNA was extracted therefrom. The DNA obtained was subjected to Buzz digestion, Hindu digestion, EcoRI BglE double digestion hereinafer, EcoRI BglI digestion , BglE EcoRI digestion, and BamHI EcoRI digestion, followed by 5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which confirmed formation of a pDR540 derived plasmid containing a Bugle cleavage site in lieu of the original Hindi cleavage site. Said plasmid was named pTL1 Fig. 1 . The thus obtained pTLl had BglE and BamHI as two different restriction enzyme cleavage sites and had a tacP O between them. This pTL1 was then digested with EcoRI BamHI to give a tac P O containing fragment having a size of about 380 bp. Separately, pTLl was digested with EcoRI BglI to give a fragment about 4 kb in size. These two fragments were ligated together, and E. coli JM103 was transformed with the ligation product, followed by transformant selection by means of ampicillin resistance. More than 10,000 transformants were obtained. From 47 of them, plasmid DNA was extracted by the miniprep method H. C.Birnboim and J. Doly 1979 , Nucl. Acids Res., 7, 1513 and digested with BamHI BglI , whereby a fragment about 200 bp in size was obtained from 45 out of the 47 transformants. Plasmid DNA was extracted in large amounts from such transformants and digested with BamHI Belle, EcoRI BamHI, and EcoRI BglI . The results of the digestions are shown in Table 1. These plasmids each is a plasmid having a double tac P O, which plasmid was named pTL2. Then, the 380 bp fragment as obtained by EcoRI BamHI digestion of pTLl and the 4 kb fragment as obtained by EcoRI Bugle digestion of pTL2 were ligated together and the ligation product was used for transformation ofE. coli JM103. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave more than 10,000 transformants, of which 30 were subjected to plasmid DNA extraction by the miniprep method, followed by BamHI BglZ digestion. The plasmid DNA from 29 transformants gave a fragment about 300 bp in size.These plasmids were prepared in large amounts and subjected to the same restriction enzyme digestions as applied to pTL2. The results obtained are shown in Table 1. These plasmids each is a plasmid having a triple tac P O. The plasmid was named pTL3 Fig. 2 .

The scheme for preparation is outlined in Fig. 3. 1 Preparation of pYNl pGX 112 was subjected to EcoRI PvulE PstI digestion, which was performed in the conventional manner, followed by 1 agarose electrophoresis. A band corresponding to 2.95 kb a band in which a trp promoter region was present was recovered by the method of Yang et al. R. C. A. Yang, L. Lis, and R. Wu 1979 , Methods inEnzymology, 68, 176 182 . pBR322 was likewise digested with EcoRI PvuE SalI and a 2.25 kb band was reovered by electroelution. Then, the two DNA fragments obtained were ligated together by the conventional method. After ligation, E.coli RR1 was transformed with the product. From the transformants obtained, plasmid DNA was extracted by the miniprep method. The DNA as it was in the cccDNA form was electrophoresed on 1 agarose, and a 5.2 kb plasmid expected from calculation to be the desired one was obtained from 1 out of 20 transformants . This plasmid DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme HpaI, followed by 5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As a result, 230 and 320 bp fragments characteristic of the base sequence in the neighborhood of trpP O were obtained. The plasmid was named pYN1. For pYNl, a restriction enzyme map was prepared.Fig. 4 is a partial representation of said map. This pYNl was examined for DNA sequence around the trp P O region by the Maxam Gilbert method Fig. 5 . The base sequence each of the 35 region, 10 region and SD sequence was in agreement with the data in the following references oJ. D. Windass, C. R. Newton, J. De Maeyer Guignard, V. E. Moore, A. F.

Biol., 121, 193 217 2 Preparation of pYN3 For the purpose of preparing a more compact trp P O, the portion from the AluI site to the TaqI 2 site as shown in Fig. 5 was isolated. Thus, pYNl was first digested with AluI to give a trp P O region containing fragment about 340 bp in size Fig. 6 .To each end of this fragment was joined a Hindu linker Takara Shuzo s phosphorylated HindIII linker d pCAAGCTTG J by overnight reaction at 16 C in the reaction mixture given below.

The thus obtained Hindm TaqI fragment of pYNl was inserted into pBR322 at the Clal HindlE site. Then, E. coli RR1 and E. coli HB101 were transformed with the plasmid obtained. Transformant selection was performed taking advantage of ampicillin resistance, giving more than 10,000 E. coli RR1 transformants and about 300 E. coli HB101 transformants. Plasmid DNA was extracted from 120 transformants by the miniprep method, cleaved with paI, electrophoresed on 1 agarose and examined for the presence of a HpaI site within the trpP O region. As a result, two clones were estimated to have such HtaI site and therefore digested with various restriction enzymes and then electrophoresed. The map of restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the neighborhood of the trp P O as expected from the cleavage pattern found is shown in Fig. 6.These plasmid DNAs were lacking in HincE site which must be present in the 35 region, but the 10 region and SD sequence were actually present therein. These plasmids were named pYN3. 3 Preparation of pYN4 It was decided that the SD sequence deficient trp P O of pDR720 and the SD sequence of pYN3 be connected at the HpaI site. Thus, pDR720 was digested with HpaI Hindu, followed by electrophoresis on 5 polyacrylamide gel, whereby a band corresponding to about 60 bp was eluted. Separately, pYN3 was digested with HpaI Hindu and then treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase hereinafter, BAP BRL . The HpaI HindIE fragment about 60 bp from pDR720 and the HpaI HindIE fragment about 4 kb from pYN3 were ligated together, and the ligation product was used for transformation of E. coli HB101. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave 13 transformants. DNA was extracted from these transformants by the miniprep method and subjected to Hindu ClaI digestion and HindIII ClaI HpaI digestion. With all clones, a fragment about 58 bp in size and a fragment about 32 bp in size were obtained. Based on this fact, it was considered that the desired plasmid was in hand. This plasmid was extracted in large amounts and, based on cleavage patterns obtained by digesting it with various restriction enzymes, its restriction enzyme cleavage map was prepared Fig. 7 . The plasmid was named pYN4. 4 Preparation of pYN5 Then, the following experiment was carried out to make this trp P O region present between Bugle and BamHI sites. pYN4 was digested with EcoRI ClaI to give a fragment about 66 bp in size. Separately, pBR322 was digested withEcoRI ClaI and then treated with BAP, giving a fragment about 4 kb in size. These two fragments were ligated together, and E. coli HB101 was transformed with the ligation product. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave 22 transformants, from each of which DNA was extracted by the miniprep method and digested with EcoRI ClaI. All clones gave a 60 70 bp fragment. One of the clones was named pYNS. 5 Preparation of pYN6 To convert the ClaI site of pYNS to a BamHI site, pYN5 was digested with BamHI ClaI. The single stranded portion at each site was converted to a complementary double strand using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment NEB to give a fragment about 4 kb in size. This fragment was subjected to ligation and the product was used for transforming E.coli HB101. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave 27 transformants. The DNA plasmid from 14 out of these was cleavable with BamHI but not cleavable with ClaI.Therefore, it was concluded that said plasmid was the desired one, and its restriction enzyme cleavage map was examined Fig. 8 . The plasmid was named pYN6. Furthermore, the base sequence of the trp P O region of pYN6 was studied by the Maxam Gilbert method. It was revealed that the trp P O region of pYN6 contained the 35 region, 10 region and SD sequence. Upon EcoRI BamHI digestion, said region could be excised as a fragment having a size of about 70 bp Fig. 9 . 6 Preparation of pYN7 In the next place, an attempt was made to convert theEcoRI site of pYN6 to a Bugle site. Thus, pYN6 was treated with EcoRI and then with SI nuclease, and the singlestranded portion was rendered double stranded using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment. Thereafter, in the same manner as above, a Bugle linker was joined thereto, followed by treatment with BglZ and ligation. E. coli HB101 was transformed with the ligation product. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave more than 10,000 transformants.Of 40 of said transformants, one was cleavable with BglIE but uncleavable with EcoRI and found to be the desired plasmid. It was named pYN7. 7 Preparation of pYN8, pYN9 and pYN10 pYN7 was digested with BglI BamHI to give a fragment about 70 bp in size. Separately, pTLl of Example 1 was subjected to BglI BamHI digestion and treatment withBAP, which gave a fragment about 4 kb in size. These two fragments were ligated together, and the ligation product was used for transforming E. coli HB101. By selection using ampicillin resistance, more than 10,000 transformants were obtained. Out of 54 transformants investigated, 13 gave plasmid DNA cleavable with both Bugle and BamHI. The plasmid DNA was further subjected to BglI BamHI digestion, and BglI BamHI HpaI digestion.As a result, the plasmidDNA from 8 clones named pYN8 , upon Bugle BamHI digestion, gave a fragment about 75 bp in size. The BglE BamHI HpaI digestion led to disappearance of the band corresponding to about 75 bp. The plasmid DNA from other 3 clones named pYN9 gave, upon BglE BamHI digestion, a fragment about 165 bp in size and, upon BglI BamHI HpaI digestion, a fragment about 75 bp in size. The plasmid DNA for a further clone named pYNlO gave, upon B21 BamHI digestion, a fragment about 240 bp in size and, upon BglI BamHI HpaI digestion, a fragment about 75 bp in size. Each clone was cultured on a large scale and plasmidDNA was prepared by the cleared lysate method. The plasmidDNA was digested with various restriction enzymes, followed by electrophoresis. The size of each fragment obtained was determined. The restriction enzyme cleavage maps obtained in this manner are shown in Fig. 10. pYN8 was a plasmid serving as a basic form of multiple trp P O, whereas pYN9 and pYN10 were double trp P O and triple trp P O containing plasmids, respectively.Example 3 Preparation of multiple trp promoter 1 Preparation of pYN20 The procedure was as outlined in Fig. 11. The plasmid pYNS prepared in Example 2 was subjected to ClaI SalI digestion, followed by 1 agarose electrophoresis and electroelution, which gave a fragment about 3.8 kb in size. Its cohesive ends were filled in using DNA polymerase IKlenow fragment in the presence of the four dNTPs. The subsequent ligation using T4 DNA ligase led to disappearance of the ClaI site and regeneration of a SalI site. Using the resultant DNA, E. coli HB101 was transformed. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave more than 10,000 transformants, from 24 of which plasmid DNA was extracted by the miniprep method. The DNA was divided into two portions. One portion was digested with SalI and the other with ClaI, followed by 1 agarose electrophoresis in each case. The plasmid from 13 transformants was cleavable with SalI but uncleavable with ClaI and therefore was the desired plasmid, and was named pYN20. 2 Preparation of pYN21 For converting the EcoRI site of pYN20 to a XhoI site, the procedure outlined in Fig. 12 was followed. Thus, pYN20 was digested with EcoRI, followed by phenol chloroform extraction and precipitation with ethanol. The DNA thus obtained was treated with SI nuclease for cohesive end digestion. Three phenol chloroform extractions followed by ethanol precipitation gave a precipitate, which was dissolved in sterile water, heated at 650C for 3 minutes and then cooled rapidly. Thereafter, treatment with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment was conducted in the presence of 4 dNTPs, followed by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and further by ligation of a XhoI linker Takara Shuzo s XhoI linker d CCTCGAGG .After the subsequent digestion with XhoI, the digest was electrophoresed on 1 agarose and a fragment about 3.8 kb in size was electroeluted. This fragment was ligated using T4 DNA ligase and the ligation product was used for transformingE. coli HB101. Selection through ampicillin resistance gave more than 10,000 transformants, 24 of which were subjected to plasmid DNA extraction. The DNA was divided into two portions. One portion was digested with XhoI and the other with EcoRI. The DNA from 3 transformants was not digestible with EcoRI but was digestible with XhoI and found to be the desired one. This was named pYN21. 3 Preparation of multiple trp promoter The procedure followed was as outlined in Fig. 13.Thus, pYN21 was digested with XhoI SalI. The subsequent 5 polyacrylamide electrophoresis gave a fragment about 75 bp in size. Separately, pYN21 was digested with XhoI and then treated with BAP. Three repetitions of phenol chloroform extraction and the subsequent ethanol precipitation gave a precipitate, which was ligated with the 75 bp fragment. E. coli HB101 was transformed with the ligation product. Upon selection by means of ampicillin resistance, more than 10,000 transformants were obtained.From 20 of them, plasmid DNA was extracted and digested with XhoI SalI and with HpaI. Each digest was treated with RNase and electrophoresed on 5 polyacrylamide gel. The DNA from 4 transformants gave a fragment about 160 bp in size upon XhoI SalI digestion and a fragment about 75 bp in size upon HpaI digestion. This plasmid was estimated to contain a double trp promoter, and named pYN22. pYN22 was then prepared in large amount, digested withXhoI SalI and electrophoresed on 5 polyacrylamide gel.A fragment about 160 bp in size was thus obtained. This fragment was ligated with the XhoI fragment from pYN21 mentioned hereinabove and the product was used for transforming E. coli HB101. Selection by means of ampicillin resistance gave about 1,000 transformants. From 30 of them, plasmid DNA was extracted and digested with XhoI SalI and with HpaI. The plasmid DNA from one transformant gave a fragment about 230 bp in size upon XhoI SalI digestion and a fragment about 75 bp in size upon HpaI digestion. This was the desired plasmid containing a triple trp P O, and was named pYN23.
