## Description
WIND MOTOR PROVIDED WITH A DEVICE FOR ITS AUTOMATIC ALIGNMENTWITH THE WIND This invention relates to a wind motor, in particular for operating an electrical generator, provided with an isaproved device for its automatic alignment with the wind.Wind motors usually comprise a rotor with opposing blades, a nacelle carrying the rotor and disposed rotatable on the top of a tower or pylon of suitable height, and a hub vhich connects together the rotor blades and is either rigid or, preferably, swivel mounted, ie able to allow the rotor to make limited rotations about the nacelle axis in the horizontal plane.To obtain xaximum efficiency from said wind motors or aeromotors which are also known as aerogenerators when they drive an electrical generator for electricity production it is known to be necessary to maintain the plane of rotation of the rotor substantially perpendicular to the vind direction, and thus various devices have been developed for keeping the aeromotor or aerogenerator constantly aligned with the wind, by causing the nacelle to rotate on its support during a wind change ie a change in the wind direction on the site on which the aeromotor is located .The most simple of these devices, which can be used with good effectiveness only for small aerogenerators, is constituted by a tail rudder which is mounted on the nacelle at the opposite end to the rotor. This system is hardly effective for aerogenerators with a power exceeding a few tens of a kilowatt, and the relatively large dimensions required for the tail rudder are such that the cost, weight and overall size of the system are unacceptable. and thus automatic wind alignment systems of the so called active type have been constructed, in the for of sotorised devices controlled by weans sensitive to the yaw angle.In the description given hereinafter the tem yaw angle dignifies the angle between the longitudinal arts of the nacelle and the wind direction, ie the angle of deviation of the nacelle fros the position in which it vould be aligned vith the wind.One of the known active systems consists of at least one pair of propellers of horizontal axis arranged to rotate in planes perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the rotor. and disposed oh opposite sides of the nacelle carrying the rotor. These propellers are arranged for operation by any wind component transverse to the nacelle, and are therefore operated only when this latter is not coaxial with the wind, ie when the yaw angle is other than zero.Such propellers are connected by g train of step down gears to a worm which engages with a helical gear rigid with the tower which supports the nacelle. Consequently when the wind changes, it produces a non zero transverse component, which by operating the propellers causes the vorm to rotate, which then rotates the nacelle about the tower in such a direction as to nullify the yaw angle.Apart froi its relatively high cost and constructional complexity, this system has the drawback of correcting the nacelle direction too slowly.One object of the present invention is to provide a wind motor, in particular for driving an electrical generator, of the type comprising a rotor with a swivel mounted hub and a device for automatic alignment with the vind, which is of high efficiency and relatively low cost, and is able to prevent any impact against the limit stops andlor loss of power of the rotor. A further object of the present invention is to provide d wind rotor comprising a device for its automatic alignment with the vind which acts in a reduced tine.The said objects are attained according to the present invention by a wind motor, in particular for operating an electrical generator, of the type comprising a rotor with a swivel mounted hub, a nacelle carrying said rotor, and s device for automatically aligning said nacelle with the wind in order to keep the plane of rotation of the rotor substantially perpendicular to the vind direction, characterised in that said alignment device comprises a wind direction sensor disposed upwind of said rotor and arranged to continuously sense the yaw angle of the nacelle first oceans for setting and varying the cyclic pitch of said rotor by differential variation of the setting angle of the blades thereof and second cants which, when a yaw angle exceeding a predetermined value is sensed by said sensor, cause the first earns to operate in such a manner as to sake said plane of rotation of the rotor rotate about r substantially vertical axis in the same direction as that of the angular displacement undergone by the wind direction which has defined the yaw angle sensed by said sensor.The present invention will be more apparent from the non limiting description of one embodiment thereof given hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is r diagra atic illustration of the operation of an aerogenerator constructed in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a diagra atic illustration of the automatic wind alignment device of the Mro.otor according to the present invention and Figure 3 is a section on the line Ill Ill of the device of Figure 2. In Figure 1, the reference nuneral 1 indicates overall a wind Doctor of the type comprising a rotor 2 with two opposing blades 3 and a svivel ounted hub 4, a nacelle 5 mounted rotatable at 6 on the top of a tower 7, and a device for automatically aligning the nacelle 5 vith the wind, this device being not visible in that it is preferably housed inside said nacelle 5 andlor hub 4, and of which only a wind direction sensor 8 can be seen disposed on the nacelle 5 upwind of the rotor 2, so as to be able to continuously sense, before the wind strikes the blade 3, the yaw angle of the nacelle 5 to the vind direction, indicated by the arrows 9 by vhich the nacelle 5 is aligned vith the vind direction, and thus the angle is zero and 9a by which the nacelle 5 is out of alignment vith the wind direction following a wind change , ie r change in the direction thereof . The sensor 8 is of knovn type substantially of arrow configuration, and is therefore not described for simplicity. In Figure 3, the reference numeral 10 indicates a coupling of known type, which enables the axis of the swivel mounted hub 4, which coincides with the axis of rotation of the rotor 2, to undergo an angular displacement, at least along an arc of predetermined amplitude, about the axis of rotation 11 of a shaft 12 to vhich the rotor 2 is fixed.The axis 11 coincides with the longitudinal axis of the 5, and the coupling 10 is arranged to transmit the drive torque fron the rotor 2 to the shaft 12, which is arranged to operate, for example, an electrical generator housed inside the nacelle 3. In particular, the coupling 10 comprises a pin 13 inserted transversely through the shaft 12 and disposed perpendicular to the axis 11, on said pin 13 there being rotatably pivoted the hub 4, vhich is of forked configuration.With reference also to Figure 2. the rotor 2 of the wind motor ccor ding to the invention is of the type comprising variable pitch blades 3, and said automatic wind alignment device comprises, in addiction to the sensor 8, 8 mechanical device 14 for setting and varying the cyclic pitch of the rotor 2.In particular, the blades 3 are supported by respective thrust bearings 15 mounted rotatable on the ovivel mounted hub 4 so as to be able to rotate about an axis substantially transverse to the axis of rotation thereof, so as to vary the setting angle of the blades 3, and the device 14 is arranged to determine a cyclic pitch of the rotor 2 with a horizontal nodal axis, and comprises an oscillating element 16 mounted coaxially and annularly rigid vith the rotor 2, support means for the element 16 arranged to enable it to swivel about a substantially vertical axis 17 vhich is substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the rotor 2, articulated transmission elements preferably constituted by a connecting rod 18 for each blade 3 and arranged to peripberally connect the element 16 to the respective thrust bearings 15, and a mechanical control device 19 of irreversible type, arranged to cause the element 16 to rotate about said support means.In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, the shaft 12 is housed rotatable inside tubular support frame 21 forming part of the nacelle 5 or rigidly fixed thereto, and thus fixed with respect to the rotational movement of the rotor 2 about its axis. on the frame 21 there is slideably mounted a sleeve 22, which is sade annularly rigid with the frame 21 by seans of an articulated element 23, and which is therefore fixed with respect to the rotational movement of the rotor 2.On the sleeve 22 there is mounted s ring 24 vhich swivels about the axis 17 and is pivoted to the sleeve 22 by means of s pair of vertical pins 25 coaxial with the axis 17. Said oscillating element 16 is idly mounted on the ring 24 by vay of rolling bodies 26, and in the illustrated example is constituted by a further ring coaxial with the ring 24 and having the connecting rods 18 hinged to its periphery.A further articulated element 27, similar to 23, saku the ring 16 angularly rigid vith the rotor 2 while allowing it to undergo axial transitory movements together with the sleeve 22. The ring 24 is provided with an am 28 rigid therewith and projecting axially therefrom, said am 28 engaging the control device 19, which is also carried by the sleeve 22.The axial translation of this latter is controlled by known devices, not shown for siwplicity, governed by the control system for the collective pitch of the rotor 2, of knows type and not shown for simplicity From the aforegoing, it is apparent that if the sleeve 22 is nade to translate along the frame 21, the setting angle of the blades 3 changes by identical values, thus enabling the collective pitch of the rotor 2 to be controlled, so as to regulate the power delivered thereby, whereas by rotating the ring 24 about the pins 25, it is apparent that the ring 16 is sade to rotate about the axis 17 and thus move through opposing distances the connecting rods 18 controlling the setting angle of the blades 3 when said connecting rods 18 are contained in a horizontal plane passing through the axis 21, thus causing the setting angle of the blade. 3 to vary differently when these are disposed vertically.In this respect, according to the invention and as shown in Figure 3 the connecting rods 18 are hinged to the blades 3 by way of curved appendices 18 of the thrust bearings 15, which are configured io such a winner as to position the connecting rods 18 with a phase lead of 90. over the blades 3 with respect to the direction of rotation of the rotor 2, indicated by the yarrow in Figure 3. In this sanner, a cyclic pitch vith a horizontal nodal axis is set on the rotor 2, ie a continuous variation of the setting angle of the blades 3 is obtained as a function of their angular position about the axis of the hub 4, between a position of saxiiiui phase difference between the setting angles of the opposing blades 3 when these are vertical, and a position of substantially zero phase difference when these are disposed horizontally. It is also apparent that by varying the angle of rotation or swivel of the ring 16 about the axis 17, the cyclic pitch of the rotor 2 can be consequently varied continuously at will, ie the extent of the phase difference in the setting angle of the opposing blades 3 when in their vertical position can be varied at will. According to the invention, the direction and extent of the rotation of the ring 16 about the axis 17 and consequently the sign and extent of the cyclic pitch modulation are controlled by the device 19, which comprises a double acting cylinder piston unit 29, a cam 30 housed in a seat 31 provided in the am 28 and connected by a radial arm 32 to the cylinder piston unit 29, and a pin 33 inserted into the sleeve 22 and by means of which the cain 30 is rotatably connected to said sluve. Clearly, on operating the cylinder piston unit 29 the Cal 30 is caused to rotate in the seat 31, consequently rotating the ring 24 and the relative coaxial ring 16 about the axis 17, to produce the required variation in the cyclic pitch of the rotor 2.According to the invention, the device 19 also comprises r second CM 34, the purpose of which is to correct the aerodynamic effects due to the atmospheric boundary layer and which, according to the invention, idly carries said cam 30 in its interior and is itself idly housed in the seat 31.Said cam 34 is arranged to be rotated sanully by an operator and or by means of a suitable servo control of any known type, not shown for siwplicity, and enables a cyclic pitch of constant predetermined value to be set independently of the operation of the cylinder piston unit 29, by virtue of the fact that, in c like sanner to the rotation of the cam 30, its rotation produces a rotation of the entire assembly constituted by the rings 24 and 16 on the pins 25.Finally, the automatic alignment device according to the invention comprises a slide valve 35, for example of any known spool type, arranged to feed fluid under pressure to the cylinder piston unit 29 through suitable pipes 36 indicated by dashed lines, from a suitable source of pressurised fluid, constituted for example by the hydraulic circuit of the aeromotor 1.The spool of the slide valve 35 is controlled directly by the rotation of the sensor 8, and according to the invention the slide valve 35 is arranged to operate the cylinder piston unit 29 in such a runner as to cause the cyclic pitch of the rotor 2 to vary by an amount of such a sign and value as to cause the blades 3 to flap by aerodynamic affect about the shaft 12 and the relative axis 11 t the sane sign as the sign of the yaw angle A sensed by the sensor 8, so as to cause the plane of rotation of the rotor 2 to rotate about a vertical axis in the same sense as that in which the wind direction has rotated in order to define the angle d. In order to give stability to the control system in the case of snaIl and rapid variations in the wind direction, the sensor 8 is obviously provided in known manner vith s degree of insensitivity of predetermined value, so that it controls the operation of the cylluder piston unit 29 only on sensing a yaw angle exceeding a predetermined value.The operation of the vind motor according to the invention will now be described with reference to Figure 1. When in its normal running state, the aeromotor 1 of the invention has the configuration shown in Figure 1, with the nacelle 5 coaxial to the wind direction 9, the yaw angle d equal to zero and the rotor 2 upwind of the support tower 7 and coaxial to the wind direction 9 and to the axis 11 of the shaft 12 and nacelle 5, with consequent substantially zero flapping of the blades 3. If a wind change now takes place in a clockwise direction and the new wind direction is 9a, this will no longer be coaxial to the nacelle 5, but will form a positive yaw angle d to the axis 11.This wind change is lBmodiately sensed by the sensor 8, both because of its position upwind of the rotor 2, and because of its reduced mass, and it therefore rotates in a clockvise direction until it is coaxial to the new vind direction.If the angle of rotation of the sensor 8 exceeds said predetermined value for example t 10 said displacement causes the spool of the slide valve 35 to move so that this latter feeds pressurised fluid to the cylinder piston unit 29, to cause the ring 16 to rotate in the manner heretofore described in such a direction as to differen tially vary the setting angle of the opposing blades 3, and consequently vary their incidence so as to reduce the lift of the upper blade 3 and in contrast increase the lift of the lower blade 3 when these latter are positioned vertically In this manner, the blades 3 become set to reccive the wind in the new direction 9a, so preventing this wind change inducing on the rotor 2 an aerodynamic moment such as to cause this latter to rotate on the pia 13 in an anticlockwise direction about the tower 7 as would have happened if the cyclic pitch was not varied with the risk of violent impact against the llvit stops of the hub 4 of shown type and not shown for simplicity . According to the invention, the variation in the cyclic pitch of the rotor 2 controlled by the rotation of the sensor 8 is of such an extent as to not only produce the aforesaid effect, but indeed to induce on the rotor 2 an aerodynamic moment acting in a horizontal plane and directed in a clock wise direction it concordant with the direction of the wind change so as to cause the taxis of rotation of the rotor 2 and of the relative hub 4 to undergo an angular displacement such as to form in the horizontal plane an angle P between the axis 11 and the perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the rotor 2 Figure 1 which is concordant with the yaw angle A. This is possible in that a nathenatical analysis of the parameters which determine the lift of the blades 3 shows that this lift can be expressed as a linear second order function of the flap angle p of the blades 3 Figure 1 , namely d 1 where a, b, c and d are constants characteristic of the oachineX and p and p are the second and first derivatives of the angle ss.Developing 1 and taking account of the fact that p ic a function of the angular position of the blades 3 and of the modulation of the cyclic pitch, it can be shown that the rotor 2 suffers the effects which disturb the lift of the blades 3 such as a vind change or cyclic pitch variation with a delay of 90 with respect to the position of the blades 3 at the wonent in vhich the disturbance has occurred.It is therefore apparent that the effect of any change in the incidence of the blades 3 to the wind vhich takes place when these are vertical is felt in the horizontal plane after the blades have rotated through 90 . As the member which controls the position of the blades 3 connecting rods 18 is disposed substantially 90 in advance of the blades, as heretofore stated, it is clear that when the blades reach the vertical plane they are already set to receive the wind from the direction 9a with an angle of incidence such as to produce, after a further 90, and thus when in the hori zonal plane, the said aerodynamic moment vhich enables the plane of rotation of the rotor 2 to be rotated concordantly with the wind rotation, so as to keep it constantly perpendicular to this latter.The clockwise rotation of the rotor 2 also generates on the nacelle 5 a couple having an arm b and a value of F x b, where F is the axial thrust on the rotor 2 due to the wind and b is the distance between the straight line along vhich F acts when the rotor 2 rotates, and the centre of rotation 6 of the nacelle 5. By virtue of this couple, the nacelle 5 is caused to rotate in a clockwise direction until the yaw angle iC nullified, thus auto tically realigning the rotor 2 with the wind.In this respect, following the nullifying of the angle 6 the censor 8 returns to coaxiality with the nacelle 5 to cause the control device 19 to again act and return the cyclic pitch of the rotor 2 to the value vhich it initially held previous to the wind change, thus enabling the rotor 2 to return by aerodynamic effect U heretofore described to a position coaxial to the nacelle 5, thus also wllifylng the angle 0. In this respect it is apparent that an aerodynamic moment is generated in the opposite direction to the preceding, and such as to return the rotor 2 to coaxiality with the nacelle 5 .The advantages of the aeromotor according to the invention are apparent from the aforegoing description, and modifications can be made thereto without leaving the scope of the present invention For example, the device for operating the control device 19, instead of being hydraulic, can be of any other known type, for cxasple pneumatic or electric, or even mechanical by directly connecting the rotation pivot of the sensor 8 to the arm 32 which operates the control 19. Instead of being formed vith cams, this latter can be formed vith any other mechanical device of irreversible type, te able to cause the ring 24 to rotate and then to remain locked in the assumed position even when forces act thereon such as to urge it to rotate in the opposite direction. Finally, from the description it is apparent that the sutosatic alignment device according to the invention also allows compensation of the effect of the atmospheric boundary layer on the operation of the aeromotor 1 according to the invention. This effect is knawn to consist of a disturbance in the lift of the blades when these are in their vertical position, due to the fact that the speed of the wind varies with its distance frown the ground, due precisely to the effect of the atmospheric boundary layer in proximity to the ground. It is therefore apparent that by rotating the cam 34 so as to set a constant cyclic pitch of suitable value and sign for the rotor 2, the lift of the upper blade 3 can be reduced and the lift of the lower blade 3 can be increased so as to exactly compensate for the difference in lift between then due to the different speed at which the vind strikes them.
