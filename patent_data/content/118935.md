# Semiconductor device comprising non volatile storage transistors.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprising storage cells which have a non volatile storage transistor and an access transis tor connected in series therewith, whereby parts of a word bytes can be selected for writing and erasing. By means of a second access transistor, which is added to each storage cell, and by means of switches which are controlled by lines used for driving these second access transistors, the current dissipation is reduced and in non selected storage cells the potential of the insulated control electrodes of the storage transistors is fixed, as a result of which the risk of undesired change of the information content is reduced.
