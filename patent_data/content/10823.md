## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for measuring electrical con ductivity particularly but not solely for use in detecting mastitis in individual quarters of a cow s udder employ the cyclical charge and discharge of a capacitor C1 through liquid in a conductivity cell 9 , the cycle reversing on the potential applied to the capacitor C1 reading a high reference potential and a low reference potential by applying the reference potentials to terminals 10, 15 or sensing leads 32, 33 of electronic devices VC1, VC2 or 31 to cause operation of switches SW1, SW2 or S1, S2 so that the variations in frequency are indications of conductivity of the cell 9 . In one modification a refer ence conductance 30 is included in the circuit during charging of the capacitor 31 and the rate of the time periods of the cycle gives an indication of the conductance of the cell 9 in terms of the reference conductance 30 .
