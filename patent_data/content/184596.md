## Description
A method of printing a substrate. This invention relates to a method of printing a substrate in a pattern with a viscous mass in the form of a foam using a screen printing machine. A similar method is disclosed in the published European patent application 47 559. The disclosure thereof is incorporated herein by reference. In that application, the use of a foam is mentioned at the end. Experience with foams hitherto used for this purpose has taught that the pattern printedin t the substrate loses the foamed form virtually immediately. The foam bubbles burst before or during drying, and the result is that the material fully comes into direct contact with the substrate. In addition there may be a slight degree of migration. In the patent application referred to, the use of highly stable foams is explicitly avoided, because they would not be absorbed by the substrate fast enough. For such fast absorption, a lower foam stability is considered essential. Surprisingly it has now been found that, with the squeegee device described in EP A 47 559, in particular for printing fibrous webs, the use of highly stable foams is quite possible and even may involve a number of technical advantages. The invention is accordingly characterized by using a foam having meta stable foam properties. Preferably, the starting point is such a stable foam that the foam structure is substantially maintained during the application in the substrate and during the subsequent drying. As, during the application of the foam to, or in, the substrate, and during the subsequent transport of the treated substrate, the foam will inevitably be subjected to high shearing forces, a small proportion of the foam cells will loose their original structure and burst. This will generally not be in excess of 10 15 of the cells. In the case of fibrous webs, one factor is the certain depth to which the foam pressed from the rotation screen can penetrate inwardly. When the foam stability is so high that during and after the passage of the screen the shear forces do not result in unduly high destruction of the external foam structure, a screen print in the form of foam is locally left in the substrate.Surprisingly it has been found that, with sufficiently stable foam, it is possible to print with very sharp contours in this manner and that after drying the original foam form can be maintained.While maintaining the advantages that can be gained by printing with foam on the rotation screen printing machine, such as accurate dosage per unit area, economic power consumption, and the possibility of fast switching in production batches, this effect additionally gives the advantages directly related to the external foam form of the printing material. This is best seen when the fibrous web is printed with a binder composition brought into the suitable foam form. It can then be seen that not only the location, but the depth of penetration of the printed foam composition can be accurately controlled. When ejected from the screen, the foam is clearly deposited in the fleece material as an extrusion pillar. By means distribution of this control of the foam all sorts of material effects can be achieved in the final product not only in decorative respect, but also structurally. This opens up the constructive route to new types of fibrous webs. In these structures, the desired combination of properties can be supported by a suitable material selection of binder type, fiber mixture and web structure. The technique of pattern printing by means of dimensionally stable foam compositions opens up the possibility of introducing new structures by a. depositing a sharply defined pattern in the plane of the web. This has a decorative significance, but especially in the case of fibrous webs, also one of surface structure. The binder pattern thus produces a highly flexible web with a limited number of free fibers at the surface.b. operating with internal binder free zones, as viewed cross sectionally of the web, by controlling the depth of penetration of the foam paste. This can be of importance for controlling the absorptive power.c. using this printing technique by adjustment of the squeegee screen system for applying a relief pattern of dimensionally stable foam.d. realizing two fold or multi fold printings on one or both sides of the web before effecting the aftertreatment in the dryer, common to all prints. All this is demonstrated in the examples, without all possibilities being exhaustively dealt with therein. These examples also show that, when using dimensionally stable foam paste by means of the screen printing technique only, is it possible to have two or more printing treatments take place synchronously or one immediately after another, and only then followed by drying. The advantage of this treatment as far as process economy is concerned, is evident. Of course, in at least one of these printings the meta stable foam of the invention should be used. Synchronously printing a flexible, porous, flat structure, such as a fibrous web, with pastes on opposite sides is described in the published European patent application No. 54628. In it, however, it is on the one hand explicitly argued that the two sides should be treated with a different printing technique, and, on the other hand, no use is made of a meta stable, high stability foam at all. It is the very combination of, on the one hand, the method improved with highly stable foam when using the rotary screen other machine according to EP A 47 559 with, on the hand, the possibility of applying a plurality of printing treatments at the same time or in series, which possibility has arisen as a result of the highly stable foam, that the subsequent heat drying treatment can take place for all printing treatments at the same time. The composition of the dimensionally stable foam does not involve any novel particular aspects the high foam stability can be achieved by using features long since known to the art. Thus, in addition to a suitable surfactant, one may provide for a high viscosity, for the addition of foam stabilizers or anti desiccants, for the use of low molecular emulsifiers, and for the use of a high dry content. The dry content should be at least 20 . The higher the content of dry matter, the faster the binder will coagulate upon forced drying, as a result of which the foam structure is maintained. The composition of matter from which the foam is prepared usually comprises Bn dispersion, although it is quite possible to use other solvents or dispersing agents, such as ethyl acetate. Advantageously, water is used as this presents little or no environmental problems. If the binder itself is liquid as can be the case with e.g. epoxy systems or liquidized, reactive waterfree systems, it is also possible to dispense with the solvent. Of importance to the dimensionally meta stable foam, in addition to the composition, is the physical fineness. For the stability it is of importance that the average diameter of the foam bubbles should be less than half the average fiber interspace in the web. The suitability of the foam for the printing process on the rotation screen machine can be evaluated in various ways.Thus, for example, use can be made of a laboratory high speed mixer to beat foam to a certain fineness to be expressed in the density in g l. The higher the density, the coarser the foam bubbles are. The advantageously used values range between 50 and 300 g l. The term meta stable foam as used in this connection means a foam which satisfies the following test. A volume of 1 1 of foam is separated in a measuring cylinder covered, and allowed to stand at 20 C for 24 hours. Evaluation is then effected by measuring the amount of liquid settled. A foam suitable for use in the dimensionally stable foam paste will exhibit no settled liquid after 24 hours. Such a foam is considered meta stable. According to the invention, it is possible to print various substrates. Suitable are, for example, all sorts of textile fabrics, knitted fabrics, for example, a Raschel fabric or a tricot fabric, non wovens whether or not in combination with a fabric scrim, foam structures, for example coarse polyurethane foam, and the like. More in particular it is possible to use a slightly reinforced web such as combined structure of a fibrous web with a network, a woven fabric or a knitted fabric. Another alternative which can be advantageous is the use of a substrate in the form of a textile structure or a foam structure. Suitable textile fabrics are cotton and woollen fabrics, and suitable non wovens are especially fibrous webs made from natural fibers, and fibers of synthetic plastics material, but also fibers of glass,carbon and asbestos. Printing can be effected with all sorts of substances, depending on the final product contemplated. It is not necessary for printing to be effected in a design. It is possible to print the entire surface. Some examples of applications are the binding of a fibrous web, printing a fibrous web in a pattern with a decorative character, decoratively binding a needled web, rendering a substrate water repellent, or, on the other hand, applying a water absorbing layer. The meta stable foam is prepared starting from known components. Generally speaking, the composition from which the foam is made contains water, a binder, a thickener, a surfactant wetting agent , a foam stabilizer and possibly a filler. Depending on the final product contemplated, the composition contains one or more other substances to be applied to the substrate. These may be, for example, pigments, water proofing compounds, compounds providing water absorbency, binders, antioxidants, functional compounds such as carbon black, and the like. Binders suitable for use in the present invention are lower alkylacrylates, styrene butadiene rubber, acrylonitrile rubber, polyurethane, epoxy resins, polyvinylchloride, polyvinylidenechloride and copolymers of vinylidene chloride with other monomers, polyvinyl acetate, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and the like. Optionally these binders can be provided with acidic groups, for example by carboxylating them. A suitable carboxylating agent is for example maleic anhydride. Suitable surfactants are of the anionic or non ionic type, such as soaps, alkyl aryl sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates , ethoxylated fatty acid compounds and the like. As foam stabilizers suitable for use in the present invention the following compounds can be used fatty acid amide condensates, ammonium and potassium stearate, cyclohexanole alkylamino salts of acetic acid, formic acid and propionic acid, tertiary amino oxides and the like. The fillers to be used in connection with the present invention are the usual fillers for foam printing, and comprise pigments, active components such as carbon black, hydrated alumina, blown silica, etc. The particle size of the fillers is preferably at most 201us, as the presence of larger particles can interfere with the process of the invention. The foam composition is to be converted into a metastable foam in known manner, for example, by beating the composition in a high speed mixer with air or another gas. The invention is also directed to a printed substrate produced with the method of the invention. These printed substrates are novel products as set out hereinbefore. In the following Examples I to VI, the use of metastable foam is illustrated.
