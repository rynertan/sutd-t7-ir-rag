# Apparatus for converting successive digital values to analog form.

## Abstract
The apparatus has a circuit AD1, DIV which determines in AD1 the difference D₁, D₂, D₃ or D₄ between two consecu tive digital values supplied with a known time interval bet ween them, and which divides in DIV the difference by N for example, five to provide a divided output d₁, d₂, d₃ or d₄, held in BRG . The divided output for example d₁ is repeatedly added to the first of the two consecutive digital values through AD2, REG1, and REG2 and the successive cumula tive results N, for example five, in number of the additions are delivered to a digital to analog converter DA for conver sion into analog form. A command generation system, for providing an analog command signal, for example in a numerical controlled machine tool, can employ such apparatus for converting suc cessive digital command values into the analog command signal, without abrupt changes in the analog command signal even when consecutive digital command values are substan tially different.
