# Fire detection system with IR and UV ratio detector.

## Abstract
An automatic fire detection system characterized by an extremely low incidence of false alarms utilizes two detec tion channels, one fed by an infrared IR detector and the other by an ultraviolet UV detector. Signal processing electronics in each channel produce a normalized output signal proportional to the power of incident IR and UV radia tion within specific bandwidths. The system features a ratio detector that repeatedly forms a ratio of the normalized IR and UV inputs and compares the ratio to a known range of values for this ratio that are characteristic of a fire. A discri minator connected to the output of the ratio detector generates a fire alarm signal only if the majority of these ratio comparisons are fire indicating. The system also in cludes a feedback loop in the IR processing channel that automatically adjusts the output of the channel to compen sate for time verying background IR radiation such as sun light.
