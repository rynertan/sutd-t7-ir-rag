# Sampled data servo positioning system and sector disk file employing same.

## Abstract
A sampled data servo positioning system employs an actuator 50 to move a member between a current and a target position. Incremental position feedback is provided only at sampling times. The system employs a model 60,61, 64 responsive to a velocity related input signal to produce a continually available model incremental position signal. Phase comparing means 70 indicates phase differences between the model and sampled position signals at the sampling times. The system has two operational configurations in the first of which a source of saturation control signals is connected to the actuator to cause maximum acceleration or deceleration thereof. In this first configuration, the model is forced to track the actuator motion by means of feed forward plus feedback control. The feedforward signal represents actuator performance while the feedback signal is the position signal phase difference. In the second operational configuration, a velocity profile signal is applied to the model and the actuator is forced to track the model by means of feedfoward plus feedback control. The feedback signal is again the position signal phase difference but the feedforward signal is a predetermined signal representing the desired actuator current to execute the velocity profile. The sampled data servo positioning system may be the access motion control system of a sector servo disk file.
