## Description
This invention relates to partially novel high toughness ceramic alloys, and to ceramic bodies of improved toughness containing such ceramic alloys. In like manner to mixtures of two or more metals or nonmetals being termed metal alloys and nonmetal alloys, respectively, mixtures of two or more metal oxides yielding solid solutions have frequently been described as ceramic alloys. One well know example of the latter is stabilized and partially stabilized ZrO₂. With respect to microstructure, two principle types of partially stabilized, polycrystalline ZrO₂ bodies have been discussed in the prior art. The first type is composed of relatively large size 30 100 µm cubic ZrO₂ grains, customarily including a dopant, containing precipitates of ZrO₂ having a tetragonal structure of sub µm size with lower dopant content therewithin, and precipitates of ZrO₂ having a monoclinic and or tetragonal structure of about 1 10 µm in size along the grain boundaries of the cubic grains, thereby yielding a microstructure consisting of a ceramic alloy comprising ZrO₂ and one or more stabilizing agents, with MgO and or CaO and or Y₂O₃ being the most commonly used of such agents. The second type of partially stabilized, polycrystalline ZrO₂ bodies is composed of a ceramic alloy of ZrO₂ with one or more stabilizing agents of sub µm grain size and most typically having a tetragonal structure. This second type of ceramic alloy is frequently a combination of ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃, although CeO₂ has been used, as could combinations of Y₂O₃ with MgO and or CaO. In principle, any number of the rare earth metal oxides would also be operable for alloying. ZrO₂ containing ceramic bodies exhibiting the highest toughness values have involved MgO stabilization to yield the large grain size microstructure described above. Such bodies have demonstrated toughness values in excess of 10 MPa This difference in fracture toughness can be explained on the basis of microstructure. Thus, as was described above, the large grain size bodies not only contain precipitates of sub µm size having a tetragonal structure, but also contain precipitates of larger size 1 10 µm having a tetragonal and or monoclinic structure along the grain boundaries. The tetragonal structure of the larger grained precipitates can transform to the monoclinic polymorph during cooling from the fabrication temperature of the body, or can transform in the stress field set up by a propagating crack. Those relatively large dimensioned precipitates along the grain boundaries of the cubic ZrO₂ that have been transformed into the monoclinic structure are areas of high stress which can act to promote the transformation of the smaller sized precipitates of tetragonal structure within the cubic grains to the monoclinic form. Optical and electron microscopy examinations have indicated the presence of a large zone, i.e., 100 µm, of transformed precipitates both large and small grain around propagating cracks. It is that large zone of transformation which gives rise to the high toughness. In contrast, the microstructures of the second type of partially stabilized ZrO₂ bodies are quite uniform with grain sizes generally varying between about 0.3 1 µm, depending upon firing temperature, time at sintering temperature, particle size of the starting batch materials, and composition. There are no fine grained precipitates formed as each tetragonal grain acts as a single precipitate. There is a lack of development of the large size precipitates along the grain boundaries. As a result, the transformation zone around propagating cracks in this type of body is only on the order of 4 µm or less. It has been mathematically predicted that the level of toughening should be directly proportional to the square root of the dimensions of the transformation zone. The measure of toughness reported above on the two types of bodies qualitatively confirms that prediction. YNbO₄, YTaO₄, MNbO₄, and MTaO₄, where M represents a number of rare earth elements having a valence of 3, are compounds having a monoclinic structure at room temperature R.T. and a tetragonal structure at high temperatures. It is my belief that the lack of easy nucleation for the development of monoclinic ZrO₂ in the fine grained, partially stabilized ZrO₂ bodies limits the number of grains that can transform in the stress field of a propagating crack which, in turn, limits the level of toughness that can be achieved. My invention is based upon the proposition that, through the introduction of YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄ into partially stabilized ZrO₂ bodies, either as a minor second phase or as a solid solution, the nucleation of monoclinic ZrO₂ can be rendered easier, while still maintaining the tetragonal crystal structure at room temperature. This ease of nucleation can then improve the toughness of the final product through one or more of the three postulated mechanisms set out below. The first mechanism assumes the resulting material is composed of two phases, one phase containing a high level of YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄, which transforms to monoclinic symmetry either upon cooling or in the stress field of a propagating crack. This conversion then assists the transformation of adjacent grains of the ZrO₂ rich phase, by either the production of local high stress fields and dislocations from the ends of the transformation twins along the grain boundary between the two phases, or simply by the stress field associated with the entire grain, especially if the volume change upon the transformation is negative. In the first alternative, it is believed that individual grains high in YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄ content behave in like manner to the large dimensioned precipitates along the grain boundaries of the cubic ZrO₂ that have been observed in the microstructures of ceramic alloys having compositions in the ZrO₂ MgO systems. The second mechanism assumes the resulting material is comprised of a single phase solid solution wherein the YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄ adjusts the lattice constants and the anisotropic thermal expansion coefficients of the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of the solid solution such that the elastic energy barrier to the formation of the monoclinic phase is lowered, or the addition of YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄ softens the crystal lattice, thereby lowering the elastic constants and the Peierls stress barrier, and thus ultimately increasing the probability of successful nucleation and growth of monoclinic ZrO₂ in the stress field of a crack with consequent enhanced toughness. The third mechanism involves the production of a ceramic alloy that forms two phases within a single grain by spinodal decomposition or an ordering process, and is deemed to represent an intermediate between the above two mechanisms. Although examination of the products through scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy has indicated that some compositions of the material are composed of two phases, it is believed that the second and third postulated mechanisms may also be operating. Hence, the final mechanism underlying the improved toughness of the final product has not been unequivocally elucidated. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a ceramic body of improved toughness consisting essentially of 5 50 by volume of a ceramic alloy consisting essentially of at least one member of the group of ZrO₂, partially stabilized ZrO₂, ZrO₂ HfO₂ solid solution, partially stabilized ZrO₂ HfO₂ solid solution, partially stabilized HfO₂ and HfO₂ exhibiting high toughness through the inclusion of 0.5 8 mole , as expressed on the oxide basis, of a toughening agent selected from the group of YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄, wherein M represents Mg ², Ca ², Sc ³, and or a rare earth metal selected from the group of La ³, Ce ⁴, Ce ³, Pr ³, Nd ³, Sm ³, Eu ³, Gd ³, Tb ³, Dy ³, Ho ³, Er ³, Tm 3, Yb ³, and Lu ³ which are substituted for Y ³, one 3 cation being substituted for one Y ³ cation, three 2 cations being substituted for two Y ³ cations, and three 4 cations for four Y ³ cations, the microstructure of said alloy consisting predominantly of crystals having a tetragonal structure, with the remainder of the body being a hard refractory ceramic. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided, as a novel ceramic alloy, a ceramic alloy consisting essentially of at least one member of the group of partially stabilized ZrO₂, partially stabilized ZrO₂ HfO₂ solid solution, and partially stabilized HfO₂ exhibiting high toughness through the inclusion of 0.5 5 mole , as expressed on the oxide basis, of a toughening agent selected from the group of YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and or MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄, wherein M represents Mg ², Ca ², Sc ², and or a rare earth metal selected from the group of La ³, Ce ⁴, Ce ³, Pr ³, Nd ³, Sm ³, Eu ³, Gd ³, Tb ³, Dy ³, Ho ³, Er ³, Tm ³, Yb ³, and Lu ³ which are substituted for Y ³, one 3 cation being substituted for one Y ³ cation, three 2 cations being substituted for two Y ³ cations, and three 4 cations for four Y ³ cations, in which said partial stabilization is produced through the inclusion of at least 1.1 mole stabilizer where the amount of toughening agent is between 0.5 4.4 mole and of at least 0.6 mole stabilizer where the amount of toughening agent is between 4.4 5 mole , the microstructure of said alloy consisting predominantly of crystals having a tetragonal structure. The novel ceramic alloy according to the invention may also be defined with reference to FIGURE 2 of the drawings, and according to another aspect of the invention there is provided a ceramic alloy consisting essentially of at least one member of the group of partially stabilized ZrO₂, partially stabilized ZrO HfO₂ solid solution, and partially stabilized HfO₂ exhibiting high toughness, wherein YO According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a ceramic body of improved toughness consisting essentially of greater than 50 and up to 95 by volume of the novel ceramic alloy according to the invention with the remainder of the body being a hard refractory ceramic. In a yet further aspect of the invention there is provided a ceramic composite body of improved toughness consisting essentially of up to 80 by volume refractory ceramic fibers and or whiskers and at least 5 by volume of the novel ceramic alloy according to the invention. Whereas the preferred embodiment of the invention contemplates the addition to ZrO₂ partially stabilized with 0.8 to 9 mole percent YO It will be appreciated that, for some compositions, the niobate and or tantalate can dominate the chemistry of a separate phase, which circumstance has been confirmed through electron microscope examination of the final sintered product, and that the partial stabilization of the ZrO₂ can be achieved through the presence of such known stabilizers as Y₂O₃, CeO₂, MgO, and CaO. To illustrate, YO As a second illustration, for a product consisting of ZrO₂ 8 mole YO As a third example, for a composition such as ZrO₂ 1 mole YO For greater economy, MgO and or CaO can be utilized to stabilize the ZrO₂. In like manner, an excess of the above recited rare earth oxides may be employed for stabilization purposes, but the cost for so doing could be quite high. Electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and x ray diffraction studies of the final inventive products have indicated the presence of tetragonal ZrO₂, cubic ZrO₂, and monoclinic ZrO₂, as well as the second phases dominated by the niobate and or tantalate. It will be understood that the compositions of the above phases may actually be solid solutions of varying concentrations of ZrO₂, Y₂O₃, and Nb₂O₅ and or Ta₂O₅, with the levels of all phases and the compositions of the phases varying with the overall composition and grain size of the inventive products. The ceramic alloys are very useful in enhancing the toughness of hard, refractory ceramics. Hence, as little as 5 by volume of these alloys can impart substantially improved toughness that is to say, the ceramic matrix may comprise up to 95 by volume of the product. Examples of such ceramic matrices include α alumina, β alumina, β alumina, Al₂O₃ Cr₂O₃ solid solutions, mullite, sialon, nasicon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, spinel, titanium carbide, titanium diboride, zircon, and zirconium carbide. It should be understood that when ZrO₂ YO The ceramic alloys are also effective in producing tough composite bodies containing refractory fibers and or whiskers. In general, the fibers and or whiskers may comprise up to about 80 by volume of the product. Al₂O₃, silicon oxycarbide, mullite, spinel, silicon nitride, AlN, B₄C, BN, ZrO₂, zircon, and SiC are illustrative of useful fibers and whiskers. HfO₂ and HfO₂ ZrO₂ solid solutions can be partially stabilized with CaO, MgO, Y₂O₃, and rare earth oxides, although the tetragonal phase in these partially stablized materials, particularly in those materials with high HfO₂ levels, often transforms to the monoclinic phase at room temperature. Because of those factors, HfO₂ and HfO₂ ZrO₂ solid solutions can be toughened and partially stabilized with YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ and analogs thereof in like manner to ZrO₂ to yield alloys of high toughness which, in turn, may be incorporated into ceramic matrices and or bodies containing refractory fibers and or whiskers to further improve the toughness thereof. FIGURE 1 graphically depicts exemplary compositions studied in this investigation to distinguish regions where microcracking of the sintered bodies is a serious problem from those where whole and intact bodies are produced. A toughness value, expressed in terms of MPa FIGURE 2 depicts a polygon O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z O enclosing the inventive composition region operable in obtaining intact sintered bodies of high toughness. U.S. Patent No. 3,522,064 discusses the production of refractory bodies containing ZrO₂ stabilized with 5 20 by weight CaO Nb₂O₅, consisting of 3 10 CaO and 2 15 Nb₂O₅, by firing such compositions at 1700 2100 C those temperatures being much higher than the sintering temperatures employed in the present invention. The disclosure teaches that the ZrO₂ is stabilized in cubic crystal form. X ray diffraction analyses of the final products also identified the presence of about 10 20 by weight monoclinic ZrO₂ and the remainder cubic ZrO₂. In contrast, electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and x ray diffraction studies of the sintered products resulting from the present invention indicate the presence of a substantial amount of the tetragonal phase of ZrO₂ in most compositions. In addition, electron microscope examination of the inventive products has identified the presence of a niobate and or tantalate rich phase for most compositions, as well as a ZrO₂ rich component exhibiting a tetragonal crystal structure, those circumstances providing the microstructure necessary for the transformation toughening of the inventive products. U.S. Patent No. 4,266,979 discloses the fabrication of an oxygen sensor ceramic consisting of a solid electrolyte of a ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ material comprising aggregates of cubic ZrO₂ grains having an average size of 2 10 µm and monoclinic ZrO₂ grains having an average size of 0.2 1 µm the aggregates of cubic ZrO₂ being in contact with one another and the monoclinic ZrO₂ being distributed as aggregates in clearances among the aggregates of cubic ZrO₂. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,298,385 describes the production of sintered ceramic articles of high toughness. The articles consist of an isotropic matrix, e.g., Al₂O₃, and at least one phase of ceramic embedment material dispersed therein, e.g., ZrO₂, formed from a powder consisting of particles having an average size of 0.3 1.25 µm. In the preferred embodiment unstabilized ZrO₂ comprises the embedment material which leads to the development of microcracks in the article. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,316,964 is directed to the preparation of tough, strong Al₂O₃ ZrO₂ sintered ceramics by incorporating metastable grains of tetragonal ZrO₂ in their structure. The articles consist of 5 95 by volume tetragonal ZrO₂ grains having diameters 2 microns, a rare earth oxide selected from the group of Y₂O₃, CeO₂, Er₂O₃, and La₂O₃, and the remainder Al₂O₃. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,322,249 is concerned with manufacturing sintered or hot pressed ceramic articles which comprises dispersing throughout a matrix, e.g., Al₂O₃, SiC, or Si₃N₄, at least one ceramic embedment material, e.g., unstabilized ZrO₂ or HfO₂, the particles of the latter ranging about 0.1 5 microns. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,343,909 is drawn to ceramic compositions useful as inserts for cutting tools the composition consisting essentially, in weight percent, of 1 15 ZrO₂, 5 20 TiB₂, 60 90 Al₂O₃, 0 2 MgO, and 0 10 TiO₂. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,358,516 reveals the fabrication of solid electrolytes composed of β Al₂O₃, β Al₂O₃, and Na Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,366,254 details the manufacture of ceramic bodies suitable for cutting tools, which bodies consist of, by volume 4 20 ZrO₂, 60 90 Al₂O₃, and 3 30 of a refractory metal compound selected from the group of carbide, nitrides and carbonitrides of Group IVB and Group VB metals of the Periodic Table, and carbides of the Group VIB metals. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,396,724 cites ceramic bodies useful for cutting tools which consist of Al₂O₃, ZrO₂, and WC. Nb₂O₅ and Ta₂O₅ are nowhere mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,360,598 provides partially stabilized ZrO₂ ceramics consisting essentially of ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃ in a molar ratio Y₂O₃ ZrO₂ of about 2 98 7 93. The bodies consist of crystal grains having a mixed phase consisting essentially of tetragonal ZrO₂ and cubic ZrO₂, or having a phase consisting of tetragonal ZrO₂, the average size of the crystal grains being not larger than 2 µm. Whereas the patent notes the optional replacement of up to 30 mole of the Y₂O₃ with GaO, MgO, or rare earth oxides such as Yb₂O₃, Sc₂O₃, Nb₂O₃, and Sm₂O₃, the only working example provided of rare earth oxide replacement involved Yb₂O₃. Accordingly, there is no disclosure of the remarkable effect upon the toughness of the final product having compositions within the system defined in the present invention. U.S. Patent No. 4,507,394 cites zirconia and or hafnia containing ceramics exhibiting high electrical resistivity and mechanical strength which consists essentially of 5 30 mole of at least one component of Group A consisting of YO Nowhere in this patent is the toughness of any of the ceramics measured. Although the authors of the patent claim the ceramics described by the patent have high strength, the highest flexural strength measured for these materials was 47 Kg mm². U.S. Patent No. 4,360,598 mentioned previously describes ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ ceramics of mainly the tetragonal crystalline phase. The maximum flexural strength cited in this patent is 112 Kg mm², over a factor of two higher than the 47 Kg mm² strength cited in Patent No. 4,507,394. As Syunzo Mase is an inventor for both patents it is reasonable to assume that he was aware that the ceramics described in Patent No. 4,507,394 were dramatically inferior in strength to previous ceramics of related composition and crystal structure. The ceramics described in Patent No. 4,507,394 are thus not remarkable in any respect other than their high electrical resistivity. As such, the high toughness materials produced by the present invention are completely unexpected and not obvious to the worker in the art. Furthermore, the formation of high toughness alloys from the combination of ZrO₂ YO Inasmuch as YNbO₄ constitutes the preferred embodiment, the bulk of the following description will be directed to that material. Likewise, ZrO₂ or ZrO₂ partially stabilized by Y₂O₃ comprises the preferred ZrO₂ and or HfO₂ component. Two general methods were employed to produce finely divided, sinterable powders of desired compositions in the ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ YNbO₄ system. The first involved a coprecipitation technique, whereas the second method merely used a commercial ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ powder as the base material which was modified through additions of yttrium in the form of Y NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O and niobium in the form of Nb OH ₅ and Nb₂O₅. In the following laboratory work, the density of YNbO₄ was assumed to be equivalent to that of ZrO₂, such that volume percent YNbO₄ is equal to weight percent YNbO₄. NbCl₅ was dissolved in aqueous HCl to form a solution that could be filtered through a 0.3 1 µm filter. Inasmuch as the solution is exposed to air, the niobium may be in form of very finely dispersed hydroxides. A concentrated aqueous solution of zirconyl nitrate and Y NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O was added to the NbCl₅ HCl solution. High concentrations of niobium required additional HCl to prevent precipitation of niobium hydroxides and high concentrations of yttrium required additional water and a small amount of HNO₃ to maintain the yttrium salts in solution. Because of the large amount of heat generated during the following hydroxide precipitation reaction, the solution was divided into 100 ml portions. NH₄OH is added to the portions, a large excess being used to obtain a high supersaturation and the precipitation was carried out quickly to avoid segregation of the cations. The high supersaturation produces a high nucleation rate which provides very finely divided and intimately mixed hydroxide particles that form a gel. The precipitated gel was thereafter washed with an aqueous NH₄OH solution having a pH 10 at least three times, preferably by having the gel in a centrifuge container, shaking the container for several minutes, and then separating the gel from the wash water by centrifuging. The washing is necessary to remove NH₄Cl salts remaining in the gel. Water trapped in the gel was eliminated by filtering and subsequently freeze drying. The material was thereafter calcined at 1000 C for two hours and an isopropyl alcohol slurry of the calcine vibramilled for three days using zirconia beads. The slurry was passed through a screen to extract the beads therefrom and the powder dried. The powder was moistened slightly with isopropyl alcohol and 1.27 cms 0.5 diameter pills uniaxially pressed at low pressure, i.e., about 6,895 34,475 kPa 1000 5000 psi , and isostatically cold pressed to 310,275 kPa 45,000 psi . In a variation of that procedure, powder of the commercial ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ was dispersed into methanol and an appropriate amount of NbCl₅ dissolved in the slurry. After shaking the slurry vigorously, NH₄OH was admixed therein, the slurry again shaken vigorously, and the ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ plus the niobium hydroxide Nb OH ₅ precipitate centrifuged. The material was washed several times with methanol containing NH₄OH to maintain the pH at a high level, and the gel then separated from the wash liquid by centrifuging. The material was thereafter calcined at 700 C for two hours. An appropriate amount of Y NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O was dissolved in methanol and the calcined powder admixed into the methanol solution. The methanol was slowly evaporated at slightly elevated temperatures while the slurry was agitated occasionally. The resultant powder was again calcined at 700 C for two hours and the calcine pressed into pills in the manner described above. Of the compositions made by the dispersion of commercial ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ and precipitation of niobium hydroxide from niobium chloride that are listed in Tables I, II, and III, only Examples 11 and 16 were vibramilled for two days to improve compositional homogeneity. In this technique, ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 4 weight YNbO₄ was prepared from powdered ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ by simply admixing a calculated amount of powdered reagent grade Nb₂O₅ into a slurry composed of methanol and powdered ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃, and vibramilling for 2.5 days utilizing ZrO₂ beads. The beads were removed by passing the slurry through a screen, the methanol slowly evaporated from the slurry, and the resultant powder calcined for two hours at 700 C. Pills having a diameter of about 1.27 cms 0.5 were uniaxially pressed at about 6,895 34,475 kPa 1000 5000 psi and isostatically cold pressed at 310,275 kPa 45,000 psi from the calcines of the above technique. No dispersants or binders were used in the production of the pills. The pills prepared either via the coprecipitation method or the simple addition technique were sintered according to varying schedules. Some were fired in a vacuum furnace for two hours at temperatures from 1300 1600 C with an 800 C hour heating and cooling rate, after a presintering heat treatment at 1000 C for two hours in air with a heating and cooling rate of 100 C hour. Others were fired in air at 1400 C or 1450 C for two hours with a 100 C hour heating rate to 1000 C, a 50 C hour heating rate to 1400 C or 1450 C, and a 100 C hour cooling rate. One addition composition ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 4 weight YNbO₄ was scaled up to specimen sizes in the form of discs about 5.08 cms 2 in diameter and 0.95 cms 3 8 in thickness. Three 4.76 cms 1 7 8 diameter discs were pressed at low pressure, i.e., about 6,895 kPa 1000 psi, and isostatically cold pressed to 310,275 kPa 45,000 psi . One pressed disc was sintered in one of the following three schedules One disc of addition type ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 4 weight YNbO₄ having a diameter of about 5.08 cms 2 and a cross section of about 0.793 cms 5 16 was vacuum hot pressed for two hours at 1450 C at a pressure of 41,370 kPa 6000 psi in a graphite mold. The heating rate was about 700 C hour and the cooling rate about 500 C hour. Pressure was applied between 600 700 C during heating and released at about 500 C during cooling. Table I records several compositions prepared in the course of the above reported research. Examples 3 8 and 18 were derived via the coprecipitation process 9 16 were produced utilizing the commercial ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ with NbCl₅ and precipitating Nb OH ₅ with NH₄OH Example 17 involved adding Nb₂O₅ to commercial ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃. Table II reports the results of wet chemical analyses conducted on several Examples expressed in terms of weight percent on the oxide basis. The HfO₂ content represents an impurity in the ZrO₂ ingredient. Table III lists the temperatures at which the compositions of Table I were sintered for two hours, along with Vickers hardness measurements GPa made on the sintered samples and fracture toughness K The sintered specimens were ground and polished and microhardness testing undertaken utilizing 5, 10, 30, and 50 kilogram loads. In Table III all of the measurements were made employing a 10 kilogram load, except those samples marked with one asterisk where a 30 kilogram load was used, two asterisks where a 50 kilogram load was used, and YNbO₄ where a 5 kilogram load was used. All of the specimens sintered to closed porosity and, when examined by optical microscopy, appeared to have densities greater than about 97 of theoretical. Large areas in most samples appeared to have a density of 100 of theoretical, but frequently there were large pore clusters. Grain sizes ranged from less than 0.5 micron to over 2 µm. The microstructure of the samples prepared via the coprecipitating process and those prepared by precipitating the commercial ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ with NH₄OH, plus milling after calcination, appeared to be uniform in overall composition and grain size. A comparison of Examples 1 and 16 is of particular interest. As can be observed, the toughness of Example 1 ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ decreases as the indentation load increases. In contrast, the measured toughness of Example 16 ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 4 weight YNbO₄ remains essentially constant as the indentation load is increased. Such behavior is believed to underscore the finding that additions of YNbO₄ can substantially improve the toughness of ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ compositions. A comparison of Example 2 with Examples 3 5, 9, and 10 illustrates the significant enhancement in toughness which the inclusion of YNbO₄ will endow to the base ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ body. Examples 6 and 7 indicate, however, that additions of YNbO₄ must be held below 20 by weight to enjoy the improvement in toughness. Example 18 illustrates that at extremely low levels of Y₂O₃, even with additions of YNbO₄, the tetragonal phase can transform to the monoclinic phase upon cooling from the sintering temperature, thereby resulting in a microcracked body. Specimens of Examples 3, 7, and 8, sintered at 1400 C, 1460 C, or 1600 C for two hours, and of Examples 4 and 5, sintered at 1400 C and 1600 C for two hours, were polished etched in NH₄F HF, and then examined by scanning electron microscopy. A major crystal phase and a minor crystal phase were observed, the latter being more easily etched and of larger grain size than the major phase. The apparent area proportion of this second phase increases with increases in YNbO₄ and Y₂O₃ concentrations, and with increases in sintering temperature. Inasmuch as the ammonium bifluoride etches the cubic phase of ZrO₂, which phase is higher in stabilizer Y₂O₃ content, more rapidly than the tetragonal phase of ZrO₂, the latter phase containing a lower content of stabilizer, it is conjectured that this phase of larger grain size in the ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ YNbO₄ materials has a high concentration of Y₂O₃ and is cubic, while the finer grain size phase is tetragonal. Several conclusions can be drawn from the above laboratory data. First, whereas sintered bodies of ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃ may demonstrate fracture toughness values somewhat greater than 6MPa Table IV reports another group of compositions prepared in the course of the above discussed research the compositions involving the ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ system with and without additions of YNbO₄. Each sample was prepared employing the ammonium hydroxide precipitation procedure described above, utilizing commercially available powders of ZrO₂, ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃, ZrO₂ 2.5 mole Y₂O₃, ZrO₂ 3 mole Y₂O₃, or ZrO₂ 6 mole Y₂O₃ with the exception of Example 20. All of these precipitated formulations were vibramilled for two days. In Example 20 Nb₂O₅ was added to commercial ZrO₂ powder and vibramilled for two days. The ZrO₂ 2.5 mole Y₂O₃ of Example 21 is a commercial product. Pills having a diameter of about 1.27 cms 0.5 were pressed and sintered in the manner described above. Each sample was sintered for two hours in a vacuum at the temperatures recorded in Table V employing heating and cooling rates of 800 C hour. Vickers hardness measurements GPa and fracture toughness Values K Several conclusions can be drawn through an examination of the above data Second, whereas additions of YNbO₄ to ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ compositions wherein the Y₂O₃ content is not more than about 5 mole can improve the toughness thereof, at higher levels of Y₂O₃, i.e., about 7.5 mole Y₂O₃, such additions do not appear to impart any enhancement of toughness. That latter circumstance is believed to be due to the fact that the composition produces an essentially cubic structure, i.e., there is a lack of tetragonal ZrO₂ in the product. That situation is evidenced by Example 31 wherein 10 by weight YNbO₄ was added to ZrO₂ 7.5 mole Y₂O₃. Third, the addition of Nb₂O₅ alone to undoped ZrO₂ Example 20 yielded heavily microcracked bodies having essentially a monoclinic structure. Accordingly, additions of Nb₂O₅ alone to ZrO₂ do not provide enhanced toughness. FIGURE 1 illustrates the composition ranges where compositions examined in this work produced microcracked bodies or whole and intact bodies after sintering in the temperature ranges previously noted. FIGURE 1 illustrates the highest toughness measured for a particular composition. It can be seen that the highest toughness materials, greater than 8.5 MPa In view of the data presented in Tables I V and FIGURE 1, a minimum of YNbO₄ in an amount equivalent to the inclusion of 0.5 mole 1 percent by weight to ZrO₂ 2.2 to 9 mole YO Mase et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,507,394, describe zirconia, niobia tantala , and yttria rare earth oxide compositions that have high electrical resistivity. Four compositions that they examined are given in Table VI. I also examined these compositions according to the descriptions given in columns 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 of Patent No. 4,507,394. Note the prime designation is utilized to denote the Mase et al. compositions allowing easy comparison to Mase et al., Patent No. 4,507,394 , while differentiating the above four compositions from the majority of compositions examined in this work. The same commercial ZrO₂ powder with no Y₂O₃ additive that was used for the previous samples was also used here. Commercial Ta₂O₅, Nb₂O₅, Al₂O₃, Y NO₃ 3 6H₂O and Eu NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O were used. The ZrO₂, the Nb₂O₅ or Ta₂O₅, and the Y NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O or Eu NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O were mixed by a wet process and the mixture was thoroughly dried. The mixture was calcined at 800 C. For sample number 2 the Al₂O₃ sintering aid was then added. The four compositions were then subjected to dry pulverization with 0.5 by weight of polyethyleneglycol for 20 200 hours. The resuling powder was press molded and then fired at 1325 C in air for two hours. Other samples were press molded, prefired in air at 1000 C, and then fired in vacuum at 1325 C for two hours. The samples were examined by optical microscopy and the one composition that did not microcrack was polished and the fracture toughness measured by the same procedure used for the previous samples of Table I V. Table VII reports the results. Table VII illustrates that only one of these four compositions examined by Mase et al. did not microcrack when made to their description. The microcracking of compositions 1 , 2 , and 22 is consistent with the microcracking of compositions containing little or no excess yttria 0 to 0.5 mole YO A comparison of all the compositions examined by Mase et al. with the data of Table I VII indicates that, with the exception of composition 3 , the materials should have extremely low toughnesses, below about 5 MPa To investigate the utility of compounds other than YNbO₄ for enhancing the toughness of zirconia containing bodies, the several compositions in volume percent and molar percent recited in Table VIII were formulated. The compositions involved the partial or total substitution of yttrium with an element demonstrating the valence of yttrium and the partial or total substitution of niobium with an element demonstrating the valence of niobium. The resulting compounds exhibited a structure and refractoriness similar to YNbO₄. For the purpose of these experiments, the molar volumes of these rare earth niobates and or tantalates were assumed to be equivalent to twice the molar volume of ZrO₂. Hence, for example, 5 by volume LaNbO₄ in ZrO₂ equals 2.5 mole LaNbO₄ in ZrO₂. Each sample was prepared employing the ammonium hydroxide precipitation technique outlined above. Pill specimens having a diameter of about 0.5 were pressed and sintered also in the manner described above. Each sample was sintered for two hours at the temperatures recorded in Table VIII. Vickers hardness measurements GPa and fracture toughness values K As is evident from a study of Table VIII, various rare earth elements can be substituted for yttrium, and tantalum can replace niobium with no deleterious effect upon the capability of improving the toughness of yttrium doped zirconia containing bodies. Accordingly, whereas YNbO₄ constitutes the most preferred toughening agent, YTaO₄ and mixtures of YNbO₄ and YTaO₄ are operable, as are rare earth niobates MNbO₄ , rare earth tantalates MTaO₄ , and mixtures of YNbO₄ and or YTaO₄ with MNbO₄ and or MTaO₄. Additionally, Example 54 illustrates that rare earth oxides can fully replace yttria in both the YNbO₄ and as the partial stabilization dopant in the zirconia. As the exact distribution of cations between the possible phases in these alloys is not known, the Examples 51, 52, and 53 prove that over one third of the total amount of yttria can be replaced by La₂O₃, Nd₂O₃ or YbGdO₃. It is reasonable to assume that various rare earth oxides including CeO₂, Pr₂O₃, La₂O₃ and Nd₂O₃ as well as mixtures of rare earth oxides can fully replace yttria in these compositions. Because of the inherent high toughness values exhibited by the above ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ YNbO₄ ceramic alloys, their utility as toughening agents in various highly refractory ceramic matrices was investigated. A rapid, cursory survey of a wide variety of ceramic matrices was undertaken to determine their general efficacy. In preparation for the study, powders of the following three compositions of ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ YNbO₄ were made utilizing the variation of the coprecipitation procedure outlined above involving precipitation with NH₄OH viz., ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 8 weight YNbO₄, ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 10 weight YNbO₄, and ZrO₂ 1 mole Y₂O₃ 12 weight YNbO₄. Another powder sample of a ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ YNbO₄ composition, viz., ZrO₂ 2 mole Y₂O₃ 4 weight YNbO₄, was prepared utilizing the oxide addition method described above. As will be explained in detail below, those powders were combined with an alumina powder, a magnesium rich spinel powder, an aluminum rich spinel powder, a zircon powder, a titanium diboride powder, a zirconium carbide powder, mullite powder, silicon carbide powder, and silicon carbide whiskers. The resulting powder mixtures, as well as samples of the matrix materials only, were vibramilled for 24 hours in isopropyl alcohol using relatively large ZrO₂ milling media. Pills having a diameter of about 1.27cms 0.5 were uniaxially pressed at about 6,895 34,475 kPa 1000 5000 psi from the oxide powders and the pills isostatically cold pressed at 310,275 kPa 45,000 psi . Thereafter, the pills were pre fired in air to 1000 C for two hours and then sintered for two hours at selected temperatures between 1450 1650 C in a vacuum furnace. Both the heating rate and the cooling rate for the sintering studies were 800 C hour. Powders of the carbide, boride, and oxides were hot pressed for two hours at 1450 C or 1650 C at a pressure of 27,580 kPa 4000 psi in an induction heated hot press using graphite molds under vacuum to produce discs having a diameter of about 3.81 cms 1.5 and a cross section of about 0.793 cms 5 16 . The sintered and hot pressed samples were ground and polished to a one µm diamond finish, and those samples examined by optical microscopy. Microhardness testing was performed on the polished discs utilizing a 10 kg load. The elastic modulus of zirconia yttrium niobate was assumed to be 200 GPa the elastic modulus of alumina was assumed to be 380 GPa the elastic modulus of spinel was assumed to be 260 GPa the elastic modulus of zircon was assumed to be 200 GPa the elastic modulus of titanium diboride was assumed to be 515 GPa the elastic modulus of zirconium carbide was assumed to be 410 GPa the elastic modulus of mullite was assumed to be 200 GPa and the modulus of silicon carbide powder and silicon carbide whiskers was assumed to be 450 GPa. For compositions involving combinations of the various oxides and non oxides, the elastic modulus of the alloy was assumed to be a simple linear combination by volume of the elastic moduli of the components. Fracture toughness was calculated from the equation recited above. Several samples of the sintered alumina zirconia yttrium niobate compositions were examined by x ray diffraction. The x ray diffraction scans were limited to the region of 20 ranging from 26 36 using Cu radiation. The amount of tetragonal zirconia yttrium niobate phase s and the amount of monoclinic zirconia yttrium niobate phase s were assessed qualitatively from the relative peak heights of the phases in that region of 20. In the case of the zirconia yttrium niobate silicon carbide whisker composite, the whiskers and the zirconia yttrium niobate powder were first vibramilled for 24 hours in distilled water. In preparing the two ZrO₂ YNbO₄ glass SiC whisker composites, a glass powder consisting, in weight percent, of about 33.3 Al₂O₃, 33.3 SiO₂, and 33.3 Y₂O₃ was produced by milling Al₂O₃ and SiO₂ together preparing a slurry in distilled water of that glass powder plus Y NO₃ ₃ 6H₂O drying the water and calcining the material remaining at 500 C. Thereafter, the glass powder, the silicon carbide whiskers, and zirconia yttrium niobate powder were vibramilled for 48 hours in distilled water utilizing zirconia milling media. The resultant powders for all three composites were dried, granulated, and vacuum hot pressed for two hours at 1450 C at 4000 psi in graphite molds. The elastic modulus of the added glass was assumed to be 69 GPa. In addition to the powder combinations of alumina and zirconia yttrium niobate referred to above, two Al₂O₃ ZrO₂ Y₂O₃ YNbO₄ compositions were coprecipitated and sintered in the manner described above with respect to other coprecipitated specimens. Two compositions are reported below as Examples A and B. Portions of the powders of those two compositions were modified by adding Nb₂O₅ and Y₂O₃ utilizing a variation of the coprecipitation technique involving precipitation with NH₄OH . Those two compositions are recorded below as Examples C and D. Three powder combinations of alumina and zirconia yttrium niobate are tabulated below as Examples E, F, and G, as is a specimen of alumina alone, Example H. Table IX recites the composition of each sample in volume percent and the temperatures at which the samples were sintered, along with Vickers hardness measurements GPa and fracture toughness values K The Al₂O₃ specimen sintered at 1450 C was highly porous and that sintered at 1500 C exhibited considerable porosity. However, the addition of as little as 25 by volume zirconia yttrium niobate allowed the ceramic alloys to achieve full density when fired it 1450 C. Moreover, the grain size of the alloy was considerably smaller than that observed in the Al₂O₃ sample. Hence, the inclusion of ZrO₂ YNbO₄ assists sintering, and grain growth is impeded through the addition of the second phase. As is evident from Table IX, the toughness of all the samples containing zirconia yttrium niobate was greater than that of the Al₂O₃ specimen, whereas the reverse was true with respect to hardness. The toughness of the samples containing 75 by volume zirconia yttrium niobate fell dramatically when the composition was sintered at 1600 and 1650 C. The hardness value also fell substantially at those two sintering temperatures. Scanning electron micrographs have indicated that the coprecipitated compositions have a somewhat more uniform spatial distribution of the alumina and zirconia yttrium niobate phases than the mixed materials. The grain sizes of the coprecipitated materials also appeared to be slightly smaller for a given sintering temperature. Finally, it appeared that there may be more intragranular grains of zirconia yttrium niobate trapped within the Al₂O₃ grains in the coprecipitated samples. Wet chemical analyses were conducted on the two coprecipitated specimens and those results, in weight percent, are listed in Table X. The HfO₂ is an impurity in the ZrO₂ material. The specimens of Example C that were sintered at temperatures higher than 1450 C were subject to indentation impressions from the hardness testing and were heavily microcracked, such that no reliable hardness or toughness values could be obtained. X ray diffraction analyses of the several samples indicated the presence of two basic regimes of microstructures of high toughness with regard to the content of tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO₂ with YNbO₄ viz., bodies containing greater than 50 by volume Al₂O₃ and those containing less than 50 by volume Al₂O₃. To illustrate, Example G 75 by volume zirconia yttrium niobate displayed a diffraction pattern quite similar to that of zirconia yttrium niobate alone with, of course, the inclusion of Al₂O₃ peaks . Samples that manifested high toughness evidenced very little or no monoclinic phase. Samples of lower toughness still contained the tetragonal phase as the predominant portion, but a substantial amount of the monoclinic phase was present. In contrast, samples containing about 50 by volume or less of zirconia yttrium niobate did not display the highest toughness when the diffraction pattern indicated the presence of the tetragonal phase only. The toughest samples contained about 20 50 by volume of the total amount of the zirconia yttrium niobate in the sample in the monoclinic state. When the majority of the zirconia yttrium was in the monoclinic phase, the specimens exhibited microcracking and low toughness. Table XI reports compositions of further powder combinations involving alumina illustrating effects upon hardness and toughness. The compositions are tabulated in terms of volume along with the temperature at which each specimen was sintered, Vickers hardness measurements GPa , and fracture toughness values K Examination of Tables IX and XI permits a number of conclusions First, the additions of yttrium niobate can improve the toughness of 50 to 75 volume percent zirconia partially stabilized with 2 mole percent yttria with 50 to 25 volume percent alumina at some sintering temperatures. Compare the pairs of samples G O and F M. Second, some addition of yttrium niobate increased the toughness of compositions with 15 or 25 volume percent of zirconia or zirconia yttria phases. At the 15 and 25 volume percent level for zirconia yttria yttrium niobate phase or phases, additions of small amounts of yttrium niobate increase toughness but larger amounts decrease toughness Example I vs. Examples R, S and T Example J vs. U, V and W and Example K vs. Examples X, Y and Z. Third, Examples P and Q prove that additions of niobia alone to alumina zirconia ceramic alloys do not result in whole unmicrocracked bodies. Fourth, additions of zirconia without yttria or yttrium niobate to alumina at the 15 and 25 volume percent levels toughen alumina, Examples I and J, while at the 50 and 75 volume percent levels the materials microcrack heavily, Examples L and N. When zirconia with two mole percent yttria is added to alumina at the 50 to 75 volume percent levels the materials are not microcracked and are toughened, Examples M and O. These data illustrate that for the zirconia yttria alumina system, adjustments of the minor component, yttria, exert a decisive effect on the mechanical integrity and toughness of the body. The data in Table IX and XI prove that, in a manner similar to the case of the zirconia yttria alumina system described above, adjustments of the compositions with yttrium niobate also have a decisive effect upon toughness in particular, small amounts of yttrium niobate increase the toughness while larger amounts of YNbO₄ appear to help stabilize the tetragonal phase to prevent transformation to the monoclinic phase and thus lower toughness. This effect is not obvious and would be unexpected even to the worker of more than ordinary skill in the art. The magnesia rich spinel consisted essentially, in weight percent, of 28.9 MgO, 71.1 Al₂O₃, and the alumina rich spinel consisted essentially, in weight percent, of 26.65 MgO, 73.35 Al₂O₃. Toughness K The spinel alone did not sinter to a high density at temperatures of 1450 and 1500 C, whereas the alloy specimens were highly dense after firing at those temperatures. All of the samples containing zirconia yttrium niobate were heavily microcracked after sintering at 1650 C. The hardness of the alloy samples was somewhat greater than that of the spinel alone, and the toughness of the alloy samples was about twice that of the spinel at 50 and higher volume fractions of zirconia yttrium niobate. The spinel alone could not be sintered to high density at 1450 C, whereas the ceramic alloys evidenced good density when fired at that temperature. The hardness of the alloy samples was, perhaps, slightly higher than that of the spinel alone and exhibited the same trend of decreasing with higher firing temperatures. The toughness of the alloy samples was marginally higher than that of the spinel alone at low levels of zirconia yttrium niobate additions, but rose sharply with additions greater than 50 percent by volume. Optical microscopy indicated that the grain size of the sintered spinel zirconia yttrium niobate alloy is substantially smaller than that present in the sintered spinel specimens. The same observation was made with respect to the alumina zirconia yttrium niobate alloys. Samples of powdered zircon alone did not sinter to high density at 1450 and 1500 C. Because the zircon powder employed in this study was coarser than the alumina and spinel powders used above, the particles thereof agglomerated sufficiently to prevent specimens containing 25 volume percent of zirconia yttrium niobate from reaching full density when sintered at 1450 C. At higher temperatures the samples of zircon alone began to dissociate in the reduced pressure of the vacuum furnace. Hence, the zircon specimens fired at 1600 and 1650 C evidenced areas, especially near the surface of the samples, that were more porous than the zircon body sintered at 1550 C. Those porous regions contained large amounts of second phases, e.g., ZrO₂ and a grain boundary silicate phase. Other areas in the interior of the samples were not as porous and appeared to contain less ZrO₂ and silicate phases. The alloy specimens were not as porous when sintered at higher temperatures. It is believed that the presence of the zirconia yttrium niobate suppressed dissociation of the zircon. Toughness K The alloy specimens were, perhaps, slightly harder than Zircon alone and were unquestionably considerably tougher. A sample of zirconium carbide alone and three samples of differing levels of zirconium carbide zirconia yttrium niobate ceramic alloy were hot pressed to high density at 1450 C. Toughness K It is apparent from Table XV that the ceramic alloys are somewhat harder and stronger than the zirconium carbide alone. Table XVI records the composition of each sample in volume and the temperatures at which the specimens were sintered, along with Vickers hardness measurements GPa and fracture toughness values K The above data illustrate that the toughness of mullite bodies can be improved significantly through additions of zirconia yttrium niobate, and that zirconia yttrium niobate can assist the sintering of mullite bodies. Table XVII presents the composition of each sample in volume and the temperature at which the samples were hot pressed, along with Vickers hardness measurements GPa and fracture toughness values K SiC cannot be hot pressed to bodies of full density at the temperatures and pressures that yielded dense composites of SiC zirconia yttrium niobate. The technical literature has reported toughness values for commercial SiC ranging between about 2 4 MPa One sample consisting solely of SiC whiskers and zirconia yttrium niobate and two samples comprising SiC whiskers, zirconia yttrium niobate, and 15 by volume of the glass described above were hot pressed at 1450 C. The glass was incorporated to ease fabrication of a dense body. Vickers hardness GPa and toughness K Table XIX reports Vickers hardness GPa and K Whereas the above description has been drawn to shaped bodies produced through such means as hot pressing and sintering, it will be recognized that the term bodies includes such variants as beads, coatings, fibers, honeycombs, and sheets fabricated utilizing the wide variety of methods known to the art, including, but not limited to, arc melting, chemical vapor depositions, extrusion, plasma spraying, skull melting, and zone melting. For example, the hardness and toughness exhibited by the inventive materials strongly recommend their utility as abrasion resistant and thermal barrier coatings. Based upon the above exemplary embodiments, the polygon O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z O presented in FIGURE 2 was devised which encompasses compositions operable in the instant invention. That polygon was drawn founded in the following parameters where YO
