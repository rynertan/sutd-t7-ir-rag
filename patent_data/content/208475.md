# NETWORK

## Abstract
A technique for regulating the transmission of messages initiated simultaneously by a plurality of nodes of a network, in which clock intervals are established for the network, a sequence of digital values is included in each message and is transmitted to the medium at the rate of one digital value per clock interval, the sequences included in messages that are initiated at the same time by more than one node are transmit ted in the same sequence of clock intervals, the presence on the medium of a selected digital value during any clock in terval in which a node is transmitting a different digital value within the sequence of a message is detected, and the trans mission of the message is interrupted by the node upon such detection, without corrupting another node s transmission.
