# Radar simulator.

## Abstract
A beam width integrator is provided for a radar simula tion system in which a synthetic radar image is generated from echoes comprised of simulated echo contributions. The amount of special purpose digital equipment required is sig nificantly reduced, together with the overall cost and com plexity of the equipment. Data signals 52 which jointly rep resent an echo contribution are provided in logarithmic form in order to limit the required storage and other logic and to reduce the number of operations required to process the signals. The echo contributions are divided into successive groups O K each group comprising a predetermined number of echo contributions lumped to constitute a single set of equivalent signals. A complete echo is represented in uncorrected form by a predetermined number of successive groups. By numeric adders 72 , an average weighting signal WS is applied to each group of lumped echo contributions to correct for gain profile originated echo intensity variations. The corrected signals are successively paired in an adder tree 74 comprising a plurality of power adders, each performing a numeric addition of a pair of logarithmic input signals. The output 105 of the adder tree comprises a plurality of beam width integrated data signals which are jointly representative of a true echo.
