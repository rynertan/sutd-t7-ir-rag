# Semiconductor device manufacture using molecular beam epitaxy with source temperature control.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which method a plurality of epitaxial layers are deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. A significant problem in such a method is the variation in the flux emitted by an effusion cell after the shutter associated with that cell has been opened, this resulting in undesired variations in the composition in the thickness direction of the epitaxial layer being grown. In a method according to the invention, when the shutter of a molecular beam source is opened, the rate of input of heat to that source is increased by a predetermined value so that the temperature of that source does not change substantially as result of the opening of that shutter, and when the shutter is closed the rate of input of heat to that source is reduced by the predetermined value.
