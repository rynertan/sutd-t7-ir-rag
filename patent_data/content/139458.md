More particularly, the process of producing the CL 1957A antibiotic compound relates to an aerobic fermentation process using a purified isolate of an actinomycete, identified as isolate ATCC 39366. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a purified isolate of an actinomycete having the identifying characteristics of ATCC 39366 which is capable of producing the antibiotic compound CL 1957A. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for producing CL,1957A by cultivating the isolate of actinomycete identified asATCC 39366 under aerobic conditions in a medium cdntaining assimilable sources of carbon and nitrogen until a substantial quantity of CL 1957A is produced, and subsequently isolating the CL 1957A compound. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there are provided the antibiotic compound CL 1957A and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which compounds exhibit antibiotic and anti tumor properties. In another aspect of the present invention, there are provided pharmaceutical compositions comprising the CL 1957A compound, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and, optionally, additional antibiotic and or antitumor compounds together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound of the present invention is useful in a method of treating microbial infections in a mamnal which method comprises administering an effective amount of the compound C1 i957A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound of the present invention is also useful in a method of treating tumours in matrrnals which method comprises administering an effective amount of the compound CL 1957A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with apharmaceutically acceptable carrier.FIGURES la, lb, lc, and ld are the ultraviolet, infrared, 360 MHz proton magnetic resonance, and 90.5 MHz 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, respectively, of the compound designated CL 1957A. In accordance with the present invention, the CL,1957A antibiotic compound is produced by cultivating a selected isolate of actinomycete, isolate ATCC 39366, under artificial conditions until a substantial quantity of CG1957A is formed, and subsequently isolating the compound. The strain of actinomycete suitable for the purpose of this invention was found in a soil sample collected in Pennsylvania, USA. This microorganism was isolated from the soil sample using a suitable agar plating medium, one containing salts such as potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and ferrous sulfate, and carbon sources such as glycerol and asparagine. The strain of microorganism was plated onto the agar medium and, once plated, was incubated at a favorable temperature, particularly 450C, to allow for the development of the soil microorganisms. The e CL 1957A producing organism that was isolated from the soil sample by the agar plating technique is an unidentified isolate of actinomycete and has been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection,Rockville, Maryland 20852, where it is being maintained in their permanent culture collection asATCC 39366. This organism, which produces CL 1957A, is also being maintained as a dormant culture in lyophile tubes, cryogenic vials, and in soil tubes in the Warner Lambert Parke Davis Culture Collection, 2800 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, where it is designated as culture wP 2053. The compound CL,1957A, which demonstrates both antibiotic and antitumor properties, is produced by isolate ATCC 39366 during aerobic fermentation under controlled conditions. The fermentation medium consists of sources of carbon, nitrogen, minerals, and growth factors. Examples of carbon sources are glycerol and various simple sugars, such as glucose, mannose, fructose, xylose, ribose, or other carbohydrate containing compounds such as dextrin, starch, cornmeal, and whey. The e normal quantity of carbon source materials in the fermentation medium varies from about 0.1 to about 10 weight percent. Nitrogen sources in the fermentation medium are organic, inorganic, or mixed organic inorganic material. Examples of such materials are cottonseed meal, soybean meal, corn germ flour, corn steep liquor, distillers dried solubles, peanut meal, peptonized milk, and various ammonium salts. The addition of minerals and growth factors are also helpful in the production of the CL 1957A compound. Examples of fermentation medium mineral additives include potassium chloride, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, calcium carbonate, cobalt chloride, and zinc sulfate. Sources of growth factors include various yeast and milk products. The preferred method for producing the CL 1957A compound is by submerged culture fermentation.According to this embodiment of the invention, the fermentation ingredients are prepared in solution or suspension and the mixture subsequently sterilized by autoclaving or steam heating. The pH of the aqueous medium is adjusted to preferably between about pH 4 and about pH 8 and the mixture cooled following sterilization to a temperature between about 160C to about 450C. The cooled, sterile fermentation medium is inoculated with the organism and thereafter fermentation is carried out with aeration and agitation. In the submerged culture method, fermentation is carried out in shake flasks or in stationary tank fermentors. In shake flasks, aeration is achieved by agitation of the flasks to bring about mixing of the medium with air. Zn stationary tank fermentors, agitation is provided by impellers which may take the form of disc turbines, vaned discs, open turbine or marine propellers. Aeration is accomplished by injecting air or oxygen into the agitated mixture. Adequate production of the CL 1957A compound is normally achieved under these conditions after a period of about two to ten days. In an alternative embodiment, the CL 1957A compound may also be produced by solid state fermentation of the microorganism.CHARACTERISTICS OF ATCC 39366Culture characterization studies were carried out on the microorganism designated ATCC 39366 CL 1957 producer and the results were compared to the published data on Streptomyces sp 81 484 kazugamycin producer and Streptomyces ATS 1287 leptomycin producer .

Example 7 A l ml portion of a cryogenically preserved culture of isolate ATCC 39366 was used to inoculate 600 ml of SD 05 seed medium contained in a 2 liter baffled shake flask. The inoculated shake flask contents were incubated for 71 hours at 240C with shaking 130 rpm gyratory shaking, 5 cm throw . The microbial growth from the 2 liter flask was used to inoculate 16 liters of SD 05 seed medium contained in a 30 liter stirred jar fermentor. The inoculated fermentor contents were incubated at 240C for 24 hours while being stirred at 300 rpm and sparged with air at a rate of 1 vol vol min. A 200 gallon 757 liter fermentor containing 160 gallons 606 liters of PM 10 production medium was sterilized by heating with steam for 40 minutes at 1210C. The fermentor and its contents were cooled to 240C and inoculated with about 15 liters of the microbial growth from the 30 liter stirred jar fermentor. The inoculated production medium was incubated at 240 C for five days with stirring at 155 rpm while being sparged with air at a rate of 0.75 vol vol min. Dow Corning wCw antifoam agent was added as needed to control foaming of the fermentation medium. The e production of the CL 1957A compound was monitored throughout the fermentation cycle using theL1210 mouse leukemia cell assay, by measuring the antimicrobial activity of the fermentation beer against Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, and by such fermentation parameters as pH and percent sedimentation.

Celite 545 11.4 kg was added and the mixture filtered through a 46 cm plate and frame filter press. The filtrate was allowed to stand to let the lower aqueous phase separate from the ethyl acetate extract. The e filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate 132 liters and the wash, after dilution with 76 liters of fresh ethyl acetate, was used to extract the separated aqueous layer from above. After allowing the mixture to settle,.the aqueous and organic layers from the second extract were separated and the aqueous layer extracted a third time with fresh ethyl acetate 189 liters .The three organic layers were combined and washed with deionized water 95 liters . The mixture was allowed to settle and the water wash separated. The e upper ethyl acetate layer 529 liters was concentrated in vacuo to 31 liters and then concentrated further with the displacement of ethyl acetate by methanol to yield 4.5 liters of a methanolic concentrate. This concentrate, diluted with one tenth volume of water, was extracted two times with four liter portions of petroleum ether bp 300 600C and then concentrated to approximately 500 ml. Continued concentration with displacement of methanol by water yielded approximately 400 ml of an aqueous suspension which was extracted three times with 400 ml portions of ethyl acetate.The ethyl acetate extracts were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated to a small volume, and then mixed with 250 grams of a mixture of silicic acid and Celite 545 1 1 . me e resulting slurry was evaporated in vacuo to a dry solid which was slurried with dichloromethane 300 ml , and added to the top of a column containing 4 kg of a mixture of silicic acid and Celite 545 1 1 packed in dichloromethane.The column was washed with dichloromethane 16 liters and then eluted with dichloromethane methanol 99 1, 14 liters , dichloromethane methanol 98 2, 20 liters and dichloromethane methanol 96 4, 20.5 liters . The fractions eluting with dichloromethane methanol 99 1 and dichloromethane methanol 98 2 were combined and concentrated in vacuo to a viscous oil containing crude CL 1957A. Purification of CL 1957 A EXAMPLE 9 The crude CL 1957A fraction from above was triturated two times with 750 ml portions of n heptane. The heptane insoluble material was dissolved in methanol 250 ml and the resulting methanolic solution filtered and concentrated to dryness in vacuo to afford 22 g of a solid residue containing CL 1957A. The solid was redissolved in methanol 20 ml and chromatographed over two liters of Sephadex LS 20 packed in methanol. After the appearance of color in the effluent, one 100 ml fraction and five 200 ml fractions were collected.Fractions five and six, which contained most of theCL 1957A based upon HPLC assay , were combined and concentrated to dryness to afford 13.6 g of crudeCL 1957A. This material was then further purified by chromatography over 1.9 kg of C18 silica gel Sepralyte C 18, 40 tim particle size, AnalytichemInternational, Harbor City, California contained in a stainless steel column 7 cm i.d. X 85 cm , using methanol water 80 20 as the eluent. A total of eighteen 500 ml fractions and seven one liter fractions were collected. Fractions nine through seventeen contained all of the CL 1957A by HPLC assay , and were combined according to the estimated purity of CL 1957A present in the individual fractions.Thus, fractions nine through twelve, thirteen through fifteen, and sixteen through seventeen yielded 5.75 g, 12.5 9, and 0.7 g of solids, respectively. Each lot of solids was subsequently chromatographed over separate columns containing silica gel 60 40 60 pm, E. Merck Reagents deactivated by the addition of 1t water. After sample application, each column was washed with dichloromethane methanol 98 2 and eluted with dichloromethane methanol 95 5 . For example, the 12.5 g product from Clg silica gel fractions thirteen through fifteen was chromatographed over 200 g of deactivated silica gel contained in a 2.5 cm li.d. X 85 cm glass column.After five i50 ml fractions of dichloromethane methanol 98 2 were collected, the column was eluted with dichloromethane methanol 95 5 collected in three 150 ml fractions, eight 50 ml fractions, and one 150 ml fraction. Fractions eight through twelve of the 5 methanol eluates, contained most of the CL 1957A based upon HPLC and TLC assay and were combined and concentrated to dryness to yield 1.03 g of purified CL 1957A as a pale yellow solid foam. Similar silica gel chromatographic purification of C18 silica gel fractions nine through twelve and sixteen through seventeen afforded 1.6 g and 0.4 g of purified CL 1957A, respectively.

Examples of suitable inorganic bases are ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also formed with amine cations derived from organic nitrogenous bases strong enough to form cations. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the acid are prepared, for example, by suspending the acid in water and adjusting the pR with the pharmaceutically acceptable base, or by reacting the compounds with one equivalent of the pharmaceutically acceptable base in a solvent and removing the solvent under reduced pressure. The e term, pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation contemplates the positively charged ions derived from such metals as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, zinc, iron, and the like. The salts are prepared by contacting the free acid form of the compound with an equivalent amount of the desired base in the conventional manner. The free forms may be regenerated by treating the salt form with an acid.For example, dilute aqueous acid solutions may be utilized to regenerate the free acid form from a respective salt. Dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid is suitable for this purpose. The free acid form differs from its respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to the respective free acid form for purposes of the invention. The term pharmaceutically acceptable amine cation contemplates the positively charged ammonium ion and analogous ions derived from organic nitrogenous bases strong enough to form such cations. Bases useful for the purpose of forming pharmacologically acceptable nontoxic addition salts of such compounds containing free carboxyl groups form a class whose limits are readily understood by those skilled in the art.Merely for illustration, they can be said to comprise, in cationic form, those of the formula EMI31.1 wherein Rat Rbt and Rcr independently, are hydrogen, alkyl of from about one to about six carbon atoms, cycloalkyl of from about three to about six carbon atoms, aryl of about six carbon atoms, aralkyl of from about 7 to about 11 carbon atoms, hydroxyalkyl of from about 2 to about 4 carbon atoms, or monoarylhydroxyalkyl of from about 8 to about 15 carbon atoms, or, when taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, any two of Ra, Rb, and Rc may form part of a 5 to 6 membered heterocyclic ring containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen, said heterocyclic rings and said aryl groups being unsubstituted or mono or dialkyl substituted said alkyl groups containing from about one to about six carbon atoms. Illustrative therefore of Ra, Rb, and Rc groups comprising pharmaceutically acceptable cations derived from ammonia or a basic amine are ammonium, mono , di , and trimethylammonium, mono, di and triethylammonium, mono , di , and tripropylammonium iso and normal , ethyldimethylamminoum, benzyldimethylammonium, cyclohexylammonium, benzylammonium, dibenzylammonium, piperidinium, morpholinium, pyrrolidinium, piperazinium, pyr id in ium, l methylpiperidinium, 4 ethylmorpholinium, l isopropylpyrrolidinium, 1, 4 dimethylpiperazinium, l n butylpiperidinium, 2 methylpiperidinium, l ethyl 2 methylpiperidinium, mono , di , and triethanolammonium, ethyldiethanolammonium, n butylmonoethanolammonium, tris hydroxymethyl methylammonium, phenylmonoethanolammonium, and the like. EXAMPLE 15Preparation of the Sodium Salt of CL 1957A Cooled sodium hydroxide solution 10 mg, 0.0176 M was added dropwise to a cooled solution of 100 mg 0.176 mmol of CL 1957A in 2.5 ml of methanol. During the addition, a white precipitate formed which redissolved by the end of the addition of base solution. The resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo and diluted to 40 ml with water. Two milliliter aliquots of this solution were added to each of several 6 ml vials.Lyophilization of the contents of each vial afforded a white solid corresponding, in each vial, to S mg of CL,1957A sodium salt. EXAMPLE 16Preparation of the Calcium Salt of CL 1957A Cooled calcium hydroxide solution 10 ml, 0.0088 M was added dropwise to a cooled solution of 100 mg 0.176 mmol of CL,1957A in 2.5 ml of methanol.After addition of the base solution, a white suspension formed, and some material coagulated on the walls of the solution container. The methanol was removed by evaporation, and sufficient l,l dimethylethanol was added to dissolve the water insoluble calcium salt of CL,1957A. The e resulting solution was lyophilized to yield the solid calcium salt, which was found to be insoluble in water, but soluble in ethanol. EXAMPLE 17Preparation of the Potassium Salt of CL 1957A Cooled potassium hydroxide solution 10 ml, 0.0176 M was added dropwise with stirring to a cooled solution of 100 mg 0.176 mmol of CL 1957A in 2.5 ml of methanol. The e resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo and then diluted with 40 ml of water.Two milliliter aliquots of this solution were added to each of several 6 ml vials. Lyophilization of the contents of each vial afforded a white solid corresponding, in each vial, to 5 mg of CL 1957A potassium salt. EXAMPLE 18Preparation of the Triethylammonium Salt of CL 1957A A cooled solution of triethylamine 2.45 ml, 0.176 mmol in 7.55 ml of water was added dropwise with stirring to a solution of 100 mg 0.176 mmol of CG1957A in 2.5 ml of methanol. The e resulting solution was concentrated to a final volume of about 2 ml on a rotary evaporator and then diluted to 40 ml with water. Two milliliter aliquots of this solution were added to each of several 6 ml vials. Lyophilization of the contents of each vial afforded a white solid corresponding, in each vial, to 5 mg of CL 1957A triethylammonium salt, which was found to be soluble in water. EXAMPLE 19Preparation of the Sodium Salt of CL 1957A with Hannibal Cooled sodium hydroxide solution 10 ml, 0.0176 M was added dropwise to a cooled solution of 100 mg 0.176 mmol of CL 1957A in 2.5 ml of methanol. The resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo to remove the methanol, and then 500 mg of mannitol contained in 10 ml of water was added to the concentrate. This mixture was diluted to 40 ml with water. Two milliliter aliquots of this solution were added to each of several 6 ml vials.Lyophilization of the contents of each vial afforded a white solid corresponding, in each vial, to 5 mg of CL 1957A sodium salt with mannitol as a bulking agent. EXAMPLE 20Preparation of the Sodium Salt of CL 1957A withAscorbic Acid and Mannitol Cooled sodium hydroxide solution 10 ml, 0.0176 M was added dropwise to a cooled solution of 100 mg 0.176 mmol of CL 1957A in 2.5 ml of methanol. The resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo to remove the methanol, and then 500 mg of mannitol and 73.3 mg of ascorbic acid, both contained in 10 ml of water, were added to the concentrate. The resulting mixture was diluted to 40 ml with water. Two milliliter aliquots of this solution were added to each of the several 6 ml vials.Lyophilization of the contents of each vial afforded a white solid corresponding, in each vial, to 5 mg of CL 1957A sodium salt and 2.48 mg of ascorbic acid, with mannitol as a bulking agent EXAMPLE 21Preparation of the N Methyl D Glucamine Salt ofCL 1957A A 5 ml solution of 11 mg N methyl D glucamine in water was added dropwise with stirring to 32 mg of CL 1957A in 2 ml methanol, cooled in an ice bath.The solution was concentrated in vacuo to remove methanol and diluted to 10 ml for lyophilization.The lyophilized solid is white and powdery. TheN methyl D glucamine salt is soluble in water. The antibiotic compound CL 1957A, either in its free acid form, or in the form of one or more of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are useful for their antimicrobial and antitumor activity as pharmaceutical compositions in combination with a compatible pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. These compositions may also contain other antimicrobial and or antitumor agents. The compositions may be made up in any pharmaceutically appropriate form for the desired route of administration. Examples of such forms include solid forms for oral administration as tablets, capsules, pills, powders and granules, liquid forms for topical or oral administration as solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs, and forms suitable for parenteral administration such as sterile solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 or 10 to about 70 percent of the active ingredient.Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term preparation1 is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included. Tablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing, and thickening agents as desired.Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, i.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium catboxymethylcellulose, and other well known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These particular solid form preparations are most conveniently provided in unit dose form and as such are used to provide a single liquid dosage unit. Alternately, sufficient solid may be provided so that after conversion to liquid form, multiple individual liquid doses may be obtained by measuring predetermined volumes of the liquid form preparation as with a syringe, teaspoon, or other volumetric container. When multiple liquid doses are so prepared, it is preferred to maintain the unused portion of said liquid doses at low temperature i.e., under refrigeration in order to retard possible decomposition.The solid form preparations intended to be converted to liquid form may contain, in addition to the active material, flavorants, colorants, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. The liquid utilized for preparing the liquid form preparation may be water, isotonic water, ethanol, glycerine, propylene glycol, and the like as well as mixtures thereof. Naturally, the liquid utilized will be chosen with regard to the route of administration, for example, liquid preparations containing large amounts of ethanol are not suitable for parenteral use. However, the antibiotic compound CL 1957A and its salts have been found to be unexpectedly unstable at room temperature both in the pure, solid form and in combination with many nontoxic, pharmaceutically acceptable liquid solvents normally employed in the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions. For example, as illustrated by the data inTable XV, solid preparations of the pure compound were found to be insufficiently stable for pharmaceutical use. Solutions of CL 1957A were prepared in various solvents at concentrations of 4 mg ml and 0.5 ml aliquots of the resulting solution were placed in 6 ml vials and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The e thin film preparations which resulted were assayed for stability by comparing the purity of the film against a standard sample by HPLC techniques. The data in Table XV illustrate that the thin film preparations of CL 1957A were not stable for periods of even one week, with the exception of the ascorbate containing preparation which began to show some decomposition after about one month.

This instability of CL 1957A in the pure, solid form, or in solution preparations in certain pharmaceutically acceptable solvents, presents particular difficulties relating to the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions containing the compound or one of its salts, since any commercially viable pharmaceutical preparation containing CL 1957A must have acceptable shelf life. As evidenced by the data of Table XVI, however, the compound has been found to be stable in solutions in lower alcohols such as 95 ethanol, absolute ethanol, and propylene glycol, and such solutions are sufficiently stable for use as pharmaceutical preparations.

In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet, or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 500 mg preferably to 5 to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. The e compositions can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents. In therapeutic use, the mammalian dosage range for a 70 kg subject is from 1 to 1500 mg kg of body weight per day or preferably 2 to 750 mg kg of body weight per day. The e dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.
