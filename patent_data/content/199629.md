# BANDED TIRE BUILDING METHOD

## Abstract
An annular band 35 is positioned between a tire carcass 20 and the crown portion 23 . The band is comprised of individual laminate sheets 36, 38 that are pre impregnated with a high fracture toughness resin that resists microtears. The individual sheets of the band are stitched together 40 thereby enhancing the interlaminar shear resistance of the band. The curing process is expedited by co curing the band, positioned in place, over the tire carcass. A plastic film 48 covers the interface between the band and adjacent rubber to prevent contamination of the interface materials.
