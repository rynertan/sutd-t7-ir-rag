# Ion implanted reverse conducting thyristor.

## Abstract
A method for making a pnpn semiconductor reverse conducting thyristor comprises the steps of forming n type semiconductor layers on both sides of a p type semiconductor substrate for forming an n type emitter layer and an n type anode base layer. A p type semi conductor impurity region is formed in the n type anode base layer for forming a p type anode layer. A p type semiconductor layer is ion implanted in the p type sub strate adjacent to the n type cathode emitter layer by irra diating it with boron atoms.
