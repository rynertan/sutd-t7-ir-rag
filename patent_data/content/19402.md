# Chemical milling composition, with maskant application process and apparatus.

## Abstract
A process for applying a volatile liquid maskant to an article to be subjected to chemical milling includes the steps a providing a controlled temperature bath of said volatile maskant characterized as fast drying, and also providing a vapor blanket overlying the bath, b placing the article into position above the level of the bath and blanket, and adjusting the temperature of the article in relation to the bath temperature, c lowering the article through the blanket into the bath, and withdrawing the article upwardly from the bath and through the blanket at a controlled rate characterized in that the maskant coats the article to controlled coat thickness, and also in that the bath remains substantially free of return drainage of maskant off the withdrawn article, d and, following said upward withdrawal, flowing a gas stream into contact with the maskant coat while the article remains above the level of the bath to assist in rapid drying of the maskant. The apparatus comprises a tank 11 to receive a controlled temperature bath of the liquid maskant 12 , cooling coils 23 located just above the top level of the bath and an enclosure 25 placed above the tank and adapted to receive the article 16 to be lowered on withdrawn from the bath. Said enclosure 25 further includes means 35, 36 for flowing gaseous streams in contact with the article 16 .
