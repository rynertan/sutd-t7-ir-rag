## Description
CATIONIC OLIGOPEPTIDES HAVING MICROBICIDAL ACTIVITY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention There is a continued interest in the development of novel microbicides which do not have adverse effects on the host, but have high potency against an undesirable pathogen or other microorganism.One area of interest in locating compounds which are microbicidally active are naturally occurring compounds which a host uses in its natural defense. The function of alveolar macrophages in host defense is well documented and numerous reports have been made describing their microbicidal proficiency. See particularlyHocking and Golde, N. Engl. J. Med. 1979 301 580 587, 639 645. However, relatively little is known concerning the microbicidal mechanisms used by the alveolar macrophages Rabbit granulocytes have been shown to contain microbicidal lysosomal cationic proteins, certain of which kill microorganisms.As macrophages and granulocytes are thought to arise from a common stem cell and as these cells contain certain constituents in common e.g. lysozyme , alveolar macrophages appear to be a potential source of compounds having microbicidal activity. In order for naturally occurring compositions to be useful, there are many criteria. If one is to synthesize an oligopeptide, it is desirable that the number of amino acid units be relatively small. While hybrid DNA technology offers an opportunity to make large proteins, where a microbicidal protein is of interest, the toxic effect of the product on the host evidently creates difficulties in its economic synthesis. Secondly, the microbicidal compound should be independently active and not reguire the presence of a number of other materials for its activity. Where only a mixture of materials have the microbicidal acti , fcrmulation problems can become severe.Thirdly, one is concerned with the environment in which the naturally occurring compound is active, that is, whether the naturally occurring compound can be formulated in such a way as to be acceptable to the host to be protected from the invading microorganism.Furthermore, by determining the amino acid composition and specific sequence, the peptide may be varied to enhance such properties as stability to degradation, biocidal activity, spectrum activity, and the like.Compounds having biocidal activity against a wide variety of microorganism are particularly important where there is no adverse effect on the host.Description of the Prior Art Zeya and Spitznagel, J.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Novel antimicrobial oligopeptides are provided, having sequences comparable to cationic oligopeptides found in macrophage, Particularly, the antimicrobial compounds have high cysteine and basic amino acid content, particularly arginine. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Fig. 1 illustrates the effect of the peptides of the present invention on Vero cells infected with ESV 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS Microbicidal cationic proteins are provided having high cysteine and arginine content and consisting of cationic proteins derived from macrophages and granulocytes, fragments containing antimicrobial activity, and modified oligopeptides, having one or more amino acids substituted by a different amino acid. The naturally occurring oligopeptides are characterized by having six cysteines and four arginines, which are substantially conserved, and generally having not more than five amino acids having rings, particularly having not more than two aromatic amino acids and not more than two azole rings.The cysteines and arginines are dispersed throughout the oligopeptide, so that the cysteines provide for the opportunity for extensive crosslinking, intramolecularly and intermolecularly, covalently and non covalently, and the arginines provide for positive charges throughout the molecule at a wide range of pHs, so as to be highly cationic. The subject compounds may be readily attached to a wide variety of other compounds, both poly amino acids and non proteinaceous compounds through one or more sulfur linkages or peptide linkages. For the most part, the compounds of this invention will have molecular weights in the range of about 3000 4000, usually 3600 3900 daltons. The subject compounds will show antimicrobial activity against a wide range of organisms, including viruses, bacteria and fungi The framework polypeptide will for the most part have the following formula Z0 2 aaÚ aaê aa4 cys arg aa7 aa8 aa9 cys aaÚÚ aaÚê aaÚ glu arg aa16 aa17 gly aa19 cys aaêÚ aaêê aaê gly aa25 aa26aa27 aa28 aa29 cys 32 cys aa w wherein Z is bonded to the terminal amino and may be an acyl group, usually acyl of from to 1 to 6 carbon atoms, particularly having an amino substituent, more particularly alpha amino, e.g. amino acid, alkyl of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, usually methyl or a protective group e.g. t butyloxycarbonyl aa intends amino acid and the superscript the position of the amino acid, with the proviso that there 9 may be an additional amino acid between aa and the cys which would otherwise be aa10, with all of the subsequent superscripts increased by one digit when counting for the actual oomposition, both in the above formula and in the subsequent definitions the additional amino acid after aa9 will be an aliphatic amino acid, particularly having an alkyl group of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, nitre particularly leucine and amino acids 1 , 4, 17, and 22 , being aliphatic neutral amino acids, where the amino acids with the asterisk are unsubstituted aliphatic amino acids, and the other amino acids being unsubstituted or hydroxyl substituted, i.e., serine and threonine amino acids 7 and 25 are either unsubstituted aliphatic amino acids or basic amino acids w is the terminal hydroxyl, amino, or a peptide of from one to six, usually one to three, more usually one to two, amino acids, having a basic aliphatic amino acid, arg or lys, at the N terminus, where the amino acids may be added to enhance one or more properties of the oligopeptides the remaining amino acids are neutral, acidic, basic, polar, aromatic or heterocyclic amino acids. The neutral amino acids, namely the unsubstituted aliphatic amino acids glycine and alkyl substituted glycines, have alkyl groups of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, i.e., alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine, and the chalcogen substituted amino acids have oxy and mercapto substituents, particularly methylthio, i.e., serine, threonine, cysteine and methionine usually cysteine will not be included in this grouping . The acidic amino acids are aspartic and glutamic acid. The basic amino acids are the aliphatic amino acids arginine and lysine. The polar amino acids are asparagine and glutamine. The aromatic amino acids are phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. The heterocyclic amino acids are histidine, proline and hydroxyproline. A preferred group of polypeptides has aal val or gly aa2 val, ile, arg, ser or phe 4 aa ala, val or thr 7 aa basic amino acid, particularly arg and lys, or gly aa8 ala, arg, gln or phe aa9 leu includes 21eu , phe or ser aa11 leu, pro, ser or gly aaÚê pro, asn, tyr, phe or ser aa13 arg, leu, ser or gly 16 arg, phe or ala 17 aa ala, ser or ile 19 phe, tyr, asp or ser aa21 arg, lys or thr 22 ile or val aa23 arg or asn aa25 arg, ala or val aa26 ile or arg aa27 his, tyr or phe aa28 pro, val or thr aa29 leu, arg or phe aa32 arg, ser or pro and w 0 2 arg, particularly 1 to 2. Usually, there will be not more than four, more usually not more than two aromatic amino acids and usually not more than two acidic amino acids, usually from one to two acidic amino acids, in the preferred compositions. Particularly, only one oligopeptide will have four aromatic amino acids, particulary phe and tyr, usually two each. One group of compounds coming within this invention will have the following formula 0 2 aaÚ aaê cys aa4 cys arg arg aa8 aa9 cys aaÚÚ aaÚê aaÚ glu arg arg aa17 gly aa19 cys arg aaêê arg gly arg aa26 his aa28 aa29 cys cys arg arg or wherein Z is methyl, acetyl or other amino capping group, the Z indicating the N terminus of the oligopeptide, there being zero to two Z groups m is 0 or 1 amino acids are designated as aa and their position in the oligopeptide indicated by the superArabic number, where the amino acids 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 17, 22, 26, and 29 are all neutral amino acids, usually resulting in hydrophobic regions in the polypeptide, being aliphatic amino acids having either hydrogen or an alkyl group of from one to five carbon atoms at the alpha position or having a chalcogen substituent, which is generally hydroxy or methylthio amino acids 12, 27 and 28 are heterocyclic, with 12 and 28 being proline or hydroxyproline and 27 being histidine amino acid 19 is an aromatic amino acid, particularly phe and amino acid 13 is either an aliphatic amino acid as described above or a basic amino acid, particularly either leu or arg. Of particular interest are amino acids 4, 8 and 17, being either glycine or alanine, with the remaining of the neutral amino acids being the aliphatic amino acids valine, leucine or isoleucine. Another group of compounds of particular interest has the following formula 0 2 val aaê cys thr cys arg aa7 phe aa9 cys gly aaÚê gly gln arg ala aa17 gly aa19 cys thr aaêê asn gly val arg his aa28 leu cys cys arg arg 0 1 wherein Z has been defined previously aa2 and aal2 are chalcogen substituted amino acids, partiçularly ser or phe aa is arg or gly aa9is phe or leu leu 21eu aa17, aa19, and aa28 are chalcogen substituted amino acids, particularly the hydroxy substituted amino acids ser and thr, particularly with aa17 and aal9 being ser and aa28 being thr and aa22 is an aliphatic amino acid of from 5 to 6 carbon atoms, particularly val or ile aa29 is leu where the order in which the amino acids are named indicates the preferred association in the polypeptide.

Another group of polypeptides related to polypeptides of rabbit neutrophils has the following formula val cys thr cys arg phe cys ser thr asn gly val arg his thr leu cys cys arg arg 0 1 where the same limitations concerning the positions above and below apply as indicated for the previous formula. Quite evidently, one or more of the various amino acids may be exchanged for a different amino acid, without detrimentally affecting the biological activity of the oligopeptides. Furthermore, fragments may find use in providing for antimicrobial activity and avoiding the necessity of preparing a 32 or 33 amino acid oligopeptide. Furthermore, while the naturally occurring amino acids are theL stereoisomers, it is known that one can obtain advantages by replacing one or more glycines or alanines with the unnatural D alanine to resist degradation. Another modification is that available carboxylic acid groups may be modified by amidification with ammonia or low molecular weight amines, e.g.alkylamines of from one to three carbon atoms, particularly methylamine. Furthermore, the terminal amino group may be modified by acylation, e.g. acetylation, alkylation, particularly with lower alkyl groups of from one to three carbon atoms, more particularly methyl, or with linking groups to link to another molecule, such as a protein or non proteinaceous molecule. Convenient linking groups are dialdehydes, dicarboxylic acids, etc. Other available amino groups may also be sites for linking. Other modifications include the replacement of one or more arginines with lysines and glutamic acid with aspartic acid and vice versa. The compounds are shown to have activity against a wide variety of microorganisms, such as bacteria, both Gram positive and negative, fungi, protozoa and viruses. Different compositions will have differing degrees of activity toward different organisms. The compositions can have opsonin activity, aiding in the phagocytosis of invading pathogens. The oligopeptides may be used in a wide variety of compositions, depending upon their purpose.For example, small amounts of the oligopeptides may be combined with other proteins to act as preservatives to protect the proteins against bacterial degradation.Alternatively, the subject compositions may be used as preservatives and disinfectants in a wide variety of formulations, such as contact lens solutions, ointments, shampoos, medicaments, foods, and the like.The amount of the oligopeptide which is employed may be varied depending upon the nature of the other components, the degree of protection desired, and the use of the composition. Usually, the concentration will be at least about 0.01 weight percent and not more than about 5 weight percent. Where the oligopeptides are to be used as antimicrobial agents, they can be formulated in buffered aqueous media containing a variety of salts and buffers. The salts will for the most part be alkali and alkaline earth halides, phosphates, and sulfates, e.g. sodium chloride, potassium chloride or sodium sulfate. Various buffers may be used, such as citrate, phosphate, HEPES, Tris, or the like, to the extent that such buffers are physiologically acceptable to the host which is being treated with the oligopeptides. The salts will be generally present in from about 10 to about 5x102M. Ionic strength will generally range from about 10 6 to about 0.01, and usually from about 10 5 to about 5x10 3. The pH will generally range from about 6.5 to 8.0, more usually from about 6.5 to 7.8, with the effect attenuating with decreasing pH. In some applications, the oligopeptides will be dissolved in physiologic buffers. Various excipients or other additives may be used, where the compounds are formulated as lyophilized powders, for subsequent use in solution. The excipients may include various polyols, inert powders or other extenders. Depending on the nature of the formulation and the host, the subject compounds may be administered in a variety of ways. The formulations may be applied topically, by injection, e.g. intravenously, intraperitoneally, etc., nasopharyngeally, etc. The subject oligopeptides can be obtained by synthesis, from alveolar macrophages and from polymorphonuclear leukocyte lysosomes. The subject cationic oligopeptides may also be found in other phagocytotic cells. The compositions can be obtained free of other materials present in their naturally occurring environment and can be used individually or in combination in any ratio. The subject compositions can be obtained in purities of greater than about 99 weight percent, being free of cellular debris and host cell components which may be detrimental to the intended use of the subject compounds. Depending upon the method of preparation, small amounts of contaminants may be present from the mammalian cell source, usually not exceeding about 5 weight percent. For many applications, the purity will not be a significant factor. Where the polypeptides are made by synthetic means, a portion of the polypep tic ill be shorter than the desired sequence and may differ in retaining blocking groups. Where hybrid DNA technology is employed lower unicellular microorganism debris or components of such organisms may be present, generally in less than 1 weight percent, usually in less than about O.01 weight percent. The alveolar macrophages may be obtained by lavaging the lung in situ after the animal is sacrificed by a toxic injection e.g. sodium pentobarbital. The lavage fluid is conveniently a supplemented phosphate buffered saline having a pH in the range from about 7 to 8. The fluid is introduced serially to remove free macrophages and the washings combined and purified to remove cells other than the cells of interest. The total number of granulocytes is reduced to less than about 1 of the total number of cells.The number of macrophages is enhanced by injecting the mammalian host with complete Preundls adjuvant about 3 to 4 weeks before sacrificing the host The cells are homogenized in an aqueous sucrose medium, generally from about 0.3 to 0.4M, unbroken cells and nuclei removed by centrifugation and after dilution, the hoogenates are centrifuged at about 25 30,OOOxg at 40C. The fungicidal and other acid soluble proteins are extracted using citrate or acetate, at about 0.005 to 0.1M, pH 2.5 3. After extraction, the solution is centrifuged again at about 25 30,000xg and the protein collected. After concentration, the protein fraction is dialyzed against an appropriate buffer, followed by purification by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis, particularly with a polyacrylamide gel having a high amount of polyacrylamide, usually from about 12 to 18 , preferably about 15 . Also included in the gel is about 2 to 6M urea, preferably about 2.5 to 5M urea. The cationic proteins may be further purified by electro elution using 0.5 28 acetic acid buffer containing 5 8 urea. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. EXPERIMENTAL Materials and MethodsExtraction of lysosome rich fraction. Elicted rabbit alveolar macrophages were purified el granulocytes , and subcellular fractions were prepared as previously described PattersonDelafield et al., Infection and Immunity 1980 30 180 192, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference . A 27,000xg fraction, derived from approximately 109 purified macrophages, was extracted with lOml of O.1M citric acid by stirring the suspended organelles for 2h at 40C. The preparation was centrifuged at 27,000xg for 20min at 40C, and the sediment was extracted as before. The combined supernatants contained approximately 2mg of protein per 108 macrophages. The citric acid extracts were concentrated to approximately lml by using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit with a UM 2 Diaflo membrane Amicon Corp.,Lexington, Mass. .Precipitation of cationic proteins. The concentrates were dialyzed against two changes, 1L each, of 0.05M HEPES buffer N 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. , pH 7.5, for 24h at 40C.This yielded a white, flocculent, biologically active precipitate, the HEPES precipitate, which was recovered by centrifugation at 27,000xg for 2Omin at 40C. Neither increasing the concentration of HEPES buffer 0.01 to O.1M nor increasing the dialysis time up to 72h increased the quantity of the precipitate. The HEPES precipitate was dissolved in 0.1M HC1 and dielyzed against two changes, IL each, of O.QlM HC1 for 24h at room temperature. Dialyzed HEPES precipitate withstood storage at 200C for at least 2 months without losing microbicidal activity. Occasionally, a translucent precipitate, insoluble in 0.1M HC1, appeared after freezing and thawing. This was removed by centrifugation without concomitant loss pf microbicidal activity.Gel filtration. Dialyzed HEPES precipitate 1ml, 2 to 3mg of protein was applied to a plastic column 1.2 by 28cm containing Bio Gel P 10, 50 100 mesh Bio RadLaboratories, Richmond, Calif. that had been equilibrated at room temperature in 0.01M HCl. Loading and elution were accomplished at a constant linear flow rate, 6cm h, of O.O1M HCl, and lml fractions were collected, The effluent was monitored by measuring its optical density at 215nm OD215 and OD225 in a GilfordModel 222A spectrophotometer and then calculating the difference OD215 OD225 . Column fractions were also examined for fungicidal activity see below . The single candidacidally active peak peak 3 was pooled, lyophilized this removed the HCl , suspended in lml of water1 and stored at 200C.Preparations destined for subsequent microbicidal testing were stabilized by adding O.lmg of crystalline bovine serum albumin per ml before freezing. Such stabilized preparations retained full microbicidal activity for several months despite repeated freeze thawing. Fractions to be further purified were stored without bovine serum albumin. Fungicidal activity of column eluates was monitored by minor modifications of a dye exclusion assay Lehrer et al., ibid 1975 11 1126 1234 . Briefly, C. parapsilosis was grown for 48h in tryptose phosphate broth Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich. at 320C, harvested by centrifugation, and washed three times with sterile distilled water. The fungi were adjusted to 2.5 x 107 cells per ml in 0,1M sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.3. A 50p1 sample of C. parapsilosis suspension was added to 10 l of each column eluate fraction in a microtest plate no. 3040 FalconPlastics, Oxnard, Calif. and incubated overnight at room temperature. Then 30p1 of an aqueous solution of trypan blue 0.2 and eosin 0.1 , pH 6.4, was added to each well. After lh, the percentage of stained yeast cells was determined by examining wet mounts microscopically.Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analytical disc native tube gels were cast with 15 acrylamide and electrophoresed at pH 4.3, 2 mA gel, by using the procedure described in Lehrer et al., supra. Long urea gels, as described by Panyim andChalkley, Biochemistry 1969 8 3972 3979, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, were used for the final purification step. Briefly, 15 polyacrylamide gels 0.5 by 25cm containing 2.5M urea were polymerized with ammonium persulfate and preelectrophoresed at 2 mA gel for 18h with 2.5M urea in 0.9M acetic acid. After pre electrophoresis, a stacking gel 0.4ml containing 2.5M urea was photopolymerized with riboflavin as described byReisfeld et al., Nature London 1962 195 281 283. Samples applied to the urea gels contained lOOg Lowry protein of the fungicidal proteins eluted from theBio Gel P 10 column, 10 vol vol , glycerol, 2.5M urea, and 0.001 methyl green as tracking dye.Electrophoresis, 2 mA gel, was performed until the dye front was lam from the bottom of the gel. Analytical gels were stained for lh in O.28 amido black dissolved in water containing 45 methanol and 9 acetic acid, and destained, by diffusion, in the same solvent. Alternatively, they were stained by the rapid Coomassie blue G 250 method of Reisner et al., Anal. Biochem. 1975 64 509 516. Localization of protein bands in preparative urea gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were removed from their tubes and quartered longitudinally. This indicator strip was stained with Coomassie blue G 250 until the protein bands were visible a few minutes .Approximate Rf s for microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2 MCP 1 and MCP 2 were 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. Using the stained gel slice as a guidestrip, a 2cm section from the unstained gels containing the two protein bands was removed and sliced transversely into Zmm sections that were individually immersed in 250 l of water. After 12h, 50p1 of the eluted proteins plus 10 11 of 0.1 NaBC03 was re electrophoresed on small analytical gels and stained to localize the bands. Gel eluates containing a single protein species were appropriately pooled and frozen. Eluates containing mixtures of the two proteins were reelectrophoresed on long urea gels and reprocessed as above. The pooled NCP 1 and MCP 2 acrylamide segments were separately pulverized and thoroughly eluted by twice agitating the suspension at room temperature for 12h with Sml of water. The gel pieces were removed by centrifugation, washed twice with water, and filtered through an Amicon X 100 membrane. The filtrates were combined and dialyzed against two changes, lL each, of lmM HCl for 24h at room temperature. The dialyzed proteins were concentrated to approximately 1ml in aSpeed Vac concentrator 100 Savant Instruments, Inc., Hicksville, N.Y. and stored at 200C. Densitometry. MCP 1 and MCP 2 eluted from 2.5M urea gels and hen egg white lysozyme were quantitated by gel densitometry. The protein concentration of the individual cationic protein samples was measured by the method of Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1951 1 193 263 275, with egg white lysozyme, IE281 5 26.4 as a standard. The proteins were applied to analytical 15 acrylamide gels pH 4.3 , electrophoresed, stained, and destained as described for amido black. The gels were scanned in a Gilford gel scanner, Model 2520, at 580nm at a scan rate of 0.5cm h and a chart speed of 150cm h. Densitometric traces were measured with aKeuffel Esser model 62 0000 compensating polar planimeter Keuffel Esser, Morristown, N.J. . Estimates of concentration were done on gels whose samples were in the linear portion of the densitometric standard curve, as described below.Amino acid analysis. Amino acid analyses were performed on aDurrum D 500 automatic amino acid analyzer by the method of Moore and Stein, Methods Enzym. 1963 , 6 819, employing single column methodology. Triplicate samples were hydrolyzed in l.Oml of 6N HC1 containing 20p1 of 5 twt vol phenol for 24h at 110i20C in vacuo.Half cystine content was determined as cysteic acid on separate duplicate samples after performic acid oxidation Moore, J. Biol. Chem. 1963 238 235 237 . Threonine and serine contents were corrected upward 5 and 10 , respectively, for destruction during acid hydrolysis. Tryptophan content was not determined.Microorganisms and microbicidal assays. Salmonella typhimurium SL 4045 and Listeria monocytogenes were grown as previously described Patterson Delafield, supra . C. albicans 820 was cultivated in Sabouraud dextrose broth BBLMicrobiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md. . Overnight cultures 5ml were grown in liquid medium with agitation at 37 C. A 1 50 dilution was made into 50ml of prewarmed medium contained in a 125ml Ehrlenmeyer flask, and this subculture was shaken at 370C until the midphase of exponential growth was attained. The sid log phase organisms were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in assay buffer see below , and suspended to a final cell density of 5xlO6 ml in that buffer.The assay buffer ionic strength, 0.02 contained O.OlH sodium citrate, 5x1O4M MgSO4, 1.5x10 4M CaCl2, and 0.056M glucose pH 6.3 .Reaction mixtures 0.5 ml contained 5x105 colony forming units in buffer at 37 C. Microbicidal proteins were added last. Timed samples were removed and serially diluted in 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing the aforementioned additives. The dilution buffer was found experimentally to block the lethal expression of unadsorbed macrophage cationic proteins, allowing precise timing of the kinetics of microbicidal activity. The ionic strength of all buffers was measured with a Yellow Springs Instruments model 31 conductivity bridge, using NaCl solutions as standards. An alternative purification procedure follows, which provides for substantially pure products. Purification of MCP 1 and MCP 2. Lyophilized protein 6.6 to 9.6 mg was dissolved in 3.0it1 of a solution of 1.0 acetic acid containing 4.5M urea Pierce Chemical Co. . This material was subjected to preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 3mm x 160mm x 200mm slab gels, using the system described by Panyim and Chalkley, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969 130 337 346. The resolving gel, of 12.5 acrylamide, was surmounted by a shallow 15mm , 7.5 acrylamide spacer gel that had been polymerized around a 3mm x 18mm x 140mm sample well former. The use of this lower density spacer gel was found to be critical for avoiding band tailing at the resolving gel s edges.Preparative gels contained 5.OM urea and had an acrylamide bis acrylamide ratio of 37.5 1. The gels were pre run overnight at a constant 125V with 0.9M acetic acid as the reservoir buffer, using clearance of methyl green Natheson, Cole and Bell to verify completeness of the process. The sample was electrophoresed toward the cathode at constant voltage, 125V, for approximately 7h until its methyl green dye 2pg ml of sample had electrophoresed off the gel.The gel was then immersed for 30sec in a 0.1N NaOH solution containing 0.25 w v eosin Y Sigma ChemicalCo. , and then rinsed for 30sec in distilled water.This brief exposure to eosin disclosed several bright orange bands, the most prominent of which corresponded to MCP 1, MCP 2, and lysozyme. The gel regions containing these bands were precisely cut from the slab with a pizza slicer Thrifty Drug and Discount, Inc. and stored at 20 C. After approximately 2ml of a 7.5 acrylamide gel solution had been polymerized in a 15ml conical plastic centrifuge tube Corning Glass Works , the tube s bottom was cut off about lcm from the end. The acrylamide plug, supported by the slanting walls of the tube, remained. After several such tubes were preelectrophoresized for 2h at 150V, their plug containing tips were fitted with short sections, approximately 8cm long, of dialysis tubing completely filled with 1 v v acetic acid. After slices of the eosin stained gel had been inserted into the plugged electro elution tubes, they were filled to within 0.5cm from the top with 1 acetic acid containing 6.OM urea.Reservoir buffer, 1 acetic acid, was layered about the acetic acid urea solution, and finally poured into the upper and lower electrophoresis chambers. Electrophoresis was performed at lOOV for 16h. During this electroelution, the eosin migrated anodally, and the peptides moved cathodally into the dialysis sac. The current was reversed for the final 2min of the procedure to abet recovery of any protein or peptide adsorbed to the dialysis membrane. The electro eluted material was recovered, transferred to fresh tubing, dialyzed against 0.1 acetic acid, and stored at 200C, or lyophilized.Analytical Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis. The linm analytical slab gels were stained for lh in a solution containing 0.1 Coomassie brilliant blue Sigma in acetic acid methanol water 10 30 60 and destained by diffusion in acetic acid methanol water 10 10 80 . The acid urea gels were identical to those described above with exception that a multiple sample well former was used. The efficiency of the purification scheme was assessed quantitatively as follows. Briefly, analytical acid urrea gels were loaded with various amounts of MCP 1 and MCP 2 standards as well as the crude starting material. After electrophoresis, gels were stained as described above, and theCoomassie stained MCP 1 and MCP 2 bands were cut from the gel and eluted in 2.0ml of 60 formic acid for 24h Gibson and Gracy, Anal. Biochem. 1979 96 352 354 .The amount of Coomassie stain eluted was measured spectrophotometrically at 650nm, and bore a linear relationship to the amount of MCP loaded on the gel, in the range of 1 to 10 g of peptide per band.Estimations of Molecular Weight. The method of Hedrick and Smith Arch. Bioches. hiophys. 1968 126 155 164 was used to estimate the molecular weight of non reduced MCP 1 andMCP 2. Briefly, the peptides and non reduced standards were electrophoresed in a series of acid urea gels with acrylamide concentrations of 10.0, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, and 20 . The log of the migration Rm of MCP 1 andMCP 2, and of the standards was plotted against the acrylamide concentration the slope tretardation quotient is related to the protein peptide molecular weight. The sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel system described by Shapiro et al. Biochem. Biophys.Res. Comm. 1967 28 815 820 was employed for molecular weight estimations of reduced MCP 1 andMCP 2, and that of Laemmli Nature London 1970 227 680 685 was used for purity assessment.Prestained, low molecular weight standards BethesdaResearch Laboratories were used as standards in molecular weight determinations. Samples were reduced by boiling for Smin in sample buffer containing 2 mercaptoethanol.Gel Filtration in Guanidine Hydrochloride. The apparent molecular weights of MCP 1 andMCP 2 were also determined by gel filtration on a 1.5 x 86.5cm Bio Gel P 60 100 200 mesh, Bio RadLaboratories column equilibrated in 6.0M guanidine HC1, O.Q5M Tris HC1, pH 8.52 Fish et al., J. Biol.Chem. 1969 214 4989 4994 . Purified MCP 1 and MCP 2, and calibration standards were reduced with dithiothreitol DTT and then carboxymethylated with an excess of iodoacetic acid Sigma . The labeled peptides were separated from reaction products by passing the mixture over a Bio Gel P 2 column 50 100 mesh, 1.5cm x 26cm , equilibrated in 6.0M guanidine HC1, 0.05M Tris HCl, pH8.52. MCP containing fractions, which eluted at the void volume, were pooled, and used as such for chromatography on the P 60 column, or dialyzed against 0.18 acetic acid and lyophilized.Reduced and alkylated standards used for calibration were horse heart cytochrome C N 104, Sigma , aprotinin M 58, Sigma , insulin B chain N 30,Boeringer Mannheim , and insulin A chain N 21,Sigma , where N the number of amino acids in the peptide chain. Reduced and alkylated transferrin MW 90,000 , and methyl green were chromatographic indicators of the void and included volumes, respectively.In the case of the reduction and alkylation of MCP 1 and MCP 2, carboxymethylation was performed using H iodoacetate New England Nuclear in order to generate isotopically labeled peptides. The column was calibrated as described byFish et al., supra. The method of Porath Pure Appl. Chem. 1963 6 233 244 was used for determining Kd, the distribution coefficient Ve Vo Kd Vi Vo where Ve is the position of the standard or MCP elution peak, V. is the included volume, and Vo is the void volume. Kd was determined experimentally using the volume and or time of peak elution by continuously monitoring the column effluent with an ISCO UA 5 recording absorbance monitor A280 in conjunction with an ISCO Model 328 fraction collector. A standard curve wherein Kd 1 3 was plotted against N0.555 was constructed Fish et al., supra . The Xd s for H MCP 1 and H MCP 2 were determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry of column effluent fractions, using a Beckman Model LS 330Liquid Scintillation Counter. Calibration standards, and V0 and V. indicators were included with each loading of H MCP 1 or H MCP 2. Chemical Analysis of MCP 1 and MCP 2. MCP 1 and MCP 2 were analyzed for free sulfhydryls by reaction with 5,5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoate DTNB in 6.OM guanidine hydrochloride, 0.05MTris HCl, pH 8.52 Glazer et al. 1975 ChemicalModification of Proteins Work, T.S. and Work, E. eds. North Holland American Elsevier . Carbohydrate content of MCP 1 and MCP 2 was determined by the phenol sulfuric acid procedure Dubois et al., Anal.Chem. 1956 28 350 356 . The tyrosine and tryptophan content of MCP 1 and MCP 2 was determined spectrophotometrically by the method of Edelhoch Biochem. 1967 6 1948 1954 . Protein determinations using the Lowry J. Biol. Chem. 1951 193 262 275 , o phthalaldehyde Robrish et al., Anal. Biochem. 1978 84 196 204 , and A215 A225 Murphy and Kies, Biochem.Biophys. Acta. 1960 45 382 384 methods were compared. The absorbance spectra of MCP 1 and MCP 2 were recorded in a Beckman Model 24 dual beam spectrophotometer. For this analysis, the peptides were lyophilized and dissolved in lmM sodium acetate, pH 6.3. The various methods of protein determination gave values which varied by no more than about 20 between methods. The average values of the various methods most closely approximated those determined by the microbiuret assay, which was the chosen method thereafter. In the urea containing SDS PAGE system ofShapiro et al., the apparent molecular weights of reduced MCP 1 and MCP 2 was estimated to be 4700 and 4300 daltons, respectively. The observation that the apparent molecular weight did not decrease under reducing conditions suggest that the peptides exist as single polypeptide chains. Molecular weight determinations by gel chromatography of reduced and carboxymethylated MCP 1 and MCP 2 in 6.OM guanidine hydrochloride confirmed the results. The data showed that the reduced and carhoxymethylated MCP 1 and MCP 2 eluted at the same Ve. The elution peaks of both MCP 1 and MCP 2 were symmetrical, each corresponding to a single polypeptide chain with an average integer value of 41 amino acids.The molecular weights of MCP 1 and ScP 2 were calculated, based on the mean residue weight, Mo to be 4476 19 and 4395 15, respectively.The absence of tryptophan and tyrosine was indicated spectrophotometrically Titration of MCP 1 and MCP 2 with DTNB in 6.0M guanidine hydrochloride showed no evidence of oxidation, indicating the absence of available sulfhydryl groups. This observation is consistent with the other observation that neither MCP 1 nor MCP 2 reacted with iodoacetate without previous reduction.Neither MCP 1 nor MCP 2 contain any carbohydrate as assessed by the phenol sulfuric acid assay. The test was performed under conditions whereby 0.5 glucoseequivalents per molecule of MCP would have been detected. The neutrophil proteins NP were prepared substantially the same way as the macrophage proteins, with the following differences. Rabbit peritoneal neutrophils were extracted with 0.1M citric acid at 4 C for 24h at a concentration of about 1010 cells per 50ml. The solution was then dialysed and electrophoresed as described for the MCP compounds, yielding five fractions. The fractions were then further purified and the fraction having 3A and 3B separated into two pure components by HPLC. A reverse phase C18 Vidak HPLC column was employed, eluting with solutions having frogs 2 to 28 by volume of 0.025 trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile diluted with an aqueous 0.025 trifluoroacetic acid solution.Elution took 30min yielding pure 99t pure neutrophil proteins which were lyophilized and sequenced. The sequences of the oligopeptides demonstrating the conserved portions in boxes are set forth in Table I, where the second arg may be removed by tryptic or carboxypeptidase digestion. A modified procedure was employed as follows, for obtaining the cationic proteins in a pure state.Peptide Purification. The citric acid soluble material obtained by extracting the 27,000xg postnuclear sediment or the whole sonicate was dialyzed exhaustively against 0.18 acetic acid in tubing Spectrum Industries, LosAngeles, CA with a molecular weight cutoff of 3500, lyophilized, and redissolved at 2 6mg of protein ml in 1.0 acetic acid containing 3.OM urea. 0.5 l.Sml samples of this material were electrophoresed on acidic, urea containing polyacrylamide gels, 3 x 160 x 220nm in size, for approximately 9h. Gels were subsequently immersed in a solution of 0.25 w v eosin Y Sigma, St. Louis, MO in 0.1 N NaOH for 30sec, thus disclosing up to 25 transverse magenta staining bands of protein.Gel strips containing the five most cathodal bands were individually excised from eight simultaneously run gels, pooled, and subjected to electrophoretic elution. The eluted peptides were dialyzed against 1.0 acetic acid and lyophilized.Each of the electrophoretically fractionated peptides was subjected to further purification by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography RP HPLC on aSpectraphysics SP 8700 system equipped with a Rheodyne 7125 sample injector 2.0ml loop , a Waters 450 variable wavelength detector, a Kipp and Zonen BD 40 recorder, and a large pore 330 A 1.0 x 25.0cm Vydac 218 TP C 18 column. Water acetonitrile gradients containing 0.025 trifluoroacetic acid TFA were used in elution. A 0.46 x 25cm C 18 column pBondpak, Waters was used for some analytical RP HPLC runs. Analytic Methods. Peptide purity was evaluated using RP HPLC, acid urea PAGE, and sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS PAGE.Estimations of peptide molecular weights were made based on the migration of purified samples in SDS PAGE Selsted et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1983 258 14485 14489 . The subject compounds MCP 1 and MCP 2 were found to be effective against C. albicans, L. sonocytogenes and S. typhimurium in order of decreasing effectiveness. At an ionic strength of 0.024, there was no significant change in effectiveness over the pH range from about 5.0 to 8.0 for C. albicans. In contrast, bacterial species were most susceptible to MKP 1 and XCP 2 between pH 6.5 8.0 and they showed substantially less susceptibility below pH 6.0. Ionic strength also influenced the peptides direct antimicrobial activity. At higher pH levels, a precipitate forms. While pH did not have a significant effect, ionic strength did.In a representative experiment, 3pg of a mixture of the two compounds per ml reduced the number of viable C. albicans by over 99 in 5min under standard conditions, as described previously This was unaffected in the presence of 0.1K mannitol in the assay buffer. However, increasing the ionic strength to 0.05 reduced killing to approximately 60 and increasing it to 0.08 prevented candidacidal activity. Of the three alkali metal halides employed, no difference was observed. Heating at 1000C for lOmin at a concentration of lOpg ml in assay buffer did not affect the compound s activity. It was found that MCP 1 is approximately 3 4 times as effective as MCP 2 against C. aLbicans. The subject peptides were also tested and shown to be effective in restricting replication of viruses in human, rabbit and monkey cells. This effect was demonstrated by two experimental systems. One of these measured the peptides ability to directly inactivate certain viruses e.g., Herpes simplex, Type 1 HSV 1 , Herpes simplex, Type 2 HSV 2 , Vesicular stomatitis virus VSV , etc. The protocol for testing direct viral inactivation is as follows Virus stock solutions, containing 107 to 109 plaque forming units PFU ml are incubated with various concentrations, 1 100 iig ml, of MCP 1 or MCP 2 for 30 to 60 minutes at 37 C in appropriate tissue culture TC media.Thereafter, the mixtures are serially diluted and plaqued on Vero monkey kidney cells. Exposure of HSV 1 McIntyre strain to 100 vg ml of MCP 1 or MCP 2 for 60 minutes caused the number of PFU ml to decline from 107 PFU ml to less than 104 PFU ml, in contrast to the control which showed little decrease in PFU ml. MCP 1 and MCP 2 appeared to be equally potent in causing direct viral inactivation. Other viruses susceptible to direct inactivation by MCP 1 and MCP 2 are HSV 2,VSV, vaccinia and influenza A. In addition to direct inactivation, the peptides decrease the replication of viruses includingHSV 1, HSV 2, VSV and cytomegalovirus CMV in otherwise permissive human fibroblasts e.g., GM 2504 and MRC 5 cells or rabbit and monkey kidney cells Vero . When Vero cells are infected by RSV 1, the infected cells demonstrate prominent cytopathic effects CPE consisting of cell rounding with formation of multinucleated cells with premature cell death. When the cells are exposed to HSV 1 in the presence of 25 vg ml of MCP 1, this CPE is almost completely prevented. These effects are illustrated by Figure 1, which shows the appearance of Vero cells that are a uninfected, b infected with HSV 1 McIntyre at a MOI of 0.1, and c infected with HSV 1 in the presence of 25 vg mi of MCP 1.The normal appearance of the Vero cells and the prevention of CPE are apparent. This procedure is also performed quantitatively by the following protocol. On day one, the cells, either human fibroblasts or monkey kidney, are set up. On day two, samples and interferon a controls are diluted in TC media. The cells growth medium is replaced with the TC media in which the sample polypeptide or a interferon IPN a have been serially diluted and the cells exposed to these media overnight. On day three, the media are removed and the cells infected with virus, employing the series at different MOI. After infection, in one series the sample polypeptide containing medium is returned and in another series, fresh TC medium is employed. With VSV the control concentrations were 0.1, 1, and 10 U ml, while with HSV the IFN a concentrations were tenfold higher. On day four, the cytopathic effect CPE is scored and the incubation is continued until 60 90 of the virus infected cells manifest CPE 20 27 hours forVSV and HSV 2, 30 38 hours for HSV 1 and 5 days forCMV . At this point in time, the culture fluids were harvested and plaque formation was determined. The virus yields from test samples were compared to control wells. In representative yield reduction studies, 25 g ml of MCP l caused a 4 log10 reduction in VSV yield and a 3 log10 reduction in HSV 1 yield, relative to untreated controls. In contrast, IFN a caused a 0.6 loglo decrease in HSV 1 yield when present at 100 IU ml and a 6 log10 decrease in VSV yield when present at 10IU ml in tests conducted with the human GM 2504 fibroblast cell line. To test antibacterial action of the polypeptides, the following protocol was employed. Various species at 10 bacterial cells ml are incubated for 20min at 370 with 50pg ml of the candidate peptide.Colony counts viable organists are made at the outset of the incubation before addition of the candidate peptide and after 20min of incubation with the candidate peptide. The results are found in Table II. To further demonstrate antibacterial activity the following study was performed. The procedure parallels that reported in Lehrer et al., Infection andImmunity 1983 42 10 14. Fourteen bacterial isolates, as shown in Table III, were cultivated for 16h at 370C in nutrient broth, mixed and subcultured by adding lml to 49ml of fresh nutrient broth. The subculture was grown at 370C for 4h with shaking to provide midlogarithmic phase organisms that were washed twice with buffer by centrifugation 2000xg, lOmin , and then quantitated spectrophotometrically at 620nm, with reference to previously established CFU Optical Density relationships. Bacteria were suspended and experiments were performed in lOmM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. In some experiments, buffers were supplemented with 0.14MNaCl high ionic strength . The conductivities of the standard and NaCl supplemented buffers were 1.36 and 12.3mMHO, respectively, as determined with aSybron Barnstead PM 70 CB conductivity bridge. In some experiments, lOmM phosphate buffer with a pH of 5.8 and conductivity of 1.36mMHO was used. Peptide stock solutions were prepared at 500g ml microbiuret assay in O.018 acetic acid, and stored at 200C. Typically, incubation mixtures contained 1x105 bacterial CFU and 5 g of peptide in 100 l of buffer. After incubation for 20min at 370C, 900p1 of the same buffer was added, and two additional serial tenfold dilutions were made with that buffer.Duplicate 100p1 aliquots from the three serial dilutions were spread over appropriate nutrient agar plates and incubated for 24 72h to insure full colony development. Killing of microorganisms was expressed as the logarithm10 No N, where No represented the initial colony count and N represented the colony count after incubation with peptide. There was no significant alteration in colony count when any of the test organists were exposed to peptide free buffer for 20min. It is evident from the above results, that the subject compounds can be used as antimicrobials, having broad range effectiveness against a wide variety of organisms, including viruses, bacteria and fungi.Furthermore, because the subject compounds are naturally occurring, as well as being relatively small oligopeptides, they can be used in a wide variety of applications where long persistence is undesirable.The water solubility of the subject compounds permits them to be readily formulated in a wide variety of ways with numerous compositions to provide preservative and disinfectant activity. In addition, the oligopeptides may be prepared so as to have the same or substantially the sarge amino acid sequence of a particular host, so as to avoid immunogenic problems. The relatively small size of the oligopeptides permits their ready synthesis, either through recombinant DNA or using mechanical automatic synthesizers. Also, the conserved framework allows for substantial variation in cotposition while still retaining antimicrobial activity against selected organisms. Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
