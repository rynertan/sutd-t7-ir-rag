# COOKIES WITH REDUCED SUCROSE CONTENT AND DOUGHS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
Sucrose free or reduced sucrose cookies are prepared by replacing part or all of the sucrose with a combination of a glass forming polysaccharide preferably a maltodextrin and a humectant sugar comprising lactose and or dextrose. Multi textured cookies can be prepared using the combination of glass forming polysaccharide and humectant sugar in the firm outer layer, and a humectant sugar in the soft center.

## Claims
1. A process for preparing a cookie, which process comprises preparing at least one dough by mixing flour, a sweetening agent, and fat or shortening to form the dough, and baking the dough to form the cookie, wherein the sweetening agent comprises an edible glass forming polysaccharide and a humectant sugar, said humectant sugar comprising lactose and or dextrose.

## Description
This invention relates to cookies having reduced sucrose content, and to doughs for the production of such cookies. More specifically, the invention relates to cookies and doughs in which the sucrose content is reduced or eliminated, while still retaining a firm texture in the baked products prepared from the dough. The complete or substantial elimination of sucrose from a conventional cookie dough which contains flour, water, sucrose, shortening and minor amounts of flavorants results in a flaky texture typical of biscuits. In addition, of course, the normal sweet taste of sucrose containing cookies is lost. The changes in texture, sweetness, appearance, flavor and mouthfeel in the finished cookie produced from such a sucrose reduced or free dough are in general unattractive, and may in some cases restrict their use to dedicated dieters or people whose dietary intakes are restricted medicinally for reasons such as diabetes and excessive obeseness. Attempts have been made to use a variety of other saccharides to replace sucrose as a sweetening agent in cookie and other doughs. For example Ludewig, H.G. et al, Eingenung Verschiedener Staerkeverzucherungsprodukte zur Herstellung von Muerbkeksen Suitability of various starch derived sugar products for preparation of cookies , Getreide, Mehl und Brot, It has been reported that the addition of dextrin to bread having a high honey solids content partially overcomes the tendency of the high quantity of honey solids to decrease the volume of the bread see Glabe and Silverbrandt, Influence of Dextrin on Bread With High Honey Solids Content, Bakers Digest, This article suggests that the dextrin appears to facilitate the gluten water reaction by reducing the time necessary for the water to penetrate in to the flour protein. Interactions between wheat and soy proteins and starch and differences in the ability to bind dextrins are discussed in Dahle, L. K. et al, Wheat protein starch interaction. II. Comparative abilities of wheat and soy proteins to bind starch, Cereal Chemistry, Dextrin made by hydrolyzing waxy starch with alpha and beta amylases has been stated to improve the quality of Japanese cakes see Chemical Abstracts, Also, addition of a compound containing 40 80 percent of oils and fats, 15 50 percent of water and 1 10 percent of cyclodextrin in an amount of from 1 40 percent to rice cracker dough has been thought to markedly improve crunchiness and texture of the resultant rice crackers see Chemical Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts Fructose is potentially sweeter than sucrose. Consequently, there is a theoretical advantage to replacing sucrose, in baked products which normally contain this sugar, with a smaller quantity of fructose to provide an equivalent degree of sweetness. Fructose has an agreeable sweetness and is claimed to be 15 80 percent sweeter than sucrose. See Schallenberger, R.S., U.S. Patents Nos. 4,137,336, 4,185,127 and 4,379,174, all to Radlove, state that the use of fructose as a replacement for sucrose to reduce the calories in baked goods has met with little success because fructose loses much of its sweetness upon heating of the batter. U.S. Patent No. 4,137,336 describes a dietetic cookie mix in which torula yeast, stearoyl monoglyceridyl citrates and propylene glycol monostearate are used to enable the fructose to retain a sufficient degree of sweetness while it is heating during the cookie baking process. U.S. Patent No. 4,185,127 describes a dietetic cake mix in which crystalline fructose is combined with baking powder having gluconodelta lactone as the acidic component and emulsifiers such as propylene glycol monostearate and lactated monoglycerides to obtain a product which has an acceptably sweet taste upon baking. In U.S. Patent No. 4,379,174, high fructose corn syrup is used to replace the expensive crystalline fructose used in the dietetic cake mix described in U.S. Patent No. 4,185,127. Fructose is known to aid moisture retention in baked goods, but reportedly does not provide the texture, consistency or color that would encourage its widespread use in baked goods. See The use of other humectant sugars, such as dextrose, corn syrups, invert syrups, high fructose corn syrups, honey, molasses and mixtures thereof, as a complete replacement for sucrose to provide a desired degree of sweetness to a baked product also tends to impart a soft or plastic like texture to the baked goods. Additionally, replacement of the sucrose with at least one humectant sugar to reduce the quantity of sucrose used to less than 25 percent of the total weight of sugars, tends to result in a soft or plastic like texture. Substitution of maltodextrin e.g. maltodextrins having a dextrose equivalent DE of 5 to 7 for sucrose substantially reduces the sweetness level of the baked cookie. Moreover, although maltodextrins do produce an amorphorous, glassy solid as a result of the dehydration accompanying baking, the glass forming abilities of relatively low DE maltodextrins are such that the texture of the resultant cookie is perceived as undesirably brittle and not cookie like. Moreover, replacement of the sucrose with maltodextrins causes a very severe reduction in cookie spread. Cookie spread is known to be a relatively complex phenomenon influenced by a wide variety of factors, and numerous attempts have been made to find processes for the control of cookie spread. See, for example Among the methods for increasing cookie spread suggested in these references are addition of flour or bran lipids to the dough references I, J and M , addition of soybean or safflower lecithins to the dough references J and K , increasing the baking time at lower baking temperatures reference N , using coarse flour particles references D and P , using a cold ovenband at the time of deposition of the dough pieces reference P , decreasing the atmospheric pressure during baking reference C , elimination of the hydrophilic starch tailings or water soluble polysaccharides from flour references F, H, L and Q , using a greasy ovenband reference P , using a dough of high pH with an increase in the amount of ammonium bicarbonate references E, N, O and P , using low temperatures in the front of the oven references O and P , using a low viscosity flour references A, D and G , covering up the flour hydration sites reference B , using minimal mixing prior to dough standing reference P , pretreatment of the flour with enzymes to lower its viscosity reference A , pretreatment of the flour with sulfides and xanthates to lower its viscosity reference A and producing soft doughs using higher temperatures references B, N and P . Many of these methods are difficult or costly to apply to high throughput industrial processes for the production of cookies, and it seems doubtful whether any of these methods, alone or in combination, would overcome the very great reduction in cookie spread experienced when sucrose is replaced with maltodextrins in cookie doughs. There is thus a need for methods of reducing or eliminating the sucrose content of cookie doughs and employing maltodextrins which does not give rise to the problems of lack of sweetness, brittleness of texture and lack of spread. This invention provides such a cookie dough and cookies produced therefrom. This invention provides a process and a cookie dough composition for producing cookies having a firm texture, the process and dough composition using, as a sweetening agent, an edible glass forming polysaccharide and a humectant sugar comprising lactose and or dextrose. This invention also provides a cookie dough composition for producing a multi textured cookie in which the outer layer has a firm texture, the composition having a center formed of a first cookie dough comprising flour, fat or shortening and a humectant, and an outer layer surrounding the center, the outer layer being formed of a second cookie dough comprising flour, a fat or shortening, a glass forming polysaccharide and a humectant sugar comprising lactose and or dextrose. The term polysaccharide is used herein to denote any saccharide, or mixture of saccharides, containing an average of at least about 3 saccharide units per molecule. The term polysaccharide as used herein thus excludes pure monosaccharides and disaccharides, but includes trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides and higher polymers, together with mixtures of such higher polymers with minor amounts of mono and disaccharides, provided that the average number of saccharide units per molecule is at least about 3. In the process and cookie of the present invention, a mixture of an edible glass forming polysaccharide and a humectant sugar comprising lactose and or dextrose is used as the sweetening agent. It has been found that the use of this sweetening agent in at least one dough used to prepare the cookie provides the resultant dough portion of the baked cookie with a shelf stable firm, non brittle texture, without adversely affecting oven spread of the cookie during baking. It has been found that, in accordance with the invention, the use of an edible glass forming polysaccharide in combination with a humectant sugar in the process and cookie of the invention produces in the baked cookie a firm non brittle texture which when appropriate ratios of ingredients are employed resembles that obtained by baking a conventional sugar cookie. Conventional packaging techniques preferably are used to package the cookies of the invention, such that the firm baked dough texture produced by the glass forming polysaccharide humectant sugar sweetening agent is retained for extended periods of time. Although other glass forming polysaccharides, for example hydrolyzed cereal solids, corn syrup solids and hydrogenated starch hyrolyzates, can be used in the processes and cookies of this invention, the preferred glass forming polysaccharides are maltodextrins. Maltodextrins are commercially available products produced by hydrolysis of starch normally corn starch and are extensively discussed in the literature. See, for example As described in the above references, maltodextrins are produced by hydrolysis, normally enzymatic hydrolysis, of starch. The degree of hydrolysis effected in the starch starting material to produce a particular maltodextrin is conventionally measured as the dextrose equivalent DE of the maltodextrin. The higher the dextrose equivalent of a maltodextrin, the greater the degree of hydrolysis of the starch and the lower the average molecular weight of the maltodextrin. The dextrose equivalent of maltodextrins range from about 4 to about 25. In order to produce the optimum texture in the baked cookie, we prefer to use, in the process and compositions of the invention, maltodextrins having a dextrose equivalent of 5 to 15 and desirably 10 to 15. In such preferred maltodextrins, at least 90 percent of the weight of the carbohydrate in the maltodextrin is in the form of tetra or higher polysaccharides. Suitable maltodextrins typically have at least about 85 percent by weight of the carbohydrate in the form of tetra or higher polysaccharides. Two specific preferred commercially available maltodextrins are the materials sold by American Maize Products Company, Corn Processing Division, 1100 Indianapolis Boulevard, Hammond, Indiana 43620 under the trademarks Lo Dex 5 and 10. Lo Dex 5 contains less than 1 percent of monosaccharides, less than 2 percent of disaccharides, less than 2 percent of trisaccharides and at least 95 percent of tetra and higher polysaccharides by weight, on the basis of total weight of saccharides present , while Lo Dex 10 contains approximately 1 percent of monosaccharides, 4 percent of disaccharides, 5 percent of trisaccharides and 90 percent of tetra and higher polysaccharides. A variety of humectant sugars, for example honey, molasses, maltose, sorbose, mannose, galactose, corn syrups, high fructose corn syrups and invert syrups can be used in the processes and cookies of this invention. Mixtures of such humectant sugars can of course be used. The cookie dough desireably contains some dextrose to ensure proper browning during baking. In order to provide the desired combination of sweetness and texture in the baked cookie the humectant sugar preferably comprises a mixture of lactose and dextrose. When fructose is used, it is conveniently provided in the form of a high fructose corn syrup. High fructose corn syrups are low in cost, are highly humectant, provide a pleasant sweet taste, and are readily commercially available. They are prepared by the enzymatic isomerization of dextrose containing corn syrups, and typically possess a sugar solids component of about 40 percent to about 100 percent by weight fructose, with the balance of the non fructose sugar solids being primarily dextrose plus minor amounts of other monosaccharides. The sugar solids content of commercially available high fructose corn syrups typically ranges from about 70 percent to 73 percent, up to about 82 percent by weight. Commercially available high fructose corn syrups having at least 80 percent by weight of their solids as fructose are readily available and are preferred for use in the process and compositions of the present invention. The amounts of glass forming polysaccharide and humectant sugar used in the processes and compositions of the invention will of course vary depending upon the desired taste of the cookie, and upon the quantities of the glass forming polysaccharide and humectant sugar necessary to achieve the desired degree of cookie spread and the desired texture in the final product. Although the optimum amounts of glass forming polysaccharide and humectant sugar can of course be determined empirically by routine tests, in general it may be stated that the total quantity of glass forming polysaccharide and humectant sugar for any particular application should be approximately the same as the weight of sucrose which it replaces. The glass forming polysaccharide is suitably added to the dough in an amount of from about 4 to about 15 percent by weight of the dough. Typical amounts generally range from about 5 to about 10 percent by weight of the dough. All references herein to proportions by weight of the dough are to proportions by weight of the substantially homogeneous dough mixture itself, i.e. excluding heterogeneous inclusions such as chocolate chips, nuts, cream fillings etc. which are frequently added to cookies. The quantity of humectant sugar added to the dough is suitably from about 4 to about 12 percent by weight of the dough and preferably in an amount from about 6 to about 10 percent by weight of the dough. In order that the quantity of humectant sugar present will be sufficient to provide a proper level of sweetness, and overcome the tendency of glass forming polysaccharide containing cookies to have a brittle texture, the ratio of the amount of glass forming polysaccharide to humectant sugar is preferably adjusted. This ratio is suitably in the range of from about 1.5 1 to about 0.4 1. Higher ratios in the range of from about 3 1 to about 1 1, desirably in the range from about 2.5 1 to about 1.5 1, may be used with increasing proportions of fructose in the humectant sugar. When fructose is used, the glass forming polysaccharides may desirably be added to the dough in an amount from about 10 to about 20 percent by weight of the dough, preferably from about 12 to aobut 8 percent by weight of the dough. In the processes and compositions of the invention, sucrose typically comprises no more than about 70 percent by weight of the sweetening agent which comprises the glass forming polysaccharide, the sucrose, and the humectant sugar. The sweetening agent can be used in preparing multi textured cookies in which first and second cookie doughs are separately prepared, and a portion of the first cookie dough hereinafter referred to as the inner or filler dough is enrobed within a portion of the second cookie dough hereinafter referred to as the outer or casing dough and baked to produce a multi textured cookie in which the center derived from the filler dough and the outer layer derived from the casing dough differ in texture, the compositions of the doughs normally being chosen so that the center has a softer, more plastic like texture than the outer layer. The two cookie doughs may be combined by coextrusion through concentric dies to obtain a coextrudate rope with the filler dough inside and the casing dough outside. The coextrudate rope may then be cut into pieces using a reciprocating cutter which severs the rope and stretches the casing dough to close the end portions of the rope so as to obtain a composite dough piece in which a center formed of the filler dough is completely surrounded by an outer layer formed of the casing dough, this composite dough piece thus being bakeable to form a multi textured cookie. Apparatus for forming the composite dough piece is known in the art. The composite dough pieces bakeable to multi textured cookies preferably having a weight ratio of the filler cookie dough to the casing cookie dough within the range of from about 0.80 to about 1.2, approximately equal amounts of each dough being preferred. When the process of the invention is employed to produce such a multi textured cookie, the combination of the glass forming polysaccharide and the humectant sugar is preferably employed only in the casing dough. Any of the known sweeteners suitable for producing a soft, plastic like texture may be used in the filler dough. The filler cookie dough used in producing multi textured cookies by the process of the present invention may be any of the cookie doughs known to be capable of producing a soft or plastic like texture in the center of a multi textured cookie. As is well known to those skilled in the art a soft or plastic like texture in the center of a multi textured cookie can be achieved by including a humectant in the filler cookie dough used to produce this center. When humectants are added to a cookie dough, the product baked from such a dough will possess a plastic, moist and non hardening crumb structure, which will be retained during storage in conventional packing for periods greater than two weeks and up to several months. A wide variety of food compatible humectants may be employed for imparting shelf stable soft and moist texture to the centers of the multi textured cookies produced by the process of the present invention. Humectants which can be employed include sugar and or non sugar ingredients which bind moisture in a baked dough. If a non sugar humectant is employed, the filler cookie dough may also need to include a sugar to provide the requisite degree of sweetness to the center of the cookie. The binding should be such that the equilibrium rate of moisture loss from the cookie to the environment due to the presence of the humectant is slowed to such a degree that a multi textured cookie containing the humectant in its center, and having an initial moisture content of at least about 6 percent, retains in its center a soft and pliable texture for at least about 2 months, and preferably for at least about 4 6 months, when the cookie is stored in a closed container. Edible humectant gels such as a humectant sucrose gel and or a high fructose corn syrup gel can be used in the filler cookie dough for achieving a soft, plastic like texture which is stable for prolonged periods. Preparation of the gels and of doughs containing them for producing soft edible baked products having extended shelf life is taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,444,799. A humectant sucrose gel can be prepared, for example, from a mixture of sucrose syrup, sodium alginate, and a calcium ion source. The gels may also be prepared as taught in pending U.S. application Serial No. 712,206, filed March 15, 1985, which is a continuation of U.S. application Serial No. 580,365, filed February 15, 1984, which is a continuation in part of the application which issued as U.S. Patent No. 4,444,799. The aforementioned patent and pending application Serial No. 712,206 are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humectant sugars may be employed alone or in combination with non humectant sugars such as sucrose in the filler cookie dough to impart a soft or plastic like texture to the center of the multi textured cookie. Suitable humectant sugars include fructose, maltose, sorbose, dextrose, lactose, galactose, corn syrups, invert syrups, high fructose corn syrups, honey, molasses, as well as mixtures of one or more of the foregoing humectants with sucrose. For example, a suitable humectant sugar composition for use in the filler cookie dough may comprise about 0 to 85 percent sucrose, with the balance of the sugar being comprised of fructose and or dextrose employed in the form of crystallized sugar. Alternatively, the balance of the sugar may be provided by the sugar solids content of a corn syrup, honey or a high fructose corn syrup, or another humectant sugar. Commercially available high fructose corn syrups are prepared by the enzymatic isomerization of dextrose containing corn syrups, and typically possess a sugar solids component of about 40 percent to about 100 percent by weight fructose, with the balance of the non fructose sugar solids being primarily dextrose plus minor amounts of other monosaccharides. The sugar solids content of commercially available high fructose corn syrups typically ranges from about 70 percent to about 73 percent, up to about 82 percent by weight. When sucrose is employed in the filler cookie dough, the humectant sugar should comprise at least about 15 percent, and preferably at least about 20 percent, by weight of the total sugar solids content of the filler cookie dough. In addition to the humectant sugars, a wide variety of humectants which are not sugars all possess a low degree of sweetness relative to sucrose may also be employed in the filler cookie dough. For example, the use of glycerol, sugar alcohols such as mannitol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol, and other polyols, as humectants is well known in the art. Additional examples of humectant polyols i.e. polyhydric alcohols include humectant glycols, for example, propylene glycol, hydrogenated glucose syrups, sugar esters, dextrins, and other starch hydrolyzation products. When sucrose is employed in combination with one or more of the foregoing humectants, the humectant should comprise at least about 15 percent, and preferably at least about 20 percent, by weight of the humectant and sucrose combination. The humectant may be included in the dough as an added ingredient, or an enzyme may be included in the dough formulation which acts on a substrate also included in the dough during, before or after baking, to produce effective amounts of the humectant Enzymes suitable for use in this manner include polysaccharidases which act upon farinaceous materials to produce lower molecular weight saccharides such as glucose, maltose, modified starches, dextrins, etc. Enzymes of this type include alpha and beta amylases. Alpha amylases, such as those obtained from bacterial sources The flour and shortening employed in the process and compositions of this invention are selected from conventional ingredient lines. The flour component may be any comminuted cereal grain or edible seed meal such as wheat flour, corn flour, corn starch, modified starch, rice flour, potato flour, barley flour, or the like. Wheat flour is preferred. The wheat flour may be bleached or unbleached, although bleached flour tends to give less oven spread during baking. The shortening may be any edible fat or oil or mixtures thereof suitable for baking applications, and may further include conventional food grade emulsifiers. The shortening may be present in each dough in amounts ranging from about 20 percent to about 80 percent by weight, based upon the weight of the flour. The dough s may contain from about 0 percent to about 5 percent by weight of a leavening system, based upon the weight of the flour in each dough. The leavening system employed in each dough may be the same or different. In addition to the foregoing, the dough s may include other additives conventionally employed in cookie products. Exemplary thereof are milk products or milk by products, egg products or egg by products, cocoa, vanilla, cereal oatmeal , as well as inclusions such as nuts, raisins, coconut, flavor chips, such as chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, caramel chips, and the like. If flavor chips are to be added, they are preferably added as the last ingredient to the dough with minimal mixing so as to avoid smearing of the flavor chips into the dough. The dough s used in the process and compositions of the present invention can each be prepared in a conventional manner using a creaming stage and a dough forming stage. However, the preferred technique for admixing the glass forming polysaccharide and humectant sugar with the other ingredients of the dough in the process of the invention differs somewhat from the conventional process normally employed to mix sucrose into a sucrose containing dough. When using sucrose, part of the sucrose is mixed with the fat or shortening in the creaming stage and then the remainder of the sucrose is added together with the flour later in the dough forming stage. If this procedure is adopted with a glass forming polysaccharide, the polysaccharide tends to form undesirable lumps in the dough forming stage. In order to produce good mixing of the glass forming polysaccharide with the remaining components of the dough, we prefer to first blend the whole of the polysaccharide with the fat or shortening, and thereafter to blend the resultant mixture first with the humectant sugar and then with the flour. The time and temperature of baking the dough compositions of the present invention to prepare finished cookies are adjusted in accordance with conventional techniques to provide a moisture content in the baked cookie of about 5 percent or above. The preferred moisture content ranges from about 6 percent to about 7 percent or more, based upon the weight of the baked cookie, depending upon the texture desired. The water activity of the baked cookie should be less than about 0.7, preferably less than or equal to about 0.6, to assure microbial shelf stability. While baking time and temperatures will vary for different dough formulations, oven type, etc., in general, commercial cookie baking times may range from about 5 minutes to 15 minutes, and baking temperatures for cookies may range from about 250 F to about 500 F. The cookie dough compositions of the present invention may be used for the production of drop type cookies, such as chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, peanut butter cookies, sugar cookies, and the like. The present invention is further illustrated in the following Examples where all parts, ratios and percentages are by weight and all temperatures are in degrees F, unless otherwise stated This Example illustrates the preparation of a multi textured chocolate chip cookie of the invention in which the casing dough comprises a maltodextrin, lactose, dextrose and sucrose. A casing dough was prepared from the following ingredients Lo Dex 10 is a maltodextrin produced by hydrolyzing corn starch and sold commercially by American Maize Products Company, Corn Processing Division, 1100 Indianapolis Boulevard, Hammond, Indiana 46320. Lo Dex 10 is a low dextrose equivalent product which is essentially non deliquescent, bland and has a very low sweetness level. The manufacturer s data sheet quotes typical chemical and physical data as being 4.5 percent moisture content, a dextrose equivalent of 12 percent, a sulfur dioxide level of 40 parts per million, a pH in 1 1 aqueous dispersion of 4.7 and a bulk density of 30 pounds per cubic foot. The approximate carbohydrate composition is stated to be 1 percent of monosaccharides, 4 percent of disaccharides, 5 percent of trisaccharides and 90 percent of tetra or higher polysaccharides. Physically, the product is a pure white powder having a particle size distribution of 100 percent through 40 U.S. mesh and 65 percent through 200 U.S. mesh. Thirty point eight parts of the sugar, the vegetable shortening, lactose, dextrose, salt, whole egg powder and the spray oil were placed in a Hobart mixing bowl, then mixed for 1 minute at low speed and 2 minutes at high speed. The vanilla, molasses, color and water were added and the resultant mixture mixed for one minute at low speed. The flour, sodium bicarbonate and sodium acid pyrophosphate were added and the resultant mixture mixed for three minutes at low speed. The remaining sugar was added and the resultant mixture mixed for one minute at low speed. Finally, the chocolate chips were added and the resultant mixture mixed for one minute at low speed. A filler dough was prepared from the following ingredients The high fructose corn syrup used contained 70.5 to 72.5 percent by weight solids, of which 41 43 percent was fructose. The filler dough was prepared by adding the sucrose, vegetable shortening, starch, non fat dried milk, whole egg powder, salt and 46.9 parts of the flour to the Hobart mixing bowl and mixing for one minute at low speed followed by two minutes at high speed. Next, the color, ammonium bicarbonate, water and vanilla were added and the resultant mixture mixed for two minutes at low speed. The high fructose corn syrup was added and the resultant mixture mixed for two minutes at low speed. The remaining flour, sodium bicarbonate and sodium acid pyrophosphate were then added and the resultant mixture mixed for three minutes at low speed. Finally, the chocolate chips were added and the resultant mixture mixed for one minute at low speed to produce the finished filler dough. Multi textured cookies were prepared from the casing and filler doughs by enrobing 6.4 g. portions of the filler dough in 6.4 g. portions of the casing dough and baking on trays for 6 minutes at 400 F 204 C . The resultant cookies were allowed to cool on the trays for minute minute, then removed from the trays. Further batches of cookies were prepared in the same manner but using baking times of 7 and 8 minutes respectively at 400 F. The textures of the three batches of cookies thus prepared were measured using a penetration test. In this test, a probe was driven 2mm. into the upper surface of the cookie and the peak resistance to penetration measured. The probe was then allowed to remain at 2mm. penetration for two minutes and the resistance to the probe measured after this two minute period this reading is denoted 2 minute relaxation . Finally, the probe was driven to a penetration of 14mm., i.e., completely through the cookie, and the peak resistance measured. The tests were conducted on 10 cookies from each batch and the average value of each reading, the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation are given below This Example illustrates how a multi textured chocolate chip cookie of the invention could be prepared in which the casing dough would comprise a maltodextrin, lactose, and dextrose. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare the casing dough are Maltrin M100 is a maltodextrin sold commercially by Grain Processing Corporation, 1600 Oregon, Muscatine, Iowa 52761. Maltrin M100 is a low dextrose equivalent product which is bland, free flowing, and has a very low sweetness level. The manufacturer s data sheet quotes typical chemical and physical data as being 6.0 percent moisture content, a dextrose equivalent of 9.0 12.0 percent and a pH of 4.0 4.7 20 percent solution . The approximate carbohydrate composition is stated to be 1 percent of monosaccharides, 4 percent of disaccharides, 6 percent of trisaccharides, 5 percent of tetrasaccharides, and 84 percent of penta or higher polysaccharides.

Thirty five parts of the sugar, the lactose, dextrose, maltodextrin, vegetable shortening, spray oil, salt, whole egg powder, caramel color, and chocolate and vanilla flavorings are creamed together for 3 minutes at low speed in a mixing bowl. The molasses and water are then added and the resultant mixture mixed for 2 minutes at low speed. The flour, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate are then added and the resultant mixture mixed for 2 minutes at low speed. Finally the remaining sugar and chocolate chips are added and the resultant mixture mixed for one minute at low speed. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare a filler dough are The filler dough is prepared by creaming the vegetable shortening, margarine, sugar, starch, skim milk, salt, whole egg powder, cocoa, vanilla flavor and caramel color in a mixing bowl for 3 minutes at low speed. The high fructose corn syrup, honey, glycerine, ammonium bicarbonate, and water are then added, and the resultant mixture mixed at low speed for 2 minutes. Next, the flour, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium acid pyrophosphate are added and the low speed mixing continued for a further 2 minutes. Finally, the chocolate chips are added and the low speed mixing continued for a further minute to produce the finished filler dough. The cookies are prepared by enrobing 6.5g portions of filler dough in 6.5g portions of the casing dough and baking the enrobed dough pieces at 400 F 204 C for 7.5 minutes. This Example illustrates how a multi textured peanut butter chocolate chip cookie of the invention could be prepared in which the casing dough would comprise a maltodextrin, lactose, and dextrose. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare the casing dough are Twenty parts of the sugar, the lactose, dextrose maltodextrin, vegetable shortening, peanut butter and vanilla flavorings, cocoa, salt, and whole egg powder are added to a mixing bowl and creamed about 3 minutes at low speed. Then the glucose, water, and ammonium bicarbonate are added and the resultant mixture mixed for two minutes at low speed. The flour, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and chocolate liquor are then added, and the low speed mixing continued about another 2 minutes. Finally the remaining sugar and chocolate and peanut chips are added, and the low speed mixing continued for a further minute. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare a filler dough are The filler dough is prepared by creaming together the sucrose, vegetable shortening, margarine, starch, peanut butter flavor, salt, skim milk powder, and cocoa for 3 minutes at low speed in a mixing bowl. Next, the high fructose corn syrup, ammonium bicarbonate, honey, glycerine, and water are added and the resultant mixture mixed for two minutes at low speed. Then, the flour, chocolate liquor, sodium acid pyrophosphate, and sodium bicarbonate are added and the low speed mixing continued for another two minutes. Finally, the peanut butter and chocolate chips are added and the low speed mixing continued for another minute. The cookies are prepared by enrobing 6.5g portions of the filler dough in 6.5g portions of the casing dough and baking the enrobed dough pieces at 400 F 204 C for 7.5 minutes.

The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare the casing dough are To prepare the casing dough, 20 parts of the sucrose, the lactose, dextrose, maltodextrin, vegetable shortening, salt, whole egg powder, cocoa, and vanilla flavor are creamed in a mixing bowl at low speed for 3 minutes. Then, the corn syrup, water, and ammonium bicarbonate are added and the resultant mixture mixed at low speed for 2 minutes. The low speed mixing is continued for another two minutes after the addition of the flour, sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, and chocolate liquor. Finally, the chocolate chips, almonds, and remaining sucrose are added and the low speed mixing continued for a further 1 minute. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare the filler dough for the almond chocolate chip cookies are The sucrose, margarine, vegetable shortening, starch, salt, skim milk powder, and cocoa are creamed together for 3 minutes at low speed in a mixing bowl. The high fructose corn syrup, ammonium bicarbonate, honey, glycerine, and water are then added and the resultant mixture mixed together about 2 minutes at low speed. Next, the flour, chocolate liquor, sodium acid pyrophosphate, and sodium bicarbonate are added and the low speed mixing continued for another 2 minutes. Finally, the almonds and chocolate chips are added and the low speed mixing continued about another minute. The cookies are prepared by enrobing 6.5g portions of the filler dough in 6.5g portions of the casing dough and baking the enrobed dough pieces at 400 F 204 C for 7.5 minutes. This Example illustrates how a multi textured butterscotch chocolate chip cookie of the invention could be prepared in which the casing dough would comprise a maltodextrin, lactose, and dextrose. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare the casing dough are Thirty five parts of the sugar, the lactose, dextrose, maltodextrin, vegetable shortening, spray oil, salt, whole egg powder, caramel color, and vanilla flavor are added to a mixing bowl and creamed together for 3 minutes at low speed. The corn syrup, molasses, honey, and water are added and the resultant mixture mixed at low speed for 2 minutes. The low speed mixing is continued for a further 2 minutes after the addition of the flour, sodium bicarbonate, wheat gluten, and sodium acid pyrophosphate. Finally, the remaining sugar and chocolate chips are added and the low speed mixing continued for another minute. The ingredients and their relative amounts which may be used to prepare a filler dough are The filler dough is prepared by creaming together the sugar, vegetable shortening, margarine, salt, starch, skim milk powder, whole egg powder, vanilla and butterscotch flavorings, and cocoa in a mixing bowl at low speed for 3 minutes. Next, the high fructose corn syrup, honey, and water are added, and the resultant mixture mixed together at low speed for 2 minutes.
