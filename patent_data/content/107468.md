# Polyethylene terephthalate backed adhesive tape of extreme dimensional stability.

## Abstract
Adhesive tape useful in supporting an array of parallel opti cal fibers in an optical transmission cable comprising an adhesi ve covered biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film having defined ranges for the proportion of gauche and trans conformations of the ethylene glycol linkages of the polyethyl ene terephthalate molecule, as measured by infrared spectros copy, whereby extreme dimensional stability is achieved.
