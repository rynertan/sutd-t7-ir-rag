# CLAMP FOR DUPLICATING MACHINES FOR LOCK KEYS

## Abstract
A clamp for duplicating machines for lock keys compris ing a pair of jaws 1,1 ,2,2 which are mounted on a threaded pin 4 rigid with a clamp support carriage 3 , means for ap proaching said two jaws 1,1 ,2,2 when clamping the key, and elastic means 8, 6 interposed between said two jaws 1, 1 ,2,2 to keep them spaced apart. The clamp comprises, in a position misaligned with the line of action of the applied clamp ing force and at the opposite side with repect to the gripping faces of the jaws 1,1 ,2,2 , a projecting portion causing, during the clamping stage, a moment opposite to the reaction moment caused by the clamped key.
