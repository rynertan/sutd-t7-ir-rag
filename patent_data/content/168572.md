# PNEUMATIC INTEGRAL POLYGONAL SUSPENSION FOR VIBRATING TAMPING MACHINES

## Abstract
The pneumatic suspension device according to the novel and improved principle of this invention, suitable for transmitting torque, is composed of a single toroid shaped vibration damping pneumatic ring, the inner surface of which rests on a rim connected to the part of the machine which must be free from vibration for exemple, a hydraulic engine 12 directly flanged on the reduction unit 13 , both of which are made integral with the bracket 9 and frame 8 , whereas the outer surface of the pneumatic ring 9 is gripped by a series of S shaped jaw elements 3, 3 , bolted onto a support ring 4 welded to the inner cylindrical wall of the vibrating drum 5 , said S shaped jaw elements 3, 3 having a profile such that each pair 3, 3 of jaws, once fixed in position on said outer band of the toroidal pneumatic ring, forms therewith a single body damping the vibration of the drum 5 .
