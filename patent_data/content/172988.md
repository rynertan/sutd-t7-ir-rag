# Optical fibers for infrared transmission.

## Abstract
An optical fiber which is able to transmit high power infrared energy, and is flexible and long in life is described. The fiber consists essentially of a mixed crystal of 40 to 45 wt of thallium bromide and the balance of thallium iodide, each having a purity not less than 99.9 . The fiber is free of any particles having a size not smaller than 1 Âµm.
