# Method, system and apparatus for cutting profiles from natural leaves.

## Abstract
There is provided a method, system and apparatus for cutting a profile, such as a cigar wrapper, from a natural leaf, such as a tobacco leaf, wherein the leaf is spread and supported on a support surface in a random position 40 . Thereafter, a leaf facsimile or image, including the leaf outline and surface imperfections, is developed 70 and at least one cut position for the wrapper is located in an area excluding the leaf outline and surface imperfections 80 . This cut position is recorded and converted to digital data 100 . The wrapper is then cut from the leaf at an actual cut position corresponding to the located cut position determined by the digital data 104 . Also, the facsimile is created by a back lighting arrangement which illuminates color variations and surface imperfections, as well as the leaf outline, so that leaf colour variations can be included in the facsimile or image.
