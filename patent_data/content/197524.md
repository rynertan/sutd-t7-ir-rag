# CURABLE EPOXY ACRYLAMIDE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A curable composition is made up of a curing compo nent and a curable component. The curable component contains at least one vinyl polymerizable amide group containing material and an epoxide group containing mate rial and is particularly useful as adhesive for the preparation of bonding structures such as structural components of transportation vehicles.
