# Eddy current inspection apparatus and probe.

## Abstract
An eddy current inspection probe includes a bobbin 22 housing a central ferrite rod 24 . Two coils 26, 28 are wound around one end of the ferrite rod 24 . The coils 26, 28 form two legs of a bridge circuit driven at 1.5 to 2.0 MHz. Defects are located by detecting phase shift in the bridge output.
