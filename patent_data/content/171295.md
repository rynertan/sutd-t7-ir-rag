# Weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A weighing apparatus for weighing elongate articles such as spaghetti strings or macaroni tubes, for example, includes a primary weighing machine 1 for measuring the weight of articles within a preset target weight, a plurality of secondary weighing machines 2 for measuring a weight shortage with respect to the preset target weight which is the difference between the preset target weight and the weight measured by the primary weighing machine, a control unit 16 for effecting a combinatorial weighing operation on the weights from the secondary weighing machines with the shortage employed as a combinatorial target weight to select one weight combination which is equal to the combinatorial target weight or closest thereto within an allowable range, and a combining unit such as a packaging machine 10 for combining articles discharged from the primary weighing machine and those secondary weighing machines which give the weight combination. In this way, the weighing ap paratus can automatically weigh the elongate articles highly efficiently and can be made smaller in size than prior art apparatus. A primary supply device may include a pair of primary weighing machines, and a secondary supply device may include a plurality of pairs of secondary weighing machines.
