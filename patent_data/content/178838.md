# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING LENGTHS OF PIPE

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing lengths of pipe adapted to be interconnected to form a pipeline comprises the steps of providing lengths of tubing 2 and integrally forming correspondingly shaped male and female connecting pieces 18,12 at the opposed ends of each length of tubing. The female connecting piece has an external screw thread 16 formed thereon, while a nut 24 having an internal screw thread 26 corresponding with the external screw thread on the female connecting pipe 12 is located on each length of tubing 2 . Abutment means 28,32 are provided on the nut 24 and on the male connecting piece 18 such that, on location of the male connecting piece 18 of one length of pipe in the female connecting piece 12 of another length of pipe, the nut 24 on the one length can be screwed onto the female connecting piece 12 of the other length to effect a connection between the two lengths of pipe.
