## Description
POLYURETHANE OLY 5ER POLYOLS rADE WITH .ROMATWC NITROGEN CONTAINING POLYOLS AND POLYURETH NES THEREFORM The invention relates to the field of polyurethane plastics, and more particularly relates to polyurethne plastics made using polvurethane.poltmer polvols. The use of a polyol in the preparation of poly urethanes, by reaction of the polyol with a polyisocyan ate in the presence of a catalyst and optionally other ingredients, is well known. Conventional polyols for flexible polyurethane foams are usuall made by the reaction of a polyhydric alcohol with an alkylene oxide, usually ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide, to a molecular weight of 2,000 to 3,000 and above. These polyols are then reacted with polyisocyanate in the presence of water, or other blowing agents such as fluorocarbons, to obtain polyurethane foams. Polyols have been modified in many ways in attempts to improve the properties of the resulting polyurethane. For example, elastomeric polytetramethylene ether polyurethane polymers may be made from reactions involving a polvmethylene ether glycol having a molecular weight of at least 750, an organic diisocyanate and a chain extender containing active hydrogen according to U S. A 2 929 800.The glycol may be added to the diisocyanate to form a prepolymer. U.S. S 3 294 751 relates to the preparation of polyurethanes via a modified polyol called a ureidopolyol. These low molecular weight ureido polyols are formed by the reaction of an organic compound having a hydrocarbon group having less than 10 carbon atoms and at least one isocyanate group and an alkanolaine. Further, the invention disclosed in U.S. S 4 118 376 concerns a hvdrocurable composition suitable for use as coatings, adhesives or qrouts.The composition contains oxazolidine compounds and tree isocyanate group containing prepolymers, where the prepolotmers are obtained by the reaction of polyisocyanates with special types of disper sions where the dispersed phase is syn.hesized in situ in a dispersing medium comprising a polyhydroxyl compound. Other prior art describes modified polyols in which vinyl monomers, such as styrene or acrylonitrile, or other materials such as hydrazine hydrate, have been included to improve the properties of the polyol, and thus the properties of the resulting foam. Some of these prior art materials are, however, highly toxic ad require, in addition, stripping of reacted vinyl monomers or water of hydration. U.S. A 4 107 102 describes the manufacture of polyurethane foam using a polyol containing hydrazine or its abducts. DE A 2 110 055 discloses a process or making polyurethane product wherein a hydro yl containing amine is included in the formulation for a one shot process.That is, the hydroxyl containing amine is simply included initially with the polyol and the polyisocyanate and polyurethane product results. Such a process oes not use a polyurea polymer polyol for reaction with a polylsocyan ate. Our invention makes polyurethane foams improved over the products of DE A 2 110 055,as will be made clear by the disclosure and the examples which follow. U.S. A 3 325 421 discloses a method of making a stable dispersion of a urea in a composition comprising an organic polyisocyanate, a diamine and a compound having at least two alcoholic hydroxyl groups. A polymer modified polol may be formed b polymerizing an alkanolamine with an organic polyisocyanate in the presence of a polyol, as taught in GB A. 2 072 204.The alkanolamine may react polyfunctionally with the polyisocyanate to produce polyaddition products, which may constitute a stable dispersion in the polyol. The resulting modified polyol is stated to be particularly useful as a polyol starting material for reaction with a polyisocyanate in the manufacture of polyurethane foam. Stabile dispersions are also revealed in U.S. E 4 OP,9 835. Here, the stable dispersions comprise polyureas and or polyhydrazo dicarbonarr ides as the disperse phase in a hydroxvl group containing material selected from polyethers, polyesters, polyester amides and polycarbonates. These dispersions may be produced by reacting organic polyisocyanates with polyamines containing primary and or secondary amino groups and or hydrazines and or hydrazides in the hydroxyl containing material. Highly related is our own U.S. A 4 296 213 which relates to polyurea polymer polyols made by the reaction of a hydroxyl containing amine, a polyether polyol of 3,000 to 8,000 molecular weight and an organic polyisocyanate. The hydroxyl containing amines are described therein as having a molecular weight from 60 to 200, preferably from 60 to 150. It was not realized that higher molecular weight, hydroxyl containing amines, which also contain aromatic groups, would also give a polymer polyol which would impart enhanced properties to flexible urethane foams. The present invention concerns a polyurethane polymer polyol made by the reaction of an aromatic nitrogen containing polyol, a polyether polyol and an organic polyisocyanate, wherein the mole ratio of aromatic nitrogen containing polyol to polyether polyol is from 0.5 1 to 3.5 1, and the mole ratio of total hydroxyl groups to isocyanate groups is from 1.5 1 two 3.0 1. This invention also relates to polyurethanes made from such polyurethane polymer polyols. The polyurethane polymer polyols of this invention are made by the reaction of an aromatic nitrogen containing polyol, a polyether polyol and an organic polvisocvanate.While these polyols are sometimes referred to in the singular as a polyurethane polymer polyol, it must be remembered that the reaction product is actually a mixture of slightly different polymer polyols. The aromatic nitrogen containing polyol may be any such polyol made by the methods described in U.S. A 3 297 597 and 4 137 265. Generally, the procedure beo ns by mixing a phenol and an alkanolamine having the formula EMI4.1 where R is hydrogen or alkyl having 1 to z carbon atoms, R is hydrogen, alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or CHR n OH, and n is a positive integer from 2 to 5.Subsequently, formaldehyde is added and the mixture is heated to reduce the formaldehyde content. Water is stripped off to produce the tannic condensate which is further reacted with an alkvlene oxide, preferably e.hrl ene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide de, glycidol or a mixture thereof. Preferably, the aromatic nitrogen containing polvol is made by reacting two to five moles o ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with one mole of the Mannich reaction product of a mole of phenol or nonylphenol with one or two moles of diethanolamine. Such polls are sold cor.merc ially as THANOL R 350 X and THANOL R 650 X polyols byTexaco Chemical Company. It is especially preferred that the molecular weight of the aromatic, nitrogen containing polyol be from 300 to 800. The polyether polyol which is used preferably has a hydroxyl number between 20 and 60. The polyol is aener ally an alkylene oxide adduct of a polyhydric alcohol, preferably a trihydric alcohol, with a unctionality of from 2 to 4. The alkylene oxide may suitably be ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or 1,2 butylene oxide or a mixture of son or all of these. The polyol will preferably have a molecular weight of from 2,000 to 10,000 and more preferably, from 3,000 to 8,000. The alkvlene oxide is pref erably propylene oxide or a mixture of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide.This definition does not include olyether poryoZs which contain aromatic or amine groups. The ratio of moles of hydroxyl containing amine to moles of polyether polyol should be from 0.5 1 to 3.5 1, and preferably from 0.7 1 to 2.8 1. The polyisocyanate used herein may be any aromatic or aliphatic polyisocyanate. Typical aromatic polyisocyanates include m phenylene diisocyanate, P phenylene diisocyanate, polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates, 2,4 toluene diisocyanate, 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, bitolylene diisocyanate, naphthalene 1,4 diisocyanate, xylylene 1,4 diisocyanate, xylylene 1,3 diisocyanate, bis 4 isocyanatophenyl methane, bis 3 methyl 4 isocyanatophenyl methane, and 4,41 diphenylpropane diisocyanate, and mixtures thereof. Greatly preferred aromatic polyisocyanates used in the practice of the invention are 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanates and methylene bridged polyphenyl polyisocyanate mixtures which have a functionality of from 2 to 4. These latter isocyanate compounds are generally pro ducked by the phosgenation of corresponding methylenebridged polyphenyl polyamines, which are conventionally produced by the reaction of formaldehyde and primary aromatic amines, such as aniline, in the presence of hydrochloric acid and or other acidic catalysts. Known processes for preparing polyamines and corresponding methylene bridged polyphenyl polyisocyanates therefrom are described in the literature and in many patents for exam ple, U.S. A 2 683 730 2 950 263 3 012 008 3 344 162 and 3 362 979. The most preferred methvlene bridged polyphenyl polyisocyanate mixtures used herein contain 20 to 100 weight z of methylene diphenyldiisocyanate isomers, with any remainder being polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates having higher functionalities and higher molecular weights. Typical of these are polyphenyl polyisocyanate mixtures containing 20 to 100 weight e of methylene diphenyldiisocyanate isomers, of which 20 to 95 weight t is the 4 4 5 sorer, with the rew,anncer beir.g polymethylene polyisocyanates of hither molecular weight and an average functionality of from 2.1 to 3.5.These isocrran2.te mixtures are knou.m, corrinercially available, materials and can be prepared by the process described. in U.S. A 3 362 979. Since the polyurethane polymer polyol has by defin ition free hydroxyl groups, the amount of polyisocyanate used to form the polyurethane polymer polyol is less than the stoichiometric amount needed to satisfy the active hydrogens of the hydroxyl groups of the polyether polyol, the hydroxyl containing amine and the active amine hydrogens. Therefore, the ratio of moles of hydroxyl groups from both the polyether polyol and nitrogen containing polyol to moles of isocyanate groups should be from 1.5 to 3.0. Preferably, the hydroxyl number or these polyurethane polymer polyols should be from 40 to 75. It should be noted that the polymer er polyols used according to this invention are quite different from the quasi orepolymers made for rigid foam uses that are cescri bed in U.S. A 3 297 597 and 4 137 265. According to those patents, the quasi prepolymer is formed by reacting a large molar excess of isocyanate to polyol, in contrast to the excess of polyol to isocyanate employed according to the present invention. The polyether polyol, aromatic, nitrogen containing polyol and polyisocyanate can be successfully reacted without application of external heat, and at atmospheric pressure, although higher temperatures and pressures would also be acceptable. The reaction temperature could be between 25 and 100 C. The polyurethane polymer polyol prepared from the above ingredients is then incorporated into a tormula.ion which results in a polyurethane product. The polyurethane polymer polyol may be used in conjunction with a polyisocyanate, such as those mentioned above, or may be com bined with additional polyol, such as those mentioned sove and others, and reacted with a polyisocxwanate to iorm a resulting polyurethane foam product. The advantage of the foam forming method of this invention, using the polyurethane polymer polyols described herein, is that flexible urethane foams can be pro duced which are firmer and stronger than similar products made using conventional polyols. The polyurethane polymer polyols of this invention may also be blended with conventional polyols to enhance the properties of the resulting foams beyond that possible with the conventional polyols alone. In order to form the polyurethane foam, a catalyst useful in preparing foams of this tvpe is employed. in the usual manner. Such catalysts may include one or more of the following a Tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, tri ethyl amine, N methylmorpholine, N ethylmorpholine, N,N dimethylbenzylamine, N,N dimethylethanolamine, N,N,N N tetramethyl 1,3 butanediamine, N ,N dimethylpiperazine, and 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane b Tertiary phosphines, such as trialkvlphos phines, and dialkylbenzylphosphines c Strong bases such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkoxides, and phenoxides d Acidic metal salts of strong acids such as ferric chloride, stannic chloride, stannous chloride, antimony trichloride, bismuth nitrate and chloride e Chelates of various metals, such as those which can be obtained from acetylacetone, benzoylacetone, trifluoroacetyl acetone, ethyl acetoacetate, salicyaldehyde, cyclopentanone l carboxylate, acetylacetoneimine, bisacetylacetonealkylenediamines, and sali cycl aldehydeimine, with such metals as Be, Mg, Zn, Cd, Pd, Ti, Zr, Sn, As,Bi, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni f Alcoholates and phenolates of various metals such as Ti OR 4,, Sn OR 4,, and A1 OR 3,, wherein R is alkyl or aryl, and the reaction products of alcoholates with carboxylic acids, beta diketones, and 2 N,N dialkyl amino alk,9nol s g Salts of organic acids with a variety of metals such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, A1, Sn, Pb, tffi, Co, Ni, and Cu including, for example, sodium acetate, stannous octoate, stannous oleate, lead octoate, metallic driers such as manganese and cobalt naphthenate and h Organometallic derivatives of tetravalent tin, trivalent and. pentavalent As, Sb, or Bi, and carbonyls of iron or cobalt. Of course combinations of any of the above polyurethane catalysts may be employed. Usually the amount of catalyst employed is from 0.01 to 5.0 weight , based on polyol. More often the amount of catalyst used is 0.2 to 2.0 weight , Foaming is carried out in the presence of water and, optionally, additional organic blowing agents. The water is normally used in amounts of 0.5 to 15 by weight, preferably, 1.0 to 10 by weight based. on the polyurethane polymer polyol and any additional polaol present. The organic blowing agents, that optionally be used with the water, are tnown in the art and include, for example, monofluorotrichloromethane, difluorodichloromethane, methylene dichloride and others generally known in the art. Additives to regulate the cell size and the cell structure, for example, silicone oils such as dimethylpolysiloxanes, mav also be added to the foaming mixture.Fillers, flame retarding additives, dyes or plasticizers of known types may also be used. These and other additives are well known to those skilled in the art. The invention and its improvement over the art will now be illustrated with the aid of the following nonlimiting Examples.
