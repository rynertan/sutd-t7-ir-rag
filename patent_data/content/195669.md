# Process for preparing hydrated alumina.

## Abstract
A process for preparing hydrated alumina consisting essentially of spherical particles having a narrow granulo metric distribution polydispersion index dw dn less than or equal to 2 starting from aqueous solution of aluminium sulphate, the molar ration SO₄ Al³ being greater than 1, by homogeneous precipitation in the presence of a cationic polyelectrolyte, soluble under the reaction conditions and having a mean molecular weight greater than one million and a ionicity, deriving from the cationic groups present in the polyelectrolyte, of at least 3 milliequivalents gram, the precipitation being carried out in the presence of at least one substance capable of releasing OH ions under the reaction conditions.
