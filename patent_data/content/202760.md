The papillary muscle was loaded with the weight of about 1.5 grams, and the tension developed by the papillary muscle was measured by a strain gauge transducer. The blood flow through the anterior septal artery was measured by an electromagnetic flow meter. The developed tension and the blood flow were recorded on charts with an ink writing recorder. The details of this test method was reported in an article written by Endoh and Hashimoto American Journal of Physiology, Vol. 218, pp. 1459 1463 1970 . The test compound was intraarterially admini stered in the amount of 10 30 microliters in 4 seonds. The inotropic effects of the test compounds were expressed as a percentage of the developed tension before the intraarterially administration of the test compound. The effect of the test compound on the blood flow were expressed as a difference milliliter minute of the values before and after the intraarterially admini stration of the test compound. The test results are shown in the following Tables 4 and 5. In Table 5, the test results are shown as the ratios of the data obtained from the test compounds to the data obtained from Amrinone 3 amino 5 4 pyridinyl 2 1H pyridinone used as a reference compound.
