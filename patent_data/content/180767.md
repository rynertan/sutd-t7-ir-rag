# Optical lens device.

## Abstract
In the present invention, a micro Fresnel lens 52 in the shape of a thin film is used. A lens driving member constructed of piezoelectric transducers 54, 56 or of magnets and coils is disposed around the lens 52 . The focus of the lens 52 is adjusted by controlling applied voltage to the piezoelectric transducers 54, 56 or the coils.
