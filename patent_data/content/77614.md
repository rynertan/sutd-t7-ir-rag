# ALKALINE ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS

## Abstract
In an alkaline electrochemical cell, particularly a button cell, having a cathode that includes a reducible oxide, e.g. divalent silver oxide or Î² manganese dioxide, an alkaline metal borohydride, a quaternary ammonium borohydride, a complex aluminium hydride or hydrazine is dissolved in or made available to the electrolyte on cell closure to reduce the oxide and avoid discharge at two voltage plateaus.
