## Description
POLY HALOSTYRENE FOR NEGATIVE RESISTSThis invention relates generally to the preparation of negative electron beam resists for photomask fabrication and or semiconductor device fabrication and more particularly to poly halostyrene , useful in the preparation of said negative resists.Briefly, a resist is an adhering layer of a material with patterned openings on a substrate which is used as a mask for etching, either partially or completely through, whereby the substrate is being exposed by the openings in the resist. Generally, resists are categorized as positive or negative.The formation of positive resist masks from layers of radiation degradable polymers is described, for example, in U.S. Patent No.3,535,137. In this process, a radiation degradable polymer layer is coated on a substrate and is subjected to patternwise exposure to high energy radiation such as, for example, X rays, deep W , nuclear radiation or electrons. The irradiated regions of the polymer suffer a decrease in molecular weight and thereby become more rapidly soluble. A developer is then used to preferentially remove the irradiated portions of the layer. The substrate is then subjected to an additive or substractive process such as metallization or etching with the remaining portions of the resist layer acting to protect the substrate from the processing.Alternatively, a negative resist mask is formed by coating a crosslinkable polymer on a substrate. The polymer is generally applied as a solution in a suitable solvent to the substrate and allowed to dry as a thin film. High energy radiation, such as an electron beam, short wave length UV light, or X rays, is permitted to irradiate the surface of the polymer in the desired pattern to form a negative resist by imparting sufficient energy to cross link the polymer. Cross linking causes the irradiated portion to be insoluble in certain solvents. After irradiation is completed, the resist is subjected to a solvent and the non irradiated portion of the resist is removed, thereby leaving openings in the resist that correspond to the desired pattern. The present invention relates to negative resists.Prior art negative resist materials have several shortcomings, among which is the difficulty in obtaining sharp images of high resolution.Moreover, deep Uv lithography using the wavelength range from 2000 to 3500 A is receiving considerable attention as a possible economic mass production method of manufacturing ultra fine patterns about lssm for making VLSI. As these deep Uv tools become available, much emphasis is being placed on finding compatible negative resist materials with high resolution, high contrast and plasma resistance.Recently, polystyrenes have been receiving renewed attention as electron and X ray resists, primarily since it has been shown by others that very high contrast can be obtained with high molecular weight polystyrene exposed to electron beams at doses in the range of 10 coul cm2 100 ij 2 coul cm . It has also been shown that the sensitivity of polystyrenes can be considerably improved by physical doping with cross linking agents and sensitizers or by incorporating such elements as chlorine, bromine or iodine in the polymer chain. In this regard, see, for example J.C. Jagt and A.P.G. Sevriens, Photopolymers Principles Processes and Materials, SPE, Ellenville, NY, p. 152 1979 T. Tsunoda, et al., Phot. Sci. Engr., 17 4 , 390 1973 N.A. Weir andT. H. Milkie, J. Poly. Sci. Chem , 17, 3735 1979 W. Burlant, et al., J. Poly Sci., 58, 491 1962 E. D. Reit, Photopolymers Principles Processes and Materials, SPE, Ellenville, NY, p. 91 1979 and H.Shiraishi, et al., Photopolymers Principles Processes and Materials,SPE, Ellenville, NY, p. 56 1979 . However, this literature illustrates that even though the sensitivity of the polystyrenes was increased in 2 the 10 coul cm range, residues and swelling of the exposed pattern are always experienced when trying to develop a high resolution pattern in a relatively thick resist layer lem . The invention provides a new class of negative deep Uv resist materials which are highly sensitive and plasma resistant. The negative resist materials are highly sensitive in the deep nv region, particularly between 2000 and 2600A, forming high contrast negative images that are reactive ion etch RIE resistant. The negative resists of the present invention allow high contrast and resolution to be obtained on electron beam exposure leaving no residue in the unexposed region and minimum swelling of the exposed region.According to the invention there is provided a poly halostyrene having the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, n represents a number in the range of from about 750 to about 7,500, the molecular weight Mw of the polymers being in the range of from 1 x 10 to 1 x 106 and the dispersivityEMI3.2 of the polymers being in the range of from 1.5 to 2.5.The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a graphical illustration of the optical absorption of a poly 4 chlorostyrene resist lWm thick of the present invention at varied wavelengths Fig. 2.1 illustrates the contrast curves for poly 4 chlorostyrene resists of about MW 700,000 curve A and about MW 250,000 curve B , useful in the present invention Fig. 2.2 shows scanning electron micrographs of electron beam irradiated poly 4 chlorostyrene resists in accordance with the present invention Fig. 3 shows scanning electron micrographs illustrating the thermal stability of electron beam exposed poly 4 chlorostyrene resists of the present invention and the almost complete elimination of resist residue by postbaking Fig. 4 is a series of scanning electron micrographs illustrating the excellent resolution obtained with electron beam exposed poly 4 chlorostyrene resists of the present invention minimum line 0.4 pm and minimum space 0.4 ssm Fig 5.1 shows scanning electron micrographs illustrating the sharp line profiles obtained on deep Uv exposure of poly 4 chlorostyrene resists of the present invention andFig. 5.2 shows scanning electron micrographs illustrating the narrow patterns obtained on X ray exposure of poly 4 chlorostyrene resists of the present invention. The present invention involves the use of a new class of poly halogenatqd styrene , as negative electron beam, X ray or U.V. resist materials. This new class of poly halo styrenes allows high contrast and high resolution images to be obtained at electron beam exposures of, 6 2 for example, 1 5 x 10 cou V cm , depending on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the polymer, leaving almost no residue in the unexposed region and minimum swelling of the exposed image even at thicknesses above lssm. More specifically, the polymeric compositions which are employed in preparing the resists of the present invention comprise poly halogenated styrenes having the following general formula EMI5.1 wherein n is a number in the range of from about 750 to about 7,500, X is halogen, such as Cl, Br or I, and wherein the molecular weight distribution of the polymers in the composition results in a dispersivityEMI5.2 of from 1.5 to 2. 5. The poly halogenated styrene compositions of the present invention generally have a molecular weight bow of from about 1 x 10 to about 1 x 106. Representative halogenated polystyrenes included in the above formula, are, for example, poly 4 chlorostyrene , poly 4 bromostyrene and poly 4 iodostyrene . Of these, the most preferred for the purposes of this invention is poly 4 chlorostyrene . Preferably, the polymers of the present invention have a molecular weight in the range of from about 250,000 to about 700,000 and a dispersivity in the range of from about 1.7 to about 2.2 and most preferably about 2.In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that the hereinbefore identified poly halogenated styrenes must be prepared by free radical solution polymerization of the monomer in order to achieve the negative resist characteristics desired herein. In contrast to preparing the halogenated polystyrene polymers by bulk polymerization, solution polymerization is believed to result in forming less branching. Branching is deleterious since it may cause swelling of the cross linked portions on development. Moreover, in the preparation of the poly halostyrenes herein, it has been found advantageous to carry out the solution polymerization at a slow rate and at a low temperature. These conditions are believed to result in less head to head linkages, which are weak polymer links and which would readily break down on irradiation. More particularly, using para chlorostyrene monomer for exemplification purposes, the preparation of the new class of negative resist polymers herein involves initially purifying the chlorostyrene monomer, e.g. by fractional distillation, to remove deleterious impurities. Since it is usually customary to add polymerization inhibitors, such as 3,5 di tertbutyl catechol, to monomeric materials to prevent polymerization during storage, these inhibitors must be removed. Column chromatography, for example, using activated alumina, is one method which can be used for this purpose.Degassing of the monomer, to remove dissolved air 02, for example, by freeze thawing under vacuum in liquid nitrogen has also been found advantageous since the presence of small amounts of oxygen in the monomer may result in oxygen being present in the backbone of the polymer, which also causes undesirable weak linkages in the chain.The monomer is then ready to be slowly solution polymerized in accordance with the present invention. Specifically, the monomer is diluted with Åa low chain transfer coefficient solvent, such as for example, cholorbenzene, flurobenzene, perflurobenzene and the like and permitted to polymerize at, for example, a temperature of 600C 100 C, for a time of, for example, from about two hours to about one month.The time for polymerization is dependent upon several factors including temperature and or the presence of a polymerization initiator. For instance, to obtain satisfactory polymer for the purposes of this invention, in the absence of an initiator and at temperatures of about 65 C, the polymerization is permitted to proceed for about one month.On the other hand, higher temperatures e.g. 100 C and the presence of initiator, e.g. azo compounds, such as l,l1 bis aziosobutyronitrile, the polymerization may be terminated in about two hours.Other initiators, which may be utilized in the solution polymerization contemplated herein, include, for example, organic peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide, tert butyl hydroperoxide, hydrogen perioxide, and peracetic acid. Generally, if used, the initiator is employed at levels of from about 0.05 to about 0.20 mole . After the polymerization reaction is terminated, the reaction solution is fractionated, via differential solubility of molecular weights in various solvent mixtures, to remove undesired low molecular weight polymer and to isolate the polymeric fraction having a molecular weight of from about 1 x 10 to 1 x 106 and a dispersivity of from about 1.5 to about 2.5. Solvents useful for fractionation of this sort include, for example, methyl ethyl ketone and methanol.In forming the negative resist, the halogenated polystyrene is generally applied as a solution, such as, for example, in cyclohexanone, to a substrate, such as, for example, a silicon wafer and spin coated. To obtain the desired thickness on the support, the spin coating is usually carried out at from about 1,000 RPM to about 10,000 RPM. The coated substrate is prebaked for example at 160 C i 50C for about 15 minutes.Then an electron beam or other source of irradiation is caused to sweep or flood the surface of the polymer on the substrate in the desired pattern to form a negative resist by imparting sufficient energy to cross link the polymer, thereby making the irradiated portions insoluble in certain solvents. Exposure dosages for the purposes of this invention are generally in the range of from about 1 to about 5 ijc ctr2 with electron beams, depending on the molecular weight and MWD of the polymer. With ultraviolet light us , the dosage is in the range of 2 about 20 60 mJ cm at wavelengths from 200 260 nm. Also, with X ray irradiation at 8 12 angstroms wavelength, a dose of 20 60 mJ cm2 is required. After the electron beam, UV or X ray exposure is completed, the resist is subjected to a solvent, such as methylisobutyl ketone, 2 ethoxyethanol and the like and mixtures thereof and the non irradiated portion of the resist is removed, thereby leaving openings in the resist that correspond to the desired pattern. If this pattern is to be RIE etched, the resist shows superior resistance due to the fact that it etches at 508 of the rate of PMMA in CF4, H2 2 and CF4 10 H2 RIE plasmas.In order that those skilled in the art may better understand how to practice the present invention, the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. EXAMPLE 1Inhibitor 3,5 di tert butyl cathecol is removed from 4 chlorostyrene by adsorption on an activated alumina column. To a round bottom flask is added 192 ml of monomer and 350 ml of chlorobenzene about 1 2 molar and 0.22g of benzoyl peroxide 0.1 wt . The solution is degassed by bubbling N2 with stirring for two days. The flask is then heated to 650C f 0.5 C with stirring, under N2 for 6 days 144 hrs . After precipitation, polymer yield is 140g 60 , Mn 115,000, Mw 430,000,D 3.75.Fractionation is effected as follows Add 100g of the poly 4chlorostyrene to 1000 ml methyl ethyl ketone. After dissolution, add dropwise w vigorous stirring 250 ml methanol. Stir for 2 hours after addition. Separate and precipitate the resultant two layers.Low fraction Mn 46,000, Mw 102,000, D 2.2High fraction Mn 138,000, Mw 275,000, D 2.0The high fraction is especially useful as a negative resist in accordance with the present invention. EXAMPLE 2Procedure is similar to Example 1 with the following variations. The flask contains 110 ml of 4 chlorostyrene, 200 ml chlorobenzene, and no initiator. The temperature and degas conditions are the same. Time for polymerization is 26 days. Polymer yield is 80g X65 , Mn 208,000,Mw 500,000, D 2.4.Two fractionations are performed as per Example 1 the highest fraction is saved. Poly 4 chlorostyrene is maintained as a 10 solution in MEK, with the following MeOH MEK ratios fraction 1 0.25 fraction 2 0.22. The highest fraction 2 , Mn 390,000R, Mw 680,000K, D 1.75 is especially useful as a negative resist in accordance with the present invention. EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of Negative E beam UV X Ray Resist Poly 4 chlorostyrene , high fraction , prepared in accordance withExample 1, is dissolved in cyclohexanone to produce an 11 solution. A silicon wafer treated with a drop of hexamethyldichlorosilane is spin coated at about 5000 RPM with the 118 polymer solution to obtain about o 7000A thick film after bake. The coated silicon support is prebaked at 1600C 50C for 15 minutes and exposed to an electron beam at a base 2 dose of 5 coul cm . The resist is developed by dipping the irradiated coated support in a solution of 4 parts methylisobutyl ketone MIBK to 3 parts 2 ethoxyethanol for at least 3 minutes, then dipping in 2 ethoxyethanol, without allowing to dry for 30 seconds and then spraying with 2 ethoxyethanol for 5 seconds. The so treated wafer is then blow dried with nitrogen gas, and the resist pattern is ready for further processing. If hardening is desired, the wafer is exposed to a deep Uv source low pressure mercury lamp , prior to the next processing step, for 3 5 minutes and is posthaked at 160 200 C.
