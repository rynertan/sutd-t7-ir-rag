## Description
This invention relates to a method of producing an aluminium boride. The term aluminium boride as used herein is to be understood as including both aluminium diboride AlB₂ and aluminium dodecaboride AlB₁₂ , both of which are potentially useful precursors for production by reaction sintering of refractory composites containing titanium diboride TiB₂ . Examples of reactions based on AlB₂ and AlB₁₂ which have been reported include the following However, efforts to develop a commercially viable method for manufacture of TiB₂ containing materials based on reactions such as the above are handicapped by the restricted commercial availability and consequent high price of AlB₂ and AlB₁₂. The proposed method of the present invention is intended to produce these materials at lower cost using commercially available raw materials and, as far as possible, production processes in common industrial use. GB A 1,192,677 describes a method of preparing aluminium diboride flakes and which comprises adding up to 5 of a boron source to a bath of molten aluminium. The bath is maintained at an elevated temperature, not exceeding 975 C, for a time sufficient to permit solubilization of the boron source and crystallization of the aluminium diboride flakes. The flakes may be recovered by, for example, filtering the melt through a perforated graphite plate. This disclosure is concerned solely with the production of aluminium diboride in flake form and there is no suggestion to remove the filter medium by selective chemical attack. According to one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of producing an aluminium boride in solid form, which method comprises providing a body of molten aluminium containing suspended particles of an aluminium boride, passing the body of molten aluminium through a filter which is pervious to the molten aluminium but which retains the suspended particles, the filter medium being alumina in the form of a plate or compact of pressed unbonded or lightly sintered refractory aggregate, or a bed of loose granular aggregate supported on a refractory alumina grill, and recovering the aluminium boride in solid form from the filter by dissolving the alumina filter medium in acid under conditions in which the aluminium boride is insoluble. According to a second embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of producing an aluminium boride in solid form, which method comprises providing a body of molten aluminium containing suspended particles of an aluminium boride, passing the body of molten aluminium through a filter which is pervious to the molten aluminium but which retains the suspended particles, the filter medium being carbon in the form of a plate or compact of pressed unbonded or lightly sintered refractory aggregate, or a bed of loose granular aggregate supported on a refractory alumina grill, and recovering the aluminium boride in solid form from the filter by converting the carbon filter medium to methane. Aluminium boron alloys are commercially available, and can simply be heated to provide the desired starting body of molten aluminium containing suspended particles of an aluminium boride. The industrial process for manufacturing aluminium boron alloys uses a coreless induction furnace, mains frequency being preferred. A predetermined quantity of potassium borofluoride KBF₄ powder is fed via a screw feeder or other suitable device on to the surface of the molten Al whilst supplying power to the induction coils to stir the melt. Boron B contents of commercial alloys are usually either nominally 3 or 4 and B recovery from KBF₄ is typically between 80 and 90 . The temperature of the Al determines whether the boride is produced as AlB₂, which is the low temperature phase, or AlB₁₂. The transition temperature from AlB₂ to AlB₁₂ as reported in the literature used to be somewhat uncertain, e.g. Mondolfo has reported approximately 1200 K 927 C whereas Willey ASTM Metals Handbook, 1973 reported approximately 1350 C. The experience of master alloy manufacturers indicates the latter to be too high. AlB₂ containing alloys are produced at temperatures within the range 750 850 C, typically 800 850 C. AlB₁₂ containing alloys are produced at 950 1200 C, typically 1000 1100 C. Microstructural examination of the cast materials indicates that such alloys do not contain borides exclusively as AlB₂ or AlB₁₂ but predominantly so, i.e. 90 or more of borides are in one or other form. Particle size is typically within the range 5 50 microns, with some particles up to 100 microns. The higher the B content the more difficult it becomes to produce a molten castable alloy at the low temperatures suitable for AlB₂ production, because of the rapid increase in melt viscosity. Until relatively recently no alloy containing 4 B was produced with a predominantly AlB₂ structure, but such an alloy is now commercially available. The maximum B content which could be introduced into aluminium, whilst still maintaining adequate fluidity even at the high temperatures quoted above with a predominantly AlB₁₂ structure is probably no more than 5 or 6 . After alloying is completed the furnace is slightly tilted to pour off a molten potassium aluminium fluoride reaction product. European Patent Specification 99948 A describes a method of separating high purity aluminium, by deposition on a rotating cooling body, from a melt of aluminium containing aluminium boride. The remaining melt contains an enhanced concentration of aluminium boride, and may thus be particularly suitable for use in the second stage of the method of this invention. The second stage of the method involves separating the suspended aluminium boride particles from the bulk of the molten metal. In theory, it might be possible to effect separation by allowing the particles to settle and then decanting the supernatant liquid, but this is likely to be time consuming. The separation therefore involves a filtration step in which the body of molten metal is poured into a heated filtration vessel. This may comprise an upright tapered cast iron or steel shell lined with alumina or other suitable refractory resistant to molten Al. If desired, reduced pressure can be applied on the downstream side of the filter using a vacuum pump, to draw the metal through the filter and into a receiving vessel. The metal can then, if desired, be recycled to the induction furnace for preparation of a fresh batch of the alloy. As filter media, there may be used refractory materials which are not attacked by the Al B alloy. Possible materials include the borides and nitrides of groups IIIb, IVb, Vb and VIb metals, particularly TiB₂, AlB₂, AlB₁₂, BN, TiN and AlN and these materials may have advantages in some circumstances as described below. Preferred filter media are alumina and carbon. Either can be in the form of a plate or disc shaped compact of porous or foamed material pervious to molten Al. However, it is preferred to provide the filter media in the form of a bed or compact of granular material. The most preferred filter medium is a plate or disc shaped compact of pressed unbonded or lightly sintered refractory aggregate. Alternatively, the filter may comprise a bed of loose granular aggregate supported on a refractory alumina grill. The granular aggregate is preferably of a particle size to pass through a 3 mesh sieve. If the filter medium is not wetted by Al, as is the case for alumina and carbon, then the filter openings may need to be somewhat coarser, and or a higher pressure difference may need to be applied across the filter to cause the Al to flow through it. On completion of the pour, the filter and residue are allowed to cool and removed from the vessel. The third stage of the method involves recovery of the aluminium boride in solid form. When the filter medium is of TiB₂, AlB₂, AlB₁₂, BN, TiN, AlN or similar materials, it may be possible to use the precipitated aluminium boride without separation. Thus for example a TiB₂ filter carrying precipitated AlB₂ or AlB₁₂ can be used for reaction with TiN or TiH₂ for production of a TiB₂ AlN or TiB₂ Al composite. Alternatively, a TiN filter carrying precipitated AlB₂ can be used directly in reaction 1 above. Filter media carrying precipitated aluminium borides may also contain residual Al metal. The latter can if necessary be removed, e.g. by leaching with a dilute mineral acid, in order to enable the filter medium to be mixed with the other powdered reactants. When the filter medium is alumina or carbon, it will normally be desired to recover the aluminium boride from the filter. This may be effected by dissolving the filter medium in a solvent in which the aluminium boride is insoluble. Thus, for example, smelter grade alumina is readily attacked by mineral acids such as HCl, HNO₃ and H₂SO₄. AlB₂ is reported to be insoluble in HNO₃ and H₂SO₄, and these acids therefore offer a means of separating AlB₂ from an alumina filter medium. AlB₁₂ is reported to be insoluble in HCl and H₂SO₄, and these acids therefore offer a means of separating AlB₁₂ from an alumina filter medium. AlB₂ is reported to be soluble in HCl, while AlB₁₂ is reported to be soluble in HNO₃. Hence, treatment with either HCl or HNO₃ offers a means for separating AlB₂ from AlB₁₂ if this is desired. Aluminium borides can be separated from a granular carbon filter by converting the latter to methane. This may be effected by exposing the carbon to hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures in the presence of a finely divided nickel catalyst. Such a process can conveniently be effected in a controlled atmosphere horizontal tube furnace. The finely divided metallic nickel can be subsequently separated from the aluminium borides by exposure to a stream of carbon monoxide gas which converts the former to gaseous nickel carbonyl, from which the nickel can subsequently be recovered and re used. Alternatively, it may be possible to separate the greater part of the AlB₂ from the filter medium by selective screening as the filter medium would normally be considerably coarser.
