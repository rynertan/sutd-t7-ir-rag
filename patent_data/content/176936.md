# Electrophotographic photosensitive member.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic photosensitive member com prises a conductive substrate 4 , a blocking layer 6 formed on the conductive substrate, a photoconductive layer 8 formed on the blocking layer and a surface layer 10 formed on the photoconductive layer. The blocking layer 6 is formed on a microcrystalline silicon which is made a p type by being heavily doped with an element of group III of the Periodic Table. The photoconductive layer 8 is formed on an amorphous silicon which is lightly doped with an impurity element and which is similar in property to an intrinsic semi conductor. Rectifying contact is formed between the photoconductive layer and the blocking layer so that a depletion layer is formed from that interface toward the interior of the photoconductive layer 8 . By so doing, it is possible to obtain a photosensitive member having a high sensitivity to form visible light to near infrared light.
