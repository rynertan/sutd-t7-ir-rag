# Box in the shape of an envelope, particularly for matches.

## Abstract
A box in the shape of an envelope has a closure flap 2 hinged to a long side of its top face 6 . One of the two large faces of the box has in its upper side an opening 3 adapted to be closed by the closure flap 2 .

## Claims
Claims 1. A box in the shape of an envelope, particularly for matches, characterized in that its upper face 6 is fixed and along a long side thereof a closure flap 2 of the box is hinged, one of the two larger faces of the box having, in its upper side, an opening 3 adapted to be closed by the closure flap 2 . 2. A box in the shape of an envelope as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that all its smaller faces are stably connected to one another and, once the box is assembled, the upper face 6 is strengthened by an extension of two flaps in the form of strips 10, 11 which are the continuation upwardly of the smaller side faces of the box, said flaps 10, 11 being folded on the upper face 6 of the box and glued to it.

## Description
Box in the shape of an envelone. particularly for matchesThe present invention refers to a box in the shape of an envelope, particularly for matches, but adapted to contain other solid products.The prior art boxes in the shape of an envelope have the disadvantage that their opening is not particularly easy, in fact many consumers prefer, in order to open the box, to tear a flap of the upper side thereof. As a result the box obviously cannot be reclosed with the disadvanta ge that the matches can easily go out of the box.Anyway, even in the case the box is correctly opened, it is a problem to keep it closed because the closure flap has already intrinsically the tendency to open and, since these prior art boxes are rather deformable, especially at their upper side, it is sufficient a little accidental deformation thereof for releasing the tongue of the closure flap from the closure slit and to cause the box to open by itself.The deformability of the upper side of the prior art boxes is due to the fact that these boxes can be opened at their upper face whereby there is no structural continuity of the box whose upper face is as though it were completely missing. In fact, said upper face is hinged to but one of the adjacent faces, along one of its long sides, while any connection with the other adjacent faces of the box is missing.The present invention aims to obviate the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art boxes in the shape of an envelope.More particularly the box in the shape of an envelope according to the invention is characterized in that its upper face is fixed and along a long side thereof a closure flap of the box is hinged, one of the two large faces of the box having, in its upper side, an opening adapted to be closed by the closure flap.The box in the shape of an envelope according to the pre sent invention can be easily opened and closed by the con sumer and, because of its particular structure which gives it a substantial strength and non deformability, it is not subject to open accidentally by itself.The invention will be better understood from the following description of a box in the shape of an envelope according to the invention shown in the figures of the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows the box in the shape of an envelope according to the invention in its closed condition, ready for the consumer, andFig. 2 shows the same box partially assembled in its condition prior to its filling with matches.It is seen from the Figs. that the box in the shape of an envelope eccording to the invention can be opened at one of its large faces 1, a closure flap 2 being adapted to close an opening 3 on the face 1 providing the access to the box. The closure flap 2 can be kept in its closing position by leans of a tongue projecting therefrom and which is inserted in the closure slit 5 on the face 1 of the box, said tongue 4 being retained in the slit 5 until it is withdrawn as a result of the fingers action on the edge of the closure flap 2. When it is desired to open the box it will be sufficient therefore to remove the tongue 4 from the slit 5 and rotate the flap 2 about its upper side which is common to the upper face 6 of the box.This upper face 6 is fixed and is connected along its periphery to the three also fixed adjacent faces of the box, i.e. the two side faces 7 and 8 and the rear face 9.Viceversa, in the prior art boxes in the shape of an envelope the upper face is movable being hinged at one of its long sides, and the access to the box is substantially through this upper face. It is clear that this conformation of the prior art boxes has a much greater deformability than that according to the invention in which there is a continuity in the connection of the smaller faces of the box which gives it a much higher rigidity.The connection of the upper face 6 with the side faces 7 and 8 is obtained by glueing on the outside to the upper face 6 the two flaps 10 and 11 in the form of a strip which actually are present also in the prior art boxes, but are arranged inside the box, beneath the upper face 6 and are not glued to it, these flaps 10 and 11 having the only function to prevent the matches from going out of the slits which remain at the short sides of the upper face 6 when the box is closed. In the case of the box according to the invention these flaps 10 and 11 can be advantageously formed in a length greater than that of the corresponding flaps of the prior art boxes, so that, once they are glued to the upper face 6, they give said face a greater rigidity which reduces its deformability.The box according to the invention is obtained by starting from a die cut blank similar to that of the prior art boxes in the shape of an envelope. The only differences are due to the fact that an opening for the access to the box is provided at that face which will be one of the longer faces of the box and that at the opposite end of the die cut blank there is provided a closure flap of such a shape as to enable to close the opening for the access to the box. For the sake of convenience in the production of the box it may be suitable not to fill the box according to the invention only after it has been fully assembled, but to carry out the filling already when the box is only partial ly assembled, i.e. in the condition illustrated in Fig. 2, in which the flaps 10 and 11 have not yet been folded about their respectirve scores 12 and 13 to be then glued to the upper face 6 of the box.
