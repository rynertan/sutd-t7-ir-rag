# MULTISTAGE ANNEALING OF ARAMIDE REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANES

## Abstract
A process for forming a reverse osmosis membrane is disclosed. The process involves casting a solution of an aromatic polyamide and a modifying salt to form a layer which is dried and quenched with water to gel the aromatic polyamide, and annealed in water at 40 110 C and prefer ably 40 to 90 in a plurality of stages with the final stage being at more than 60 C.
