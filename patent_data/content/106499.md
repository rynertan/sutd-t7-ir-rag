# Shift register delay circuit.

## Abstract
The clock signal to a fine delay shift register 52 is divided by the number of fine delay counts for application to a coarse delay shift register 51 such that two serially connected shift registers can provide a range of delays equivalent to a shift register having a number of counts equal to the product of the counts of the two shift registers.
