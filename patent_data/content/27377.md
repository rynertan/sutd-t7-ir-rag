# Derivatives of hydroxyl bearing substrates, process for their preparation and a method of application.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a derivative of an hydroxyl bear ing substrate by reacting an hydroxyl bearing substrate with oxirane bearing molecules to produce an oxirane ring bearing substrate and reacting the oxirane ring with a substituted primary aromatic amine selected from primary aromatic amine alcohols and primary aromatic amine thiols. Among the compositions so produced is a stable modified hydroxyl bearing substrate or hydroxyl bearing sheet having coval ently bonded thereto primary aromatic amines which can be diazotized. The diazotized substrate selectively, covalently binds proteins, polypeptides, peptides, nucleic acids, RNA, single stranded DNA, and nucleic acid hybrids.
