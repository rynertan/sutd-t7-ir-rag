## Description
PYRROLIDINE DERIVATIVES AND PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUCH COMPOUNDS This invention relates to a process for the preparation of certain pyrrolidine derivatives which are useful intermediates in the preparation of biologically active molecules. Most of the compounds are novel. Certain derivatives of 2 carboxy 3 azabicyclo 3.1.0 hexane have useful plant growth regulating activity, being capable of sterilizing the male anthers of plants. The 3 azabicyclo 3.1.0 hexane ring system is however very difficult to synthesise.A method has now been found for the preparation of certain pyrrolidine derivatives which may be used in the preparation of 2 carboxy 3 azabicyclo 3.1.0 hexane derivatives thereof. The invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the general formula EMI1.1 R1 each of R1 R2 Fizzand R4 wherein each of , R2, R3 and R4, any two or more of which may be the same ar different, represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group which may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more aLkoxy groups or R1 and R4 have the above meaning and R2 and R3 together represent an alkylene group which comprises reacting a cyclopropane derivative which is a compound of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 have the meanings given for the general formula I, or a mono or di acyl halide or a mono or di ester or the anhydride thereof, with ammonia and optionally water and effecting cyclisation by subjecting the resultant product to elevated temperature Suitable cyclopropane derivatlses to be used as starting materials for the process according to the invention include the free cos acid of formula II and the anhydride thereof. If an acyl halide is used, this is preferably the di acyl chloride If an ester is used, this is preferably a dialkyl ester, for example the dimethyl or diethyl ester In all cases, a cis compound must be used, in order that cyclisation may be effected after the treatment with ammonia The most preferred cyclopropane derivative starting material is the anhydride of the acid of the formula II. Preferably each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 represents a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group having up to 6 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group having up to 10 carbon atoms or R2 and R3 together form an alkylene group containing up to 6 methylene groups. More preferably each of R1, R , R3 and R represents a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted alkyl or alkenyl group having up to 4 carbon atoms, for example a methyl group or R2 and R3 together form an alkylene group containing 4 or 5 methylene groups. An especially preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention is one in which 3 aza bicyclo05 l Olhexane 2,4 dione of formula is preparedEMI2.2 The cyclopropane derivative starting material may be reacted with gaseous ammonia, with liquid ammonia or with a solution of ammonia, for example an aqueous solution of ammonia If an aqueous solution is used, this is preferably a concentrated solution, for example 880 ammonia i.e. a saturated solution . The reaction of the cyclopropane derivative with the aqueous ammonia preferably takes place at a temperature in the range of 10 to 100 C, preferably 15 to 500 C most preferably, the reaction, which is generally exothermic, is performed without external heating. Preferably, however, gaseous ammonia is used as reactant, In this case, the reaction is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range 50 to 2000C, more preferably 80 to 1500C, especially 100 to 140 C. The reaction may if desired be conducted under pressure, for example under a pressure of up to 100 atmospheres, but is preferably conducted under atmospheric pressure. An intermediate product is formed during the process according to the invention, the nature of which depends on the starting materials and the reaction conditions used, If for example the starting material is the free acid of the formula II, or if the acid anhydride is reacted with ammonia and with water, the monoor di ammonium salt of the acid of tAb formula II is formed, depending on the quantity of ammonia used The salt may if desired be isolated from the reaction mixture Heating yields the desired compound of the general formula I. Suitably the salt is heated in an inert atmosphere, for example of nitrogen or a noble gas, and preferably to a temperature in the range 150 to 300 C, especially 175 to 2750C However, if for example the cyclopropane derivative used as starting material is an acyl halide or an ester, or if gaseous ammonia is reacted with the acid anhydride, the reaction generally proceeds via formation of one of the intermediatesEMI3.1 orEMI3.2 which generally need not be isolated from the reaction mixture.It is generally preferred to prepare as intermediate a compound of the formula V, as this may be cyclised at a lower temperature than the compound of formula IV. Suitably, the ammonia is bubbled through the reaction mixture which is preferably maintained at a temperature in the range 65 1500C, preferably 100 140 C. When from one to two moles, preferably substantially one mole, of ammonia has been taken up per mole of cyclopropane derivative starting material, the reaction mixture is heated preferably to a temperature in the range 150 3000C, to cyclise the compound of the general formula IV or V. Suitably this heating is carried out under an inert atmosphere.A compound of formula IV is preferably heated to a temperature in the range 200 300 0C, more preferably 250 280 C in order to effect cyclisation, while a compound of formula V is preferably heated to a temperature in the range 150 to 2500C, preferably 160 to 180 C. Most of the compounds of the general formula I are novel.The invention therefore provides a compound of the general formula I as defined above, with theprovisos that, if R1 represents an ethyl or E chlorophenyl group then at least one of R2, R3 and R is other than a hydrogen atom, and if R represents a phenyl group and R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, then 4 at least one of R3 and R is other than a hydrogen atom. The following Examples illustrate the invention. In eachExample, the identity of the product was confirmed using elemental analysis and NMR and infra red spectral analysis.Example 1 Cyclopropane 1,2 dicarboxylic anhydride was mixed with .880 ammonia solution in the molar ratio anhydride NH3 approximately 1 2. A very exothermic reaction ensued, and a homogeneous solution was formed. The solvent was stripped on a rotary evaporator, and the resulting glass was allowed to crystallise. The resulting solid diammonium cyclopropane l,2 dicarboxy late was heated at 2000C for 10 minutes and then at 260 2750C for a further 20 minutes, During the heating, water was distilled off and ammonia was evolved, The cooled melt was triturated with ethanol, and the resulting solid was filtered and sucked dry.The crude solid sublimed at 0.1 mm pressure and 100 C, and the resulting white solid was re crystallised from ethanol to give colourless crystals of 3 aza bicyclo 3 1.0 hex2ne 2,4 dione, M.Pt. 97 99 C, The IR spectrum showed absorption peaks at 3140 cm , 1755 cm 1 and 1675 l cm Elemental analysis was as follows Calculated for C H 0 N C54.3 H4.6 N12,6 552 Found C54,1 H4. 5 N12 6Example 2 112g of l,2 cyclopropanedicarboxylic anhydride were weighed into a 250 ml flask fitted with a gas inlet pipe, a condensor and a thermometer, The anhydride was warmed to 86 C and ammonia was bubbled into the flask, which was cooled by a stream of air, 18g of ammonia were added over the course of an hour, during which the temperature rose to 148 C and then fell to 112 C. A stream of nitrogen was then flushed through the flask, which was warmed to 170 C to dehydrate the reaction mixture The reaction mixture was then cooled to 1000C and poured into 250 ml isopropyl alcohol cooled to 0 C on a carbon dioxide isopropyl alcohol bath, The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with cold petroleum B,Pt, 60 70 C , and air dried overnight. 79 3g of 3 aza bicyclo 3.1. 0 hexane 2,4 dione as beige crystals, M.

The resulting mixture, which was homogeneous except for a few oily drops, was stripped on a rotary evaporator to give 11. Og of an orange yellow, sticky solid. After recrystallisation from demineralised water, 4,5g of cis 1,2 diaminocarbonylcyclopropane were obtained as crystals,M.Pt, 243 245 C. lg of this product was heated, under a nitrogen blanket, at 265 2700C, Vigorous effervescence caused by liberation of ammonia ensued, and ceased after 15 20 minutes Trituration of the resulting cooled melt with ethanol gave a brownish solid which was recrystallised from ethanol, Crystals of 3 azabicyclo 3.1.0 hexane 2,4 dione, M,Pt. 97 99 C, were obtained,
