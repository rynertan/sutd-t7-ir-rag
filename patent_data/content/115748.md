## Description
AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY, NON STEROIDEUS PREPARATION FOR THETREATMENT OF THE ARTHRO RHEUMATIC DISEASES AND METHOD FOROBTAINING SUCH A PREPARATIONThe present invention relates to a non steroideus preparation having anti pyretic properties and which is obtained by acetylation of the 4 hydroxy 2 methyl N 2 pyridil 2H l 2 benzothiazine 3 carboxyamide 1 1 dioxide.The starting product is known on the market as a product of the Oxicam series and is indicated with the trademark name Piroxicam . It is known that the ratio between the chemical constitution of the pharmaceutic products and the pharmacologic action thereof is the main problem of the experimental pharmacology and that, according to what E.Adami Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy has written, the aromatic compounds have often an antipyretic and antiseptic action, as, for instance, the phenol, the salicylic acid, the antipyrine and so on.This invention starts from the presupposition that, if anOH hydroxyl group is introduced in the aliphatic chains, it increases generally the pharmacologic activity thereof in contrast, if it is introduced in the aromatic series, the toxicity is increased.The acetylation of an active principle Of such a chemical constitution thus leads to less toxic compounds. In fact the acetamide is less toxic than the ammonia, as well as acetanilide is less toxic than the aniline, and so on.In accordance with what A. Bonanni ExperimentalPharmacology and Toxilogy has described, the acetylation of an alcoholic function increases or modifies the pharmacologic effect the acetylcholine is more active than the choline, the acetyl salicilic acid is more active than the salicilic acid as a further example, can be cited this latter i.e. the morphine, after acetylation leads to the diacetylmorphine Heroin . If this compound is introduced in a living organism, it is easily saponified and transformed into morphine at a nascent state, which, as has been pharmacologically proved, has a more intense analgesic and narcotic activity.In addition, in so far as the salicilic acid is concerned, which has been diffusely used from ten year periods in the treatment of the rheumatism, the rheumatoid arthritis, the osteo arthrosis, the spondilite and the muscular skeletal diseases, the acetylation acetyl salicilic acid has produced compounds of superior activity, thus permitting either to decrease the administration dose, or to reduce the collateral effects.The present invention thus aims at obtaining a product less toxic than the product known under the trade mark Piroxicam , by providing the acetylation of the OH group in the formula of the 4 hydroxi 2 methyl N 2 pyridil 2H 1 2 benzothiazine 3 carboxyamide 1 1 dioxide of the compound already on the market.The utility of obtaining the acetyl compound of the Piroxicam is due to the purpose of realizing such a therapeutic means which has at the same time a less toxicity and less undesired secondary effects together with a pharmacologic anti inflammatory action of equal effectiveness in accordance with what has been stated in the preamble of the description.The method consists in carrying out a synthesis of the starting product by means of an addition of acetic anhydride and sodium acetate, heating to about 30 400C under stirring until to attain a complete solubilizing, then heating the mixture until an incipient boiling, and a flowing back for about two hours, the whole being then poured in cold water. Then the mixture is allowed to rest for about 24 hours, then carrying out a filtering and washing. The filtering residue is dissolved in ethanol and is evaporated until a new product in the form of crystals is obtained. This last operation can be repeated.As a variant of such a method provision has been made of substituting a portion of the acetic anhydride with acetic acid.Two qualitative and quantitative examples of the method are now given.Example 1 10 parts by weight of 4 hydroxy 2 methyl N 2 pyridi1 2H 1 2 benzothiazine 3 carboxyamide l 1 dioxide are added to 40 parts by weight of sodium acetate and are mixed with an addition of 120 parts by weight of acetic anhydride, stirring at a temperature of about 40 C until solubilizing.Then the mixture is heated until an incipient boiling and a flowing back for two hours and then it is poured into distilled water. The mixture is then heated for some minutes in order that the acetic anhydride can be decomposed and then is cooled. The mixture is allowed to deposit for 24 hours then it is filtered and the filtrate is washed with distilled water. The residue on the filter is dissolved at 950C by means of warm ethanol as it will be sufficient then it is hot evaporated until incipient crystallisation thereof. Distilled water is added under stirring and the obtained precipitate is recovered by a filtering and at last it is dried under an air flow. Then it is recrystallized, carrying out a cooling at the ambient temperature with an addition of anhydrous ethanol and a heating until boiling in the proportions of one part of substance per 10 parts of ethanol.Example 2 10 parts by weight of 4 hydroxy 2 methyl N 2 pyridil 2 H 1 2 benzothyazine 3 carboxyamide l 1 dioxide are dissolved in 20 parts by weight of glacial acetic acid 30 parts by weight of sodium acetate and 100 parts by weight of acetic anhydride are then added under stirring. The mixture is heated until solubilizing at 30 400C until an incipient boiling and is flowed back for two hours.Then it is poured into distilled water then it is heated for some minutes so as to decompose the acetic anhydride and then it is cooled. Afterwards the procedure as in theExample 1 is followed.The characteristics of the product which is so obtained, are the following ones Needle shaped, early white, translucent crystals, insoluble in water at ambient temperature. Product which is soluble in ethanol, more in warm than in cold conditions, in chloroform, benzene and acetic acid. Chemical name according the JUPAC Rules N 2 pyridil 4 oxy acetyl 2 methyl 2H 1 2 benzothiazine 3 carboxy amide l l dioxide. Chemical formula EMI5.1 Brute formula C17H15N3O5S Molecular weight 373.37 Product which remains stable in the time at ambient temperature and which is not hygroscopic and does not give off any scent of acetic acid. P.F. 122 C crystalized by methanol Drying loss at 600C under vacuum for 3 hours it does not lose more than 0.5 of its weight. Reaction about 250 mg are mixed, under an active stirring, with 100 ml of H20 then a filtration is carried out. The pH of the filtrate is 6.As identification and differentiations of the product of the invention, it is to be noted that 1 No reaction of the product in question takes place with ferric chloride, while reactions have been found in the starting product Piroxicam owing to the presence of the phenolic group 2 In so far as U.V. spectrophotometry is concerned, it was found that a 0.001 methanolic solution mcq 10 ml which has been examined with a spectrophotometer against a methanol white shows two absorption maxima at nm 233 and nm 280 and a minimum at nm 245. The starting product employed for the synthesis has the maxima at nm 240 and the minimum at nm 265 respectively.
