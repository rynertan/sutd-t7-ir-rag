## Description
POSITIVE DISPLACEMENT INTRAVENOUS INFUSION PUMP DEVICE AND METHOD Field of the Invention This invention relates to an intravenous infusion pump device and method and, more particularly, relates to a positive displacement intravenous infusion pump device and method. Background of the Invention It is oftentimes necessary to inject a fluid into the body of a patient. For many years, such materials were fed to a patient only by the force of gravity which necessitated placing the container, containing the liquid for delivery to the patient, at a considerable elevation above the patient. Such devices were not entirely satisfactory in view of the height requirement and difficulty in accurately regulating material flow. Regulation could only be secured by a handset tube clasp, and control was secured by counting the drops of fluid in a predetermined time, and then periodi cally checking by a nurse to determine that the desired rate of delivery was being maintained, because venous dilation changes cause variation in the resistance of flow of I.V.fluids into the body which modifies delivery rate. Gravity flow made it very difficult to maintain a regulated flow over a prolonged period of time. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in intravenous delivery pumps for the infusion of saline solutions, and the like, to a patient, and there has been a trend toward developing a positive acting pump which could be accurate in its delivery of intravenous fluid medium to the patient, could be readily adjusted, and would be positive in its operation without requiring the placing of the bottle at some distance above the patient. Most pumps heretofore suggested, however, have been rather expensive and, hence, could not be used once and then discarded. Such pumps were difficult to disassemble, sterilize, and reassemble so that sterilization and maintenance of sterile conditions proved to be difficult. In addition, known pumping devices draw from the intravenous containers and require air to be drawn into the intravenous fluid system to replace the volume of fluid displaced into the body, which can cause either contamination of the fluid from materials and organisms carried in the air or actual pumping of air into the patient 5 venous system air embolism , if the pump is not shut off when the intravenous fluid container becomes empty. The existing methods of allowing air to displace the fluid drawn from the intravenous fluid container system also results in volume delivery highly susceptible to pressure variation, causing variations in volumetric delivery. The extremes in volumetric delivery caused by pressure variation are unwanted and can cause repeated withdrawal and reinjection of the patient s blood or an overly rapid delivery of fluid to the patient. These extreme cases can cause, respectively, damage to the patient s blood or toxicity from an excessive volume of some intravenous fluids. Further, pumps of this nature can, under certain circumstances, be installed so that the action is reversed, thereby pumping blood from the patient until and if the fault is detected and corrected. Since known pumps operate with an open system, they will continue to pump air or fluid thereby causing either air embolism or draining the patient s blood supply, if not turned off at the appropriate time.Known pumps depend upon sensing means to detect failure nodes of the pump, such as pumping air and blockage of the needle site pressure build up , and do not preclude the problems because of their inherent design. Such sensing means have been known to fail from time to time. Prior art devices have heretofore been suggested for controlled liquid dispensing of a fluid in an intravenous solution see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,967,620 , and devices have heretofore been suggested and or utilized for dispensing of liquids through use of containers having compartments therein with the compartments containing the fluid being collapsed to cause fluid to be discharged therefrom see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,838,794 3,506,005 3,731,681 3,797,492 3,894,538 3,756,459 3,938,539 3,955,557 and 3,974,825 . In addition devices have herefore been suggested and or utilized for causing a fluid to be dispensed utilizing mechanical means and or vacuum means see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,884,228 and 3,965,946 . Summary of the Invention This invention provides a positive displacement intravenous infusion pump device and method which includes introducing incompressible material into a rigid container of intravenous fluid to thereby displace the fluid from the container and inject the same into the vein of a patient in a predetermined manner. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a positive displacement intravenous pump device and method It is another object of this invention to provide a positive displacement intravenous pump device and method wherein an incompressible fluid is introduced into a container to displace intravenous fluid therefrom. It is still another object of this invention to provide a positive displacement intravenous pump device and method for accurately metering fluid to a patient both as to quantity and rate. It is still another object of this invention to provide a positive displacement intravenous pump de 7ice and method wherein the rate of delivery is easily adjustable as needed or desired. It is yet another object of this invention to provide an improved displacement intravenous pump device and method which inherently protects the patient from air embolism, backlash, contamination, unwanted removal of large quantities of blood, and yet provides a simple means of detecting infiltration. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a positive displacement intravenous pump device and method that is simple and is inexpensive yet reliable in operation. With these and other objects in view, which will become apparent to one skilled in the art as the description proceeds, this invention resides in the novel construction, combination, arrangement of parts, and method substantially as hereinafter described, and more particularly defined by the appended claims, it being understood that such changes in the precise embodiments of the herein disclosed invention are meant to be included as come within the scope of the claims. Brief Description of the Drawings The accompanying drawings illustrate complete embodi menus of the invention according to the best modes so far devised for the practical application of the principles thereof, and in which FIGURE 1 is a combined block and schematic diagram of one embodiment of the pump of this invention FIGURE 2 is a combined block and schematic diagram of an alternate embodiment of the pump of this invention and FIGURE 3 is a combined, simplified block and schematic diagram of a primary delivery means of displacement which might be utilized in this invention. Description of the Invention Intravenous feeding fluids are commonly available from their manufacturers in one of two distinctly different storage and dispensing packages. One group of these packages is rigid bottles made of substances such as glass or plastic, while the second group of packages consists of containers made of soft and collapsible material, such as flexible plastic film in bag form. Pump device 7 achieves beneficial results through isolation of the intravenous system from air, incompressibility of the system, and finite delivery capability, all of which are achieved by positive displacement of intravenous fluid by incompressible substances as disclosed in this invention. As shown in FIGURE 1, pump device 7 includes a rigid fluid container 9 normally provided by the intravenous fluid supplier which contains the intravenous fluid material.As can be appreciated, the quantity and specific intravenous fluid and the quantity of the incompressible material required to replace it are selected as necessary for the particular intravenous feeding needed by the patient. A bladder, or other expandable means, 11 is placed in the container 9 and an inlet 13 through stopper 14 provides an opening to bladder 11. Inlet 13 is connected to incompressible material storage receptacle 15 through an alternate metering device 17 and conduits 19 and 21. A programmable control 23 controls operation of metering device 17 and hence controls introduction of incompressible material into bladder 11 within container 9. The incompressible material can be, for example, a fluid, such as water, and can also be a solid, and the programmable control can be any conventional device suitable for controlling opening and closing of a valve including partial opening and closing and could be, a metering device, such as for example, a mechanical drive with a cam and cam follower or an electronic programmer.In addition, the programmable control 23 may be of any means, mechanical or electronic, and may control either the metering means 17 or the mechanical primary delivery means 15 rate, or both. Outlet 25 provides, through stopper 14, a discharge opening communicating with the interior of container 9.Outlet 25 is connected with an injection means 27 such as a needle, for example, for passage of fluid thereto, through the usual tubing, drip chambers, medication injection sites, etc., which constitute the delivery control system 29 and conduits 31 and 33. Delivery control system 29 can be utilized to sense the flow of fluid to the patient and can be connected with an alarm 35 as can metering means 17 to indicate if the flow is either above or below a predetermined minimum such as, for example, if the flow essentially stops indicating a malfunction of the device. While the mechanical rate of feeding speed of the primary delivery means 15 may be varied as needed to control the rate at which incompressible material is injected into bladder 11 within solution container 9, metering means 17 may also be used as is indicated by the dashed lines ofFIGURE 1 as the primary method of controlling the rate at which incompressible material is injected into the I.V.container. When metering means 17 is so utilized, varying the mechanical rate of feeding speed of the primary delivery means 15 may be eliminated or may be utilized to act as a parallel system to that afforded by metering means 17 to thereby increase the certainty of achieving the desired rate of delivery of the incompressible material. Conventional apparatus may be utilized for the Iv container, conduits, delivery means, and injection means. In addition, bladder 11 could be eliminated from the system if the incompressible material used to displace the I.V.solution were of such a nature, liquid or solid, that it is not miscable with the I.V. solution and could not enter outlet 25 and be conducted through delivery system 29 and eventually into the patient. A second embodiment 47 of the invention is shown inFIGURE 2. As shown, container 49 has bag 51 therein, which bag is of the flexible or collapsible bag style of I.V.solution containers, and the remaining volume of container 49 is filled with incompressible material, then sealed, as by stopper 52, to thereby produce a positive displacement system through use of injection of incompressible material through inlet 54 and discharge of I.V. solution from the bladder 51 through outlet 56 which otherwise operates exactly as does the device as shown in FIGURE 1. Thus, the distinction between the devices, as shown in FIGURES 1 and 2, and the methods of operation is that one uses an inflatible bladder or non miscable, incompressible material to displace the I.V. solution FIGURE 1 while the other causes displacement of I.V. solution from a bladder FIGURE 2 . A simplified pump 77, felt to be useful in this invention, is shown in FIGURE 3. As shown, cylinder 79 is filled with incompressible material. Piston 81 is moved forward by a rotating screw 83, turning in the threaded base 82 of piston 81. The rotating screw 83 has its threads periodically interrupted, allowing spring 84 to cause piston 81 to retract a distance sufficient to verify that infiltration is not occurring. Nut 85 is spaced from the threaded base of piston 81 sufficiently to ensure that spring 86 creates sufficient tension to eventually offset the pull of spring 84. Spring 84 is overcome sufficiently to allow screw 83 to re engage the threaded base of piston 81 and force the continuation of the forward motion of piston 81.Screw 83 is driven by gears 87 and 88 with gear 88 being rotatively driven by conventional friction cone drive 89, thereby providing continuous variability in the speed of piston 81 forward motion. As shown, friction cone drive 89 is driven by a motor 90. The exact quantity of incompressible material present or displaced can be read directly by the position of the piston 81 viewed in relationship to a graticule 92 inscribed on a clear portion of cylinder 79. In operation, the incompressible material is introduced into the container having the intravenous fluid therein under control so that the fluid in the container is precisely metered from the container into the vein of the patient. The fluid can be metered in at a constant rate, or differing rates, if desired, and is carefully controlled both as to quantity and rate. In addition, by periodically withdrawing incompressible material from the container, this causes a small amount of blood to be drawn from the vein into the clear tubing above the needle site to thus provide assurance of continued proper placement of the needle in the vein. The presence of blood may be ascertained visually and or electronically. This invention thus provides a precise metering pump device and method specifically designed to displace fluids from intravenous fluid containers including currently available containers through the use of incompressible materials. The device and method departs from the presently known devices and methods which include pumping fluids from the fluid container. In the device and method of this invention, an incompressible substance is pumped into the fluid container to thereby displace the intravenous fluid therein, to achieve the following advantages 1. Air is completely eliminated from the system therefore, the danger of air embolism is non existant and contamination from air filtered through the intravenous fluids to replace fluids drawn from the container is eliminated 2. Pump backlash is eliminated since the system is incompressible and fluids can not reenter the intravenous system because of uncontrolled pressure variations and or pump malfunction 3. Because the system is incompressible, the quantity of fluids displaced is independent of back pressure introduced by changes in the patient 8 degree of vasodilation widening of the lumen blood vessels 4.Volumetric displacement produces pressures in the system only sufficient to cause the transfer of fluid volume displaced 5. By reversing the pumping action, fluids are drawn on an appropriate regular basis from the patient and if the fluid withdrawn is not blood, this indicates that the needle used to induce the intravenous fluid into the patient has moved from the vein and is allowing the fluid to infiltrate into tissue, or is disconnected from the patient. 6. Because the incompressible fluid fills the I.V.solution container and is prevented from entering the delivery means, very precise control is maintained over the total volume of substances delivered 7. The nature of the actual pumping mechanism is such that very simplified apparatus may be used a plausible example is shown in FIGURE 3 , thereby reducing costs and increasing reliability of the device and method herein disclosed 8. Because the incompressible material and the I.V. solution are separated in the I.V. solution container and because the I.V. solution container is fixed in volume, any malfunction of the device which would cause the pump to operate in reverse would self limit the amount of blood drawn from the patient and 9. For complete displacement of virtually all of theI.V. fluid solution from the I.V. solution container, the amount of incompressible material is made to equal the amount of fluid in the I.V. solution container. In view of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the device and method of this invention provides a novel positive displacement intravenous infusion pump device and method.
