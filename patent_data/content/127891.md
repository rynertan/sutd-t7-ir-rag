# Woven fabric having a velvety appearance.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a woven fabric and more particu larly to a woven fabric having a velvety appearance. At least either warp yarns or weft yarns in the fabric comprise conju gate fibers having a cross sectional configuration such that the flatness is 3.5 15.0. Conjugate fibers representing more than 35 by weight of the conjugate fiber content of the fabric at portions other than formation points of the fabric have an angle of inclination of 45 to 90 relative to the surface of the fabric. The floating distance between the formation points of the fabric covers a length of at least 1 4 of the pitch of the twist in the conjugate fiber.
