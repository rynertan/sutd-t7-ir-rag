## Description
This invention relates to methods for inactivating viruses in hemoglobin preparations. In particular it is concerned with destroying the biological infectivity of such viruses while minimally inactivating the biological activity of hemoglobin. Various literature and patent sources contain disclosures of methods for inactivating viruses in blood plasma protein fractions. An effective method employs dry heat inactivation, i.e., the lyophilized protein which is suspected to bear viral contamination is simply heated in the dry state at temperatures above about 50 C until the desired viral inactivation is achieved. A representative method of this sort is disclosed in PCT publication WO 82 03871. Another technique also employs heat, but the protein fraction is heated while in aqueous solution rather than dry. Stabilizers are included in the solutions in order to preserve the biological activity of the desired protein. For example, see U.S. patents 4,297,344 and 4,327,086 and European patent applications 53,338 and 52,827. The stabilizers that have been used for this purpose are glycine, alpha or beta alanine, hydroxyproline, glutamine, alpha , beta or gamma aminobutyric acid, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, sugar alcohols, organic carboxylic acids, neutral amino acids, chelating agents and calcium ions. No known publication discloses or suggests the use of antioxidants as stabilizers in viral thermal inactivation processes. These methods are both founded on the discovery that heat will inactivate viruses at a greater rate than the labile proteins studied provided, however, in the case of heating in solution that an agent or stabilizer is present which stabilizes the desired protein but which does not at the same time similarly stabilize the viral contaminants. Antioxidants have been used in association with hemoglobins in the past. Hollocher, J. Biol. Chem. European Patent Application 78961 teaches stabilizing crosslinked hemoglobin against oxidation by the use of an antioxidant. Daland et al., J. Lab. Clin. Med. Sodium ascorbate was disclosed to be ineffective in protecting the hemoglobin molecule from deterioration during prolonged storage. Rabiner et al., Ann. Surg. Hemoglobin solutions have been proposed for use as blood substitutes, either as a solution of crystalline hemoglobin or as a polymer crosslinked to other hemoglobin or other macromolecules such as polysaccharides. See for example U.S. patents 4,001,401 4,061,736 4,053,590 and 4,001,200 and West German offenlegungsschiften 3029307 and 2616086. All of these products are obtained by processes which use human red blood cells from whole blood as a starting material. The hemoglobin is separated from the formed matter including stroma of the red cells by lysis and centrifugation, followed by processing in accord with known techniques, including substitution with pyridoxal groups. These methods are not concerned with assuring that any viruses present in the whole blood starting material do not carry forward into the final hemoglobin product in infectious form. It is well known that whole blood can contain hepatitis A, B and non A, non B virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and, it is speculated, a viral etiological agent for acquired immunedeficiency syndrome AIDS . It is an object of this invention to reduce the risks of infection of patients by adventitious viral contaminants in hemoglobin containing composition administered to such patients. It is a further object to do so without denaturing a substantial proportion of the hemoglobin so that it becomes incapable of performing its oxygen transport function The term hemoglobin as used below is generic for oxy , carboxy and deoxyhemoglobin, as well as pyridoxalated covalently bonded to pyridoxal groups by reaction with pyridoxal 5 phosphate and or crosslinked derivatives thereof unless otherwise stated. Crosslinked derivatives include glutaraldehyde, ring opened diol, or 3,5 dibromosalicyl bis fumarate DBBF crosslinked hemoglobin. These hemoglobin derivatives are well known. I have now discovered a method for reducing the risk of biologically infectious virus in hemoglobin containing compositions, which comprises heating a the composition and b a reducing agent under conditions such that the virus is rendered substantially biologically inactive without substantially biologically inactivating the hemoglobin. The product of this process contains biologically active hemoglobin, heat inactivated virus residues and is substantially free of biologically inactive hemoglobin. The final products also may contain the reducing agent. And the composition may be dry or aqueous solutions. Fig. 1 discloses the stabilizing effect of dithionite reducing agent on hemoglobin after heating in solution at 56 C for 10 hours. Biologically active hemoglobin is hemoglobin which is capable of Hemoglobin compositions include the hemoglobin derivatives discussed above as well as native, substantially purified hemoglobin, including crystalline hemoglobin. Ordinarily one will not be interested in methemoglobin or its derivatives because they are not biologically active as defined in the preceding paragraph. Suitable hemoglobin compositions ideally will contain at least 99 hemoglobin by weight of total protein, total phospholipid content of less than about 3 ug ml, less than about 1 ug ml of either phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylethanolamine, inactive heme pigment of less than 6 , an oxygen affinity P The hemoglobin composition generally will be dissolved in water at a concentration of about from 1 to 40 g dl, preferably about from 1 to 14.5 g dl prior to heat treatment. The concentration selected will depend upon whether the solution is intended to be used as such for therapeutic use or to be further processed by ultrafiltration and the like, or lyophilized. In the later situations the concentration can he any that is conveniently handled in the subsequent processing steps. Where the product is to be infused it preferably will have concentration of about from 13.5 to 14.5 g hemoglobin composition dl. The reducing agent is a substance or chemical or physical intervention that maintains the hemoglobin in the deoxy form during heating, but generally is a chemireductant which should be physiologically acceptable and will have a reducing potential greater than or more effective than ascorbate. I have found that ascorbate is relatively ineffective in heat stabilizing hemoglobin for the purposes herein. Reduced redox dyes and sulfhydryl or sulfoxy compounds include many acceptable agents. Suitable reducing agents are alkali metal dithionite, bisulfite, metabisulfite or sulfite, reduced glutathione and dithiothreitol. Dithionite is preferred. The agents easily may be assayed for efficacy by the method shown in Example 2 below. The quantity of reducing agent to be included in the aqueous solution of the hemoglobin composition will vary depending upon the reducing strength of the agent, the quantity of hemoglobin, the estimated viral burden and as a consequence the intensity of the heat treatment , the presence of oxidizing solutes and oxygen, and other factors as will be apparent to the skilled artisan. Accordingly, the optimal concentration will be determined by routine experiments. This can be done by following the Various additives may be present in the composition in addition to the reducing agent. For example, buffers such as phosphate, bicarbonate or tris to pH of about from 7 8 , inorganic ions in concentrations generally less than found in plasma e.g., sodium and chloride at concentrations of no more than about 150 meq l each and lyophilization stabilizers such as amino acids or saccharides. One should use nonreducing sugars such as mannose or sugar alcohols when lyophilized hemoglobin compositions are heat treated. The heat treatment of the hemoglobin solution containing the reducing agent may be effected by any method for heating such as microwave or infrared radiation, or thermal contact by such devices as resistance heaters or water baths. The temperature of the composition is increased as rapidly as possible consistent with relatively uniform heating, in order to avoid localized overheating, up to a viral inactivating temperature. This temperature will range about from 50 C to 80 C, preferably about 60 C, if the inactivation is to occur over a reasonably brief period of time. This typically will range about from 5 to 15 hours, preferably 10 hours for solutions and about from 20 to 96 hours for dry compositions. The shorter incubations will be used with higher temperatures. The time and temperature of inactivation will depend upon a number of factors such as the viral bioburden, the protein concentration, the nature of the hemoglobin cross linked or not and the reducing agent concentration. The efficacy of the treatment process for viral kill is best assayed by seeding an aliquot of the composition to be treated with a candidate virus noninfective for man such as animal viruses or bacteriophage, for example sindbis, cytomegalovirus or T4. Suitable methods for such assays are disclosed in PCT publication WO 82 03871. The reducing agent concentration and the time and temperature of candidate virus inactivation are balanced against the loss of hemoglobin biological activity to arrive at the optimal conditions for heat inactivation. The inactivation of candidate virus should proceed until a reduction of at least 3 and preferably 6 logs of viral activity has been achieved. This can be accomplished by the method herein without a substantial loss in hemoglobin biological activity, i.e. only about from 1 to 15 mole percent of hemoglobin is rendered biologically inactive in the ordinary case. The resulting product will contain biologically active hemoglobin, will be substantially free of biologically inactive hemoglobin and will contain biologically noninfectious virus. The residues of biologically noninfections virus may be detected by immune assays for viral antigens, which are generally not immunologically destroyed by the process, as compared to Heat treated solutions are processed in order to make them convenient for therapeutic use. Dilute hemoglobin solutions may be concentrated by ultrafiltration and or lyophilization. Ultrafiltration is useful also if necessary to remove excess reducing agent, i.e. to reduce the concentration of reducing agent to a physiologically acceptable level. This will ordinarily be on the order of less than about 5 mM, but the exact amount will depend on the estimated rate of infusion and the character of the reducing agent. For example, reduced glutathione is relatively innocuous and may remain in the composition in relatively high proportions. The heat treatment step can be performed before or after the pyridoxalation or cross linking referred to above. Preferably the hemoglobin is pyridoxalated and crosslinked before heat treatment. This helps to ensure that any viral contamination which may occur during manufacturing is also dealt with. If the amount of reducing agent used during heat treatment is physiologically acceptable then the heating can occur in final filed containers such as bags or vials. The hemoglobin composition is advantageously in aqueous solution when heat treated but dry composition also can be heat treated. For example, if the hemoglobin composition is intended for long term storage it may be lyophilized or dried from a solution containing the reducing agent, and then heated. The following examples are intended to be illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. This contemplated procedure is illustrative of the manner in which hemoglobin compositions may be treated in accord with this invention. A solution is prepared which contains 1g stroma free hemoglobin, 30 mM of sodium dithionite Na Two test samples of stroma free 0.04 g hemoglobin solutions in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer with 92 mM sodium dithionite were heated in sealed vials without head space in a water bath for 10 hours at 56 C. Controls were 1 otherwise identical hemoglobin solution except for the absence of sodium dithionite and 2 the dithionite containing solution which was not heated but stored at room temperature for 10 hours. One of the test samples was dialyzed to remove the dithionite. Aliquots were withdrawn from both test samples and both controls and the O.D. determined over the range of 400 to 700 millimicrons. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The test sample and unheated control containing the reducing agent both showed the typical deoxyhemoglobin spectrum. The test sample from which dithionite had been removed exhibits the oxyhemoglobin spectrum, which is biologically active. On the other hand, the heated control hemoglobin is by spectral analysis virtually all methemoglobin, biologically inactive. Thus, the biological activity of the hemoglobin is retained in the presence of reducing agent but is lost upon heating without reducing agent. The procedure of Example 1 is repeated in this contemplated example with the heated test composition containing reductant. This composition was divided into 3 aliquots which respectively were seeded with sindbis, encephalomyocarditis EMC , and adeno type 5 virus so that the concentration of virus was, respectively, 6 7 log The TCID designation may be explained as follows In biological quantitation, the end point is usually taken as the dilution at which a certain proportion of the test system cells react or die. The 100 end point is frequently used. However, its accuracy is greatly affected by small chance variations. A desirable end point is one representing a situation in which one half of the test system reacts while the other one half does not. The best method is to use large numbers of test systems at closely spaced dilutions near the value for 50 reaction and then interpolate a correct value. The negative logarithm of the The EMC and sindbis virus infective titer is obtained by preparing dilutions of viral suspension as described above. BGMK cell monolayers were prepared in 35mm petri dishes. Viral adsorption to the cells was initiated by adding 0.2 ml of suspension to the monolayer. After 1 hour, the monolayer was overlaid with 2 ml of nutrient agar medium and incubated for 24 72 hours at 37 C. The plaques which formed were then made visible by staining the cells with neutral red at 1 2000 by weight in saline. The results with virus were subjected to regression analysis with the method of least squares to allow the fitting of a linear line to the data and plotted. Similar results were obtained with all viruses. The viral infective titer in all three aliquots was reduced significantly by the method 1 heat tratment, thereby reducing the risk of patient infection by hepatitis or other viruses. The method of Example 1 was repeated in this contemplated example except that the stroma free hemoglobin had been crosslinked by 3,5 dibromosalicyl bis fumarate and subsquently pyridoxalated in accord with the method disclosed by Tye et al., in Bolin et al., editors,
