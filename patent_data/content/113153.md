# A process for the manufacture of highly pure trimagnesium phosphate octahydrate.

## Abstract
Crystalline tertiary magnesium phosphate octahydrate having uniform and perfect crystal shape is produced by adding a monomagnesium phosphate solution to a magne sium hydroxide slurry at a temperature of from about 35 C to about 70 C and for a period of hours to form the highly pure crystalline product within a pH range of from about 6,7 to about 6,9.
