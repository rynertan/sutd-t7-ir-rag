# Improvements in or relating to multimeters.

## Abstract
A multimeter 1 is provided with two slide switches 2,3 , one switch 2 providing a selection of four functions, i.e. OFF , AC , DC JUNCTlON and RESISTANCE CONTI NUITY and the other switch 3 providing a selection of six range settings and a JUNCTION CONTINUITY setting. The multimeter also has three input sockets, two being shown at 4, 5 , for insertion of test leads. At least two of the combinations of the switches and sockets are incompatible, i.e. AC and JUNCTION CONTI NUITY , and a current input socket and RESISTANCE CON TINUITY . An internal buzzer is incorporated in the multimeter to provide an audible indication to a user that an incompatible combination has been selected. The buzzer is preferably also used in junction and continuity test modes.
