# Composite shell formed of glassy metal alloy strips.

## Abstract
A thin walled annular shell 1 of high rigidity relative to its unit weight is provided. The wall 2 of the shell 1 is a composite material built up layerwise of glassy alloy strips of high transverse aspect ratio such that each layer is a strip wrapped at a substantially 45 helix with respect to the elon gate axis of the shell 1 and with adjacent layers having alternating directions of wrap. Bonding between adjacent layers and between strips within each layer is accomplished in a selected manner such that the composite wall 2 is structur ally monolithic for thin walled applications thereby taking substantially full advantage of the extraordinary strength properties of glassy alloy strip.
