# Method and apparatus for field flow fractionation.

## Abstract
The method described is useful in field flow fractiona tion techniques for reducing separation times and improv ing the convenience and accuracy of measuring sizes or molecular weights of particulates. In field flow fractionation, the particulates particles or macromolecules are subjected to a force field and a mobile phase while passing throught a flow channel. This filed strength is decreased exponentially as a function of time. Alternatively the flow velocity is increased exponentially as a function of time. The initiation of the change in field strength or flow velocity may be delayed a period of time. If this time delay is made equal to the time constant of the exponential decay, the range of particulate retention time that is linearly related to the logarithm of the particle size or molecular weight is increased. An apparatus for implementing the method is also described and includes a function generator 100 for provid ing the desired exponential decay and delay time to a speed control 102 controlling a motor 104 of a centrifuge bowl 26.
