# Chip carrier socket and contact.

## Abstract
A chip carrier socket 14 and contact 20 which provides high contact mating forces and short circuit path length is taught. Briefly stated, a chip carrier socket housing is com prised of a base portion 12 having contacts 20 disposed therein with a retainer portion 16 being placed thereon. A chip carrier 14 having conductive leads 30 is placed be tween the base and the retainer. The retainer has a spring car rier piece 42 contained therein with the spring carrier acting on fingers 34 which are part of the retainer. The retainer fingers 34 urge the conductive leads of the chip carrier into electrical contact with the contact thereby utilizing the con tacts as points of electrical communication only and not for ex erting contact mating force.
