# Electrographic development apparatus having a mixing device with a ribbon blender.

## Abstract
An electrographic development apparatus has a sump 26 68 for receiving developer material 28 including carrier particles and toner particles. A magnetic brush 16 100 receives development material 28 from the sump 26 68 and moves the material into a positon relative to an electrostatic image carried on an insulating surface so that toner particles can be transferred to the electrostatic image to develop such image. A ribbon blender 30 70 in the sump 26 68 mixes the toner and carrier particles of the developer material 28 , circulates developer material axially within the sump 26 68 , agitates and shears the developer material, promotes tribochanging, and feeds developer out of the sump 26 68 along the path leading to the magnetic brush 16 100 .
