# Vacuum operated cutting tool and system therefor.

## Abstract
The tool includes a housing having an impeller sec tion 12B with an outlet adapted for connection to a va cuuminducing source 26 and an inlet through which ambient air enters the tool. A rotatably mounted turbine impeller 38 is located within the impeller section of the housing and is adapted to rotate in response to the vacuum induced fluidfiow. In the preferred embodiment, a motion converting mechanism is connected between the turbine impeller and a drive spindle 42 equipped with a circular saw blade 20 . The motion converting mechanism converts the rotary output motion of the turbine impeller to a rotary oscillating motion so that the saw blade is suited for use in cutting plasters casts. The air inlet 108 of the housing is advantageously located in the cutting zone of the saw blade to entrain and remove debris generated during the cutting operation.
