## Description
DERIVATIVES OF UBIQUINONE, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATIONAND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM Disclosure Ubiquinone lO , also known as Coenzyme Q10 and with struc ture analogous to that of Vitamin K2, is a cardiovascular agent known since long time, provided with a very low level toxicity see e.g. The Vitamins , W.H. Sebrell and RSHarris, pages 355 391, Academic Press, New York,1972 .It has been now found that by suitably replacing the two kgtogroups. in the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring of ubiquinone with suitable groups, novel derivatives can be obtained, which can also be administred by rectal way or can be injected and which moreover, in some cases, show a much greater light stability. By aqueous, acid or alkaline hydrolysis, these new derivatives yield easily back again the ubiquinone from which they derive.An object of the present invention are therefore new deriv atives of general formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 means SO3Na, or R1 and R2 together mean the residue of an aminoacid selected from the group constituted by glycine, L leucine, phenylglycine, phenylalanine, aspartic acid or taurine, generally in the form of an alkaline salt thereof, preferably of their sodium salt.These new derivatives of formula I are outstandingly interesting from the therapeutical viewpoint as they are obtained by means of the reaction of ubiquinone with amino acids, they can be injected yielding higher and faster lev els than when administred by the oral way. The disulphite derivative I R1 H R2 SO Na shows 3 moreover a high stability so that in the oral preparations no decompositions occur under the effect of the light.An object of the present invention are moreover the pharmaceutical formulations with anti hypertensive action containing, as their active principle, one or more compound s of general formula I .An object of the invention is finally also a process for the preparation of the compounds of general formula I , wherein ubiquinone 10 is reacted in an apolar solvent, and under refluxing conditions, with an alkaline salt, preferably with the sodium salt, of an aminoacid selected from the group constituted by glycine, L leucine, phenyl glycine, phenylalanine, aspartic acid and taurine.The reaction between ubiquinone and aminoacid is made proceed over 20 30 minutes, the reaction mixture is then cool ed and filtered.The precipitate formed is washed with a suitable solvent, preferably a lower aliphatic alcohol, and then with an ether, dried and finally crystallized.The derivative with the bisulphite is obtained by means of the simple mixing of a solution of sodium bisulphite with ubiquinone 10 . The preparation of the new derivatives of general formula I can be schematically shown as follows EMI3.1 tb CH3 SEP X SEP CH3 SEP refluxing tb SEP CH3 SEP O r SEP apolar SEP solvent tb 3 SEP A SEP CH2 CH C CH SEP SEP H SEP 2 SEP 1 2 tb SEP 2 SEP 2 SEP 10 tb SEP 0 tb wherein R1 R2 has the meaning hereinabove shown, or EMI3.2 To illustrative purposes only, in the following Table the structural formulas are reported of the aminoacids within the meanings of R1 and R2 TABLEEMI3.3 tb SEP Structural SEP formula tb SEP for SEP R1 SEP and SEP R2 SEP Chemical SEP Name tb N CH2 COONa SEP Glycine tb N CH COONa SEP L leucine tb SEP CH2 CH CH SEP tb SEP 32 tb N CH COONa SEP Phenylglycine tb N CH COONa SEP Phenylalanine tb SEP CH2C6H5 tb EMI4.1 Taurine Aspartic acid The pharmaceutical compositions with anti hypertensive activity which are the object of the present invention contain a therapeutically active amount of active principle dissolved in and or admixed with a liquid or solid support normally used for these compositions.The active principles may be administred by oral or rectal way, or they may be injected by intravenous or intramuscular way.For the dral administering, a non toxic pharmaceutical pre paration can be formed by mixing one or more compound s of formula I with the supports normally used to that pur pose, such as talc, arabic gum, sucrose, lactose, corn or wheat starch, potato flour, magnesium stearate, alginates, tragacanth gum, carrageenates, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, dispersing agents, emulsifiers and or preservatives see L.G.Goodman, A. Gilman, The Pharmacologic al Basis of Therapeutics .The end products may be used in the form of capsules, tablets, sugar coated tablets, single dose bags.For the administering by the rectal way, the active principle is combined with the usual semi synthetic glycerides, whilst in the liquid preparations there may be extemporane ous solutions or extemporaneous suspensions.The administration of the new derivatives 1 10 mg kg day is efficacious to the purpose of suppressing the development of the hypertension, or of reducing the advanced hypertension. These derivatives may be administered three times per day in parcelled doses, containing e.g. 5, 10, 20 mg of the active compounds in addition t6 the suitable physiologically tolerable supports and excipients.The pharmacological biological characteristics of the compounds being the object of the present invention, i.e.their characteristics of high activity and practical absence of secondary effects have been evaluated with particular reference to the chronic toxicity, to the effects of increase of arterial pressure induced by the carotid stoppage in anesthetized dog, to the action on the arterial pressure, always in anesthetized dog, and to the pharmacokinetcs. Chronic toxicityThe chronic toxicity of the new derivatives has been studied by oral and intravenous way in the rats of SpragueDawley stock of both sexes, of body weight of about 210 g. The new derivatives, used as drops or in aqueous solution, have been administred to groups of 10 animals 5 males and 5 females . The tests have been carried out in parallel with equivalent amounts of ubiquinone hydroalcoholic solution . The doses have been of 50 mg kg per day for three months. No toxic effects have been had in the case of the new deriv atives, likewise to the comparison drug.Effects of the new derivatives on the increase of the arterial pressure induced by carotid stoppage and administration of noradrenaline in anaesthetized dog.Mongrel dogs of both sexes, having an average body weight of 13,0 16,0 kg have been anaesthetized by intravenous administration of Nembutal, at the dosis of 30 mg kg, and submitted to bilateral vagotomy.The arterial pressure is measured from the femoral arteria by means of a pressure transducer of Statham type, connected to a pre amplifier inserted on a Hellige polygraph.After the basal measurements, the effect on the blood pressure induced by the stoppage of common carotid arteries for 1 minute and by the administration of noradrenaline at the dose of 1 Mg kg by intravenous way is evaluated.The animals are subdivided into two groups of three animals each, and receive respectively the doses of 2 and 1.0 mg kg of product by intravenous way.The carotid stoppage and the administering of noradrenaline were repeated 5 hours after the treatment, to the purpose of evaluating the effect thereof on the increase of the arterial pressure induced in the previously described ways.The results showed the antihypertensive effect, induced as hereinabove described, at both tested doses, even if such an effect is more evident at the highest doses.The results obtained with the new derivatives are equivalent to those of equivalent ubiquinone doses.Action of the new derivatives on the arterial pressure in anaesthetized dog.Mongrel dogs of both sexes having a body weight comprised within the range of from 12.0 to 15.0 kg have been submitted to bilateral vagotomy, after having been anaesthetized with Nembutal 30 mg kg by intravenous way .The systemic pressure has been measured from the femoral artery by means of a Statham type transducer, connected to a pre amplifier in its turn inserted on a Hellige polygraph.After having carried out the basal measurements, the treat ment is carried out of the animals, which are subdivided into two groups of three animals each, and which receive the doses of 2.0 and 4.0 mg kg by intravenous way, respectively.The results show that, immediately after the treatment, a small and transient increase occurs of the arterial pres sure, which lasts about 30 minutes. The arterial pressure returns subsequently to normal values, and then under them, remaining at such low values for periods of from 4 to 6 hours. The results obtained with the new derivatives are equivalent to those of equivalent doses of ubiquinone. Pharmacoki netics. When administered at dose levels equivalent to those of ubiquinone, the new derivatives show a metabolism similar to that of ubiquinone.
