## Description
ANTITETANIC ANTIBODY PRODUCING HUMAN HUMAN HYBRIDOMA AND METHOD OF PRODUCING THE SAME This invention relates to a novel human human hybridoma. More particularly, it relates to a humanhuman hybridoma having antitetanic antibody producing ability. The human human hybridoma according to this invention can be utilized for the production of a monoclonal antibody against Clostridium tetani.Further, since the cell line is of human origin, the antibody produced by said hybridoma causes no trouble due to antigenicity. Thus, a great therapeutic effect can be produced by this invention. It has been known that anti tetanus antibody has an effect of preventing the onset of tetanus by administration to persons infected with Clostridium tetani. Further, it has been revealed recently that the administration of tetanus antibody can prevent not only the onset of tetanus but also the infection itself.Accordingly, the antibody is expected to make a great medical contribution. There are in general two kinds of antibodies, namely polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal ones.Recently a technology is attracting attention wherein monoclonal antibodies are prepared by using a lymphoblastoid cell line having proliferative ability. This monoclonal antibody is a single antibody which reacts against only one kind of antigenic determinant.Preparation thereof can be conducted at present by either cell fusion method or transformation method.In both methods, there are prepared cells having concurrently both proliferative ability and antibody producing ability. The former method comprises fusion ofB cells of an immunized donor with B cell line in vitro and the latter comprises infecting B cells of an immunized donor with lymphotropic viruses such as EpsteinBarr virus to transform the former cells into immortalized cells. These methods of preparation are as yet in unripe stage and have a number of unsolved problems including improving the antibody producing capacity, safety measures against the use of toxic antigen, and overcoming the difficulty in removal of contaminating antigen by purification. Thus, there exist many difficulties to be overcome before they can be put to practical use. Namely, in cell fusion method a satisfactory antibody producing hybridoma has not yet been obtained because of low fusion efficiency and low proportion of antitetanic antibody producing cells present in the whole lymphocytes, whereas the transformation method has a drawback in that although established cells can be obtained in a very high probability the cloning efficiency is extremely low, as low only several percent. The problems relating to the antigenicity of antibodies produced can be solved by using a cell line of an animal which does not give rise to immunoreaction with human beings. It is already known in general that the safety can be maintained by using a cell line of human origin. Also in this case, however, fully satisfactory results have not yet been obtained with respect to antibody producing ability and proliferative ability. The present inventors made, as a part of an effort for establishing an antitetanic antibody producing cell line which causes no difficulties mentioned above and can be produced in a large scale, extensive studies on a human human hybridoma which is free from the problem of antigenicity. As a result, it has been found out that a human human hybridoma having a high proliferative ability and is free from the problem of antigenicity can be obtained by, as a means for overcoming the various difficulties involved in antibody production mentioned above, fusing a human B cell line having HAT hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine sensitivity and ouabain resistance, a novel parent cell, with an antitetanic antibody producing lymphoblastoid cells of human origin transformed with a lymphotropic virus such as Epstein Barr virus. This invention has been accomplished on the basis of above finding. This invention has as its object to provide a human human hybridoma for antitetanic antibody production which has an excellent proliferative ability and is free from the problem of antigenicity, and relates to a human human hybridoma obtained by fusing a human, HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line with a human, antitetanic antibody producing B limphoblastoid cell transformed with a lymphotropic virus. The cell fusion in this invention is conducted by using a cell having a proliferative ability and a cell having an antibody producing ability. The antibody producing cell used in this invention is a human, antitetanic antibody producing lymphoblastoid transformed with a lymphotropic virus. The above mentioned lymphoblastoid cell can be prepared by known methods, for example in the following manner. The tetanus antigen used to obtain said lymphoblastoid cell is an exotoxin which is a protein having a molecular weight of about 150,000 and an isoelectric point of 5.1 produced by Clostridium tetani.It can usually be prepared by purifying a commercially available detoxicated toxoid or a culture fluid conditioned by Clostridium tetani. It is also possible to subject the tetanus antigen thus obtained to a heat treatment in the presence of a protein denaturing agent to enhance its antigenicity. The antigen is preferably further purified for immunization. Stimulation of the B cell with above mentioned tetanus antigen for antibody production may be conducted either in vivo or in vitro. Stimulation in vivo can be conducted by known methods. For example, the intended human, antitetanic antibody producing B cells can be obtained by inoculating the tetanus antigen to a human being intracutaneously 2 to 3 times, collecting the blood several days after final immunization, then recovering B cells from the blood obtained above followed by purification thereof. The stimulation with tetanus antigen in vitro can be conducted, for example, by bringing a suitable amount of purified antigen into contact with B cells at 30 to 400C for 10 to 50 hours, generally in a culture medium. The separation of the antitetanic antibody producing B cells is preferably conducted by means of Ficoll Conray density gradient centrifugation. The B cell thus obtained is then transformed into the immortalized cell by using a lymphotropic virus. Lymphotropic viruses, such as Epstein Barr virus, are used in the transformation. Said viruses are known as a virus which transforms a normal cell into a immortalized one Nature 269, 420 422 1977 1. An amount of virus sufficient for enabling cell transformation is prepared beforehand by using Epstein Barr virus derived from the marmoset cell line B 95 8 free from mycoplasmas obtained as a supernatant from B 95 8 . A suitable amount of the virus thus prepared is added dropwise to a medium conditioned by B cells and the virus is contacted with the B cells at 370C for 5 to 20 days. The cultivation of B cells is conducted, for example, in 5 fetal bovine serum at 370C. The cultivation may also be conducted in a culture medium supplemented with glutamine. The immortalized B cells obtained thus by transformation are subcultured and those cells which produce antibodies against tetanus antigen are selected out of the subcloned cells and concentrated. The antitetanic antibody producing cells can be traced by such methods as, for example, PHA, EIA and ROTA. A human, HAT sensitive, ouabain resistantB cell is used in this invention as the cell having proliferative ability. The said human, HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line can be prepared by known methods. For example, an autogenetic HAT sensitive cell can be obtained when the concentration of 6 thioguanine in the medium is gradually increased over a long time in cultivation of human B cell line. Also, HAT sensitive, ouabein resistant B cell line can be prepared by gradually increasing the concentration of ouabein in the culturing medium of HAT sensitive B cell line and collecting survived cells.By this procedure, it is possible to make the cells acquire a marker function, that is, ouabain resistance, without affecting properties inherent to the cells HAT sensitivity, fusion efficiency, proliferative ability and so forth , whereby the selection of intended cells is facilitated. Then, cell fusion is conducted by using the human, antitetanic antibody producing B cells having proliferative ability owing to transformation , that is, human antitetanic antibody producing lymphoblastoid cells, and the human, HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line obtained above. The cell fusion is conducted in a manner known per se. One example thereof comprises reacting immortalized cells with aforementioned lymphoblastoid cell capale of producing antibodies in the presence of polyethylene glycol. The suitable mixing ratio of the cells is l to 10 lymphoblastoid cells relative to one immortalized cell. The fused cells thus obtained are subjected to selection using a medium supplemented with HAT and ouabain. The selection can be conducted based on the following ground. The HAT sensitivity means the property of a cell that it cannot grow or proliferate in the presence of HAT in the medium. The ouabain resistance of a cell means that the cell can proliferate even in the presence of a high concentration of ouabain.It is also known that the fusion of an ouabain resistant cell and a normal one results in an ouabain resistant cell. Accordingly, when human, HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line and human, antitetanic antibody producing lymphoblastoid cells the lymphblastoid cells being devoid of both HAT sensitivity and ouabain resistance are subjected to cell fusion and when bothHAT and ouabain are present in the medium, neither unfused B cell line nor unfused lymphoblastoid cell can proliferate, the former because of HAT sensitivity and the latter because of not being ouabain resistant, whereas successfully fused cells can proliferate because of being ouabain resistant. It is possible thus to select the fused cells alone. The antitetanic antibody producing human human hybridoma can be obtained by further screening and cloning the cells producing the intended antitetanic antibody by a known method. Since the hybridoma thus obtained is of human origin, the antibody produced therefrom causes no problem due to antigenicity against human beings.Moreover, an antibody producing cell can be obtained which is excellent in antibody producing ability and particularly in proliferative ability as compared with those obtained by simply fusing human HAT sensitive B cell line with human, antitetanic antibody producing B cells or by merely transforming human, antitetanic antibody producing lymphoblastoid cells transformed withEpstein Barr virus. By proliferating the hybridoma in a growth medium, monoclonal antibodies can be produced continuously and then recovered from the medium. This invention will be described in more detail below with refrence to Examples, but it is not limited thereto.Example 1 Each of healthy, adult volunteers was subjected to a booster immunization of tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml . Blood was collected at the about 4th day from the injection. Lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood collected above by means ofFicoll Conray density gradient centrifugation and then T cells were removed therefrom by means ofE rosette formation to obtain B cells alone.The B cells were then cultivated in an RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15 fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine medium cell density 1 x 106 cells ml .Meanwhile, B 95 8 cells Marmoset established lymphocyte cell were cultivated in an RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 fetal bovine serum medium and the supernatant culture fluid was collected after several days of cultivation to be used as Epstein Barr virus liquid concentration 105 transforming dose ml . One ml of the above mentioned medium conditioned by B cells was mixed with 0.2 ml of the Epstein Barr virus liquid to effect infection and then subjected to static culture for three weeks in a medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 208 fetal bovine serum under 5 C02 atmosphere to proliferate the cells. Recovery of antibody producing cells from the proliferated ones was conducted by limiting dilution culture method while checking by ELISA method. Thus, subcultured cells having antitetanic antibody producing ability were obtained. On the other hand, human, HAT sensitive, B cell line were prepared in the following manner.Human B cell line in their logarithmic growth phase were cultured with a medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum containing 0.05 ml of 6 thioguanine. Then Surviving cells were cultured in gradually increasing concentrations of 6 thioguanine, after 3 months, the cells were found to be resistant up to human B cell line showed high sensitivity to HAT. Human HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line were prepared in the following manner. The above mentioned human, HAT sensitive B cell line in their logarithmic growth phase were diluted in a medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum to a density of 8 cells ml. The diluted liquid was dispensed onto a 96 well microplate at a rate of 100 vlZwell to give a number of cells per well of 0.8. The plate was incubated at 370C under 5 CO2 atmosphere for about 2 weeks. After the period, proliferation of cells was observed to be occurring in a cloning efficiency of 30 to 40 . The most proliferative cells among these were adjusted to a cell density of about 106 cells ml, the resulting culture fluid was mixed with 10 7 M ,ouabain, and cultivation was conducted in the mixed medium. Similar medium exchange was repeated 2 to 3 times and finally cultivation was conducted in a medium containing 10 6 M of ouabain.Thereafter, cultivation was conducted in a medium containing no ouabain and a very small number of cells which had survived were proliferated. After about 10 days the proliferated cells were washed by centrifugation, suspended in a medium containing 10 6 M of ouabain to a density of 105 cells ml and the suspension was dispensed onto a 96 well microplate at a rate of 100 pl well. The plate was incubated for about one month, the medium being exchanged 2 times a week. Thus, cells were obtained which can proliferate even in the presence of 10 6 M ouabain. The HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line 1.5 x 106 cells and the aforementioned lymphoblastoid cells 3 x 106 cells were mixed, and the mixture was further mixed with 0.3 ml of 50 polyethylene glycol PEG 1500, mfd by BDH and was incubated at 370C for 2 minutes to effect cell fusion. After washed by centrifugation, the cells were adjusted to a density of 1 x 106 cells ml with an RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum medium and resulting liquid was dispensed onto a 96 well microplate at a rate of 100 1 well. A HAT ouabain selective medium final concentration hypoxanthine 13.61 mg l, aminopterin 0.18 mg l, thymidine 3.88 mg l, ouabain 0.5 x 10 6 M1 was added 24 hours after the PEG treatment and cultivation was then conducted for 2 weeks. As a result, proliferation of cells was observed in 20 wells among 43 wells. The antitetanic antibody activities in the supernatants of these culture fluids were screened by ELISA method. Of 12 wells which showed a high antibody production, the culture fluid contained therein was adjusted to a density of 8 cells ml by dilution with an RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum. The resulting fluid was dispensed onto a 96 well microplate at a rate of 100 pl well to give a number of cells per well of 0.8 limiting dilution culture method . Selection was conducted by checking the antibody production by means ofELISA method to obtain an established human human hybridoma In the above ELISA method was used peroxidaselabelled anti human IgA IgG IgM goat antibody mfd. by KPL Co. . It was revealed that the human human hybridoma thus obtained partook well of the nature of the respective parents as to the proliferative and antibodyproducing ability and was excellent in these properties as compared with hybridomas normal B cells and HAT sensitive B cell line or transformed cells obtained by prior methods.Experimental Example 1 Two strains of hybridomas 10C, 10D obtained in Example 1 were examined for their number of chromosomes Table 1 . The values in the Table show the number of cells having the indicated number of chromosomes. As shown in Table 1, it was revealed that the hybridomas had several to thirty more chromosomes than their parent cells, lymphoblastoid cells and HAT sensitive, ouabain resistant B cell line each having 46 chromosomes had. Thus, the fact that said cells are hybridomas differing from the parent cells is suggested also from the number of chromosomes.Experimental Example 2 The properties of the established human human hybridoma obtained in Example 1 were examined and the results were shown in Table 2. Hybridoma formation or transformation efficiency was indicated by the number of hybridomas or transformed cells emerging per 1 x 106 parent cells. Cloning efficiency , used as an index signifying the proliferative ability, indicates the probability of proliferatable hybridomas appearing in the whole emerging hybridomas. As a control were used humanB cell line and human, antitetanic antibody producing B cells, which are both the parent cells of the present hybridoma, as well as hybridoma between B cell line and normal B cells and lymphoblastoid cell transformed withEpstein Barr virus. As shown in Table 2, it was revealed that the established human human hybridoma of this invention can become a very effective antitetanic antibody producing cell with a good emerging rate as well as a good proliferative ability. Moreover, the hybridoma of this invention causes no problem due to antigenicity because it is of human origin.
