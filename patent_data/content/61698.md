# Orbiting piston type fluid displacement apparatus with a rotation preventing device.

## Abstract
A rotation preventing thrust bearing device for use in an orbiting piston type fluid displacement apparatus is dis closed. The rotation preventing thrust bearing device 37 includes a discrete fixed portion, a discrete orbital portion and bearing elements 377 . Each of the fixed and orbital portions includes an annular race 371, 374 and ring 372, 375 to cover the end surface of the race 371, 374 . The both rings 372, 375 have a plurality of holes or pockets 372a, 375a in an axial direction. The radius of each fixed pocket 372a is formed greater than the radius of each orbital pockets 375a . The bearing elements 377 each of which is placed between the edge of both pockets 372a, 375a , are permitted to effect the rolling motion of the radius R1 with regard to the fixed race 371 and also permitted to effect the rolling motion of the radius R2 with regard to the orbital race 374 . The total amount of the both rolling radii is substantial ly aligned with the orbiting radius of an orbiting piston 27 . The rotation of the orbiting piston 27 is whereby prevented by the bearing elements 377 which interacts with the edge of both pockets 372a, 375a and the axial thrust load from the orbiting piston 27 is carried by the fixed race 371 through the bearing elements 377 .
