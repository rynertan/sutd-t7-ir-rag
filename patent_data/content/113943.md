# Shear wave acoustic logging system.

## Abstract
An acoustic well logging tool employs a bender type transducer 42 as a point source of an acoustic shear wave.

The unrestricted surfaces of the transducer 42 are oriented longitudinally along the axis of the tool and ex posed to the coupling liquid. The dimensions of the transducer 42 in the direction parallel with the longitudinal axis of the tool exceed its dimensions in the transverse direction. One or more bender type transducers of the same configuration as the transducer 42 may be employed as acoustic receivers in the tool. The active surfaces of the receiving transducers are oriented in substantially the same direction as the active sur faces of the transmitting transducer 42.

## Description
SHEAR WAVE ACOUSTIC LOGGING SYSTEM This invention relates to a shear wave acoustic well logging system. It is a well known to survey wells by acoustic logging techniques. One known acoustic logging technique involves the generation and reception of acoustic pulses and the determination of the travel time of the pulse signals between a transmitter and receiver or between spaced receivers. By this technique the velocity of sound through a subterranean formation may be determined in order to characterize the formation. Another acoustic logging technique involves amplitude logging in which the loss of amplitude of an acoustic signal as it travels between a transmitter and receiver, or between spaced receivers, is measured. Velocity and amplitude logging may be carried out separately or in combination, that is the logging tool may be equipped with appropriate circuitry to detect both the travel time of the acoustic signal and the loss in amplitude. An acoustic signal may be transmitted through a subterranean formation in both compressional and shear transverse modes. Since a shear wave cannot be transmitted along the borehole through liquid therein, it has been proposed to transmit and receive shear waves by transducers positioned in contact with the borehole wall. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,949,352 discloses a shear wave acoustic logging system employing transmitting and receiving transducers spaced in close proximity with one another and located within a transducer mounting pad which is pressed against the wall of the borehole.While this procedure requires a direct coupling of the transmitting and receiving transducers to the borehole wall, shear wave logging employing so called indirect excitation of the borehole wall is disclosed in Kitsunezaki, A New Method for Shear Wave Logging , OYOTechnical Note, Urawa Research Institute, October, 1978. In this procedure an electromagnetic transducer is suspended in water the borehole fluid and employed to generate an asymmetric shear wave pulse through the borehole fluid into the formation. The transducer is oriented such that an excitation bobbin vibrates along an axis normal to the axis of the well. The resulting shear wave is detected at a plurality of receivers spaced longitudinally from the transmitter.The receivers take the form of geophone type detectors in a detector body suspended in the borehole fluid and having an apparent density adjusted to be the same as the density of the borehole fluid. In one aspect, the present invention resides in an acoustic well logging system comprising a an elongated logging tool adapted for insertion into a borehole, b means forming a compartment in said tool containing a coupling liquid therein, c an acoustic transmitter mounted in said compartment and comprising a bender type transducer having opposed unrestricted piezoelectric planar surfaces oriented along the longitudinal axis of said tool and exposed to said coupling liquid, the dimensions of the transducer in the direction parallel with the longitudinal axis of the tool exceeding the dimensions of the transducer in the transverse direction, d means for exciting said transmitter to simultaneously flex said opposed piezoelectric surfaces in a conforming manner and generate a positive pressure wave in one direction while simultaneously generating a negative pressure wave in the opposite direction, and e an acoustic receiver mounted in said tool and spaced longitudinally from said transmitter. Preferably the receiver is also a bender type transducer mounted in a liquid filled compartment and having opposed unrestricted planar surfaces exposed to the liquid within the compartment and oriented in substantially the same direction as the transmitter. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an acoustic logging system according to one example of the present invention, Figure 2 is an illustration partly in section showing details of a portion of the tool shown in Figure 1, and Figure 3 is a sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2. Referring to Figure 1, the logging system includes an elongated logging tool 10 which is suspended from a cable 11 within a borehole 12 which traverses a subterranean formation of interest indicated by reference character 14. Formation 14 may be a suspected oil or gas bearing formation which is to be characterized in regard to its porosity, fluid saturation, or such other information as may be desired. The well 12 is filled with a liquid such as drilling mud indicated by reference numeral 16. The logging tool 10 comprises an acoustic transmitter 17 and acoustic receivers 19 and 20. Transmitter 17 and preferably also receivers 19 and 20 take the form of bender type transducers as described in greater detail hereinafter. Signals from the logging tool 10 are transmitted uphole by the conductors in cable 11 to any suitable utilization system at the surface. For example, the utilization system is illustrated as comprising an uphole analysis and control circuit 22 and recorder 24.A depth indicator produces a depth signal which is applied to the recorder 24 in order that the output from circuit 22 may be correlated with depth. The logging system may be operated in a manner to measure one or more parameters ascertainable with acoustic well logging systems.For example, the system may be operated in a velocity and or amplitude logging mode as described previously. The transmitter and receivers are controlled through suitable timing circuitry located either uphole, or in the logging tool itself. Typically, the control circuitry will comprise a time base generator which operates to produce pulses to excite transmitter 17 and which gates receivers 19 and 20. The electrical pulses produced by the time base generator are preferably voltage spikes, that is, voltage pulses of relatively high amplitude and short duration whose frequency spectrum is extremely broad. Energizing acoustic transmmitter 17 by voltage spikes cause the piezoelectric crystals see Figure 2 to resonate at a frequency determined by the dimensions of the crystal as will be explained infra.For example, the time base generator may generate a train of triggering pulses which produce a pulse repetition rate from the transmitter 17 of 15 acoustic pulses per second. Receivers 19 and 20 may be gated alternatively in order to prevent cross feed within the cable 11 as will be readily recognized by thdse skilled in the arts.For example, receiver 19 may be gated on during an interval of from 0.5 to 30 milliseconds subsequent to a first acoustic pulse from transmitter 17. Receiver 19 is then gated off and after the next succeeding pulse from transmitter 17, receiver 20 gated on. For example, receiver 20 may be gated on during a similar interval from 0.5 to 30 milliseconds subsequent to the transmitter output pulse.The logging tool may be moved through the well at any suitble rate while it is operated to generate and receive the acoustic pulses.Typically the tool will be lowered to the bottom of the interval to be logged and then pulled upwardly during the logging measurements at a speed of at least 20 feet per minute. Somewhat greater logging speeds, e.g. 60 feet per minute, normally can be used. At the surface, the uphole circuitry operates on the signals from receivers 19 and 20 to produce signals representative of the travel time between receivers 19 and 20 and the difference in amplitude between the acoustic signals detected by receivers 19 and 20. The circuitry employed for determining the time interval between the acoustic signal arrival at receivers at 19 and 20 may be of any suitable type. For example, the pulses employed to trigger the transmitter may also be applied to a ramp function generator to initiate a signal which increases monotonically with time. For example, the ramp function generator may respond to a triggering pulse to generate a voltage which increases linearly with time. Thus, the amplitude of the voltage is directly proportional to the time following generation of the acoustic signal by transmitter 17. The output from the ramp function generator is applied through gates controlled by the outputs from receivers 19 and 20 to respective voltage storage means. Thus, when an acoustic signal is received at receiver 19, the resulting transducer voltage is applied to open one gate to pass the voltage from the ramp function generator to a first storage means. When the next signal is received by receiver 20, the transducer signal is applied to open another gate to pass the output from the ramp function generator to a second storage means. The two voltage signals are then applied to a difference circuit, the output of which is recorded in correlation with depth to provide a travel time log. The amplitude parameter may similarly be determined through the use of any suitable circuitry.For example, the peak voltage outputs from receivers 19 and 20 may be applied to a difference circuit which produces a voltage which is representative of the difference in the maximum amplitudes of the acoustic signals received by receivers 19 and 20. The output from this difference circuit is then recorded to provide a log of attenuation within the formation.Such analysis and control circuitry is well known to those skilled in the art and for a further description thereof reference is made toU.S. Patent No. 3,191,145. Also, while two receivers are shown it will also be recognized that the logging tool may be equipped with only one receiver in which case a measured parameter may be the travel time between transmitter l7 and the receiver. Preferably however, two receivers as shown will be employed in order to avoid distortion of the measured values due to borehole effects such as changes in the borehole diameter. Typically, the first receiver 19 is spaced 5 to 15 feet from the transmitter with a spacing between adjacent receivers 19 to 20 of 2 to 5 feet. As noted previously, shear wave acoustic pulses are produced by means of a bender type transducer. Bender type transducers are in themselves well known and take the form of an element which responds to an applied electrical field such that its opposed surfaces bend in the same direction in a conforming manner. Thus, the transducer acts as a point source for an acoustic shear wave signal which may be characterized as comprising a positive pressure wave generated in one direction from one surface and a simultaneous negative pressure wave generated in the opposite direction from the other surface.For example, as described by Sheridan, C.A., et al, Bender BarTransducers For Low Frequency Underwater Sound Sources , presented at the 97th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America, Cambridge,Massachusetts, June 15, 1979, Honeywell Defense Electronics Division,Seattle, Washington, August 20, 1979, a suitable bender type transducer may take the form of piezoelectric elements bonded together in a manner such that one side of the transducer is driven in extension while the other side is driven in contraction or is not driven. The result is that both sides of the transducer then bend in a conforming manner in response to an applied voltage. A suitable bender type transducer for use in the present invention is commercially available and is comprised of two piezoelectric discs which are bonded together and encased in a plastic potting compound.The two ceramic discs are reversed in polarity such that one element responds to an applied voltage to expand while the other contracts. The result is that the element flexes in response to each voltage pulse such that one surface is concave and the other is convex. The frequency of the acoustic signal produced by this transducer ranges from about 1 to 6 KHz with a predominant frequency of about 3KHz. The bender tyhpe transducer is mounted such that the opposed flexing surfaces are unrestricted and both are acoustically coupled to the liquid within the wellbore. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate an enlarged view of the transmitter assembly 17 illustrating in detail the bender type transducer and the manner in which it is supported within the logging tool. As shown in Figure 2, upper and lower panels 36 and 37, respectively, define a transducer compartment within the logging tool. Extending between the panels 36 and 37 is a transducer mounting bracket 40 which has an aperture therein which receives the bender type transducer 42. The transducer compartment is provided with a peripheral window 43 which is relatively transparent to acoustic energy. The window 43 may be formed of any suitable material which has an acoustic impedance close to that of the well liquid in order to minimize reflections from the window.The transducer compartment is filled with a suitable coupling liquid as indicated by reference numeral 45 in Figure 3 which also has an acoustic impedance close to that of the liquid within the wellbore. For example, the window 43 may be formed of neoprene rubber and the coupling liquid 45 within the compartment may be a light motor oil. The mounting of the bender type transducer 42 is shown in greater detail in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3, the transducer 42 comprises generally rectangular piezoelectric elements 42A and 42B which are bonded together and encased in a plastic potting compound 42C. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the length, L, of the piezoelectric planar surface or dimension parallel to the center axis of the logging tool is approximately three times greater than its width, W, or dimension perpendicular to the center axis of the logging tool. The transducer 42 is mounted in support 40 by means of a rubber mounting ring 48 in order to reduce the transmission of acoustic energy directly from the transducer to the structural components of the well logging tool. Electrical leads 50 and 52 are bonded to the outer surfaces of elements 42A and 42B, respectively.Leads 50 and 52 extend through panel 36 to a suitable source for a voltage pulse such as a capacitor and inductor circuit which is periodially charged and then discharged in response to a suitable triggering pulse as described above. The use of piezoelectric elements 42A, 42B for the transmitter transducer 42 which are elongated in the direction of the axis of the tool enables lower resonant frequencies to be generated than is possible with circular piezoelectric elements. Thus generation of a resonant frequency of 1KHz would require circular piezoelectric elements having a diameter of approximately six inches, which is too large to be mounted within a logging tool for use in a well borehole having a radial distance of approximately three inches. The bender type transducer described in the preferred embodiment acts as a single point acoustic source and ideally produces a shear wave displacement and radiation pattern of the type disclosed in the aforementioned article by Kitsunezaki. The shear wave amplitude is at a maximum in the plane of the operating faces of the bender type transducer and falls off as a cosine function until it reaches a minimum after displacement through an angle of 900. The compressional wave pattern is 900 out of phase with respect to the shear wave. Thus the compressional wave amplitude is at its maximum along an axis normal to the operating surfaces of the bender type transducer. The receiving transducer or transducers may, in accordance with the broadest aspect of the invention, be of any suitable type.For example, they may take the form of a suspension type geophone detector of the type disclosed in the paper by Kitsunezaki. It is preferred, however, to employ a bender type transducer of the same shape and configuration as the transducer 42 for the reception of the acoustic signal and to orient the receiving transducer such that its opposed operating surfaces are oriented in substantially the same direction as the transmitting transducer. Stated otherwise, the operating surfaces of the transmitting and receiving transducers are located in substantially parallel planes. Since the displacement pattern of the shear wave is a cosine function, some deviation from this standard can be tolerated and still provide a signal response well over 90 of the maximum shear wave amplitude. Where two receiving transducers are employed, both of the receivers should be oriented in the same direction, particularly where the system is operated in an amplitude logging mode, i.e. where attenuation of the signal between the receivers is arrived at by comparing the amplitudes of the signals received at the receivers.
