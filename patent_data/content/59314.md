# Modular merchandise display tower.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a modular tower like structure for displaying merchandise for point of purchase sale. In one form, the basic tower is formed of cylinders of a plastic sheet material, such as clear rigid die cut vinyl plastic, of a thickness enabling it to be collapsed into a relatively flat form for shipping and storage. The sheet plastic tower elements are given as a rigid cylindrical form by means of molded plastic end rings 22 , which are of a channel like cross sectional configuration to lockingly receive the ends of the cylinders 20, 21 . The end rings 22 are of a form and configuration enabling two of them to be bonded in back to back relation, providing a structural interlock between the top of one tower module and the bottom of a second tower module above it. In an alternate form, the lowermost tower element is formed of corrugated board, which has certain structural, practical, and economic advantages in the overall assembly. In any of its forms, the structure is simple, inexpensive, conveniently packaged and shipped, and easily assembled at the display site.
