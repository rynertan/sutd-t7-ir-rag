# SEMICONDUCTOR STRUCTURES HAVING POLYSILOXANE LEVELING FILM

## Abstract
A semiconductor structure comprising a substrate having at least one stepped topographical surface and a polysiloxane dielectric leveling layer disposed on said topographical sur face. The topographical surface can include a layer of metalli zation as well as a layer of glass coating disposed on the metallization layer. The polysiloxane layer has good high temperature stability 450 C and adherence to metal layers and can be readily etched using dry processing.
