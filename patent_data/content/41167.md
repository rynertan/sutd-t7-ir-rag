# Expandable polyolefin compositions and polyolefin foam preparation process.

## Abstract
The use, in an otherwise conventional polyolefin extru sion foaming process, of a stability control agent e.g., stearamide, EAA copolymer, etc. in conjunction with certain mixed blowing agent systems e.g., 5 to 50 weight percent trichloromonofluoromethane and 50 to 95 weight percent dichlorodifluoromethane provides closed cell olefin polymer foam articles having increased maximum achievable cross sections and good dimensional stability.
