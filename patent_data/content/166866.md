# LIGHT DIVERTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A light diverting device for diverting a part of the light energy transmitted through an optical conductor rod and for taking it out. A light diverting device comprised of a first optical conductor rod having a through hole in a radial direction a second and a third optical conductor rod tightly inserted into the through hole, the edge surfaces of the second and third optical conductor rods in the through hole being formed so as to be engaged with the inclined surfaces a fourth optical conductor rod fixed on the outer circumferential surface of the first optical conductor rod so as to cover the inserted portion of the second optical conductor rod. Optical oil is enclosed in a space of the through hole between the inclined surfaces of the second optical conductor rod and that of the third optical conductor rod. A cover member covering the edge portion liquid tightly at the opposite side to the inclined surface of the third optical conductor rod and firmly fixed on the outer circumferential surface of the first optical conduc tor rod.
