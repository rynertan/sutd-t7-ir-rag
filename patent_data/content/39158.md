# INSULATING FOAM BUILDING PANEL AND METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION UTILIZING SUCH PANELS

## Abstract
A heat insulating panel for use in construction of building structures such as a built up roof. The heat insulating panel comprises first and second oppositely disposed surfaces with a core therebetween comprised of phenolic foam material. The first surface of the panel includes a thin layer of reflecting material over substantially the entire surface thereof to reduce the heat conveyed to the core due to sun radiation when the layer of reflecting material on the panel is exposed to sun radiation during construction of the building structure. This reduction in the heat conveyed to the core reduces curl ing or warping of the panel, before application of finishing materials, such as bituminous roofing material, over the panels. There is also disclosed a method of constructing a building structure with such heat insulating panels.
