## Description
METHOD AND DEVICE FOR IGNITING A WELDING ARC FOR AN ARC WELDING APPARATUS The present invention relates to ignition of a welding arc for an arc welding apparatus, and in particular to such ignition by means of a high voltage discharge between a welding electrode with a series connected smoothing coil and a workpiece. In many cases in practice it is not desirable to initiate the welding arc in ordinary manner by touching the workpiece with the welding electrode. In such cases it is common to provide a high voltage discharge across a gap between the welding electrode and the workpiece. This is achieved in actual practice by discharging a charged capacitator e.g. at 1000 volts through a certain portion of a winding on a ferromagnetic core in series with the welding electrode. A high voltage pulse is then induced along the whole extension of the core, and this pulse is discharged between the electrode and the workpiece for spark ignition of the desired welding arc. Such extra iron core with autotransformer winding, partly wound with heavy wire, however raises the costs of the welding apparatus, makes it bulky and contributes to a great extent to an increase of the weight of the apparatus.Furthermore, a charging capacitor implies high voltage and increased needs for isolation inside the apparatus. Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and a device for overcoming the above deficiencies in conjunction with ignition of a welding arc by means of a high voltage discharge between a welding electrode with a series connected smoothing coil and a workpiece. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a method for igniting an arc for a welding apparatus by means of a high voltage discharge between a welding electrode with a series connected smoothing coil and a workpiece, characterized in that an ignition winding with substantially fewer turns than the smoothing coil is inductively coupled with said coil, current being supplied to said winding from a current source and abruptly broken after a predetermined time, in order to induce a high voltage pulse in the smoothing coil and thereby produce a spark ignition of the welding arc by said high voltage discharge. In order to further secure the ignition of the welding arc by the spark discharge, provisions are preferably made.that the current source in synchronism with said abrupt current break is connected and made to supply a current flow through the smoothing coil, the welding electrode and the high voltage discharge, preferably until a changing capacitor of the current source is completely discharged and or thyristors in a main rectifier bridge of the welding apparatus are synchronously triggered. Furthermore, during this procedure the high voltage discharge and the optional current flow from the current source through said discharge are preferably given the same polarity as the intended welding arc In accordance with the invention, there is also provided a device for igniting a welding arc for an arc welding apparatus by means of a high voltage discharge between a welding electrode with a series connected smoothing coil and a workpiece, characterized in that an ignition winding with substantially fewer turns than the smoothing coil is disposed in induction coupling with said coil, switching means and a time controller being provided to switch a current source to supply a current flow through said winding and to break abruptly said current after a predetermined time, in order to induce a high voltage pulse in the smoothing coil and thereby produce a spark ignition of the welding arc by said high voltage discharge. With such method and device according to the invention, only a few lightweight turns on the outside of a smoothing coil, which would otherwise be included in the apparatus in any event, are sufficient to provide the desired hi gh voltage discharge for spark ignition of the welding arc. Also, a high voltage source within the apparatus is not necessary, a s a broken current from a low voltage current source through the ignition winding is sufficient to produce the desired high voltage pulse by induction in the smoothing coil. By additionally bringing current from the low voltage source to flow through the high voltage discharge, a further insurance of arc ignition, which is not provided by prior art, is then achieved by simple means.The invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, the only figure of which showing a connection diagram of a device according to the invention in conjunction with a smoothing coil and a welding electrode of a welding apparatus.The welding apparatus is shown with three phase AC supply to rectifiers and main electronic valves, as well as a decoupling capacitor Ca and a smoothing coil G in series with a welding electrode E, which forms an arc gap against a workpiece A.In order to ignite a welding arc between the electrode E T and the workpiece A, asmall ignition windingtis wound around the smoothing coil G. A capacitor Cl is disposed to be charged by a current from a mains connected rectifier bridgeV1 V4, which is supplied with single phase AC current through series resistors R1 and R2. The capacitor C1 is charged from the rectifier bridge to a moderate voltage of e.g. 65 volts, afld is disposed to be discharged through the ignition windingT by means of a time controller R opening a switching trans . istor V17 for conduction of current a preselected time by applying a corresponding bias voltage to hei he base electrode of the transistor.After said preselected time, which is set in the time controller R, the controller brings the switching transistor to reverse blocking state by applying a corresponding bias voltage to the base electrode of the transistor, thus abruptly breaking the current through the ignition winding T after a conduction time of e.g. 50 During this time the current through the small winding c. . with only four turnsXis increased to 100 150 amperes.By such abrupt break of a comparatively strong current, a voltage of 300 400 volts is obtained in the ignition winding and an induced voltage pulse of more than 6000 volts in the smoothing coil G.The ignition winding of four turns is only a thin wire with a diameter of e.g. t 4 mm, and may quite simply be wound directly on the outside of the smoothing coil. Such a winding implies of course only an insignificant increase of costs and weight compared with the heavy and bulky autotransformer with iron core applied in prior art devices for high voltage ignition of a welding arc. The high voltage impulse produced in the smoothing coil is decoupled against the main electronic valves by means of the capacitorCa and is thus applied almost entirely across the gap between the welding electrode E and the workpiece A, forming a spark in said gap for igniting the arc. The high voltage pulse is brief and ceases after the ignition of the welding arc.In the illustrated embodiment also a further auxiliary winding S, having only two turns, is provided on the smoothing coil. With the abrupt breaking of the current through the ignition winding T a trigger pulse is induced in said auxiliary winding S and applied to the control electrode of a small thyristor V7. This makes the thyristor conducting and enables the discharge of the capacitor C1 through the smoothing coil, welding electrode and high voltage spark at the instant of ignition, with return current path through the workpiece A and the decoupling capacitor Ca. This has an extremely favourable effect in securing certain ignition of the arc. The ignition pulse obtained through abrupt current break in the ignition winding T is brief, and by discharging th e capacitor C1 through the high voltage spark the arc is more easily stabilised. By this also a possible synchronous triggering of the main electronic valves in the apparatus may be achieved.The winding direction of the ignition winding T on the smoothing coil B is such that a high voltage pulse of the same polarity as the intended welding arc is formed with the break of the current through this winding. This is of great importance, as it has been demonstrated that although spark discharge is achieved, ignition of the arc takes place only with difficulty with the opposite winding direction. The component parts shown without labelling or references on the drawing are disposed to provide appropriate bias voltage for the active ignition components, i.e. the time controller R, the switching transistor V17 and the trigger transistorV7. The components connected with the base of the switching transistor V17 also provide fast removal of base current from this transistor, in order thereby to secure a best possible abrupt current break. All this is in accordance with known techniques and forms no part of the present invention.
