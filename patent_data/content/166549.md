# Method for proximity effect correction in electron beam lithography systems.

## Abstract
A method for electron beam lithography writing of a micro miniature pattern P x, y in a resist coated workpiece, the method comprising the steps of calculating, at a plurality of grid points on the workpiece, the electron dosage required to produce uniform exposure of the pattern P in accordance with the expression
