# Fluorimetric method for analysis for bilirubin.

## Abstract
A highly sensitive fluorimetric method for analysis for bilirubin contained in an aqueous liquid comprises a contacting together the aqueous liquid and an inter active, polymeric mordant for bilirubin to mordant bilirubin b thereafter, or during step a , subjecting the mor danted bilirubin to activating radiation effective to excite the mordanted bilirubin and produce detectable fluores cence and c detecting this fluorescence to obtain a determina tion relating to the presence and or concentration of bili rubin in the test sample. The method may be conducted in solution or in a dry test element.
