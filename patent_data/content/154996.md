# Magnetic resonance imaging apparatus using shim coil correction.

## Abstract
In an NMR imaging apparatus 100 , the steady mag netic field H₀ is subjected to be deformed. The first shim coil pair 20 is wound on a common bobbin 40 and has a common diameter 2a . The second shim coil pair 30 is wound on the same bobbin 40 and has the same diameter 2a as that of the first shim coil pair 20 . The first shim coil pair 20 corrects homogeneity of the field components of the steady magnetic field H₀ having even numbered high er order terms in the longitudinal axis Z of the object P under examination. The second shim coil pair 30 corrects uniformity of the magnetic field components of the steady magnetic field H₀ in the direction R perpendicular to the longitudinal axis Z and also uniformity of the magnetic field components of the first coil pair 20 in the direction R perpendicular to the longitudinal axis Z .
