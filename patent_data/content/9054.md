## Description
TITLE OF INVENTION N PYRAZ INECARBONYL N SUBSTITUTED S ULFAMOYL GUANIDINE AND PROCESSES FOR PREPARING SAME.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The background to this invention U.S. Patent 3,313,813 patented April 11, 1967 and issued to Edward J.Cragoe, Jr., shows novel 3 amino 5,6 disubstituted pyrazinoyl guanidine compounds. The compounds of the 813 patent are useful because they possess diuretic and natriuretic properties. They differ from most of the known, effective diuretic agents, however, in that the compounds of the 813 patent selectively enhance the excretion of sodium ions while simultaneously causing a decrease in excretion of potassium ions. The potassium 1088, which is caused by known diuretics, often results in a severe muscular weakness. Since the compounds of the 813 patent prevent the potassium depletion, they have this decided advantage as diuretics.As diuretic agents, they can be used for the treatment of edema, hypertension and other diseases or conditions known to be responsive to this therapy and are especially useful when used in combination with or concomitantly with potassium losing diuretic agents. Applicants instant compounds shown in Formula I subsequently differ from the compounds shown in U.S. Patent 3,313,813, in that they have a sulfamoylguanidino group N C NH2 NH S02NH2 or substituted sulfamoylguanidino group in place of the guanidino group of the compounds in the stated U.S. Patent. Applicants have found that the sulfamoylguanidino group changes the pharmaceutical action and utility of these compounds. It has been found in U.S.Patent 3,313,813 that the pyrazinoylguanidine compounds therein described when co administered with other diuretic agents known to enhance the elimination of potassium ions along with sodium ions, will maintain the potassium ion excretion at approximately the normal or control rate and thus overcome this undesirable property of other diuretic agents. In actuality, applicants compounds in the instant case as further described, accomplish the objective previously achieved by using a combination of the pyrazinoylguanidine compounds of the 3,313,813 patent with diuretic agents which cause elimination of sodium with concomitant excessive potassium elimination. Thus, the effect of introducing a sulfamoyl group to the pyrazinoylguanidine compounds of the 3,313,813 patent results in producing eukalemic saluretic agents. Since the compounds of the instant invention are thus eukalemic saluretic agents they constitute single entities which are useful for the treatment of edema and hypertension and other diseases or conditions known to be responsive to this therapy.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The instant case covers novel N pyrazinecarbonyl N substituted sulfamoyluanidines and processes for making the same. The novel compounds of this invention are depicted in Formula I below. EMI3.1 PORMULA I whereinR1 is hydrogen lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n butyl, n pentyl, cycloalkyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl lower alkenyl having from 2 to 3 carbon atoms such as allyl R2 is hydrogen, lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and n butyl,R1 and R2 can be joined to form, with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, a heterocyclic ring having 3 to 6 carbon atoms therein R3 is hydrogen, lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl and pentyl R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert. butyl and n pentyl cycloalkyl having from 3 to 6 nuclear carbon atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl R5 is hydrogen, lower alkyl having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl and pentyl, cycloalkyl having from 3 to 6 nuclear carbon atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl X is halo such as fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo and the pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts thereof. The preferred compounds of this invention, in other words those having enhanced diuretic, saluretic activity while maintaining unchanged potassium blood levels are those compounds of Formula I whereinR1 R3 hydrogen R2 R4 R5 lower alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms X chloro and the pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts thereof. The compounds of this invention as shown byFormula I and the preferred compounds discussed above are useful because they possess diuretic and natriuretic properties. In addition, they are useful eukalemic saluretics, in other words, the compounds of the instant case cause neither loss or abnormal retention of potassium ions. In contradistinction, the pyrazinoylguanidine compounds ofU.S. Patent 3,313,813 do cause a decrease in the excretion of potassium ions. However, other well known diuretics such as furosemide, chlorthalidone and acetazolamide cause an increase in potassium excretion which often results in muscular weakness. Applicants compounds combine in a single agent the advantages of a combination of the known pyrazinoylguanidine diuretics of U.S. Patent 3,313,813 which decrease potassium with the known diuretics which cause a potassium loss.Thus, the compounds of this invention maintain the excretion of potassium at approximately normal levels while causing an increased renal elimination of sodium ions and water which is the desirable characteristic of the diuretic. Also covered within the scope of the above FormulaI compounds and the preferred compounds are the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. These salts can be made by reacting the free base with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid or isethionic acid. These salts, as stated above, are to be considered as included in this invention. The products of this invention can be administered to patients both human and animal in the form of pills, tablets, capsules, elixirs, injectable preparations and the like. They can be administered either orally or parentally or any other feasible method as known to those skilled in the art such as intravenously or in the form of suppositories and the like. The type of formulation to be administered can be comprised of one or more of the compounds of this invention as the only essential active ingredient of the pharmaceutical formulation. The formulations are merely combinations of the active ingredient mentioned with pharmaceutically inert carriers and the like. The compounds of this invention are advantageously administered at a dosage range of from about 5 mg. to about one gram per day or a somewhat higher or lower dosage at the physician s discre tion, preferably in subdivided amounts on a 2 to 4 tines a day regimen and most preferably at a dosage range from 10 to 500 mg. per day. It will be realized by those skilled in the art that the dosage range for any particular patient animal or human will depend upon the severity of the disease treated, weight of the patient and any other condition which the physician or other person skilled in the art will take account of. The compounds disclosed in this invention inFormula I and the preferred compounds can be formed according to the process described below.EMI6.1 involving a reaction of pyrazinoylguanidine with a sulfamoylchloride to produce the desired product. The reaction is usually run in an inert solvent preferably a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane or aceto nitrile at a temperature from about room temperature to the reflux temperature particularly the reflux temperature of the particular solvent used. The reaction time is usually from one to 48 hours and the reactants are in mole to mole ratios. None of these reaction conditions are critical and they can be varied by those skilled in the art. All the starting materials used in the process described above are shown in and disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,313,813 mentioned previously or at least can be obviously prepared from compounds disclosed in the aforementioned patent.
