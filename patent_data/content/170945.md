# Cut tobacco distributing device for cigarette making machines.

## Abstract
The invention has for its object a cut tobacco distributing device for cigarette making machines. The distributing device includes a rotating drum 2 pro vided with points 3 which takes or receives the cut tobacco. This drum 2 provided with points 3 cooperates with a rotating detaching cylinder 18 which takes the cut tobacco from the said drum 2 . According to the invention, in order to reduce the me chanical stresses which exert a degrading action on the cut to bacco, the points 3 of the drum 2 are retractable inside the drum 2 itself and are controlled by means, e.g. cams 8, 9 which retract them, temporarily, in a complete or almost com plete way in the region of the detaching cylinder 18 . The latter is constructed as a pneumatic suction cylinder without points.
