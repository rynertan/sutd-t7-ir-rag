# Pulsed plasma apparatus and process.

## Abstract
An apparatus for pulsed plasma treatment of a subs trate surface includes means for removing spent gas from a region adjacent the substrate for each pulse. The apparatus may also include means for sweeping an intense plasma region across a substrate surface. Rapid gas exchange is provided by pressure pulsing the gas admission. This facil ity also provides means for rapidly alternating different gases.
