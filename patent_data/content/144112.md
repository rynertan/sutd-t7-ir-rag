## Description
HIGH ENERGY PRODUCT RARE EARTH TRANSITION METAL MAGNET ALLOYS This invention relates to permanent magnet alloys including rare earth elements and transition metal elements.Background British Patent Application No. 2 100 286A entitled High Coercivity Rare Earth Iron Magnets , discloses novel magnetically hard compositions and the method of making them. More specifically, it relates to alloying mixtures of one or more transition metals and one or more rare earth elements. The alloys are quenched from a molten state at a carefully controlled rate such that they solidify with extremely fine.grained crystalline microstructures as determinable by X ray diffraction of powdered samples. The alloys have room temperature intrinsic magnetic coercivities after saturation magnetization of at least about 1,000 Oersteds. The preferred transition meta for the magnet alloys is iron, and the preferred rare earth elements are praseodymium and neocymium. Among the reasons why these constituents are preferred are their relative abundance in nature, low cost and inherently hither magnetic moments. A new family of magnets have now been discovered that have markedly improved properties compared with the above mentioned earlier discovery. It is an object of the subject invention to provide novel magnetically hard compositions based on rare earth elements and iron with extremely fine grained crystal structures having very high r acnetic remanence and energy. products and Curie temperatures well above room temperature. Another object is to create a stable, finely crystalline, magnetically hard, rare earth element and iron containing phase in melted and rapidly quenched alloys so that strong permanent magnets can bye reliably and economically produced. A more specific object is to make magnetically hard alloys by melting and rapidly quenching mixtures of one or more rare earth elements, one or more transition metal elements and the element boron Such alloys exhibit higher intrinsic coercivities and energy products than boron free alloys. A more specific object is to make such high strength magnet alloys from iron, boron and lower atomic weight rare earth elements, particularly neodymium and praseodymium. Another object is to make these magnetically hard alloys by melt spinning or a comparable rapid solidification process. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a novel, stable, rare eartb iron boron, intermetallic, very finely crystalline, magnetic phase. A more particular object is to control the formation of such phase so that the crystallite size appears to be commensurate with optimum single magnetic domain size either by a direct quench or overquench and subsequent heat treatment.Another particular object is to either directly or indirectly create such optimum domain size crystallites in a melt spun or otherwise rapidly quenched RE Fe B alloy, particularly a neodymium or preseodymium iron boron alloy It is a further object to provide a suitable amount of boron in a mixture of low atomic weight rare earth elements and iron to promote the formation of a stable, very finely crystalline, intermetallic phase having high magnetic remanence and energy product. Another particular object is to provide the constituent metallic elements in suitable proportions to form these new intermetallic phases and then process the alloys to optimize the resultant hard magnetic properties.Brief Summary In accordance with a preferred practice of the invention, an alloy with hard magnetic properties is formed having the basic formula RE1 X TKl yBy x. In this formula, RE represents one or more rare earth elements. The rare earth elements include scandium and yttrium in Group IIIA of the periodic table and the elements from atomic number 57 3anthanum through 71 lutetium . The preferred rare earth elements are the lower atomic weight members of the lanthanide series, particularly neodymium and praseodymium. However, substantial amounts of certain other rare earth elements may be mixed with these preferred rare earth elements without destroying or substantially degrading the permanent magnetic properties. TH herein is used to symbolize a transition metal taken from the group consisting of iron or iron mixed with cobalt, or iron and small amounts of such other metals as nickel, chromium or manganese. Iron is preferred for its relatively high magnetic remanence and low cost. A substantial amount may be mixed with iron without adverse effect on the magnetic properties.Nickel, chromium and manganese are also transition metals. However, their inclusion in amounts greater than 10 percent have generally been found to have a deleterious effect on permanent magnetic properties of Nd Fe B alloys. The most preferred alloys contain the rare earth elements Nd and or Pr and the transition metal element, Fe. The superior properties of these light rare earth iron combinations are due, at least in part, to ferromagnetic coupling between the light rare earth elements and Fe. That is, in optimum alloys the orbital magnetic moments L of the rare earths align in the same parallel direction as the spin moments of the iron fS so that the total moment j equals L S. For the heavy rare earth elements such as Er, Tb and Mo, the magnetic coupling is antiferromagnetic and the orbital magnetic moments of the rare earths are antiparallel to the iron spin moment so that the total moment S.The total magnetic moment of the ferromagnetically coupled light rare earth iron alloys is, therefore, greater than that of antiferromagnetically coupled heavy rare earth iron alloys. The rare earth element, samarium, may couple ferro or antiferromagnetically with iron.behaving therefore as both a light and a heavy rare earth element within the context of this invention E is the atomic symbol for the element boron. X is the combined atomic fraction of transition metal and boron present in a sad composition and generally 0.5 x 0.9, and preferably 0.8 x O.s. Y is the atomic fraction of boron present in the composition based on the amount of boron and transition metal present. An acceptable range for y is 0.005 y 0.10, the preferred range being 0.05 y 0.07, B should not be present as more than about 1D atomic percent of the total composition, and preferably less than 7 percent. The incorporation of only a small amount of boron in alloys having suitable finely crystalline microstructures uas found to substantially increase the coercivity of RE Fe alloys at temperatures up to 2000C or greater, particularly those alloys having high iron concentrations. In fact, the alloy 0 2 0.95B0.D5 0.8 exhibited an intrinsic magnetic room temperature coercivity exceeding about 20 kiloOersteds, substantially comparable to the hard magnetic characteristics of much more expensiveSmCo5 magnets. The boron inclusion also substantially improved the energy product of the alloy and increased its Curie temperature. Permanent magnet alloys in accordance with the invention were made by mixing suitable weight portions of elemental forms of the rare earths, transition metals and boron The mixtures were arc melted to form alloy ingots. The alloy was in turn remelted in a quartz crucible and expressed through a small nozzle onto a rotating chill surface. This produced thin ribbons of alloy. The process is generally referred to in the art as melt spinning and is also described in United States Serial No.274,040. In melt spinning, the quench rate of the melt spun material can be varied by changing the linear speed of the quench surface. By selection of suitable speed ranges products were obtained that exhibited high intrinsic magnetic coercivities and remanence. Furthermore, it was found that products with such properties could be produced either as directly quenched from the melt, or as overquenched and annealed as will be described hereinafter. In each case where good magnetic properties were obtained, the magnetic material comprised very small crystallites about 20 to 400 nanometers average diameter apparently sized near the optimum single magnetic domain size or smaller. The fairly uniform shape of the crystallites as exhibited by scanning electron microscopy suggest a crystal structure that is fairly uniform in all directions such as a tetragonal or cubic structure. MZthematical modeling based on neutron.diffraction data strongly suggests a tetragonal crystal structure where a 8.8 angstroms and c 12.2 angstroms. The nominal composition of the magnetic phase is believed to be RE2Fe14B1 e.g. RE.37Fe.72B.01 approximate atomic weight fraction RE.12Fe.82B.06 approximate atomic fractions , where RE is neodymium and or praseodymium. As will be substantiated hereinafter, this crystal phase is not destroyed by substituting limited amounts of other rare earths and transition metals for the preferred constituent elements.Alloys of such structure constitute a heretofore unknown magnetic phase. The inclusion of boron in suitable amounts to mixtures of rare earth elements and iron was found to promote the formation of a stabile, hard magnetic phase over a fairly broad range of quench rates.The magnetic remanence and energy product of all melt spun, magnetically hard, boron containing, RE iron alloys were improved with respect to boron free compositions. The Curie temperatures of the alloys were substantially elevated. The invention will be better understood in view of the following detailed description.Detailed DeEcriPtion Figure 1 is a plot of room temperature intrinsic coercivity for magnetized melt spunNd0.4 Fe1 yBy 0.6 alloys as a function of the linear speed V5 of the quench surface.

This invention relates to making improved magnetically hard rare earth transition metal compositions incorporating small amounts of the element boron.

As it relates to this invention, melt spinning entails mixing suitable weight portions of the constituent elements and melting them together to form an alloy of a desired composition. Arc melting is a preferred technique for experimental purposes because it prevents any contamination of the alloys from the heating vessel. In the following examples, alloy ingots were broken into chunks small enough to fit inside a spin melting tube crucible or tundi h made of quartz. Ceramic, or other suitable refractory materials could be used. Each tube had a small orifice in its bottom through which an alloy could be ejected. The top of the tube was sealed and provided with means for containing pressurized gas in the tube above a molten alloy. A heating coil was disposed around the portion of the tube containing the alloy to be melt spun. When the coil was activated, the chunks of alloy within the tube melted and formed a fluid mass. An inert gas was introduced into the space above the molten alloy at a constant positive pressure to eject it through the small orifice at a constant rate. The orifice was located only a short distance from a chill surface on which the molten metal was rapidly ccsoled and solidified into ribbon form. The surface was the outer perimeter of a rotating copper disc plated with chromium although other chill surfaces and materials such as molybdenum having high thermal conductivity may also be acceptable. The disc was rotated at a constant speed so that the relative velocity between the ejected alloy and the chill surface was substantially. constant.However, the rate at which a quench surface moves may be varied throughout a run to compensate for such factors as the heating of the quench surface varied alloy melt temperature or to create a desired microstructure in the ribbon. Herein, the disc speed V5 is the speed in metres per second of a point on the chill surface of the melt spinner 6 quench disc as it rotates at a constant rotational velocity. Because the chill disc is much more massive than the alloy ribbon, it acts as an infinitely thick heat sink for the metal that solidifies on it. The disc may be cooled by any suitable means to prevent heat build up during long runs The terms melt spinning or melt spun as used herein refer to the process described above as well as any like process which achieves a like result. The principal limiting factor for the rate of chill of a ribbon of alloy on the relatively cooler disc surface is its thickness. If the ribbon is too thick, the metal most remote from the chill surface will cool too slowly and crystallize in a magnetically soft state. If the alloy cools very quickly, the ribbon will have a microstructure that is somewhere between almost completely amorphous and very, very finely crystalline. Overguenched melt spun ribbons have low intrinsic magnetic coercivity, generally less than a few hundred Gersteds. If they are amorphous, sized completely glassy, they cannot be later annealed to achieve magnetic properties comparable to an alloy directly quenched at the optimum rate. However, if an alloy is cooled at a slightly slower rate than that which produces a glass, an incipient micro crystal line structure seems to develop. The slightly overquenched alloy has low coercivity as formed but has the capacity to develop a near optimum microcrystalline hard magnetic phase. That is, a controlled rapid anneal of a partially overquenched alloy can promote the development of a finely crystalline hard magnetic phase.This phase appears to be the same as that present in the best directly quenched, boron containing alloy ribbon. in all of the following examples, a melt spinning apparatus of the type described above was used to make ribbons of the novel magnetic composi tions. The quartz tube for Examples 1, 2, 4 P, 12 20 and 23 24 was about 100 mm long and 12.7 mm in diameter. About 4 grams of alloy chunks were added to the tube for each run. The ejection orifice was round and about 500 microns in diameter, and an argon ejection pressure of about 34.47 kPa 5 psi was used. For the remaining examples, the quartz tdbe was about 127 irrn long and about 25 rim in diarreter. About 25 40 grams of alloy chunks were added to the tube for each run. The ejection orifice was round and about 675 microns in diameter. An argon ejection pressure of about 20.68 kPa 3.0 psi was used,In each case, the orifice was located about 3.1 mn to 6.3 rtrn 1 8 to 1 4 inches fran the chill surface of the cooling disc. The disc was initially at room temperature and was not externally tooled, The resultant melt spun ribbons were about 30 50 microns thick and about 1.5 millimetres wide. The critical element of the melt spinning process is the controlled quenching of the molten alloy to produce the desired very fine crystalline microstructure. While melt spinning is a preferred method of making the subject boron enhanced RE TZ magnet materials, other comparable methods may be employed. X ray data supports the hypothesis that the hard magnetic phase is, in fact, very finely crystalline. Scanning electron microscopy results indicate that the optimum average crystallite size is between about 20 and 400 nanometers. It is believed that such small crystallite size is nearly commensurate with optimum single domain size for the subject RE Fe B alloys.Compositions The magnetic compositions of this invention are formed from molten homogeneous mixtures of certain rare earth elements, transition metal elements and boron. The rare earth elements include scandium and yttrium in group IIIA of the period table as well as the lanthanide series elements from atomic No. 57 lanthanum through atomic No. 71 lutetium . In order to achieve the desired high magnetic coercivities for the subject magnet compositions, it would appear that the f orbital of the preferred rare earth constituent elements or alloys should not be empty, full or half full. That is, there should not be zero, seven or fourteen electrons in the f orbital of the alloyed rare earth constituent. The preferred rare earth elements for use in this invention are two lower atomic weight members of the lanthanide series, neodymium and praseodymium.These elements are also commonly referred to as light rare earth elements. Nd and Pr are among the most abundant, least expensive, and have the highest magnetic moments of the light rare earths. The elements Nd and Pr also couple ferromagnetically with iron total moment,EMI18.1 It is usually possible to substitute rare earth elements for one another in the crystal lattice of an alloy. For example, if the atomic radius of a rare earth element is critical to the behavior and micrographic structure of an alloy in which it is mixed with a transition metal, by the substitution of two different rare earth elements with a suitable average atomic radius e.g., one with a greater atomic radius and one with a smaller radius , one may produce an alloy with like crystallographic structure. Therefore, it may be possible to substitute controlled amounts of other rare earth elements forPr and Nd in our alloys. Bowever, the heavier rare earth elements such as terbium, holmium, dysprosium, erbium and thulium couple anti ferromagnetically with iron. Therefore, these heavy rare earth containing iron alloys would not be expected to produce permanent magnets as strong as Nd Fe and Pr Fe alloys. The elements iron, nickel, cobalt, chromium, copper and manganese are transition metals. In the practice of this invention, iron is a necessary and preferred constituent. Moreover, it is rfatively abundant in nature, inexpensive and inherently high in magnetic remanence. Cobalt may be substituted for a portion of this iron. While small amounts of the other transition metals may not interfere severely with the permanent magnetic properties of the subject alloys, they have not been found to augment the permanent magnetic properties either. Boron was used in elemental form in all cases as were the rare earth and transition metal elements. However, alloyed forms of boron and the other elements may be egually suited. Small amounts of other elements may be present so long as they do not significantly deteriorate the magnetic properties of the compositions. The relative amounts of RE, TM and B alloyed together are expressed herein in terms of atomic fractions or percents. A distinction is made herein between atomic fractions and atomic weight fractions. For example, one atomic weight unit of the composition having the atomic fraction formulaNd0.4 Fe0.95B0.05 0.6 would comprise by weight 0.4 x atomic wt. Nd 0.4 x 144.24 57.696 g Nd 0.6 x 0.95 x ataaic wt. Fe 0.57 x 55.85 31.835 g Fe 0.6 x 0.05 x ataxic wt.B a 0.03 x 10.81 0.324 g B 89.855 g total which expressed as weight fractions or weight percents of the constituents is wt. fraction wt. percent Nd 57.696 89.855 a 0.642 64.2 Fe 31.835 89.855 0.354 35.4 B 0.324 89.855 w 0.004 0.4The preferred compositional range for the subject hard magnet alloys of this invention is about 10 to 20 atomic percent rare earth elements with the balance being transition metal elements and a small amount less than about 10 and preferably less than about 7 atomic percent total boron. Bigher percentages of the rare earth elements are possible but may adversely affect the magnetic energy product.Small amounts of other elements may be present so long as they do not materially adversely affect the practice of the invention. The invention will be better understood in view of the following examples. Example 1 Referring to Figure 1, alloys of neodymium and iron were made by mixing substantially pure commercially available forms of the elements in suitable weight proportions. The mixtures were arc melted to form alloy ingots. The amount of neodymium was maintained in each alloy at an atomic fraction of 0.4. The iron and boron constituents together made up an atomic fraction of 0.6. The atomic fraction of boron, based on the amount of iron present was varied from 0.01 to 0.03. Each of the alloys was melt spun by the method described above. The quench rate for each alloy was changed by varying the surface velocity of the quench wheel. About four grams of ribbon were made for each sample. The intrinsic coercivity cf each of the alloys for this and the other examples was determined as follows. The alloy ribbon was first pulverized to powder with a roller on a hard surface. Approximately 100 mg of powder was compacted in a standard cylindrical sample holder for the magnetometer, The sample was then magnetized in a pulsed magnetic field of approximately 45 kiloO rsteds. This field is not believed to be strong enough to reach magnetic saturation M5 of the subject alloys but was the strongest available for the work. The intrinsic coercivity measurements were made on a PrincetonApplied Research vibrating sample magnetometer with a maximum operating field of 19 koe. Magnetization values were normalized to the density of the arc melted magnet material. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the intrinsic coercivity Hci is dependent both on quench rate a function of V and boron content.The highest overall intrinsic coercivities were achieved for the neodymium iron alloy containing the most boron 3 percent based on iron. Lesser percentages of boron improved the intrinsic coercivity of the composition over boron free alloy.The optimum substrate velocity appeared to be about 7.5 metres per second for the small quartz tube with the 500 micron ejection orifice and an ejection pressure of about 34 47 kPa 5 psi . Intrinsic coercivites were lower for wheel speeds below 5 metres per second and above 15 metres per second. Example 2 Figure 2 is a plot of intrinsic magnetic coercivity versus substrate quench speed for alloys of neodymium and iron where neodymium comprises 25 atomic percent of the alloy. The samples were made and tested as in Example 1. Clearly, the inclusion of boron in amounts of three and five atomic percent based on iron content greatly improved the intrinsic room temperature coercivity for these alloys.Without boron, this high iron content alloy does not show very high intrinsic coercivity 2.3 kOe maximum . It appears that the inclusion of even a small amount of boron can create high intrinsic magnetic coercivity in certain alloys where it would otherwise not be present.The Ndo 25fFeO 95Bo o o 75 alloy 3.75 atomic percent B achieved an Hci of 19.7 kOe comparable, e.g., to the intrinsic coercivities of rare earth cobalt magnets, Example 3 Figure 3 is a plot of intrinsic room temperature coercivity as a function of quench velocity for melt spun ribbons of Ndo 5fFel yBy O 85 alloy, wherein the fraction of boron with respect to iron was 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09. In this example, the alloy was melt spun from the larger quartz tube having an orifice diameter of about 675 microns at an ejection pressure of about 20.68 kPa 3 psi argon.The maximum coercivity was achieved for y 0.07 at a quench surface velocity of about 17.5 metres per second.The maximum intrinsic coercivity for y 0.05 and 0.09 were both lower than y 0.07. The 0.09 also had a narrower window of quench rates over which the high coercivity magnetic phase formed. The inclusion of 0.03 boron increased the intrinsic coercivity of the alloy as compared to that with no boron, but the highest value of intrinsic coercivity was substantially lower than that for higher boron content alloys. Example 4 Figure 4 is a plot of intrinsic room temperature coercivity as a function of quench velocity for melt spun alloy ribbons of neodymium, iron and boron where the Nd content wes varied from 10 to 30 atomic percent and the ratio of iron to boron is held constant at 0.95 to 0.05. The maximum coercivity achieved for the ten atomic weight percent neodymium alloy was only about 6 kiloOersteds. For 15 atomic percent neodymium the maximum intrinsic coercivity achieved was about 17 Ki oOersteds. For all other neodymium contents, however, the maximum intrinsic coercivity was at least 20 kiloOersteds. The optimum quench velocity for these alloys appeared to be in the 10 to IS metre per second range. Example 5 Figure 5 is a plot of remanent magnetization Br measured at room temperature for melt spun neodymium iron alloys as a function of substrate quench speed. For the high iron content alloys there is clearly a critical substrate quench velocity beyond which the magnetic remanence of the material falls off rapidly. At substrate quench speeds less than 20 metres per second, all of the neodymium alloys showed remanent magnetization values of at least 4 kiloGauss. Increasing the Fe concentration results in an appreciable increase in remanent magnetization from a maximum of 4.6 kG at X 0.67 to 8.0 kG for X 0.9. A carefully controlled, rapid anneal of overquenched ribbon V5 20 m s, e.g. can be affected as will be described hereinafter to induce coercivity and remanence commensurate with optimally quenched alloy. Example 6 Figure 6 is a demagnetization curve for melt spun Nd0.25 Fe0.25B0.05 0.75 for several different substrate chill velocities. The relatively square hysteresis loop characterized by the relatively flat demagnetization curves in the second quadrant for V 7.5 and V 10 metres per second is 5 5 desirable for many hard magnet applications as it results in higher energy products. Example 7 Figure 7 shows demagnetization curves for melt spun Nd0.2 Fe0.96B0.04 0.8 alloy as a function of the initial magnetizing field. The curve is substantially lower for the 19 kilooersted magnet izing field than the 45 kilooersted field. As noted in Example 1, it is possible that higherremanencemag netization and HCi could be achieved for the subject RE Fe B compositions given a stronger magnetizing field strong enough to induce magnetic saturation. Example 8 Figure 8 shows demagnetization curves for melt spun 25 atomic percent neodymium iron alloys.The addition of 0.03 and 0.05 atomic fractions boron based on iron content served to substantially flatten and extend the demagnetization curves for this alloy indicating higher energy products. Higher boron levels than those shown in Figure 7, e.g., y 0.07, result in small additional increases in coercivity but remanent magnetization drops, resulting in lowered energy product. Generally, not much benefit in intrinsic coercivity is gained and a loss of energy product may occur by adding too much boron based on the total composition to a melt spun rare earth iron alloys. Excess boron also seems to narrow the window of quench rates over which the desired magnetic phase forms directly See Figure 3, e.g. . Experimental evidence indicates that a concentration of boron above about 5 6 total atomic percent exceeds the boron concentration equilibrimm of the magnetic RE Fe B intermetallic phase upon which the hard magnetic properties of these materials are based. While excess boron will not destroy the magnetic phase at concentrations up to and even exceeding 10 atomic percent, boron concentrations over about 6 atomic percent do dilute the magnetic properties of the alloys.The inclusion of boron in an amount of about 5 6 percent or less, however, stabilizes the formation of a crystalline intermetallic magnetic phase which forms into a very finely crystalline, magnetically hard microstructure during the quench. Excess boron, above 5 6 atomic percent, appears to promote the formation of magnetically soft Fe B glasses. Example 9 Figure 9 shows the intrinsic room temperature coercivity for PrO 4FeO 6 andPr0.4 Fe0.95B0.05 0.6 The addition of a small amount of boron, here three percent of the total composition was found to improve the intrinsic coercivity of praseodymium iron compounds from roughly 6.0 to over 16 kOe at quench velocities of about 7.5 metres per second. While neodymium iron systems have been extensively examined, other rare earth and transition metal alloys containing boron and processed in accordance with the subject invention will exhibit permanent magnetic properties as will be described by example hereinafter. Example 10 Figures 11 and 12 show the properties of Ndix Fe0.95B0.05 x alloys. The samples were ejected from the 675 micron capillary onto a quench wheel moving at the near optimum speed of V 15 m s. Figure 11 shows the energy product BH , the magnetic remance Br and the inductive coercivity H for the several neodymium contents. The remanence, c coercivity and magnetic energy product all peak at an x the total atomic fraction of Fe and B approximately egual to 0.86. An energy product of 14.1 mg Oe was achieved which is nearly commensurate with the energy product of oriented samarium cobalt magnets. Figure 12 shows intrinsic coercivity HCi. Maximum Bci was achieved at about X 0.75. Figure 13 is a scanning electron micrograph of the transverse fracture surface of a ribbon sample of the 14.1 megaGauss Oersted direct quenched alloy.The micrographs were taken near the quench surface, i.e., that surface which impinges the quench wheel in the melt spinning process at the center of the ribbon cross section and at the free surface, i.e.that surface farthest from the quench wheel. It has been found that those magnetic materials exhibiting substantially uniform crystallite size across the thickness of the ribbon tend two exhibit better permanent magnetic properties than those showing substantial variation in crystallite size throughout the ribbon thickness. The directly quenched material of Figure 13 appears to consist of fine crystallites which range in size from approximately 20 to 50 nanometers. This crystallite size is probably close to an optimum single magnetic domain size. Figure 14 shows the demagnetization behavior for the 14.1 megaGauss Oersted directly quenched magnet material. The relatively high remanence of about 8.2 kG contributes substantially to the high energy product B x H . Example 11 Figure 15 shows the effect of varying the neodymium content Nd1 x Fe0.95B0.05 x alloys on the second quadrant demagnetization curve. The samples were ejected from the 675 micron capillary at a near optimum quench wheel speed of V 15 m s. For S neodymium contents of less than about 10 percent, the inductive coercivity H is less than about 7 kilo Gersteds. The highest remanence is achieved for neodymium contents of approximately 15 to 13.4 atomic percent. Higher neodymium contents, X r 0.8 and X 0.75 have a tendency to reduce the magnetic remanence but increase the intrinsic coercivity of directly quenched alloy.From this information, it has been hypothesized that the near optimum composition for neodymium iron boron alloys contain approximately 14 percent neodymium. However, there may be substantial latitude in these compositions depending on what one desires to achieve in ultimate magnetic properties.Moreover, certain amounts of other rare earth metals may be substituted for neodymium which will be described hereinafter. Example 12 Figure 16 shows demagnetization curves for melt spun Nd033 Fe095B005 067 as a function of temperature. The samples were. remagnetized in the pulsed 45 kOe field between temperature changes.Elevated temperatures have some adverse effect on the remanent magnetization of these materials. Experimental evidence indicates that approxiately 40 percent of the Hci may be lost between temperatures of 400 and 500 C. This is generally comparable to the losses experienced by mischmetal samarium cobalt, and SmCo5 magnets at like temperatures. Given the high initial Hci of the Present alloys, however, in many applications such losses may be tolerated. Example 13 Figure 17 shows demagnetization curves for melt spun Nd0.15 Fe0.95B0.05 0.85 as a funetion of temperature. When compared to Figure 10, it is clear tbat higher atomic percentages of iron tend to improve the magnetic remanence and, hence, energy product of the subject alloys at elevated temperatures. Example 14 Figure 18 shows a normalized plot of the log of intrinsic coercivity as a function of temperature for three different neodymium iron boron alloys. In the higher iron content alloy, intrinsic coercivity decreases less rapidly as a function of temperature than in the higher neodymium fraction containing compounds. Example 15 Figure 19 shows the value of magnetic remanence as a function of temperature in degreesKelvin for Ndix Fe0.95B0.05 x alloys whereX 0.85, 0.80, 0.67 and for Nd0.4 Fe0.97B0.03 0.6.Again, the higher iron content alloys show higher remanence at elevated temperatures. Example 16 Figure 20 shows magnetization dependence of melt spun Nd0.25 Fe1 yBy 0.75 on or temperature. The higher boron content alloys showed a dip in the magnetization curve at temperatures between about 10D and 300 Kelvin. The reason for this apparent anomaly is not currently understood. The Curie temperature Tc was substantially elevated by the addition of boron T 453t K for no boron and c 533 K with 3.75 atomic percent boron IY 0,05 , Figure 20 shows the effect of adding boron on Curie temperature for several neodymium iron boron alloys. Example 17 Figure 21 shows the effect of varying the amount of neodymium in a neodymium iron boron alloy on magnetization of melt spun samples at temperatures between 0 and 600t K. The dip between 100 and 300 Kelvin is noted in all of the curves although the high iron content alloy magnetization curve is substantially flatter in that temperature range thar. the higher neodymium content alloys. Example 18 Figure 22 shows x ray spectra CuK alpha of Nd0.15 Fe1 yBy 0.85 Y 0.00, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09 alloy samples ejected from 675 micron orifice onto a quench wheel moving at Vs 15 m s. The selected samples exhibited maximum intrinsic coercivity for each boron level. The data X ray were taken from finely powdered specimens over a period of several hours. The x ray intensity units are on an arbitrary scale. The boron free alloy X ray spectra includeBragg reflections corresponding to the neodymium and Nd2Fel7 phases, neither of which is believed to account for even a limited amount of coercivity in these alloys since the highest Curie temperature of either Na or Nd2Fel is only 331 K. X ray data indicate that the inclusion of boron in Nd0.15 Fe1 yBy 0.85 .where 0.03 y C 0.05, stabilizes a Nd Fe B intermetallic phase. This phase is believed to be responsible for the permanent magnetic properties.Its Curie temperature is well above that of any other known Nd Fe compounds. Example 19 Figure 23 compares the x ray spectra of the quenched surface of an Nd0.25 Fe0.95B0.05 0.75 alloy ribbon to the free surface. The quenched surface is defined as that surface of the ribbon which impinges on the cooling substrate. The free surface is the opposite flat side of the ribbon which does not contact the cooling substrate. Clearly, the free surface sample shows more crystallinity than the quenched surface. This may be explained by the fact that the free surface cools relatively slower than the quenched surface allowing more time for crystallographic ordering of the elements. Example 20 Figure 24 displays differential scanning calorimetry data for optimum directly quenchedNd0.25 Fe1 yBy .75 which alloys exhibit maximum coercivity from Figure 2. The data were taken at a heating rate of 80V K per minute. The addition of boron clearly increases the crystalline character and reduces the amorphous or glass like characteristics of these optimum melt spun alloys. This was not expected as boron is known to promote glass formation in some other compositions, e.g. Fe8132 . The Y 0.05 alloys appear to have a particularly crystalline nature as indicated by the absence of any increased apparent specific heat ASH release up to 10000 K.The sharp elevation in ASH at9400 K is believed to be associated with partial melting of the alloy. Example 21 Figure 25 displays differential scanning calorimetry data for Nd0.15 Fe1 yBy 0.85 alloys y 0.0, 0.05 and 0.09 quenched at V 15 mls S and 30 m s. X ray data for the 15 m s alloys are shown in Figure 16. The DSC tracings of all of the V 15 m s alloys, which are close to the optimum 5 quench, are relatively flat, confirming the predominantly crystalline charater indicated by the X ray data. In contrast, all of the V 30 m s 5 alloys for y 0.05 and 0.09 exhibit large increases in apparent specific heat in the vicinity of 850 SD0 K, indicating that randomly arranged atoms in the alloys undergo crystallization in the temperature range.X ray patterns of the alloy before heating also indicate glass like or amorphous behavior, exhibiting a single broad peak centered at 20 40 . In contrast, the DSC and X ray data for the y 0.0 boron free alloy was little changed between V 15 and 30 mIs. Moreover, no large increase in 5 apparent specific heat occurred above 9000K. Boron is necessary to achieve a microstructure in an overquenched alloy which can be later annealed to a magnetically hard state. Without boron, one cannot anneal an overquenched alloy to a magnetically hard state. This is because the Nd Fe B phase is not present. Example 22 Figure 26 shows typical demagnetization curves for various permanent magnet materials and lists values for their maximum energy products.Clearly, only SmCo5 shows slightly better room temperature magnetic properties than the subject neodymium iron boron compositions. Bonded SmCo5 powder magnets are substantially weaker. It is believed that the subject RE TM B compositions could be used in high quality, high coercivity, hard magnet applications at substantially less cost than orientedSmCo5 magnets both because of the lover cost of the constituent elements and easier processing. The subject hard magnet compositions have much better properties than conventional manganese aluminiumcarbon, Alnico, and ferrite magnets. Example 23 Figure 27 shows that adding boron to ND1 X Fel B alloys substantially elevates the l y y x apparent Curie temperatures of the alloys. So far as practical application of the subject invention is concerned, increased Curie temperature greatly expands the possible uses for these improved hard magnet materials. For example, magnets with Curie temperatures above about 5000K 237 C could be used in automotive underhood applications where temperatures of 1500 C may be encountered. The data points which are blacked in inFigure 27 particularly show the substantial increase in Curie temperature provided by adding 5 percent boron based on the iron content of the neodymium iron melt spun alloys having less than 40 atomic percent neodymium. Like alloys without boron added to them showed a marked tendency to lowered apparent Curie temperature in alloys containing less than 40 atomic percent neodymium. That is, including boron not only elevates Curie temperature but does so at relatively lower rare earth concentrations. Thus, adding boron to suitable substantially amorphous RE TM alloys increases intrinsic magnetic coercivity and Curie temperature at relatively high iron concentrations. These results are very desirable. Example 24 Experiments were conducted on iron rich alloys to determine whether comparable hard magnet characteristics could be induced in the subject RE TH B compositions by annealing magnetically soft substantially amorphous forms of the alloy. Refer ring to Figure 28, a representative alloy ofNd0.15 Fe0.95B0.05 0.85 was melt spun onto a chill disc having a surface velocity V of 30 metres per 5 second. The ribbon so produced was amorphous and had soft magnet characteristics indicated by the sharp slope of its demagnetization curve no anneal, V 5 30 m s, line in Figure 28 . When this ribbon was annealed at about 850 K for about 15 minutes the maximum magnetic coercivity increased to about 10.5 kOe and the alloy exhibited hard magnetic character istics. When a like Nd Fe B alloy was melt spun and quenched in like manner on a chill disc having a surface velocity of V5 15 metres per second, an amorphous to finely crystalline alloy was produced with an intrinsic room temperature coercivity of about 17 kOe no anneal, V5 , 15 mix, line in Figue 28 , much higher than that of the alloy quenched at Vs 30 either before or after annealing. When the alloy melt spun at V 15 metres per second was 5 annealed at about 850t K, its intrinsic coercivity dropped to levels nearly matching those of the annealed V 30 samples. s Example 25 An alloy of of Nd0.14 F.e.95B0.05 0.86 was prepared by ejecting a 25 gram sample of molten alloy from a quartz crucible onto the perimeter of a chromium plated copper disc rotating at a speed V 30 metres per second. The orifice size was S approximately 670 micron metres and the ejection pressure was approximately 20.68 kPa 3.0 psi argon. This produced overquenched alloys with virtually no hard magnetic properties. The line marked no anneal on Figure 29 shows the coercivity and remanence of the alloy as melt spun. The melt spun ribbon was coarsely crushed znd samples weighinc approximately 60 milligrams each were weighed out. The subsequent heating or annealing regimen was carried out under one atmosphere of flowing argon in a Perkin Elmer DSC ii differential scanning calorimeter. The calorimeter was initially at room temperature with the temperature being raised at a rate of 160 K per minute up to a peak temperature of 950 K. The samples were cooled to room temperature at the same rate. The demagnetization data were taken on a magnetometer after first magnetizing the samples in the pulsed field of about 40 kiloGauss. Figure 29 shows second quadrant demagnetization curves for the samples as a function of how long they were maintained at the peak anneal temperature of 950 e K. The line marked 0 min. represents the magnetic characteristics of a sample elevated to 950 K at the ramp rate of 1600 K per minute and then immediately cooled to room temperature at the same rate of 1600K per minute. The curves for 5, 10 and 30 minutes refer to maintaining the samples at the 950e K peak temperature for periods of 5, 10 and 30 minutes at heating and cooling ramp rates of 1600K per minute. It is clear from this data that holding a sample at an elevated temperature of 950 C for any substantial period of time adversely affects the magnetic strength of the annealed alloy. As the best magnetic properties were obtained for the samples which were rapidly annealed and then rapidly cooled, it appears that the speed of the annealing process is significant to the formation of the desired hard magnetic properties in the alloys. While a rapid convection heating is effective. in creating the permanent magnetic phase in the rare earth iron boron alloys, other processes such as mechanically w orki r or hot pressing overquenched alloys could also promote the formation of the very finely crystalline permanent magnetic phase. Example 26 A Nd0.14 Fe0.95B0.05 0.86 alloy was melt spun at quench wheel speeds V 27.5 and 30 5 This. The samples were annealed in a differential scanning calorimeter at heating and cooling ramp rates of 40. and 1600K per minute. The alloy quenched at V 27.5 m s exhibited higher remanence than S the V 30.0 m s alloy. For both values of V , 5 the sample annealed at the higher ramp rate of 1600K per minute showed higher second quadrant remanence and coercivity than those annealed at the 400K per minute ramp rate. Thus, rapid heating and low time at maximum temperature appear to promote formation of crystallites in the desired size range between about 20 and 200 nanometers.Over annealing probably cause excess crystal growth and the creation of larger than optimum single domain sized particles.Excessive crystal growth, such as that brought about by extended anneal see Figure 29, e.g. tends to degrade magnetic strength. Example 27 Figure 31 shows a plot of maximum energy product for Nd0.135 Fe0.946 B0,054 0.865 alloy. The circular open data points represent energy products for alloy directly quenched at the quench wheel speeds V indicated on the X axis. The other data 5 points represent the maximum energy product for alloy quenched at the V indicated on the X axis and then 5 annealed in a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating and cooling ramp rate of 16Q K per minute to maximum temperatures of 1000, 975 and 9500K respectively. A maximum energy product of 14.1 megaGaussOersted was reached for the alloy directly quenched at an approximate wheel speed of 19 m s. The alloy directly quenched at wheel speeds greater than about 20.5 metres per second shows rapidly decreasing energy product with quench wheel speed. At about V 30 metres per second, the alloy as quenched 5 has substantially no energy product. The solid round, triangular and square data points represent the measured maximum energy products for the alloy quenched at the corresponding V on the X axis S after they have been annealed to maximum temperatures of 1000, 975 and 9500K, respectively. The annealing steps were conducted in a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating and cooling ramp rate of 1600K per minute.It is evident from Figure 31, that the alloy can be overquenched and then annealed back to produce a form of the alloy with high magnetic energy product. This is a strong support for the hypothesis that the phase responsible for the permanent magnetic properties in the alloy is finely crystalline and is probably commensurate with optimum single domain size. The overquenched alloy, i.e., in this case those melt spun ribbons quenched at a wheel speed greater than about 20 metres per second would either be completely amorphous o have crystallites or particle sizes in their microstructures smaller than optimum single magnetic domain size. The heating step is believed to promote the growth of the crystallites or particles within the microstructure to achieve the near optimum single domain size. Surprisingly, the size of the crystallites after a rapid heating to 9500K is fairly uniform throughout the ribbon thickness. Figure 32 shows the second quadrant magnetization curves for the alloy of Figure 31 as directly quenched at the indicated wheel speeds. Figure 33 shows X ray diffraction patterns for these alloys as they come off the quench wheel at the indicated wheel speeds. It is apparent from these X ray spectra that increasing the wheel speed decreases the occurrence of specific peaks and creates a much more amorphous looking pattern. The pattern for V 35 m s is S characteristic of an amorphous, glassy substance.Annealing any of the alloys in accordance with the regimen described with respect to Figure 31 creates an X ray diffraction pattern similar to that for V 19 m s of Figure 33. However, much better 5 magnetic properties are observed for suitably annealed samples which initially show some incipient crystallization like V 21.7 m s in Figure 33. 5 Annealing amorphous alloy with a glassy X ray pattern e.g. V 35 in Figure 33 creates permanent 5 magnetic properties but the remanence is lower. A comparison was made between the second quadrant magnetic characteristics of theNd0.135 Fe0.946B0.054 0.865 alloy originally quenched at wheel speeds of 20.5 m s Figure 35 to alloy quench at wheel speeds of 35 mIs Figure 36 . The slightly overquenched material V5 .20.5 m s showed magnetic remanence over 8 kiloGauss and coercivity over 12 kiloDersteds and a maximum energy product of 13.7 megaGauss Oersted. On the other hand, the grossly overquenched alloy Vs 35 m s showed maximum magnetic remanence below 8 megaGaussOersted. The maximum energy product for the greatly overquenched Ys 35 m s alloy was 11.9 megaGauss S Oersted. Figure 34 shows differential scanning calorimeter traces for the alloys of Figure 31 quenched at wheel speed V 19, 20.5 and 35 mis. S That quenched at metres per second representing the optimum direct quenched alloy shows a decrease in apparent specific heat ASH at about 5750K and then a slight increase in ASH up to the maximum operating temperature available of the DSC 100 K . The alloy,that was overquenched slightly at a V 20.5 5 m s also showed a decrease in ASH at 575 R but it also exhibits a sustantial increase in ASH at about 875 K. It has been theorized that this peak at 8750K is associated with crystallization and growth of the magnetic phase in the alloy.The substantially amorphous, grossly overquenched alloy melt spun at V 35 m s does not exhibit a decrease in ASH at 5 5750K but shows an even larger increase in ASH at about 8750K. In this and other examples, RE1 x Fel yBY x where 0.86 x 0.88 and 0.05 y 0.07 is believed to be the nominal composition of the phase primarily responsible for the hard magnetic properties. The preferred RE elements are neodymium and praseodymium which are virtually interchangeable with one another. The phase, however, is relatively insensitive to the substitution of as much as 40 percent of other rare earth elements for Pr and Nd without its destruction. In the same vein, substantial amounts of other transition metals can be substituted for iron without destroying the phase. This phase is believed to be present in all compositions of suitable microstructure having hard magnetic properties. Varying the amounts of the constituents, however, changes the amount of the magnetic phase present and conseguently the magnetic properties, particularly remanence. Figure 37 is a scanning electron micrograph of the fracture surface of an overguenched V5 30 m s Nd Fe095H005 086 ribbon showing the micro structure, near the free surface, the middle and the quench surface. The slower cooling free surface shows a very slight degree of crystallization which shows up on the micrograph as a speckled appearance. The dot in the middle frame of the Figure is an extraneous, nonsignificant SEM feature. The middle and quench surfaces of the ribbon appear to be substantially amorphous, that is, discrete crystallites are not obviously distinguishable. Figure 38 is an SEM of the fracture surface of the overquenched V 30 m s 5 Nd0.14 Fe0.95B0.05 0.86 alloy after a DSC anneal tc a maximum temperature of 9500K at a heating and cooling ramp rate of 1600K per minute. It is clear from this SEM that fairly regularly shaped crystallites or particles have formed in the ribbon as a result of the annealing step. These crystallites have an average size between 20 and 400 nanometers but are not as uniformly sized throughout the thickness of the ribbon as the crystallites of the 14.1 Mg.Oe directly quenched alloy. A uniform crystallite size seems to be characteristic of the highest energy product alloys. The measured preferred size range for these crystallites is in the range from about 20 to 400 nanometers, preferably about 40 50 nanometers average. Figure 39 shows the second quadrant magnet ization curves for optimally directly quenched alloys of this example compared with t overguenched and annealed Vs 20.5 and 35 m s samples. Example 28 Figure lo is a plot of magnetic remanence of Nd0.15 Fe1 yBy 0.85 for boron free and y 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09 alloys. The samples were cast from an orifice approximately 675 microns in size at a quench rate. of approximately 27,5 metres per second.As will be described hereinafter, the samples were heated to a peak temperature of approximately 975 K in a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating and cooling ramp rate of approximately 160 K per minute. The boron free alloy y 0.0 showed substantially no coercivity after anneal and magnetization.That containing 0,03 boron exhibited a coercivity of approximately 6 kiloOersteds. At a boron content of 0.05 both magnetic remanence and coercivity were substantially increased to approximately 17.5 kiloOersted and 7.5 kiloGauss, respectively. At a boron content of 0.07, the coercivity increased while the magnetic remanence dropped slightly. At a boron content of 0.09, both remanence and coercivitydropped with respect to the 0.07 boron content. Example 29 Figure 40 is a demagnetization plot for Pr0 l3fifFeg R 065 0,865 alloy that was melt spun through a 675 micron orifice onto a quench wheel moving at V5 30 m s. The resultant alloy ribbon was overquenched and had substantially no magnetic coercivity. Samples of the ribbon were annealed in a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating and cooling ramp rate of 160 K per minute to maximum peak temperatures of 900, 925 and 975 K respectively. The alloy heated to the 9000K maximum temperature had the highest magnetic remanence. Increasing the peak anneal temperature tended to reduce the remanence slightly but very much increased the coercivity. C3ear3y, praseodymium is also useful as the primary rare earth constituent of rare earth ironboron hard magnetic phase. At also appears to be evident that control of the time and temperature of annealing overquenched originally sDt permanently magnetic alloy can be controlled in such manner as to tailor the permanent magnetic properties. It seems that a rapid higher temperature anneal while reducing the remanence somewhat can be used to achieve very high magnetic coercivities. Dn the other hand, usino lower temperature rapid anneals may tena to maxinoze the energy product by increasing the magnetic remanence still at coercivities greater than 15 kilooersted. Example 3D Figure 41 shows demagnetization curves forRE0.135 Fe0.935B0.065 0.865 alloy where RE is praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, lanthanunm, cerium, terbium or dysprosium. ln each alloys only a single rare earth uas use, i.e., the rare earths were not blended with one another to form an alloy sample. Each alloy sample was melt spun through an ejection orifice approximately 675 microns in size onto a quench wheel rotating at V 30 in s. Each of the alloys as formed 5 had less than one kiloDersted coercivity and was overquenched.The alloy samples were annealed in the diffexential scanning calorimeter at heating and cooling ramp rates of 160 K per minute to a maximum temperature of 9500K and to a minimum temperature of below about 5000K. Praseodymium and neodymium were the only sole rare earth elements of those tried which created annealed alloys with high coercivity remanence and energy products. Samarium and lanthanum showed very slight coercivities coupled with fairly steepremanence curves. The cerium showed some coercivity and remanence. Terbium exhibited low coercivity and very low remanence. While none but the pure praseodymium and neodymium alloys showed characteristics suitable for making very strong permanent magnets, the hysteresis characteristics of the other rare earths may provide magnetic materials which could be very useful for soft magnetic or other magnetic applications. Example 31 Figure 42 shows the effect of substituting 20 percent of a different rare earth based on the amount of neodymium and such rare earth in Q.8 0.2 0.135 Fe0.935B0.065 0.865 alloys. Each of these 80 percent neodymium and 20 percent other rare earth alloys was melt spun and processed as inExample 30. The substitution of 20 percent dysprosium, praseodymium and lanthanum created alloys with good permanent magnetic properties. The terbium containing alloy had a coercivity higher than could be measured by the magnetometer. The samarium containing alloy exhibited a remanence of over 8 kiloGauss and a coercivity of about 6 kiloDersted. Table 1 shows the compositions, intrinsic coercivities, magnetic remanence and energy product for the alloys shown in Examples 30 and 31.

Neodymium and praseodymium metals can be mixed in suitable proportions with other rare earth elements to tailor the second quadrant magnetic characteristics for a particular application. For example, if a very high coercivity permanent magnet were desired terbium could be added to the composition. On the other hand, if magnetic remanence were the desired characteristic, it may be advantageous to add samarium. Example 32 Figure 43 shows the demagnetization curves for Nd0.135 TM0.935B0.065 0.865 where TM are the transition metals iron, cobalt and nickel. In thisFigure, the transition metals were not mixed with one another to form the alloy. The alloys were melt spun and processed as in Example 30. Of the transition metal elements, only iron yields an alloy with very good permanent magnetic properties. The cobalt shows moderate intrinsic.coercivities and remanence, while the nickel containing alloy shows high coercivity but practically no magnetic remanence. Figure 44 shows the effect of adding 10 percent transition metal based on the amount of iron in the alloy to alloys of Nd0.135 Fe0.841TM0.094B0.065 .0.65 Figure 45 shows like curves for the addition of 20 percent based on the atomic percent of iron for alloys ofNd0.135 Fe0.748TM0.187B0.065 0.86. These alloys were also processed as in Example 31. The substitution of 20 percent cobalt for iron in the alloys does not seem to have any deleterious affect, although 100 percent cobalt containing alloy does not exhibit very high remanence and coercivity. The incorpqration of nickel, chromium and manganese seem to substantially dilute the hard magnetic properties of the pure iron alloy. The addition of copper radically lowers the coercivity and somewhat lowers the magnetic remanence. At alloy addition levels of 20 percent based on the iron content, nickel and chromium very much reduced the coercivity and the remanence as compared to the all iron alloys. Manganese produces an alloy with no second quadrant coercivity or remanence. Table 11 shows the intrinsic coercivity, g magnetic remanence and energy products for neodymium transition metal boron alloys. The reported values are for the best overall combination of coercivity remanence and energy product where the aim is to produce a permanent magnet. Generally, such data represent the squarest shaped second quadrant demagnetization curve.

Chromium, manganese and nickel degrade the hard magnetic properties of the alloys. Small amounts of the elements zirconium and titanium were added to neodymium iron boron alloys, as set forth in Table 111. The alloy compositions were melt spun and processed as in Example 30. The inclusion of small amounts about If atomic percent of these elements still produced good hard magnetic alloys. The addition of zirconium had a tendency to substantially increase the intrinsic magnetic coercivity of the base alloy.

The combined permanent magnetic properties of coercivity, remanence and energy product for the subject RE Fe B alloys are comparable to those heretofore achieved only with oriented SmC05 and Sm2Col7 magnets. Not only are Pr, Nd and Fe less expensive than samarium and cobalt, but the subject magnetic alloys are easier and less expensive to process into permanent magnets. Compilation of data from the severalExamples indicates that the compositional range over which a major phase with the exhibited magnetic properties forms is fairly wide. For Re1 x Fe1 yBy y x alloys, X is preferably in the range of from about 0.5 to 0.9 andy iE in the range of from about 0.005 to 0.1. The balance of the alloys is preferably iron. Up to about 40 percent of the iron can be replaced with cobalt with no significant loss of magnetic. Neodymium and praseodymium appear to be fairly intechangeable as the principal rare earth constituent.Other rare earth elements such as samarium, lanthanum, cerium, terbium and dysprosium, probably in amounts up to about 40 percent of the total rare earth content, can be incorporated with neodymium and or praseodymium without destruction of the crystal structure of the magnetic phase or substantial loss of permanent magnetism. These rare earths can be added to purposefully modify the demagnetization curves. In view of the experimental data, the near optimum Nd Fe B and Pr Fe B alloy nominal compositions for maximizing permanent magnetic properties are approximately REo 135 FeO935Bo065 0o865 or expressed in terms of atomic fractions of the three constituent elements, RE0.135Fe0.809B0.056 or in terms of atomic fractions normalized to boron, RE2 4Fe14 4B1. The subject samples were prepared from commercially available constituents which do contain some residual contaminants such as oxides or nitrides. Should higher purity constituents be employed, the composition, specifically the Nd to combined Fe B ratio, would probably change slightly. The SEM data for the highest energy product direct quenched alloys indicate that the crystallites or particles within the microstructure have a fairly regular shape. Magnetic data also suggest that the crystal structure of the stable Nd Fe B intermetallic phase has high symmetry. Evidence for this is the high ratio of remanent to saturation magnetization.Electron microprobe analysis and TEN data suggest the presence of a small amount of a second phase of unidentified composition which may also contribute to the magnetic properties. The directly quenched and overquenched and annealed alloy ribbons appear to be magnetically isotropic as formed. This is evidenced by the fact that the ribbon can be magnetized and demagnetized to the same strength in any direction. Bowever, if single optimum magnetic domain size powder particles or the crystallites themselves can be caused to orient along a crystallographically preferred magnetic axis, it is possible that highly magnetically anisotropic alloys having much higher magnetic energy products than are reported herein would result. In order to characterize the stable magnetic phase, the initial X ray diffraction data were studied and neutron diffraction data were obtained.As seen in Figure 33, the X ray diffraction data for melt spun ribbon having optimum magnetic energy products have peaks which are broadened counterparts of those in the pattern from a single phase starting ingot with long range crystallographic ordering.Therefore, the Cu k alpha d spacing patterns for ingot alloy were used to determine the crystal structure of the major magnetic phase. X ray patterns strongly suggested a tetragonal crystal structure with room temperature lattice constants of a 8.78 angstroms and c 12.18 angstroms. An effort was then made to investigate the space groups of the apparently tetragonal crystallites of the magnetic phase in accordance with theInternational Tables for X Ray Crystallography, edited by N. Henry and K. Lonsdale Kynoch, Birmingham, 1952 , Vol. 1. The space group P42 mnm t136 was chosen as the most probable choice because it has a large number of atomic sites, several of which have high occupancy. To discover the positions of the neodymium and most of the iron atoms in this P42 mnm structure, neutron diffraction data were taken of powdered melt spun alloy ribbon having the formulaNd0.135 Fe0.935B0.065 at 673 K. This temperature is above the Curie temperature so that observed scattering is due only to nuclear and not magnetic scattering. A computer program based on that developed by H.N. Rietveld, Journal of AppliedCrystallography, Vol. 2, No. 65 1969 was used to synthetically generate neutron diffraction data assuming different atomic positions of the Nd, Fe andB atoms. Figure 46 a displays observed neutron diffraction data Figure 46 b shows the calculated spectrum which best corresponds with the high temperature neutron data and Figure 46 c shows the difference between the observed and calculated data.The goodness of fit index is 11.7 percent while the statistical uncertainty is 8.8 percent. The formula per unit cell associated with Figure 46 b isNd8Fe56B4 and the calculated density is 7.6 g cm3 which agrees with the measured density. This would mean that the atomic formula for the major phase of the magnetic alloys of this invention would be Nd2Fe14B1. The calculated data were sensitive to both the number and position of the boron atoms. Eight Nd atoms were found to occupy f and g sites 56 iron atoms to occupy kl, k2, j1. , e and c sites and 4 boron atoms to occupy g sites. Table V summarizes the symmetry sites and positions which generate the computed pattern.

Above this plane at z 0.16 and 0.84 in units of c lie hexagonal puckered arrays of iron atoms Figure 48 .Figure 49 shows the layers of iron atoms at locations z 0.25 and 0.75. Figure 50 shows iron nets projected onto the z w 0.34 and 0.66 planes. Figure 51 shows the plane containing Nd, Fe and B atoms midway along the c axis at z 0,5, Figure 52 shows a view of one entire unit cell. The relative length of the c axis is exaggerated to emphasize the puckering of the hexagonal iron meshes. The preferred magnetic axis, i.e. that axis of alignment which yields the highest magnetic anisotropy, is the crystallographic c axis. Rapid solidification of the alloy is believed to create a condition wherein the individual crystallites or particles in the alloy microstructure are about the same size or smaller than optimum single magnetic domain size. The optimum magnetic domain size is believed to about 40 50 nanometers average diameter. Alloys having crystallites in the size range of about 20 400 nanometers exhibit permanent magnetic properties. Alloys having smaller crystallites C 20 nanometers may be heated to promote crystallite growth to optimum magnetic domain size. The paths by which optimum crystallite size alloy can be made are 1 direct quench from the melt by means of a controlled quench rate process such as melt spinning, or 2 overquench to a microstructure having smaller than optimum single domain size crystallites followed by a heating process to promote crystallite growth to near optimum single magnetic domain size. In summary, new and exceptionally strong magnetic alloys have been discovered, based on the rare earth elements neodymium and praseodymium, the transition metal element iron and a small amount of the element boron. The inclusion of boron in theRE Fe systems provides many apparent advantages including the creation of an equilibrium phase with high apparent Curie temperature, a higher allowable ratio of iron to the more expensive rare earth constituents, a broad quench rate over which the optimum finely crystalline microstructure magnetic phase forms, and an ability to anneal overquenched alloy to create the optimum finely crystalline microstructure. The crystalline phase which forms is also tolerant to the substitution of limited amounts of many other constituents. It appears that the mayor phase of the magnetic alloys has a tetragonal crystal structure where the length of the a axis is about 8.78 angstroms and the c axis is about 12.18 angstroms.The composition of this phase is RE2Fel4Bl as determined by neutron diffraction analysis. Efficient ard economical means of making the subject alloys in forms adapted for the production of a new breed of permanent magnets have also been discovered. It is expected that these magnets will find application in many industrial environments. While the invention has been described in te ms of specific embodiments thereof, other forms may be readily adapted by one skilled in the art.Accordingly, the scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims.
