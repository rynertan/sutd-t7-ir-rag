# Filling method of particulate material into valved packing bag and apparatus employed therefor.

## Abstract
The present disclosure is directed to a method of filling a particulate material into a side valve type valved packaging bag which is so arranged that, for filling the particulate material into the side valve type valved packaging bag having a filling open ing for filling the particulate material therethrough, with a filling tube of the particulate material filling apparatus being inserted at the side portion of the bag, the axis of the filling tube is rotat ed through a predetermined angular range so that the dis charging direction of the particulate material from the end of the filling tube crosses the central plane for the opposite sides of the bag, from the side of the packaging bag formed with the filling opening during the filling function, and thus, by simul taneously effecting the feeding in of the particulate material and the rotating function of the filling tube as described above, the particulate material is filled into the packaging bag approxi mately uniformly. The disclosure is also directed to an appara tus for effecting the above described filling method, which is provided with a filling tube capable of rotating towards a prede termined direction with respect to its axis, and an axis rotating mechanism for the filling tube.
