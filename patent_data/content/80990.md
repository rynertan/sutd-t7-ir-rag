# Loudspeaker with wall reflex absorber.

## Abstract
A loudspeaker is provided for high quality and particu larly stereophonic sound reproducing systems positioned close to a wall of a room. To reduce distortion due to that part of the reflected sound which arrives from substantially the same direction as the direct sound, the positioning of the sound radiating surfaces is such as to make the reflected sound from the wall arrive substantially in phase with the direct sound throughout a large frequency range, whilst at higher frequencies the reflected sound is attenuated by a sound absorber. The loudspeaker has a casing with a rear wall 5a . Loudspeaker units arranged to be the sound source for mid range 12b and or high 14a frequencies has the sound radiating surfaces 12b, 15a at short distance D2, D1 from the plane of the rear wall 5a and facing slantwise forwards. A sound absorber 28a at the side of the casing, in front of and near the plane of the rear wall 5a and near the sound radiating surfaces 12b, 15a , serves to attenuate that part of the sound reflected by the room wall which has wave lengths shorter than eight times the shortest distance D1, D2 of the sound radiating surfaces from the plane of the rear wall 5a . In stereophonic systems the left hand and the right hand loudspeakers form a mirror image pair.
