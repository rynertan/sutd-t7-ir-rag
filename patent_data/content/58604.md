# Method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure having reduced lateral spacing between buried regions.

## Abstract
The lateral spacing between buried regions separated by oxide isolation regions in a semiconductor structure is reduced to as little as one micron by performing a deep implantation of ions of the conductivity type opposite to that of the buried regions generally into portions of the substrate below the sites where the oxide isolation regions are formed.
