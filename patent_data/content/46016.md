# Device for slicing through a plug of potting compound.

## Abstract
A device for slicing through a plug 22 of potting compound potting the end of the bundle of hollow fibres in a separation module 12 in order to open the end of the fibres, comprises a fixed receptacle 20 holding the plug 22 and having a notch 24 at which the plug 22 is exposed. A knife 16 is mounted on the piston rod of a pneumatic cylinder to enable it to be moved past the notch 24 and cut a slice from the exposed part of the plug. The knife 16 is of inverse plough shape, that is a compound V shape and in effect forms two sub blades with cutting edges 34a, 36a .
