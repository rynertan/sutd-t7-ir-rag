# Apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
Apparatus comprising a melter tank 11 , a pump 12 contained with the melter tank 11 , a dispenser, and a manifold block 13 mounted on the bottom of the melter tank 11 . Thermoplastic material melt in the tank 11 flows from the melter tank 11 through the pump 12 through the manifold block 13 to the dispenser. The melter tank 11 comprises a novel electrical resistance heating element 80 cast into the bottom wall 14 of the tank 11 . The heating element 80 is asymetrically shaped within the bottom wall 14 of the melter tank 11 and is so configured that the length of the heater element 80 within any portion of the bottom wall 14 is proportional to the mass of material, including melter tank 11 , manifold block 13 , pump 12 , and thermoplastic material to be heated by the given length of heater element 80 within that portion. Additionally, the tank 11 side walls are generally triangular in cross section with the thicker part of the triangular shaped side walls located adjacent the bottom of the tank. A portion of the heating element 80 is located directly under each side wall so that heat is effectively conducted from the bottom wall 14 into the side wall 36,38 , and from the side walls 36,38 into the thermoplastic material contained within the tank 11 .
