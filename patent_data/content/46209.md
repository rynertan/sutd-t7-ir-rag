# Steel hard carbide macrostructured tools, compositions and methods of forming.

## Abstract
Composition of matter composed of 33 to 80 weight per cent of a carbide material having a particle size greater than 400 mesh, and 23 to 70 weight per cent of a metallic matrix material, the carbide material which may be a ce mented composite 30 , being embedded in and bonded to said metallic matrix material 25 by powder metallurgical techniques of compaction and high temperature and high pressure diffusion bonding and tools having a cemented carbide wear or cutting element 30 , these tools also being formed by powder metallurgy techniques.
