# Ultramicrotome diamond tool.

## Abstract
An ultramicrotome diamoncl tool is provided with a diamond knife blade having first and second planar surfaces which intersect to define a cutting edge and a shank for holding the knife blade. In one embodiment of the ultramic rotome diamond tool the cutting edge of the blade is defined by the intersection of naturally occurring 111 and 100 crystal planes and is primarily usable in materials science and machine tool applications. In a second embodiment of the ultramicrotome diamond tool, the cutting edge of the blade is defined by the intersection of naturally occurring 320 and 111 crystal planes and is primarily usable in biological science applications to cut biological tissue or the like. The blade is usable to cut a material specimen that has a longitudinal axis and that is being advanced in a direction along its longitudinal axis toward the ultramicrotome tool. The blade is mounted on a shank having a longitudinal axis. The shank is moulted on a base to cause the longitudinal axis of the shank to be substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the material specimen.
