# Information processing system with enhanced instruction execution and support control.

## Abstract
An information processing system including a system memory and a processor. A cache for storing a copy of a subset of the information stored in the system memory and providing information therefrom to the processor. The cache includes a cache memory connected from the system memory and to the processor for storing and providing the copies of the information contained in the subset and a write merge for writing information from the processor to the system memory. The write merge is responsive to a memory write address referring to information contained in the copy of the subset residing in the cache memory for reading the corresponding information from the cache memory, merging the information to be written to the system memory and the corresponding information read from the cache memory, writing the merged information into the cache memory, and providing the merged information to the system memory. The processor includes a microinstruction control means, ing microinstruction memory, first microinstruction address means for providing the initial addresses of microinstruction sequences and second microinstruction address means for the sequential selection of microinstructions.
