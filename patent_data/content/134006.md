# Cooling system for automotive engine or the like.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine cooling system wherein the coolant is boiled and the vapor produced condensed in a radiator in a manner that the rate of condensation under light engine load is maintained at a level sufficiently low to raise the pressure within the system and thus raise the boiling point of the coolant while under heavy load increased to the point of lowering the pressure in the system and thus lower the coolant boiling point, an arrangement is provided to reduce the heat exchange capacity of the radiator when the rate of con densation therein due to uncontrollable external influences be comes excessive. When the engine is stopped, coolant is ad mitted to fill the system. To purge any air or like noncondensi ble which finds its way into the system, liquid coolant is pumped in to overfill the system and flush same out during en gine warm up.
