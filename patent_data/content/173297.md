# CAFFEINE ADSORPTION ON AMORPHOUS SILICA

## Abstract
Adsorbents comprising amorphous silicas, specifically silica gels and precipitated silicas, are useful in processes for the removal of caffeine from solutions. Dehydroxylated, hydrophobic silicas are preferred for use with aqueous so lutions, for use with non aqueous solutions hydrophilic sili cas are preferred. The adsorbed caffeine may be eluted from the silica with water.
