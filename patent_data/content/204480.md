## Description
SYNTHETIC VACCINES FOR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE Foot and mouth disease FMD is a highly contagious, debilitating disease that afflicts cloven hoofed animals. The causative agent, foot and mouth disease virus FMDV , is a small animal virus of the picornavirus family having a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of about 8000 nucleotides. In the past, vaccines have been produced forFMD using either an inactivated virus or a live attenuated virus. These approaches, although generally effective, have not been problem free. Occasions on which the virus was incompletely inactivated or insufficiently attenuated can and have given rise to FMD outbreaks. A synthetic FMDV vaccine which would eliminate all aspects of virus handling in production and vaccination is perceived as a most desirable alternative D. Rowlands, Endeavor 8 3 , 123 127 1984 . Studies of FMDV over the last several years have established that the picornavirus contains primarily four capsid proteins designated VP1, VP2, VP3, andVP4. The actual labelling of these VP proteins has been subject to a measure of inconsistency. The relevant protein insofar as this invention is concerned has been designated VPa by some research groups see, e.g., Plead et al., Science 214, 1125 1981 while being labelled VPi by others see, e.g., Clarke et al, FEBS Letters 157, 261 1983 . For present purposes this protein is designated VP1. VP1 has been the subject of considerable investigation and structural analysis, it having been found to elicit a neutralizing antibody response in swine J. Laporte, J. Grosclaude, J. Wantyghem,S. Bernard, P. Rouze, C. R. Acad. Sci. 276, 3399 1973 and to protect both swine and cattle from FMDV infection H.L. Bachrach, D.M. Moore, P.D. McKercher, J. Polatnick,J. Immunol. 115, 1636 1975 1. A biosynthetic fusion polypeptide of TrpLE and VP1, upon multiple vaccination, has been reported to protect cattle and swine against a viral contact challenge D.G. Kleid, D. Yansura, B. Small,D. Dowbenko, D. Moore, M. Grubman, P. McKercher D.O.Morgan, E.V. Robertson, H.L. Bachrach, Science 214, 1125 1129 1981 . Strohmaier et al., J. Gen. Virol. 59, 295 306 1982 , having chemically and enzymatically digested VP1, have concluded that major immunogenic regions capable of raising neutralizing antibodies are present at amino acid sequences 146 154 and 201 213. Bittle et al., Nature 298, 30 33 1982 chemically synthesized peptides corresponding to regions 141 160 and 200 213 of the VP1 polypeptide of FMDV and demonstrated the ability of these peptides to produce high levels of neutralizing antibody in guinea pigs and rabbits. A report on this work is contained also in thePCT International Patent Application No. WO 83 03,547, published October 27, 1983. A major theme throughout all of the foregoing work with the small peptide sequences is the belief and finding that their immunogenic effect, if present at all, is achieved only upon the linking of the peptide to a high molecular weight carrier, most often keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH carrier. PCT Application No. WO 83 03,547 suggests that a small peptide, in monomeric and uncyclized form, is incapable of eliciting a neutralizing index sufficient to achieve viral protection. Specifically, the publication states that a neutralizing index of about 1.5 or greater is required to protect an animal against the virus and that the neutralizing index of the monomeric, unconjugated peptide having a sequence which corresponds substantially to the amino acid residue sequence in positions about 141 to about 160 of CiK FMDV is approximately 0.5. This result is to be compared with neutralizing indices of about 3.7 to about 3.9 reported for the same peptide when conjugated to KLH. A class of novel, monomeric, uneonjugated, small peptides has now been discovered. These peptides, administered free of any carrier, are capable of eliciting an unforeseen markedly enhanced neutralization response against FMDV. These peptides have induced unprecedented protection in cattle with single vaccination and complete protection after repeat immunization.Until the present discovery, this latter achievement has been proven only with antigens approximately five times larger in size than these newly discovered peptides. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a compound containing a sequence of Formula I X A Y B Z I in which A and B are amino acid residue sequences comprising sequences of the foot and mouth disease virus VP1 capsid protein serotypes, one of which contains from 18 to 24 amino acid residues and includes the amino acid residue sequence in positions 141 to 158 of the 0 serotype or the equivalent sequence of other serotypes and the other of which contains from 14 to 20 amino acid residues and includes the amino acid residue sequence in positions 200 to 213 of the 0 serotype or the equivalent sequence of other serotypes X is H, H Cys, or H Cys Cys, the sulfhydryls of which may be blocked or free Z is OH, Cys OH, or Pro Cys Gly OR, the sulfhydryls of which may be blocked or free and Y is a sequence of from about 2 to about 6 amino acid residues, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. As noted, this invention is directed to a class of synthetic, immunogenic peptides of Formula I X A Y B Z. I The groups A and B include amino acid sequences corresponding to selected sequences present in the VP capsid protein of FMDV serotype 0, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren 01 K and equivalent analogous sequences present in any of other foot and mouth disease virus serotypes. Seven serotypes of FMDV are known to exist.The most common are European and carry designations A, 0, and C. Others are three South African, SAT 1, SAT 2, and SAT 3, and one Asian, Asia l. Each serotype in addition is known to have a number of subtypes and associated subtype strains. Specific examples are serotype 0, subtype 1, strain Kaufbeuren 01 K serotype 0, subtype 1, strain Campos 01C serotype 0, subtype 1, strain British Field Strain O1BFS serotype A, subtype 10, strain 61 A10,61 serotype A, subtype 12, strain 119 A12,119 serotype A, subtype 24, strainCruzeiro A24C serotype A, subtype 27 A27 serotypeA, subtype 79 A79 and serotype C, subtype 3, strainIndaial C3I . The amino acid residue sequences in positions 141 158 and 200 213 of the 0 serotype represent the focus of the definitions of groups A and B of the peptides of this invention. In any specific instance group A includes one of the sequences and group B the other. In addition, the analogous but not necessarily identical sequences present in any of the other serotype and serotype subtypes are included within the definition of the groups A and B. In those cases in which the definition of the groups A and B includes a length of amino acid residues greater than 18 and 14 amino acids for the sequences corresponding to amino acids 141 158 and 200 213 of the 0 serotype, respectively, the remaining residues can be any amino acid. For purposes of illustration, the following are provided as examples of the sequence 141 158 for 01K and analogous sequences of other viral serotypes and subtypes 141 150 158 o 1x ValProAsnLeuArgGlyAspLeuGlnValLeuAlaGlnLysValAlaArgThr O1BFS ValProAsnLeuArgGlyAspLeuGlnValLeuAlaGlnLysValAlaArgThr o 1c ValProAsnValArgGlyAspLeuGlnValLeuAlaGlnLysValAlaArgThrA10,61 Ser ArgSer GlyAspLeuGlySerIleAlaAlaArgValAlaThrGlnA12,119 SerGly ValArgGlyAspPheGlySerLeuAlaProArgValAlaArgGln A24C SerGly ArgArgGlyAspMetGlyThrLeuAlaAlaArgValValLysGlnA27 Gin ArgAlaGlyAspMetGlySerLeuAlaAlaArgValAlaLysGlnA79 SerGly ArgArgGlyAspMetGlySerLeuAlaAlaArgValAlaLysGln C3 I ArgArgGlyAspLeuValHisLeuAlaAlaAlaHisAlaArgHis The following are examples of the sequence 200 213 for O1K and analogous sequences of other viral serotypes and subtypes 200 213O1K ArgHisLysGlnLysIleValAlaProValLysGlnThrLeuO1BFS ArgHisLysGlnLysIleValAlaProValLysGlnThrLeu A10,61 ArgTyrLysGlnLysIleIleAlaProAlaLysGlnLeuLeuA12,119 ArgHisLysGlnLysIleIleAlaProGlyLysGln LeuA24C ArgHisLysGlnLysIleIleAlaProAlaLysGlnLeuLeu C3 I ArgHisLysGlnProLeuIleAlaProAlaLysGlnLeuL In the peptides provided by this invention, one of the groups A or B contains a peptide sequence 141 158 and the other a peptide sequence 200 213.Preferably, one of the groups A or B is a peptide sequence 141 158 and the other is a peptide sequence 200 213. More preferably, group A is the sequence 200 213 and group B the sequence 141 158. Even more preferably, the groups A and B of the peptides of this invention are peptide sequences derived from the sameFMDV serotype. The group X represents the amino terminal portion of the peptides of this invention. X can represent the hydrogen of the amino terminus or a mono cysteinyl or di cysteinyl extension. If X is monoor di cysteinyl, the cysteine sulfhydryls may be blocked or free. Any of a wide range of blocking groups familiar to those skilled in the art can be used. Examples of these are sulfonate, carboxymethyl, carboxamidomethyl, aminoethyl, and the like. Preferably, however, X is hydrogen. The group z defines the carboxyl terminal of the peptides of this invention. Z thus is a hydroxyl or a cysteine containing extension, viz., cysteine or the tripeptide Pro Cys Gly OH. Again, the cysteine may be blocked or free, and, if blocked, can be so blocked using any of the same blocking groups previously described. The group Y links groups A and B and represents an amino acid residue or a sequence having from 2 to 6 amino acid residues. Preferably, Y is an amino acid sequence having from 2 to 4 amino acid residues.The sequence can be comprised of any of a wide range of amino acid residues, proline being an amino acid residue of choice, and sequences containing Pro Pro being particularly preferred. Specific preferred sequences may be Pro Pro Ser, or Leu Pro Pro Thr. Included in the compounds of this invention are their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and their pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acid salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to those salts useful in the chemotherapy of a warmblooded animal The term pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts encompasses both organic and inorganic acid addition salts including, for example, those prepared from acids such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, sulfuric, sulfonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic, nitric, benzoic, ascorbic, p toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, propionic, and the like.Preferably, the acid addition salts are those prepared from hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, or succinic acid.The above salts are prepared by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art. The term carboxylic acid salts includes, for example, ammonium, alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and the like. For convenience, the amino acids referred to are described by their approved shorthand three letter designations. These designations are as follows 3 letter Alanine Ala Arginine Arg Asparagine Asn Aspartic Acid Asp 3 letter Cysteine Cys Glutamic Acid Glu Glutamine Gin Glycine Gly Histidine His Isoleucine Ile Leucine Leu Lysine Lys Phenylalanine Phe Proline Pro Serine Ser Threonine Thr Tryptophan Trp Tyrosine Tyr Valine Val Examples of compounds of this invention are VP1 O1K H 200 213 ProProSer 141 158 ProCysGly OH VP1 O1K H Cys 200 213 ProProSer 141 158 Cys OH VP1 O1K H CysCys 200 213 ProProSer 141 158 ProCysGly OH VP1 O1K H 200 213 ProProSer 141 158 OH VP1 O1BFS H 141 158 ProPro 200 213 OH VP1 A10,61 H 141 158 LeuProProSer 200 213 OH VP1 A12,119 H Cys 200 213 LeuProProSer 141 158 OH VP1 A24C H 200 213 ValProProThrArg 141 158 OH VP1 O1C H CysCys 141 158 ProPro 200 213 Cys OH VP1 C3I H 200 213 ProProSer 141 158 OH VP1 01K H Cys ArgTyrAsnArgAsnAla 141 158 Leu ProProThr GluAla 200 213 10H and the like. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by any of a variety of recognized peptide synthesis techniques including classical solution methods, solid phase methods, and the more recently available recombinant DNA methods. One of the principal methods for preparing the compounds of this invention is by the solid phase technique in which the amino acid sequence is constructed sequentially from an initial, insoluble, resin supported C terminal amino acid. Techniques for the solid phase method are described by J. Stewart et al., Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Pierce Chemical Co.,Rockford, Illinois, 1984. Specific examples in state of the art solid phase peptide synthesis which iay be utilized in the preparation of these FMDV synthetic immunogens are provided in reports by R.D. DiMarchi, J.P. Tam, R.B. Merrifield, Int. J. Pep. Prot. Res. 19, 270 279 1982 R.B. Merrifield, L.D. Vizioli, H.G. Boman, Biochem. 21, 5020 5031 1982 S. Mojsov, R.B. Merrifield, Eur. J.Biochem. 145, 601 605 1984 . The more important features are the following 1. Utilization of copoly styrene 1 divinylbenzene resin, 200 400 mesh beads, available from Bio Rad laboratories. 2. Functionalization of the resin support to aminomethyl resin by the method of Mitchell et al., 1978 see below . 3. Amidation of the carboxy terminal amino acid to the aminomethyl resin as its t butyloxy carbonyl aminoacyl 4 oxymethyl phenyl acetic acid derivative. 4. Cleavage of the amino protecting t butyloxy carbonyl Boc group in 50 TFA CH2C12 and neutralization of the amine in 5 DIEA CH2C12. 5. Double coupling at each residue is utilized. With the exception of Asn, Gln, and Arg the first coupling is by preformed symmetrical anhydride. The second coupling in all cases is by preformed HOBt ester. The first cou pling for the aforementioned exceptions is analogous to the second coupling. 6. The peptide is cleaved from the resin support by exposure to an acid in the presence of a carbonium ion scavenger. 7. The following side chain protecting groups preferably are utilized Arginine tosyl , Aspartic acid O cyclopentyl , Cysteine 4 methoxybenzyl , Glutamic acid O cyclopentyl , Histidine benzyloxymethyl , Lysine 2 chloro benzyloxycarbonyl , Serine benzyl , Threonine benzyl , Tryptophan formyl and Tyrosine 2 bromobenzyloxycarbonyl . The preferred peptidyl resin cleavage condi tions involve exposing the pepti dyl resin to anhydrous HF at a temperature of from 100C to 150C. The preferred carbonium ion scavenger is p cresol. Compounds of this invention can also be prepared via recombinant DNA methodology. In their preparation, a nucleotide sequence coding for the desired peptide is prepared using now routine methods for such synthesis. These methods generally involve preparation of oligonucleotides coding both for fragments of the desired coding sequence and for the complementary sequence thereof. The oligonucleotides are designed to provide overlap of one fragment of the coding sequence with two fragments of the complementary sequence and vice versa. The oligonucleotides are paired and joined, ultimately producing the desired gene sequence. The sequence is inserted into a cloning vector at a location which permits expression of the peptide product for which it codes. A suitable cloning vector contains at least a portion of a gene s expression control sequence. A typical expression control sequence can be described in terms of five elements. In the order in which they appear in the gene, the elements are as follows a the promoter region b the 5 untranslated region c the protein coding sequence d the 3 untranslated region and e the transcription termination site. The function of each of these elements in gene systems is well recognized. The promoter region mediates initiation of messenger RNA mRNA production transcription . The promoter may be 1 free of external control constitutive , 2 under the control of a repressor, a substance that, when present, represses gene function, or 3 lu jder the control of an inducer, a substance that is required to induce gene function. The lipoprotein spy gene, for example, is free from external control and thus is termed constitutive . Located at or near the promoter is the transcription initiation site , a point at which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription of mRNA. Once transcription is initiated, mRNA is produced. The structure of the resulting mRNA is determined by the DNA sequences of the gene elements b to d above. The resulting mRNA carries a sequence which is translatable into protein product. The translatable sequence is located downstream from the 5 untranslated region and upstream from the 3 untranslated region.Translation is mediated by the binding of ribosomes to a sequence in the mRNA 5 untranslated region denoted as the ribosome binding site and is initiated at the translation start codon AUG appearing as the first codon of the product gene sequence and coding as well for the amino acid methionine Met . Translation terminates at one or more termination codons appearing at the end of the translation region. By the techniques of recombinant DNA, it has become possible to prepare cloning vectors useful for the production of selected foreign exogenous proteins by inserting into such vectors an expression control sequence, i.e., a sequence of nucleotides that controls and regulates expression of structural genes with production of exogenous protein when operatively linked to those genes. In the context of the foregoing, the term expression control sequence includes elements a , b , d , and e above. Recombinant DNA methodology can be employed to express compounds of this invention either as a portion of a larger hybrid molecule or by direct expression.In the direct expression mode, the cloning vector is designed such that the expression product is composed entirely of desired product preceded by a methionine Met residue resulting from the presence of the essential start codon. The superfluous Met residue can be removed by treating the product with cyanogen bromide or with phenyl isothiocyanate followed by a strong anhydrous acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid. In the hybrid molecule expression mode, a DNA sequence coding for the desired product is inserted into the expression control sequence of a cloning vector at a point such that the product expressed comprises a hybrid protein. Hybrid protein means a recombinant DNA product comprising a foreign protein, generally all or a portion of the natural endogenous protein produced by the expression control sequence for example, lipoprotein in the lipoprotein gene , to which is attached the desired protein. The properly designed hybrid protein produced by recombinant DNA methodology will contain a cleavage site at the junction of the endogenous protein portion and the desired product. The cleavage site permits generation of mature product by chemical or enzymatic treatment of the hybrid protein product. Highly useful selective cleavage sites comprise a DNA sequence which codes for an amino acid or a sequence of amino acids which can be cleaved chemically or enzymatically at itsC terminal. Examples of chemical agents useful for cleaving proteins are cyanogen bromide, BNPS skatole, hydroxylamine, and the like. Cyanogen bromide cleaves proteins at the C terminal of a methionine residue.Therefore, the selective cleavage site is a methionine residue itself. Hydroxylamine cleaves at the C terminal of the moiety Asn Z in which Z is Gly, Leu, or Ala. BNPS skatole cleaves at the C terminal of a tryptophan residue. Examples of enzymatic agents useful for cleavage are trypsin, papain, pepsin, plasmin, thrombin, enterokinase, and the like. Each effects cleavage at a particular amino acid sequence which it recognizes. For example, the selective cleavage site that enterokinase recognizes is the amino acid sequence Asp Lys in which n is an integer from 2 to 4. A most preferred selective cleavage site, especially for those compounds of this invention that lack methionine, is a methionine residue. This residue, joined to the N terminus of the desired product, is readily cleaved by known methods using cyanogen bromide to produce the desired mature product. In constructing useful cloning vectors, several elements are required. Two of the required elements are common to all useful cloning vectors.First, the vector must have a DNA segment containing a functional origin of replication replicon . Plasmids and phage DNA by their very nature contain replicons facilitating replication in a host cell. Secondly, the vector must have a DNA segment which conveys to a transformable host cell a property useful for selection of transformed cells from nontransformed cells. Any of a wide range of properties can be used for selection purposes. One of the most commonly used properties is antibiotic resistance, e.g., tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance. The foregoing two elements generally are present in readily available and recognized cloning vectors. Examples of suitable cloning vectors are bacterial plasmids, such as plasmids from E. coli, including pBR322, pMB9, ColEl, pCR1 wider host range plasmids, including RP4 phage DNAs, such as lambda, and the like. Most, if not all, of the above recognized vectors already carry the aforedescribed two elements. A third element is the expression control sequence. Any of a wide range of such control sequences can be used including, for example, those from the lipoprotein gene, the ss galactosidase gene, the tryptophan gene, the ss lactamase gene, phage lambda, and the like. In producing a suitable cloning vector by insertion of the selected expression control sequence, routine methods are used. Various sites exist within cloning vectors at which cuts can be made using a restriction endonuclease specific for such site. Any of these sites can be selected for insertion of the expression control sequence. As an example, in the wellrecognized and documented plasmid pBR322, several suitable restriction sites exist, any of which may be employed as insertion sites. A PstI site is located within the gene for B lactamase. Other sites outside of any specific coding region are EcoRI and PvuII. These and other sites are well recognized by those skilled in the art. Taking advantage of any of these sites or others, insertion of an expression control sequence or the essential portion thereof can be readily accomplished in production of vectors defined by this invention. A fourth element, of course, is the DNA sequence coding for the desired product. As previously noted, this DNA sequence can be constructed synthetically, e.g., using the recognized phosphotriester method or other well recognized methods. Suitable cloning vectors can be used in a wide range of host organisms, for example, gram negative prokaryotic organisms such as Escherichia coli, Serratia, Pseudomonas, and the like gram positive prokaryotic organisms, such as Bacillus, Streptomyces, and the like and eukaryotic organisms, such as Saccharomyces, and the like. Preferably, the host organism is a gram negative prokaryotic organism. Of gram negative prokaryotic organisms, E. coli is especially preferred, for example, E. coli K 12 strains, such as RV308. Employing well recognized methodology, the appropriately prepared cloning vectors are used to transform suitable host organisms, are amplified in such organisms, and exogenous protein product is expressed using standard fermentation conditions. The exogenous protein product is isolated by routine methods from the resulting fermentation broth. Thus, in accordance with the invention, there also is provided a process for preparing a synthetic foot and mouth disease vaccine containing a sequence ofFormula I X A Y B Z I , in which X, A, Y, B and Z are as defined previously, which comprises a Cleaving a protecting group from a correspond ingly protected compound of Formula I or b Culturing a microorganism transformed by an expression transfer vector containing a DNA sequence coding for a compound of Formula I , under conditions suitable for expression of the DNA sequence coding for the compound of Formula I , and purifying the Formula I compound from the lysate or culture medium of said microorganism and c If desired, salifying a free compound to form a corresponding pharmaceutical ly acceptable salt. The compounds of this invention, active in treating foot and mouth disease, can be used in a variety of pharmaceutical compositions and formulations and can be administered by a variety of conventional routes, such as intranasal, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal. In administering the compounds of this invention, the pharmaceutical forms suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectible solutions or dispersions. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, m cresol, sorbic acid, and the like. In many cases, it will be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the compounds of this invention in the required amount of the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients, as desired. If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds can be incorporated into slow release or targeted delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. Doses of the compounds of this invention are administered to the recipient for a period during which prophylactic or therapeutic treatment for foot and mouth disease is desired. The weight of the recipient and mode of administration will have an influence upon the size of the dose necessary to induce a particular response. It is especially advantageous to formulate the compounds of this invention in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form refers to a physically discrete unit suited to provide a single dose for the subject to be treated.Each unit contains a predetermined quantity of the compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in association with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The specific unit dosage form is dictated by and directly dependent upon a the unique characteristics of the particular composition and b the particular effect to be achieved The following non limiting examples are provided to further illustrate the invention.

An equivalent amount 1.4 mmol of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at OOC, after which dicyclohexylurea was removed by filtration and the supernatant added to 4 gm of aminomethyl resin suspended in 20 ml of methylene chloride. After two hours, the resin was filtered, washed three times with 40 ml of methylene chloride, and then suspended in 40 ml of 0.5M acetic anhydride 0.lM DIEA methylene chloride.After an additional two hours, the resin was ninhydrin negative. The resin was washed three times with 40 ml of methylene chloride, and subsequently the t butyloxycarbonyl protecting group of glycine was removed in 40 ml of trifluoroacetic acid methylene chloride 1 1, v v .D. Repetitive Stepwise Synthetic Protocol In each case double coupling of each amino acid, in three fold excess to amine, was utilized.While Asn, Gln, and Arg were coupled twice as their preformed HOBt esters, the remaining amino acids were first coupled as their preformed symmetrical anhydrides and repeated as their preformed HOBt esters. Neutralization, deprotection and all washing were fully automated by the following protocol, at 15 ml of solvent gram of starting resin.1. 5 DIEA CH2C12 2 x 2 minutes 2. CH2C12 6 x 1 minute 3.

The procedure described below for the smallest peptide studied was essentially the same for all peptides which were chemically bound to KLH. The maximum advisable loading level of SPDP N succinimidyl 3 2pyridithio propionate to KLH was determined according to the extent of precipitation of the complex which occurred over a 60 minute reaction. It was observed that a 250 molar excess of SPDP to KLH was optimum.One half gram of KLH s1 x 10 4 mmol was dissolved in 25 ml of 0.1M Na2HPO4, pH 7.2 with gentle sonication. A small quantity of insoluble material was removed by contrifugation, and to the supernatant was added 7.81 mg of SPDP 2.5 x 10 2 mmol in 625 Cil of DMF. After alkaline uptake ceased, the sample was centrifuged with the supernatant desalted by G 25 Sephadex chromatography, in 0.lM Na2RPO4, pH 7.2 at 20 cm hr. The loading level achieved in the derivatization was determined to be approximately 40 by DTT reduction. To 100 mg of the functionalized KLH 2 x 10 6 mol of ligand in 25 ml of 0.1M Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, was added a ten fold excess 44 mg, 2 x 1035 mol of the 141 158 ProCysGly reduced peptide in 600 pl of 0.1MTris buffer at pH 7.4. The reaction was monitored by liberation of the ligand and found to be near quantitative in 60 minutes at 220C. The sample was desalted onSephacryl 5 200 in 0.1M NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, and lyophillized.The yields in coupling the 21 , 25 , and 38 residue peptides as based on limited reactant were, respectively, 84 , 85 and 68 .J. Formulation of Peptides. All peptides and peptide KSH conjugates were dissolved in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, at the desired concentration and then diluted 1 1 with Freund s Complete adjuvant. The total volume as well as the antigen concentration administered to each animal is described for each experiment.II. Biological ProtocolA. Guinea Pig Vaccination Duncan Hartly closed colony random bred female guinea pigs, weighing 450 500 gms were used in all experiments. Each vaccine preparation was administered at the described dosage by subcutaneous injection in a volume of 0.15 ml to each member of a group of five guinea pigs. The only exception to the 0.15 ml total volume dosage was a 0.45 ml dose which was used in the antigen dose titration to deliver the highest concentration stated. The control vaccine was prepared from the Ol Kaufbeuren strain, which was the one from which the published sequence data was derived. The vaccine was prepared with aluminium hydroxide gel and contained 1.66 mg of saponin per dose. Each of five guinea pigs was given one milliliter of vaccine by subcutaneous injection.The challenge virus was of the Cl Kaufbeuren strain as described above. It was adapted to guinea pigs by serial passage of vesicular lymph and used for challenge purposes at the fifth guinea pig passage level. Following the virus titration, a 1 20 dilution was made to give a challenge dose of 103 5 guinea pig ID50, i.e., 3,000 infective doses per animal. All test animals were given the challenge virus by intradermal inoculation of the left hind foot pad volume 0.02 ml.Each challenged guinea pig was observed for the subsequent 7 days for development of secondary or generalized lesions on the other hind foot or hands or mouth. The criterion of protection was the absence of any secondary lesions. B. Cattle Vaccination Six to eight month old heifers of mixed breeds weighing approximately 150 180 kg which were susceptible to foot and mouth disease were used in all experiments.Each vaccine preparation was administered at the described dosage by subcutaneous injection in a volume of 3 ml to each member of a group of three cattle. In each test a group of three cattle was non vaccinated and served as positive experimental controls. All the animals were challenged by intradermolingual injection of 104 ID50 of freshly titrated O1BFS 1860 virus in a 0.1 ml dose at ten sites on the tongue. Animals were examined daily post challenge for evidence of increase in body temperature and lesion development on the tongue and feet. Animals were deemed to be protected provided that no secondary lesions developed by seven days post infection. All animal testing and sera evaluation was conducted at the Animal Viral Research Institute, UnitedKingdom.C. Determination of Serum Neutralizing Titers SNT The method employed for quantitation of serum neutralization titers was as described by Golding, S.M.,Hedger, R.S., Talbot, T., Watson, J., Research inVeterinary Science 40, 142 147 1976 . All ELISA antibody titers are defined as directed against the peptide 140 160. Extremely close correlation of ELISA determinations and serum neutralization titers has been achieved in all vaccinations utilizing the described peptides.III. Biological Results. The most convincing method for establishing the relative potency of a series of potential synthetic peptide vaccines is to determine their minimum protective molar dose. Table 2 represents dose titration results obtained in guinea pigs with four differing immunogens. While the data is illuminating in several respects, the most important aspect is the marked enhancement in serum neutralizing titers SNT and protection achieved through the 38 and 40 residue peptides in comparison to that of the 21 residue peptide. Clearly these results indicate the unexpected advantageous properties of the compounds of this invention, which provide optimal protection upon viral challenge.The 38 and 40 residue peptides appear to be equivalent within experimental error and thereby minimize any importance of the amino terminal CysCys residues in the latter. These two peptides appear to confer complete protection at less than one tenth to onehundredth the dose of the 21 residue antigenic peptide.However, the unprecedented ability to protect guinea pigs against FMDV free of any stated carrier aignifi cantly simplifies the approach and eliminates a major source of variability. The most desirable synthetic agent capable of providing complete protection is that which encompasses the minimal viral structural information in a highly defined and pure state. The elimination of KLH or any like carrier while still providing protection marks a significant advance in the synthetic approach to vaccination.

The necessity of antigen optimization is of utmost importance, because commercialization will quite likely warrant utilization of an adjuvant of lesser potency than Complete Freunds. Table 3 reveals that at a molar dose comparable to that which provided protection with the 21 residue peptide in Complete Freunds adjuvant, the 40 residue peptide was completely protective with a commercially acceptable Al OH 3 adjuvant.The absolute weight of antigen providing full protection of guinea pigs with the latter adjuvant, in a single vaccination, is less than 1 mg.

Table 4 represents the results of cattle vaccination, with the 40 residue peptide, followed by the conventional challenge consisting of direct viral infection of the tongue in each vaccinated animal. The serum. neutralization titers increased rapidly to reach a near maxima at Day 14, which was maintained at least through the time of challenge Day 32 . Two of the nine animals which were challenged on Day 32 were completely protected, having exhibited no signs of secondary lesions. These animals represent the first example of successful single cattle vaccination for FMD with a synthetic peptide. This attests to the potency of the immunogens of this invention. Furthermore, by serological determination of the neutralization antibody concentrations immediately prior to challenge it is not possible to predict protection.In comparison to the known minimum levels of neutralizing antibody concentrations required by a conventional FMD vaccine all of these animals should have been clearly protected. Consequently, at this time it is not acceptable to establish the efficacy of a peptide vaccine on the comparative basis of its SNT value with a conventional vaccine. Reimmunization of animals 1, 2, and 3 led to complete protection after an additional 14 days prior to challenge. Antibody titers in these animals as measured by ELISA were observed to increase approximately one half of a log unit following booster immunization. This 40 residue peptide is less than one fifth the size of any other synthetic antigen which has proven capable of cattle protection. Its synthetic nature will allow evaluation of its inherent activity in combination with various adjuvants, free of any potential low level bacterial potentiation.
