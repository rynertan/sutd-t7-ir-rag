# Medical vascular guide wire and self guiding type catheter.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a medical vascular guide wire made of a synthetic resin hollow monofilament. The guide wire com prises a tip part, a flexible part having a smaller diameter than the other parts, a tapering part and a manipulating part, these four parts continuously forming a line, in that order, along the monofilament axis. At least the tip part and the manipulating part have X ray impermeable material inserted in the respec tive hollows thereof. Disclosed is also a self guiding type catheter made of a synthetic resin multi hollow monofilament. The catheter comprises a tip part, a flexible part having a smaller diameter than the other parts, a tapering part and a manipulating part, these four parts continuously formed a line, in that order, along the monofilament axis. The catheter has at least two hollows extending at least from one end of the manipulating part to the tapering part or to the other end of the manipulat ing part or to a point in close proximity to said other end of the manipulating part. At least one of the hollows has an X ray impermeable material inserted at least within the hollow in the manipulating part, and the other hollow or at least one of the other hollows forms a pasageway for a liquid and or a gas.
