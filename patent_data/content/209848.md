Other Antihypertensive Agents aminophylline cryptenamine acetates and tannates deserpidine meremethoxylline procaine pargyline trimethaphan camsylate and the like, as well as admixtures and combinations thereof. Typically, the individual daily dosages for these combinations can range from about one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly. Coadministration is most readily accomplished by combining the active ingredients into a suitable unit dosage form containing the proper dosages of each. Other methods of coadministration are, of course, possible. The novel peptides of the present invention possess an excellent degree of activity in treating hypertension and congestive heart failure and they may be orally active. For these purposes the compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjutants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warmblooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, dogs, cats, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective in the treatment of humans. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The peptides of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Dosage levels of the order of 0.1 to 4.0 grams per day parenterally are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions. Oral doses are 3 10 times higher. For example, reninassociated hypertension and hyperaldosteronism are effectively treated parenterally by the administration of from 1.0 to 50 milligrams of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a pharmaceutical composition for treating hypertension and congestive heart failure, comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the formula I. Also, in accordance with the present invention there is still further provided a method of treating hypertension and congestive heart failure, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the formula I. The renin inhibitory peptides of the present invention may also be utilized in diagnostic methods for the purpose of establishing the significance of renin as a causative or contributory factor in hypertension or congestive heart failure in a particular patient. For this purpose the present peptides may be administered in a single dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per kg of body weight. Both in vivo and in vitro methods may be employed. In the in vivo method, a novel peptide of the present invention is administered to a patient, preferably by intravenous injection, although other routes of parenteral administration are also suitable, at a hypotensive dosage level and as a single dose, and there may result a transitory fall in blood pressure. This fall in blood pressure, if it occurs, indicates supranormal plasma renin levels. Some of the peptides of formula I also have angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitor activity. This activity augments renin inhibition in lowering blood pressure and in treating congestive heart failure. The compounds of the present invention, characterized by formula I may be viewed as a peptide segment A B D linked through an amide bond to a phosphcrus containing component designated as E. The preparation of these compounds is illustrated in the examples below, and in general proceeds as follows 1. The phosphorus containing unit E is prepared as outlined in the schemes below. In general, the unit G is incorporated into an intermediate E G during or after this process. Then an amino prctecting group is removed from E G.2. The unit A B D is coupled to E G in one of the following ways a Coupling of an amino protected form of D to E G, followed by amino protecting group removal from D E G and coupling of A B to the deprotected amino group of D E G. b Coupling of A B D, prepared by known techniques as illustrated in the examples to follow, to E G by known coupling procedures. The units E and G may contain functionality which requires protection during synthesis of E and coupling of E to G. Protecting groups, among those well known in peptide synthesis, are chosen so as to be compatable with these steps and so as to allow selective deprotection of the amino function in the unit E, which is then to be coupled to the A B D portion of the peptide. The phosphorus containing component E, as well as the amino acid side chains of B and D may likewise contain functionality which requires protection during the subsequent coupling reactions.Again, protecting groups are chosen so as to be compatable with the coupling steps, yet easily removable afterwards. In general, the carbobenzoxy group CBZ is used to protect the amino function inE which becomes coupled to the A B D unit. Other amino groups are protected with t butoxycarbonyl BOC , 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl FMOC and benzyl BZ groups. Carboxylic acids are protected as the methyl, ethyl, benzyl, or t butyl esters. Phosphonic acids are protected as the methyl, ethyl, t butyl, or benzyl esters. The peptide couping procedures referred to above include those brought about by use of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide l hydroxybenzotriazole and of disuccinimido oxallate K. Takeda et al,Tetrahedron Lett., 24, 4451 54 1983 .When the B or D units are N methylamino acids, or when the amino group of the unit E which is to be coupled to A B D bears an N methyl group R6 CH3 , procedures well known in peptide synthesis are used to prepare the A B D segments and to couple this unit to E orE G. In general, the mixed anhydride procedure with pivaloyl chloride and N methylmorpholine is used, as illustrated by R. M. Wenger, Helv. Chem. Acta., 1984, 67, 502 525. N methylamino acids can be prepared by the method of M. J. O Donnell et al., TetrahedronLett., 1984, 25, 3651. Preparation of the phosphorus containing components E are carried out as illustrated in the examples to follow.

J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans 1, 2845 53 1984 . Compounds derived from both the optically active and racemic materials are claimed in the present invention. The l aminoalkylphosphonic acids used in the examples below are prepared as described and can be resolved to give the optically active materials by the procedure of Kafarski et al, Can. J. Chem., 60, 3081 84 1982 , or can be prepared in optically active form by the method of Huber et al, TetrahedronLett. 3049 52 1979 . Compounds derived from both the optically active and racemic materials are claimed in the present invention. The following schemes and examples illustrate the preparation of peptides of formula I.
