# Chlorosulphonated polysulphones, their preparation and their use in preparing sulphonated polysulphones.

## Abstract
A chlorosulphonated polyaryl ether sulphone resin, in which the polyaryl ether sulphone is linear or branched and comprises a plurality of repeating units of the formula Ar₁ SO₂ Ar₂ L wherein L is a linking radical and Ar₁ and Ar₂ are the same or different phenylene radicals optionally substituted with non deactivating groups and in which some at least of the same or different phenylene radicals are substituted with hydroxysulphonyl groups and chlorosulphonyl groups, the ratio of chlorosulphonyl groups to hydroxysulphonyl groups is from 0.01 1 to 20 1, and the combined contents of hydroxysulphonyl and chlorosulphonyl groups are from 0.05 to 4 meq g of dry resin. The resin may be prepared by reaction of a polyaryl ether sulphone with chlorosulphonic acid. The resin may be hydrolysed to form a sulphonated polysulphone, or reacted with an amine, haloalkane or alcohol, to give an ion exchange resin material.
