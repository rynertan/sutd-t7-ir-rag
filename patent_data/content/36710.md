# Phenanthrene based polyimide resin.

## Abstract
A polyimide resin is made by converting a phenanthrene to its 9, 10 diol derivative, reacting the derivative with formalde hyde to give a methylene bridged reaction product, oxidising the reaction product to produce a polycarboxylated product, and reacting the polycarboxylated product with an aromatic di amine to form the polyimide resin. The invention also includes the resin, the reaction product and the polycarboxylated pro duct. The resin will be useful as a lamp capping cement, a high temperature insulator, in copper clad printed circuit boards, in glass or asbestor laminates for use as compressor blades.
