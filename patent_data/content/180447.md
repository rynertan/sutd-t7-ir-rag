## Description
A SURROUND ASSEMBLY FOR A WINDOW OR DOOR FRAMEThe invention relates to a surround assembly for a window or door frame. The invention also relates to a window sill.The term surround as used in this Specification refers to the frame of an opening between a door frame or window frame and a surrounding wall. The term reveal as used in this Specification refers to the side and top frame of such an opening.In one aspect the invention relates to a support assembly for a window or door frame comprising a pair of upright reveal members and a cross reveal member extending between the upright reveal members.When the walls of a building are being constructed openings are left into which window or door frames are subsequently fitted. In the case of window frames these openings include recesses for reception of a window sill.After the wall has been built the sill is inserted to its recesses and a window frame is mounted on the sill and fixed to the wall. With the window in place timber formwork is built up around the opening to define the outer extremities and thickness of an outer window reveal. With the formwork in position the window reveals are then formed by plastering around the opening up to the level and thickness defined by the formwork. When the plaster has fully dried, the formwork is removed and the joint between the window and the reveal is filled with a suitable sealing compound such as mastic.There are many problems associated with this conventional method for forming reveals. In particular, the setting up of the timber formwork which is used to define the reveal which it is desired to form requires a skilled workman and is generally a time consuming operation. In forming the reveal, one is again relying on the skill of the plasterer and the uniformity of the mixture being used to ensure that the reveals are correctly formed. Further, because the plaster is applied as a wet mix the job of forming the window reveals cannot generally be done in wet weather and after the reveal has been formed and before the plaster has set, any water falling on the reveal will adversely affect the plaster mix affecting the surface finish and structural strength of the reveals. Such defects may not be apparent for some considerable time after the reveal has been formed.Further, as the plaster usually takes some days to set adequately the formwork must be left in position over this period thus possibly delaying completion of other work in the general area of the opening. In addition, to avoid damaging the newly formed reveal the formwork must be very carefully removed to avoid chipping or cracking the reveal.Another problem with conventional reveals is that as they are exposed to the weather they require regular maintenance to ensure that no ingress of air or moisture occurs.While the previous description of prior art techniques has referred to the formation of a window reveal, it will be appreciated that substantially similar comments apply to the formation of a reveal for a door frame opening except that a sill portion is not generally used in conjunction with a surround for a door.There is therefore a need for an improved surround assembly for a window or door frame which will overcome at least some of these disadvantages and difficulties.In one aspect this invention is directed towards providing such an improved surround assembly for a window or door frame.This invention is characterised in that the reveal members are preformed members and in that the assembly includes an engagement means for engaging the cross reveal member with the upright reveal members. The advantages of the invention are many. Amongst the principal advantages are that because the reveal members are preformed, it is possible to use reveal members formed from any suitable material such as a plastics or metal material For example, the reveal members may be formed from ultra violet resistant plastics material such as a u.P.V.C. In the case of metals typically the reveal members may be of aluminium or light weight steel material.Because the reveal members are preformed they can be quickly installed by unskilled workmen. Thus, the overall cost of the reveal assembly would be considerably less than with conventional reveal assemblies.In addition, such materials require only minimum maintenance.Further, as the reveal members are preformed, there is no delay from the time the reveal members are put in position to the time when other work can be carried on in the general area of the opening.Another advantage is that as the reveal members are preformed they can be formed with any desired shape or style.For example, the reveal members may be formed to similate a Georgian style facade. Because an engagement means is used between the reveal members the assembly can be easily fitted together on site.In a particularly preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention the engagement means comprises a pair of corner members.The principal advantage of using corner members as an engagement means is that they can be used to introduce a tolerance into the assembly so that the reveal assembly can accomodate any irregularities in the opening. Further, the use of such corner members allows the reveal members to independently expand and contract as ambient temperature rises and falls. In addition, because such corner members are used the reveal members may be of simpler and hence cheaper construction than if the engagement means were incorporated as an integral part of the reveal members rather than a separate item.Preferably each of the corner members is of substantiallyL shape when viewed in front elevation and each corner member includes a transverse leg and an interconnected upright leg, the transverse leg having a transverse engagement means for engagement with the cross reveal member and the upright leg having an upright engagement means for engagement with the upright reveal member. The advantages of this particular arrangement of corner member is that it is relatively easily formed and is easy to use on installation while still providing adequate interlocking between the reveal members and allowing independent movement between the reveal members to accomodate expansion and contraction.Typically the transverse engagement means and upright engagement means of each corner member define sockets for engaging with complementary shaped mating spigots formed by the upright and cross reveal members. The particular advantage of using such a spigot and socket type joint is that such joint may be described as all embracing so that there is a relatively large interface area between the component parts thus giving a large area for distribution of any load forces applied and also a larger sealing area at the joint. Such spigot and socket type joints are also easily assembled and disassembled as required.In one embodiment of the invention each reveal member comprises a side wall portion which defines the spigot.The particular advantage of this arrangement is that the construction of the reveal member is relatively simple as there is no requirement for complicated and hence expensive cross sections at the joint. Preferably the side wall portion is cranked at one end and turned back on itself.One advantage of this arrangement of the side wall portion is that it defines a channel shaped section which can be used for aligning reveal members in position relative the opening. Further, this arrangement has added structural strength.In one embodiment of the invention each reveal member, and preferably also each corner member, includes an alignment flange which projects laterally from the members to engage a surrounding frame.The advantages of such an alignment flange are many.Firstly, it defines a relatively large alignment interface area between the reveal, and preferably also the corner members, and the surround of an opening.Such a flange also acts as a moisture barrier to prevent ingress of moisture at the joint between the reveal and the frame of the opening. Further, the flange also acts as a keying means for keying the assembly to the rendering plaster applied to the outer surface of the wall surrounding the opening. To facilitate this keying the flange may be formed with any suitable keying means including ribs, apertures and the like.Preferably the alignment flange defines, together with the cranked portion of the side wall portion of the reveal member a box shaped front reveal portion.One advantage of this arrangement is that the flange in combination with a portion of the reveal member side wall defines a shape which is particularly rigid in use.Another advantage is that it adds to the thickness of the reveal member when viewed from the front, giving a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. Preferably the flange is movable relative the side wall portion to accomodate expansion and or contraction of the assembly.As expansion and contraction of the reveal assembly occurs in accordance with changes in ambient temperature levels it is preferable to allow parts of the reveal members to be independently movable to allow such expansion and contraction to be accomodated without stressing the assembly. The alignment flange, for example, may be a snap fit onto the side wall of the reveal member, the particular snap fitting being designed with a ramp which allows the reveal sidewall to move laterally a small amount while still snap fittingly engaging with the flange.In addition, such an alignment flange provides a member through which fixing means such as screws or bolts may be driven to fix the assembly to a wall surrounding an opening. In one embodiment of the invention the assembly includes a clip for attaching the reveal members to a surrounding frame.One advantage of such a clip is that it allows the assembly to be quickly and easily fitted in position to a frame such as a window frame.To ensure that no moisture or air ingress occurs at the joint between the clip and the reveal member, typically a seal is provided at this joint.For ease of attachment typically the clip engages with a complementary grip portion formed at the end of the reveal member remote from the box shaped front portion.In one case the surround assembly is a window reveal assembly and the assembly also includes a preformed window sill.In one embodiment of the invention the sill comprises an outer sill and an interconnected inner sill. Usually such inner and outer sills are both formed and installed separately however again for ease of installation in this case the assembly includes both an inner and outer sill. Preferably both the inner and outer sills are formed with complementary interengagable formations which preferably constitute a snap in fitting. Such formations on the inner and outer sill allow the parts to be easily and quickly interengaged, in use.To accomodate varying desired depths of inner sill or window board the inner sill may be formed with a plurality of spaced apart formations so that the inner sill can be easily cut to a desired depth while still being provided with a suitable formation for engaging for example, by snap fitting with the outer sill.In another embodiment of the invention the outer sill comprises a bottom wall, upstanding front and rear walls and a top wall having an outer, downwardly inclined, front portion, and a window receiving portion interconnected by a step portion, air ventilation means being provided in the sill.One advantage of the provision of such air ventilation means is to reduce condensation on the inside of the window frame and glass.Preferably the air ventilation means comprises an inner ventilation aperture in the sill bottom wall usually adjacent the front edge of the wall communicating with an outlet ventilation aperture, usually in the top wall, which is disposed inside the window receiving portion thereof. One advantage of this particular configuration of air ventilation means is that it is easily formed in the sill and prevents an excessive draught through the ventilation means.Preferably a valving means is provided for varying the flow of air through the air ventilation means.The particular advantage of the use of such a valving means is in allowing the flow of ventilating air to be easily controlled.Preferably the outlet ventilation aperture comprises a plurality of spaced apart ventilation holes and the valving means comprises a slider plate having a plurality of through holes which are progressively moved into and out of line with the outlet ventilation holes in the sill top wall to vary the flow of ventilating air. One advantage of this arrangement of outlet aperture and valving means is that it is relatively easy to form and is easy to operate while providing a control flow of ventilating air to reduce condensation on the inside of the window.In another embodiment of the invention the sill includes a keying means for engagement of the sill with a surrounding frame. A particular advantage of the use of such a keying means is that it assists in possitively locating and fixing the sill in position with respect to the surrounding frame.The keying means may for example comprise a groove such as a dovetail shaped groove for engagement with the surrounding frame. The groove is typically filled with a plaster material which is placed on top of the wall defining the bottom of the frame, the plaster being forced into the groove to key the sill to the surrounding frame. In a further embodiment of the invention the sill also includes an alignment means which has the advantage of allowing the sill to be easily aligned with respect to the surrounding frame on installation. Preferably the alignment means is formed by a flange which extends downwardly from the bottom wall of the sill. Such a flange provides a large interface area between the sill and surrounding frame to facilitate alignment of the sill with respect to the frame. The flange also provides a barrier against moisture and air ingress at the joint between the sill and the surrounding frame. Further, the flange forms a keying means for keying the sill to the wall surrounding the frame opening. To facilitate keying the flange may be formed with suitable keying ribs, apertures or the like. In a further embodiment of the invention the sill includes means for directing water falling on the outer sill away from the sill.The particular advantage of such a means for directing water away from the sill is that it assists in preventing water ingress at the joint between the sill and the surrounding frame.In one case the means for directing water failing on the outer sill away from the sill comprises a drip lip extending downwardly from the bottom wall of the sill, usually adjacent the front edge thereof.One advantage of such a drip lip is that it gathers all water falling on the outer sill into a small area where it accumulates quickly and falls away from the sill.In a still further embodiment of the invention the sill includes condensate drainage means for directing condensate to the outside of a window.The particular advantage of such a condensate drainage means is in taking away any condensate which forms on the inside of the window before it has an opportunity to lodge in the window frame or in the joint between the sill and frame. Preferably the condensate drainage means comprises a condensate collecting groove having a plurality of inlet apertures communicating with a condensate outlet provided in the sill. This arrangement facilitates collection and run off of condensate which may form on the inside of a window. In another aspect the invention relates to G window sill having a bottom wall, upstanding front and rear walls and a top wall having an outer downwardly inclined front portion and an interconnected window receiving portion.Conventional window sills are generally preformed from concrete or similar materials. Particularly for largesized openings such sills are very difficult to handle because of their unwieldly shape and weight. For example, in the case of a typical 6 6 wide window opening, it takes up to four men or machinery to handle and install a conventional sill in the opening.Another problem with conventional window sills is that because they are generally formed from concrete or similar material they require regular maintenance and can be easily damaged. Further, due to deficiencies in molding techniques such conventional window sills often include a large number of voids through which heat loss occurs and ingress of moisture and air can also occur.A further problem is that with conventional windows, particularly of the double glazed type there is a tendency for condensation to occur on the inside of the window and the condensate flows onto the inner sill or window board which causes rotting of the window board and dampness in the walls surrounding the window over a relatively short timespan. Another problem with conventional window sills Is that they are generally difficult to align in the correct position in an opening. This is particularly the case not only because various measurements and adjustments must be made but also because the sill is generally installed on a bed of mortar and the more movement of the sill on the mortar bed, the more water will be produced at the surface of the mortar due to a trowelling action hence the sill tends to slide on the mortar.A further problem with conventional window sills is that despite their shape which is intended to direct water falling on the sill away from the sill there is a tendancy for water to travel into the joint between the sill and surrounding frame and thus, water ingress can occur with consequent structure of problems including dampness in the walls.One embodiment of this aspect of the invention is characterised in that the sill includes air ventilation means, preferably the air ventilation means comprising an inlet ventilation aperture in the sill bottom wall usually adjacent a front edge thereof, and communicating with an inlet ventilation aperture usually the top wall, which is disposed inside the window receiving portion.One advantage of the provision of such an air ventilation means is to reduce condensation on the inner side of window.Preferably the air ventilation means comprises an inner ventilation aperture in the sill bottom wall usually adjacent the front edge of the wall communicating with an outlet ventilation aperture, usually in the top wall, which is disposed inside the window receiving portion thereof.One advantage of this particular configuration of air ventilation means is that it is easily formed in the sill and prevents an excessive draught through the ventilation means.Preferably a valving means is provided for varying the flow of air through the air ventilation means.The particular advantage of the use of such a valving means is in allowing the flow of ventilating air to be easily controlled.Preferably the outlet ventilation aperture comprises a plurality of spaced apart ventilation holes and the valving means comprises a slider plate having a plurality of through holes which are progressively moved into and out of line with the outlet ventilation holes in the sill top wall to vary the flow of ventilating air. One advantage of this arrangement of outlet aperture and valving means is that it is relatively easy to form and is easy to operate while providing a control flow of ventilating air to reduce condensation on the inside of the window.In another embodiment the invention is characterised in that the sill includes a keying means for engagement of the sill with the surrounding frame. A particular advantage of the use of such a keying means is that it assists in possitively binding and fixing the sill in position with respect to the surrounding frame. The keying means may for example comprise a groove such as a dovetail shaped groove for engagement with the surrounding frame. The groove is typically filled with a plaster material which is placed on top of the wall defining the bottom of the frame, the plaster being forced into the groove to key the sill to the surrounding frame.A further embodiment of this aspect of the invention is characterised in that the sill also includes an alignment means which has the advantage of allowing the sill to be easily aligned with respect to the surrounding frame on installation. Preferably the alignment means is formed by a flange which extends downwardly from the bottom wall of the sill. Such a flange provides a large interface area between the sill and surrounding frame to facilitate alignment of the sill with respect to the frame. The flange also provides a barrier against moisture and air ingress at the joint between the sill and the surrounding frame. Further, the flange forms a keying means for keying the sill to the wall surrounding the frame opening. To facilitate keying the flange may be formed with suitable keying ribs, apertures or the like.In a further embodiment the invention is characterised in that the sill includes means for directing water falling on the outer sill away from the sill.The particular advantage of such a means for directing water away from the sill is that it assists in preventing water ingress at the joint between the sill and the surrounding frame.In one case the means for directing water falling on the outer sill away from the sill comprises a drip lip extending downwardly from the bottom wall of the sill, usually adjacent the front edge thereof.One advantage of such a drip lip is that it gathers all water falling on the outer sill into a small area where it accumulates quickly and falls away from the sill.In a still further embodiment the invention is characterised in that the sill includes condensate drainage means for directing condensate to the outside of a window. The particular advantage of such a condensate drainage means is in taking away any condensate which forms on the inside of the window before it has an opportunity to lodge in the window frame or in the joint between the sill and frame.Preferably the condensate drainage means comprises a condensate collecting groove having a plurality of inlet apertures communicating with a condensate outlet provided in the sill. This arrangement facilitates collection and run off of condensate which may form on the inside of a window.In a further embodiment the invention is characterised in that the inner and outer sills are formed with complementary interengagable formations which preferably constitute a snap in fitting. Such an arrangement allows a window sill to be quickly and easily fitted. The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description thereof given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a perspective, partially cut away view of a surround assembly according to the invention, Fig. 2 is a perspective view, from the rear, of a top corner portion of the assembly of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view in the direction of the arrows III III in Fig. 2, Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view in the direction of the arrows IV IV in Fig. 2, Fig. 5 is a perspective, exploded, view of the top corner portion of Fig. 2, Fig. 6 is a perspective view, from the front, of the top corner portion of Fig. 2, Fig. 7 is an exploded view of the assembly of Fig. 6, Fig. 8 is a cross sectional view of a reveal member forming part of the assembly, Fig. 9 is a plan, partially cross sectional view of portion of the assembly, Fig. 10 is a cross sectional view of a seal for use at a joint between a reveal member and a sill of the assembly, Fig. 11 is a cross sectional view of a seal for use at a joint between a reveal member of the ass embly and a window or door frame, Fig. 12 is a perspective, partially sectional view of a bottom corner portion of the assembly,Fig. 13 is a side, cross sectional view of the bottom portion of the assembly of Fig. 12,Fig. 14 is a perspective view of an outer sill end cap forming part of the assembly,Fig. 15 is a perspective view illustrating the end cap of Fig. 14 in use,Fig. 16 is an exploded view of a portion of an inner sill forming part of the assembly,Fig. 17 is a perspective view of a reveal member forming a part of another surround assembly,Fig. 18 is a plan, cross sectional view of the reveal member of Fig. 17, in use,Fig. 19 is a cross sectional view on an enlarged scale in the direction of the arrows XX XX in Fig. 18,Fig. 20 is a cross sectional view on an enlarged scale in the direction of the arrows XXI XXI in Fig. 18, andFig. 21 is a perspective view of a further reveal member. Referring to the drawings there is illustrated a surround assembly according to the invention. The surround assembly is in this case a surround assembly for a window 1 and includes a hollow window sill 2, a pair of spaced apart upright reveal members 3,4 mounted on the sill 2 and a top cross or lintel reveal member 5 extending between the upright reveal members 3,4. All parts of the assembly are preformed and in this case are of extrusion molded plastics material such as ultra violet resistant polyvinyl chloride material.Referring particularly to Figs. 2 to 7 the assembly includes engagement means for engaging the cross reveal member 5 with the upright reveal members 3,4 and in the case the engaging means comprises a pair of corner members 6,7, one associated with each upright reveal member 3,4. The corner members 6,7 are of substantiallyL shape when viewed in front elevation and include a transverse leg 8 for engagement with the cross reveal member 5 and an upright leg 9 for engagement with an upright reveal member 3 or 4. Each corner member 6,7 includes a front portion 10 and a rearwardly projecting elongate portion 11, the front portion 10 including a front wall 12 and a pair of rearwardly projecting perpendicularly arranged side walls 13, 14.A firstL shaped bracket 15 is connected to the inner surface of the side wall 13 and defines together with the side wall 13 a slot shaped socket 16 ito which a portion of an upright reveal member 3 engages as will be described in more detail below. A second L shaped bracket 17 is connected to the side wall 14 and extends to define together with the side wall 14 another elongate slotshaped socket 18 for reception of portion of the cross reveal member 5 as will be described in more detail below. The elongate portion 11 of the corner member 6 comprises an inner substantially L shaped elongate member 20 which extends from the front wall 12 of the front portion 10 and an outer L shaped elongate member 21 which is spaced apart from the inner elongate member 20 to define a first elongate slot shaped socket 22 for reception of a portion of the upright reveal member 3 and a second elongate slot shaped socket 23 for reception of a portion of the cross reveal member 5. An elongate connecting rib 25 extends between the outer corner of the inner elongate member 20 and the inner corner of the outer elongate member 21. A substantially L shaped alignment flange 27 extends sidewardly from the edges of the side walls 13,14 of the front portion 10 of the corner piece. The flange 27 is formed with outwardly facing keying ribs 28 for keying to plaster.It will be noted that the outer L shaped member 21 extends to a position spaced apart from the flange 27 to accomodate the reveal members 4,5 as on assembly.The joint between the corner members 6,7 and the reveal members 3,4,5 is of the spigot and socket type and each of the reveal members 3,4,5 comprises a side wall 30 which defines the spigot which is received by the socket portions 16,18,22,23 of the corner members 6,7.The side wall 30 is cranked at a front end 31 thereof and turned back on itself to define a substantiallyU shaped channel. An alignment and fixing flange 32 extends latterally from the side wall 30 and includes a projecting tongue 33 which engages in a complementary channel 34 of the side wall 30 and a sidewardly projecting formation 35 which snap fittingly engages a complementary shaped formation 36 provided at the free end of the side wall 30. It will be apparent that the joint between the flange 32 and the reveal member 3,4,5 facilitates independent movement between the flange and reveal member to accomodate expansion and contraction of the reveal assembly in use. The flange 32 assists in aligning and positioning the reveal assembly in use and is formed with a plurality of spaced apart fixing holes 37 along the length thereof through which fixing screws or bolts are used to fix the flange 32 to the walls surrounding an opening in which the assembly is mounted. In addition, the flange 32 acts as a moisture barrier preventing ingress of air and water at the joint between the opening and the reveal assembly. The flange 32 also acts as a keying means for keying the reveal assembly to an outer layer of plaster or rendering applied to the walls surrounding the opening. To facilate the keying action the front surface of the flange 32 is formed with a plurality of keying ribs 38.The reveal member side wall 30 is formed with a grip portion 40 remote from the box shaped front portion thereof which in use engages with complementary fixing clips 41 which in use are fixed to a window frame 1To prevent moisture ingress at the joint between the clips 41 and the reveal members, the reveal may alternatively include a suitable seal such as an O ring seal or a blob of mastic or similar sealing compound. Similarly the joint between the window frame and the reveal members 3,4,5 is also sealed either with a mastic or other sealing compound or a rubber seal such as the seal 43 illustrated in Figs. 8 and 11.The upright reveal members 3,4 are supported on the sill 2 and the joint between the sill 2 and the reveal members 3,4 is sealed with any suitable sealing means such as mastic or similar material or by a shaped seal ing strip of rubber material 44 including a channel 45 into which the outermost extremities of the upright reveal members 3,4 are inserted, as will be apparent from Fig. 10. Referring particularly to Figs. 1, 12 and 13 the sill 2 comprises an outer sill 50 and an interconnected inner sill 51. The sills 50,51 are formed with complementary interengagable formations 52,53 which constitute a snap in fitting. It will be noted that the inner sill 51 is formed with a plurality of spaced apart formations 53 so that inner sill 51 can be cut from a preformed section to the desired depth and the appropriate formation 53 engaged in the formation 52 in the outer sill 50. The outer sill 50 comprises a bottom wall 55 upstanding front and rear walls 56,57 and a top wall 58 having an outer, downwardly inclined front portion 59 and a window receiving portion 60 interconnected by a step portion 61. The sill 50 is of hollow construction and a plurality of transverse webs 62 extend between the top and bottom walls 58, 55. The outer sill 50 is formed with air ventilation means comprising an inlet ventil ation aperture formed from a plurality of inlet vent ilation holes 63 in the sill bottom wall 55 adjacent the front edge thereof and communicating with an outlet ventilation aperture in the form of plurality of outlet holes 64 provided in the sill top wall 58 in a portion 65 thereof which is inside the window 1 and which is angularly disposed to direct ventilation air onto the inner surface of the window 1.The ventilation air passes through holes or slots 66 provided in the reinforcing webs 62. Valving means for controlling the flow of ventilation air through the outlet ventilation holes 64 is in this case provided by a slider plate 70 which is mounted in a channel 71 below the portion 65 of the sill top wall 58 and is slidably movable in the channel 71 by operating a handle 72 which projects upwardly through the sill top wall portion 65 as will be apparant from Figs. 12 and 13. The slider plate 70 is formed with a plurality of through holes 73 which are moved into and out of alignment with the outlet ventilation holes 64 on movement of the slider plate 70 to control the flow of ventilation air.In addition to assisting in preventing condensation on the window 1 it is anticipated that the ventilation means may also be used to provide general ventilation air for a room thus replacing conventional ventilation apertures which are generally provided in locations which are generally inaccessible, such as above a doorway. The flow of ventilation air is indicated by double headed arrows A inFig. 13.The sills 50,51 include keying means for engagement of the sills with a surrounding frame. In the case of the outer sill 50 the keying means include an elongate dovetail shaped groove 75 provided in the bottom wall 55 of the sill which in use engages with a bed of mortar for keying the sill to the frame. Keying is also provided by an alignment flange 76 which extends downwardly from the sill bottom wall 55. The outer surface of the flange 76 is formed with a plurality of keying ribs 77 to which an outer layer of mortar or rendering is keyed. The flange 76 also assists, on installation, in aligning and positioning the window sill on a wall.In addition, the flange 76 defines a moisture barrier which prevents ingress of moisture at the joint between the sill and the surrounding wall. Additional keying means are provided by keying flanges 77,78 which extend rearwardly from the rear wall 57 of the outer sill SO. It will be noted that the upper of the keying flanges 78, defines, together with a portion of the projecting formation 52 constituting a snap in fitting for reception of the inner sill, defines a slot which may also be used to accomodate a conventional window board or inner sill, for example of wooden material.The keying means for keying the inner sill in position is provided not only by the formations 53 on the underside of the sill 51 but also by a downwardly projecting keying flange 80 including keying ribs 81 for keying to an innerlayer of plaster. It will be noted that the portion of the inner sill 51 overhangs a wall on which the sill is mounted is substantially box shaped for added rigidity. The outer sill SO also includes condensate drainage means for directing condensation from a window 1 to the outside of the sill. In this case the condensate drainage means comprises a condensate collecting groove 85 having a plurality of inlet apertures 86 through which condensate passes and communicating via a connecting web 87 extending between the step portion 61 and a web 62 of the sill 50 to plurality of condensate outlet holes 88 provided in the portion of the step 61 of the sill.It will be appreciated that the condensate inlet holes 86,8or are offset to prevent draughts of air entering through the condensate drainage channel and possibly blowing condensate back through the inlet holes 86. The flow of condensate is indicated by the arrows B inFig. 13.It will be noted that the upper wall of the step portion 61 of the sill 50 is formed with a pair of spaced apart elongate dovetail grooves 90 for reception of a suitable seal 91 to seal the joint between the step portion of the sill and a window 1. The seal 91 may be of any suitable type for example a rubber seal but is preferably of a mastic or similar sealing compound.Means for directing water falling on the outer sill away from the sill is in this case provided by a drip lip 95 which extends downwardly from the bottom wall 55 of the sill 50 adjacent the front edges thereof. Water falling on the top wall 58 of the sill flows downwardly over the front wall 56 and collects on the drip lip 95 where it drops to the ground. The drip lip 95 includes a ramp 96 to prevent water rising up behind the lip 95 and entering the inlet ventilation holes 63.Referring particularly to Figs. 14 to 16 it will be noted that the ends of the inner and outer sills 50,51 are closed by end caps 96,97 respectively which clip on to the si ls. The outer sill end caps 96 are provided with expansion and contraction accomodating means in the form of a pad 98 of any suitable material, the outer surface of which, in use, bears against the surrounding walls of the opening in which the sill is placed, as will be apparant from Fig. 15, to accomodate expansion and contraction of the sill due to changes in the ambient temperature levels. It will also be apparant from Fig. 15 that the end caps 96 include an outer upwardly extending stool portion 99 which directs any water falling on the top wall 58 of the sill 50 away from the joint between the sill and surrounding wall.In use, and referring particularly to Figs. 1, 12 and 13 a surround assembly such as the window reveal assembly described above with generally be provided in the form of a pack comprising the inner and outer sills 50,51 with their end caps 96,97 attached the two upright reveal members 3,4 and the cross reveal member 5 as well as auxilliary equipment including the clips 41 and the various seals or mastic as required. In the particular instance which is illustrated in the drawings the wall in which an opening is left is a cavity wall comprising inner and outer leaves which are spaced apart to define a cavity therebetween. Soft mortar is first placed on the outer and inner leaves and the outer sill 50 is placed thereon. The sill 50 is then manipulated until the alignment flange 76 bears against the outer surface of the outer leaf.The sill 50 is then pressed into the mortar so that the mortar fills the dovetail keying groove 75. Mastic 91 or any suitable sealing agent is then placed in the dovetail keying grooves 90 provided in the raised portion 60 of the sill and the clips 41 for the reveal members 3,4,5, are fixed to the top and two sides of the window 1. The window 1 is then placed on the raised portion 60 of the sill and is secured to the inner and outer leaves of the wall in a conventional manner.The reveal is then assembled by engaging the upright and cross reveal members 3,4,5, together using the corner members 6,7. The reveal assembly is then pushed into position until the alignment flanges 32, 27 on the reveal members 3,4,5 and the corner members 6,7 bear against the outer surface of the outer leaf of the wall and the grip portions 40 of the reveal members are snap fittingly engaged with the clips 41. The joint between the sill and the lower portion of the upright reveal members 3,4, is then sealed using any suitable sealing compound such as a mastic sealing compound.Alternatively a seal such as the seal 44 is attached to the lower portion of the upright reveal members 4,5 prior to insertion of the reveal assembly. Similarly the joint between the reveal members 3,4,5 and the window 1 is sealed with a suitable mastic sealing compound or by using the preformed sealing strip 43.Finally, the inner sill 51 is cut to the required depth and positioned by snap fitting into engagement with the outer sill 50 until the alignment flange bears against the inner face of the inner leaf of the wall.The outer face of the outer leaf of the wall and the inner face of the inner leaf may then be plastered up, the alignment flanges 27,32,80 being keyed to the plaster by the keying means and hence to the leaves of the wall.As mentioned previously the components of the sill and the reveal assembly are generally of a suitable ultraviolet resistant plastics material such as u.P.V.C. and the assembly will require only minimum maintenance to renew or reinforce the seals between the reveals and window frame and sill and reveals if required.It will be appreciated that while the surround assembly has been described with particular reference to a surround assembly for a window frame it may be applied to a surround assembly for a door frame in which case a sill portion is not required, the assembly comprising the upright and cross reveal members and corner reveal members, if used. Similarly, when the assembly is used for a window it is not essential that the window sill forms part of the assembly as a conventional window sill may be used. In addition, instead of using an inner and outer sill, an outer sill alone may be used in combination with a conventional inner sill or window board. It will further be appreciated, particularly in the case of a window, that the inner reveals may be formed in a similar manner to the outer reveals.It will further be appreciated that the outer window sill alone may be used as part of a window surround, the outer reveals being of conventional construction.It will further be appreciated that in the case of the upright and cross reveal members the alignment flange may be formed as an integral part of the members rather than as an independently movable part. The particular advantage however of having an independently movable part is to allow for expansion and contraction of the reveals due to changes in ambient temperatures.It will also be appreciated that for added rigidity the side wall of the reveal members may be of double leaf construction. Referring to Figs. 17 to 20 there is illustrated a reveal member 120 forming part of a surround assembly according to another embodiment of the invention. The reveal member 120 is in this case particularly adapted for use with brickwork and includes two keying grooves 121, 122 for reception of the heads 123, 124 of a fixing device 125 having four arms 126, 127, 128, 129. As will be apparant from Figs. 18 to 20 the cross section of the arms 126, 127 of the fixing device 125 which engage with the keying grooves 121, 122 are substantially of square cross section and one corner edge of the arms 126, 127 rests on the brickwork for positioning the device 125 on brickwork and keying to mortar. The other arms 128, 129 of the fixing device 125 are of oblong cross section to provide a relatively large contact area between the arms 127, 128, blockwork and mortar. Other features of the reveal member are substantially similar to the reveal members of the surround assembly described above with reference to Figs. 1 to 16 and like parts are assigned the same reference numerals.Referring to Fig. 21 there is illustrated a reveal member 130 forming part of another surround assembly according to the invention. The reveal member is again for use with brickwork and is substantially similar to the reveal member described above with reference to Figs. 17 to 20, like parts being assigned the same reference numerals. In this case the reveal member sidewall is of double leaf construction for added strength and rigidity.It will further be appreciated that the inner window sill may also be used as an inner reveal member.
