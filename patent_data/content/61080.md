# Ion exchange membrane electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
An ion exchange membrane electrolytic cell comprises an anode, a cathode, an anode compartment and a cathode compartment partitioned by an ion exchange membrane. A gas and liquid permeable porous non electrode layer com posed of non oxide ceramic particles is bonded to at least one side of the ion exchange membrane. With use of such a membrane, the cell voltage can be considerably reduced in the electrolysis of water, alkali metal halide, alkali metal carbonate, etc.
