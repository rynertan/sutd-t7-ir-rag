# A method of information recording on a semiconductor wafer.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is an informtion recording method in which a p or n type semiconductor wafer 3 is irradiated with an energetic particle beam such as an electron beam 5 there by to control, e.g. decrease or increase generation of the sur face photovoltage at the irradiated area so that information may be recorded on the wafer.
