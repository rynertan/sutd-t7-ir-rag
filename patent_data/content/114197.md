# ELECTRO OPTICAL KEYBOARD APPARATUS

## Abstract
A keyboard comprising a plurality of key assemblies 10 having a key lever 12 pivoting at one end 11 , having a key button 16 attached, and having a code flag member 20 attached by flexible means to the opposite end of the key levers. The code flag members have bar coded indicia 40 and include an end portion 24 which engages a striker bar 14 when the key lever is depressed to flex the flexible means so that the code flag member is moved into a position adjacent to a sensing means 22 which includes a light beam 28 directed to a single photodetector 30 . When fully depressed the end portion 24 slips off the striker bar 14 so that the code flag member snaps through the sensing assembly 22 thereby producing a series of pulses by the photodetector corresponding to the coded indicia for the actuated key assembly. When the actuated key assembly is manually released, the code flag member returns on a different path which does not go through the sensing assembly.
