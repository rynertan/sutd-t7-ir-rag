# Color picture tube provided with an inner magnetic shield.

## Abstract
An inner shield 26 made of a magnetic material for shielding the earth magnetism is provided in a color picture tube for preventing the mislanding of the electron beams on phosphor stripes that might oherwise result from the bend ing of the electron beams caused by the earth magnetism. The inner shield 26 is formed by securing a pair of short side sections 26 3, 26 4 and a pair of long side sections 26 1, 26 2 to a mask frame 20 such as to define a substantially rectangular space through which the electron beams pass. Gaps offering increased magnetic reluctance are provided beween the short side sections on one hand and the long side sections on the other hand, whereby the components of the horizonal earth magneic field vector are adjusted to cancel elecromagnetic forces acting upon the electron beams.
