# Cation exchange fluoropolymer membrane.

## Abstract
A cation exchange fluoropolymer membrane compris ing at least three integrally laminated layers including a main layer made of a perfluorocarbon polymer having carboxylic acid groups as its ion exchange groups with an ion exchange capacity of from 1.4 to 2.0 meq g dry resin and having a thickness of from 50 to 250 µm, a sulfonic acid film surface layer formed on one side of said main layer, made of a perfluorocarbon polymer having sulfonic acid groups as its ion exchange groups with an ion exchange capacity of from 0.5 to 1.5 meq g dry resin and having a thickness of from 5 to 50 m, and a carboxylic acid film surface layer formed on the other side of said main layer, made of a perfluorocarbon polymer having carboxylic acid groups as its ion exchange groups with an ion exchange capacity of from 0.5 to 1.3 meq g dry resin and having a thickness of from 5 to 50 µm, said sulfonic acid film surface layer and carboxylic acid film surface layer constituting the outer most layers, respectively.
