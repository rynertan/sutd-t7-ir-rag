Among the heterocyclic cage compounds I of the invention, those of the following formula Ia are preferable EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2 and X are each as defined above, All is a single bond or a methylene group, A21 is a methylene group or an ethylene group and A31 is a methylene group or an ethylene group. Particularly preferred are those of the following formula Ib EMI3.2 wherein A11 A211 A311 X and R1 are each as defined above and R21 is a hydrogen atom, a C1 C5 alkyl group, a C3 C5 alkenyl group or a C2 C5 alkoxycarbonyl group. More particularly preferred are those of the formula Ic EMI3.3 wherein A11 A21, A31 and R21 are each as defined above, R11 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 C5 alkyl group and X1 is O or S . More preferred are those of the following formula Id EMI4.1 wherein All, A21 and A31 are each as defined above. Concerning heterotricyclic cage compounds having a skeleton of the formula EMI4.2 wherein A2 and X are each as defined above, only a few compounds have hitherto been described1 and few study on their chemistry or synthesis has hitherto been done. That is, the following compounds were synthesized previously A M. Nakazaki, K. Naemura and Y. Kondo J. Org. Chem., 41, p. 1229 1979 report the preparation of the compound of the formula EMI4.3 B R.M. Moriarty and K. Kapadia TetrahedronLetters1 p. 1165 1964 report the preparation of the compounds of the formulae EMI5.1 andEMI5.2 C R.M. Moriarty, H. Gopal and T. Adams Tetrahedron Letters, p. 4003 1970 report the preparation of the compounds of the formulae EMI5.3 andEMI5.4 D R.M. Moriarty, C.R. Romain and T.O. Lovett J. Am. Chem. Soc., 89, p. 3927 1967 report the preparation of the compounds of the formulaeEMI5.5 andEMI5.6 E C.R. Johnson and W.D. Kingsbury J. Org.Chem., 38, p. 1803 1973 report the preparation of the compounds of the formulae EMI5.7 andEMI5.8 Under the situation as described above, the present inventors have studied and developed the synthesis of the said heterotricyclic cage compounds and also made search on their useful biological 1. activities. As the result, it has now been found that the novel heterotricyclic cage compounds I of the invention exhibit excellent antiviral activity. As reviewed by L. Weinstein in PharmacologicalBasis of Therapeutics L.S. Goodman A. Gilman, McMillianCompany , p. 1305 1307 1970 , very few agents have been found to have clinical applicability for antiviral drug although the search for substances that might be of use in the management of viral infections has been long and intensive. Idoxuridine, amantadine and methiazone, synthetic antivirals for clinical use, are described in said text. The heterotricyclic cage compound I of the invention may be employed to control, namely to treat and prevent viral infections caused by RNA type viruses such asMyxo group. As a clinically useful anti influenza A viral agent with a cage structure, amantadine of the following formula is already known cf. Merck Index, 9th, p. 367 368 EMI6.1 The amantadine is now marketed in U.S.A. as an anti influenza A viral agent. However, it possesses not only an antiviral activity but also strong effects on a central nervous system CNS . Based on such CNS effects, amantadine is now marketed as an anti parkinsonism agent in several countries including Japan, West Germany, United Kingdom and France. For antiviral agents, the CNS effects of amantadine is deemed as undesirable side effects. The heterotricyclic cage compounds I of the present invention are found to be very effective to inhibit the growth of influenza virus, but surprisingly, exerting no or almost no CNS effects. In addition, the toxicities of the heterotricyclic cage compound I are found to be significantly lower than those of amantadine. Thus, the hjeterotricyclic cage compounds I are very useful as antiviral agents with no or weak side effects or toxicities. Some of the heterotricyclic cage compounds I of the invention are also useful as intermediates for another type of the heterotricyclic cage compounds I . The heterotricyclic cage compounds I and their non toxic salts can be used for treatment of the viral infection of mammals caused by influenza virus or for prevention thereof. For this purpose, they can be administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The proportion of the agent administered is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen routeiof administration and standard biological practice. For example, they may be administered orally in solid forms, such as starch, mild sugar and so forth. They may be also administered orally in the form of solutions or injected parenterally. For parenteral administration, they may be used in the form of sterile solutions containing other solutes, for example, enough saline or glucose to make the solutions isotonic. The compounds I of the invention may be used in the form of pharmaceutical preparations appropriate for enteral or parenteral administration. Preferable excipients used therein are those which do not react with the compounds mentioned above, for example, water, gelatine, lactose, starch, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, talc, white petroleum jelly, vegetable oils, alcohol, benzyl alcohol, gums, polyalkylene glycols, or other known excipients for medicines. The pharmaceutical preparations may be in the form of tablets, powder, dragees sugar coated tablets , capsules, suppositories, liquids, elixirs, emulsions, suspensions, syrups, chocolate, candy, waters, chewing gum or the like. If desired, they are sterilized and or contain auxiliary substances such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, detergents or buffers.They may also additionally contain other therapeutically valuable substances e.g. other antiviral agents, chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, anti inflammatory agents, anti pyretics, analgesics, enzyme preparations or the like . The preparation of them are formulated by usual methods. They may be conjointly administered with a viral inhibitor such as interferon, interferon inducer or the like. The compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 of active component. The compositions of this invention may be administered enterally, parenterally or in the form of nasal and oral aerosol spray. The compositions of this invention are also effective in resisting as well as combatting viral infections when administered topically to the site of the infection or potential infection in the form of ointments, salves, lotions, creams, sprays, drops, etc. The amount of the active component in such useful compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage of 0.5 mg to 50 mg Kg day will be obtained. These compounds may be used systemically, more concretely, parenterally and noh parenterally, etc. and by a local application such as inhalation, topical application and dropping in the eye, etc., in the preparation form suitable for application such as liquid, ointment, powder, granule, mush, pellet, capsule, tablet, etc. by the addition of afore mentioned solvent, additives, carriers, etc. The heterotricyclic cage compounds I of this invention can be prepared by the following methods Method A The compound of the formula Ie EMI9.1 wherein A1, A2, A3, X1, R1 and R2 are each as defined above can be prepared from the corresponding tricyclic cage compound having a suitable substituent by either one of the following methods thereby converting the substituent into an amino group represented byEMI10.1 Aa via ReductionEMI10.2 wherein A12 is a single bond, a C2 C4 alkylene group or a C1 C4 alkylidene group EMI10.3 wherein A12 and R1 are each as defined above and R22 is a hydrogen atom, a C1 C5 alkyl group or a C3 C5 alkenyl group, or when taken together with the adjacent nitrogen atom, R1 and R22 may form a five or six membered heterocyclic group EMI10.4 wherein A1 and R1 are each as defined above and R3 is a C1C4 alkyl group EMI10.5 wherein A1 and R1 are each as defined above and R4 is a hydrogen atom, a C1 C4 alkyl group or a C2 C4 alkenyl group EMI10.6 wherein A12 is as defined above and R5 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 C4 alkyl group EMI11.1 wherein A1 is as defined above EMI11.2 wherein A121 R1, R22 and R5 are each as defined above EMI11.3 wherein R11 is as defined above.
