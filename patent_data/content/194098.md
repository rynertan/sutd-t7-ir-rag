# Treating agent for desulfurizing molten steels and method for treating molten steels.

## Abstract
A treating agent of molten steel according to the present invention is used for desulfurization molten steel for desulfuriz ing it in a reaction vessel 1 which is lined with a basic refracto ry containing MgO, and consists of CaO, CaF₂ and MgO and unavoidable impurities contains from 10 to 60 by weight of MgO, and has a weight ratio of CaF₂ CaO CaF₂ 100 of from 20 to 80 . Said agent is injected with the aid of inert carrier gas into the molten steel bath essentially free of slag 8 . Another treat ing agent essentially consisting of CaO and CaF₂ may be also injected prior and or subsequent to injection of said agent, so as to decrease inclusions. The inert gas may also be injected after injection of said agent s .
