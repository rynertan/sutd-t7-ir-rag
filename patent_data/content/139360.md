# A SOUND ABSORBENT METAL SHEET, A METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTURE AND ACOUSTIC MATERIALS MADE THEREFROM

## Abstract
A thin metal sheet 10 for use in the manufacture of acoustic materials is provided with a multitude of small openings 11 therethrough, said openings being distributed substantially uniformly over the sheet s surface whereby the sheet has an acoustical flow resistance in the range of 10 300 rayls. The sheet can be used for example in the manufacture of acoustic tiles wherein an air chamber 16 is enclosed between the sheet 10 , a base sheet 14 and side walls 12 .
