# Biomedical stimulation lead.

## Abstract
A biomedical stimulation lead wherein the lead body 11 is preformed into a helical configuration to assist in anchoring the lead 10 . The lead includes a non conducting member 31 extending forward of the lead electrode 12 along the axis of the lead body 11 , and tines 19 extending perpendicularly from the member. The tines 19 are flat in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the lead 10 .
