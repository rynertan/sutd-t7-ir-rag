# Audio feedback for remotely controlled manipulators.

## Abstract
The user of a remotely contolled, powered manipulator 4 is provided with audible feedback signals which provide useful information relating to the force and speed of the motor 1, 104 . An audio tone is generated and is frequency mod ulated by a signal which corresponds to motor speed. tone is amplitude modulated by a signal corresponding to motor force thus providing the user with an intutitively inter pretable feedback signal having a speedproportional pitch and force proportional volume. In the case of an electric motor 104 , voltage and current can be monitored to provide speed and force signals respectively. Additional modulation means are disclosed for introducing a force proportional warble component to said tone.
