## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO THE DETECTION OF PARTICLES IN A A GASEOUS MEDIUM The invention relates to the detection of the presence of particles in a gaseous medium such as, for example, spray or mist or particles of smoke. In one specific example, to be described in more detail below, the particles are particles of an oil mist or spray originating, for example, in the atmosphere in the engine room of a ship owing to a leak or fracture in a fuel or lubrication pipe. However, many other applications can be envisaged. According to the invention, there is provided apparatus for detecting particles in a gaseous medium, comprising a device which mechanically oscillates when electrically energised and which changes its frequency of oscillation in response to the deposition of the said particles on a surface of it, whereby detection of its frequency or of its change in frequency enables the presence or absence of the particles to be detected, the said surface being the surface of a coating which is adapted to facilitate the removal of contamination therefrom. Apparatus for detecting oil mist and embodying the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross section through one form of the apparatus Figure 2 is a diagrammatic section on the line II II of Fig.l Figure 3 is a circuit diagram of the apparatus Figure 4 is a diagrammatic cross section through another form of the apparatus and Figure 5 is a diagrammatic cross section through part of an air jet used in the apparatus of Figure 4. As shown in Figure 1, the apparatus comprises a piece of quartz crystal 5 which may, for example, be of the order of 15mm diameter with a thickness of about 2 mm and is mounted between supports 6 and 8 in which it may be held suitably. The structure comprising the crystal and the supports is mounted within a housing 10 defining air passages 12 and 14. At one end, the passages 12 and 14 connect with a converging air inlet 18. At their opposite ends, the cross section of the air passages 12 and 14 is reduced and narrowed down to an air exit 20 which leads into the throat 22 of a venturi tube 24. The latter has an air inlet 26 and an air exit 27. The inlet 26 is connected to a supply of air under pressure via a pipe 28. The support 6 is modified by the provision of an extension 30 defining an air passage 32. The latter terminates in a linearly shaped narrow air exit slot 34. The slot 34 extends substantially across the width W see Figure 2 of the crystal 5. The opposite end of the air passage 32 is led away to the air inlet pipe 28 via an electrically operated valve 35. The surface of the crystal 5 is coated with polytetrafluorethylene P.TFE which may be VYDAX Trade Mark or GP1 Trade Mark . Two electrodes not shown in Figures 1 and 2 are connected to the surface of the crystal 5. The crystal is preferably an AT cut crystal operating in the thickness shear oscillating mode. As shown in Figure 3, the two electrodes 40 and 42 on the crystal 5 are connected to an oscillator circuit 44 whose output frequency is fed into one input of a mixer 46. The other input of the mixer 46 is fed with the output of a reference oscillator 48, and a filter 50 selects the lower of the two sidebands at the output of the mixer. The selected sideband is then fed into a frequency to voltage converter 52 which produces an output voltage dependent on the frequency of the selected sideband. This voltage is fed into a rate circuit 54 which measures the rate of change of the voltage from the unit 52. The rate circuit 54 includes means defining a reference rate of change, and when the actual rate of change of the voltage is in excess of the reference rate of change indicating that the frequency of the oscillator 44 is changing at more than a predetermined rate , an output is produced on a line 56 which activates an alarm unit 58. The output voltage from the converter 52 is also fed into a trigger circuit 60 which is triggered when the actual level of voltage from the converter 52 rises above a predetermined level corresponding to a drop in frequency . When the unit 60 is triggered in this way and after a delay of some minutes, it inhibits operation of the alarm unit 58 and also, by means of a line 62, it opens the electrically operated valve 35 Fig.l . The operation of the apparatus will now be described in more detail. In operation, the crystal 5, supported as shown inFigures 1 and 2 within the housing 10, is mounted within the space to be monitored which may, for example, be adjacent the engine of a ship where the presence of oil mist is to be detected. Air under pressure is then fed from the air inlet pipe 28 into and through the venturi tube 24 and out through the exit 27, thus causing a decrease of pressure at the throat 22. This decrease of pressure causes ambient air from the engine room to be drawn in through the inlet 18 in the directtion of the arrow A. The air flow tends to follow the arrowsA and B and enters the passages 12 and 14 and then out via the exit 20 and the air outlet 27. The apparatus is mounted so that the air drawn in through the passage 18 is representative of the air adjacent the engine if desired, means could be provided for successively sampling the air in different parts of the engine room and feeding the samples in turn into the inlet 18 . Initially, it will be assumed that the atmosphere is free of oil mist or similar pollution. When the circuit Fig.3 is electrically energised, the oscillator A4 is controlled to oscillate at a frequency which is determined by the crystal 5. In one specific example, the nominal frequency may be, say, 1 MHz. The reference oscillator 48 oscillates at a fixed reference frequency differing by, say, 2 EHz from the nominal frequency of the oscillator 33, and therefore the lower sideband output from the filter 50 has a nominal frequency of 2 KHz. The converter 52 therefore feeds a corresponding voltage to the rate detector 54 and the trigger circuit 60. It will now be assumed that owing to a fault in the engine, an oil mist starts to develop and this oil mist is picked up by the air flow flowing into the inlet 18. When this happens, the oil mist particles or droplets are deposited on the surface of the crystal 5 and left there by the air as it then flows on and around the crystal and out through the exit 20. This deposition of oil mist particles on the surface of the crystal 5 represents, of course, additional mass on the crystal and alters its frequency of oscillation. There is thus a resultant change in the output voltage of the converter 52. When the contamination is such that this voltage is changing at more than the predetermined rate established by the reference means within the rate detector 54, the latter produces an output on line 56 which activates the alarm 58. In use, the surface of the crystal 5 may gradually be contaminated with dust and other extraneous particles and this will reduce the efficiency of operation of the apparatus, resulting in a general lowering of sensitivity of the apparatus.When the voltage from converter 52 rises above a predetermined level corresponding to a fall in crystal frequency , the unit 60 is triggered and, after the predetermined delay, opens the valve 35 Fig.l . This causes air under pressure to be fed through the air passage 32 Fig.l on the support 6 and out in the form of an air knife through the slot 34. This longitudinal fan shaped jet of air cleans the contaminating particles off the surface of the crystal 5 and restores its original efficiency. The predetermined delay prevents the air knife from cleaning off oil mist before its effect has been detected by the circuit 54. The PTFE coating is found to help retention of the oil mist particles or droplets on the crystal surface during detection of the change in crystal frequency. If the PTFE coating is omitted, it is found that the droplets tend to spread out to provide a general wetting of the crystal surface, preventing later arriving droplets from being retained. However, although the PTFE helps the droplets to stay on the crystal surface during detection of the change in crystal frequency, it also allows the crystal surface to be much more effectively cleaned by the air jet then would be the case if the coating were omitted. When the unit 60 is triggered, the alarm 58 is inhibited from operation. When the cleaning process has restored the output voltage on the converter 52 to below the predetermined level, the trigger 60 is automatically reset, thus closing the valve 35 Fig.l and restoring the alarm unit 58 to its operative condition. An air flow detector 64 may be positioned within the air inlet 18 Fig.l to produce an electrical output signal on a line 66 in the event of the air flow becoming reduced below a predetermined level owing to failure of the air supply or blockage or similar cause . This electrical signal activates a detector circuit 68 which operates the alarm 58 through anOR gate 70. The flow detector 64 could, for example, be in the form of a thermistor supplied with a current which, in the absence of at least a predetermined air flow across it, is sufficient to heat it to such temperature as produces a measurable change in its resistance and hence a resultant change in output signal. Figure 4 shows a modified form of the apparatus which may be advantageous in certain cases. As shown in Figure 4, this form of the apparatus comprises a piece of quartz crystal 80 which may, for example, be of the order of 15 mm square with a thickness of about 2 mm and is mounted between supports not shown in Fig.4 in which it may be held suitably. The structure comprising the crystal and the supports is mounted within a housing 82 having air inlet and exit passages 84 and 86. At one end, the passage 84 connects with a coverging air inlet 88.The passage 86 is connected to a pump which draws air in through the inlet 88, through the housing 82 and across the surfaces of the crystal, and thence out through the exit 86. The passage 84 has a right angled bend 90 for a purpose to be explained. Two air jets 92 and 94 are mounted to direct air jets to the front and back surfaces of the crystal 80, the jets being directed substantially perpendicular to the crystal surfaces. Fig.5 shows to an enlarged scale one form which each of the jets 92, 94 may advantageously take. Each jet may be fed with air at about 60 pounds per square inch. Each jet is switched on and off by an electrically controlled valve 96, 98. The electrical circuitry of the apparatus shown in Figures 4 and 5 can take the same form as that shown in Figure 3 except that the line 62 would be connected to the valves 96 and 98 . The operation of the apparatus of Figures 4 and 5 is generally the same as that of Figures 1 and 2 and will not be explained in detail. The purpose of the right angled bend 90 is to help prevent large particles from reaching the crystal surface and causing false results. Such large particles strike the surface 90A and are retained there, while the smaller particles continue along the passage 84 to the crystal. The shape and size of the passage 84, and the rate of flow of the air along the passage, are adjusted in accordance with the approximate size of particles to be detected, so as to ensure that excessively large particles are retained on the impact surface 90A. When smaller particles are to be detected, the rate of flow of air through the inlet and exit passages 82, 84 is higher, the throat 100 in front of the crystal is made narrower and crystal is placed nearer the throat. The crystal surfaces both back and front are coated with PTFE and with the same advantages as described above. It is found that the provision of an air cleaning jet acting on the back surface of the crystal, in addition to the air jet acting on the front surface, is advantageous because otherwise the back surface tends to become contaminated. It is not practicable to protect the back surface of the crystal from contamination because any such protection is found to have the effect of preventing free oscillation of the crystal. For both forms of the apparatus, it may be advantageous to arrange for a small amount of a solvent, such as methylene chloride, to be added to the air cleaning jet s . This helps the jets to remove the oil particles. It is found that the rate of change of frequency of the crystal in response to the particles or droplets to be detected, is reduced as the crystal surface becomes more contaminated.It may therefore be advantageous to arrange for the alarm 58 to be activated not merely when the rate detector 54 detects a change in frequency above the predetermined rate but only when this is detected immediately after a cleaning operation has taken place. The circuitry can also be modified so that the rate of operation of the cleaning jet s is itself used as a measure of presence of oil mist instead of the rate of change of crystal frequency. Various modifications of the apparatus may be made.For example, the circuit may be different from that shown inFigure 4 and may not necessarily involve detection of the rate of change of the frequency of oscillation of the crystal 5. If desired, the reference oscillator 48 may be a crystalcontrolled oscillator. The crystal which controls its frequency oscillator may be an enclosed crystal. Instead, it could be mounted so that its oscillation frequency would be affected by general contamination in the atmosphere of the room being monitored by the crystal 5 but so as not to be specifically affected by an oil mist. Therefore, by comparing the frequencies of the two oscillators, the effect of general contamination in the atmosphere could be offset or eliminated. It will be appreciated that the apparatus is by no means limited to use for detecting oil mist but may be used, after suitable modification if necessary, for detecting other particulate substances such as smoke or oil spray for example.
