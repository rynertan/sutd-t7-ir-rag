# DATA HANDLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
In a telecommunications system in which much of the ad dressing information needed for call setting is relatively com plex, a directory storage unit DSU which may be replicated in the interests of system integrity is provided which serves the whole system which may include a number of exchanges E1, E2, ... . When a call which needs such information is to be made, the initial dialling by the calling subscriber sets up a connection 1 to the directory storage unit DSU as a result of which the appropriate addressing information is sent to the caller s terminal. At the caller s terminal it is stored temporari ly, with protocol addition as necessary and the connection to the directory storage unit DSU is broken down. A new and separate connection 2 is now set up to the wanted line under control of the information from the directory storage unit.
