# Apparatus and method for filling a container, especially aseptic filling.

## Abstract
A device for filling containers 11 through a spout 13 on the container includes a sterile chamber 21 that has an opening 27 in a wall 23 through which the spout 13 of the container may be inserted into the chamber. A filling head 71 inside the chamber 21 can connect with the spout 13 and fill the container through the spout. A cup shaped cap 51 inside the chamber 21 can be brought to cover the opening 27 in the wall 23 to substantially prevent the escape of a sterile gas from the chamber 21 when the spout is not in the opening. A fluid spray head 52 inside the cup shaped cap 51 sprays fluid for sterilizing the spout before it is exposed to the sterile chamber, A pair of jaws 31 fit around the spout 13 when the spout is in the opening 27 to substantially prevent the escape of the sterile gas during the filling operation when the container cap 15 is removed.
