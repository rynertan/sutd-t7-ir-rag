## Description
GLAZED STRUCTURAL SYSTEM AND COMPONENTS THEREFOREThis invention relates to improvements in glazed systems for use in industrial, commercial, institutional and residential buildings, and more particularly to improvements in the support structure derived from lengths of metal extrusions of aluminum or alloys thereof, assembled and connected together to provide an open framework for supporting and anchoring glass or other suitable panels or units thereupon to serve as a skylight or as cladding for a building or in solarium or greenhouse construction and in other similar installations.More particularly this invention relates to improvements in those mechanical connections to be established between the principal structural members comprising the framework that will accommodate requisite sealing along the intersections or lines of juncture thereof against penetration of atmosphere or of rainwater or other accumulations upon or draining into such framework,BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONThe introduction and wide acceptance of open concept architecture in recent years has given substantial impetus to the investigation and development of improved glazing systems derived from lengths of interconnected extruded metal members and sheets of glazing that not only will embody aesthetic and environmental considerations but more effectively utilize available natural light and solar energy.Fundamental to the adoption and inclusion of skylights, cladding or other similar systems in building projects is the capability of the selected structure to meet principal objectives apart from those mentioned, such as to effectively limit heat or energy loss, maintenance of the integrity of the enclosed space so as to provide greater control of the interior atmosphere and to ensure stability of the system over a wide range of applied loading and temperatures imposed by the climate and by conditions prevailing within the building,The development of improved systems has given rise to the desire to incorporate a greater expanse of glazed structure into buildings which must accommodate increased accumulations and increased loading and runoff and thereby increase the risk that the joints and other sealed connections of the expanded system will be penetrated by the atmosphere or by waterOBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONThe principal object of this invention therefore is to provide an improved glazing system that can be specified for all manner of installations and particularly where a wide unsupported expanse of same is required to be installed and wherein the likelihood of any penetration of the atmosphere or water through any mechanical joint or seal is minimized thereby preserving both the integrity ofthe system itself as well as the environment within the building over an extended period of time.It is a very important object of this invention to streng then the structure by providing an improved mechanical connection between the components, which can accommodate to a greater degree twisting and deflection, expansion and contraction imparted by changes in external and internal conditions.More particularly it is an object of this invention not only to simplify the manner in which the structural members are joined or connected together which gives rise to an increase in efficiency both in production and assembly but to include therewith more efficient barriers to the atmosphere, water or moisture in the region of the joints or connections.FEATURES OF THE INVENTIONOne principal feature of the invention resides in providing a supporting framework for a glazed systemwherein the elongated structural members thereof include open ended drainage channel formations therein for the collection of water derived from rain, melted snow or condensed moisture and the controlled discharge of same therefrom without appreciable leakage throughout the extent of such framework by arranging that the open ends of the drainage channel formations of the structural members extending in one common direction intersect and overlap the drainage channel formations of the structural members extending in the other common direction whereby not only is the requisite support of the intersecting overlapping structural members achieved but that water collected in the drainage channel formations thereof is discharged therefrom at a point remote fram the intersections with the supporting structural members. More particularly it.is a feature of the invention toprovide a building system wherein the supporting structural member includes a longitudinally extending channel defined by a bottom wall, upstanding spaced apart side walls and a flange formation extending inwardly from at least one of the side walls in overlying spaced relation above the bottom wall and includes a recess within the side wall and associated flange formation which is spaced upwardly from the bottom wall thereof and has a configuration to receive therein one end of the supported structural member in overlapping relation thereto and in full registration with the recess so as to be supported therefrom but above the bottom wall thereof.It is another feature of this invention to provide a novel clip for securing the supported structural member to the supporting structural member which clip is disposed within the channel formation of the supporting structural member and has a configuration so matching the perimeter of the recess therein and the overlapping end of the supported structural member as to embracingly engage same from below the clip extending beyond the recess to engage the flange formation of the supporting structural member from below upon upward displacement thereof into embracing engagement with the overlapping end of the supported structural member, the overlapping end of the supported structural member carrying screw threaded members for engaging and drawing the clip upwardly thereagainst and into engagement with the flange formation of the supporting structural member whereby a secure mechanical connection is achieved.Still another feature resides in providing a resilient bond substantially impervious to the atmosphere and to water between the opposed surfaces of the clip and recess and the overlapping end of the supported structural member when fully registered therewithin and secured against separation so as to minimize if not eliminate any penetration of the atmosphere or water through such connection.More particularly a feature of the invention resides in providing a mechanical connection wherein there is no penetration of the bottom wall of the channel formation of the supporting or supported structural member in a region which would communicate with the interior of the enclosed space, thereby preserving the integrity of the barrier to the outer atmosphere throughout its extent.Still more particularly a feature of this invention resides in providing a clip for the mechanical connection can be appropriately dimensioned to provide a substantial surface of contact with the overlapping end of this supported structural member thereby extending if desired the area for establishing a resilient bond thereto so as to ensure that the barrier to the penetration of either the atmosphere or water is maintained.These and other objects and features are to be found in the following description of the preferred embodiment of the invention to be read in conjunction with the sheets of drawings wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view of a section of an inclined support system for glazing derived from metal components embodying the invention partly broken away and

With this arrangement a substituted barrier to the penetration of the atmosphere water and water vapour between window unit 32 and platform formation 28 is established.Dry seal components 36 are preferably extruded EPDM 60 durometer which key into the aforementioned channel formation presented by aluminum pressure plate 35 at each edge thereof and are held under constant compression of the order of 10 PSI by pressure plate compression screws 30 . Compression screws 30 are preferably self sealing plated steel screws with a selftapping point capped with a suitable plastic. SILL STRUCTURE 14 Still structure 14 illustrated in figures 1, 7 and 8 comprises a base structural support member 40 derived preferably from a suitably formed sheet of aluminum or alloy thereof and includes a base portion 41 and upstanding inclined support portion 42 for supporting and securing extruded aluminum sill member 43 thereto by means of shear transfer bolts 31 but structural support member 40 is separated from extruded sill member 43 by a suitable thermal insulator 44 and shielded by a length of flashing 45 . Extruded aluminum sill member 43 is provided with an upwardly opening U shaped anchoring channel formation 46 along its upper inner edge as depicted in figure 8 and an upstanding bounding wail formation 47 along the lower, outer edge thereof, the latter wall formation 47 presenting a flange or platform formation 48 uppermost suitably serrated longitudinally to provide a gripping surface for a dry seal component 36 of a suitable section of overlying pressure plate 35 to be clamped in position.A second upwardly opening U shaped anchoring channel formation 49 is presented by extruded sill member 43 upstanding from the base portion thereof between innerU shaped anchoring channel 46 and outer upstanding wall formation 47 thereof and including an associated flange or platform formation 50 extending inwardly therefrom upon which an extruded aluminum glass supporting structural member 51 is mounted, which member 51 preferably has a configuration and dimensions in crosssection corresponding to extruded aluminum supporting structural member 24 of head structure 12 . Supporting structural member 51 likewise presents an upwardly opening U shaped anchoring channel. formation 52 along its lower, outer edge and a flange or platform formation 53 along its inner upper edge which flange formation 53 is longitudinally serrated and adapted to support a length of the main seal component 33 upon which the lower edge portion of double glazed window unit 32 bears with the double glazed window unit 32 being clamped against separation under the clamping force applied by the aforementioned length of pressure plates 35 and associated compressible seals, a dry seal component 36 as earlier mentioned and a ramp seal 54 replacing the dry seal component 36 in this embodiment for sealing against the lower edge of window unit 32 .Extruded aluminum supporting structural member 51 is also adapted as illustrated to support the double glazed window unit 32 against downward sliding movement by the provision of an upstanding barrier 55 shown in broken outline which hooks over U shaped channel formation 52 of clamping member 51 and presents a recess formation 56 opening inwardly and upwardly in spaced relation to the lower end of double glazed window unit 32 to receive and retain therebetween a suitable setting block 57 also shown in broken outline which bears against and prevents the lower edge of the double glazed window unit 32 from displacement downwardly.Barrier 55 can be secured in place by suitable assembly screws 58 which are adapted to enter within U shaped anchoring chaNnel 52 all as illustrated in figure 8.Both extruded aluminum supporting structural member 51 and the extruded sill member 43 are provided with drainage openings 59 and 60 thereinto respectively which serve to drain or discharge moisture or water collecting in the interconnected drainage channel system of the inclined framework 16 as will be more particularly described as well as to establish communication between such drainage channel system and the atmosphere so that any pressure buildup from water vapour is avoidedAn appropriate sealant 61a such as liquid butyl is deposited within the confines of flange formation 50 which together with an assembly screw 61b securing supporting structural member 51 to the extruded sill member 43 establishes an inner barrier to the penetration of the atmosphere or of water or water vapour. FRAMEWORK 16 Framework 16 of the inclined glazed system 10 embodying the invention includes rafters 18 which extend upwardly and at a uniform angle between sill structure 14 and head structure 12 .Rafters 18 according to the preferred embodiment illustrated in figures 1 to 4 inclusive are derived from a suitable aluminum extrusion or an alloy thereof and have a tubular configuration or hollow construction as depicted in figures 2, 3, 4 and 6.Alternative rafter configurations are also appropriate, for example the I shape.Rafters 18 preferably have a maximum strength to weight ratio and can be provided over a range of depths as may be required.Rafters 18 of tubular or I shape configuration can be combined if desired in order to meet objectives in any particular setting.Rafters 18 include a pair of spaced apart walls terminated in inwardly extending opposed flange or platform formations 62 and 63 upstanding from the edges of principal wall 64 thereof and overlying same platform formations 62, 63 being longitudinally serrated as at 65 and 66 so as to provide gripping surfaces for retaining longitudinally extending strips of the main seal component 33 against which the respective side edges of the double glazed window units 32 are to be clamped.Upstanding centrally from wall portion 64 between range formations 62 and 63 is.an upwardly opening U shaped anchoring channel formation 67 adapted to receive the threaded shafts 38 of pressure plate compression screws 30 all in a manner as earlier described in connection with the components comprising head structure 12 and sill structure 14 .The configuration of ppposite symmetry of upstanding flange formations 62 and 63 separated by U shaped channel formation 67 define with the wall portion 64 of rafter 18 a pair of open ended drainage channel formations 68 and 69 which extend uninterruptedly throughout the length of rafter 18 from head structure 12 to the sill structure 111 and with openings thereinto extending longitudinally therealong which constitute the main drainage passages.As illustrated in figures 7 and 8 particularly at the intersection of rafter 18 with sill structure 14 , rafter 18 is cut away or recessed as at 70 below. the principal upper wall portion 64 to thereby present to sill structure 111 a projecting portion 72 which is adapted to overlie extruded sill member 43 and terminate inwardly of upstanding wall formation 47 whereby any drainage is discharged below the juncture of rafter 18 with sill member 43 . Extruded aluminum supporting structural members 51 of the sill structure 111 are dimensioned such that they extend between the projecting portions 72 of rafters 18 with the ends of such members 51 abutting the outer surfaces of flange formations 62 and 63 of projecting portions 72 and rafter 18 respectively.Flange formations 53 of extruded supporting structural member 51 are appropriately dimensioned and arranged so as to register with opposed flange formations 62 and 63 of rafter 18 respectively whereby the serrated gripping surfaces thereof for main seal component 33 are disposed in substantially coplanar relation. Likewise in relation to head structure 12 the upper ends of rafters 18 are recessed as at 73 below the principal upper wall portions 64 thereof to provide upper projecting portions 74 which overlap the upper surface of the lower arm portion 22b of main structural support member. 21 and anchored thereto by means of shear transfer bolts 31 . Likewise the ends of supporting structural members 24 of head structure 12 and the outer surfaces of the projecting portions 74 of rafters 18 the dimensioning of the supporting structural members 24 likewise being. selected and the components arranged so that the flange formations 28 thereof register with the opposed platform formations 62 and 63 of rafters 18 . Thus the serrated surface s of the respective flange formations are disposed in substantially coplanar relation for the reception of the lengths of the main seal components 33 to provide a perimetral barrier therearound when a doubl.e glazed window unit 32 is clamped into position there uponIt will be observed from figure 1 that purl.ins 20 of the framework 16 intersect with rafters 18 at intervals. Purlins 20 are likewise preferably derived from an aluminum extrusion or alloy thereof. According to the preferred embodiment as particularly illustrated in figure 5 purlins 20 have a tubular or hollow construction with the principal wall portion 75 thereof presenting spaced apart upwardly extending walls terminating in inwardly extending opposed flange or platform formations 76 and 77 respectively located above wall portion 75 thereby defining at pair of channel .formations as at 73a, 73b . Opposed flange formations 76 and 77 are separated by a centrally located upwardly extending U shaped anchoring channel formation 78 which is adapted to cooperate with the threaded shafts 38 of the pressure plate compression screws 30 all in a manner earlier explained in connection with the head structure 12 and sill struc.ture 14. . Purlins 20 in addition are provided with condensation channel formations 79 and 80 extending outwardly from the opposed wall portions 81 and 82 thereof to trap any moisture condensed on the surfaces of the purlins or on the inner surfaces of the double glazed window units 32 next to the main seal connection established therebetween.According to the invention the ends of purlins 20 are cut away as at 83a and 83b respectively below the principal wall portion 75 thereof and thereby present projection portion 84a and 84b at each end which as illustrated in figure 6 are adapted to overlap the juncture with rafters 18 and discharge any water or condensed water vapour collected therein into drainage channel formations 68 and 69 respectively of the rafter 18 inwardly of the aforementioend intersection.Projection portions 84a and 84b are adapted to register within opposed recesses or openings 85 and 86 respectively formed in opposed wall and flange or platform formations 62, 63 of rafter 18 , which recesses 85 and 86 have a perimeter matching the perimeter of projection portions 84a, 84b of purlins 20 registered therewith.This arrangement ensures that a substantially rigid connection between rafters 18 and purlins 20 in a direction longitudinally of the rafter 18 and preserves the seal to be established therebetween as will be described.Underlying each of projection portions 84a, 84b of purlin 20 and located within each drainage channel formation 68, 69 respectively of rafter 18 are like separable meta novel clips 87 derived from a length of suitable aluminum extrusion or alloy thereof.Clips 87 each include a central platform portion or web 88 as best seen in figures 3 and 4 flanked by a pair of upstanding wall portions 90 and 92 , legs 90 and 92 having an extent such that the central platform formation or web 88 is supported slightly above the main wall portion 64 of rafter 18 and bridge the separation between such main wall portion 64 and the undersurfaces 93, 94 of the respective flange formations 62, 63 of rafter 18 next adjacent recesses 85, 86 .Wall portions 90, 92 terminate uppermost in 96 respectively, which project from wall portions 90, 92 in opposed directions to lie next below undersurfaces 93, 94 of the respective flange formations 62, 63 next adjacent openings 85, 86 .Clips 87 are dimensioned so that the upper surface 89 of central platform formation 88 thereof and the inner surfaces 97a, 97b respectively of wall portions 90, 92 will register with and match the outline or perimeter of the recesses 85, 86 of each of the respective flange formations 62, 63 and form an inward extension thereof thus together with the perimeter of recesses 85, 86 both embracing and supporting the projecting portions 84a, 84b of the intersecting purlins 20 therewithin respectively.Upper surface 89 of central platform formation 88 of clip 87 and the surfaces 97a, 97b of the legs 90, 92 thereof are suitably serrated as illustrated in figure 2 so as to provide an extended gripping surface to a selected sealant such as liquid butyl to bond with and effectively seal the separation between rafters 18 and purlin 20 under clamped engagement therebetween.The particular connection between rafter and purlin so described is adapted to be achieved by means of assemblyscrews 98, 99 which penetrate that portion of the wall 75 of purlin 20 lying within the extent of the projecting portions 84a and 84b thereof beyond the line of juncture or intersection between purlin and rafter. The threaded shafts 100., 101 of assembly screws 98, 99 register within apertures 103,.104 presented by platform formation 88 of clips 87 and draw clips 87 upwardly and force projecting portions 84a, 84b of purlins 20 downwardly to achieve tight clamping engagement between upper surfaces 89 of cen tral platform formations 88 and the lower surfaces of the principal upper wall portion 75 and the surfaces of the side wall portions 81, 82 of the projecting portions 84a, 84b of purlins 20 to which the aforementioned sealant has been adhered. This clamping action exerted by the assembly screws 98, 99 in establishing a connection between purlins 20 and clips 87 urges the wing extensions 95, 96 of clips 87 into engagement with the undersurfaces 93, 94 of the respective flange formations 62, 63 of rafter 18 thereby resiliently anchoring purlins 20 to rafter 18 and notably without the threaded shafts 100 and 101 of assembly screws 98, 99 penetrating the principal upper wall portion 64 of rafter 18 .Accordingly in so far as framework 16 is concerned there is no breach by an assembly screw or other fastener of any principal wall portion 64 of rafter 18 which serves as the bottom wall for drainage channels 68, 69 or any principal wall portion 75 of purlin 20 which serves as the bottom wall for drainage channels 73a, 73b in any region except where the projecting portions 72 and 74 of the rafter 18 overlap the supporting structural support member of the head structure 12 or sill structure 14 or except where the projecting portions 811a, 84b of the purlins 26 overlap the drainage channel formations 68, 69 of rafters 18 .Thus the integrity of the metal barrier constituted by structural members is preserved.One of the clips 87 illustrated in figure 2 of the drawings is shown in place immediately prior to being clamped by assembly screws 98, 99 to purlin projecting portion 84a . The relationship established between inserted clip 87 and upstanding flange formation 62 with clip 87 in place is illustrated by figure 4 of the drawings.The other clip 87 illustrated in figure 2 which is likewise adapted to secure and anchor purlin projecting portion 84b to arrow 102 indicating the direction of inserting such clip 87 within such opening 86 and below the adjacent ends of flange formation 63 presented to recess 86 .More particularly in figure 3 the manner of inserting clip 87 within the drainage channel formations of the rafter 18 to register with the openings 85, 86 is shown in stages by means of solid and broken outline whereby clip 87 is ultimately seated in full registration with the opening 86 . The preferred sealant l iquid butyl which is applted and spread over the upper serrated surfaces 89 of central platform formation 88 and surfaces 96, 97 of wall portions 91, 92 of clips 87 as well as over the edges of the respective recesses 85, 86 in rafter 18 and over the mating surfaces of the projecting portions 84a, 84b of purlins 20 is cured filling up any separation therebetween and establishing a strong resilient bond between opposed surfaces thereby ensuring that a substantially permanent barrier will persist minimizing if not eliminating penetration of atmosphere water or water vapour from the drainage channels 68, 69 of the rafters 18 to the space enclosed by the glazed system.It will be understood that this resilient connection derived by clamping purlins 20 to rafters 18 in the manner outlined creates a resilient bonding along with a mechanical connection that is derived from clamping engagement as opposed to direct attachment of purlin to rafter by a bracket and threaded fasteners. This connection or joint will withstand the loading generated by the expansion and contraction of the components over a wide range of temperatures and deformation to which the structure is subjected by climate, interior heating and forces generated by the wind or by rainwater or under accumulations of snow or ice.It is also to be observed that purlins 20 of framework 16 are appropriately dimensioned so as to present to flange formations 62, 63 of rafters 18 the opposed purlin flange formations 76, 77 as particularly illustrated in figures 5 and 6 thus establishing the substantially coplanar relationship to support the lengths of the main seal component 33 which underlie the edgesof the double glazed window units 32 and provide a continuous main peripheral seal 33 peripherally below such window units.More particularly, it is to be observed that the opposed purlin flange formations 76, 77 together with purlin upper wall 75 and centrally located and upstanding U shaped anchoring channel 78 define a pair of drainage channels 73a and 7liy for collecting and discharging rainwater or condensed water vapour to the drainage channel formations 68 and 69 of rafters 18 .Figure 6 of the drawings shows that the open ends of purlin projecting portions 84a, 84b are spaced from the central upstanding U shaped anchoring channel formation 67 of rafter 18 so that drainage from channel formations 73a ,and 711a is unobstructed for the ready discharge of accumulated runoff or condensed vapour.System 10 established by the intersecting interconnected rafters 18 and purlins 20 appropriately anchored and completed by head structure 12 and the sill structure 14 as outlined provide the requisite uninterrupted perimetral support for double glazed window units 32 clamped in place sealed outermost under the clamping pressure exerted by pressure plates 35 and pressure plate compression screws 30 and associated dry seals 33 and ramp seals 54 against the outer surface of window units 32 constituting a first barrier to the penetration of the atmosphere or rainwater.Each such clamped window unit 32 supported upon framework 16 is bounded by an interior peripheral drainage channel formation comprised of drainage channels 68 or 69 of rafters 18 or drainage channels 73a and 74a of purlins 20 and lowermost by the channels 105 defined within extruded supporting structural members 51 of sill structure 14 .Any rainwater or melted snow or ice penetrating the seals of pressure plates 35 or water vapour condensing within the interior drainage channels will be directed to the sill structure and ultimately discharged to the atmosphere through drainage openings 59 and 60 . It is essential in the mounting of the double glazed window units 32 within the supporting framework 16 that appropriate double glazing supports in the form of an upstanding barrier 55 and setting blocks 57 be installed where necessary as shown in broken outline in figure 5, which arrangement corresponds to that employed in the sill structure , 14 . Further it is to be understood that.in the case of the seals associated with the pressure plate sections 35 which are to be secured to purlins 20 the upper seals are preferably ramp seals as indicated at 106 in figure 5. The ramp seal 106 of figure 5 and ramp seal 54 of figure 8 provide a greater surface of gripping contact and thereby tend to preserve the integrity of the connection as well as better deflect any descending rainwater or accumulations of snow or ce lodged on the exterior surface.It will be understood that the intersecting pressure plates 35 are suitably cut and placed to overlie and isolate from the exterior the entire interior drainage channel system by means of associated seals 33 and ramp seals 54 and 106 and are to be maintained under a clamping pressure of the order of 10 PSI against the perimeters of the double glazed window units 32 to preserve the connection. With such an arrangement the major proportion of the components of the metal framework 16 , the head structure 12 and the sill structure 14 are likewise isolated from the exterior atmosphere with the practical result that a maximum metal surface is exposed two the temperature of the interior with the minimum metal surface exposed to the exterior. Thus such an arrangement minimizes heat transfer to and from the interior or enclosed space and brings the control of the interior atmosphere within better defined limits. The second barrier to penetration is constituted by the interior drainage channel system which include the downsloped overlapping projection portions of the respective purlin and rafters all exteriorally located of the main seal components 33 and therebetween thereby minimizing the likelihood of penetration of the atmosphere or water into the enclosed interior space and thereby preserving its i ntegrity.Finally by reason of the novel clamping interlock between rafter 18 and purlins 20 by means of the clip 87 and associated assembly screws and the resilient bond established therebetween by the confined sealant a flexible connection or joint capable of accomodating loading due to expansion and contraction over a wide range of temperatures and applied forces is achieved while any penetration therebetween is blocked.It will be understood that this invention gives rise to the ready provision of a much greater expanse of substantially impenetrable glazed structure than heretofore contemplated and thereby extends the boundaries of open concept architecture.The framework 16 can be supported along the sides thereof between the head structure 12 and sill structure 14 by a variety of structural alternatives derived from formed aluminum sheeting anchored to suitable supporting members or walls in a manner similar to that illustrated in connection with the head structure or to adjacent like glazed frameworks as for example angled to one another in multifaceted skylight construction. Modified shapes or configurations of rafters 18 and purlins 20 may be substituted for these illustrated to provide a dome like or barrel vault structure according to specification. Single glazing or triple glazing may be substituted for double glazing.It will be understood therefore that it is intended that changes can be made in the preferred embodiment described and illustrated herein by those persons skilled in this field without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims,
