# One step curing method for manufacture of neutron absorbing articles.

## Abstract
A one step curing method for the manufacture of neutron absorbing articles, such as plates for use in storage racks for spent nuclear fuel, includes curing a mixture of boron carbide particles, phenolic resin in liquid state and phenolic resin in particulate solid form at an elevated temperature to produce a neutron absorbing article containing at least 6 of B¹⁰ content from the boron carbide thereof, 60 to 80 of boron carbide particles and 40 to 60 of irreversibly cured phenolic polymer, with the proportion of weight phenolic resin in liquid state to that of phenolic resin in solid state being within the range of about 1 0.5 to 1 4, the temperature of the cure being in the range of about 130 to 200 C. and the cure being effected over a period of about two to twenty hours. Although the liquid resins that are preferably employed are resols, novolaks plus curing agents are preferred solid resins.
