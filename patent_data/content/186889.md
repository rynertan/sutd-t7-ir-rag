# A semiconductor memory array having a plurality of associated drive transistors.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device includes a memory cell array comprised of a plurality of memory cells each having a single transfer transistor 28A to 30A and a single capacitor 22, 23, 36 and a peripheral circuit including a plurality of drive transistors 28A to 30B, 33 and adapted to drive the memory cell. The source and drain regions 30A of the transfer transis tor have an impurity concentration lower in level than that of the source and drain regions 33 of the drive transistor.
