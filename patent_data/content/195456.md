# METHOD OF SURFACING THE HEATER OF A FURNACE FOR OPTICAL FIBRE DRAWING

## Abstract
The method of surfacing the heater of a furnace for optical fibre drawing allows elimination of defects in the inner heater surface, which defects give rise to particle emission towards the preform. This is achieved by deposit ing a thin layer of a mixture of oxides compatible with the material composing the heater.
