# Method for forming micropattern.

## Abstract
A method for forming a micropattern, comprises the steps of forming an organic polymeric material layer 2 on a substrate 1 , forming a silicone layer 3 on the organic polymeric material layer 2 , selectively irradiating a surface of the silicone layer 3 with a high energy beam 4 , exposing the surface of the silicone layer to a radical addition polymerizable monomer gas 5 so as to form a graft polymer film 6 on an irradiated portion of the surface of the silicone layer 3 , performing reactive ion etching using the graft polymer film 6 as a mask so as to form a silicone pattern, and performing reactive ion etching using the silicone pattern as a mask so as to form an organic polymeric material pattern. The method allows formation of a resist pattern with a high precision and a high aspect ratio.
