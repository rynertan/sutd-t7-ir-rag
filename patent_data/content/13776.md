# Combi stroke and combi shaft combustion engine.

## Abstract
1. An internal combustion engine nameable combi stroke engine in which the crank shafts have such a posi tion with regard to each other that the smallest volume of the combustion chamber is attained when the pistons con nected to one crank shaft have passed the highest dead point in order to get a higher output or power. 2. An internal combustion engine nameable combi shaft engine. In such an engine the linear motion of a pi ston is transformed in rotation by means of a crank shaft combination. In this combination one or more crank shafts can be considered as crank or cranks for a secondary crank shaft in order to get a higher output and torque. 3. An internal combustion engine can be composed by using the abstract 1 and abstract 2 in one engine. 4. Transformation of rectilinear motion into rotation by means of combi shaft can also be used in other con struction than internal combustion engines.

## Description
Combi stroke and combi shaft combustion engineThe invention relates to two kinds of combustion engines, nameable combi stroke and combi shaft engine in a combi stroke engine, the smallest volume of the combustion chamber between the pistons is attained, when fast or slow moving piston or pistons has or have past the highest dead point in a combi shaft engine the piston motion is transformed into rotation by means of a crankshaft combination.Almost all reciprocating engines with internal combustion are based on the two stroke, four stroke or Wankel principle. A new principle nameable combi stroke has been put forward in the Dutch patent application nr. 7807179.The inventions as claimed are intended to create internal combustion engines with considerable higher output.Theoretical a higher output in piston engines can be got when 1. the pressure on the pistons stayes on a higher level during whole or a part of the active stroke 2. pressure and temperature are on a lower level at the end of the active stroke 3. the obtained turning effect on the crank shaft is larger especially at the start of the active stroke.Those conditions can be fulfilled in combi stroke engines of which the graphical rendering is shown in the figures 1 and 2. They distinguish themselves of combi stroke engines as described in theDutch application nr. 7807179 by the position of the crank shafts, which is changed in this way, that the smallest volume of the combustion chamber is attained, after the slow moving piston s has have past the highest dead point.The conditions can also be fulfilled by means of a new construction in four stroke engines, nameable combi shaft, or in full combinated crank shaft. In such an engine the motion of every piston is transformed into rotation by means of a composed crank shaft, in which one or more crank shafts can be considered as crank or cranks for a secondary crank shaft.Fig.3 shows such a combi shaft in outline AB is the crank of the primary crank shaft, rotating around point B BC is the crank of the secondary crank shaft, rotating in the same time and direction as AB around point C. A piston with connecting rod to point A will make four strokes during one rotation of BC.Fig. 4 gives a graphical representation of the piston motion, brought about by every part of the crank shaft and in full line the addition of the two, which represents the total piston travel.Considering the figures, it is obvious that the almost smallest volume of the combustion chamber in both types of engines changes less than in normal four stroke engines during some time and that the expansion proportion is biggerEMI2.1 the compression proportion.A further analysis of the combi stroke cycle shows remarkable differencies to a normal four stroke process. In fits. 5, the pressure courses during compression and expansion in a combi stroke and a four stroke process have been drawn in outline. They show that the duration of compression and expansion are considerable longer in the combi stroke process. The compression starts earlier through which the pressure in the ignitionmoment of a combi stroke petrol engine is higher. During whole the expansion in a 2 4 combistroke engine, the slow moving crank shaft turnes 450 just inside the area in which the largest turning effect is brought about.The fast moving crank shaft meets with a turning effect analogous to a normal four stroke engine. Owing to this, the total torque in a combi stroke engine, theoretical can be about 25 higher as in four stroke engines, in case of low number of revolutions.The difference. decreases to about 10 in case of high number of revolutions.The total increase of output as result of bigger torque and larger expansion could be, theoretical, up to 100 in comparison with usual four stroke engines.Other crank shafts can be constructed e.g. to be employed in twostroke engines se fig. 6 or in order to get rectilinear motion of a connecting rod see fig. 7 .Other possibilities, related to these inventions are application of combi stroke and combi shaft together in one engine and combishaft, used in other constructions where linear motion must be transformed into rotation.In combi stroke engines a larger torque can also be formed, when the fast moving piston or pistons reach es earlier the highest dead pointEMI3.1 the slow moving piston or pistons.The ways to carry out the invention concerning combi stroke are the same as in the Dutch application 7807179 only the position of the crank shafts is different.One way of carrying out the invention concerning combi shaft is drawn in fig. 8, showing a perspective view of a combi shaft fig. 8a is a side view in cross section and fig 8b is a front view of the connection between primary and secondary crank shaft by means of toothed wheels. The connection in order to get the wished rotation of primary and secondary crank shaft in the same time and direction, containes a inside toothed wheel 1 attached to the engine s body a toothed wheel 5 is attached to the primary crank shaft 4 a intermediary toothed wheel 3 turnes on the shaft 2, sticking out from the segment 6 of the secondary crank shaft toothed wheel 3 seizes in the toothed wheels 1 and 5.In fig. 8a, AB and BC are corresponding to AB and BC in fig. 3.In fig. 9 any conbistroke engine has been drawn in outline 1 is the inlet under pressure e.g. by a turbine 2 fuel injection 3 inlet valve 4 sparkle 5 exhaust holes, circularly in the cylinder wall 6 two stroke crank shaft 7 four stroke crank shaft 8 connecting toothed wheel 9 shaft.
