# Bird decoy.

## Abstract
A bird decoy has an elongate chassis 11 with a spike 15 on which the body of a dead bird can be impaled. Side members 12 hold the dead body in position laterally. Arms 16, 17 mounted pivotally in the nose 27 of the chassis carry crocodile clips 18, 19 at their respective ends and are spring loaded back towards the chassis. In use, the clips 18, 19 grip the wing tips of the dead bird the arms 16, 17 are actuated by pulling one end of a line not illustrated the other end of which is attached via a linking cord 22 to each arm and the resultant pivotal movement of the arms, and wings, away from and back towards the chassis simulates the wing flapping movements of a live bird.

Preferably also the clips are of the kind which grip the adjacent wing positively to hold the wing fast to the arm. As the dead bird stiffens, clips cf this kind may become essential for the wing flapping movement to be effective. They may for example be spring loaded clips of the kind popularly referred to as crocodile clips.It is, however, within the scope of the invention for the clips to allow the wing to slide through them whilst nevertheless constraining it to move with the arm away from and back towards the body of the dead bird.The chassis may carry a spike, on which the body of the dead bird can be impaled, and may also have side members to hold the body in place on the chassis when so impaled. The spike provides a positive location of the body longitudinally on the chassis, and the side members locate the body crosswise of the chassis, without the need for straps or clips which by comparison are troublesome to operate and which would also detract from the realism of the decoy.The movement of the arms away from and back towards the chassis may be a pivotal movement. This can readily be arranged without the need for complicated articulated or sliding linkages. Alternatively or additionally the arms may slide relative to the chassis. The arms may for example telescope to give the required movement, and enable the decoy to accommodate a wide range of wing spans.A decoy embodying the invention may be supplied with a pest. one end cf which can be impaled into the nc sc as to project therefrom whilst the other end to and carries the chassis. Alternatively or add itionall the said one end of the post may fit and be supported by a peg which can itself be impaled into the ground before receiving the post. In the latter arrangement, the peg can positively be rammed down into the ground by the user s foot, and the post fitted into it, and there is then minimal risk of the post working its way out of the ground if the peg has first been fully driven home.The chassis, or the post, may carry or define a ring through which the line attached to the linkage passes on its way from the linkage to the user.Where the arms are pivotally mounted on the chassis, one respective half of each of the necessary pivot bearings may be formed in one of two portions of the chassis, each of which portion fits onto the other to complete the pivot bearings when the chassis is first being assembled. This enables the pivoting ars themselves to be accurately prefabricated, on special jigs if necessary, rather than having to be inserted as straight arms into an already complete pivot bearing and then bent to shape in the bearing with consequent risk of damage to the bearing as well as inaccurate fabrication of the arms. One bird decoy embodying the invention is shown, by way of example only, in the accompanying drawings.It will now be described with reference to those H, ra ings. Brief Description of the DrawingsFigure 1 shows the chassis and associated parts viewed in perspective from above Figure 2 shows the same parts viewed in perspective from below Figure 9, a ain in perspective, shows detaiis of the assembly of part of the chassis Figures as, w and AC show details of the post and peg which complete the assembly andFigure 5 shows a modified version of the chassis.Description of the Preferred Embodiments Referring initially to Figures 1 and 2., an elongate chassis referenced 11 has two semi circular hoops 12, 13 spaced along its length and also has a squaresection projection 14 extending a short way from the chassis. The two hoops 12, 13 both project from the tcp side of the chassis, whilst the projection 14 extends from the underside of the chassis.An elongate spike 15 also projects from the top side of the chassis. The spike 15, the projection 14, and 5 hoops 12. 13 are all cast integrally with the chassis ion rnay be of metal or synthetic plastics construction. The spike and hoops are so positioned, relative to one another, that if the body of a dead pigeon is impaled on the spike then the hoops 12, 13 support the body crosswise of the chassis 11. The hoops thus constitute side members of the chassis 11.Two elongate arms respectively 16, 17 project each from a respective opposite side of the chassis 11.Each arm carries at its projecting end a respective clip referenced, respectively, 18, 19. Each clip is a spring loaded clip of the kind knon popularly as a crocodile clip, i.e. the clip has elongate serrated jaws as illustrated and the serrations mate with one another when the jaws come together to give a positive grip. under very strong torsion spring loading halfway al ng t1 e wing lending edge. The inr r end of each arm 16, 17 is pivotally attached to the nose 21 f the chassis 11 in front of the spike 15. The formation of the pivot bearings will be described in detail later, but it will be seen fromFigures 1 and 2 that the inner ends of the arms 16,17 emerging from the bearings in the nose 21 of the chassis are joined by a relatively short length of cord 22. The cord 22 constitutes a linkage between the arms 16, 17. b web of material 23 cast integrally with the spike 15 and the adjacent nose portion of the chassis 11, has a hole 23 formed in it. A length of elastic cord 24 passes through the hole 23 as it joins one arm 16 to the other arm 17. If the linkage cord 22 is pulled, the arms 16, 17 will pivot away from one another and hence away from the chassis 11 against the spring action of the elastic cord 24. When the linkage cord 22 is subsequently released, the spring action of the elastic cord 24 will automatically pull the arms 16, 17 back towards one another and hence back into the chassis sides .Referring now to Figure 3, it will be seen that the nose region of chassis 11 is initially in two parts.That part which is cast, moulded or machined integrally with the rest of the chassis 11 has a dovetailed recess 25 formed in it. The recess 25 opens onto the top surface of the chassis, in front of the spike 15, hut it does not open onto the bottom surface of the chassis As Figure 3 shows, the base 26 of the recess 25 occurs approximately halfway down the distance between the top and bottom chassis surfaces.An initially separately formed nose portion 27 has a dovetail 28 extending from it. The dovetail 28, again, does not extend the full depth of the portion 27, but stop. approximately halfway down it. The dovetail 28 is so sized as to fit tightly into the dovetailed recess 25, and the nose portion 27 can thus be fitted onto the front of the chassis 11 by, for example, drcpplng a spot of adhesive into the recess 25 and then pushing the dovetail ed nose portion 27 home.As Figure 3 also shows, respective halves of each of the pivot bearings for the arms 16, 17 are formed in the portion 27 and the dovetail recessed front portion of the chassis 11. When the portion 27 is pushed home, the pivot bearing halves align with one another.This construction makes it possible for the arms 16, 17 which are forned with elongate resilient metal wire, to be bent to shape on a separate jig rather than having to be first passed as straight wires through non split bores in a fully integrally nosed chassis and then bent to shape once they are in the chassis.The geometry of the arms 16, 17 is extremely important if the arm linkage is to work pr operly in pivot ing the arms away from and back towards the chassis.The construction illustrated in Figure 3 is therefore a major innovation.A square section aluminium post 29 ends in an enlarged head 31 which is also of square section and is hollow.The projection 14 fits into the head 31. The end of the post 29 remote from the head 31 also fits into a square section bore in the top of a peg 32. Figure R shows the post and peg, and the way they fit into the projection 1LI whilst Figure LIB shows successive sections A A and B B through the peg body.In use, and with the body of a dead pigeon carried by the chassis as outlined previously, the projection 14 is fitted intn thp head 31. The peg 32 is impaled int tEle rnu 4. dri. n home for example by foot pressure and the end f the post 29 rote from the head 31 is fitted into it. The chassis, with the bird, is thus supported some way above the ground.A length of line not shown is fastened to the midpoint of the linkage cord 22 and is led through a D ring 33 pivotally carried by the post 29. Having passed through this ring, the cord is led away to the user who conceals himself from view.By intermittently pulling and releasing the cord, the user operates the linkage cord 22 and flaps the wings of the dead pigeon. The ring 33 enables the user to position himself at any point around the decoy and a pull on the line will have the same result irrespective of such positioning. For example, the user could even position himself in front of the decoy i.e. facing, although of course some considerable distance from, the nose of the chassis and the cord pull would till work. n Figure 5, the chassis nose does not have a separate front portion dovetailed into it as previously des cribed and illustrated. Instead, the bores which constitute the pivot bearings are open along the front of the nose. The open channels in each bore occupy considerably less than a semi circle of the bore section, and the chassis nose is made of a resilient plastics material. These two features enable the arms 16, 17 to be snap fitted into the bores. As with the previous construction, the arms 16, 17 can be accurately fabricated to shape on separate jigs before being snapped into the bores in Figure 5.In another modification, not illustrated, the previously described dovetail nose fitment is used but the dovetail tapers towards its base. The main chassis recess which accepts the dovetail is similarly and co operatingly tapered, and n that case there is then no need for a positive base to the dovetail or to the recess. The nose will autonatically fit fully home when the taper prevents it from being pushed any father downwards into its accommodating recess.
