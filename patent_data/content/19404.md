# Process for producing a blending vinyl chloride resin, paste dispersion comprising such blending vinyl chloride resin, and molded articles prepared from such paste dispersion.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the preparation of a blending vinyl chloride resin suitable for use in conjunction with a paste vinyl chloride resin in providing paste dispersions which can give molded articles of high quality. The blending vinyl chloride resin is prepared by a suspension polymerization process in which a water soluble protein is used as a suspending agent, and in which a proteolytic enzyme is used to treat the resulting polymer. The use of the water soluble protein provides spherical polymer particles having a particle size particle size particularly suitable for blending purposes, while the treatment with the proteolytic enzyme removes a surface skin of protein on polymer particles which might otherwise reduce the affinity of the blending polymer particles for the paste resin.
