# Picture display device.

## Abstract
Errors occurring in the beam current measurement in a video output stage can be reduced by increasing the recharging rate of the capacitive load of a video amplifier, constituted by the picture display tube of a picture display arrangement, with the aid of a bias current 33 or a quiescent current 47, 48 which is subtracted again 35 from the current applied to an input 31 of the beam current measuring circuit 9 which is controlled by the video amplifier.
