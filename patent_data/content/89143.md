## Abstract
A novel technetium 99m complex with thiodiglycollic acid, of unknown structure, has renal clearance properties in rats similar to Hippuran I 131, and is useful as a gamma camera renography agent. When an aqueous solution of pertechnetate TcOâ‚„ is reduced with tin metal or Sn in the presence of thiodiglycollic acid, there results a mixture of two complexes, designated 1 and 2, which can be separated by high performance liquid chromatography. Complex 1 can be converted by heating the mixture into the desired complex 2 which has superior renal clearance.

## Description
DIAGNOSIS OF KIDNEY FUNCTION The well established nuclear medicine diagnostic technique of renography gives a dynamic representation of the removal of substances from the blood by the kidneys, and their excretion into the urine. A radioactive material which is rapidly excreted from the kidneys is injected into the patient, and its passage through the kidneys is observed with detectors placed over the kidneys probe renography . The current material of choice for this purpose is sodium iodohippurate Hippuran 1 131. Instead of using a single detector over each kidney, it is possible to use a gamma camera. Not only is this much more convenient, especially with children, since accurate positioning is no longer essential, but the results can be stored on tape and the tape repiayed in such a way as to accept only the signals from a selected area of the kidney. For this and other reasons, the technique of gamma camera renography is potentially a very powerful one. Development of the technique has however been held up by the difficulty of finding a suitable radioactive material for injection into the patient. A gamma camera renogram requires much larger quantities of activity than does a simple probe renogram, and, with iodine 131, the radiation dose to the patient especially one with impaired renal function would be quite unacceptable. For many years, therefore, workers in the field have attempted to find a suitable Tc 99m complex which could be used in place of Hippuran I 131. This invention results from the discovery of such a substance. The kidney contains about 1 million nephrons, each comprising a glomerulus and a tubule. The glomerulus acts as a molecular filter, by allowing water from the blood to pass through this is the source of the urine together with all small molecules it will not allow the passage of large protein molecules such as albumin.The tubules re absorb most of the water from the filtrate back into the blood, and re absorb essential small molecules such as glucose they also allow other small molecules to pass from the blood to the urine tubular secretion . Of the blood flowing through the kidney, about 20 of the water present passes through the glomerular filter. Thus, if a substance is removed from the blood only by glomerular filtration, only 20 of it will be removed from the blood in a single pass through the kidney. However, if it is removed effectively also by tubular secretion, up to 100 of it may be removed from the blood in a single pass. To obtain a renogram with good diagnostic properties, as much as possible of the radioactive substance should be removed in a single pass. About 80 of Hippuran is removed in a single pass. Other substances are known which are removed as efficiently as Hippuran, but like Hippuran they cannot be labelled with technetium 99m. An example of substances which are removed from the blood by glomerular filtration only are metal complexes of diethylene triamine pentacetic acid DTPA .DTPA is easily labelled with technetium 99m, and the labelled product has been used for gamma camera renograms. But DTPA Tc 99m, shows a clearance rate only about 20 of that of Hippuran I 131, and as a result, renograms obtained with DTPA Tc 99m are flat and of limited diagnostic value. A large number of substances are known which are removed from the blood by glomerular filtration only, and many of these could be labelled with technetium 99m but renograms obtained using these substances would suffer from the same disadvantages as those obtained from DTPA. Three necessary features for a gamma camera renography agent are a it must be capable of being removed from the blood by tubular secretion as well as by glomerular filtration in the kidney b it must not accumulate significantly in the kidney or any other organ and c it must be capable of being labelled with technetium 99m. Thiodiglycollic acid TDG has the formula HOOC CH2 S CH2 COOH The complex of TDG with technetium 99m TDG Tc 99m has been described by Inoue 0, Ikeda I and Kurata K inRadioisotopes 1976, 25, 24 30. The authors were looking for agents for renal scanning, that is to say, for static agents which would give a high kidney to background emission ratio. For this purpose, they required agents which would become localised in the kidney. Although there is some confusion between TDG and DTG dithiodiglycollic acid in the article, their conclusions were that TDG Tc 99m was excreted rapidly outside the kidney and appeared to behave similarly to DTPA Tc 99m and was therefore unsuitable for their purpose. The use of TDG Tc 99m for renography forms the subject of our British Patent Application 8112866 filed only 27th April 1981. TDG Tc 99m is removed from the blood by tubular secretion as well as by glomerular filtration in the kidneys but the clearance rate is not as high as that of Hippuran I 131. The present invention results from our discovery that preparation of TDG Tc 99m can result in a mixture of two complexes of which one shows a higher renal clearance rate than the other. We describe preparation of a mixture of the two complexes and recovery of the separated complexes from the mixture.We describe how one complex may be converted into the other. We give some comparative animal data for the two complexes. In one aspect the present invention provides a technetium 99m containing material useful as a gamma camera renography agent and characterized by the following properties a reduction of an aqueous solution of pertechnetate TcO4 with a tin reducing agent in the presence of thiodiglycollic acid gives rise to a mixture of two complexes of technetium 99m with thiodiglycollic acid designated 1 and 2, of which complex 2 is the claimed technetium 99m containing material b when the mixture from a is subjected to high performance liquid chromatography using a 250 x 4.6 mm stainless steel column containing a packing material composed of spherical silica particles with a mean diameter of 5 microns carrying bonded aminopropyl residues, using an aqueous solution of thiodiglycollic acid 0.06M, pH 4.0 as eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min, such that the retention times of pertechnetate and complex 1 are about 5 minutes and 10 minutes respectively, the retention time of complex 2 is approximately 12.5 minutes c when the mixture from a is heated, complex 1 is converted into complex 2 and d when injected into rats, complex 2 shows renal clearance properties similar to Hippuran I 131. In this statement of invention and in claim 1 we define the material complex 2 by reference to a method for its preparation. But the invention encompasses the new material per se, irrespective of how it may have been made. If the material is made by reduction of pertechnetate, the choice of reducing agents is not confined to tin reducing agents stannous tin and tin metal , and other reducing agents may in principle be employed and may be effective to form the claimed material. As described in our British Patent Application 8112866, TDG Tc 99m the mixture may be prepared by two methods a To a mixture containing Sn , and TDG is added an aqueous solution of pertechnetate To04 . Improved and more reliable results may be obtained by performing method a in the presence of cuprous ion and or nitrate ion. b To a mixture containing tin metal, Cu andTDG is added an aqueous solution of pertechnetate Tc04 When the product of method a or method b is subjected to purification by means of high peformance liquid chromatography HPLC under suitable conditions, two radioactive components are recovered, herein designated 1 and 2. Typical ratios of 1 2 are 2.0 4.0 1. As indicated below, complex 2 has more advantageous properties for renography than complex 1. It may be possible to adjust the conditions of preparation so as to obtain a higher yield of complex 2. At ambient temperature complex 2 appears stable over several hours, while complex 1 very slowly breaks down to form largely 2 and Tc colloid. In one case, on standing overnight, the ratio of 1 2 decreased from 3 1 to 1 1. The rate of conversion of 1 to 2 is temperature dependent, being decreased at low 20C temperatures, and increased at temperatures above ambient. Complex 2 may be obtained from the mixture in yields greater than 90 by heating at 80 C for 40 minutes, or 1000C for 15 minutes, or 1200C for 5 minutes. Heating the mixture undr sterilizing conditions e.g. 5 minutes at 1200C provides a convenient way of effecting the desired conversion. Thus, time and temperature of heating may be chosen havina regard to the 6 hour half life of Tc 99m to obtain complex 2 in desired yield and purity. The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 Separation of Complexes 1 and 2 The two Tc complexes of TDG may be separated by anion exchange HPLC. Two examples of this technique are outlined, below i The aqueous solution of TDG Tc 99m resulting from preparation b above is subjected to HPLC using a 250 x 4.6mm stainless steel column, containing a packing material composed of spherical silica particles with a mean surface area of 200m2 g, carrying bonded aminopropyl residues, with an aqueous solution of TDG 0.06M, pH 4.0 as eluent, at a flow rate of 1 ml min.With this system two Tc complexes of TDG are observed denoted 1 and 2 , with the retention times of 10 and 12.5 mins, respectively. Tc04 has a retention time of 5 minutes. Typical ratios of 1 2 are 2.0 to 4.0 1.ii In a procedure similar to above in which the packing material was composed of irregular shaped silica particles with mean surface area 400m2 g carrying quaternary ammonium residues, and the eluent was 25mM aqueous sodium sulphate, retention times for the two complexes were 6.6 1 and 8.4 2 minutes. Both methods allow physical separation of the two complexes. HPLC analysis of the separated complexes has demonstrated that both may be obtained with radiochemical purities in excess of 90 . Example 2 Animal Studies Solutions of complexes 1 and 2 from Example 1 were injected into rats and the biodistribution pattern noted. The results of these experiments in rats are summarised in Table 1 below, comparing the data on 1 and 2 with earlier data on TDG Tc 99m, Hippuran 1 131 and DTPA Tc 99m under identical conditions. In all cases, data from animal experiments was used only when the renal performance appeared normal , i.e. no unilateral or bilateral renal retention. Data was also rejected in cases of significant retention of activity at the injection site.EMI7.1 tb SEP Table SEP 1 tb SEP Time SEP DTPA SEP Complex SEP Complex SEP Hippuran SEP TDG tb SEP min SEP Tc 99m SEP 1 SEP 2 SEP 1 131 SEP Tc 99m tb SEP e tb SEP in SEP 5 SEP 12.0 SEP 24.9 SEP 33.4 tb bladder SEP 10 SEP 33.3 SEP 29.9 SEP 43.6 SEP 53.8 SEP 44.1 tb of SEP that SEP 15 SEP 45.9 SEP 66.8 SEP 63.9 tb at SEP 2 SEP hrs.
