# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING A STILL REPRODUCTION OF A VIDEO TAPE RECORDER

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for reproducing a still picture without a noise bar from a magnetic tape in a video tape recoder. The magnetic tape is stopped in a moment at a leading edge of a rotating phase detecting signal of rotating heads or a reproduced control signal generated after a still reproduction command signal, and it is detected whether the nose bar exists within a vertical blanking period or not in a still reproduction state. If the noise bar exists within the vertical blanking period, the still reproduction state is continued. In the case that the noise bar does not exist within the vertical blanking period, the magnetic tape is run at a slow speed, and when the noise bar gets into the vertical blanking period, the feeding of the magnetic tape is stopped.
