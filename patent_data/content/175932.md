# Method for determination of optimum parameters for stress screening of electronic components and circuit boards.

## Abstract
A method for determination of optimum parameters for stress screening of electronic components, printed circuit cards or circuit boards. A statistically satisfactory group of cards is selected and divided into three samples. The first sample is subjected to temperature step stress testing to determine an upper temperature limit for stress screening. The second and third samples are each subjected to life tests at a differing lower temperature in order to determine the optimum activation energy for testing. The activation energy is calculated from a novel version of Arrhennius model and used to determine the ideal burn in time at a preselected operational or elevated temperature to provide optimum stress screening.

## Description
METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF OPTIMUM PARAMETERS FOR STRESS SCREENING OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND CIRCUIT BOARDSBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThe invention relates to stress screening of electronic components, LSI circuits, printed circuit cards or boards. More particularly, the invention concerns a method to determine the optimum time and temperature for a cost effective burn in or stress screening program for a given group of such components or cards.Discussion of the Prior ArtAs the complexity of electronic circuitry increases, the reliability of such circuitry is becoming critical to its use. Consequently, a significant need has developed to have quantitative information about the reliability of the circuitry embodied in electronic systems in order to have effective design evaluations, customer assurance and maintenance programs.Substantial effort has gone into the evaluation of wear out mechanisms in electronic circuitry. Various programs have been developed for life testing and creation of reliability models with respect to various electronic components. This is particularly true with respect to military and space systems where high reliability and long life of electronic components are paramount to cost effective utilization.A popular early characterization of reliability was related to a so called bath tub curve wherein the failure rate of a group of components was plotted against the operational time of utilization.Field data over such life testing established that, for certain components, the early life failure rate was significantly higher than the later life failure rate. Consequently, it became attractive to utilize burn in tests to eliminate the early life failures in testing programs, whereby over the actual operational time, the components exhibited a higher reliability. This approach was successful with respect to certain types of components, particularly where adequate amounts of life test data were taken. However, it has been recognized that the bath tub curve is not a particularly accurate means of characterizing the reliability of all types of integrated circuits. Moreover, where designs of circuitry change rapidly, as in LSI circuitry, the accumulation of life test data is not possible within the design change phases in usual practice today.Other types of screening have involved the use of elevated temperature cycles or elevated voltage cycles in order to provoke accelerated failure of components. These tests have also proved imprecise since no means was available for accurately determining what maximum safe level of temperature or voltage could be utilized in order to cause early life failures without damaging the remaining members of the group of components under test.Temperature acceleration for chemical reactions is fairly well modeled by the Arrhennius equation EMI2.1 which states that the rates of reaction between chemical substances are a function of temperature and the characteristic constant, activation energy, which is required to cause the given substances to react with each other. The engineering community expanded the application of this equation to the temperature screening of electronic hardware by substituting the rate of chemical reaction with the failure rates of components, and found that this law holds quite well for lower temperatures, but not as well for higher temperatures. For example, seeI. E. Arsenault and I. A. Roberts, Reliability and Maintainability of Electronic Systems, Computer Science Press, 1980.The temperature range discussed in the Arsenault and Roberts article goes as high as 2750C.The failure mechanisms of electronic hardware are bimodal and have commonly been referred to as infant mortality, freak mortality and main mortality. Various models have been developed for screening based upon the Arrhennius equation, life test data and recognition of failures or distributions of these three modes of failure. The most widely used of these models is perhaps the MIL HDBK model developed by the U. S.Department of Defense for military application.This model is based upon life test data with respect to a variety of components and it incorporates an Arrhennius factor which is, in effect, based upon assumed activation energy levels associated with the various failure mechanisms that are recognized to impact the group of components being tested. The MIL HDBK model has resulted in a recommended 168 hour burn in test which is widely followed by military suppliers and designers. The testing is performed at operational temperature, or at arbitrarily selected elevated temperatures.Various other models are discussed by Reynolds, note Measuring andModeling Integrated Circuit Failure Rates, Frederick H. Reynolds, published in Reliability in Electrical and Electronic Components andSystems, North Holland Publishing Company, 1982.It has been recognized by the applicant herein that a 168 hour burn in temperature routine is not cost effective for commercial purposes. It has also been recognized that the use of arbitrarily selected temperatures with respect to testing of bimodal or multimodal failure mechanisms related to a given group of electronic circuits, does not result in an optimum testing program. Thus, the amount of product which is removed by failure in such a stress testing program may include more or less than the ideal amount of infant mortality product which it is desired to take out and it may include a great deal more of the freak mortality distribution than is desired. At the current time, cost factors prohibit effective life testing of electronic circuitry for all except expensive military systems.However, for such systems, a need still exists to predict the temperature and time necessary to do accurate life testing to remove a satisfactory percentage of infant and freak mortality and leave the components which exhibit reliability with respect to main life.Summary of the InventionAccordingly, it is an object of the invention to describe a method for determination of optimum parameters for stress screening of electronic components, printed circuit cards and boards and LSI circuitry.It is a further object to describe a methodical approach for determination of the optimum temperature and optimum time for temperature accelerated screening of such components to achieve a desired effect, such as elimination of a predetermined portion of infant mortality failures among such components.These and other objects and methods are achieved in a method which utilizes a statistically suitable group of components or circuit boards of a given type. The selected group is divided into three samples. The first sample is subjected to a temperature step stress test. Thus, the sample of cards is step stressed by increasing the temperature at each readout time by a predetermined level. The readouts are taken at constant time intervals. Due to the expected log normal distribution of failures, the temperature step stress test produces a straight line if the results are plotted on log normal paper. Consequently, the point at which the failure rate suddenly increases, causing deviation from the straight line, determines the upper temperature limit for safely testing for the selected mode. The preceding temperature point, therefore, is the upper safe limit for accelerated temperature testing. The second and third samples of cards are each subjected to life testing at a different temperature selected to be below the safe testing range and separated by a 20 30 range.Each of the samples of cards is stressed at a constant temperature with the cards under power. The time to each failure is carefully monitored.This test, when plotted on log normal paper, again produces a straight line if there is unimodal distribution of failures. If the distribution is bimodal, an S shaped curve is obtained, and a double S plot is observed for trimodal distributions. From these shapes, individual subdistributions of failures can be extracted and the percentages of product belonging to each subdistribution can be determined. The percentages of product associated with the respective modes of distribution failure are found at the inflection points of the S curves as is explained in detail hereinafter.Since in each of the life test experiments, the temperature and time is known, plotting the temperature and time values on Arrhennius paper provides the value of activation energy associated with each distribution mode for burn in screening at a selected temperature and field hours equivalent of projected life.The activation energy can be verified by calculation utilizing a novel form of the Arrhennius equation developed by applicant.The method described is applicable for burn in screening to eliminate infant mortality in the case of bimodal distributions, but could be utilized for removal of freak mortality or life mortality testing in the event that such as required. However, at this time it is believed that cost effective testing for these parameters is not likely with respect to most commercial products utilizing available testers.Brief Description of the Drawings Other features and advantages of the invention are described hereinafter in connection with the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates the plot of a temperature step stress test carried out with respect to a sample of 40 logic printed circuit boards in the preferred embodiment Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the results of a 120 c life test carried out with respect to a sample of 40 logic printed circuit boards tested under the process of the preferred embodiment of the invention Figure 3 is a graph representing life test results taken at 135 c with respect to a sample size of 50 logic printed circuit boards tested as the third sample tested in the process described herein Figure 4 is a plot illustrating the activation energy calculated in accordance with the experiment at a use temperature of 450C and a predetermined field hours equivalent of 3,000 andFigure 5 is the field projection derived from the two life tests using the activation energy values obtained for infant mortality and freak mortality subdistributions. The use temperature was estimated to be 450C.Detailed Description of the InventionReferring now to the drawings and the experimental data included hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the invention is described.One hundred thirty cards of a given part number were used throughout the experiments. The cards were divided into three samples. A first sample was subjected to temperature stress testing and the second and third samples were subjected to life testing at different temperatures. The temperature step stress test was used to establish the upper temperature limit for screening cards. Table 1 summarizes the results of the temperature stress test, and Figure 1 represents a plot of the results on log normal paper. As was previously explained, it is expected that failures of electronic components due to a given failure mode will follow a log normal distribution. Accordingly, the failure rate or characteristics when plotted on log normal paper would be expected to follow a straight line. The experimental data represented by points 1 4 in Figure 1 bear this out.

Since we are interested in the weaker population comprising infant mortality, point 5 is of significance to us.Thus, it is evident from Figure 1 that the over stress point for the weaker distribution is point 5, corresponding to a temperature of 1500C. Therefore, point 4 appears to be the upper safe temperature limit for stress testing of cards of this part number.Point 4 corresponds to a temperature of about 140 c.It should be noted that points 5, 6 and 7 exhibit a straight line characteristic with respect to the stronger population or the remaining 75 percent of the cards. Deviation from that straight line is represented by point 8 corresponding to about 170 c, at which temperature massive card failures occurred. This deviation indicates that a trimodal failure distribution occurred with respect to the particular card under test. The information is not significant with respect to infant mortality screening, but could be useful in connection with life testing if the costs justified such a program. Life tests were carried out with respect to the second and third samples of cards at 120 c and 135 c, respectively. These temperatures were selected since they are lower than the maximum stress testing temperature identified by the step stress test, and they are separated by a reasonable range whereby data obtained in each of the life tests can be utilized to find the activation energy for stress testing with respect to the infant mortality failure mode.The results of the 1200 test are represented in Figure 2 and the results of the 135 life test are represented in Figure 3. It is evident fromFigure 2 that the first life test plot forms a double S shape with inflection points at about 6.5 percent and 25.0 percent cumulative failure levels. The lower figure corresponds to infant mortality. The plot of Figure 3 also represents a double S shape for trimodal distribution with inflection points at 3 percent and 10 percent cumulative failure levels, respectively. Infant mortality is indicated by the 3 percent figure.With a small sample size or small percentage of early life failures, it is common not to have the lower branch of the S shape corresponding to the early life fails. This portion of the first S shape can be reconstructed once the log normal distribution is verified by a straight line as in Figure 3. The segment of the first S shape between point 1 and the first inflection point between points 1 and 2 belongs to the infant mortality subdistribution. It is based on real experimental data.By taking three optional points from this segment and calculating what percentages of the total of 3 percent infant mortality the chosen 3 points constitute, a straight line is constructed. Such a line is shown to the right of data point 1. Further, by extending this line to intersect with 50 percent cumulative failure, the median time to failure for infant mortality subdistribution is obtained. Point B .Considering the fact that 50 percent of 3 percent is 1.5 percent, pointB1 is located. By repetition of this exercise for cumulative percentages which are less than 50, additional points are found and the lower branch of the S shape is reconstructed, as shown.Since the time to failure needed to establish the values of activation energy must be based on medians Points B,B1 this novel procedure is very helpful.The activation energy for the infant mortality failure mode can be determined by plotting point A of Figure 2 and point B of Figure 3 on theArrhennius graph illustrated in Figure 4. The activation energy is plotted with respect to a use temperature of 450 at a point established by a preselected value of 3,000 field hours equivalent use.Consequently, at a burn in temperature of 1400 1 hour of burn in time would be required whereas at a burn in temperature of 1250 a burn in time of 3 hours would be optimum. If a burn in temperature of 110 were desired, then a burn in temperature of 9 hours would be ideal.The activation energy associated with the infant mortality failure mode can also be calculated utilizing a modification of the Arrhennius equation indicated hereinafter. To make sure our data for te values ot activation energies were accurate, we verified them mathematically using theArrhennius odel. The Arrhennius Model is EMI12.1 By taking two values or R for two ditterent temperatures, T1 and T2 T2 T1 and by aividing R2 by R1, we obtain EMI12.2 Further, by a simple operation, the minus sign is eliminated and one gets EMI12.3 Hence,EMI12.4 There tore orEMI12.5 Divicing cumuietive iailure rates R from any two experimentai plots by the respective times, one obtains the instanta neous failure rates A2, MP and the equation Decomes EMI13.1 Taking natural logarithms on both sides or the equation 6 leads to an expression for activation energy, EA as a function of two different failure rates and respective absolute temperatures EMI13.2 where x2 failure rate at temperature T2 x1 failure rate at temerature T1 k 8.623 x 10 5 ev 0x Boltaman s Universai Conscantl T2 T1 and z2 x1 by combining the failure data from the individual plots of the step stress and two life tests, we have the following values for failure rates at medians x1 0.431 h step stress at 98 c 58 hours x2 0.3878 h lire Test at 120 c 7.55 hours x3 1.078 h lite Test at 135 c 1.4 hours By tne application of formula 71 A 135 120 1.017 x 8.623 x 0.937 ev 151368A 135 98 3.21 x 8.623 x 1.13 ev A 120 98 2.19 x 8.623 x 1.26 ev and the average of these three values amounts to 1.109 eV, which is in agreement with the experimental best estimate of 1.10v.Thus, the experimental value of activation energy of 1.1 is essentially verified by the calculated empirical value or 1.109 eV.Similar exercises could be carried out with respect to the freak mortality and main mortality failure modes in order to determine activation energies for those failure moaes. The calculated activation energy values would then permit determination of the temperature and time ror a life testing model if that is desired. It should be recognized, however, that life testing would utilize a substantial itlcrease in testing time and the resulting expense would probably be prohibitive for all but high quality military requirements.It is believed that the process definea herein comprises an effective metbodical approach for identifying optimum time It is believed that the process defined herein comprises an effective methodical approach for identifying optimum time and temperature parameters for burn in in a cost effective card screening procedure.A detailed description of the experimental examples is set forth hereinafter.Experimental Data Example 1One hundred forty cards, P N 4799890 were used throughout the experiments and inspected according to standard manufacturing procedures, and in addition, box tested to avoid zero time functional failures.The following conditions prevailed throughout the experiment. The burn in was static. The relative humidity never exceeded 4 percent. The cards were powered by providing 5.5 volts and ground to the pins according to the logic diagram. The 5.5 volts was measured at the pins of the mother boards at room ambient temperature of about 250C after the boards were populated. To ensure that every card was plugged in properly and received power, the cards were inserted hot with 5.0 volts applied to the boards according to the logic diagram. Power to the cards was disconnected at the moment of their removal from the chamber. Readouts were taken by means of the functional box testing. All the values are chamber ambient temperatures. The readouts during step stress were conducted on NIT, ASTRA, MPTS prime testers and in the functional box. Due to unreasonably long testing cycle and other inadequacies of testing on discrete testers, the readouts in the experiments beyond step stress were limited to the functional box test.1. Step Stress The temperature step stress was performed in 10 c steps and with the constant time of 58h per step with the exception of an 850C prestress conducted for 116 hours. In this experiment 40 cards from one lot were stepwise burned in up to 1650C chamber ambient, and failures were removed from the sample at the time of each readout.Table 1 summarizes the results. The third column shows the corrected temperature which was established on the basis of assumed activation energy of 1.0eV. The accuracy of 1.2ev covers adequately 0.8 to 1.2eV range. Column 5 represents the readouts of discrete testers1 which are necessary for identification of failing components and card repair.Column 7 shows the functional test results after the repair action was taken, which is at the moment the only proof that indeed the identified component has caused card failure.The results are plotted on log normal paper in Figure 1. After the stress step of 139 c 58b. raw 4 4 failures have been identified and removed from the sample. Failure analysis of failing cards performed after completion of the experiment has identified 2 cards as legitimate failures. The reduction by two of the sample size going into the next step moves the readout points 4 and higher towards lower a cumulative percent of failure numbers but it does not change the overall picture.From the plot in Figure 1 it is immediately apparent that we are dealing with a trimodal distribution and b the total population is split approximately 1 to 3. The first 25 percent of the product represents early failures, that is infant mortality plus freak mortality1 while the remaining 75 percent represents the strong main distribution MN .It is also evident that above 1700C the fallout rate is extremely high.The point 8 represents the percentages with the sample correction at point 4. The front portion of the plot would remain about the same with only a slight change of the slope, which would reflect an increased percentage of early failures. There appear to be two overstress points. They are point 5 which is overstress with regard to the weaker population of about 25 percent, and point 8 which is overstress for the stronger population of the remaining 75 percent of cards. Since we are interested in the weaker populations, point 5 is of primary concern.2. Life TestThe life test was carried out with respect to 40 cards at a temperature of 1200C as dictated by the step stress experiment. Test results are plotted in Figure 2. The objective of life test is to. establish the failure distributions and the activation energy values corresponding to them. In order to accomplish the latter, at least 3 data points are desired. One point for each distribution is obtained from step stress, another from the first life test, which was decided to be at 120 C and the third point. should be obtained from a life test at another temp erature within 140 c.These cards were burned in at 1200C with predetermined readout times. In addition to box test readouts, the voltage change on the power supply side were monitored. It was found that for each card which developed an electrical short, the voltage would drop by 0.013V on the average. This crude method was helpful in obtaining some intermediate points, which allowed to draw the curve with greater confidence.It is evident from Figure 2 that the plot forms a double S shape with the inflection points at about 6.5 percent and 25.0 percent cumulative failure. The 25.0 percent is consistent with the estimated 25 percent inFigure 1.The three distributions observed are infant mortality which constitutes 6.5 percent of total population with the standard deviation estimate ofS 1.6 freak distribution of about 18.5 percent with the estimate s 0.7 and main distribution of 75.0 percent of total population with an estimate s 0.3. Figure 5 is a semi quantitative illustration of the three observed distributions. Because of a large variety of components , and hence, a broad spectrum of possible failure mechanisms, it is expected that the apparent activation energies for the three different distributions are going to be different. The fact that observed modes do not belong to the same distribution, i.e. different values for the estimates of standard deviations, indicates just that.The cards are identical in every respect and the only factor which allows differentiation is the different combination of the failure mechanisms causing them to fail. Under such circumstances the possibility of activation energies being similar is very remote indeed.Therefore, in consideration of burn in screening, each distribution should stand on its own merits. That is to say that the activation energy characteristic for failures in the main distribution cannot be used in establishing burn in conditions aimed at removal of infant mortality distribution or a part of it or for removal of freak distribution.The second life test involved 50 cards belonging to a different lot.Results are plotted in Figure 3. This life test was carried out at 135 c. Although it has not been completed to reach 50 percent cumulative failures, the 12.5 percent fallout and the first S shape was attained.This allows the use of time and temperature data points to establish the activation energy for infant mortality distribution of average of 4.75 percent and the freak distribution of about 13.5 percent.3. Activation EnergyThe temperature acceleration is extremely sensitive to the activation energy. Therefore, the determination of activation energy must be very accurate. Since the life test at 1350C was not completed, only infant mortality and freak distributions produce sufficient data to determine the range of activation energy applicable to these subdistributions. Reading the temperature and times from Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3,Points A, B and C for the cumulative percentages of fallout, applying short B I time correction to the 135 c test data and plotting the points on Arrhennius paper, we obtain the results illustrated in Figure 4.The line determined by the Points A, B and C from Figures 1 Figure 2 andFigure 3 is inclined under the angle corresponding to the value of the activation energy of 1.lev. This is the experimental value for infant mortality failures.As to the main distribution, the Ea can be based only on two data points from the two completed experiments. The values of Ea based on median time to failure are Freak distribution Ea 1.3eV Main distribution Ea 0.55eVAgain, the main distribution data are based partly on an extrapolated step stress curve, which lowers our confidence. Since we are dealing with a complex structure in terms of variety of components and possible failure mechanisms, the activation energy is called apparent. Since the activation energies for various types of components are expected to be within 0.5eV to 2.0eV an additional arbitrary line for the value of 1.0ev is drawn in Figure 4 to illustrate the technique for determination of the shortest stress screening time to achieve 3000 field hours equivalent, for a given field use temperature and desired screening temperature limit. If our experimental value of 1.lev was applied, the screening times would be shorter.ConclusionThe combination of step stress and life test reveal multimodal distribution of failures. These experiments allow determination of the percentage of potential weaklings, determination of activation energy for each mode observed in the product, and as a consequence, determination of burn in parameters such as temperature and time to achieve desired effect of screening. Hereinbefore there has been described a method for determination of optimum parameters for stress screening of electronic components, printed circuit cards or circuit boards. A statistically satisfactory group of cards is selected and divided into three samples. The first sample is subjected to temperature step stress testing to determine an upper temperature limit for stress screening. The second and third samples are each subjected to life tests at a differing lower temperature in order to determine the optimum activation energy for testing. The activation energy is calculated from a novel version of Arrhennius model and used to determine the ideal burn in time at a preselected operational or elevated temperature to provide optimum stress screening.
