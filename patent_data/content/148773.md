# VIBRATING TROUGH TOBACCO SEPARATOR AND CLASSIFIER

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for the separa tion and classification of tobacco into two fractions, e.g., into heavies and lights. A stream of fluid is employed to produce a stratified bed 52 of the tobacco, preferably in cooperation with vibration of the tobacco, in which the tobacco is suppor ted by the fluid and is stratified as a function of particle size, density and weight. The stream entrains the lighter tobacco particles located at the top of the stratified bed and removes them to a suitable receptacle 41 , where they are received and collected.
