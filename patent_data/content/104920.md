# DNA sequences, recombinant DNA molecules and processes for producing swing growth hormone like polypeptides.

## Abstract
DNA sequences, recombinant DNA molecules and hosts transformed with them which produce polypeptides display ing a growth enhancing biological activity of swine growth hormone. These polypeptides are useful in improving the rate of growth of and meat production and quality in swine.
