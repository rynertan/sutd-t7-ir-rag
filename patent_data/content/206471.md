## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing pyrrolo quinoline quinone, more particularly a process for microbiologically preparing the same by use of bacteria. Pyrrolo quinoline quinone hereinafter abbreviated to PQQ is 2,7,9 tricarboxy 1H pyrrolo 2,3 f quinoline 4,5 dione having the formula PQQ is purified and crystallized as a coenzyme of methanol dehydrogenase produced by methanol utilizing bacteria S.A. Salisbury One of processes for producing PQQ is organic chemical synthesis JACS. Vol. 103, pp. 5599 5600, 1981 . However, the organic chemical synthesis is not economical, because the synthesis needs so many steps that it takes a very long time until it is completed and it requires troublesome steps for removal of isomers and various other by products. Furthermore, the yield of PQQ is not so high. Another process is a microbiological one Japanese published unexamined patent application 59 113896 . However, this process is not economical either, because the yield is as low as 0.1 0.3 x 10 ⁸ mole ℓ hereinafter referred to as M , i.e., 4 12 µg per litre. The present inventor has been studying how to obtain PQQ by use of bacteria. The inventor has found that the bacteria given below are capable of producing a large amount of PQQ the genera According to a first aspect of the present invention, a processs for producing PQQ is provided wherein the bacterium defined below is cultured in a medium containing, as a carbon source, a source of methanol and or a source of methylamine, and then PQQ is recovered from a culture broth or a supernatant of the culture broth, said bacterium having the capability of utilizing methanol and or methylamine to produce PQQ and being selected from the genus EP A 0164943 also relates to the production of PQQ by culturing bacteria. However, this document contains no reference to the bacteria used in the present invention other than some of the genus Any bacterium may be employed as long as it has capability of utilizing methanol and or methylamine to produce a large amount of PQQ and belongs to genus According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of pyrrolo quinoline quinone which comprises culturing a bacterium as defined below in a medium containing as a carbon source a source of methylamine and recovering pyrrolo quinoline quinone thus produced from a culture broth or a supernatant of the culture broth, wherein the bacterium possesses the capability of utilizing methylamine to produce pyrrolo quinoline quinone and belongs to the species Examples of suitable bacteria for use in the methods of the invention are Variants obtained from the above strains may also be employed. The medium employed has to contain, as a carbon source, a source of methanol and or a source of methylamine CH₃NH₂ . Methylamine hydrochloride may be used as a source for methylamine. Concentrations of methanol and or methylamine in the medium vary depending on bacteria employed. They are usually 3 wt. or less, preferably 1.5 wt. or less for methanol and 1 wt. or less, preferably 0.5 wt. or less for methylamine, on the basis of the medium, from a practial point of view. The medium further will generally contain proper amounts of usual nitrogen sources and inorganic and or organic salts. Ammonium sulphate, urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, peptone, meat extract, etc. may be used as the nitrogen source. Phosphates, magnesium salts, iron salts, and, if necessary, a small amount of the other metal salts are used as the inorganic and or organic salts. Furthermore, amino acid, nucleic acid, vitamin, yeast extract, malt extract and other growth promoting materials may be added. If the bacteria essentially require a nutrient, the medium has to contain necessary materials to this effect. Two to four wt. of NaCl is added to the medium when the bacterium employed is Culturing conditions vary depending upon bacteria employed. Also usually necessary, from a practical viewpoint, is to select a culture temperature and pH of the culture broth within the usual ranges of from 25 C to 45 C and of from 6 to 8, respectively, taking into account the growth and propagation of bacteria employed. When the nitrogen source is an ammonium salt, in particular, the pH of the medium becomes more acidic as the bacteria propagate. Controlling the pH of the culture broth sometimes has to be done by adding alkaline materials, for example, ammonia, caustic potash potassium hydroxide or caustic soda sodium hydroxide , in order to keep it at a constant level during the culturing. Ammonia is preferred. Culturing may be effected batchwise or continuously. PQQ produced after the culturing is recoverable by any means familiar to those skilled in the art. For instance, solid liquid separation, for example, filtration and centrifugation, may be applied to the culture broth in order to obtain supernatant by separation of cells from a culture broth. The supernatant and culture broth as it is before, for example, the filtration, which contains cells, may be used for the recovery. Recovery from the supernatant or the culture broth is effected, for example, by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration of concentrate, solvent extraction of a dried product or affinity chromatography. Identification of PQQ thus recovered is made by, for example, paper chromatography, thin layer chromatography, elementary analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry mass spectrometry, UV absorption spectroscopy and or high performance liquid chromatography. Quantitative analysis may be made by use of a D glucose dehydrogenase activity deletion variant of The present invention is illustrated by the following examples.
