# Ammonia production process.

## Abstract
The secondary reformer of an ammonia production process is fed with moderately oxygen enriched air such as from a simple air separation plant producing also nitrogen, which preferably is used to aid start up or shut down or to keep the process plant in a hot standby condition. In such or similar processes energy economy is improved by allowing 5 15 of the starting hydrocarbon to pass through unre formed. Hydrocarbon feedstock and steam are preheated in furnace 18, partly reacted in adiabatic catalyst 22, reheated in furnace 24 and reacted in secondary reformer 30 with oxygen enriched air from air separation plant 27. The secondary reforming reaction is incomplete outlet CHâ‚„ 0.7
