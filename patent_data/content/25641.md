# Process for purifying a crude ketone containing small amounts of aldehydes.

## Abstract
Known techniques of recovering a purified ketone substantially free from aldehydes by contacting a crude ketone containing small amounts of aldehydes with an alkali and then distilling the treated crude ketone are dis advantageous since, in order to prevent de condensation of the high boiling point condensates into which the alde hydes have been converted, it is necessary to maintain a low distillation temperature and high ketone concentration of the distillation bottoms. These problems are now over come by employing a solid alkali composition composed of an alkali metal oxide and or hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal oxide and or hydroxide and silicon dioxide in which the mole ratio of alkali metal alkaline earth metal is from 1 1 to 1 15, and of alkali metal silicon is from 1 0.25 to 1 5. This technique can be used to treat crude acetone fractions obtained by acid cleavage of cumene hydroper oxide and subsequent distillation of the cleavage reaction product.
