## Description
This invention relates to an optical semiconductor device such as a quantum well laser, a quantum well light modulator, a quantum well optical waveguiding circuit, etc., which contains a quantum well optical waveguiding region, utilizing a quantum effect within semiconductor thin films formed by molecular beam epitaxy MBE , metal organic chemical vapor deposition MO CVD , etc. Recently, a single crystal growth technique for the formation of thin films such as molecular beam epitaxy MBE , metal organic chemical vapor deposition MO CVD , etc., has been developed which enables the formation of thin film growth layers having a thickness of as thin as approximately As mentioned above, a single crystal growth technique, such as molecular beam epitaxy or metal organic chemical vapor deposition, has resulted in the practical use of high quality semiconductor lasers having a new multiple layered structure. Figure 2 shows a conventional laminated structure of a single quantum well laser, having carrier reservoir layers, which is made by the successive growth of an n GaAs buffer layer As the quantum well structure, in addition to the single quantum well mentioned above, a multi quantum well having the AlAs mole fraction i.e., x in a Ga Optical semiconductor laser devices of this invention may overcome the above discussed disadvantages and other numerous drawbacks and deficiencies of the prior art. First and second aspects of the present invention are defined in the attached claims 1 and 2, and these may utilise laminated thin layers of two kinds of binary compounds to form part of structures thereof, the structures achieving a quantum well effect. The two kinds of binary compounds are, in a preferred embodiment, GaAs and AlAs, GaSb and AlSb, InAs and AlAs, or InP and GaP. The thin layers are, in a preferred embodiment, successively grown to form a laminated structure by molecular beam epitaxy or metal organic chemical vapor deposition. Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the objects of 1 providing an optical semiconductor laser device which does not have swayed changes in the energy gap at the interface between the growth layers, but has an ideal quantum well optical waveguide structure and providing a quantum well laser which has characteristics attaining an excellent quantum effect without undergoing a detremental effect i.e., a decrease of the quantum effect resulting from the non uniformity and or the irregularity of the composition in the interface between the growth layers. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a distribution of the AlAs mole fraction i.e., x in a Ga The device is produced, in the same manner as in that shown in Figure On an n GaAs substrate, an n GaAs buffer layer having a thickness of Then, an n metal electrode and a p metal electrode are formed on the bottom of the n GaAs substrate and the p cap layer, respectively, by a vacuum evaporation technique, resulting in a double heterostructure laser device having a superlatticed structure and, as desired, a striped structure for contracting an injected current thereby. When an electric current is injected into the resulting laser device through the n and the p electrode electrodes, a light is waveguided due to the superlatticed structure and carriers are confined within the active layer Figure The quantum well layers and optical waveguide layers in the above mentioned Examples of this invention are composed of two kinds of binary compounds such as GaAs and AlAs, but are not limited thereto. As the binary compounds, semiconductor substances such as GaSb and AlSb, InAs and AlAs, InP and GaP, etc., can be also used for this invention.
