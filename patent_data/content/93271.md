## Description
GROWTH PROMOTION OF MONOGASTRIC ANIMALSBackground of the Invention Historically, many antibiotics have been used in conjunction with animal feed in attempts to promote growth in monogastric animals, e.g., poultry and swine.The use of those antibiotics which are also used in the treatment of humans has not been readily accepted because of the possible development of pathogenic microorganisms resistant to such antibiotics.Additionally, the commercially used growth promoting antibiotics progressively decline in growth promoting activity in the later phases of production. The commercially available antibiotics used for growth promotion of monogastric animals, such as penicillin, the tetracyclines and sulfamethazine are thus not highly effective over the entire production period.Summary of the Invention It has now been discovered that Teichomycin A2, its physiologically acceptable salts, its physiologically acceptable esters, and its physiologically acceptable amides are effective as growth promoting agents growth promoters in monogastric animals, that is agents capable of improving either or both the rate o 3ot cr te feed conversion efficiency of monogastric animals . it appears that Teichomycin A2, and its physiologically acceptable salts, esters and amides selectively alter the balance of normal intestinal microorganisms, favoring those microorganisms which are most beneficial for optimum growth and,or the feed conversion efficiency of the animal.Teichomycin A has shown unique growth promotion activity in swine, where a high level of improvement in average aa ly gain has been demonstrated in both the growing and finishing phases of production. The high level of activity shown by Teichomycin A2 in the finisher phase is not characteristic of the known antibiotic growth promoters. Commercia swine growth promoters such asAureo S P 250 a trademark of American Cyanamid Co. do not show sustaIned activity over the entire production period and are not efficacious in the finisher phase. The effectiveness of Teichomycin A is a monogastric growth promoter is due to its selective activity against anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria which are normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract. Teichomycin A2 alters the micro flora in such a way as to increase the efficiency of nutrient production and absorption. The antimicrobial profile of Teichomycin A2 is uniquely different from that of other antimicrobials such as kanamycin, neomycin, dimetridazole, and chloramphenicol which are not active as growth promoting agents for monogastric animals. Teichomycin A2 is highly active against bacteria such as Streptococcus andClostridium as compared to the non growth promoting antibictics. Compared to commercial monoc astrlc crown promoters, Teichomycin A2 exhibits a unique influence on the proliferation of normal inhabitants of the small intestine and caecum. In the presence ofTeichomycin A2, the growth of Streptococcus andClostridium species is inhibited, in contrast to penicillin which does not inhibit these organisms in vivo. Teichomycin A2 is described and claimed inU.S. Patent 4,239,751, patented December 16, 1980. The physiologically acceptable salts, physiologically acceptable esters and physiologically acceptable amides of Teichomycin A2 are readily prepared employing procedures weil known in the art. illustrative examples of the physiologically acceptable salts, esters and amides of Teichomycin A2 are further described below. Teichomycin A2 contains free carboxyl groups and thus exhibits the common property of an organic acid in that it forms salts. Representative of the inorganic bases forming physiologically acceptable cationic salts with Teichomycin A2 are, for example, the alkali metal hydroxides such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide the alkali metal carbonates and bicarbonates such as lithium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate the alkaline earth metal hydroxides and carbonates such as calcium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate and like inorganic bases. Illustrative of the organic bases forming physiologically acceptable salts with Teichomycin A2 are the primary, secondary and tertiary C1 C4 lower alkyl and lower hydroxyalkyl amines such as ethylamine, isopropylamine, diethylamine, methyl n butylamine, ethanolamine.and diethanolamine. The ammonium salts of Teichomycin A2 are prepared with ammonia or various ammonium hydroxides. Physiologicaily acceptable esters can readily be prepared by esterification of the carboxyl groups ofTeichomycin At to g ve esters such as alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters ad aryl esters. Typical alkyl esters are, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or butyl esters. Typical cycloalkyl esters are cyclopropyl and cyclohexyl esters. Typical of the aryl esters are those such as the phenyl ester. Esters can also be made by acylation of one or more of the derivatives described herein having hydroxyl groups. For example, esters are made by acylation using groups such as formyl, acetyl, cyclohexylacetyl and benzoyl groups. Esters such as phosphate esters, can also be prepared from the hydroxyl groups cf Teichomycin A2. Physiologically acceptable amide derivatives ofTeichomycin A2 can be prepared employing amines such as ethyl glycine, ethyl amine, diethylamine, N methyl piperazine, or by employing acids such as acetic or succinic acid. As used hereIn the term physiologically acceptable when used in conjuction wit salts, esters or amides refers to those salts, esters or amides of Teichomycin A2 which will not cause significant adverse physiological effects when administered to an animal at dots ages conslstent with the method of the present er. tion. Teichomycin A2 or its physiologically acceptable salt, ester or amide means at least one growth promoter selected from the group consisting of Teichomycin A2, its physiologically acceptable salts, its physiologically acceptable esters and its physiologically acceptable amides.In the method and coirrositions described herein, either Teicho mycin A2 or a physiologically acceptable salt, este or amide of Teichomycin A2 can be utilized individually or various combinations of Teichomycin A2 and its physiologically acceptable salts, esters an amides can be employed. The method of the present invention contemplates treating a monogastric animal with one of the composItions described herein. Teichomycin A2 or its physiologically acceptable salt, ester or amide is administered to the monogastic animal in an amount sufficient to improve the rate of growth andjor the feed conversion efficiency of the animal. The Teichomycin A2 or its physiologically acceptable salt, ester or amide can be administered to the animal at a rate of from 0.04 to 10 milligrams mg of the growth promoter per kilogram kg of animal body weight per day, preferably from 0.08 to 6 mg of the growth promoter per kg of animal body weight per day. The exact amount of the growth promoter to be employed will vary depending upon fast rs such as the species of animal or the si e weight, age, and health of the animal.For swine,Teichomycin A2 or its physiologically acceptable salt ester or amide can be administered to the animal at a rat of from 0.04 to mg cf the growth promoter per kg of animal body weight per day, preferably from 0.08 to mc of the growth promoter per kg of animal body weight per day. For poultry, a rate of from 0.1 to 10 m of the growth promoter per kg of animal body weight per day is suitable for administration, with a rate of from 0.2 to 6 mg of the growth promoter per kg of animal body weight per day preferred. In particular cases, the concentration to be administered may be determined by conventional dose titration techniques. The Teichomycin A2 or its physiologically acceptable salt, ester or amide is preferably administered orally to the monogastric animals as part of their normal food for example, in admixture with a usual solid feedstuff or in the form of a slow release feed pellet. The antibi tic material is incorporated into the feed at a concentration of from 1 to 100 parts pet mill on hereinafter ppm by weight of the ultimate composition and preferably in the range of from 2 to 50 ppm by weight of the ultimate composition. For commercial use, it is convenient to provide a feed additive premix. mIneral supplement or concentrate containing Teichomycin A2 cr its physiologically acceptable salt, ester or amide in a proportion such that a predetermined quantity of the premix or concentrate may be added to a quantity of complete feed.The feed additive premix or concentrate may contain from 0.05 to 80 by weight of Teichomycin A2 or its psiciogicaliy acceptable salt, ester or amide. The premlx feed ingredient is physiologically acceptable carrier such as soybean meal, corn meal or ground corn or other appropriate feed material. Premix ingredients may also include appropriate supplements such as vitamin or mineral supplements. E. W. Crampton, et al. Applied Animal Nutritic. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, California, 1969 and D. C. Church Livestock Feeds and Feeding, aistributed by O Books, Corvallis, Oregon, 1977 further describe the preparation of normal feedstuffs and the process of admixing compounds such as Teichomycin A2, or its physiologically acceptable salts, esters or amides with feed compositions, premixes and concentrates and are incorporated herein by reference. Teichomycin A can also be utilized in admixture with the mycelium resulting from the culture medium in which the Teichomycin A2 is produced. This mycellum mixture may optionally be combined with appropriate feed ingredients such as those described above to obtain suitable premixes, concentrates or complete feeds. The method of the present invention also contemplates treating monogastric animals, with one of the compositions containing Teichomycin A2 or its physiologically acceptable salt, ester or amide in combination with one or more additives such as coccidiostats, antibiotics, minerals, vitamins or any other physiologically beneficial agents employed in animal husbandry.Description of the Preferred Embodiments The following examples describe representative embodiments contemplated by the inventors of carrying ot the invention.
