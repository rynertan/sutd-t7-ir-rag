# Wall covering system.

## Abstract
Boarding for walls and the like, where there is used a series of parallel wainscoting elements which are secured by fastening clips or the like. In order to simplify the setting up and creating the possibility for the most possible preliminary handling the parallel wainscoting elements are undercut at all edges. At the end of the series of wainscoting elements, and between the wainscoting elements respectively there are present strip shaped lining mouldings or plates 25, 26, 29 which can have varying breadths and which are overlap ped along the adjacent side edge of the undercut in the wainscoting element 18 . The strip shaped moulding 26 is covered at the upper edge preferably at its upper edge by a horizontal cover moulding 27 . This should have undercut ting at the upper edge which gives the possibility for variation of the overlapping between this and an adjacent, outer moulding.
