## Description
A GEAR TRAIN The present invention relates to the transmission of rotary power via gear trains and also to braking systems that employ gears. Conventional gears have not been employed to apply a negative torque to a power transmitting shaft in order to act as brake on the shaft. Additionally most braking systems require the dissipation of heat to release the energy absorbed by the braking system. Thus, it is a disadvantage of known braking systems that their efficiency depends upon the ability to dissipate heat. Further to the above there is not readily available variable speed gear transmissions of a simple nature. Known systems are generally complex and accordingly have the disadvantage that they are expensive and require considerable maintenance. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantages. There is disclosed herein a gear train comprising a first and second gear mounted for independent rotation about a first axis, a third and fourth gear coupled so as to rotate together about a second axis generally parallel to the first axis, said third gear being meshingly engaged with said first gear and said fourth gear being meshingly engaged with said second gear, a fifth and sixth gear coupled so as to rotate together about a third axis, also generally parallel to said first axis, said fifth gear being meshingly engaged with said third gear and said sixth gear being meshingly engaged with said fourth gear, and wherein said third or fourth gears are mounted so as to be movable angularly at a fixed radius about said first axis. A preferred form of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the a√ßcompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a schematic front elevation depicting a gear train adapted to be used as a brake Figure 2 is a schematic side elevation of the gear train of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a schematic end elevation of a variable speed gear train and Figure 4 is a schematic side elevation of the gear train of Figure 3. In Figure 1 there is schematically depicted a gear train 10 including a rotary power input shaft 11 to which there is to be applied a braking force. The gear train 10 includes a first pair of gears 12 and 13 which are fixed to the shaft 11 so as to rotate therewith. The shaft 11 is rotatably supported within a frame or casing 14 so as to be rotatable about its longitudinal axis. Also supported by the casing 14 is a further shaft 15 which rotatably supports a pair of gears 16 and 17 which are independently rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the shaft 15. The casing 14 is provided with a slot 18 which extends angularly at a fixed radius about the longitudinal axis of the shaft 15.The slot 18 receives a fixed shaft 19 which would be attached to a rigid frame 20. The shaft 19 rotatably supports a pair of gears 21 and 22 which are fixed to each other so as to rotate as a pair. As an example, the gears 12, 16 and 21 could be provided with 19 teeth, while the gears 13, 17 and 22 could be provided with 15 teeth. Accordingly with the gears meshingly engaged as illustrated and with the casing 14 at a predetermined position, the gear train 10 would be rotated by the shaft 11 without any braking force being applied to the shaft 11. However upon the casing being moved about the longitudinal axis of the shaft 15 a negative torque will be applied to the shaft 11. More particularly as the casing 14 is caused to rotate about the axis of the shaft 15, the gears 21 and 22 move angularly about the axis of the shaft 15 until the tolerance between the gears is taken up.Thereafter, any further force applied to the casing 14 will cause a negative torque to be applied to the shaft 11 via the gears 12 and 13. The above negative torque results from the rotation of the gears 21 and 22 about the axis of the shaft 15 so as to bias the gear train 10 to a position wherein it acts as a rigid member as opposed to rotatable gears. In an application of the above discussed gear train 10, the shaft 11 may extend to the wheel of a motor vehicle. Accordingly the input torque to the planetary gear train 10 via the shaft 11 will determine the negative torque applied to the shaft to thereby apply a braking force to the motor vehicle wheel. Under conditions where the load which may be applied to the shaft 11 varies, the negative torque applied to the shaft would vary accordingly. Thus, any loss of coefficient of friction between the wheel and the rigid surface will cause a corresponding drop in braking output by the gear train 10 as the force being applied to the casing 14 is dependent on the torque being applied to shaft 11. It should be appreciated that the above gear train 10 will function providing the number of teeth on the gears ensures that the annular velocity of gears 12 and 13 would remain the same. However the gear train 10 will operate as a braking system when in addition the number of teeth or gears 12 and 17 is different to gears 21 and 17. Now with reference to Figures 3 and 4 wherein there is depicted a power transmitting gear train 20. The gear train 20 extends between an input shaft 21 and an output shaft 22. The gear train 22 includes a frame or casing 23 which is rotatably supported on the shafts 21 and 22 so as to be rotatable about their common axis and relative to the shafts. The casing 23 supports a first shaft 24 which in turn rotatably supports a pair of gears 25 and 26 which are rotatable about the shaft 24. Additionally the casing 23 rotatably supports a further shaft 34 which in turn rotatably supports a pair of gears 27 and 28. The gears 25 and 26 are fixed together so as to rotate as a pair while the gears 27 and 28 are also fixed together so as to rotate as a pair.Fixed to the shaft 21 is a gear 29 which is meshingly engaged with the gears 25 and 27 while fixed to the shaft 22 is a gear 30 which is meshingly engaged with the gears 26 and 28. The shafts 21 and 22 are relatively rotatable about their common longitudinal axis. Attached to the shaft 34 are two sprockets 31 which engage with chain portions 32. The chain portions 32 are fixed to the casing 23 while additionally the casing is provided with a slot 33 which extends angularly at a fixed radius about the longitudinal axis of the shafts 21 and 22.The shaft 34 is slidably supported within the slot 33 so that the pair of gears 27 and 28 are movable relative to the casing 23 in an angular direction about the shafts 21 and 22. As an example, in the gear train 20 the gears 25, 27 and 30 could be provided with 19 teeth while the gears 26, 29 and 28 could be provided with 15 teeth. In operation of the above gear train 20, with the casing 23 stationary the shaft 21 would turn the shaft 22 at the ratio of 1.6 1. With the casing 23 free to move, the reaction of the load being applied to the shaft 22 would force the casing 23 to turn against the rotation of the shaft 21. Accordingly as the load applied to the shaft 22 increases the casing will move until the input torque being applied to the shaft 21 equals the load torque being applied to the shaft 22 whereat the gear train 20 will act as a rigid coupling and rotate with the shafts 21 and 22. Variation of speed differences between the shafts 21 and 22 may be adjusted by movement of the shaft 34 about its own axis so as to move the shaft 34 along the slot 33. This is achieved by interaction of the sprockets 31 with the fixed chain portions 32. In use of the above gear train 20, it could be coupled to a constant speed 50 cycle induction motor, e.g. as used in electric rail locomotives. The 50 cycle motor would be mounted on bearings so that both the rotor and stator could rotate. The direction of the stator would be reversed relative to the rotor and connected to the rotor by a set of gears so that the stator can drive the rotor at half rotor speed. When the stator is held stationary the rotor would then rotate at full motor speed. A gear train 10 could be connected to the stator so as to control its movement while additionally a gear train 20 could be attached to the rotor shaft and load. The casing 23 of the gear train 20 could be controlled by a control motor so that the speed of the casing 23 relative to the shafts 21 and 22 could be varied. With the stator releas ed by the gear train 10 the control motor could drive the armature against rotation until the load was stationary.
