## Description
A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN ORGANIC COMPOUND BY EXTRUSION OF SULFUR FROM SULFUR CONTAINING ORGANIC COMPOUNDS U. S. 3,929,859 discloses a process for extruding sulfur from a thiodipropionitrile of the formula NC R S R CN to produce a dinitrile of the formula NC R R CN wherein R, R , R andR are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals and wherein R and R have the same number of carbon atoms and R and R have the same number of carbon atoms. The process described in this patent, however, is limited to producing dinitriles from thiodinitriles. The present invention provides a process for the extrusion of sulfur from sulfur containing organic compounds other than thiodinitriles by contacting said sulfur containing organic compounds at a temperature of 200 700 C. with a sulfur acceptor. The sulfur containing organic compound which can be reacted in accordance with the present invention can be described by the following formula R S R wherein R and R are the same or different unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radicals. Each of R and R can be independently substituted with a wide variety of different radicals such as cyano, chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxyl, carboxylate. Also, each of R and R preferably has 12 or less carbon atoms, more preferably 8 or less carbon atoms. Examples of hydrocarbon substituents found useful as R and orR are methyl, ethyl, allyl, butyl, hydroxyphenyl, cyanomethyl, methyl propionyl, cyanoethyl and the like. Preferred R and R groups are methyl, allyl, butyl, hydroxyphenyl, cyanomethyl, cyanoethyl methyl propionyl. The present process is carried out by contacting the sulfur containing organic compound with the sulfur acceptor at a reaction temperature from about 200 7000C. Within this broad temperature range, temperatures between 300 6500C have been shown to give more desirable results, with temperatures in the range of 400 6000C. being especially useful. Within the temperature ranges claimed, the reaction of the present invention can be conducted in the vapor or liquid phase. Of special interest in the present invention are reactions conducted in the vapor phase. Of course, to obtain a liquid phase reaction within the higher temperature ranges of the invention, pressure must be applied. It is anticipated that a reactor pressurized with an inert gas, hydrogen and or acrylonitrile would give the most desirable results. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the mode of the reaction i.e. vapor phase or liquid phase depends at least to some extent on the sulfur containing organic compound selected as the starting material. A sulfur containing organic compound with a relatively great number of carbon atoms cannot be vaporized under practical reaction conditions at temperatures approaching 7000C. Thus, there is a practical limit on the molecular size of sulfur containing organic compounds which can be reacted in the vapor phase. This practical limit can be readily determined by those skilled in the art by routine experimentation. As a rough guide, it has been found that vapor phase reactions become difficult when the R or R group in the molecule of the sulfurcontaining organic compound has more than about 8 carbon atoms. The sulfur acceptor useful in accordance with the present invention can be selected from a wide variety of different materials. Most suitably used are solids which are composed of a metal or metal containing material. Among the metals that may be employed in the reaction, those selected from elements of GroupIIIA, IVA, VA, VIA, IB, IIB, VB, VIB, VIIB or VIII are preferred. Of these numerous metals, it has been found that iron, nickel, manganese, copper, silver and tin are of greatest interest with the use of iron or copper being of greatest significance because of the especially desirable yields obtained using these solids. These metals may be used alone or in alloys or mixtures. The reaction conditions other than the temperature limitation are not critical. However, there are certain preferred aspects of the reaction to give most desirable results. In the vapor phase reactions, it has been found that the use of an additional gas in the reactant feed is desirable to purge the products through the reactor. When a heterogenous solid is employed, this purge gas is also believed to draw the products off the surface of the solid and into the effluent from which the dinitrile is recovered. Essentially any gas may be employed in the reaction. Representative examples of these purge gases include nitrogen, air, acrylonitrile, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, argon, hydrogen, methanol and the like. Of special interest as far as the purge gases are concerned is the use of hydrogen, acrylonitrile or mixture thereof. These gases appear to not only act as a purge gas but also act as promoters of the reaction of the sulfurcontaining organic compounds to give desirably high yields. The pressure employed in the reaction may vary widely. Subatmospheric, superatmospheric or atmospheric pressure may be employed. The contact time may range from less than a second to a number of hours depending on the reaction temperature and state of reaction. The reactor employed in the invention can be an open tube with an inlet for reactants and an outlet for products, the tube being at least partially filled with a sulfur acceptor. The reactor can take the form of either a fixed bed reactor with a solid fixed in the reaction zone or a fluid bed reactor. Although a fixed bed reactor has been employed in all of the experiments of theSpecific EdixErents, it is anticipated that a fluid bed reactor could be employed to great advantage in the present invention. When a heterogeneous solid is employed, there is a tendency for the heterogeneous solid to become sulfided during the course of the reaction.This sulfiding is especially noticeable when a metal is employed. As the catalyst becomes sulfided, it tends to lose activity for the desired reaction. Even though some catalysts are enhanced by partial sulfiding, there is a point of sulfiding at which regeneration appears to be desirable. Normally, the regeneration involves at least partial return of the sulfided metal to the metallic state or a lower valence state. This can be suitably accomplished by the action of hydrogen or another reducing agent on the catalyst or in a more convenient method, the catalyst may be oxidized with air and then reduced with a reducing agent. Using either technique, the catalytic activity of the heterogeneous solid has been observed to be restored. The recovery and purification of the extrusion product is normally very convenient.The reactor effluent contains unreacted sulfurcontaining organic compound, the extrusion product and various organic compounds derived by breaking the sulfur out of the sulfur containing organic compound without joining the carbon atom of theR and R groups. These different materials can be separated from one another by conventional tech niques, such as distillation and the like. The present invention finds significant use in the manufacture of various different compounds. For example, it is possible in accordance with the present invention by suitably selecting the starting material to produce n butane, 1,5hexadiene, n octane, 4,4 dihydroxy diphenol, propionitrile, dimethyl adipate and the like. As is well known, these different compounds have various different uses, such as solvents, dielectrics, ingredients for polymers.Example 1.
