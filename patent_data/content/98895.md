# Rigid diaphragm transducer with plural coils.

## Abstract
A rigid surface transducer of the electro acoustic type more commonly referred to as an audio speaker. The transducer comprises an improved diaphragm and driver configuration and improved excitation modes. The improved features are accomplished by the combination of a driver 21 comprising at least two pairs of magnets 23 , the magnets of each pair being spaced apart in one direction a first distance to form a first pair of gaps, 45 each pair of gaps being spaced apart in another direction to form a second gap 25 a diaphragm 5 and coil support assembly 1 including a coil support 3 comprising a pair of elongated members 3 spaced apart a distance greater than the second gap 25 a spirally wound coil 7 on an outside face 17 of each of the elongated members 3 , the end of the coils adapted to be coupled to an electrical signal generating means a nonflexible nonplanar diaphragm member 5 mounted between inside faces of the elongated members 3 one of the elongated members being located in each of the pair of first gaps 45 and, the diaphragm being located in the second gap 25 .
