## Abstract
A process for quaternisation of tertiary amines in a reaction medium comprising a water soluble or water dispersible organic compound of MWt 240 which is liquid at the quaternisation reaction temperature, one of the quaternisation reactants having a BPt 200 C and being volatile relative to the other reactants, to permit its removal after the completion of quaternisation to leave a product comprising an intimate mixture of a cationic surfactant and the reaction medium in a weight ratio of 2 1 to 1 50. Preferably the reaction medium is an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant.
