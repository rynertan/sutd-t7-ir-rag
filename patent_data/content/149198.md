# Tamper indicating closure.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic closure 10 for fitment to a container for packaging a product capable of producing internal container pressure, e.g., a carbonated beverage, is disclosed. The closure 10 comprises a top wall 12 and an annular sidewall 14 . A closure thread 20 is provided on the inside surface of the sidewall 14 and is preferably extended to require the user to make two turning motions to achieve removal. Thread 20 cooperates with the container neck thread 42 to achieve fitment of the closure 10 to the container neck 40 . A sealing system 22 adjacent the top wall of the closure provides sealing of the closure to the container. One or more gas venting grooves 26 are provided on the closure for venting of pressurized gas from the container upon loss of the seal when the closure is rotated to remove it from the container. In order to streng then the closure 10 where it is crossed by the groove s 26 , a rigidifying structure 34 is provided at each point of traverse by the vent groove s 26 of the closure thread 20 . The height of the rigidifying structure 34 is less than that of the thread 20 . Stand off protuberances 32 are preferably provided about the lower inside surface 28 of sidewall 14 . A heat shrinkable tamper indicating means 16 is attached to the lowermost edge of the sidewall of the closure 10 . Application of heat to the tamper indicating means 16 causes it to shrink towards the container and to a point of interference with a container flange 48 . The combination of tamper indication means 16 and venting structure 26 enables a closure to be formed with tamperproof properties and compatible resistance to prema ture release from a pressurized container.
