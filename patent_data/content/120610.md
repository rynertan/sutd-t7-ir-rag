## Description
CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATION This invention relates to an improved fungicidal formulation. The control of rice blast disease is of great economic benefit in those countries capable of sustaining a rice crop. Tricyclazole, 5 methyl l,2,4 triazolo 3,4 b benzothiazole, is a systemic fungicide for the control of Piricularia oryzae, the causative organism of rice blast. This compound is disclosed inU.S. Patent Specification No. 4,064,261. The present invention provides a controlled release formulation comprising tricyclazole. This formulation may be applied to the locus of the rice plants and thereby release the active ingredient over an extended period of time. The present formulation has advantages over prior formulations already known in the art. Current coz.mercial tricyclazole formulations, such as aqueous suspensions, granules and wettable powders, when applied to the soil quickly release the active ingredient upon application and therefore do not provide the length of disease protection necessary to protect the rice plants through the leaf blast stage.Further, current formulations, by instantly releasing such a high concentration of active ingredient, can be injurious to young rice plants. The present controlled release formulation overcomes both of these do said vantage by releasing tricyclazole over a long period of time without the initial high concentration of active agent. Therefore, one advantage of the present formulation over existing formulations of tricyclazole is the ability to reduce phytotoxicity for young seedlings of rice. Additionally, the present controlled release formulation requires fewer applications of the active over the length of the leaf blast stage of the growing season, thereby allowing the rice farmer to realize a substantial savings of both time and money. According to the present invention there is provided a controlled release formulation comprising tricyclazole and a polymer having a glass transition temperature of from about 200C to 1000C and containing repeating units derived from at least one acrylic monomer of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 Co alkyl and R2is C1 C10 alkyl said repeating units constituting from about 30 to 100 by weight of the polymer. In the above formula the term C1 C10 alkyl represents a straight or branched alkyl chain having from one to ten carbon atoms. Typical C1 C10 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, t butyl, isopentyl, n hexyl, n heptyl, 2 ethylhexyl, isononyl, n decyl and the like. Preferred monomers have the above formula wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl and R2 is C1 C5 alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl. The term polymer , as used herein, refers to both homo and copolymers. However, it is crucial for success of the invention, that the polymer, be it homo or copolymer, contain repeating units derived from the acrylic monomer s of formula I in an amount of from about 30 to 100 by weight of the polymers. The acrylic polymer s will typically have an average molecular weight of about 500 to 3,000,000, more preferably from about 5000 to 1,000,000. The polymer may be linear, cross linked or metal ion cross linkable. The preparation of these polymers will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry. The polymers employed in the present formulation, in addition to containing from about 30 to 100 by weight of the above defined acrylic repeating units, may also contain repeating units derived from a non acrylic monomer. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the use of non acrylic monomers may be appropriate when a more economical polymer is desired, or when the availability of the acrylic polymers is limited. Examples of such nonacrylic monomers which may be used in the polymer include, but are not limited to, styrene, a methyl styrene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride and the like. Repeating units derived from such other monomers can be present in the polymer at a concentration of up to about 70 by weight of the polymer employed in the formulation of the invention. In addition to having the above noted properties, the polymer employed in the present formulation will have a glass transition temperature Tg in the range of from about 200C to about 100 C, more preferably from about 15 C to 600cue Therefore the amount of non acrylic monomer permissible in the final polymer is limited by the resulting glass transition temperature of the final mixture of monomers as long as the non acrylic monomer is not present Ã…at a concentration greater than 70 by weight. All glass transition values were determined on a DuPonts 990 Thermal Analyzer using glass beads as the reference. The thermocouple was painted with the emulsion, air dried for 24 hours, and dried in vacuo at 250C. for 48 hours. The system was then cooled to 80 C with liquid nitrogen, heated at a rate of IOOC per minute and the glass transition was taken at the first departure from the base line. A preferred aspect of the polymer employed in the controlled release formulation of the invention is that it contains a small amount, for example, up to about 4 by weight, of repeating units derived from an acrylic or methacrylic acid. Typically, the addition of one or more of these acids during polymerization promotes the emulsion polymerization process and thereby yields polymers which form films with improved properties. Several commercially available acrylic copolymers fall within the description of polymers provided herein which can be employed in the present formulation. Preferred among these commercially available acrylic copolymers is Rhoplex AC 33 Rohm andHaas Company . This acrylic resin emulsion has the following properties Appearance White milky liquidSolids content, 46 to 47 pH 9.4 to 9.9Weight per gallon, Ibs. 8.9MinimUm film formation temperature 90C. Tg Glass transition tem 90C. perature The copolymer contains ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate at a ratio of about 2.8 1 w w and approximately 2 3 of acrylic or methacrylic acid. The resin emulsion contains about 5 of an alkyl aryl polyethylene oxide surfactant. The molecular weight of the copolymer is 780,000 T 10 as determined by solution viscosity. Another acrylic copolymer suitable for use in the present controlled release formulation is sold under the trademark Rhoplex B 85 and is also manufactured by Rohm and Haas Co. Typical physical properties of Rhoplex B 85 are as follows Appearance White milky liquidSolids, 38.0 0.5 pH as shipped 9.5 to 10.0Weight per gallon, lbs. 8.9 Dry bulking value gal lb. 0.102 calculated Tukon hardness KIlN 18Colloidal charge AnionicMinimum film formation temperature 900C. Tg 910C. The copolymer was shown to contain greater than 90 of methyl methacrylate by weight. Rhoplex B 60A is yet another acrylic emulsion copolymer manufactured by Rohm and Haas Company which can be used to prepare slow release compositions of the invention. Typical properties of Rhoplex B 60A are as follows Appearance White milky liquidSolids, 46 to 47 pH when packed 9.4 to 9.9Weight per gallon, Ibis. 8.9Minimum film formation temperature 90C.Tg lO0C. The copolymer contained methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate at a ratio of about 2.2 1 w w . The resin emulsion also contained an alkyl aryl polyether alcohol. Acrylocoat is a water dispersible emulsion containing an acrylic copolymer manufactured by Rohm and Haas Company. Certain properties of Acrylocoat are as follows Appearance Opaque, milky liquidSolids Content, 44 by weightFlash Point non flammable pHViscosity, cps 340Specific Gravity 1.05Weight per gallon, lbs. 8.8 The tricyclazole and polymer are preferably formulated with a suitable agriculturally acceptable carrier. The carriers can be adsorptive or absorptive in nature. Typical carriers include limestone, sand, gypsum, ground volcanic rock, clays such as the montmorillonite, attapulgite, kaolin, and ball clays, talc, fertilizer and ground agricultural products such as soybean mill run, corncob grits, rice hulls and the like. Of these, attapulgite clay and ground rice hulls are preferred.Where the granules are prepared by extrusion, ball clays are preferred. Carriers are chosen with regard to their availability and cost. The exact concentrations of tricyclazole and polymer in the present formulations are not critical, so long as the polymer is present in a concentration which is effective to control and delay the release of the tricyclazole into a surrounding locus. Typically, the higher the concentration of polymer in the formu lation, the slower the release rate of tricyclazole into the surrounding medium. Desirable concentrations will also depend upon whether the formulation contains only tricyclazole and polymer, or agriculturallyacceptable carrier as well. In general, formulations of tricyclazole and polymer, without carrier, will desirably contain from about 0.1 to about 75 percent by weight of tricyclazole these and subsequent figures are on a dry weight basis and from about 25 to about 99.5 percent by weight of polymer.Preferred ranges are from about 1 to about 50 percent by weight of tricyclazole and from about 50 to about 99 percent by weight of the polymer. In general, three or more component formulations will desirably contain from about 0.1 to about 30 percent by weight of tricyclazole, from about 10 to about 60 percent of polymer and from about 20 to about 89.9 percent by weight of agriculturally acceptable carrier. Such formulations will preferably contain from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight of tricyclazole, from about 20 to about 40 percent by weight of polymer, and from about 20 to about 79 percent by weight of carrier. The novel controlled release granules of the present invention are preferably prepared in the following manner. The active agent, preferably in finely divided form, is slurried in an aqueous emulsion of a polymer of the above description. Preferably, the finely divided particles of active agent are obtained by milling the technical material by any of several well known techniques, such as milling in a fluid energy mill. In Examples 1 20, below, the particle size of the tricyclazole was such that 99.9 percent passed through a 325 mesh screen. The mixture of active agent and polymeric emulsion may then be combined with a suitable agriculturally acceptable carrier and mixed to uniformity.The resulting formulation must be dried, typically at an elevated temperature, to provide dry controlled release granules suitable for application to the locus for which plant disease control is desired. The aqueous dispersion of polymer and tricyclazole is preferably added to the carrier in a state of agitation, which is readily practiced by known methods and apparatuses. However the carrier can be added to the tricyclazole polymer mixture as well.Suitable types of mixers capable of providing such agitation include a coating pan mixer, cement mixer,Hobart mixer, mini tumbler mixer, ribbon blender or any similar rotary type device. The mixing is typically carried out at ambient temperatures. Once the polymer, tricyclazole and carrier, if present, are admixed thoroughly to uniformity, the admixture is preferably dried at an elevated temperature in order to promote cooleseence of the polymer and thereby form a continuous polymer fit This temperature differs depending on the minimum film forming temperature of the polymer employed The temperature will typically be in the range Of frdm about S C. to 1800C., more preferably in the range from 300C. to 1250C. The type Qf drying apparatus is not critical, but may be chosen from any one of several devices well known to those in the art.Typical driers include rotary type driers, and ovens operated at either standard or reduced pressure. Depending on the polymer, the formulation may also be dried under ambient conditions. Alternatively, the polymer, tricyclazole and an appropriate carrier can be admixed thoroughly to uniformity, as described above, and then extruded and subsequently dried to form pellets or granules.Techniques and equipment for extrusion are well known.It is important that a clay suited to extrusion be used as the carrier for this embodiment of the invention. Ball type clays are generally preferred. However, the exact identity of the clay is not critical and will vary with local availability. It is desirable to use a suitable surface active agent to aid dispersion of the formulated granule in water when a carrier is employed in the formulation which is not readily disseminated through out the aqueous medium. The choice of surface active agent, and amonrit thereof employed, is dictated by the nature of the composition ingredients and by the ability of the agent to facilitate the dispersing of the composition in water. For example, when using rice hulls as the carrier, a surface active agent is required to facilitate dispersion of the composition in water. Suitable surface active agents are dry and may be nonionic, anionic or cationic. Examples of anionic surface active agents include alkyl or aryl sodium sulphonates or sulfonic acids, calcium alkylaryl sulphonates and alkyl alcohol esters of phosphoric acid.The nonionics include ethoxylated alkyl phenols, ethers and alcohols, sorbitan esters and ethoxylated sorbitan esters and ethers. Emulsifiers and adjuvants belong to the group of surface active agents. The most commercially important emulsifiers are primarily anionic and nonionic agents. The surface active agent is generally present in the formulation at a concentration of from about 0.01 to 5 percent on a dry weight basis. It is believed that the present formulation functions by diffusion of the active ingredient through the polymer matrix into the surrounding aqueous medium.However, the precise mechanism by which the controlled release formulation of the present invention functions is not yet known, and the present formulation is not limited by any mode of operation. Preferred slow release compositions of the present invention contain the following percentages and ingredients by dry weight. The values in the paren dleses represent the percentage of ingredients necessary when a higher concentration of the active agent is employed in the formulation.Formulation 1 4 8 Tricyclazole 46 Rhoplex AC 33 50 46 Ground Rice Hulls Formulation 2 4 8 Tricyclazole 46 Rhoplex AC 33 50 46 Attapulgite clayFormulation 3 4 8 Tricyclazole 20 Rhoplex AC 33 76 72 Ground Rice HullsFormulation 4 4 8 Tricyclazole 30 Rhoplex AC 33 66 62 Ground Rice Hulls The formulated granules are applied to the locus of the plants in the manners conventional in agricultural chemistry. The controlled release formulation may be applied by sophisticated mechanical equipment or simply by spreading the formulation by hand. With regard to mechanical equipment, metering applicators are available which can apply accurately measured quantities of granular compositions to the soil surface.The operator of the application equipment need only take care to adjust the equipment to apply an amount of the granular formulation per unit area which supplies the desired application rate of the compound, and to apply the amount uniformly to the locus of the plants to be treated. The present granules are preferably applied to the soil of a standard transplant flat containing rice plants but may also be applied to a flooded rice paddy. To assure optimal disease control when applying the present controlled release formulation to the soil of a transplant flat containing rice seedlings, it is important that the rice be transplanted with a mechanical transplanter. If mechanical transplanting is not possible, transplanting should be done in such a manner that all soil adhering to the roots is transplanted to the field with the rice seedlings. Tricyclazole in the soil adhering to the roots of transplants enters the rice plant to provide continuing blast control throughout the vegetative stage of growth.

A study was also conducted in an effort to demonstrate the sustained release properties of the present formulation. The following procedure was used to illustrate these properties A beaker was filled with. three liters of deionized water at room temperature. The exemplary sustained release granules totaling60 mg. of active agent were added to the water to provide a concentration of 20 ppm. when all of the tricyclazole was released from the granule. At various time intervals after addition, 1 ml. samples of water were taken from the beaker and analyzed to de.enwine the concentration of active agent therein. For some of the formulations evaluated in this study, after the concentration of active agent in water began to stabilize, the water was removed by decanting and the residue on the bottom was allowed to dry. This residue was then analyzed to determine the concentration of active agent remaining. A 759 wettable powder foumulation was also studied for comparison. The results of this study appear below in. Table III as parts per million.
