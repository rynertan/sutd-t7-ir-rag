# Biologically active proteins and a method for their production.

## Abstract
A method for preparing polypeptides in bacteria with an alanine rather than a methionine at the N terminus. The DNA sequence expressed has an alanine codon immediately following from at least one methionine codon, and allows for the expression of polypeptides having the amino acid sequence essentially the same as such naturally occurring eucaryotic protein as various bovine and porcine somatotropin species. In another important embodiment, the invention provides a class of compositions comprising certain valine containing somatropin species which increase milk production in lactating mammals to a significantly greater extent than otherwise identical leucine somatotropin species.

## Claims
1. A composition comprising at least one bGH species containing a valine at or around position 126 wherein the concentration of said species, based on the weight of all bGH in said composition, is substantially greater than the concentration of similarly valine containing species in pooled pituitary bGH.

## Description
This application is a continuation in part of pending U.S. Patent Application serial number 704,362 filed on February 22, 1985. The present invention is directed to a method of expressing heterologous DNA sequences e.g. eucaryotic genes in procaryotic organisms. In one important embodiment, the invention is directed to production in procaryotes of polypeptides having an N terminal alanine and to various N alanyl polypeptides that can be produced by that method. Also included is a class of valine bGH bovine growth hormone species that enhance milk production to an unexpectedly great extent. Expression of genes by eucaryotes and procaryotes, while sharing the same basic steps of gene transcription into messenger RNA mRNA and subsequent translation of that mRNA into proteins, employ different sets of intracellular controls for these steps. Additionally, in eucaryotes many mature proteins are first translated as pre proteins In the event that the DNA sequence encoding the mature protein is used for mature protein expression in procaryotes, this sequence will be lacking the eucaryotic translation and post translation processing signals usually contained within the DNA for the leader sequence. Therefore, for expression of cloned eucaryotic genes or other heterologous DNA sequences in procaryotic systems, it has proven desirable to employ procaryotic control signals for reasons of efficiency and because eucaryotic signals may not be recognized by a procaryotic host cell. The term heterologous DNA is defined herein as DNA at least a portion of which is not normally contained within the genome of the host cell. Examples of heterologous DNA include, but are not limited to, viral and eucaryotic genes, gene fragments, alleles and synthetic DNA sequences. The term heterologous protein or heterologous polypeptide is defined herein as a protein or polypeptide at least a portion of which is not normally encoded within the genome of the host cell. The procaryotic control signals include a promoter which signals the initiation of transcription and translation control signals comprising a ribosome binding site, a translation start signal and a translation stop signal. All of these signals except the translation stop signal must be situated in front of the eucaryotic gene or other DNA to be expressed. The art has adopted several approaches to expressing heterologous DNA e.g. eucaryotic genes in procaryotes. In one approach, the DNA segment encoding the resultant protein is ligated to the DNA encoding all or part of a bacterial protein under the control of its bacterial promoter. The endogenous procaryotic DNA necessarily also contains the ribosome binding site and translation start signal. Expression of such ligated DNA results in what is called a fusion protein comprising the eucaryotic polypeptide linked or fused to a whole or partial bacterial protein. Isolation of the eucaryotic protein may then be achieved by site specific enzymatic or chemical cleavage at the endogenous eucaryotic protein fusion site or by selective degradation of the procaryotic polypeptide sequences. Examples of published works relating to the production in bacteria of eucaryotic fusion proteins include European Application 47,600 published March 17, 1982 which refers to fusion and non fusion proteins comprising bovine pre growth hormone or bovine growth hormone bGH at the carboxy C terminus with or without a portion of a procaryotic protein at the amino N terminus U.K. Patent Application GB 2,073,245A published October 14, 1981 referring to fusion proteins of bGH and Fusion proteins, however, have become an attractive system for expressing some eucaryotic genes or other heterologous DNA in procaryotic cells, as the fusion product appears to protect some of the resulting heterologous proteins from intracellular degradation. Bacterial cells appear to recognize some eucaryotic proteins produced therein as foreign and, thus, proceed to degrade these proteins as soon as the proteins are made or shortly thereafter. Fusion proteins engineered for protective purposes can employ endogenous polypeptide sequences at either the amino or carboxy terminus of the heterologous protein. An example of the latter approach is found in European Patent Application 111,814 published June 27, 1984 describing fusion proteins comprising a form of bGH having a synthetic front end amino terminus and In another approach, the translation start signal, ATG, under the control of a bacterial promoter, is located immediately preceding the DNA sequence encoding a heterologous e.g. eucaryotic protein free from endogenous protein at both the N and C termini of the protein produced. Although the proteins produced by such gene constructs do not require subsequent cleavage to generate the desired protein, they typically include a methionine in some cases a formyl methionine at the N terminus as the ATG start signal is also a methionine codon. Thus, unless the desired mature protein begins with methionine, the protein will now have an N terminus altered by inclusion of that methionine residue. Examples of such gene constructs include Guarente et al., Another example relates to the production of growth hormones in bacteria employing the above described gene construct. Schoner et al. Addition of an N terminal methionine to the natural N terminus may be undesirable for several reasons. First, it is possible although currently believed unlikely that the methionine may tend to make the protein antigenic in an organism in which the protein without the N methionine is endogenous. Second, the addition of methionine to the N terminal portion of the protein may have an undesirable effect on its bioactivity or its physical properties. Third, this altered form of the protein may hinder scientific efforts in determining the relationship of the natural protein s function to its structure. Further, it may be advantageous to have a biosynthetic protein which is structurally as close as possible to a naturally occurring protein when applying for governmental approval of medical or veterinary applications. The ability of such procaryotes as bacteria to remove the N terminal methionine from proteins either during their production or thereafter has been a topic of considerable interest. For example, Waller, There is, thus, a need to develop an economic and predictable means for producing in such microorganisms as bacteria heterologous e.g. eucaryotic proteins that do not have an N terminal methionine. Specifically, it is especially desirable to develop a method whereby such proteins produced in bacteria do not require Growth hormones also called somatotropins are polypeptides produced and secreted by cells of the pituitary gland and are largely species specific in their actions. In addition to their role in promoting skeletal growth, growth hormones affect a variety of metabolic processes including the stimulation of lactation, increased insulin release from the pancreas and glucagon secretion, and they exert a lipid mobilizing effect. Exogenous administration of bGH to cattle, for example, has been demonstrated to increase milk production, feed efficiency and or growth rate, decrease fattening time and increase the lean to fat ratio. It is still not fully understood, however, how the hormone exerts these multiple effects. Extensive work with human growth hormone hGH has established that the hormone, as secreted by the human pituitary gland, is not a single molecular entity but a mixture of polypeptides. Fractionation of the various hGH species has resulted in the preparation of some hGH fractions with neither diabetogenic or lipolytic activities. Similarly, bGH is produced by cattle in multiple forms. Specifically, four forms of bGH are produced which differ at two positions of the protein. The N terminal amino acid can vary due to a presumed ambiguity in removal of the signal peptide leader sequence so that the mature protein begins with either NH₂ phe pro or NH₂ ala phe pro. In addition, there is a heterogeneity at amino acid 126 being either a leucine or a valine. This is apparently due to an allelic variation in the bovine population. Wallis 1969 The bGH A,V and bGH V species are sometimes collectively referred to herein as valine allelic bGH species or valine bGH species . Similarly, the bGH A,L and bGH L species are sometimes collectively referred to herein as leucine allelic bGH species or leucine bGH species . The numbers assigned to the amino acids in the bGH proteins as abbreviated above are for purposes of identification and reference only. Mills et al. 1970 , The entire DNA coding sequences and corresponding amino acid sequences for bGH L and pGH P have been published by Seeburg et al., Pituitary cells of individual cattle have been generally found to contain a mixture of at least bGH A,L and bGH L , or bGH A,V and bGH V . N terminal analysis of bGH proteins produced in cultured pituitary cells shows an approximately 50 50 mixture of molecules containing either an N terminal phenylalanine phe or an N terminal alanine ala . Commercially available preparations, made from pooled pituitaries of many cattle, generally include all four molecular forms of pituitary bGH. Furthermore, it has been reported that about thirty percent of the molecules in bGH preparations obtained from pooled glands have valine replacing leucine at position 126. Ferandez et al. 1971 Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to produce in procaryotes eucaryotic or other heterologous polypeptides which do not have a methionine residue at the N terminus. It is another object of the invention to produce in procaryotes eucaryotic or other heterologous polypeptides that do not require Still another object of the invention is to provide a method for production in procaryotes of eucaryotic or other heterologous polypeptides that have an N terminal alanine without the need for Another object of the invention is to produce in procaryotes eucaryotic or other heterologous polypeptides that have the amino acid sequence essentially the same as a naturally occurring protein which does not have an N terminal methionine. A further object of the invention is to provide a method of producing in procaryotes polypeptides having the amino acid sequence found in mature eucaryotic polypeptides such as bGH A,L , bGH A,V and pGH A . It is a still further object of the invention to provide bGH A,L , bGH A,V or pGH A substantially free of proteins of bovine or porcine origin, respectively. It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a class of bGH species which enhance milk production in cows to an advantageously greater extent. The bGH polypeptides produced by methods of the present invention provide a means for potentiating such somatotropin activities as increased milk production, growth rate and or feed efficiency. These and other objects of the invention will be more fully apparent from the following general and detailed description of the invention. Objects of this invention are achieved, in one embodiment, by a method for bacterially producing a heterologous polypeptide having an N terminal alanine which comprises causing expression of genomic DNA in selected bacteria, said DNA containing from one to about three contiguous methionine codons including a translation start signal, followed immediately by the codons for said polypeptide, followed by a translation stop signal codon, and recovering the resulting heterologous polypeptide having an N terminal alanine produced within said bacteria. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of producing a heterologous polypeptide having an N terminal alanine comprising causing expression of genomic DNA in selected bacteria, said DNA containing a translation start signal methionine codon immediately followed by the codons for said polypeptide, followed by a translation stop signal codon, and recovering the resulting heterologous polypeptide having an N terminal alanine produced within said bacteria. In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for preparing in bacteria a heterologous polypeptide containing an amino acid sequence essentially the same as that of a naturally occurring eucaryotic polypeptide. In other embodiments, the present invention provides various compositions comprising such somatotropins as bGH A,L , bGH A,V , pGH A , and mixtures of bGH A,L and bGH A,V , substantially free of polypeptides of bovine or porcine origin, respectively, or of other somatotropin species. In still another embodiment, it was discovered that compositions comprising a class of valine bGH species enhance milk production in cows to a greater extent than otherwise identical leucine bGH species or bGH A,L . In one preferred embodiment, compositions able to achieve such enhanced milk production, which compositions comprise essentially pure valine bGH species, are provided. Other embodiments include various genes, DNA vectors and transformed bacteria useful in the aforementioned methods, as well as certain methods utilizing the aforementioned compositions for enhancing bovine and or porcine lactation, pre adult growth, and or feed conversion efficiency. In the following diagramatic representations, the hatched box represents the DNA coding sequence for a bacterial promoter, the blackened box represents a heterologous DNA coding sequence, the bars represent additional DNA coding sequences as labeled, and the directional arrow represents the 5 to 3 orientation of the DNA coding sequences. Relevant restriction endonuclease sites are also shown. The DNA regions so marked are for purposes of diagramatic representation only and are not drawn to scale. The present invention provides a method for producing in a procaryote a heterologous polypeptide, such as a eucaryotic e.g. mammalian or avian protein, that has an N terminal alanine. Thus the polypeptide is produced without an N terminal methionine, and the need for The present invention provides a valuable method for production of essentially pure proteins that have an N terminal alanine. Such proteins include, without limitation, given species of bovine and porcine somatotropin and variants thereof, the plant proteins ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit, glutathione S tranferase, and heat shock protein 70. The invention is also useful for the production of other polypeptides where it is desirable to have an alanine at the N terminus rather than a methionine. It can be desirable to have an N terminal alanine rather than an N terminal methionine because, inter alia, the N alanyl form of the polypeptide may be less immunogenic, or have different physical properties or a modified bioactivity. In the examples of the present invention wherein essentially pure species of bGH or pGH are produced by bacterial cells, evidence and teachings for removal of the N terminal methionine are clearly lacking. Indeed, all reports of bGH expression by bacterial cells wherein the N terminus comprises an N terminal amino acid sequence homologous to naturally occurring bGH species report the presence of an N terminal methionine. In Seeburg et al., As detailed in the examples of the present invention, my approach to bGH A,L , bGH A,V and pGH A production in bacteria was briefly as follows. The DNA coding sequences for the aforementioned proteins were constructed by oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagenesis of the DNA coding sequences for bovine and porcine somatotropin species containing an N terminal phenylalanine as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 8. Thereafter, the bGH A,L , bGH A,V and pGH A coding sequences were inserted into expression vectors such that the final gene sequence comprised, sequentially, a promoter, a ribosome binding site, an ATG start methionine codon immediately adjacent the DNA coding sequence for either bGH A,L , bGH A,V or pGH A , and a translation stop codon. Thus, it has been discovered here that when a DNA sequence containing a start signal methionine codon followed immediately by the codons for a heterologous N alanyl polypeptide is expressed, the protein recovered from the procaryotic organism actually has alanine at the N terminus, not a methionine. It is believed that a similar result is obtainable when that alanine codon is immediately preceded by up to about three contiguous methionine codons which include the start signal for translation of the mRNA encoding the desired polypeptide product. For example, the DNA including that translation start signal and the codons for the desired polypeptide product can include any sequence appropriately coding for met ala, met met ala, met met met ala, or any functional equivalent thereof. An N alanyl polypeptide is herein defined as a polypeptide having an alanine at its amino terminus. While applicant does not wish to be bound by the following theory of mechanism, it is believed that subsequent to translation, the N terminal methionine of the polypeptide is enzymatically removed by the procaryote if the next amino acid is alanine or another amino acid having similar characteristics e.g. polarity or hydrophobicity that facilitate such removal of the N methionine. It is furthermore believed that many procaryotes are capable of removing N terminal methionines from heterologous and or endogenous polypeptides when said N terminal methionines are immediately followed by an alanine. These procaryotes e.g. various bacteria known and publicly available through recognized microorganism depositor institutions such as the ATCC or otherwise include but are believed not limited to In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, three different isolates of The present discovery is significant since it provides a method of producing in procaryotes heterologous polypeptides that have N terminal alanines. In one of the preferred embodiments, the method of the present invention is employed to generate two bGH species, bGH A,L and bGH A,V , and one pGH species, pGH A , free from other bovine or porcine proteins and or other bGH or pGH species, respectively. Specifically, the method provides for production of bGH A,L , bGH A,V or pGH A as single species. The ability to produce a single bGH or pGH species with amino acid sequences homologous to naturally occurring somatotropins has tremendous import for determining the precise bioreactivity of each bGH or pGH species given the numerous potentiating effects of bGH and pGH generally as cited above. In fact, it has been found that administering either of the two N alanyl bGH species yields a potentiation of such bGH functions as milk production. Further, it has been found that administration of a lactation enhancing amount of bGH A,V produced in accordance with the present invention increases milk production in dairy cows to a statistically e.g. p 0.05 greater extent than similarly produced bGH A,L . To date, there has been no teaching of the relative effectiveness of specific bGH forms species in enhancing milk production in lactating mammals. Furthermore, there has been no prior result, Additionally, once the bioactivity of each naturally occurring species is determined, it is considered feasible to generate polypeptide variants of each of such species which would further increase their somatotropin activity. It is, therefore, anticipated that the generation of somatotropin variants by nucleotide or amino acid deletion, substitution and or addition will provide various useful equivalents of the compositions disclosed herein. Such variants include an altered form of bGH V wherein the alteration comprises the addition of a methionine to the amino terminus. This variant, produced by genetically transformed bacteria, has also been found to increase lactation in dairy cows to a surprisingly great extent when administered in a lactation enhancing amount. Furthermore, the extent of the observed increase in lactation pursuant to administration of this bGH V variant was found to be measurably greater than the lactation enhancement observed pursuant to administration of an otherwise identical variant containing leucine at amino acid position 126. While applicant does not wish to be bound by the following theory of mechanism, it appears that the substitution of valine for leucine at position 126 significantly enhances the bioavailability and or bioreactivity of such somatrotropin protein s . Specifically, x ray crystallography performed on somatotropin proteins indicates that the region of said proteins from about amino acid 90 to about amino acid 135 constitutes a relatively flexible region. Studies of other proteins have shown that flexible regions often comprise a bioreactive site e.g. a site which interacts with biologic receptors and or other portions of the same protein to achieve a bioactive form . Thus, it is anticipated that additional variants of bGH A,V ,which variants comprise amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions and or inversions within this described flexible region and or outside this region that likewise result in a measurable enhancement of lactation e.g. milk production to a greater extent than otherwise identical leucine bGH species or bGH A,L , can be made. For example, changes at or around amino acid position 126 can include a substitution of other more hydrophilic and or smaller amino acids relative to leucine providing that the described enhancement in milk production is not diminished to an intolerable degree. Further, it is anticipated that valine bGH species containing an N terminal phe₁, or an N terminal ala In one of its broadest embodiments, the present invention is a refinement in the use of a recombinant DNA technology to directly produce in procaryotes heterologous polypeptides. Thus, the description of the invention presupposes knowledge of the basic techniques employed in recombinant DNA technology to isolate and clone DNA sequences encoding polypeptides, the rearrangement or altering of cloned DNA sequences, and the expression of cloned or modified DNA sequences in transformed microorganisms. Such techniques are within the skill of the art. In one embodiment of the present invention, the DNA sequence coding for the desired heterologous polypeptide to be produced in the procaryote is chosen and isolated, or a DNA sequence that encodes it is constructed or chemically synthesized. In many important embodiments, the polypeptide is a eucaryotic protein. If the polypeptide is small and the complete amino acid sequence known, a synthetic DNA molecule or sequence encoding the polypeptide can be constructed. If the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is unknown, or its size is too large for the synthesis of a corresponding DNA sequence to be practical, a cDNA sequence can be prepared by reverse transcription from corresponding mRNA obtained from tissues or cells expressing the polypeptide. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the sequence for bGH can be so obtained from bovine pituitaries by now routine procedures described by Goodman et al. Once a heterologous DNA sequence containing the codons for the desired polypeptide is obtained, it may be desirable to make certain modifications in the nucleotide sequence of the molecule. For example, if the molecule has been produced by reverse transcription from an mRNA template, it will often contain at least a portion of the DNA encoding the leader sequence of the pre protein. Thus, it is necessary to remove all of the leader sequence DNA prior to the first codon of the desired protein. In some cases it may be necessary to add or substitute an alanine codon at the beginning of the sequence encoding the desired protein if it does not already have an N terminal alanine codon. Then a translation start signal which is also a methionine codon is introduced upstream and immediately adjacent to the alanine codon. While the start signal methionine codon will usually and preferably be the nucleotide sequence ATG, the sequence GTG can also occasionally serve as a start initiation signal methionine codon. Additionally, the presence of more than one methionine codon, e.g. two, three or possibly more contiguous codons for methionine, is understood to constitute equivalence within the method of the present invention. If not already present, at least one translation stop signal should be introduced after the codon for the C terminal amino acid. Examples of translation stop signals include the deoxynucleotide triplets TAA, TGA, and TAG. In essence, therefore, recombinant DNA techniques are applied to construct a recombinant DNA sequence containing, sequentially, a translation start signal methionine codon, the codons for the desired polypeptide with the N terminal alanine codon adjacent to the start signal, and at least one translation stop signal adjacent to the codon for the C terminal amino acid. It has been found that efficient expression of mRNA can be hindered by secondary structures formed by the hydrogen bonding of two complementary series of nucleotides within the mRNA. Elimination of these complementary sequences, particularly in that portion of the molecule that encodes the N terminus, facilitates the binding of ribosomes to the mRNA and, therefore, increased levels of expression. It may be desirable, therefore, to replace codons that participate in the formation of such secondary structures with codons for the same amino acid, but comprised of a different nucleotide triplet. Other approaches to constructing the heterologous DNA sequences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, if a DNA molecule is available that encodes a polypeptide which is expressed with an N terminal structure of NH2 met x y... where x is an amino acid other than alanine, an alanine codon can be inserted between the translation start signal methionine codon and the codon for x. Alternately, the codon for x may be deleted and an alanine codon inserted in place thereof. Thus, a protein having the N terminal structure NH2 ala x y... or NH2 ala y..., respectively, would be produced in the process of the present invention. Similarly, deletions, additions and or substitutions in any of the amino acid codons within a given gene sequence may be made so that a variant polypeptide would be expressed in the process of the present invention. A variant polypeptide is defined herein as having single or multiple amino acid deletions, substitutions and or additions as compared to the naturally occurring amino acid sequence of a given polypeptide. Examples of such variants include but are not limited to met bGH L and met bGH V wherein the amino acid sequence of these variant bGH species are identical to the bGH L and bGH V , respectively, produced by bovine pituitary cells except for the presence of an additional methionine at the N terminus. These variant polypeptides are construed as having an amino acid sequence essentially the same as that of a naturally occurring polypeptide as long as the biologic activity is not diminished to an intolerable degree. Creation and expression of variant polypeptides may be desirable in order to achieve increased accumulation, increased protein stability, to facilitate polypeptide purification, and or in optimizing biological activity. The above modifications of the DNA molecule encoding the desired polypeptide can be accomplished using restriction enzymes, exonucleases, endonucleases, etc. by techniques known in the art. The general techniques of oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagenesis can also be employed to effect the above modifications in the structure or sequence of the DNA molecule and are known to those of skill in the art. In accordance with recombinant DNA techniques, once the desired heterologous DNA sequence is obtained, the sequence is then inserted into an appropriate cloning vector which provides a means for replicating the DNA sequence. Any appropriate cloning vector, preferably containing a marker function, may be used, for example Once multiple copies of the desired heterologous DNA sequence are obtained, these sequences may be removed from the recombinant vectors and inserted into an expression system for production and isolation of the desired heterologous protein as described more fully below. Modifications of the heterologous DNA sequence, by methods known to those skilled in the art may be made prior to insertion of these DNA sequences into an expression vector or following said insertion. In the examples of the present invention, M13mp8, described by Messing et al., The marker function employed in the M13 vectors, as described by Messing et al., In a preferred embodiment, bGH L and pGH P DNA coding sequences carried on bacterial plasmids pBGH Once isolated, the ssDNA s of these recombinant vectors were modified by oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagenesis to create the DNA coding sequences for bGH A,V , bGH A,L , bGH V and pGH A . Specifically, bGH L was modified to add a codon for alanine, The bGH A,V coding sequence was created by oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagenesis of the bGH A,L coding sequence as shown in Fig. 4, by converting the leucine codon at amino acid position 127 in bGH A,L to a valine codon, e.g. GTG. It is again anticipated that any codon for valine may be employed in this conversion. The creation of a bGH A,V coding sequence was again confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the resultant bGH A,V coding sequence. The bGH V coding sequence which results in production of met bGH V proteins in bacteria transfected with an expression vector comprising the bGH V coding sequence was similarly created by oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagenesis of the bGH L coding sequence by converting the leucine codon at amino acid position 126 in bGH L to a valine codon, e.g. GTG. The creation of a pGH A coding sequence by oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagenesis of the pGH P coding sequence was similarly performed as shown in Fig. 8 and described more fully below, and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Having now isolated and constructed the desired heterologous DNA sequences, as exemplified for bGH A,L , bGH A,V and pGH A , these sequences may be replicated and numerous copy numbers generated by propagation of the respective recombinant vectors by methods known to those skilled in the art and referenced above. These heterologous DNA sequences may not be inserted into any appropriate expression vector for production in procaryotes of the desired heterologous polypeptides. As discussed previously, an appropriate expression vector should contain the necessary transcription and translation signals for production of a heterologous protein in the chosen host cell along with a marker function for identification of those expression vectors into which the desired heterologous DNA sequence has been inserted. By use of a procaryotic expression vector, the recombinant DNA sequences can be added to the genetic complement of a procaryotic organism via transduction, transformation or transfection collectively referred to herein as transfection and said organism can then be cultured under conditions generally governed by the promoter and host employed that cause the desired polypeptide to be produced. Thus the genomic DNA of the organisms used in this invention contain both chromosomal and episomal DNA. A number of expression vectors have been described for heterologous gene expression and heterologous protein production in procaryotic host cells and are known to those skilled in the art. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, expression vectors pBGH The bGH In the examples of the present invention, expression vectors pMON3209 and pMON3215 comprising pBGH In an example of the present invention, pBGH Production of bGH A,L , bGH A,V or pGH A in Purification of the heterologous peptide produced will depend on both the protein and host cell chosen. It has been observed, for example, that the heterologous proteins produced in such bacteria as It has been found that usually at least about 80 of the heterologous peptide expressed by the method of this invention has an N terminal structure of NH₂ ala... . The remaining polypeptide is typically in the methionyl form, having an N terminal structure of NH2 met ala... . By varying growth conditions and or timing of the induction of gene expression, however, it is possible to raise the proportion of polypeptide with alanine at the N terminal to at least about 95 or even greater. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the somatotropin polypeptide species produced and isolated as described above were shown to exhibit somatotropin like biological activity as assayed in the rabbit liver receptor assay performed as described by Tsushima and Friesen, Use of the N alanine bGH products of this invention increases milk production by cows and are believed to decrease the amount of feed required for a given output of milk by such cows. Administration to dairy cows of a lactation enhancing amount of bGH species containing a valine at or around position 126 of the mature bGH protein is particularly well suited for potentiating milk production by these cows. Such products of this invention may be administered to cows by injection, infusion or implantation in polymers or other media known to achieve the delivery of a required dosage in the circulatory system. Pharmaceutically acceptable base formulations such as solutions, emulsions or gels may be used, either encapsulated or not. These formulations may contain a single bGH species or variant thereof or any prescribed combination of naturally occurring and or variant polypeptides e.g. a mixture of bGH A,V and bGH A,L and or a mixture of bGH A,V and met bGH A . Dosages may range from at least about 0.005 mg to about 200 mg per animal per day and preferably from about 5 mg to about 40 mg per animal per day. The amount most effective for increasing milk production and or feed to milk efficiency may be determined by routine experimentation. The actual preferred dosage of bGH is dependent on such variables as the size, general health and nutritional status of the specific animal. Although milk production can be used to assess the effect of bGH on cows, other production properties of the cows, such as overall growth rate and meat production can also be employed. bGH can, if desired, be administered to cows with other beneficial agents such as other biologically active proteins, antigens, or the like, and thereby provide enhanced effects. As previously discussed, the invention also contemplates the production of variants of bGH which have an N terminal alanine but which have deletions, additions, inversions and or substitutions along the polypeptide chain. Such modifications having desirable lactation and or growth enhancing properties can be identified by routine testing in cows.

Specifically, the template was M13mp8 BGH Oligonucleotide site specific mutagenesis was similarly employed to add an alanine codon to the pGH P DNA coding sequence described by Seeburg et al., The 590 base pair pGH P DNA coding sequence carried on the pPGH The M13mp9 PGH This example demonstrates the construction and expression of three recombinant expression vectors which provide for the direct production in bacteria of poly peptides containing an N terminal alanine. The three polypeptides so produced are the somatotropin species bGH A,L , bGH A,V and pGH A . This example also demonstrates the construction and expression of bGH V and expression of bGH L . The polypeptides so produced are met bGH V and met bGH L , respectively. The bGH A,L , bGH A,V and bGH V DNA coding sequences carried on recombinant vectors M13mp8 BGH Single colonies of Bacteria carrying the expression plasmids pMON3209, pMON3214, pBGH As shown in FIG. 10, the pGH A coding sequence carried on the recombinant vector M13mp9 PGH Expression of the pGH A DNA coding sequence and production of pGH A in This example was performed in order to determine the N terminal amino acid sequence of the heterologous proteins, bGH A,L , bGH A,V , met bGH V , met bGH L and pGH A , produced in bacteria as examples of the method of the present invention. The somatotropin polypeptides produced in Proteins purified by immunoaffinity chromatography for use in N terminal sequence analysis were dialyzed exhaustively against water and then lyophilized. Prior to N terminal sequence analysis, the purified proteins were resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate buffer comprising 50mM ammonium bicarbonate plus 0.1 w v SDS and dialyzed against the same buffer to remove residual tris hydroxymethyl amino methane tris and glycine. An Applied Biosystems Protein Sequencer Model 470A Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster City, CA was then employed for all N terminal sequencing analysis, as described by Hunkapiller et al. 1983 , Table 2, below, shows the results of the sequence analysis for several preparations of bGH A,L , bGH A,V , met bGH V , met bGH L and pGH A polypeptides. The amount of protein with N terminal methionine is shown in the table as a percentage of the total somatotropin in the sample. Two methods were used for methionine quantification. With the indirect method the amount of NH2 met ala phe... in a predominantly NH2 ala phe.. population was calculated from differences in lag signals. Since this procedure depends on an estimate of normal sequence lag, which varies from cycle to cycle, it is only a crude estimate of the NH2 ala phe... sequence present. The direct method comprising an Edman degradation reaction compared signal strength of PTH met to PTH ala after separation of PTH met from chemical noise by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . PTH refers to phenyl thiohydantoin. Specifically, the Edman degradation sequencing reaction consists of reacting the N terminal amino acid with a reagent that causes cleavage of that amino acid and its subsequent release as PTH derivative of that amino acid. The latter procedure will give good estimates of met ala phe... as long as free amino acid contamination is low. As shown by the N terminal sequencing results presented in Table 2, below, no evidence for methionine processing is seen when the N terminal methionine is followed by phenylalanine. However, 80 or more of the molecules produced from the MBS A,L and MBS A,V gene constructs have alanine rather than methionine at the N terminal. The extent of N terminal methionine processing is variable in cells from different fermentation runs, but always occurs in at least 80 of the somatotropin molecules. Additionally, production levels of approximately 10 to 15 of the total bacterial protein were achieved for the somatotropins produced in the transformed microorganisms. This example was performed in order to determine the ability of the bGH species produced in bacteria to stimulate milk production in dairy cows. As shown in Table 3 below, both bGH A,V and met bGH V unexpectedly stimulated milk production to a greater extent than their respective leucine containing analogues, bGH A,L and met bGH L . Additionally, the valine bGH species tested when compared collectively against the leucine bGH species tested showed a statistically p .02 greater enhancement of milk production. The study was conducted briefly as follows. Holstein cows in their second and third trimester of lactation were given 5 milliliters ml sodium bicarbonate solution, pH 9.8 .5, alone herein referred to as control sample or containing about 25 milligrams mg of bGH A,V , bGH A,L , met bGH V or met bGH L herein collectively referred to as test somatotropins , daily. All test somatotropins and control samples were administered parenterally by intramuscular injection into the semitendinosus muscle daily for 21 consecutive days. The individual milk production of each cow was recorded at each PM and AM milking beginning six days prior to the first daily injection through day 21 of injection. Milk fat, protein and somatic cells were anlayzed weekly by the DHIA Test Laboratory at DHIA Testing Center, Springfield, Missouri, 65803. The results presented in Table 3, below indicate that the increase in milk production resulting from administration of bGH A,V to cows was about 50 greater than that obtained using bGH A,L , and about 17 greater for met bGH V as compared to met bGH L . Such unexpected productivity advantages provided by the valine bGH species of this invention are clearly of very great potential economic benefit to dairymen.
