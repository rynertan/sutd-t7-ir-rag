# Cementiferous compositions.

## Abstract
This invention provides plasticiser additive composi tions, for use in cement compositions, which enhance the early gain of compressive strength. The plasticiser additive compositions comprise an aqueous solution of a copolymer or salt thereof, comprising an ethylenically unsaturated monomer having a hydroxyl functional group and an accelerator additive.
