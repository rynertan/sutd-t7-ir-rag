# Process for separating saturated fatty acids.

## Abstract
Saturated fatty acids differing in chain length by at least two carbon atoms can be separated by contacting a feed mixture containing the acids at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent comprising a crystalline silica having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 1, thereby selectively adsorbing the longer chain saturated fatty acid. The remain der of the feed mixture is then removed from the adsorbent, and the selectively adsorbed acid recovered from the adsorbent by desorption at desorption conditions with a desorbent liquid soluble in the feed mixture and having a polarity index of at least 3.5.
