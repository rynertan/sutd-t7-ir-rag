# HIGH RESOLUTION LASER PRINTER

## Abstract
A high resolution laser printer utilizes a first cylindrical lens to focus a laser beam in the sagittal direction prior to the facets of a rotating polygon. The light reflected from the polygon is focused in the horizontal direction at the photo conductor drum of an electrophotographic process by a scan lens assembly. Following the scan lens assembly, there is a second cylindrical lens which also focuses the laser beam in the horizontal direction at the photoconductor The first and second cylindrical lenses are positioned to eliminate errors in the facets of the polygon. Scan speed errors are corrected by storing correction information in a memory and using this information to vary the rate at which the laser is modulated with data.
