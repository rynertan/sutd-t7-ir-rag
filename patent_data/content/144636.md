# A programmable oscillator with power down feature and frequency adjustment.

## Abstract
A programmable oscillator 18 is provided for use on an integrated circuit chip. The oscillator 18 includes a plurality of inverted delay stages 80, 82, ... connected in tandem between an input INPUT and an output node Z . A single FET device 39 couples a common node X to a ground potential. Another FET device 31 controls the control node G. When a logic enabling signal is appropriately applied to the FET devices, the oscillator 18 is controlled so that internal nodes G, H, ... of the oscillator float high when it is off and no energy is dissipated. In addition, the ratio of delays between the delay stages 80, 82, ... and the input stage 92 of the load 37 is such that the load 37 supplies the greater ratio of delays. This ensures that the oscillator s frequency of oscillation tracks the switching speed of the load 37 .
