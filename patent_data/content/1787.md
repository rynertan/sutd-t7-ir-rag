## Abstract
A process for separating hydroxylamine from an aqueous solution containing hydroxylammonium salts in mixture with salts of predominantly monovalent cations whose corresponding free bases have base dissociation constants greater than 10 ⁷. Said solution is passed through a bed of cation exchange resin loaded predominantly with monovalent cations whereby hydroxylammonium and the other cations in solution substantially displace said cations from the resin. A second aqueous solution containing a monovalent amine or hydroxide base of a least 0.5 molar concentration having a dissociation constant greater than 10 ⁷ is passed through the resin bed whereby hydroxylamine is preferentially released to the solution and the resin is correspondingly loaded with the cation of said base. Hydroxylammonium salts can be crystallized from the solution after addition of a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid.

## Description
HYDROXYLAMINE PURIFICATION VIA CATION EXCHANGE. This invention relates to a process of separating hydroxylamine from accompanying impurities in an aqueous sys ten. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hydroxylamine is prepared commercially by theRaschig process or variations thereof in which ammonium or sodium nitrite are reacted in aqueous solution with ammonium or sodium bi sulfite and sulfur dioxide and the resulting disulfonate salts are subsequently hydrolyzed to a solution containing essentially hydroxylammonium sulfate, sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate and or sodium sulfate plus minor amounts of the corresponding nitrates. This solution can be used, after neutralization with ammonia, as a source of hydroxylamine, e.g. for the synthesis of oximes from ketones. However, there is no simple method for isolating pure hydroxylamine or pure hydroxylammonium salts from the mixture. One method for obtaining pure hydroxylammonium salts consists of utilizing the hydroxylammonium containing mixture to synthesize an oxime from a ketone, separating the oxime from the spent solution and hydrolyzing this oxime with a strong mineral acid to recover hydroxylammonium salt and the ketone which can be recycled. This method uses long periods of heating for the hydrolysis and requires expensive equipment for the separation of the oxime from the spent solution and of the hydroxylammonium salt from the ketone.Moreover, salts of hydroxylamine with weak or oxidizing acids cannot be prepared by this method because these acids either do not effect hydrolysis of oximes or decompose the hydroxylammonium salt formed during hydrolysis. Salts of such acids can be prepared by neutralizing cold solutions of hydroxylamine with the corresponding acid. Heinz Holzapfel in Z. Anorg. und Allgem. Chemie,Vol. 288, page 28 195o describes the preparation of roxyla r hydroxylammonium salts by employing an a ange resin in the OH form. This publication does net relate te the separation of hydroxylamine from solutions containing other cations. As disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,508,864 issued April 28, 1970 to Wallace T.Thompson et al., hydroxylammonium perchiorate can be produced either by liberating hydroxylamine from a hydroxylammonium salt by passage through an anion exchange resin and neutralizing with perchloric acid, or by absorbiny hydroxylammonium ion on a cation exchange resin and then passing perchloric acid through the resin. This method does not separate hydroxyl ine from other cations. A cation exchange method is escribed by Earl J. Wheelwright in Industrial EngineeringChemistry Process Design Development, Vol. 16 No. 2 l977 , page 220 for the preparation of hydroxylammonium nitrate.Tnis method does not separate hydroxylamine from other cations and moreover the resulting solution of hydroxyl ammonium nitrate contains significant amounts of nitric acid. While the prior art describes methods for the preparation of hydroxylamine and hydroxylammonium salts, there is a need for a simple and inexpensive process for separating hydroxylamine from solutions containing salts of other cations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have found that when an aqueous solution of hydroxylammonium salts in mixture with salts of other mono valet cations is passed through a cation exchange resin loaded with.monovalent cations, hydroxylammonium ions and the other cations in the solution are absorbed by the resin. When an aqueous solution of a base with dissociation constant greater than 10 7 is passed through the resin, r ydrcxylamine is preferentially released to solution.Hydroxylammonium salts can be crystallized from the solution after addition of a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid. in an embodiment of the invention, a solution containing hydroxylammonium sulfate and nitrate, ammonium sulfate and nitrate and sulfuric acid is passed through a sulfonic acid resin loaded with ammonium ions. Hydroxylammonium ions and protons are loaded on the resin by displacing some of the ammonium ions. An aqueous solution of ammonia is then passed through the resin which releases hydroxylamine to the solution while at the same time the resin is loaded with ammonium ions. Hydroxylamine sulfate is isolated by neutralizing the hydroxylamine solution with sulfuric acid, optionally after first removing by evaporation small amounts of ammonia which may be present. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention effects the isolation of hydroxylamine from aqueous solutions containing hydroxylammonium salts in mixture with salts of other cations by means of cation exchange. In a narrower embodiment this invention effects the isolation of hydroxylamine from aqueous solutions containing essentially hydroxylammonium sulfate, ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid, such as are obtained by the Raschig synthesis of hydroxylamine. For the isolation of hydroxylamine by cation exchange, advantage is taken of the relatively weak basicity of hydroxylamine, which has a base dissociation constant of about l X l08 at ambient temperature. At pH below about 4, such as exists in the technical mixtures resulting from theRaschig process, hydroxylamine is fully converted to hydroxylammonium ion and competes on about equal terms with other monovalent cations for the exchange sites of a cation exchange resin. Therefore, when such a solution is passed through a cation exchange resin loaded with other monovalent ions hydroxylammonium ion can displace these ions. Polyvalent cations on the other hand have generally higher affinities for the exchange sites of the resin and are more difficult to displace by hydroxylammonium ions although mass action effects can still be applied.For this reason the present invention is ordinarily applied to the separation of hydroxylamine from solutions containing polyvalent cations in equivalent amounts less than about 10 of the equivalents of hydroxylammonium ion present in solution. Anions present ln si r do not occupy exchange sites on the cation exchange resent therefore the nature of said anions is not of importance to the process of the present invention. Initially the cation exchange resin bed can be loaded with monovalent cations such as those present in the feed solutions containing hydroxylamine. After hydroxylammonium ion has been loaded or fed onto the resin it is important to wash the resin with water in order to remove anions and also excess cations which do not occupy resin exchange sites. An aqueous solution of a monovalent base stronger than hydroxylamine, e.g. with a base dissociation constant of at least 10 7, is then passed through the resin and displaces hydroxylamine. If a cation whose correspond ing base has dissociation constant less than lO 7 is loaded on the resin, this cation will also be largely displaced by the base used to displace hydroxylamine. For this reason such cations cannot be effectively separated from hydroxylamine by the present invention.The aqueous solution of hydroxylamine obtained may be used as a source of hydroxylamine without further treatment, or it may be neutralized with an acid and the corresponding hydroxylammonium salt isolated. For the method of the present invention all types of cation exchange resins are suitable, e.g. sulfonic, phosphonic or carboxylic types. Sulfonic resins are preferred because they have a very low affinity for protons and consequently it is possible to use directly as feed the relatively strongly acidic technical solutions available through the Raschig process. If a carboxylic or phosphonic resin is used it is generally desirable to neutralize the feed. solution to pH about 4 otherwise protons take precedence over hydroxylammonium ions in occupying resin exchange sites. For displacing hydroxylamine from the resin, any water soluble monovalent amine or hydroxide base with a base dissociation constant of at least lO 7 can be used. Poly valont bases are less suitable because their cations have great affinity for the exchange sites of the resin and therefore cannot be readily displaced by hydroxylammonium ion in a subsequent loading cycle. Suitable bases are for example, sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like amine, ethylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine and tr The preferred base is ammonia which has the advantages Cf being relatively inexpensive, non toxic, of low molecular weight and volatile. Moreover, the by product obtained wn ammonia is used as a base for the recovery of hydroxylami from a mixture of sulfate salts is ammonium sulfate, which is valuable as a fertilizer. The volatility of ammonia also allows the use of slight excess of ammonia in order to displace hydroxylamin completely from the resin because small amounts of ammon that will contaminate the product hydroxylamine during t operation can easily be removed by evaporation. TC ha found, however, that it is possible to obtain essential ammonia free hydroxylamine solutions directly from the re...by using a deficient amount of ammonia to displace hydrox amine. The aqueous base solution which is used to remo hydroxylamine from the ion exchange resin during take unl ing step may optionally contain hydroxylamine. In tha case, the eluent which is thereafter finally obtained b quently washing the resin bed with water, contains hydroxy amine at a concentration which is substantially higher t . the concentration obtained if no hydroxylamine were prese in said aqueous base solution. This effect allows the recovery of relatively concentrated hydroxylamine liquors a cyclic process by simply recycling part of the hydroxyl amine product solution to the unloading step of the nex. cycle after mixing with a base. The present invention is applicable within widel varying process parameters, although limitations of a prac tical nature exist. The hydroxylammonium ion concentratlc in the mixture from which it is desired to isolate hydroxy aminc is of little consequence. Concentrations fror 10 up to saturation may be employed. Of higher importance i the mole fraction of hydroxylammonium cation relative tC t other cations in the mixture because all cations compete for resin exchange sites.Although it is possible to retain small amounts of hydroxylammonium ion from mixtures containing a very small mole fraction thereof, for practical purposes it is desirable to have mole fractions of hydroxylammonium ion greater than 0.05 and preferably greater than 0.10. The concentration of the aqueous base used to displace hydroxylamine from the resin is not critical, however, concentrations higher than 0.5 molar and preferably higher than l molar are used in order to obtain relatively concentrated solutions of hydroxylamine. The process of the present invention can be practiced at any temperature between the freezing point and the boiling point of the solutions used. A preferred range is between about 250C and 800C, and more preferred is a range between about 350C and 650C. The application of this invention is further described for a preferred embodiment of the process, i.e. the isolation of hydroxylamine from a mixture of hydroxylammonium and ammonium sulfates and sulfuric acid obtained by theRaschig process using an ammonium sulfonate resin. Reaction l represents the displacement of the ammonium ion by hydroxylammonium ion during the loading operation. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is about 0.8 to 1.3.Reaction 2 represents the displacement of the ammonium ion by proton during loading. This is an undesirable reaction, however the equilibrium constant is only about 0.25. During loading there is also displacement of ammonium ions from the resin by ammonium ions in the solution but this reaction has no net effect. Reaction 3 represents the displacement of hydroxylamine by ammonia when aqueous ammonia is passed through the loaded resin. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is approximately equal to the ratio of the base dissociation constant of ammonia to the base dissociation constant of hydroxylamine multiplied by the equilibrium constant of reaction l , therefore it is about 2,000. It can be seen that displacement of hydroxylamine by ammonia is a very favorable reaction.Reaction 4 represents the neutralization of free sulfonic acid sites that takes place when aqueous ammonia is passed through the loaded resin.This is essentially a non reversible reaction and takes precedence over reaction 3 . 1 RSO3NH4 1 2 NH3OH 2SO4 RSO3NH3OH 1 2 NH4 2SO4 resin resin 2 RSO3NH4 1 2 H2SO4 RS03H 1 2 NH4 2S04 resin resin 3 RSO3NH3OH NH3 RSO3NH4 NH2OH resin resin 4 RSO3H H3 RSO3NH4 resin resin The appl nt ionic selectivity of a sulfonic acid ion exchange resin or hydroxylamine versus ammonia is governed by the pH f the solution. At pH below about 4 both hydroxylamine .nd ammonia are fully protonated and compete on about equal terms for the resin ion exchange sites according to cation 1 .Accordingly, such pH is preferred in the present process. Feeding of the resin at pH below about 4 res lts in hydroxylammonium ion replacing ammonium ions from t resin with the greatest efficiency possible. At pH above about 4 some of the hydroxylamine remains as uncharged ee base to an extent which can be calculated using the se dissociation constant of hydroxylamine which is about 7 10 8 at 250C at the ionic strength of the technical mixtu resulting from the Raschig pro cess. To the extent th hydroxylamine is uncharged it foes not compete with ammonium ions for resin ion exchange sites resulting in a decrease the the apparent selectivity of the resin for hydroxylamine sus ammonia. However, the uncharged hydroxylamine enter the aqueous phase con tained in the gel structu . of the resin to a much greater extent than ammonium or hy oxylammonium ions which are excluded because of the Do an exclusion principle. The net result is that while at pH low about 4 the only process by which hydroxylamine is take. ip on the resin is ion exchange, at higher pH values the effi ency of the ion exchange process decreases and at the me time some of the unchanged hydroxylainine is held within , gel volume of the resin bed. The shift away from ion hange is gradual and does n become significant until pH about 5 or higher.At about pH 7, the ion exchange process becomes only marginally er tective for purification of hydroxylamine and a pH below .Dout 5 is preferred for the solution fed into the cation exchange resin bed. The apparent ionic selectivity of an acid resin for hydroxylamine versus ammonia can be determined by allowing the resin to equilibrate with a solution of hydroxylammonium and ammonium salts at a given pH and determining the composition of the solution and of the resin cutter first washing the resin with water. Washing ensures treat no hydroxylamine or ammonia is held within the gel volume of the resin. Dowex 50W X8 20 ml, in ammonium form was equilibrated at 25 C with 25 ml of an aqueous solution 4.78 N in ammonium sulfate and 1.92 N in hydroxylammonium sulfate, in which the pH had been adjusted to the desired test value with 14 N aqueous ammonium or 18 N sulfuric acid. The resin does then separated from the solution, washed well with water and the hydroxylamine and ammonia remaining in solution wereDetermined. The results of a series of experiments conducted in this manner at room temperature are shown in Table I, wherein Selectivity designate the ratio of hydroxylamine to ammonia remaining in the resin versus said ratio left in solution. When a solution of hydroxylammonium and ammonium salts at pH between about 4 and about 7 is passed through e sulfonic acid resin in the ammonium form, part of the hydroxylammmonium ions will be retained by ion exchange with ammonium ions and part of the uncharged hydroxylamine will be retained relative to ammonium ions because of ion exclusion. Washing of the resin with aqueous ammonia solution in an amount approximately equivalent to the amount of the ionically held hydroxylammonium ions will dislodge said ions as uncharged hydroxylamine which will then occupy the gel volume as discussed above. Subsequent washing of the resin with water will remove the hydroxylamine from the gel volume as a more or less distinct band. Thus during the elution steps hydroxylamine retained on or in the resin by either mechanism is eventually removed. TABLE I Apparent Ionic Selectivity versus pH pH Selectivity 2.2 0.92 3.5 0.87 4.2 0.91 5.1 0.93 6.0 0,74 6.6 0.53 6.7 0.48 6.9 0.34 7.5 0.20 7.9 0.11 It is thus seen that at the intermediate pH range of 4 7 both ion exchange and ion exclusion are manifested upon feeding of the solution to the resin. It should be noted that at the lower pH range ion exchange is the main mechanism for holding hydroxylamine in the resin, while at the high pH range ion exclusion retention in the gel volume is the main mechanism by which hydroxylamine is retained by the resin and comparatively little ammonia is needed for elution. When a feed solution containing hydroxylammonium sulfate, ammonium sulfate and sulfuric acid is passed continuously through a column of the ammonium sulfonate resin, hydroxylammonium ion is retained by the resin until the breakthrough point is reached. This first method of loading of the resin to the breakthrough point represents the maximum amount of hydroxylammonium ions that may be quantitatively removed by the resin from the feed solution.Passage of feed solution through the resin after that point repre runts a second method of loading and causes hydroxylammonium ions to appear in the effluent at progressively larger concentrations until the mole fraction of hydroxyl nmonium ion ap the m fraction of hydroxyl a monium io the eed solution. The resin at that point s essentially at aquilibri m with the feed solution and the loading represen s the equilibrium capacity of the resin for hydroxylammonium ion in the presence of excess feed solution. Both the loading to breakt rough and the loading to equilibrium are strongly influenced by the relative concentrations of hydroxylammonium ion, ammonium ion and proton in the feed solution as consequence of equations 1 and 2 . In a technical solution obtained via theRaschig process the equivalent ratio of hydroxylammonium ion to ammonium ion is from 0.3 to 0.5 and of hydroxylammonium ion to proton from 0.5 to 1. Consideration of the two methods of loading noted above leads to two different methods for isolating hydroxylammonium cation from a mixture with other cations. The first method of isolation is employed when a maximum percentage recovery of hydroxylammonium cations contained in a feed solution is desired. Then, the total amount of cations fed through the column must be equal to or less than the amount represented by the breakthrough point. In the second process, maximum output of hydroxylamine for a mizen column is desired. Then, the total about of cations fed through the column may be increased far beyond the breakthrough point so that a higher loading of the column, close to the equilibrium capacity, may be obtained. Because the second method produces a spent feed solution which still contains significant amounts of hydroxylammonium cation, it is practicable only when this solution can be subsequently utilized. Fortunately, there is a chemical process of industrial importance utilizing hydroxylamine in which the concentration of the hydroxylamine is not critical. This process is the synthesis of oximes by the reaction of hydroxylamine with aldehydes or ketones, and especially, the synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime which is a key intermediate in the manufacture of nylon 6. In the case that a partial recovery of hydroxylammonium cation is acceptable, the second method of loa and isolation has several advantages Because of the hig loading of the resin, a smaller amount of resin is reguire, for a given output of hydroxylamine. For the same reaso ., the hydroxylamine solution obtained upon elution witn ammonia according to the second method is generally more concentrated than the solution obtained by method A. Fur thermore, it is possible to obtain essentially ammonia free hydroxylamine solutions by utilizing a slight deficitn ammonia 90 to 95 mole percent during the elution ov az, ous base solution.This expedient obviates the necess for a later separation of ammonia from the hydroxylaine solution. The small amount of hydroxylamine remaining C the resin is eluted with the spent feed solution dunn next cycle. Since that solution is to be used as cS amine source in a subsequent process, for instance, oximation of cyclohexanone, no net loss of hydroxylamine is incurred. It will be appreciated that this expedient is no possible in the first method of loading and isolation, because in that case, any hydroxylamine left on the column would be lost for practical purposes. In calculating the amount of ammonia necessary to elution of hydroxylammonium cation from the column according to the process of the present invention, it is importan take into account the presence of protons on the resin.These take precedence over hydroxylammonium cation in consuming ammonia. The number of protons on the resin is a function of the mole fraction of protons in the feed solution. However, an ammonium sulfonate resin has relatively low affinity for protons relative to hydroxylammonium ion If complete removal of hydroxylamine from the resin is desired, the amount of ammonia used must be equivalent to or slightly in excess of the sum of hydroxylammonium ions d protons loaded on the resin. The hydroxylamine solution obtained in this case will contain small amounts of ammonia which can be eliminated by evaporation or fractional distillation.If hydroxylamine essentially free of ammonia is desired directly from the resin, the amount of ammonia used must be equivalent to the sum of the protons and of about 90 to 95 mole percent or less of the hydroxylammonium ions loaded on the resin. As mentioned earlier, ions which do not occupy exchange sites of the resin must be removed by washing with water, prior to elution by aqueous base solution. We have found that under certain conditions little or no washing of the sulfonic resin is necessary between the loading phase and the passing of aqueous ammonia solution. This is the case, for example, when columns longer than about 50 cm are used and the feed solutions are passed through the resin at linear velocities lower than about 5 cm min. However, a final water wash of the resin is necessary after the aqueous base solution such as aqueous ammonia is passed through the resin. We have observed that the ammonium ions that are displaced by hydroxylammonium ions during the loading halfcycle first appear in the effluent after about 0.3 bed volumes of effluent have been collected from the moment that hydroxylammonium cation containing solution is introduced to the resin column. A bed volume is the geometric volume occupied by a resin bed or column. On the other hand, the hydroxylamine that is displaced by ammonia during the elution half cycle first appears in the effluent after about 0.7 bed volumes of effluent have been collected from the moment that the ammonia solution is introduced to the resin column. The net effect is that the ammonium ion containing effluent is effectively separated from the hydroxylamine containing effluent without need of an intermediate water wash.In a continuous operation the ammonium ion displaced from the bed, appearing in the effluent of a given cycle, will be mixed with the hydroxylamine containing effluent of the preceding cycle, unless a sufficient water wash is used between the two cycles. These effects can be explained as follows. A resin bed contains three distinct volume elements a The geometric bed volume, which is defined as 1.0 bed volume. b The free volume which is the volume of water between the resin beads and is equal to abou 0.3 bed volume. c The gel volume, which is the volume of water contained in the gel structure of the resin beads and is equal to about 0.4 bed volume. Ionic species are excluded from the gel volume the resin by the Donnan exclusion phenomenon as described ion Exchange by F. Helfferich, McGraw Hill, New Yor, 1962, pp. 125 151, 431 434. As a result the void volume r ions is only the free volume of the resin1 i.e. 0.3 bed volume. Hydroxyl nine, however, being a neutral molecule has ready access to the gel volume as well as the free volume, i.e. the resin has an apparent void volume for hydroxylamine equal to about 0.7 bed volume. In the following examples the term Hydrox refe to a mixture containing hydroxylammonium sulfate, ammonia sulfate and sulfuric acid, plus minor amounts of tne corres ponding nitrates. These examples are given for illustrative purposes and to set forth the best ode contemplated by us of carrying out our invention and are not to be construed limiting the scope of the invention. Example 1 An illustration of the loading of a typical ammo nium sulfonate resin such as Dowex 50W X8 trademark cf Do Chemical Corp. in the ammonium form is shown in Table The resin was placed to a depth of 186 cm in a column of 1,5 cm inner diameter. The resin bed had a volume of 328 ml. and an exchange capacity equal to 649 millieqivalents. A feed solution representative of Raschig process, 1.78 normal in hydroxylammonium cation, 4.72 normal in ammonium cation and 1.936 normal in proton all as sulfates was passed at 50 C through the column at 7.4 ml. min. A forecut was collected until the effluent became acidic to bromothyenol blue, then effluent cuts, 20 ml. each, were taken and analyzed for hydroxylammonium cation, ammonium cation and protons.

Table 2 shows the mole fraction of hydroxylamine cation in each cut as a percentage of the mole fraction in the feed solution and the accumulated amount of hydroxylammonium cation and protons retained by the column. These quantities are compared with the total amount of cations, that is, hydroxylammonium cation, ammonium cation and protons eluted cumulatively. From Table 2, it can be seen that the retention of hydroxylammonium cation by the column is complete until about 530 millieqivalents of total cation are eluted, at which time hydroxylammonium cation breaks through and the mole fraction increases rapidly at fi then approaches asymptotically the hydroxylammonium cat mole fraction in the feed solution. As a consequence, hydroxylammonium cation retent increases linearly with total ions eluted up to t Ur through point at which time about 112 milliequivalents hydroxylammonium cation have been absorbed on the columnThereafter, the rate of retention declines until the tota amount of hydroxylammonium cation approaches asymptoticaily the value of about 200 milliequivalents which must be c,n sidered as the total capacity of the column for hydroxyl ammonium cation in equilibrium with a large excess OL t is particular feed solution. Similar tables can be constructed for feed solutions of different compositions and for resin of different exchange properties. Example 2 Synthetic Hydrox Solution A sulfonic acid resin, Amberlite IR 124 registered trade name of Rohm and Haas Corp. , was packed into a cylin drical glass tube of 1.5 cm. inner diameter to a depth or 186 cm.

A 60 ml. cut which was collected shortly after the introduction of ammonia contained 142 mequiv. NH2OH NH3OH , 44.8 of charge 1.1 mequiv. SO4 and 1.1 mequiv. NH4 . Example 6 Three cycle Run A sulfonic acid resin, Dowex 50W X8 trademark of Dow Chemical Corp. was placed in a cylindrical glass tube of 1.0 cm. inner diameter to a depth of 106 cm. The volume of the resin was 83 ml. and the capacity 164 mequiv. The resin was transformed to the ammonium form by passing 200 ml. of 1 M aqueous ammonia and then was washed with water.. A 30 ml. aqueous solution containfng 142 mequiv. NH 53 mequiv. NH30H , 58 mequiv. H and 253 mequiv. SO42 was passed through the resin followed sequentially by 30 ml.of water, 6.0 ml. of 4.216 N 25.3 mequiv. aqueous ammonia and 30 ml. of water. This cycle was repeated two more times. The temperature during the whole operation was maintained at 500C and the flow rate at about 4.4 ml. min. The effluent of the resin was monitored by means of a pH meter. Alternating acidic and basic fractions were eluted a d were collected in separate cuts. Three acidic cuts, pH range 0.6 to 7.0 were collected which had a combined volume of 215 ml. and contained 510 mequiv. NH4 , 102 mequiv. NH3O , 156 mequiv. H and 768 mequiv. SO4 . Three basic cuts, H range 7.0 to 8.5 were collected which had a combined volume of 70 ml. and contained 55 mequiv. of hydroxylamine, with nly traces of ammonia and SO2 , corresponding to 34.5 recovery of the hydroxylamine charged. Example 7 Three Cycle Run with Recycle The operation of Example 5 was repeated up t the first cycle inclusive. Four fractions were collected during this cycle labeled as follows the subscript indicate the number of cycle . A1, acidic cut, 59 ml. AT1, acid tailings, up to pH 6 B1, basic cut, 20 ml. BT1, basic tailings, up to p 6In subsequent cycles the charge seque e was the following 30 ml. of feed solution of the composition given in Example 6 followed by the acid tailings of th previous cycle, 20 ml. water, then 6.0 ml. of 4.216 N 2.3 mequiv. aquE us ammonia followed by the basic tail inc of the previous cycle, and finally 20 ml. of water. The average compo tion of a basic cut 20 ml. after the first cycle was 19.4 mequiv. NH2OH NH30H , 0.2 mequiv. 04 and 0.2 mequiv. NH3 NH4 2. This represented a 36.6, recovery of essen tially pure hydroxylamine in relatively high concentrati . Example 8 A sulfonic acid resin, Dowex 50W X8 trademark ofDow Chemical Corp. was placed in a cylindrical glass t of 1.0 cm. inner diameter to a depth of 53 cm. The sol of the resin was 42 ml. and the capacity 83 mequiv. The resin was transformed to the ammonium form by passing ml. of 1 N aqueous ammonia and then was washed with water A 4 liter solution containing 15 mequiv. NH4 , 15 mequiv. NH30H , 17 mequiv. H and 47 mequiv.SO42 was passt at 600C through the resin at the rate of 11 14 ml. min. The resin was then washed with 50 ml. of water, cooled to 30 C and 9.5 ml. of 4.216 N 40 mequiv. aqueous ammonia were sent through at the rate of 2.4 ml. min. followed by 5 ml. of water at the same rate. The cut that was collected after the introduction of aqueous ammonia had a volume o vO ml. and contained 7.04 mequiv. NH3 and 14.25 mequiv. NH2OH, or 95 of the hydroxylamine.charged. A 45 ml. aliquot a this cut was subjected to evaporation under reduced press in a rotary evaporator in order to remove NH3.When abcut 15 ml. had distilled off, the residue was acidified to pH 3.6 with H2SO4, then water was flashed off and the dry residue was triturated with absolute ethanol, filtered and dried. The white crystals collected consisted of pure NH3OH 2SO4 and weighed 0.829 g, or 75 recovery based on hydroxylamine charged. The yield difference between the hydroxylamine eluted from the column and the hydroxylamlne sulfate isolated in crystalline form is due to the partial evaporation of hydroxylamine in the rotary evaporator. Ih can be largely avoided by the use of fractional distillati instead of a single plate evaporation. Example 9 Carboxylic Acid Resin A carboxylic acid resin, Amberlite IRC 50 trademark of Rohm and Haas Corp. was transformed to the ammonium form by treatment with excess aqueous 2 M ammonia and then was loaded to a cylindrical glass tube of 4.4 cm. inner diameter to a depth of 44 cm. The volume of the resin was 670 ml. and the exchange capacity about 2300 mequiv. An aqueous solution, 175 ml. containing 586 mequiv. ,mH30H 2SO4 and 294 mequiv. NH4 2S04 was passed through the resin followed sequentially by 725 ml. of water, 175 ml.of 4 M aqueous ammonia and 825 ml. of water. The temperature during this operation was about 250C and the flow rate about 11 ml. min. A 1 liter basic cut was collected which contained 58 mequiv. NH3, 339 mequiv. NH2OH and no SO42This represents 57.8 recovery of hydroxylamine charged.
