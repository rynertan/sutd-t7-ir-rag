# Assembly for insulating a pipe.

## Abstract
An assembly for insulating a pipe comprises two insulator segments 22, 24 which are connected to and spaced apart by a resilient brace 26 . The insulator segments 22, 24 are each provided with a locking surface 28, 30 and a lower surface 32, 34 . A locking bar 36 having a top 37 and a pair of converging sides 38, 40 is conformingly inserted within the brace 26 and locking surfaces 28, 30 in order to mechanically secure the insulator segments 22, 24 around the pipe 10 . A refractory mortar 44 is applied to the interior of the locking plug 36 and the space between the diverging lower surfaces 32, 34 in order to protect the locking plug 36 from the furnace heat. The arrangement permits the insulator segments 22, 24 to be locked at a single point around the pipe 10 .
