# Apparatus for detecting ground fault in variable voltage variable frequency power system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting a ground fault in a power system 1, 3 which supplies an electric power whose fre quency is varied while being kept at a predetermined ratio to the voltage thereof. In this apparatus, a zero phase sequence current voltage from such power system is introduced to a plurality of current voltage detecting means 11A, B C hav ing respective threshold values for current 11A, B C voltage level detection, while a voltage related to the frequency of the electric power is introduced to a plurality of frequency detect ing means 10A, B having respective threshold values for frequency detection, and the output signals of the current 11A, B C voltage and frequency detecting means 10A, B are discriminated in accordance with predetermined logical condition 12 , whereby a signal representative of a ground fault is produced.
