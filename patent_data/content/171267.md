# TENSION LEVELING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A leveling apparatus for leveling strips of metallic material comprising a support housing 60 a guide tube 26 , rotatably attached to the support housing, having a hollow interior 34 and a longitudinal slot 36 a cylindrical support roll 22 , rotat ably attached to the housing and positioned within the guide tube a cylindrical work roll 20 having a diameter substantially less than the support roll and positioned within the slot and a feedback control 24 for rotating the guide tube 26 to posi tion the work roll 20 such that forces exerted upon the work roll by a metallic strip passing over it act to hold the work roll against the support roll 22 , and tangential components of the force tending to urge the work roll against the guide tube are minimized. In a preferred embodiment, the control comprises a pair of opposing cylinders 70, 72 which are pressurized by a source of compressed fluid. A servo valve 68 responsive to forces exerted by the work roll 20 upon the guide tube 26 depressurizes one of the cylinders and pressurizes the other causing an imbalance in which a rod joining the cylinders is dis placed to rotate the guide tube to a position in which the force exerted by the work roll upon the guide tube is minimized.
