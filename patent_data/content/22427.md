## Description
A self rnovinci benzine wit n hydrostatic advancement for the semi automatic harvest of tobacco.The present invention concerns a selE moving en gine with hydrostatic advancement for the semiautomatic harvest of tobacco.It is already well knovn that actually, in Italy and in all those Countries, where the cultivation of tobacco is limited to small fields, the harvest ing of the product is performed nearly complete ly by hand by workmen who, due to the hard work1 produce a yield which is not satisfactory when related to the market requests.Furthermore, in those Countries where said culti vation is performed on large areas, completely automatic engines are used for the harvesting, provided with arms moved in alternate motion1 caus ing the detachment of the leaves from the plant, making the same fall down onto a conveyor belt, said belt being placed centrally between said arms, whereby said belt provides the harvesting.Said automatic engines proved, however, to be extremely costly, to deteriorate to a high per centage the harvest product and to be clearly not suited and not economic, particularly for what concerns the use thereof on small fields or areas. It is the purpose of the preset invention to rea lize a self moving engine with a hydrostatic ad vancement for the harvesting of the tobacco leav es from the plants, presenting a very low cost, suited for the working in small areas and movable from one place to another, and taking away as little space as possible. Furthermore, said engine being s ni automatic and moving on the ground, said engine, according to the present invention forces the workmen to keep a constant working rhythm, whereby the same work in conditions which are much more comfortable than the conventional work.The aim os reached realizing a self moving wag gon, eventually a track, with a hydrostatic ad vancement, provided with a plurality of conveyor belts with a variable inclination, said belts being in turn provided, at the end thereof, with seats for the workmen, said waggon being surmounted by a working plane and carrying an elevator so as to perform the loading and unloading of the finished product.According to the present invention, the carrying structure of the engine consists of a plurality of uprights out of stamped plate, connected at the lower part thereof to the inner sides of the tracks for the support of the horizontal working plane, said working plane being prov ided with lateral edges which can be opened so as to increase the surface of said plane on the rear part Df said plane a pllr lity of conveyor belts are kooked provided, at the end thereof 1 with the seats for the workmen. Said belts hav ing a variable inclination, by means of an oleo dynamic device, allow to place the workman at different heights from the ground, thus also al lowing the comfortable harvest of the leaves.On the working plane a basin for the collection of the leaves is provided, facing the upper paBt of the conveyor belt said basin is provided, at the ends thereof, with a structure suited for containing the frames carrying the tobacco lea ves, which are packed directly on the engine.Said frames, once prepared, are placed onto a collecting basket provided on the pror.t part of the engine.Said basket is sliding, by means of a system provided with a hydraulic jack or ropes, onto lateral, vertical guides, and may be placed at different heights allowing the comfortable unload ing of the tobacco carrying frames contained therein.In another embodiment of the present invention, the collection basket may be replaced by a con tainer, also sliding on guides by means of ro pes or a hydraulic jack, and being provided with a level ground which can be downwardly open ed by means of hydraulic jacks. In said container the collected tobacco leaves may be placed, ac cording to another known way of working.In the engine according to the present invention a Diesel motor transmits the motion, by means of coupling, to the oleodynamic pumps connected with the hydraulic motors which, being hooked in said stamped plate uprights, transmit the motion to the driving wheels by means of chains placed in side said uprights.In another embodiment of the present invention the motion can be determined by using a hydrau lic motor provided with an axial reducer being directly hooked onto the driving wheel. In a fur ther embodiment of the engine not using tracks, but two or four driving tyres said hydraulic motors are instead directly placed onto said tyres.The Diesel motor is further provided with an o leodynamic pump of the already well known kind, for all the requested services, being operated by the driver of the engine.The conveyor belts placed at the back part of the engine will be operated by means of a hy draulic motor and a mechanic transmission. In this case the r otor transmits, by means of a chain, the motion to an axis of a polygonal secticn, sliding inside upper rolls, transritt ing, at the same time, the rotation motion to all of the conveyor belts.The remarkable dimentions of the engine when working are reduce to a minirr. iri, thus allowing an easy circulation on tne streets, by closing the edges of the level ground downwardly and placing said belts in the centre making the saine slide onto the upper guide whereon the sane are hooked.In a further enbodinent of the present irve tion said engine is provided instead with a plurality of vertical conveyor belts provided, at the lo er end thereof, with seats for the workmen, with only one, centrally placed, vertical conveyor belt, connected, at the lower end thereof, with two ho horizontal conveyor belts, sliding towards said cen tral, vertical conveyor belt. Said horizontal con veyor belts are placed at at least 1.5C neters from the ground, so that the workmen can cut the upper part of the tobacco plants and put the sa me onto the conveyor belts, which feed said to bacco leaves to the central, vertical conveyor belt, which in turn feeds the leaves to the up per working plane. In this case the workmen are not sitting, but follow the movement of the en ine.
