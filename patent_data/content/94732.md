# Improved steam generator for liquid metal fast breeder reactor.

## Abstract
In a steam generator for a liquid metal fast breeder reactor comprising an essentially vertical, J shaped tube bundle with a bent over section disposed between tube sheets mounted in a mainly vertical J shaped housing surrounding the tube bundle, the tube bundle is supported in the vertical housing section by at least one cruciform support structure permitting radial expansion of said tube bundle relative to the housing section but retaining the tube bundle centrally within the housing section, and the tubes are so supported as to permit up and downward movement of the tubes relative to the bent over housing section.
