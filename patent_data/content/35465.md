# Rotary fuel injection pump.

## Abstract
A rotary fuel injection pump with pump plunger stroke regulating means provided by an axially adjust able abutment slide 92 for each plunger 42 for limiting its outward stroke in accordance with the axial position of the abutment slide 92 established by the angular position of a control ring 68 . The pump is provided with a plurality of plungers 42 mounted in diametral bores 40 of a rotor 12 for radial reciprocation therein. The outward stroke of each plunger 42 is limited by the engagement of an abutment lip 112 on an axially adjustable limit stop member 92 with an axial edge 116 of a roller shoe 58 . The limit stop member 92 com prises an elongated rail 108 received within an inclined slot 110 of a fixed adjacent insert 94 to provide a slide connection therebetween for adjusting the limit stop mem ber 92 radially by axial adjustment thereof according to the angular position of a control ring 68 .
