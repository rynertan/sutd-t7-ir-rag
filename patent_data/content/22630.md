# Method and apparatus for implanting a charge in an electret foil.

## Abstract
In previously proposed arrangements for charging an electret foil the electret charge implanted varies over the area of the foil. In order to promote more even charging of the foil, the method of the invention subjects the foil 11 to a progressively increasing electric field. One form of apparatus used to carry out the method has rollers 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 at progressively higher potentials and electric fields are applied across the foil 11 between these rollers and a metallised layer 12 on the rear face of the foil which is earthed by a roller 7 .
