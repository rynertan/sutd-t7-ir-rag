Photographic elements intended to generate dye images containing at least one colloidal silver layer and at least one hydroquinone antistain agent have incorporated therein a cata lyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to reduce ran dom fog spotting. The iniagewise exposed elements when photographically processed and bleached of silver produce viewable dye images.
