## Description
TETRA PAK INTERNATIONAL AKTIEBOLAG Rabyholms, Alle Lund, Sweden The present invention relates to a method of performing a treatment operation on objects which are being conveyed in a continuous equispaced succession on a conveyor, especially for applying accessary articles to packaging containers, wherein the articles, with unchanged order and spacing, are successively taken off the conveyor by an auxiliary conveying means moving in synchronism with the conveyor, are transferred through a substantially closed loop path, which passes through the treatment performing station, and are replaced onto the conveyor. Conventionally such a method requires first conveying means by which the articles are fed to the auxiliary conveying zreans. and n second additional conveying means by which the articles are taken away from the auxiliary conveying means at a position spaced from said first conveying means. For this reason there is no way to avoid the necessity to make the structure of the apparatus complicated and space consuming. Furthermore it is difficult to handle the articles by means of an auxiliary conveying means describing a substantially closed loop path, unless the articles are of circular cross section. It is therefore the aim of the present invention to provide a method for performing a treatment operation on objects by which these disadvantages are removed. This aim in an above described method is solved according to the invention by the method steps that the circumferencial length of the closed loop path is a non integral multiple of the spacing of the articles, that the pick up and replacing of the articles from and to the conveyor is performed at substantially the same point along the length of the conveyor, and that each untreated article is picked up onto the auxiliary conveying means in the gap between two treated articles and each treated article is replaced onto the conveyor in the gap between two successive untreated articles. The invention is furthermore related to an apparatus for performing a treatment opetation on objects which are being conveyed in continuous succession on a conveyor, particularly for applying accessary articles to packaging containers, comprising means for establishing an equidistant spacing between successive articles on the conveyor, a revolving holding device having a plurality of equidistant holders for an article and moving in synchronism with said conveyor for moving the holder through a substantially closed loop path, at least one treatment station through which said closed loop path passes, each holder being provided with actuable means for picking up an article from said conveyor and, after having moved through the closed loop path, replacing the article onto the conveyor. To avoid the above mentioned disadvantages of the conventional apparatuses the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the spacing pf the articles on the conveyor is an integral multiple of the spacing of the holders on the revolving holding means, and the number of holders on the revolving holding means is not dividable by said multiple, whereby a full turn of said holding means will position a treated article into a gap between successive articles on the conveyor and will position an empty holder to coincide with an untreated article on the conveyor. Preferably the holders of the revolving device are suction holes or suction cups which are connected to a vacuum generating device. Preferably each of the suction pipes of the suction cups are equipped with a valve connected to a valve transfer lever for closing and opening the valve. This lever preferably is actuated by a fixed cam supported by the frame of the apparatus and a movable cam which is rotatably supported by the frame. By means of these cams the suction cups are automatically activated or inactivated at the proper position thereof. When provided with a continuous strip of accessary articles the apparatus is preferably also provided with a rotatable device having a plurality of ridge parts being parallel to each other. This rotatable device is adapted to turn an angle corresponding to the feeding distance of the continuous strip so that the strip of accessary articles is effectively adjusted to its position with respect to the subsequent station e.g. the treatment station. Preferably this rotatable device is of triangular or polygonal cross section or has a substantially lentoid cross section. Preferably a rising preventive member is provided having the corresponding cross section and being arranged in the vicinity of the rotational device and being driven in synchronism therewith. By this rotatable device and the corresponding rising preventive member the continuous strip is effectively positioned and accurately conveyed by a particular distance corresponding to the turn angle of the rotational device. Preferably the transfer device for transferring and sealing the accessary article to the packaging container can be provided with a vacuum holding device comprising a void chamber and a pressure chamber, which chambers are separated by a separating wall, said void chamber being equipped at its inside with a plurality of vacuum generatingVenturi tubes each communicating with the suction pipe, said pressure chamber being connected to an air pipe for supplying pressurized air and a pressure chamber being connected to the chamber of said Venturi tubes. By this preferable vacuum holding device or transmission drum a stable vacuum pressure can be obtained without being influenced by any air leakage. Furthermore the probability of trouble is reduced as much as possible. As an alternative the rotatable transfer drum can preferably be arranged to turn in synchronism with the article to be treated, the rotating shaft of the transfer drum being inclined with respect to the axis of the revolving holding device one half of a desired inclining angle at which the accessary article shall be sealed diagonally over the packaging container. By means of this preferred embodiment the accessary article can be fed automatically to the packaging container under desired angle and can be delivered to the transferring drum e.g. in a continuous strip. This highly simplifies the method and apparatus of the invention. Preferably in the treatment station of the apparatus according to the invention a pushed plate is arranged which is adapted to make a combined movement including a circular movement in synchronism with the movement of the revolving holding device and a movement in a direction tangentially to the revolving device. By means of this pusher plate the accessary article effectively is contact bonded to the packaging container without scrubbing the accessary article. The abovementioned and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by reference to the following description of preferred embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, whereinFig. 1 is a front view of the device for adhering the accessarS article to the packaging container accor ding to the present invention.

Fig. 1 is a front view of a spoon adhering device equipped with the device for supplying the package container to the bucket wheel and taking it out from said wheel according to the present invention, in which the numeral 1 is the bucket wheel for receiving the package container P, as shown in fig. 2 and subsequently transferring it therefrom, the rotation of which is illustrated to be accompanied by adsorbing the package container P which is successively conveyed by the bucket conveyor so that the package container P may be held by the bucket wheel 1, the package container P then becomes in contact with the small bag B containing the spoon which is transmitted by a drum for transferring the package, when it reaches the upper position through passing the rotational process by the bucket wheel, said small bag B is, as shown in fig. 2, adhered to the side of the package container P, which is subsequently transmitted down in successive order and reaches the con veyor, being carried toward left side. The small bag B containing the spoon is, as shown in fig. 3, formed by means of cutting out said small bags B one by one during the intermediate course of the process from a long and narrow strip of continuous package C comprising two sheets of synthetic resin films, the clearance between which the spoon is inserted and contained after welding them at their predetermined position. Figs. 4 to 10 illustrate the flow of the process in which the package container P is successively supplied from the bucket conveyor 3 to the bucket wheel 1, the small bag B is adhered to the package container P which has reaches the upper position of its rotating process, the small bag B is then transferred down, and the package container P to which said small bag is adhered is successively fed out of the wheel, being carried out by the conveyor. This bucket wheel 1 possesses package container receptacles buckets D in odd number 15 units in the drawings , whereas the bucket conveyor 3 is arranged to be horizontally removed below the above mentioned bucket wheel 1, the pitch between the buckets of the bucket conveyor 3, i.e. the pitch between the normal positions to the package containers fixed by convex portions pushing the package containers so as to feed them, is formed to be double in width of that between the buckets of the abovementioned bucket wheel, both the buckets being formed to be in the same phase to each other at the bottom of the bucket wheel where the above mentioned wheel has access to the above mentioned bucket conveyor. As shown in figs. 11 and 12, suction pipes N for adsorbing the package container P by vacuum action are provided with aperture on the bottoms of the buckets D placed on the external periphery of the bucket wheel 1, each of these suction pipes N being equipped with a valve for giving rise to suction action and releasing such an action by the vacuum action and a valve transfer lever L for closing opening the valve, thevibrating motion of which adapts the suction pipes N to adsorb the package containers in a direction toward the buckets by suction action generated by the vacuum, or to be released from such an action, thereby making the package containers one by one free from the adsorbing force. At the main bodies side on which the bucket wheel is provided, a fixed cam 4 is rotatively supported directly by a frame 9 and a movable cam 5 is rotatively supported through a bearing by the frame 9. The acting part of these cams is provided in a manner of touching a rotating locus of an actuating roller L pivoted to the top end of the above mentioned valve transfer lever L. Figs. 13 to 16 are views illustrating the relationship between each of the valve transfer levers L which are provided on the bucket wheel 1 in a manner of rotating thereon and the fixed cam 4 as well as the relationship between said valve transfer levers and the movable cam 5 which is rotated in interlocking with the bucket wheel 1. The above mentioned fixed cam 4 pushes the actuating roller L pivoted to the top end of the valve transfer lever L which is rotated to be moved so that the suction pipe N may be led into the suction state by the vacuum in order to adsorb the package container, whereas the movable cam 5, interlocking with the rotation of the bucket wheel 1, is adapted to be vibratingly moved through a crank 7 and a connecting rod 8 by a circular cam 6 which is rotated completely once whenever the bucket D of the bucket wheel takes a two pitch rotation corresponding to a double interval between said buckets, and when the bucket D of the bucket wheel reaches the position right under the abovementioned wheel near the bucket conveyor 3, the movable cam 5 is adapted to push the valve transfer lever L to be moved so as to release the suction pipe N from the suction action, whereby the package container P is made free from the adsorbing force so that it commences to be taken out. Next, the actuation of the foregoing device according to the present invention may be described as follows As shown in fig. 4, the package container P1 which has reached the position right under the bucket wheel 1 after being carried by the bucket conveyor 3 is housed in the bucket D of the bucket wheel by means of being adsorbed thereto. In that case, in order to facilitate adsorption action, it may be advantageous to have another separate means for pushing up the package container in synchronism with the adsorption housing thereof .Subsequently, when the wheel 1 hereinafter the bucket wheel is referred to as the wheel o turns clockwise by two pitches corresponding to two intervals between the buckets, the package containers P2 which is going to be carried while being held in the following bucket of the bucket conveyor 3 is housed in next bucket but one in which the last package container P1 was housed by means of being adsorbed thereto.Thus, with the continued rotation of the wheel 1, the package containers on the bucket conveyor are housed one by one in every other following bucket of the wheel 1 by being adsorbed thereto in sequence of p2, BR p3, ... and further to approaching of the package container P1 to its rotational top position, the small bag B is transferred to be adhered to said package container by a drum for transferring the package 2 see fig. 5 , the package containers P1 , P2 P3 to which the small bag were adhered are successively transmitted down and the package container P to which the small bag was adhered reaches the position which is located by one pitch this side of the position at which the package container was located in undergoing the last adsorption action. See fig. 6 .At that time the bucket of the bucket conveyor possessing the pitch, double in width of the pitch between the buckets of the wheel, is located the position under the wheel into which the package container P1, was housed from the bucket conveyor by means of being adsorbed at the first process, so the package container P8 on said bucket conveyor is housed in the bucket D of the wheel by means of being adsorbed thereto. Subsequently, the package container P1 which was adsorbed at the first process reaches the abovementioned position, a mechanism, which is referred to in the below part, is operative in releasing the package container P1, from the adsorption force on the conveyor D, whereby said package container P falls on the bucket conveyor so that it is taken out therefrom, See fig.7 . At that time, the following void bucket, in which the package container P1 was housed by means of being adsorbed, of the wheel 1 is in a position to give rise to adsorbing action, the subsequent package container p9 on the bucket conveyor 3 is removed synchronously with the motion of said void bucket D of the wheel and when said void bucket of the wheel reaches the above mentioned lowest position, the package container P9 is housed in said void bucket by means of being adsorbed thereto and the package container P1 which fell to be taken out at the prior process remains to be carried on the conveyor. See fig. 8 .Since then, in a manner similar to the above mentioned cases, the package container p2, falls to be taken out see fig. 9 , package container P10 is housed in the bucket D by means of being adsorbed thereto, and the package container P3 at the side of the wheel falls to be taken out, such a flow of the process being successively repeated. Next, the actuation which is made in setting adsorption action of the package container P to the bucket D of the bucket wheel 1 to ON OFF may be described as follows At the time of the situation, as shown in fig. 13, wherein the valve transfer lever L1 for the suction pipe of the bucket D1 of the bucket wheel 1 is pushed to be moved by the movable cam 5, whereby said suction pipe is released from the suction action so that the package container is made free from the suction force, falling on the conveyor and commencing to be carried thereon, the suction pipe for the bucket D2 of the wheel is in a position to give rise to the suction action by the corresponding process in which the valve transfer lever L2 for the bucket D2 is pushed to be moved by the fixed cam 4, whereas the movable cam 5, which has completed movement to push the valve transfer lever L1 to be moved, is in a position to be withdrawn from the rotational locus Of the actuating roller of the valve transfer lever L2. Fig. 14 illustrates the situation in which the bucket wheel turns clockwise to be removed by 1 2 of the pitch between the buckets from the situation illustrated by fig. 13. At the time the bucket D2 of the bucket wheel 1, which reaches the position of housing the package container in the corresponding bucket, located near to the conveyor 3, commences to house the package container P16, which is going to be carried, therein by means of adsorbing It and additionally the movable cam 5 is still withdrawn from the passage of the actuating roller of the valve transfer lever L2. Furthermore, the valve transfer lever L3 which maintains the bucket D3 in the adsorbing state is not pushed to be moved but passes along the external periphery of the fixed cam 4.Fig. 15 illustrates the situation in which the bucket wheel turns clockwise to be removed by one pitch between the buckets from the situation shown by fig. 14, the rotation of which adapts the valve transfer lever L3 which keeps the suction pipe in the adsorbing state to push the actuating roller of said valve transfer lever L3 to be moved by the corresponding process in which the movable cam 5 rotatively moves clockwise, whereby the bucket D3 is released from the adsorption force of the suction pipe so that the package container P3 which was adsorbed to the bucket D3 falls on the conveyor 3, commencing to be taken out.Subsequently, in response to the process that the valve transfer leverL4 for the bucket D4 which is kept in non adsorbing state is pushed to be moved by the contact of the roller of said valve transfer lever L4 with the fixed cam 4, the suction pipe of the bucket D4 commences to give rise to the suction action.Fig. 16 illustrates the situation in which the bucket wheel turns clockwise to be removed by 1 2 of the pitch between the buckets from the situation shown by fig. 15, i.e. the situation in which a two pitch turn is made clockwise from the situation shown by fig. 13 at that time the moveable cam is withdrawn from the state as shown in fig. 15 and accompanied with carrying the package container P1 and 23 , the suction pipe of the bucket D4, maintaining the adsorption action, reaches the position right under the wheel, while the valve transfer lever L4 for said bucket D4 of the wheel 1 is not pushed to be moved by the movable lever L5, so that the package container P17 is housed in the bucket D4 by means of being adsorbed thereto. Thus, the fixed cam 4 generally adapts the valve transfer lever L to lead its corresponding suction pipe into the adsorbing state, whereas the movable cam 5 can take out the package containers, which are transmitted one by one while being adsorbed to every other bucket of the bucket wheel 1, on the conveyor. As clearly shown by the foregoing description, according to the device of the present invention, compared with the conventional device for supplying and taking out the object to be carried to the bucket wheel, not only the wheel for inserting the object from the conveyor to the bucket wheel but the wheel for taking out the object from the bucket wheel to the conveyor are not needed so that the structure of the device is made simple and another advantage makes it possible to handle a object of section other than circular, for example, of semi circular section which has been unable to be handled by the conventional device of this kind. Since housing the package container, i.e. the object to be carried to the bucket of the bucket wheel, to be held in the bucket and taking it out of the wheel can be performed only by setting the suction action of the suction pipe of the bucket wheel to ON OFF through the corresponding actuation of the fixed cam and the movable cam which are provided on the main body, the structure of the device may be simple enough not to need any electrical control such as a vacuum valve. With regard to the bucket wheel possessing the bucket in odd number, the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment has put its focus on the arrangement in which the bucket wheel is maintained in a vertical state, but the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement and allows said wheel to be in a horizontal state so that the commodity to be carried is supplied thereto and taken out therefrom. Fig. 17 is a longitudinal sectional view of the bucket wheel according to fig. 11. The peripheral part of the main body of the bucket wheel which is rotatively driven by the driving shaft 21 is equipped with a plurality of housing parts D 15 pcs. at uniform interval in the drawing which fit the shape of the article to be conveyed. The suction pads are mounted on the bottom parts of said housing parts D, whereby the article to be conveyed are adsorbed to be held by said suction pads 24. Between a face plate 22a of the main turret 22 and a back plate 22b of the main turret 22, which is formed by the face plate 22a and the back plate 22b, the suction pads 24 and the Venturi tubes 25 are inserted to be provided and a transfer valve 26 for setting the compressed air to ON OFF is mounted on the back plate 22b of the main turret 22 so that these composite parts are united as one unit. A exhaust pipe 26a of the transfer valve is adapted to communicate with the Venturi tube, the vacuum circuit 25a of which is connected to the suction pads 24. On the other hand, from the driving shaft 21 of the main turret 22, employing a pipelike shape, the compressor air is supplied to a plurality of transfer valves 26 through pipings 27. The air passage formed through the driving shaft 21 is connected to the optional compressed air source such as the compressor not shown . The transfer valves for the compressed air can be mechanically shifted by levers L, one example of which may be found in ON OFF setting operations by cams 4 and 5 provided near to the main turret. Additionally, the numeral 10 in the drawings is a silencer connected to each of the exhaust holes of theVenturi pipes 25. The compressed air supplied from the air passage 21a through the driving shaft 21 passes through the pipings 27, reaching the transfer valves 26 so that it actuates the suction pads 24, utilizing the vacuum pressure generated by the Venturi tubes 25. In all of these composite parts, which are arranged on the main turret 22 under rotation, there are no relative sliding and movable parts except for the levers of the transfer valves. According to the rotary adsorbing device of the present invention, since the supply of the compressed air and the utilization of the Venturi tubes cause the vacuum to be generated in each of the suction pads, inasmuch as the pressure of the compressed air is maintained at the constant level, even separate actuation of numerous suction pads does neither deteriorate the vacuum pressure of other suction pads nor give any other influence to them so that each of suction pads is stably actuated, maintaining a constant disposing capability. In particular, compared with the operation of maintaining the constant vacuum pressure by the vacuum pump, the present device is extremely easy to maintain the compressed air at the constant level. In addition, according to the rotary adsorbing device of the present invention, the simple structure thereof does not possess any movable part, needing no precision valve mechanism for the electric accurate control which is indispensable to the operation by the vacuum pump, so there may be extremely few possibility of air leakage due to abrasion or other trouble. Therefore, no electrical parts exist therein in addition to being washable, the external surface of the present unit reducing number of complicated undulations so that it is easy to clean. Such an example in which it is put into practical use for the mechanical device handling the food is sanitarily recommendable. Fig. 18 shows the feed device of the apparatus by means of which the continuous strip C of accessary articles e.g. of spoons, is supplied to a cutter mechanism 33. The package B containing the accessary article is delivered at the constant pitch E of the distance equivalent to the width of the package B when supplying the continuous strip to the cutter mechanism 33. Conventionally, however, such a disadvantage as wide scatter of final cutting position has incurred, because errors in measurements, which are ascribed to small warpage of the pitch E originating from expansion and contraction of materials due to the change in temperature, the error in measurement at the production, and tensile elongation of materials, are gradually added to together, while the long and narrow strip of continuous package C is maintained to be cut. That is, when the cutting position unavoidably goes wide of the part B to have been welded in widthwise direction of the long and narrow strip of continuous packageC, each of the packages B is forced to be opened. Fig. 18 is an enlarged view only of the feed device 32 constituting the spoon adhering machine as shown in fig. 1.This feed device 32 comprises the triangular pillarlike rotational article 35 and a rising preventive member 36 of triangular pillarlike shape, provided near to the rotational article 35, which turns in an opposite direction under synchronism with the rotational article 35. Thus, the winding hang of the long and narrow strip of continuous package which is hung around guide rollers 37 and 38 over the rotational article 35 is followed by the supply of the long and narrow strip of continuous package C to the cutter mechanism 33, which will perform the subsequent process. The cutter mechanism 33 has its disc shaped rotational blade pass across the long and narrow strip of continuous package C so as to cut the same, during the period of which the long and narrow strip of continuous package C is adapted to be suspended in interlocking with the motion of the rotational blade of the cutter mechanism, the rotational device 35 takes intermittently a rotational movement by one third of a complete turn per pitch, whereby the long and narrow strip of continuous package C is fed out by distance equivalent to the package B containing a spoon every one motion of the rotational device 35. Next, the situation in which the long and narrow strip of continuous package C is fed out by means of the rotational device 4s described in conjunction with fig. 19 as follows As shown in fig. 19 a , the long and narrow strip of continuous package C which is windingly hung over the triangular pillarlike rotational device 35 is supported at its packaging part B1 containing the spoon made of an unbending rigid body and its soft welded B part just after the last packaging part B1, i.e. its connected part B2 by the ridge part 39 of the triangular pillar shown as summit of triangle in the drawings .That is, the long and narrow strip of continuous package C which is being drawn by a constant tension F1 is supported at its soft connected part B2 by the ridge part of the rotational device 35, being drawn forward while sliding on the ridge part thereof, and when the packaging part B1 containing the rigid spoon is in contact with the ridge part thereof, the inability of the spoon to be bent produces a marked resistance so that the relative relationship between the long and narrow strip of continuous package C and the rotational device 35 is corrected. If the packaging part B1 is extruded from the predetermined position, the tension F1 is worked out to return it to the foregoing original position. The rotational device 35 commences to take a rotational motion from the state as shown in fig. 19 a , passes through each of states as shown in figs. 19 b , c , d and e , and reaches the state, as shown in fig. 19 f , i.e. finishes to turn by 1200, feeding out the long and narrow strip of continuous package C by the distance equivalent to one package B so that the rotational device 35 stops once. With advance of the rotational device 35 through the states as shown in figs. 19 c , d and e , a clearance between the feeding side of the long and narrow strip of continuous package C and the rotational device 35 takes place.In other words, the angle at which the packaging part B1 is bent by the ridge part is slackened and the packaging part B1 rises so that it becomes easily slideable, but the rising preventive member 30 is actuated to prevent it from rising. As for the rising preventive member 30, located near to the rotational device 35, a stationary unit may be applicable thereto, only if it allows the rotational device 35 to turn.A further alternative may adapt it to take a rotational motion synchronous with that of the rotational device 35 so that the distance between the packaging part B1 and the rising preven tive member 30 is maintained to be as small as possible, thereby making the effect of preventing rise higher. It is, for example, possible to put a belt or roller for pushing the packaging part B1 into practical use as the preventive member. Variants such as a flat plate as shown in fig. 22 or a polygonal pillar having more than four sides as shown in fig. 23 may be applicable as the rotational device 35, only if they meet the regUirements that they should have a plurality of parallel ridge parts uniformly. When the polygonal pillar having more than four sides is employed as the rotational device 35, the package B, can be morse easily slidable thereon, because the ridge part of the rotational article makes its internal angle obtuse. For this reason, as shown in fig. 23, it is preferable to have its ridge part formed as acute angle by means of making a dent on the rotational device 35. There is, however, still no alternative but to incur the slidability of the long and narrow strip of continuous package C on the rotational article s ridge parts, adjacent to each other, between the parts of which the long and narrow strip of continuous package C is drawn. From that view the triangular pillar is preferably applied to the rotational device 35 and additionally the rising preventive member of the same shape is adapted to take the rotational motion synchronous with that of the rotational article, thereby producing greater effectiveness. The rising preventive member 36 is not always needed and as shown in fig. 21 it is permissible to use the rotational device 35 independently. Such a probability is based on the fact that the effects of correcting the position of the long and narrow strip of continuous package on the ridge part 39 of the rotational device 35 is subject to the correlation between the change in rigidity of the packaging part B1 of the long and narrow strip of continuous package C and the connected part B2 thereof and the tension F1 and F2.If one tension F1 exceeds another tension F2, as shown by an imaginary line in fig. 21, the packaging part B1 passes beyond the ridge part of the rotational device 35 so that it rises, but when the difference between F1 and F2 is within the constant range, the foregoing fear can be avoided. With regard to the tension F1 and F2, one of which may be increased compared with another, if the tension F1 working in the advance direction is increased, the standard for correcting the position is set to the front end of the packaging part, whereas if the tension F2 working in the similar direction or in the incoming direction is increased, the standard therefore is set to the rear end of the packaging part B1. An alteration from the embodiment illustrated in the drawing, wherein the length of one side of the triangular pillar is approximately equal to the measurements E per one piece of package B, may be made in a manner that the length of one side of the triangular pillar equals the measurements of more than two pieces of packages B so that the angle at which the rotational device 35 takes the rotational motion is decreased. Futhermore, a practical use of the rotational device 35 may be applied to feed out a plurality of package as a unit. Notice ought to be taken of the necessity that there shall be a change in rigidity between the packaging part of the long and narrow strip of continuous package and the connected part thereof so that the present invention may be put into practical use. When there is a warpage in the position into which the long and narrow strip of continuous package is fed out in response to the subsequent process, or when the primary position, into which the long and narrow strip of continuous package is first fed out, is necessary to be established, proper adjustment may be made by changing the starting position phase only of the rotational article interlocked with the subsequent process. Next, one example of adjusting the phase is described in conjunction with fig. 20 as follows A gear 311 and a sleeve 312 are freely fit on a driving shaft 310 interlocked with the cutter mechanism subsequently performing the next process, a long hole 313 is inserted into the sleeve 312 in an oblique spiral direction, and a pin 314 projecting from the driving shaft 310 is fit in said long hole 313. Then, the interlocking between the sleeve 312 and the gear 311 is made by a key 315. Such a fabrication transmits a turn of the driving shaft 310 to the sleeve 312 by means of the pin 314 and from the sleeve 312 it is transmitted to the gear 311 by the transmission caused by the key 315. Together with the gear 311 on the driving shaft being in mesh with the gear 317 on the shaft 316 of the rotational device 35, another group of gears 318 and 319 synchronizes the rotational motion of the rotational device 35 with that of the rising preventive member 36. A female screw 321 threaded on a male screw 320 which is provided at the front edge of the sleeve 312 is mounted on the driving shaft 310 by small screw 322. That means the female screw 321, rotatable, is set not to freely move axially. For this reason, in order to change phase of the rotational device 35, a knob 323 united with the female screw 321 as one unit is turned, whereby the sleeve 312 threaded into said knob 323 moves forward and backward. Since the sleeve 312 and the driving shaft 310 are engaged with spiral shaped long hole by the pin 314, the relative rotational position between the driving shaft 310 and the sleeve 312, i.e. the phase between the rotational device 35 and the driving shaft 310, is correspondingly changed. According to the feed device of the long and narrow strip of continuous package of the present invention, because there is the possibility of accurately feeding out the package to the subsequent process with the number of packages or other articles having rigidity applied as standard for working process, even if the pitch between packages of the long and narrow strip of continuous package is forced to be altered due to the error in their production and the change in temperature, no warpage in feeding number takes place. The illustrated embodiment,wherein the long and narrow strip of continuous package is cut into small units of packages, may make it needless to fear that the goods of inferior quality will be produced by reason of the cutting position going wide of the welded part by mistake. The foregoing embodiment, wherein the rising preventive member is combined with the feed device, adapts the rising preventive member to be stably and accurately actuated. If an adjustment of the phase between the rotational position of the rotational device and the interlocking of the rotational device with the subsequent process is adapted to be possible, the feed device of the long and narrow strip of continuous package according to the present invention can be put into practical use for various kinds of packages, when the width of the package, i.e. the pitch of the long and narrow strip of continuous package is different to the extent within the range where such a difference can be absorbed by the slide of the rotational device. Fig. 24 to 26 show a transmission drum for transmitting accessary articles,e.g. spoons from a cutting device to the sealing station. According to fig. 24 the continuous strip C is fed to the cutting device where it is cut into separate bags B of accessary articles. These single packages B are transported by means of the transmission drum 41 to the bucket wheel 1 where they are sealed to articles P contained in the buckets of the wheel 1. Fig. 25 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the transmission drum 41. As for this kind of transmission drum it is ordinary that a plurality of suction pipes which are fixed to a rotational article are connected to one vacuum source. In order to maintain the constant vacuum pressure, however, higher airtight conditions must be kept. In other words, since slight air leakage extremely deteriorates the vacuum pressure, in the first place, there is a necessity of mounting a passage or a joint, highly airtight, on a rotary mechanism and furthermore, it is needed to completely close other suction pipes except for the suction pipes performing the adsorption process, because the air leakage from one suction pipe, if any,has a considerable impact upon other pipes. For this reason, the vacuum mechanism of the past, which has been forced to include a movable part, has its structure formed so complicated that trouble may be caused by such a complexity. Fig. 25 shows a transmission drum which not only can obtain a stable vacuum pressure without being influenced by the air leakage by using high pressure air source the change in pressure of which is not comparatively subject to the air leakage and a Venturi tube which can produce a vacuum negative pressure state by the high pressure air but also reduce any probability of trouble as much as possible by means of making the movable part smaller. While a rotational article 41 which is rotatively driven is of a cylinder and hollow in its inside by means of closing tight both its ends with lid bodies 42 and 43, the inside is divided into a void chamber 45 and a pressure chamber 46 which is air tight by a partition wall 44. Double lines, internal and external, of exhaust pipe 47 and air pipe 48 are inserted along the rotary shaft line of the rotational article 41 so that the exhaust pipe 47 and the air pipe have openings to the void chamber 45 and the pressure chamber 46, respectively. Although the illustrated embodiment has the exhaust pipe 47 fixed to the rotational article 41 so that the exhaust pipe 47 serves also for the driving shaft at the same time, an alternative is to equip the rotational article with a separate driving device and to make the exhaust pipe be a fixed shaft. A further alternative may have the end of the exhaust pipe 47 opened to the void chamber 45, although in the preferred embodiment the exhaust pipe 47 penetrates the void chamber, a plurality of vent holes being adequately mounted thereon. A plurlityof.Venturi tubes 410 which are fixed in the void chamber 45, are adapted to communicate with the suction pipe 411 having a vacuum generating circuit 410a thereof extruded outwardly and at the same time a pressure circuit 410b is adapted to communicate with the pressure chamber 46 by means of a connected pipe 412. Next, the focus of the description is shifted toward the actuation of the vacuum adsorbing device,incorporated into the transmission drum according to the present invention The high pressure air, which is supplied from the high pressure air source such as a compressor not shown and others, passes through the air pipe 48 and reaches the inside of the pressure chamber. From the pressure chamber 46, the high pressure air 48 passes through the connecting pipe 412 and is supplied to Venturi pipes 410, whereby the vacuum pressure, constantly stablized, is generated in the suction pipe 411, subsequently being discharged from an exhaust hole 413 of the Venturi tube 410 to the void chamber 45, passing through the vent hole 49 and being discharged out of the machine by means of the exhaust pipe 47. At that time, if the pressure chamber 46, being void, has a larger capacity than predetermined, the pressure chamber serves as a tank so that the air of stabilized pressure can be supplied to each of the Venturi tubes, even when there occurs fluctuation in the air consumption amount due to the supply of pulsing high pressure air as well as to the air leakage, whereby the suction force of the suction pipe 411 is constantly maintained. According to the vacuum adsorbing device incorporated into the transmission drum of the present invention, regardless of the air leakage from one of a plurality of suction pipes, if any, as well as any actuation of other suction pipes. Since the air can always ventilate a plurality of Venturi tubes, the movable parts such as a valve mechanism which is accurately actuated are not needed, although the conventional type utilizing the vacuum air source needs them, thereby producing the effects of reducing the probability of trouble as much as possible. Furthermore, compared with the conventional adsorbing device using the vacuum source, the adsorbing device of the present invention compensates higher running cost for maintaining a constant high degree of vacuum with a comparatively economical obtainability of the high pressure air by the compressor, etc., and additionally reduce the necessity of repair so that it has a marked characteristic of maintaining all its parts at low running cost. Fig. 27 shows a further embodiment of an transmitting drum by means of which the accessary article can be transferred to the packaging container and can be obliquely adhered thereto. In the drawing the symbol C is a long and narrow strip of continuous package comprising two sheets of synthetic resin film C1 and C2 through the clearance of which the spoons are, as shown in fig. 29, inserted so that the prescribed parts of these films are welded, thereby containing the spoons S adapted to be conveyed at a pitch equivalent to the small bag, while being sucked from a feed correcting device not shown to a package supplementing drum 51 which turns clockwise intermittently.K is a cutter for separating the small bag B from the long and narrow strip of continuous package C at every pitch. 1 is a bucket wheel for conveying the food packaging container P as shown in fig. 30 to the position at which the small bag B containing the spoon is adhered to said container P, its rotating shafts, upper and lower, which are parallel with the driving shaft of the above mentioned package supplementing drum 51 in front of a base plate, rotating clockwise. This bucket wheel 1, possessing parts buckets for receiving the packaging container in odd number, adsorbs successively the packaging containers one by one, when they are conveyed under the bucket wheel 1 by a conveyor, reaching just below the bucket wheel, and after that is rotated, the adsorption of them being released at the location of having performed the corresponding last adsorption so that they are to be successively discharged on the conveyor. In the area at the side part of the bucket wheel 1 and more specifically the part fronting the passage along which the packaging containerrotatively passes, a hot melt gun H for spraying hot melt adhesive to the side face of the packaging container is provided. After the packaging container P is adsorbed on the part bucket for receiving the packaging container P of the bucket wheel 1, during the intermediate course through which the packaging container P reaches the upper adhering position of the small bag containing the spoon by means of the clockwise rotation of the bucket wheel 1, the hot melt adhesive is sprayed to the side face P1, of the packaging container P by the hot melt gun H, and subsequently the small bag containing the spoon which is transferred down by a drum for transferring package 53, referred to in the below part, which is provided obliquely with regard to the base plate and between the package supplementing drum 51 and the bucket wheel 1, is in contact with the packaging container P so that said small bag is shifted to be adhered to the side face of the packaging container P. The drum for transferring package 53, provided between the package supplementing drum 51 and the bucket wheel 1, which is rotated synchronously with both the units so as to change the direction of the small bag, has the direction of its rotating shaft made an inclination equal to 1 2 of the inclining angle J, at which the small bag B is adhered obliquely on the diagonal direction of the side face P1 of the packaging container P, as shown in Fig. 28, with regard to the axial directions of both two axes of the abovementioned package supplementing drum 51 and the bucket wheel 1, on the flat face parallelwith these two axes.A pair of suction pipes 53a are provided at the locations which divide the external periphery of the drum for transferring package 53 into three equal parts in a manner that their inclining angle with regard to the shaft of said drum for transferring package 53 becomes 1 2 ctso that they may fall in line with the surface including the axial line of the above mentioned package supplementing drum 51 and the bucket wheel 1, when they move upward. The adsorbing force of the package supplementing drum 51 is smaller than that of the above mentioned suction pipe 53a. Next, the actuation of the device which carries out the present invention will be described as follows As shown in fig. 27, the long and narrow strip of packageC, in which the small bag B containing the spoon is packed, is adsorbed its end by the external periphery of the package supplementing drum 51, having numerous suction holes on its surface, which intermittently rotates clockwise and, while having its feed pitch corrected by the feed correcting device not shown , it is fed one pitch by the external peripheral part of the package supplementing drum 51 whose peripheral speed is more rapid than the feeding speed of the long and narrow strip of package C so that after reaching the predetermined position, the small bag B contained therein is cut out and subsequently each of the cut bags is carried downward by the rotation of the package supplementing drum 51. When the small bag B reaches the lower end, the suction pipes 53a for adsorbing said small bag provided at the locations, which divide the external periphery of the drum for transferring the package under rotation in synchronism with the package supplementing drum 51 into three equal parts, reaches the upper end of its rotating locus, i.e. the small bag shifting position. At that time since the adsorbing force of the package supplementing drum 51 against the small bag B is smaller than that of the suction pipe 53a of the drum for transferring the small bag 53, the small bag B is taken away from the package supplementing drum 51 and is adsorbed on the suc tiow pipe 53a of the drum for transferring package 53. The small bag B which was adsorbed on the suction pipe 53a then reaches the position at the bottom edge when the drum for transferring the package completes a 1800 rotation so that the small bag B inclines, as shown in fig. 28, by ot 2 X 2 4 for the primary position of adsorbing it, i.e.by the inclining angle kin the side face P1 of the package container P. On the other hand the package container P is adsorbed from the conveyor to the bucket of the bucket wheel 1, moves rotatively upward, during the intermediate course of which the hot melt adhesive is sprayed on the side face P1 of the package container P by the hot melt gun H and subsequently when the small bag B which was adsorbed on the suction pipe reaches the bottom edge, the package container P comes up to the top of its rotating locus so that the side face P1 of the package container P and the small bag B are contacted to each other, whereby the small bag B is taken away from the suction pipe 53a by the adhesive on the package container, being transferred to be adhered to the package container P.That is, the small bag B is adhered obliquely on the diagonal of the side face P1 of the.package container P. At that time it is preferable to perform steadily the adhesion by a counter member which presses the small bag B, while moving in synchronism with the motion of the small bag. Thus, the package container P to which the small bag B is adhered is conveyed downward, while being still adsorbed to the bucket of the bucket wheel 1, reaching the lowest position, and the condition in which the package container is adsorbed to the suction pipe is released, subsequently the package container being conveyed along the conveyor after having fallen thereon. As clearly described above, since the method of the present invention can continuously adherethe small bag B obliquely to the package container P only by means of making an inclination by 1 2 ofcc at which the small bag B is adhered to the package container P in providing the drum for transferring package 53, which transfers the bag B to the.package container P, between the package supplementing drum 51 and the bucket wheel 1 for forwarding the package container, the device which takes a complicated motion to adhere the small bag obliquely to the package container is not needed and there are possibilities not only of making the formation of the surface flat only with the necessity of arranging the rotational article on one surface but of realizing the structure which is in a solid state. For this reason since one surface of the base plate can be used for t he place where the food is handled, whereas another surface back surface thereof is formed to serve as driving part, the method according to the present invention has an advantage of being easy to form so that its part for handling the food may be washable. Further effect of the device is to increase the disposing speed, because the adhering mechanism simply comprises rotational motion. Fig. 31 shows the apparatus according to the invention using the transmission device of fig. 27. The continuous packages which are taken up around a reel, are kept to be drawn out in succession as shown in fig. 31, during the process of which they are cut out into each of packages B by the cutter K, and this package B is transmitted by the transmitting drum 53. On the other hand, under this transmitting drum 53, the package container P is fed out by the rotation of the bucket wheel 1. At the position where the package container P faces up to the packageB, the package B is adhered to the package container P. During the conveyance caused by the rotation of the bucket wheel 1, hot melt adhesive has been already applied to the external face of the package container P by adhesive applicator H, the package B being pressed against said applied adhesive, whereby the adhering process is much more facilitated. The package contact bonding device F is provided at this adhering position which is sandwiched by the transmitting drum 53 and the bucket wheel 1. This package contact bonding device F is, as shown in figs. 32 and 33, basically constituted by an actuating article 61 which is provided eccentrically with regard to a shaft a and..fhe pushed plate 62 mounted on.the top end of said actuating article 61. Except for this shaft a, the shaft b and c, which are in parallel with each other, are provided, one lever 63 being laid over the distance between these shafts b and c. The end of another lever 64 is freely mounted on the shaft c, the top end of said lever 64 being freely mounted on the shaft d provided on the top end of the above mentioned actuating article 61. A cam lever 65 is firmly mounted on the above mentioned shaft b, while being opposite to the fixing position of the lever 63, said cam lever 65 adapting its end to be in mesh with the cam 66 provided on the shaft e other than the abovementioned shafts a to d. The shafts a and e and the shaft f of the bucket wheel 1 are interlocked with each other. As one example of such an arrangement, as shown in fig. 34, it is exemplified that a gear 67a is firmly mounted on the shaft a, said gear 67a is engaged through the intermediate gear 69 with the gear 68e firmly mounted on the shaft e, the shaft e is firmly equipped with the wheel 610e, one belt is hung between said wheel 610e and the wheel 611g firmly mounted on the shaft g which is provided near to the shaft f, the gear 613g is firmly mounted on the shaft g and said gear 613g is engaged through the intermediate gear 615 with the gear 614f firmly mounted on the shaft f. The foregoing composition adapts the shaft a to take a rotational motion clockwise of fig. 34 in interlocking with a rotational motion in arrow direction of the same drawing of the shaft f of the bucket wheel 1 so that the actuating unit 61 takes an eccentric motion. On the other hand, the rotational motion in arrow direction of fig. 34 clockwise causes the cam 66 firmly mounted on the shaft e to take a rotational motion and the cam lever 65 engaged with said cam 66 is vibratingly moved with the shaft b being a center. In response to this motion, the shaft b takes a rotational motion clockwise or counterclockwise of fig. 34, the lever 63 firmly mounted on said shaft b and the lever 64 laid between the shaft c on the top end of said lever 63 and the shaft d on the top side of the actuating article 61 are interlocked with each other, the interactive motion of which actuates the pushed plate 2 fixed to the top end of the actuating article 61. Therefore, said pushed plate 62 is adapted to describe such a locus as shown in fig. 35. The length of the circumference of this locus is obtained by dividing by an integral number the interval between the package container shown by chain line Eo of fig. 35 on the circumference of the bucket wheel and the package container shown by the full line E1 of the same figure, in other words, the interval between the adhering work by the bucket wheel 1. Such a length intends to reduce the working range of the pushed plate 62 as much as possible. Since the pushed plate 62, which always continues to be actuated, does not need to perform the adhering work, when the package container which is fed out by the rotation of the bucket wheel 1 is located at the position shown by the chain line Eo of fig. 35, the pushed plate 62 is adapted to describe the locus t 1 and not to be in contact with the external periphery thereof. Since there is a necessity of performing the adhering work, when the package container is located at the position shown by the full line E1 of fig. 35, the pushed plate 62 is adapted to describe locus R 2 and to 2 be in contact with the external periphery of the bucket wheel 1, pressing the external end face of the package container P.At that case approximately horizontal straight line part Z 3 is adapted to exist in a manner of appearing on the part of the locus 22. . Such arrangement intends to actuate the pushed 2 plate 62 in tangential direction of the bucket wheel 1.Furthermore, the pushed plate 62 is adapted to be actuated at the speed approximately identical to the peripheral velocity of the bucket wheel 1. Thus, when it is not needed to perform the adhering work, the pushed plate 62 is adapted to be actuated without being in contact with the external periphery of the bucket wheel 1, whereas when it is needed to perform the adhering work, the pushed plate 62 may be adapted to act as the contact bonding device. At that time the actuating direction of the pushed plate 62 is the tangential one of the bucket wheel 1 and its speed is made approximately identical to the peripheral velocity of the bucket wheel t. If the arrangement is made as stated above, when housing the package container P in the receiving part provided on the external periphery of the bucket wheel 1 and adhering the package B to the package container P, while rotating the bucket wheel 1, the package put on the package container P is contact banded to the package container P which is under re moval without being scrubbed by the above mentioned pushed plate 62. In other words, since the pushed plate 62 takes such a special motion as stated above, the pressing position of the pushed plate 62 against the package B, i.e. the actuating point of the pushed plate 62 does not slip in spite of the motion of the package container P. For this reason, the pushed plate 62 performs pressing process without scrubbing the package B. According to the present invention, without using any complicated electric signal, only a mechanical combination causes the pushed plate 62 and the rotational unit to be synchronous with each other with extreme simplicity. Since the pushed plate 62 is actuated in the tangential direction of the rotational unit and at the same time is actuated at the speed approximately identical to the peripheral velocity of the rotational unit, the state of adhering the article to be adhered is stable, and derailing of the article to be adhered out of the package container does not take place. Furthermore, since it is possible to minimize the actuating range of the pushed plate 62, the installation of the present device may be performed at the place where the space available is extremely limited, all the measurements of the adhering device being able to be made as small as possible. Although the foregoing embodiment has described the case of adhering the article to be adhered to the package container, the application of the present invention is not limited to such a case, but it may be practically used for adhering the article to be adhered to goods other than the package container.
