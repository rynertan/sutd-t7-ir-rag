# Method and apparatus for generating and processing television signals for viewing in three dimensions and moving holograms.

## Abstract
Apparatus for generating and processing television TV signals of a visual scene for viewing in three dimensions, comprises a conventional TV camera, including three sepa rate color video tubes, each camera tube adapted to receive light of a different one of the three primary colors. Each cam era tube is aligned with one of three optical axes which are nominally parallel, and are spaced apart a selected distance in a horizontal plane. At least one of the first and third axes is rotatable so that it can be turned through a small angle in such a direction as to intersect the second and third axes at selected distances in front of the camera. Synchronizing beams are provided for two sub rasters in scanning of the camera tubes. During a first scan, the first primary color signal from the first camera tube is muted, and on the second sub raster, the third camera tube output carrying a primary color signal is muted. When the transmitter signal is received and displayed on a TV receiver and is viewed through a pair of eye glasses, in which one glass passes the first primary color and the other glass passes the third primary color, the visual scene will be seen in three dimensional viewing.
