# CABLE BLOCKING

## Abstract
A gas tight block is provided in multiconductor cables by separating a plurality of inner conductors in the centre region of the cable from the outer conductors in the outer region of the cable, applying a hot melt adhesive or a gel around each of the inner conductors, installing a first recoverable polymeric sleeve around the inner conductors, arranging the outer conductors around the circumference of the installed sleeve. Additional concentric sleeves can be installed over repeated layers of conductors in cables having a large number of conductors. The resulting blocked cable can be used in hazardous areas where migration of gases from a hazardous area must be prevented.
