# Arrangement for monitoring and controlling the extent and direction of movement of a forms feed assembly in a printer sub system cooperating with a data processing system.

## Abstract
The arrangement according to the invention is provided with facilities for detecting emitter changes that have occur red during operating intervals. in a typical operation, a mic roprocessor 210 initiates a command to a moving assembly 170 , such as a forms feed assembly, then once the operation is initiated the microprocessor transfers to other respon sibilities, meanwhile periodically checking the status of the forms feed assembly. The forms feed assembly supplies emit ter signals to the processor which are utilized by the microp rocessor to determine whether or not any emitter changes have occurred during the intervals between the checking operations. The microprocessor has a stored data table and logic responsive to emitter signal conditions that had previ ously occurred WAS and that is further responsive to emitter signals that are presently occurring IS to supply an output in numbers of emitters indicative of both the extent and direc tion of movement of the assembly during the intervening interval.
