# Dielectric electrode laminate.

## Abstract
A dielectric electrode laminate comprises a mica sheet 171 , and a metallic sheet electrode 175 bonded to a face of the mica sheet 171 by a layer of pressure sensitive adhesive 173 . The mica sheet 171 may have an electrode bonded to each side, each electrode 174, 175 being cutaway in a bar like pattern. A method of fabricating a dielectric electrode laminate is also described, comprising coating the mica sheet 171 with a layer of pressure sensitive adhesive, bonding a metallic sheet to the mica sheet 171 and selectively removing portions of the electrode sheet to create an electrode pattern.
