## Description
DEVICE FOR RECEIVING CARTRIDGES AND CARTRIDGES THEREFOR This invention relates to a device for receiving cartridges containing test elements, and to such cartridges. Chemical analyzers have been developed for performing quantitative analyses of samples of biological fluids, such as blood serum, to enable the physician to obtain a more complete picture of a person s physical condition. Recent developments have provided test elements in essentially planar, dry form which can be loaded into a cartridge adapted to be removably mounted in an analyzer. In the use of the analyzer, a test element is fed from a cartridge into a metering station where a predetermined amount of sample fluid is deposited on the test element. The element is then moved to a read station where a change in the test element is sensed, the amount of change being proportional to the concentration of a particular analyte in the sample fluid. The test element is used only once and is discarded after the reading has been taken.An analyzer for use with test elements of this type is described in U.S. PatentNo. 4151931. Cartridges of the type described above are normally loaded with test elements for performing a single test, for example an analysis of the concentration of sodium ions in blood serum. The cartridges must be generally uniform in size and shape, regardless of the type of test element which they contain, since each of the cartridges must fit into cartridge suppcrt structure of fixed dimensions. Thus, there is a problem that a cartridge containing the wrong type of element for the test desired may be inserted in the analyzer, particularly in a busy laboratory where . ey samples are analyzed daily. This, of course, results in erroneous test results and in a loss of valuable time when the analyses must be performed under emergency conditions. It is an object of one aspect of the present invention to overcome the above mentioned problem in a device for receiving a cartridge containing test elements of one. of a plurality of types, the device including means for receiving a cartridge and being intended to operate with a cartridge having a code indicative of the type of the elements it contains. According to this one aspect of the invention such a device is characterized by adjustable discriminator means for cooperation with the code of the cartridge to allow or prevent receipt of a cartridge according to the form of the code and the condition of the discriminator means. The condition of the discriminator means is adjustable so that the type of the elements in a cartridge which is received can be governed. In furtherarce of the object of overcoming the above mentioned problem, another aspect of the present invention provides a cartridge containing test elements and receivable in a device for employing the test elements The device has adjustable discriminator means for cooperation with a tActile code on the cartridge to allow or prevent receipt of a cartridge in the device. The cartridge is characterized in that the tactile code is indicative of the type of test elements in the cartridge and that the tactile code is one of a plurality of tactile codes present one on each of a range of similar cartridges and each being indicative of the type of test elements present in the cartridge of which it is part. A further aspect of the present invention provides a cartridge containing test elements of one of a plurality of types in combination with a device for employing said test elements, characterized in that the device has adjustable discriminator means which is adjustable to cooperate with a code on the cartridge to allow receipt of the cartridge in the device, the code being one of a plurality of codes present one on each of a range of similar cartridges each code being indicative of the type of test elements present in the cartridge of which it is part. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a reagent supply station of a chemical analyzer, showing a cartridge support means and a cartridge discriminator, including a first form of sensing wheel, constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing a cartridge positioned for insertion into the cartridge chamber of an analyzer Fig. 2a is a diagrammatic fragmentary plan view of the chamber into which the cartridge is to be inserted Fig. 3 is an exploded view of a cartridge, showing the cartridge casing, a test element stack, and a stack positioning element Fig. 4 is a perspective view of another form of sensing wheel included in a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 5 is an elevational view, partially in section, of the cartridge support means in combination with the sensing wheel shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a partial view with parts broken away for the sake of illustration, of a third embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 7 is a sectional view taken generally on the line VII VII in Fig. 6 when the cartridge is in its nest. The invention is described hereinafter in connection with an analyzer for performing quantitative chemical analyses of biological fluids, such as blood serum. The invention is particularly useful with potentiometric analyzers in which case the substrate which makes the test possible comprises a pair of electrodes selective to the ion activity of choice.Recent developments have provided these electrodes in essentially planar, dry form, suitable for use in pairs in an analyzer. The invention can also be employed in an analyzer using a radiometric detector which will read a suitable substrate incorporating, for example, reagents that create a dye in proportion to concentration of the analyte being measured. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is shown in Fig. 1 a test element supply station of an analyzer which includes a cartridge support means lO. sStpport means 10 comprises walls b3 which define a chamber 11 for receiving a cartridge 12 containing test elements for use in the analyzer. As will be described in more detail hereinafter, a cartridge discrimindtar 14 is adapted to interact with a code means 16 on cartridge 12 to ensure that only a cartridge containing the proper test elements is installed on the analyzer. As shown in the exploded view in Fig. 3, the cartridge 12 is generally rectangular in cross section and is formed from a pair of casing sections 18 and 20 which are permanently sealed together to enclose a stack of test elements 22 each of which contains the reagents necessary for performing a selected test.Test elements 22 are adapted to be sequentially fed from cartridge 12 by a transfer means having a push blade 24, shown in phantom in Fig. 3, which enters through a slot 26 and forces a test element 22 in a dispensing position out of the cartridge 12 through an exit slot not shown . A stack positioning element 28 bears against the lowermost test element 22 in the stack and is biased upwardly by a spring loaded plunger 30, shown in phantom in Fig. 3, which extends into the cartridge 12 through an aperture 31 in its bottom wall.Stack Positioning element 28 comprises a pair of pawls 32 on opposite sides thereof which are adapted to engage ratchet teeth 34 to prevent movement of the test elements 22 downwardly away from the dispensin position. To ensure proper orientation of cartridge 12 in chamber 11, cartridge casing section 18 is provided with a pair of vertical rails 36, 38 and casing section 20 is provided with vertical rails 39, 40 which are spaced more closely than rails 36, 38. As shown in Fig. 2A, chamber 11 is provided with channels 42 and 44 the channel 44 being narrower than channel 42 so that it can accept only the more closely spaced rails 39, 40, and not the more widely spaced rails 36, 38. This arrangement in addition to the non square, rectangular sectional shape of the cartridge 12 prevents insertion of the cartridge 12 in the chamber 11 in any orientation other than that required. The rails 36, 38, 39, 40 cooperating with walls 36a, 38a, 39a, 40a, respectively, also serve to accurately control the position of the cartridge 12 during insertion and while in the chamber 11. Cartridge 12 is secured in the chamber 11 by means of a hinged cover member not shown . The type of test element 22 contained in cartridge 12 is indicated by code means 16 on the cartridge 12. Code means 16 comprises a web 49 having tactile discontinuities thereon in the form of a notch, as shown at 47. Each of the types of test elements is assigned a unique notch code, the different codes being formed by varying the location of the notch 47. Although the code means 16 is shown as having only one notch 47 in respect of each notch code a plurality of notches 47 could in fact be used in respect of each notch code. Test elements 22 suitable for use in the device and cartridge of the subject invention are disclosed inU.S. Patents Nos. 4,053,381 and 3,992,158. Cartridge discriminator 14 Fig. 1 is provided to ensure that only a cartridge 12 containing test elements 22 for a selected analyte can be installed on the analyzer. Cartridge discriminator 14 comprises a sensing wheel 50 which includes a central hub 51 and projections 66 extending radially from the hub.Sensing wheel 50 is carried on a shaft 52 journalled in supports 54, 56, in the analyzer. Sensing wheel 50 is adjustable to five angular positions by a control means which includes a control knob 58 mounted on shaft 52. The projections 66 are circumferentially and axially positioned on hub 51 such that, in each of the angular positions of wheel 50, a different combination, or pattern, of projections 66 extends into chamber 11 and is in a position to interact with code means 16 on cartridge 12. Thus, as shown in Fig. 1, a projection 66 at one axial end 53 of central hub 51 is positioned such that nly a cartridge 12 having a notch 47 in the position shown could be installed in chamber 11. Control knob 58 has a plurality of faces 59, only one of which is visible to the operator at any one time. The face 59 which is in the visible, or up, position in Fig. 1 s marked with the symbol K for potassium, indicating that the apparatus is programmed for a potassium test as will be explained hereinafter, and that sensing wheel 50 is positioned to permit insertion of a cartridge 12 having a code means 16 corresponding to potassium test elements. In a like manner, when the face 59,labelled Na for sodium, is moved to the up position, the apparatus will be conditioned for a sodium analysis.A detent 60 is provided to position knob 58 and to precisely locate wheel 50 relative to the chamber 11 in each of its angular positions detent 60 comprises a leaf spring 63 having an indentation 65 which is adapted to releasably receive protuberances 67 on the control knob 58.A ratchet wheel 62 cooperates with a pawl 64 to provide an anti backup device for control knob 58 thus, as shown in Fig. 1, knob 58 can only be rotated in a counterclockwise direction. Ratchet wheel 62 and pawl 64 also function to prevent rotation of shaft 52 when an attempt is made to insert a cartridge 12 containing the wrong type of test elements 22 into chamber 11. With reference to Fig. 1, it will be seen that a torque on shaft 52 in a clockwise direction is created when a web 49 is moved down into abutment with a projection 66 clockwise movement of shaft 52 is prevented by ratchet wheel 62 and pawl 64, and hence, further insertion of cartridge 12 is not possible. A detector 70 is provided to sense the position of shaft 52, the shaft position being indicative of the particular test selected by the operator, and to transmit the test selection to the analyzer computer not shown . Detector 70 could take the form of an encoder wheel and a photo electric detector, or it could be a set of switches which are coupled to logic circuitry. Information stored in the.computer for the particular test selected will be utilized in processing the data produced by the test. By having the cartridge discriminator 14 located adjacent the mouth of the chamber 11 and by having the code means 16 located adjacent the leading end of the cartridge 12, prevention of insertion of a wrong type of cartridge 12 will occur very early in the movement of the cartridge 12 into the chamber 11. Hence it will be blatantly apparent that there is an error. The cooperation of the rails 36, 38, 39, 40 with the walls 36a, 38a, 39a, 40a, serves to ensure that the position of the cartridge 12 and hence of a notch 47 in the web 49, is accurately determined as the web 49 approaches the cartridge discriminator 14 upon an attempt being made to insert the cartridge 12. A second embodiment of the invention is, in all respects except that of the form of the sensing wheel, identical to the first embodiment described above. Accordingly only the sensing wheel will be described below. For an understanding of other aspects of the second embodiment reference should bemade to the description and illustrations of the first embodiment. In the second embodiment a sensing wheel 150, illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, is included instead of the sensing wheel 50. Sensing wheel 150 mounted on shaft 52, is of generally polygonal cross sectional form and comprises a plurality of generally planar surfaces 151 having projections 166 formed thereon. Each projection 166 is adapted to cooperate with a notch 47 in the web 49 of a cartridge 12 in the same manner as described previously for projections 66. Wheel 150 can be modded, or projections 166 can be formed by a machine operation.One particular advantage in the use of sensing wheel 150 is that the wheel 150 cannot be rotated when a cartridge 12 is. installed in chamber 11, because of the length of the projections 166. SeeFig. 5. Thus, the control knob 58 setting cannot be accidentally changed when a cartridge 12 is installed in the analyzer. In operation of the first and second embodiments, control knob 58 is first moved to position a face 59 bearing the notation for the desired test, in the up position, e.g. Ror potassium as shown in Fig. 1. Next, a cartridge 12 containing test elements 22 for performing the desired test is inserted in chamber 11. If the proper cartridge 12 is selected, the code means 16 on the cartridge 12 will be located such that the projection s 66 or 166 on the sensing wheel 50 or 150 will pass through the notch es 47, and the cartridge 12 will move intbthe position shown in Fig. 1. If the wrong cartridge 12 is selected, web 49 will abut against the projectio 66 or 166 and the cartridge 12 will not move to the loaded position. It will be apparent from the foregoing description that embodiments of the invention are particularly suitable for ensuring that only test elements appropriate for a desired test are installed on the analyzer and that the analyzer is properly programmed for the selected tests. Thus, costly mistakes, resulting from loading the analyzer with reagents which do not conform to a desired test, can be avoided. A single channel analyzer can be con ditioned to accept cartridges bearing a number of different notch codes. Further, a plurality of identical channels, each having a cartridge discriminator 14 can be combined to form a multi channel analyzer capable of simultaneously performing different tests. Use of the same components in each channel greatly facilitates the manufacture and repair of such a multi channel analyzer. A third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7. This third embodiment is intended for cooperation with a cartridge substantially the same as that already described herein, except that it has two webs 49. Therefore, there will be no repetition of the description of the cartridge 12. Only those features of the third embodiment which differ from the first and second embodiments will now be described. Features which are structurally and or functionally the same as features in the first and or second embodiment will be given the same reference numeral but with the addition of a prime s suffix. For an understanding of features not described in this third embodiment reference should be made to the foregoing description and Figs. 1 to 5 herein. In this third embodiment the cartridge discriminator consists of pins 301 received in bores 303 in walls 13 of the cartridge support means 10 .In the embodiment illustrated there are three bores 303a,b,c aligned with the three possible sites of notches 4r in the web 49a and there are three bores 303d,e,f, aligned with the three possible sites of notches 49 in the web 49b. The web 49a is disposed between the rails 36 and 38t, and the web 49b is disposed between the rails 3 and 40 . The pins 301 are long enough so that when inserted into bores 303 they extend from the inner surface of the walls 131 and into the path of an unnotched web 49 as the cartridge is inserted into its chamber 11 . Thus, any one pin 301 will prevent full and proper insertion of a cartridge 12 into the chamber 11 unless a notch 47 is aligned with that pin 301. Let it be assumed that the operator wishes to perform tests for potassium. He will set up the apparatus so that only test elements 22 appropriate for potassium tests can be supplied to the apparatus. Let it further be assumed that cartridges containing test elements for potassium tests have a notch 4 in the middle of web 49a and a notch 47 adjacent rail 39 as is illustrated in Fig. 7 . The operator will insert a pin 301 in bore 303b and a pin in bore 303d. The. ends of such pins will not prevent in sertion of a cartridge containing potassium test elements 22 because the notches 47 will allow the pin ends to pass relatively through the webs 49a and 49b. However, any location of the notches 47 other than that shown will cause interference between a web or the webs and a pin or the pins and hence prevent full and proper insertion of the cartridge 12 . The operator will notice that full insertion of the cartridge 12 is prevented and will be caused to check the cartridge 12 . In Fig. 7, the cartridge is illustrated without any test elements therein and with the stackpositioning element removed, for the sake of illustration. In the first and second embodiments the cartridge discriminator 14 includes a single sensing wheel jO, 150 respectively for cooperation with code means 16, on the cartridge, 12, which includes a single web 49. It should be understood that apparatus otherwise similar to the first and second embodiments may include two sensing wheels 50, 150 for cooperation one with each of two webs 49 arranged, perhaps, in the manner of the third embodiment. As will be apparent from the above description, the third embodiment does not have some of the advantageous features of the first and second embodiments. Further alternative arrangements of the present invention include the use of a bar code which is optically read or a magnetically sensed code.
