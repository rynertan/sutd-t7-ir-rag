## Description
GRANULAR DETERGENTS CONTAINING PYROPHOSPHATE AND POLYACRYLATE POLYMER John E. Morrow Howard A. Mills, Jr. Technical Field The present Invention relates to granular detergents containing organic surfactant, pyrophosphate builder, low levels of alkali metal silicate, and a polyacrylate polymer. The compositions herein are prepared by drying an aqueous slurry comprising the components. While the compositions are preferably substantially free of orthophosphates, they can contain minor amounts of such material provided the weight ratio of pyrophosphate to orthophosphate Is at least about 5 1. Pyrophosphates are known to be potentially more efficient builders than the tripolyphosphates commonly used in detergents due to their ability to remove more calcium and magnesium ions from the laundering solution per unit of P205. They do so, however, by precipitating these ions as insoluble phosphates e,g,, dicalcium pyrophosphate whereas the tripolyphosphates retain them in solution as complex ions. These precipitates can build up on fabrics over a period of time and cause undesirable effects, such as greyness and harshness of feel, unless antiredeposition agents are added to detergents containing pyrophosphates. Pyrophosphate built granular detergents have often contained high leveis e.g., 10 by weight of alkali metal silicates to provide optimum granule structure and processing. It is believed that when a crutcher mix containing silicate is spray dried, the silicate dries to a tough film capable of cementing finely crystalline granule walls together. This results in granules having very desirable physical properties, i.e, crisp, durable and freeflowing granules. Silicates having lower SiO2 to alkali metal oxide molar ratios e.g., 1.6 2.0 are usually selected because they are more water soluble than the higher ratio silicates.However, exposure of the silicate to carbon dioxide duriny drying and storage can shift its ratio to a higher value, reducing silicate solubility and resulting in detergent granules which do not com pletely disintegrate in the laundering solution. High levels of silicate in detergents can thus cause an unacceptably high level of insoluble material being deposited on fabrics. It is apparent that there is a continuing need for the development of pyrophosphate built granular detergents having acceptable granule structure and solubility, and capable of maintaining fabric whiteness. Background Art British Patent 1,551,239, Bailey et al, published August 30, 1979, discloses various polycarboxylate materials, including polyacrylates, as antiredeposition agents for detergents containing orthophosphate and pyrophosphate in a weight ratio of from about 9 2 to 3 7. U.S. Patent 4,019,998, Benson et al, issued April 26, 77, discloses granular detergents containing ophosphate and difficult soluble silQ cates . British Patent 1 ,460,893, Foster, published January 6, 1977, discloses granular detergents containing orthophosphate andlor pyrophosphate, and polyacrylates as anti redeposition agents. European patent application 82200458.6 discloses the use of film forming polymers, including polyacrylates, as structural aids to replace all or part of the silicate in low phosphate granular detergents containing aluminosilicates. Summary of the Invention The present invention encompasses a granular detergent composition comprising a from about 5 to about 50 by weight of an organic surfactant selected frown the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, ampholytic and cationic surfactants, and mixtures thereof b from about 5 to about 80 by weight of an alkali metal pyrophosphate builder c from about 0.5 to about 6 by wight of an alkali metal silicate having a molar ratio of SiO2 to alkali metal oxide of from about 1.0 to about 3.2 and d from about t.196 to about 5 by weight of a polyacrylate polymer soluble in an aqueous slurry comprising the above components and having a weight average molecular weight of from about 2,000 to about 200,000 said composition prepared by drying an aqueous slurry comprising the above components, and the amount of orthophosphate in said composition being limited such that the weight ratio of pyrophosphate to orthophosphate is at least about 5 1. Detailed Description of the invention The granular detergent compositions of the present invention contain, as essential components, an organic surfactant, a pyrophosphate builder, an alkali metal silicate and a polyacrylate polymer. The polyacrylate polymer acts as both a highly effective anti redeposition agent and structural aid, allowing for the formulation of granular detergents having desirable structure, solubility and whiteness maintenance characteristics. The amount of orthophosphate in the compositions should be limited such that the weight ratio of pyrophosphate to orthophosphate is at least about 5 1, preferably at least about 10 1, and more preferably at least about 20 1.The compositions are most preferably substantially free of orthophosphates because they tend to form coarse precipitates which more readily deposit on fabrics than the pyrophosphate precipitates. The compositions herein are prepared by drying an aqueous slurry comprising the components. The slurry generally contains from about 258 to about 508 water, whereas the dried granules initially contain from about 2 to about 10 , preferably from about 2 to about 5 , water. The drying operation can be accomplished by any convenient means, such as by using spray drying towers, both counter current and co current, fluid beds, flash drying equipment, or industrial microwave or oven drying equipment. These are more fully described in U.S. Patent 4,019,998, Benson et al, issued April 26, 1977 particularly from Column 14, line 19 to Column 15, line 9 , incorporated herein by reference. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the granular detergents herein exhibit superior structure and physical properties because the polyacrylate polymer dries tE a tough, non sticky, non hygroscopic film which cements the granule walls together much in the same manner as do the silicates. The polymer film is readily water soluble so that the granules quickly disintegrate in the laundering solution and leave little or no Insoluble residue on fabrics. Moreover, the low level of silicate in the compositions contributes to the desired granule structure, and also aids processing and inhibits metal corrosion, without causing excessive Insoluble silicate deposition. Finally, the polyacrylate polymer Is also highly effective at suspending the insoluble dicalcium pyrophosphate salts, preventing their deposition and build up on fabrics. Organic Surfactant The detergent compositions herein contain from about 58 to about 508 by weight of an organic surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, ampholytic and cationle surfactants, and mixtures thereof. The surfactant preferably represents from about 10 to about 30 by weight of the detergent composition. Surfactants useful herein are listed inU.S. Patent 3,664,961, Norris, issued May 23, 1972, and in U.S.Patent 3,919,678, Laughlin, et al, Issued December 30, 197S, bothIncorporated herein by reference.

Water soluble salts of the higher fatty adds, I.e., soaps , are useful anionic surfactants in the compositions herein. This includes alkali metal soaps such as the sodium, potassium, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and preferably from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms.

Sodium silicate, particularly having a molar ratio of from about 1.8 to about 2.2, Is preferred. The alkali metal silicates can be purchased In either liquid or granular form. Silicate slurries can conveniently be used to avoid having to dissolve the dried form In the aqueous slurry e.g., crutcher minx of the components herein. Polyacrylate Polymer T.he compositions of the present invention contain from about 0.t to about 58, preferably from about 0.38 to about 3 , and more preferably from about 0.58 to about 2 , by weight of a polyacrylate polymer soluble In an aqueous slurry comprising the essential components herein.

It will be appreciated that the polymer must be at least partially soluble in the slurry of the components for it to dry to a film capable of cementing the granule walls together as the slurry is dried. For optimum granule structure and physical properties, the polymer should be substantially soluble in the slurry, and it is preferably completely soluble in the slurry.Since the slurry will generally be a strong electrolyte solution duc to the presence of the pyrophosphate and silicate salts, and, when present, anionic surfactants and other neutral or alkaline salts, optimum solubility of the polymer is obtained when it is in the form of an at least partially neutralized alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium e.g., mono , di or triethanol ammon ium salt. The alkali metal, especially sodium, salts are most preferred. Suitable polymers herein are the at least partially neutralized salts of homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid, hydroxyacrylic acid and methacrylic acid.
