# Transducer head suspension assembly.

## Abstract
A suspension assembly for a magnetic transducer head 150V includes a normally flat gimbal spring 308 in the form of a figure eight, with a pair of tabs or ears 308G at the sides of the eight by means of which the spring is mounted in a sup port arm 104V. A backup spring, 310 has legs 310D and 310E extending from a mounting side of a hole in the arm 104V towards the other side. Legs 310F and 310G extend back again and connect to a depending leg 310H and flange portion 310I effective to provide pressure on the middle of the gimbal spring 308. The backup spring 310 provides resilient backup force against translation of the transducer head on its main axis and the gimbal spring 308 provides resilience against transducer pitching and rolling.
