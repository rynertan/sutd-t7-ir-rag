# Bar code reader and method of measuring bar codes.

## Abstract
A bar code reader 10 comprises two photodetectors 44, 48 disposed a fixed distance apart. Independent circuitry 56, 58 66, 68 is connected to each photodetector to provide first and second digital signals when the photodetectors detect an edge in a bar code. As the reader 10 is scanned across the code the signals are timed and are compared in a central processing unit 76 to calculate the scanning velocity, from which the absolute spacing of the bars is determined.
