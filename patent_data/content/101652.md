# A handle.

## Abstract
An operating handle device for the operator of a remote control of a window. The device comprises a handle 10 and a slide 11 . The slide 11 has an engagement portion 12 which is adapted for sliding engagement within a guide G. The handle 10 is pivotally retained with the slide 11 such that an engagement surface 22 can engage with a surface S fixed relative to the guide G to prevent movement of the slide 11 when the handle is in a first position. By movement of the handle to a second position the engagement surface 22 is released from the fixed surface S in order to permit free sliding movement of the slide 11 along the guide G.
