## Description
Wire Connectinfr AFparatus The invention relates to apparatus for connecting wires in an electrical connector. Apparatus for connecting wires in an electrical connector comprising two housing parts relatively movable to effect the connection which apparatus comprises frame means defining a connector feed path extending to an operating station, means to feed a series of connectors in tandera relation sequentially along the path to the operating station, guide means on the frame means adapted to engage complementary guide means on one housing part to maintain the one housing part in a predetermined rotational position at the operating station and a force applying member at the operating station operable to move the other housing part relative to the one housing part thereby to effect connection to the wires according to the invention is characterised in that, the apparatus is for use with an electrical connector in which the talo housing parts are relatively rotatable to effect the connection and the force applying member is arranged to rotate the other housing part relative to the one housing part. An example of the invention will now be described with reference to the accoanpzlywng drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an electrical connector Figure 2 is a perspective view of an apparatus to connect wires in the connector Figures 3 d 4 are frayacntaxy lonitudinal crosssectional views of the apparatus before and aftcr an operating stroke and, Figure 5 is a fragmentary transverse cross sectional view of the apparatus. The wire connecting apparatus is adapted to connect wires in the electrical connector shown in Figure 1 and described in more detail in our copending application 8994 of even date to which reference is hereby made.The connector 10 comprises upper and lower insulating housing parts 11 and 13 relatively rotatable by radially extending arms 26 and 49, respectively, to urge wires 2, when inserted in passageways 23, into a slotted contact member fixed in tlle lower housing part. The upper surface of the upper housing part 12 is formed with a pair of parallel grooves 29 on each side of the mouths of the passagewas 23 and the lower surface of the lower housing part is formed with a single diametric groove 48. The wire connecting apparatus comprises a head 61 comprising a framework 62 defining a passageway providing a connector feed path 63 extending to an operating station 64. A plate member 66 defining an upper wall of the passageway is formed with two spaced parallel ribs 67 extending longitudinally and laterally offset fran the centre line of the passageway for engagement in the complementary grooves 29 on the connectors to guide the connectors along the passageway in a constant rotational position. A spigot 68 upstands from a bottom wall 69 of the passageway at an exit end of the operating station to provide a connector stop. A trigger 71 is pivotally mounted at 72 in a clevis 73 provided in ti ie iliad on one side of the connector feed path for movement relatively towards a handle 70 against the action of a compression spring 81. A bell crank lever 74 is pivotally mounted intermediate its ends on a frame extension 75. The short arm of the bell crank lever is formed with a slot 93 in which a pin 76 fixed to trigger 71 is freely located and the long arm of the bell crank lever arm extends under the connector feed path 62 into a cavity 77 provided in the head on the other side of the passageway.A pawl 78 is pivotally mounted on the free end of the long arm and biassed by spring 80 against a spigot 79 fixed in the arm defining with the bell crank lever an escapement mechanism. A flat coil spring 81 is mounted in a housing 82 mounted on the head and is adapted to provided a substantially constant biassing force irrespective of extended length. The handle 70 defines a through passageway adapted releasably to receive a connector magazine 83.The magazine is of rectangular cross section and defies a comlector receiving passageway 84 having a pair of connector guiding ribs 85 aligned with the ribs 67 in the operating head and laterally offset frail the longitudinal centre line of the passageway to provide a clearance for connector arms 26,49. The magazine has a longitudinally extending slot 86 in a lower wall receiving a hooked end 87 of the spring 81. In operation of the apparatus, a loaded magazine is inserted into handle 70 and a hooked end 87 of the spring 81 engaged with the rearmost connector 10, urging the connectors in tandem relation along the feed path to the operating station retained in a constant rotational position by guiding ribs 67 and 85. The leading connector is restrained from movement beyond the exit end of the operating station by engagement with spigot 68. The wires are then inserted through slot 87 in plate member 66 into the connector. Operation of the trigger in the position shown in Figure 3 causes the pawl to engage arm 49 rotating the lower housing part relative to the upper housing part urging the slotted contact member against the wires to splice then electrically together. The rotation of the lower housing part brings groove 48 into alignment with spigot 68 permitting ejection of the leading connector from the exit end of the operating station Figure 4 .Release of the trigger pennits return of the pawl which rides over the arm 49 as a result of flexure of spring 80 permitting advancement of the next leading connector by the spring 81 along the feed path to the operating position.
