## Abstract
A post designed for sign or guide marker use having sufficient longitudinal rigidity to withstand a force driving it into the ground and sufficient elastic character to permit nondestructive deformation upon impact by a moving object, with subsequent restoration to an original, upright position. Various construction materials and or structural configurations are disclosed for obtaining this dual character without incurring high production and material cost. By employing a structural configuration whose moment of inertia decreases due to deformation at a cross section, post flexibility improves to preclude sheering during impact.
