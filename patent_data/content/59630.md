# Field programmable device.

## Abstract
A field programmable device has word lines W₁,W₂,W₃ , crossing bit lines B₁,B₂,B₃ , and memory cells M₁₁,M₁₂,M₂₁,M₂₂ each connected to a bit line and a word line. Outflow of current through parasitic P N P N elements Tr₁, Tr₂ is prevented by voltage supply means diodes Da and resistors Ra for supplying sufficiently high voltage to non selected word lines. Leakage of current through parasitic P N P transistors Tr₃ of already written cells is also prevented by voltage supply means for supplying sufficiently high voltage diode Da to word lines W₁,W₂,W₃ .
