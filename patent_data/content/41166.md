## Description
This invention relates to a didactical device for playing on musical instruments. As is known, it is mainly on toy musical instruments that are currently utilized color coded keys or elements which can be manipulated in accordance with a written musical text where the notes are designated with either dots or markings of the same colors as the keys to be depressed. This currently used method enables even the smallest ones to perform melodies without any actual knowledge of music. The method, while being suitable for toy musical instruments is not, of course, applicable, for a number of reasons, to traditional musical instruments. Thus, it is a primary object of the invention to provide a didactical device which enables, beginners in particular, to readily locate the keys to be depressed in order to obtain a given musical accord. A further object of this invention is to provide a didactical device which, within a small size, affords the representation of a high number of musical accords for effectuation also on different musical instruments. It is another object of the invention to provide a didactical device which is extremely simple construction wise, and can be referred to in an extremely convenient and ready way. Yet another object of this invention is to provide a didactical device which can be easily made from materials and elements which are readily available commercially, and is of reduced cost. Such objects are achieved by the device as claimed. Further features and advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed . description of a didactical device for playing on musical instruments, as illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 shows schematically and in perspective the device according to this invention Figure 2 is an exploded view of the device, evidencing the components thereof and Figure 3 is a side view of the device. With reference to the drateng figures, this didactical device for playing on musical instruments, which is generally indicated at 1, comprises a first plate like element 2, which is of preference but not of necessity formed in a substantially circular configuration. On either faces of said first plate like element 2, there are provided a plurality of areas 3 having symbols 4 designating the musical notes, and a plurality of areas 5 having markings 6 designating the musical instrument keys to be operated. Advantageously, the cited areas 3 and 5 are intercalated and arranged along a peripheral annulus of the faces of the plate like element 2. Concentrically to the areas 3 and 5, there are advantageously provided a further plurality of areas, indicated at 10, which have further markings 11 for playing on a different musical instrument, e.g. a guitar. Internally to the areas 10 and concentrically thereto, there are provided a plurality of areas or zones 12 which carry graphical symbols 13 showing the accord corresponding to the musical notes designated by the symbols 4. At either faces of the first plate like element 2, there are overlaid two second plate like elements, indicated at 20, which are provided with a first collimation window 21, preferably formed with lines 22 simulating a pentagraph, which is available at the areas 3 having symbols 4 corresponding to the various notes. On the plate like elements 20, there is correspondingly provided a sighting window 25 which carries a pattern or theme 26 simulating the keys of a piano and is located at an area or zone 5 carrying the markings corresponding to the keys to be operated. Advantageously, said markings include first markings corresponding to the keys to be operated with the left hand, and second markings corresponding to the keys to be operated with the right hand. Also on the second plate like element 20, a second sighting window 30 is provided which is arranged at the areas 12 having graphical symbols 13 representative of the accord corresponding to the notes positioned at the first window 21. On the plate like element 20, there is provided a further sighting window 40, whereon lines 41 are provided which correspond to the cords of a guitar, which window is positioned at the areas 10 with the further markings 11 corresponding to the cords to be pinched to perform the cited accord on a guitar. The second plate like elements 20 are mutually movable relatively to the first plate like element 2, thereby the first collimation window and second collimation window are brought on the accord and related musical notes to be performed. The coupling of the first plate like element 2 and second platelike elements 20, in the embodiment shown in the drawings, is accomplished by mutual rotation, and for this purpose, a central pivot pin 50 is provided which unites together the various plate like elements, with mutual movement capabilities. Of course, the same principle would remain unaffected where the. relative movement between the second plate like element 20 and first plate lie element 2, instead of being a rotary one, is a translatory one in this case, however, the construction would change somewhat, and the plate like element having the cited areas 3 and 5 could be given a rectangular configuration, with the second plate like element in the form of a slide which can be translated to bring it to collimate with the musical accord to be performed. It should be added to the foregoing that the visible surface of the second plate like element 20 is preferably provided with illustrations or symbols representing the keyboard of a piano, musical notes, or other elements consistent with the intended use of the inventive device. The use of the device according to this invention is apparent from the foregoing description it will be sufficient for the user to bring the second collimation window 30 to the accord he she wishes to perform, such that at the first window 21 there appearthe markings which designate the piano keys or guitar chords to be operated in order to obtain that accord. It should be further noted that, below the first window 21 and in radial alignment therewith, there may be provided an additional window for reading low notes, as correspondingly provided on the first platelike element 2. moreover, the areas or zones 12 may carry, in addition to the graphical symbol 13 of the accord, a r eference numeral of the accord, thus simplifying the writing of harmonic sequences to be optionally applied on the plate like element 26, which can be written, therefore,, as a simple numerical succession. It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular the fact is stressed herein that, within extremely reduced dimensions, it enables the inclusion of a very high number of musical accords of simple and quick readability. In practicing the invention, the materials used, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any ones to meet individual requirements.
