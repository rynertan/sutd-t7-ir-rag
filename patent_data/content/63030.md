# Pressure cookers.

## Abstract
The body member 1 and cover member 5 of a pressure cooker are adapted to be held together by means of inter engageable pairs of lugs 8,9, 10, 21 and 13, 12, 14, 24 arranged on each member. One or more selected pairs of lugs 10, 14 are constructed so that a shoulder 16 on a first lug or lugs 10 can interact with either of two linearly arranged projections 18, 19 carried by a second lug or lugs 14 . The interaction of the selected pair of lugs produces two locking positions of the body and cover. The pressure cooker preferably incorporates a further safety mechanism, such as a gasket off set device 15 which prevents pressurisation of the vessel if there is only partial overlap of the body and cover lugs.
