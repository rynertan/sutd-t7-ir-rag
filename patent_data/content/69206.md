# Single crystals of xSiC. 1 x AlN.

## Abstract
One or more single crystals 4 having a composition xSiC. 1 x AℓN where x is 0.2 to 0.5, are formed epitaxially on a substrate 5 of Al₂O₃ by heating sources of SiC 7 and AlN 8 , disposed close to the substrate, at a temperature between 1900 and 2020 C in the presence of N₂ and H₂ directed to flow over the sources of SiC and AlN towards the substrate.
