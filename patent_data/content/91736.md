# A card edge connector having biasing means.

## Abstract
The invention disclosed herein relates to a basing means 50 provided in one end of a card receiving slot 66 of a card edge connector 56 . The biasing means 50 includes a spring loaded weage 52 slidably positioned in a sloping passage 58 at one end of the slot 66 . The wedge 52 includes a vertical surface 86 which engages a side of the card 16 as the card 16 is inserted in the slot 66 . The wedge 52 moving down the sloping passage 58 increases the slot length to accommodate the card width without exerting significant longitudinal force against the end walls of the connector 56 . Further, the wedge 52 cannot be moved up the passage 58 by an uneven force being exerted on the card 16 accordingly, the card 16 can only be removed from the slot 66 in a straight line.
