# CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT FILTER AND METHOD

## Abstract
Contrast enhancement filter having first and second transparent glass substrates 16, 17 with first and second surfaces 18, 19 21, 22 with the first surface 18, 21 of each facing the medium in which the filter is disposed. A sheet like circular polarizer 12 is provided formed of stretched plastic members 13 covered by layers 14 of cellulose acetate buty rate. The circular polarizer is disposed between the first and second glass substrates 16, 17 and faces the second surfaces 19, 21 of the glass substrates. A dried plastisol primer layer 26, 27 is disposed on the surface of the layers of cellulose acetate butyrate facing the glass substrates. First and second layers 23, 24 of polyvinyl butyral adhesive secure the layers of cellulose acetate butyrate carried by the circular polarizer with the primer layers thereon to the second surfaces of the glass substrates. An anti reflection coating 31 is disposed on the first surface of the first substrate. A method for manufacturing a contrast enhancement fil ter which comprises the steps of providing a sheet like circu lar polarizer 12 formed of stretched plastic members 13 and having outer layers 14 of cellulose acetate butyrate. A thin film 26, 27 of optical clear plastisol primer is applied on the outer surfaces of the cellulose acetate butyrate layers of the circular polarizer. The primer is then dried. A transparent substrate 16 is provided with first and second surfaces 18, 19 . A layer 23 of a polyvinyl butyral adhesive 23 is then applied to the second surface 19 of the first glass substrate. The circular polarizer with its primer layer thereon is placed on the layer of polyvinyl butyral adhesive. Another layer 24 of polyvinyl butyral adhesive is then placed on the other side of the circular polarizer. A second glass substrate 17 having first and second surfaces 21, 22 with the second surface 22 with the second surface 22 facing the polyvinyl butyral adhesive is placed in the sandwich. The various parts in the sandwich are then secured into a temporary unitary assem bly. Air is evacuated from between the parts and the layers. Heat and pressure is applied to the assembly to cause the parts to be permanently bonded into a unitary assembly.
