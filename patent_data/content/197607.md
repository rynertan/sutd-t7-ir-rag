# Electric lamp.

## Abstract
The electric lamp has a current lead through 11,3,10 , of which a metal foil 3 forms a part. The metal foil 3 has side edges 8 at which the major surface 4,5 adjoin each other at an acute angle. At least one of the major surfaces 4,5 has at right angles to the side edges 8 a convex curvature 12 and along the side edges 8 a concave curvature 13 . As a result, the metal foil 3 has a small width thickness ratio w t and consequently relatively a high rigidity and great strength, a low current density and a mechanically and electrically good contact capabilities with an inner and or outer current conductor 10 and 11, respectively .
