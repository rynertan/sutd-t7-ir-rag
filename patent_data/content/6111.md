# Abrasive insert for an expandable abrading tool.

## Abstract
An abrading tool 20 is disclosed as having a tapered arbor 22 and an abrading element 24 including an expandable, axially incompressible helical element 28 . A strip 32 of abrasive material on the coils performs a machining operation upon tool rotation. Nuts 40, 44, 46 threaded on the arbor provide a means for adjustably positioning the abrading element axially along the arbor to control the diameter of each coil in order to permit initial sizing of the insert and subsequent compensation for wear of the abrasive strip.
