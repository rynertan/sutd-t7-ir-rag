# Elastomer modified unsaturated molding compositions.

## Abstract
Filled unsaturated ester bulk molding, sheet molding, premix or mat molding compositions are modified with elastomer to give finished products with both improved impact strength and improved surface characteristics. The elastomeric modifier is selected from the group consisting of chloroprene polymers and hydrocarbon polymers such as ethylene propylene di , ter , or tetrapolymers.
