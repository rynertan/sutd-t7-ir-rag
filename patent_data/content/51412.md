# Cathode material for an electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
High energy density, self healing cathode material for use in solid state or quasi solid state electrochemical cells having an active metal, e.g. lithium, anode, the cathode material containing a charge transfer complex and one or more substances that exist in the solid or liquid state at ordinary temperatures selected from the group of oxides of phosphorus and boron, halides of phosphorus and boron, chalcogenides of phosphorus and boron and oxyhalides of phosphorus and boron, wherein the cathode material has a usable degree of electronic conductivity. One example of a charge transfer complex that gives the cathode mass a usable amount of electronic conductivity is a charge transfer complex of a polymer of the type of poly 2 vinyl pyridine.
