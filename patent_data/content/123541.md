## Description
LEUKOTRIENE ANTAGONISTS The present invention is concerned with compounds having activity as leukotriene antagonists, methods for their preparation, intermediate compounds useful in their preparation and methods for using these compounds. Although the chemical identity of leukotrienes was not discovered until 1979, their history actually began in Australia in 1938 when researchers discovered slow reacting substances SRS which caused slow contractions of smooth muscle. When their chemical identity was learned,SRS was found to be a mixture of three previously unknown substances which are related chemically to the prostaglandins and thromboxanes. They were named leukotrienes because they are made by leukocytes and have three conjugated double bonds. Leukotrienes have major effects on the smaller peripheral airways of the lungs and on the larger central passages which include the trachea and the bronchi. In the presence of an allergy trigger, like pollen or dust, leukotrienes are manufactured from fatty substances trapped in the membrane of a triggered cell.A series of reactions within the cell generates a set of different leukotrienes which are transported through the cell membrane into the blood. Then they bring about a constriction of the air passages leading to breathlessness. In addition, the leukotrienes have been implicated as mediators of numerous other disease states, including inflammation, skin diseases and allergic reactions, among others. See, for example D.M. Bailey et al., Ann. Rpts.Med. Chem. 17 203 1982 . Several classes of compounds are known to be leukotriene antagonists, see e.g. United Kingdom Patent Specification No.GB A 2,058,785, which discloses phenoxyalkoxyphenyl compounds that are useful as antagonists of the slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis European Patent Application No. EP A 0 056 172, which discloses phenoxy and thiophenoxy compounds that are useful as antagonists of the slowreacting substance of anaphylaxis and European Patent Application No.EP A 0 061 800, which discloses anti SRS A bicyclic carboxylic acid derivatives. The present invention provides compounds of the formula EMI2.1 in which R1 is a radical of formula COOR3, where R3 is hydrogen or an alkyl or cycloalkyl group containing not more than six carbon atoms CH2OH CHO CH2NHSO2R4, where R4 is OH, C alkyl, C1 6 alkoxy, phenyl, phenyl substituted by C l 3 alkyl or C I 3 alkoxy, halogen, hydroxy, haloalkyl, COOH, CN, formyl, C16 acyl or C1 4 perfluoroalkyl CN orCON R5 2, where each R5, independently of the other, is H, OH or Cl q alkyl a tetrazolyl radical a monocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclic ring containing an acidic hydroxyl group or a radical of formula EMI3.1 where each s, independently of the other, is 0, 1, 2 or 3, each R10, independently of the other, is H or C14 alkyl, and R7 is A a monocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclic radical containing from 3 to 12 nuclear carbon atoms and 1 or 2 nuclear heteroatoms, one being N, and the other if any being N or S, each ring in the heterocyclic radical having 5 or 6 atoms, or B a radical X R8 where X is O, S or NH and R8 contains up to 21 carbon atoms and is 1 a hydrocarbon radical or 2 an acyl radical derived from an organic acyclic or monocyclic carboxylic acid containing not more than 1 heteroatom that is N, O or S in the ring R6 is H or C1 4 alkyl R2 is a halogen atom and R9 is a hydrogen atom or hydroxyl group and compounds that are pharmaceutically acceptable salts or acid addition salts thereof. In the foregoing definitions, halogen means F, Cl, Br or I and all radicals containing sufficient carbon atoms may be straight or branched.When R9 is OH, this invention also embodies the racemic compounds and the corresponding individual R and S isomers. Preferably R1 is COOR3 and R6 is C14 alkyl. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula II or III EMI4.1 with a compound of formula IVEMI4.2 The reaction takes place by refluxing a mixture of the compounds of formulae IV and II or Ill in an inert solvent such as, for example, methylethylketone MEK , acetone, tetrahydrofuran THF , triglyme or dichloromethane in the presence of a base. The reflux temperature is preferably in the range 40 to 130 OC. The base may be an alkali metal carbonate, for example, Li2CO3, Na2CO3, Cs2CO3 or K2CO3. An alternative procedure involves reacting a compound of formula V or VI prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV with a 1,3 dibromopane or an epihalohydrin under the same conditions as described above, with a compound of formula VII, under the same conditions as above. EMI5.1 Treatment of the compound of formula I R COOH with borane in tetrahydrofuran under known conditions 0 inert atmosphere gives the corresponding alcohol, R1 CH2OH. Alternatively, borane reduction of a compound of formula IV, V or VI under the same conditions gives the corresponding alcohol IV, V, VI, R1 CH2OH which are then converted following procedures described above to a compound of formula I R 1 CH2OH . Oxidation of the alcohol of formula I R1 CH20H by chromium trioxide in pyridine gives the corresponding aldehyde R1 CHO . Reacting a compound of formula I R1 COOH with the appropriate alkanol under acid catalysis yields the corresponding ester of formula I R3 alkyl . Reacting the ester of formula I R3 alkyl with ammonia, hydroxyl amine or alkyl or dialkylamines in a suitable solvent such as THF yields the corresponding compound of formula I R5 H, OH or alkyl . Dehydrating the amide of a compound of formula I R5 H by treatment with phosphorus pentoxide yields the corresponding nitrile of formulaI R1 CN . Reacting the foregoing nitrile with sodium azide and NHoC1 in DMF gives the compound of formula I R1 tetrazole . Treating the compound of formula I R1 CH2OH with triphenylphosphine and CBr4 in an inert solvent such as diethylether gives the corresponding compound of formula I R1 CH2Br which in turn by treatment with excess NH3 gives the compound of formula I R1 CH2WH2 . Treating the foregoing amine with a compound of R4SO2C1 in a basic solvent such as pyridine gives the compound of formula I R1 R4 SO2NHCH2 . Pro drug esters wherein R1 is a monocyclic or bicyclic heterocyclic ring containing an acidic hydroxyl group are obtained by reacting the foregoing heterocycle with a compound of formula I R1 COOH in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and hydroxybenzotriazole in an inert solvent such as DMF. Pro drug esters wherein R1 isEMI7.1 are obtained sodium salt of I R1 COONa with Brby reacting theEMI7.2 in an inert solvent such as DMF. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein are included within the scope of the present invention. Such salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases.Salts derived from inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium. calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, copper, manganous, aluminum, ferric, manganic salts and the like. Particularly preferred are the potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, tri methylamine, diethanolamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 diethylaminoethanol, tomethamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, imidazole, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methyl glucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, N ,N dibenzylethylenediamine, piperidine, N ethyl piperidine, morpholine, N ethylmorpholine, polyamine resins and the like.Biological Activity The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are therapeutically useful, since they antagonize in vitro and in vivo actions of leukotriene D4 a component of SRS . Thus these products will be useful in the treatment of pathological states in which leukotrieneD4 and related products are involved. This includes asthma and other allergic disease states, including allergic rhinitis hypersensitivity inflammation reactions in skin, e.g. psoriasis and atopic eczema, lung and gastrointestinal tract vascular and cardiovascular disorders such as angina and other disorders such as chronic bronchitis where leukotriene actions are detrimental. The antagonist activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined by measuring their ability to inhibit leukotriene D4 induced bronochoconstriction in anaesthetized guinea pigs modified KonzettRossler . When administrated directly into the duodenum oral activity they are active at 2.5 5 mg kg. Oral activity is defined as the dose producing 50 inhibition when given 10 minutes before LTD4. Percent inhibition was determined at 10 minutes and also at 30 and 50 minutes after antagonist administration. The time interval between LTD4 administration was kept constant at 20 minutes in all experiments. Table I is a comparison between three known leukotriene antagonists entries 1, 2 and 3, see G.B. 2,058,785, supra and several compounds of the present invention 4 9 . The median effective dose ED50 in mg kg required for the compounds of the present invention is either equal to or less than that of the prior art compounds. The percentage of bronchoconstriction inhibition of the compounds of the present invention, combined with the effective dose, demonstrates the superiority of the compounds of the present invention over the analogous prior art compounds.

The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of formula I will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of formula I and its route of administration. In general, the daily dose range lies within the range of from about 0.2 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, copper, manganous, aluminum, ferric, manganic salts and the like.Particularly preferred are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2 dimethylaminoethanol, 2 diethylaminoethanol, tromethamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine,N ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, ophthalmic, pulmonary, nasal, dermal, topical or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intra venous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range is from about 0.2 to about 20 mg preferably from about 1 to about 10 mg of a compound of formula I per kg of body weight per day and in the case where an oral composition is employed a suitable dosage range is, e.g. from about 1 to about 100 mg of a compound of formula I per kg of body weight per day, preferably from about 5 to about 40 mg kg. For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser. The preferred composition for inhalation is a powder which may be formulated as a cartridge from which the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of a suitable device. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration and by inhalation in the case of asthma therapy may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non aqueous liquid, an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet contains from about 25 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule contains from about 25 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient. In addition to the compounds of Formula I, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can also contain other active ingredients, such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs , peripheral analgesic agents such as zomepirac diflunisal and the like. The weight ratio of the compound of theFormula I to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the Formula I is combined with an NSAID the weight ratio of the compound of the Formula I to the NSAID will generally range from about 200 1 to about 1 200.Combinations of a compound of theFormula I and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.
