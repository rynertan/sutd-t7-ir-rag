# Improvements in and relating to electrical amplifier arrangements.

## Abstract
A pre amplifier arrangement for a magnetic replay head is shown. The amplifier arrangement is neither of the current mode type nor of the voltage mode type but is in the form of an amplifier 5 of inherent very high stability which is connected to receive the input from the head represented by the inductance L and the resistance r and with resistive feedback represented by R . The amount of feedback is insufficient to affect the overall gain of the arrangement. Therefore, the amplifier produces an integral response due to its inherent open loop characteristic and high stability of the amplifier itself. The circuit is analysed to show that it produces increased separation between the low frequency and high frequency poles.

## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATIiQG TO ELECTRICAL AMPLIFIER ARRANGEMENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to electrical amplifier circuit arrangements and more specifically to such amplifier circuit arrangements for amplifying electrical signals received from a magnetic replay head such as is used in a tape recorder. Electrical amplifier circuit arrangements used in such environments need to have a frequency response capable of compensating for the frequency response of the replay head. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided an electrical circuit arrangement, comprising an inductive input circuit, amplifier means of high stability, and means providing negative feedback for the amplifier means of insufficient magnitude to affect the overall gain whereby the output frequency characteristic of the arrangement has a relatively low value low frequency pole and a relatively high value high frequency pole. According to the invention, there is also provided an arrangement for replaying information recorded magnetically, comprising an inductive magnetic replay head and amplifier means connected to receive the signals therefrom and having high stability and with resistive negative feedback of insufficient magnitude to have significant effect on the overall gain. DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS An electrical amplifier circuit arrangement embodying the invention, and arranged to amplify the signal from a magnetic replay head will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Fig.1 is a circuit diagram of the arrangement Fig.2 is a graph showing the frequency response of the arrangement and Fig.3 is a circuit diagram of a modified form of the arrangement. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As shout, the magnetic replay head is represented by an inductance having G value L and a resistance having a value r, the impedance of the head being represented by Zi. The head feeds the inverting input of G very high stability amplifier 5 whose input is grounded. A feedback impedance having the value Zf is connected across the amplfiier, and the amplifies output is produced at an output terv.inal 6. As vill be explained in more detail below, the amplifier circuit arrangement primarily obtains its stability by means of the inherent stability of the amplifier 5 itself due to its construction preferably monolithic construction and design, and more specifically the circuit arrangement does not rely for its stability primarily on the provision of a substantial amount of feedback. The circuit arrangement will now be analysed, using the parameter values indicated in Figure 1, together with the relationship Vo A s .

Therefore, V Vo A s However, Vi Vo Zi Zf V 2 Zi Zf Zi Zf where Vi is the voltage produced by the head.

The amplifier described therefore contrasts with amplifiers of the current mode type which obtain an integral response by virtue of the inductance effect of the replay head and in which the low frequency pole tends to occur at a relatively high frequency of the order of 1KHz, for example , and also contrasts with amplifiers of the voltage mode type, which obtain an integral response owing to the use of feedback capacitance and in which the high frequency pole tends to be relatively low. The amplifier analysed above obtains its integral response by virtue of its inherent high gain and high stability and uses only a relatively small amount of feedback and, as a result, provides a low frequency pole at a lower frequency than does a pre amplifier of the current mode type and a high frequency pole at a higher frequency than does a pre amplifier of the voltage mode type. The amplifier could also be connected in the differential mode. Figure 3 shows an alternative construction in which the amplifier 5 of Fig.l is shown as an amplifier 5A with stabilising feedback 8 and fed from the head L, r through a buffer amplifier 10. A further amplifier stage 12 of unity gain is provided to ensure correct polarity and feeds the output terminal 6. Overall feedback is provided via resistor R which corresponds to the feedback provided by resistor R in Fig.l. The difference between the Fig.l and Fig.3arrangements, therefore, is that the Fig.l arrangement obtains its stability by using a low noise, high gain and low cost monolithic integrated amplifier 5, while the Fig.3 arrangement uses an amplifier 5A provided with stabilising feedback and connected in cascade with the buffer 10 and inverting stage 12. In each case, feedback through resistor R provides almost open loop overall response as shown by the mathematical analysis above which applies to Fig.3 as well as Fig.l .
