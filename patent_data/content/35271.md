## Description
ELASTOMERIC COMPOSITION FOR PROVIDING ELECTRICAL STRESS CONTROLBackground of the Invention The invention relates to high permittivity elastomeric compositions for favorably influencing electric fields associated with the splicing and termination of high voltage power cables. The composition comprises a non polar polymeric base material, a substantive amount of very fine polarizable particles capable of increasing the perinittivity of the composition and an effective amount of platelet shaped conductive particles.Typically, the composition is molded or extruded in the form of tubes for ultimate use in the splicing and terminating application, and, together with the cable insulating materials which have low permittivity, act upon electrical fields in the sense of refraction. Compositions of the general type indicated above, i.e., wherein high permittivity is sought, are known, for example, from U.S. Patent Nos. 3,258,522 and 3,287,489, along with British Patent No. 1,394,272, all of which disclose the use of carbon black in the development of high permittivity elastomeric compositions. Further, the use of ceramic or high permittivity inorganic fillers in compositions is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.3,585,274 3,673,305 3,816,639 3,823,334 3,828,115 and 4,053,702. The combination of carbon black and planarly oriented conductive platelets in highly polar organic polymer bases, in the form of thin films, has been shown to provide high permittivity with high dielectric strength, as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,349,164.Other known configurations include multi layer heat shrink products which consist of a low permittivity heat shrinkable polymeric cover which has been internally coated with an elastomeric layer which provides high permittivity principally through the incorporation of silicone carbide particles, although conducting particulate fillers may also be included see for example U.S. Patent No.3,950,604. Combinations of electrically conducting and insulating flakes are also known, as is disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 4,234,439. The usefulness of inorganic particulate materials such as barium titanate and titanium dioxide as high permittivity components for compositions having or exhibiting a refractive stress controlling action has been known for a long time, but the desirable elastomeric properties were overlooked see for example U.S. PatentNos. 3,673,305 and 3,823,334. In this connection, it has been found that when inorganic materials of very high permittivity are utilized, e.g., barium titanate having a permittivity of approximately 6,000 to 10,000, the permittivity of the elastomeric composition cannot be increased beyond approximately 20 if the composition is to retain the desirable elastomeric properties of the base material.In other words, in order to provide satisfactory permittivity, the proportion of inorganic material becomes so high as to preclude the manufacture of practical stress control elements having adequate elastomeric characteristics for providing gap free contact with electric power cables. This invention provides high permittivity stress control for high voltage power cable terminations with greatly improved impulse strength allowing the utilization of compact and more economical tubular designs. Furthermore, it provides sufficient mechanical strength and high elastic memory enabling the use of PST pre stretched tube, as hereinafter defined delivery during application. Furthermore, there are other stress controlling devices which contain materials mainly acting in a resistive manner. Such materials have the inherent disadvantage that an increase in resistivity under overload d conditions may result in excessive heating and accellerated aging of the material, which can ultimately lead to electrical breakdown. Conversely, the compositions of this invention act, together with the cable insulating materials of low permittivity, upon electrical fields in the sense of refraction. The application of tubular high permittivity stress control elements requires less knowledge and skill than the application of other stress control devices, such as the mounting of conductive stress control cones, the wrapping of stress control tapes, the molding of flowable or shapeable masses having stress controlling properties which subsequently harden at the site of installation, etc. Tubular termination designs also provide favorable economics to both the supplier and user, as less material is utilized, ultimate diameters are smaller, and creepage lengths between conductor and ground are shortened, thereby reducing space requirements at the installation site.Summary of the Invention In accordance with the invention there is provided an elastomeric composition comprising from about 2.5 to about 25 volume percent carbon black, from about 0.8 to about 7.0 volume percent of platelet shaped conductive particles, up to about 8.0 volume percent of high permittitivity inorganic fillers, up to about 12.0 volume percent of platelet shaped inorganic dielectric fillers, with the balance of the composition comprising a compounded elastomer. The composition can be conventionally molded or extruded into tubular articles which have utility in the splicing and termination of electric power cables.Detailed Description of the Invention The composition of this invention is capable of being extruded or molded into a tubular shape, and, in a preferred embodiment, can also be expanded onto a core for subsequent application. device is typically designated a PST , which stands for pre stretched tube. The core can be external, i.e on the outside of the tube, or can be inside the tube, such as is taught in U.S. patent no. 3,515,798, incorporated herein by reference. Preferabley, the core is internal and is a one piece rigid spiral core having interconnected adjacent coils in a closed helix configuration. By utilizing this PST technique, a completely insulated termination can be applied in a one step operation. The application consists essentially of a high permittivity tube covered by an arc track and weather resistant insulation which is applied to the prepared cable simultaneously with core removal. This can provide a completely insulated termination in which the electric field stresses are controlled effectively by the high permittivity tube through the refraction of electric flux lines at the interface between the cable insulation and high permittivity tube. Another characteristic of a PST which more directly pertains to the method in which it is applied, is cold shrink. This implicitly means that such devices may be applied to cables without the necessity of a heat source, as is conventionally used with heat shrink tubing. Rather, the characteristics of shrinking behaviour are a function ofsuperior elastic memory characteristics of the composition. Of course, the composition can be formulated so as to be utilized in accordance with conventional slideon techniques. The elastomeric composition should contain from about 2.5 to about 25 by volume carbon black. The carbon black may consist of essentially any commercial grade, from the large particulate size thermal types to the fine reinforcing furnade grades, including the materials termed conductive carbon black. A preferred carbon black, especially for PST applications, is a coarse furnace grade i.e. having an average particle particle diameter of from about 40 to about 1 0 nanometers , and with this material, fram about 10 to about 20 volume percent of the composition is prefereed. Carbon black is necessary to achieve an effective refraction of electric flux lines in the terminating device, and yet allow maintenance of a desired level of elasticity.Typically, the larger the particle size of the carbon black and the lower the structure thereof, the greater the volume fraction thereof is necessary. In addition to carbon black, it has been determined that from about 0.8 to about 7 percent by volume of the elastomeric canposition must be canprised of platelet shaped conductive particles, typically metallic flakes. Such flakes must be sufficiently fine to disperse readily and uniformly in the elastomeric base material and not contribute to excessive gas evolution during the vulcanization process if such is necessary , nor detract significantly from the physical properties of the resultant elastomeric tube. Aluminium platelets are most preferred, and other metallic particles, such as copper platelets can also be utilized. For a slide on application, it has been found that the concentration can be fran about 0.8 to about 7.0 percent by volume, while requirements for the PST range fran about 0.8 to about 3.0 percent by volume, with the preferred aluminum platelets, from about 1.2 to about 1.8 percent thereof by volume are preferred. It has been determined that the minimum amount of such platelets must be present in order to achieve desired impulse strength performance, which refers to the ability of the termination to withstand the potential damaging effects caused by lightning strike surges or other transient surges on the high voltage electrical line. While not absolutely essential to functionality of the invention, it has been determined that the inforporation of high permittivity in organic fillers can provide desirable results in the composition. Examples of such materials include barium titanate, titanium dioxide, strontium titanate, etc. The e use of such materials can provide superior permittivity stability over a range of electrical stresses and can assist in the generation of lower electrical loss for a given permittivity level. Up to about 8.0 percent by volume of these fillers can be included, with less than about 5.0 percent being preferred. In addition, again while not essential to functionality, the incorporation of platelet shaped inorganic fillers having dielectric characteristics can provide an improvement in the electrical strength of the invention.For example, the use of mica having particle diameters of from about 8 to about 40 micrometers and thicknesses of from about 0.5 to about 1.0 micrometers has discernably increased the dielectric strength of the elastomer composition, which in turn relates to superior AC breakdown strength of the electrical termination. This component can be present at up to about 12 volume percent, with less than about 5 volume percent being preferred. The balance of the composition comprises the compounded elastomeric component thereof. By the term compounded is meant normal conventional operations in which ingredients are added to provide the required processing behavior and physical properties of the elastomeric device. Processing could entail open mill or internal mixing, extrusion, steam autoclave or continuous vulcanization or molding techniques. In keeping with conventional preparation of such elastomeric materials, typical process aids, process oils, coupling agents, and vulcanizing agents if necessary are included in the compounded elastomeric component. Elastomers such as silicones, styrene butadiene rubber SBR , polybutadiene rubber BR , natural or synthetic polyisoprenes, EPDM and ethylene propylene copolymers EPM can be utilized. For the preparation of a PST, it has been determined that only EPDM and EPM elastomers provide the necessary physical characteristics for this utility. As aforementioned, one of the key characteristics for a termination is the impulse strength, which is tested by means of the Basic Impulse Insulation Level BIL . BIL is defined as the shock wave 1.2 x 50 microseconds and a minimum voltage level, depending on the cable rating, that the termination must endure without electrical flashover or breakdown. IRES Std. 4 1978. The desired performance level for a 20 KV termination having a 330 millimeter cutback i.e., the distance from the exposed conductor to the cable shield or ground potential is as follows Maximum Impulse Withstand Greater than 150 KV Positive and Negative 100 Percent Impulse Flashover Level Greater than 160 KV Positive and Negative Average AC Flashover Greater than 80 KV AC Breakdown Strength Greater than 100 KV The AC breakdown strength should exceed the AC flashover level by at least 20 KV for the purpose of insulation coordination of the power line and to provide a margin of safety for the terminating device. In addition to the foregoing electrical criteria for tubular stress control termination devices, if the device is in PST form, adequate physical performance criteria thereof are as follows ASTM D 412 100 Percent Modulus bess than 300 PSI 2.07 MPa ASTM D 412 Ultimate Tensile Greater than 1000 PSI Strength 6.90 MPa ASTM D 412 Ultimate Elongation Greater than 4008 ASTM D 624 Die C Tear Strength Greater than 150 PLI 26.3 kN m Permanent Set Less than 30 Permanent set is a measure of the elastic memory of a cured elastomer. In the case of a pre stretched article, excellent elastic memory will typically allow for coverage of a broad range of cable or workpiece diameters with a minimum number of sizes of pre stretched articles.For adequate sealability and optimum product versatility, the permanent set should not exceed about 30 per cent. To ascertain permanent set, a sample is subjected to a preselected strain at a specified temperature for a period of time, and released, whereupon the distance diameter, length, etc. that is unrecovered can be measured. The conditions herein involve stretching the specimen 100 percent for 22 hours at 1000C., following which the samples are allowed to equilibrate for one hour at room temperature. The samples are then released, and after a 30 minute recovery period, are measured. The following formula is then utilized to calculate permanent set Percent Permanent Set L30 Li x 100 L, Li wherein Li is the original length between benchmarks, typically one inch L5 is the stretched length between benchmarks, e.g., at 100 percent stretch, this would be two inches and L30 is the length between benchmarks after the 30 minute recovery period. The invention will now be more specifically defined by the aid of the following non limiting examples, wherein all parts are by weight unless otherwise specified.
