## Description
The present invention relates to immunosuppressants containing Spergualin compounds as an active ingredient. A number of drugs with immunosuppressive actions are already known. They include alkylating agents, antimetabolites, antibiotics, steroids, folic acid antagonists and plant alkaloids. Spergualin is a compound that was isolated by Umezawa and others from the filtrate of a culture broth of Spergualin producing microorganism of the genus Spergualin is not only effective against mouse leukemia L 1210, mouse leukemia EL 4 , Ehrlich carcinoma and sarcoma 180 bus also exhibits promising activity in controlling malignant tumors see Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application No. 48957 1982 . Umezawa et al. continued their studies on Spergualin compounds and have synthesized numerous Spergualin compounds which are more stable and have a stronger anti tumor activity see Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application Nos. 62152 1983 FR A 2514350 ,42356 1984 EP A 105193 and 76046 1984 JP 59 76046 and European Patent Application Nos. 94632 and 153720. Among these compounds are those used in the present invention. The immunosuppressive effects of steroids are considered to be accomplished principally through the anti inflammatory action and the lysis of lymphocytes. However, as is well known, steroids have diversified pharmacological effects and cause many side effects. The other immunosuppressants are classified as cytotoxic substances and their action is directed, among other things, to the pathways of nucleic acid synthesis and may often cause serious side effects on hematopoietic organs. It is therefore desired to develop immunosuppressive drugs that act selectively on lymphocytes and other cells of immunological importance while causing minimum side effects. The present invention relates to the use of Spergualin compounds of formula I shown below wherein R₁ is CH₂ ₄ , CH₂ ₆ , or R₂ is CH₂ ₂ or CH CH and R₃ is or CH₂ or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, for the preparation of medicaments having immunosuppressive activity. Preferred compounds are those wherein R₁ is CH₂ ₄ or CH₂ ₆ R₂ is CH₂ ₂ or CH CH trans and R₃ is or CH₂ or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof. Specific examples of the compounds usable as immunosuppressive agents in accordance with the present invention are listed below These compounds have the structures shown in Table 1. The compounds of formula I may form salts with acids. Salt forming acids may be inorganic or organic if they are physiologically accpetable. Preferred inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid preferred organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, glutaric acid, citric acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluensulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, propanesulfonic acid, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Among the compounds listed above, 1 to 3 are known and described in Japanese Unexamined Published Patnet Application No. 62152 1983 FR A 2514350 compounds 4 and 5 are also known and described in Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application No. 42356 1984 EP A 105193 compounds 6 to 9 are also known and described in EP A 153720 compounds 10 and 11 are also known and described in Japanese Unexamined Published Patent Application No. 76046 1984 JP 59 76046 . These known compounds may be synthesized by known methods. When the compounds are used as immunosuppressants according to the present invention, they are administered either independently or in admixture with excipients or carriers to form injections, oral formulations or suppositories. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers should be selected and their type and composition are determined by the route and method of administration. Illustrative liquid carriers include water, alcohols, as well as animal, vegetable and synthetic oils such as soybean oil, peanut oil, sesame oil and mineral oils. Exemplary solid carriers include sugars such as maltose and sucrose, amino acids, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropyl cellulose, and organic acid salts such as magnesium stearate. Carriers suitable for use in preparing injections include physiological saline, buffer solutions, solutions of sugars such as glucose, inositol, and mannitol, and glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and poly ethylene glycol . Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be freeze dried together with excipients such as sugars e.g. inositol, mannitol, glucose, mannose, maltose and sucrose and amino acids e.g. phenylalanine . Before intravenous injection, such freeze dried compounds are dissolved in suitable solvents such as sterilized water, physiological saline, glucose solution, electrolyte solution and amino acid solution. The content of the compounds of the present invention in the immunosuppressive agent varies with the specific type of formulation, and it generally ranges from 0.1 to 100 wt , preferably from 1 to 98 wt . With injections, the content of the active ingredient generally ranges from 0.1 to 30 wt , preferably from 1 to 10 wt . For oral administration, the compounds of the present invention may be mixed with any of the solid or liquid carriers listed above, and used in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, liquids or dry syrups. With capsules, tablets, granules and powders, the content of the active ingredient ranges generally from 5 to 100 wt , preferably from 25 to 98 wt . The dosage of the immunosuppressant containing the compounds of the formula I as the active ingredient according to the present invention should be properly determined depending upon the age and body weight of the patient, as well as the severity and type of the disease. The effective dose generally ranges from 1 to 100 mg kg per day for parenteral administration, and from 5 to 500 mg kg per day for oral administration. The compounds of the formula I are characterized by relatively low toxicity and small accumulation of toxicity upon continuous administration. The LD₅₀ values of compounds 1 to 11 for a single intraperitoneal administration to mice ar shown in Table 2. The compounds of the formula I exert inhibitory effects on the function of lymphocytes of immunological importance. Tests by the method of Waithe et al. Waithe et al., Handbook of Experimental Immunology, page 26.1, 1978 , revealed that the compound of the formula I appreciably inhibited the T lymphocyte blast genesis stimulated by concanavalin A Con A and the reaction of B lymphocyte blast genesis stimulated by lipopolysaccharide LPS . Therefore The above data show the ability of the compounds of the formula I to inhibit the functions of B and T lymphocytes. The inhibited B and T lymphocytes respectively mean the suppression of humoral immunity and that of cell mediated immunity. Therefore, the immunosuppressants according o the present invention containing the compounds of the formula I as the active ingredient are very effective in suppressing tissue rejection that accompanies the transplantation of an organ or skin probably because of an abnormally enhanced humoral or cellular immunity. The compounds can also be used for the treatment of diseases caused primarily by various forms of autoimmunity, as well as rheumatism and allergic diseases. The compounds of the formula I seem to have a different mechanism of action than the prior art immunosuppressants and have therefore no such serious side effects as causing disorder in hematopoietic organs as is caused by all immunosuppressants classified as cytotoxic substances, or the development of gastric ulcers and cataracts that often accompanies the administration of steroid hormones. The following test results are provided for further illustrations of the pharmacologic effects of the compounds of the formula I. CDFl mice 8 wk old, female were sensitized by intravenous injection of 1 x 10⁵ sheep red blood cells. Four days later, the sensitized mice were subcutaneously injected in one footpad with 1 x 10⁸ sheep red blood cells so as to induce delayed type hypersensitivity. The swelling of the footpad was measured at the 24th hour with a micrometer. Each of the test compounds was administered intraperitoneally in the amounts mg kg indicated in Table 3 for a period of 3 days that started on the day following the initial sensitization. The degree of footpad swelling was indicated in relative values, with the value for a control given physiological saline instead of the test compounds being taken as 100 . The results are shown in Table 3, from which one can see the great ability of the compounds of the formula I to inhibit delayed type hypersensitivity. Spleen cells from BALB C mice were distributed among wells in a microplate so that each well contained 2 x 10⁵ cells 0.2 ml. Each of the selected test compounds was added to all wells but one, the latter being used as a control. ConA 5 µg ml was added to all the wells and the so prepared cell suspensions were cultivated in a 5 CO₂ incubator for 72 hours at 37 C. Eight hours before the completion of the incubation, 1 µCi of ³H thymidine was added to each well and the uptake of the thymidine by the cultured cells was measured with a liquid scintillation counter to estimate the progress of reaction of T lymphocyte blast genesis. The percentage inhibition of the genesis by each of the test compounds was calculated by 1 Bdpm Adpm x 100 wherein Adpm indicates the uptake count for the addition of ConA alone and Bdpm, the count for the addition of both ConA and the test compound. The results are shown in Table 4. As Table 4 shows, test compound Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 11 of the above mentioned formula exhibited a strong ability to inhibit the reaction of T lymphocyte blast genesis. The uptake of ³H thymidine by B cell blasts was measured in accordance with the method used in Test Example 2, except that the inducer ConA was replaced by 100 µg ml of LPS from CDFl mice 6 10 wk old, female were immunized by intravenous injection of 1 x 10⁸ sheep red blood cells. The mice were intraperitoneally administered 12.5 mg kg per day of selected test compounds for a period of 3 days starting from the day following the intravenous injection. Four days later, spleen cells were isolated from the mice and the number of plaque forming cells was counted. The percentage inhibition of antibody production was calculated by 1 B A x 100 wherein A is the count for a control group given physiological saline and B, for the treated group. Compound Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 exhibited inhibitions of 98.5 , 95.9 , 89,4 , 89,4 and 92,9 , respectively. As is clear from the foregoing description, the compounds of the formula I have a relatively low toxicity LD₅₀ between 12.5 and 50 mg kg and exhibit good immunosuppressive actions such as the inhibition of delayed type hypersensitivity, the inhibition of the functions of T and B lymphocytes, and the inhibition of the production of antibodies against sheep red blood cells. The compounds of the formula I seem to have a different mechanism of action from the prior art immunosuppressants, and because of this fact, formula I are used for the preparation of immunosuppressing agents according to the present invention having lower side effects.
