# Process for producing a composite body for a semiconductor integrated circuit.

## Abstract
A dielectric insulator separated substrate for a semi conductor integrated circuit has a monocrystalline wafer 11 and a thick polycrystalline region formed of layers 4a 4m . Island regions 1a, 1b, 1c are formed by machin ing of the wafer 11 . To reduce curvature of the substrate in subsequent processing steps, there is formed a lamina tion of at least three thin polycrystalline leyers 4j 4m and dielectric films 6 interposed therebetween on the thick polycrystalline region. The thickness x Âµm of each of the thin layers is x y 40 wherein y is an ultimate thickness of the substrate. With the lamination, it is possible to avoid bending deformation of the substrate due to oxygen diffusion into an exposed thick polycrystalline layer during doping of an impurity into the island regions.
