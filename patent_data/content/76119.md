# Reinforced acetylene high polymers, process for preparing same and battery having same.

## Abstract
A reinforced acetylene high polymer shaped article is provided, which is comprised of an acetylene high polymer and 10 to 500 wt. parts, per 100 wt. parts of the acetylene high polymer, of a sheet form product of a fibrous material. The reinforced acetylene high polymer shaped article is prepared by polymerizing acetylene in the presence of the sheet form product coated or impregnated with a catalyst solution or by superposing the acetylene high polymer upon the sheet form product and then pressing or calendering the superposed assembly. The reinforced acetylene high polym er shaped article is useful particularly as an electrode of a battery.
