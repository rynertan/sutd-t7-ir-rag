# Bubble memory with minor major loop configurations.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble memory or the major minor loop configuration is implemented by ion implantation techni ques. The major loop ML comprises two paths 30, 31 dis posed adjacent to corresponding ends of the various minor loops 1₁, 1₂, ... , and a transfer control electrical conductor disposed at such ends. Current pulses through the conductor moves bubbles from the ends of the minor loops to one of the two paths of the major loop, and thereafter directly across the major loop to the other path.
