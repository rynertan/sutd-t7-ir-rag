# Improved blank and plunger cooling.

## Abstract
Improved blank and plunger cooling for a glass forming machine of the continuous rotary press and blow type. The machine has a plurality of different units 4 each having a plurality of mechanisms that require cooling. The arrange ment comprises a manifold 20 for each mechanism, an inlet line 16, 24 for cooling air to each manifold, a pilot operated pressure regulator 18 in each inlet line, means 26 connect ing each manifold to its associated mechanism in all forming units 4 , and means 30 associated with each regulator 18 for individually controlling the flow of pilot air to each regu lator.
