# Moving staircase.

## Abstract
A moving staircase or escalator with a number of conven tional tread boards 3 articulated together in an endless fashion and at least one pair of special tread boards 31, 32 disposed between any two conventional tread boards and articulated thereto. The tread boards 31, 32 each have substantially the same basic configuration as the conventional tread board. The rear one 32 is provided with a footboard movable up and down and normally locked to the rear one 31 of the special tread boards by a lock means 6 provided therein. When required, the movable footboard is made free to move by the release of the lock means and is supported by the front tread board 31 through forks 5 or bars 51 which are normally retracted. When the lock means is released, the movable footboard is raised and the forks or bars are simultaneously protruded to support it so that the upper surfaces of the two special treads 31, 32 are flush with each other. Stationary drives 8 effect the move ments of the movable tread, forks or bars and locking means. The thus enlarged tread surface can carry wheelchairs and other awkward loads.
