# Generation control apparatus for vehicle generators.

## Abstract
A generation control apparatus for a vehicle generator detects the output voltage of an excitation current supplying rectifier circuit 4 of the generator. When the output voltage is lower than a predetermined value, a switching element 61 is turned on and a current for operating an indicator lamp 8 is caused to flow through a resistor Re connected to the switching element 61 , thus detecting a break in the generator circuit.
