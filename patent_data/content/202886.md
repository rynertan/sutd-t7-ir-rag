# Canless method for hot working gas atomized powders.

## Abstract
A canless method for hot working a nickel base gas ato mized alloy powder. The powder is blended with nickel pow der, consolidated and sintered to a sufficient green strength. The surface of the resultant form is sealed to create an oxygen impervious layer so as to prevent oxidation therein. The sea led surface, in a sense, acts as a can. The form is then reheated and hot worked.
