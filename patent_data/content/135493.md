I. duPont deNemours and Company Suitable segmented thermoplastic copolyetherester elastomers derived from terephthalic acid, polytetramethylene ether glycol and 1,4 butanediol may be purchased from duPont under the trademark HYTRELE elastomer. Further information on HYTRELE elastomers is contained in New Commercial Polymers, 1969 1975, by Hans Georg Elias, Midland MacromolecularInstitute, Midland, Michigan 48640, translated from the German by Mary M. Exner Gordon and BreachScience Publishers New York, London and Paris at pages 85 to 89, and in Polymerization Reaction NewPolymers, Segmented Polyester Thermoplastic Elastomers by W. K.

Component B of the above formulation is preferably a styrene maleic anhydride polymer. The styrene may be replaced in whole or in part by other vinylaromatic monomers such as OC methyl styrene, chlorostyrene, bromostyrene, p methyl styrene and vinyl toluene.Similarly the maleic anhydride can be replaced in whole or in part by another unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydride such as itaconic, aconitic or citraconic anhydride.Component B optionally contains a termonomer such as C1 to C3 alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile. The preferred termonomer, where present, is methyl methacrylate. The proportions of the monomers preferably employed provide an anhydride content of from 15 to 35 by weight and a methyl methacrylate content of 5 to 15 by weight with the balance being styrene. Component C is typically an ABS or MBS type polymer that is to say a diene rubber substrate grafted with styrene and either acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate or a mixture of these monomers. However the rubber need not be the conventional polybutadiene or butadiene styrene copolymer since any rubber with a glass transition temperature below OOC. can be used. Such rubbers include other rubbers such as EPDM rubber, polypentanamer, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, polyacrylate rubbers and the like. The styrene may be replaced in whole or in part by other styrenic monomer such as described with reference to ComponentB above. The acrylonitrile may be replaced in whole or in part by methacrylonitrile. Component D is a polycarbonate resin which is suitable for injection or extrusion molding. Such polycarbonates are well known in the art and are commercially available. A variety of such polycarbonates or polycarbonate blends are disclosed in the following U.S. Patents, Nos. 3,649,712, 3,239,582, 3,742,088, 3,036,036 and 3,028,365. In addition to the above components the polyblends of the invention can advantageously contain other additives such as plasticizers, antioxidants, stabilizers, flame retardants, fibers, mineral fibers, dyes, pigments and the like. The components of the polyblend can be blended together by any convenient process. Usually however they are extrusion blended or compounded in a high intensity blender such as a Banbury Mixer. When using greater than about 30 by weight of Component B the use of extrusion blending is preferred. Components B and C can be together provided by the formulations described in U.S. Patents 4,305,869 and 4,197,376 and then blended withComponent A.

WORKING EXAMPLES AND TEST RESULTS In Controls C 1 to C 7 and Examples 1 1 to 1 8, various polyblends are prepared and tested and the results tabulated in Tables 1 to 3. ControlExamples C l to C 7 are included for comparison purposes. All Examples are prepared using 0.3 by weight Goodrite 3114 and 2.5 by weight Glycolube TS based on total weight of polymeric components A , B , C and D . The amounts of the polymeric components A , B , C and D used are parts by weight and are calculated to add up to a 100 parts by weight total. CONTROLS C l to C S Control Examples C 1 to C 5, tabulated inTable 1 show the effect of varying polycarbonate PC concentration in S MA MM ABS polyblends. The Izod impact data shows, for the 1.27 x 1.27cm. samples a maximum at 80 by weight PC See Figure 1 . The Izod impact data for the 1.27 x 0.64 cm. and the 1.27 x 0.32 cm. data show a maximum at 60 by weight PC. SeeFigures 2 and 3 . The IDI data taken at 230C. show for both IDI to maximum and IDI to fail above 20 by weight PC, rapidly increasing IDI values and the highest values at 60 by weight PC and greater. SeeFigures 4 and 5 . The same is true for IDI data taken at 200C. The Vicat softening point generally increases with PC concentration. EXAMPLES 1 1 to 1 4, C 6 AND C 7 Examples 1 1 to I 4 and Control Examples C 6 and C 7, tabulated in Table II, show the effect of PC concentration on S MA MM, ABS and TCPE polyblends.Comparing, in Figure 1, Example I 2. with 40 by weightPC and 6 by weight TCPE 2 to Control Example C 3 with 40 by weight PC and no TCPE 2, with 6 by weight TCPE present, twice the Izod impact strength at the same PC concentration is obtained. In other words, it would take nearly 30 more PC to get the same improvement that 6 by weight TCPE gives in the same polyblend. Likewise, as seen in Figure 2, comparingExample I 2 to Control Example C 3, about a 30 improvement in Izod impact using thinner samples, 1.27 X 0.64cm is obtained by adding 6 by weight TCPE. InFigure 3, comparing Example 1 1 containing 20 by weightPC and 8 by weight TCPE 2 to Control Example C 2 containing 20 by weight PC and no TCPE 2, about a 30 increase in Izod for very thin samples, i.e. 1.27 x 0.32 cm is achieved by adding 8 by weight TCPE 2. Therefore,Izod impact can be increased by adding TCPE 2, or maintained by decreasing PC and adding TCPE 2. In comparing Example I l to Control ExampleC 2 in Figure 4, it can be seen that for IDI to maximum at 230C. that 8 by weight TCPE increases IDI by a factor of 10 1000 . To achieve the same IDI value without TCPE, nearly twice as much PC would have to be used. In comparing Example I 1 to Control ExampleC 2 in Figure 5, it can be seen that for IDI to fail, 8 by weight TCPE increases IDI about 15 fold 1500 .To achieve the same IDI value without TCPE, about twice as much PC would have to be used. Likewise, comparing Example 1 2 to Control Example C 3, 6 by weight TCPE results in about a 30 increase in IDI. Comparing Example 1 1 to Control ExampleC 2 in Figures 6 and 7, a 10 to 15 fold increase in IDI at 200C., is observed with the addition of 8 by weight TCPE. Comparing I 2 to C 3, an increase of 50 to 100 in IDI is observed with the addition of 6 by weight TCPE. The results of the Izod data varies, depending on the thickness of the sample tested. For the thickest sample, 1.27 x 1.27cm, an optimum is reached at 40 by weight PC and 6 by weight TCPE 2 Example I 2 and maintained until higher than 80 by weight PC. The Example I 3 Izod data for 1.27 X 1.27cm sample appears to be an anomaly. A single optimum would be expected, as that observed for the 1.27 x 0.64cm and 1.27 x 0.32cm samples. For the 1.27 x 0.64cm Izod samples Example I 2 , an optimum is reached at 40 by weight PC and 6 by weight TCPE 2.For the thinnest samples, 1.27 x 0.32cm, a distinct optimum is reached at 60 by weight PC and 4 by weight TCPE 2 Example I 3 . The IDI to fail at 230C. increased with PC content. The IDI to maximum at 230C. reached an optimum at 80 by weight PC Example 1 4 . The h value for IDI to fail and IDI to maximum at 230C.varied and shows no clear optimum. The IDI to fail at 200C. and the IDI to maximum both increase with PC content. The Avalue for IDI to fail and IDI to maximum at 200C. shows a clear optimum at 40 by weight PC Example I 2 . The Vicat temperature decreases slightly 10C. with the addition of P.C Compare Examples 1 1 and 1 2 and then shows a marked increase with the further addition of PC. Likewise, the viscosity shows an initial decrease with the addition of PC I 1 and then shows a marked increase with the further addition of PC. The Sidewinder flow shows a decrease with the addition of PC, and Flexural Strength shows an increase with PC addition. Tensile strength and elongation to fail both increase with increasing PC concentration. The increase in viscosity and the decrease in Sidewinder flow both make injection molding more difficult. Therefore, there is an advantage in being able to achieve higher impact properties with lowerPC concentrates and therefore lower viscosity and higher Sidewinder flow.

The copolymer shows improved Izod for the thicker samples, but the terpolymer shows a slightly higher Vicat softening point.Examples I 7 and I 8 show that different copolyetherester elastomers can be used in the practice of this invention. AlthoughTCPE 2 polyblend in Example I 6 has the highest Izod, the low temperature IDI and Vicat increase with TCPE 1 and TCPE 3 in Examples I 7 and I 8 respectively.
