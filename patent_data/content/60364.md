# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING STABLE BLOCKS FROM ORGANIC MATERIAL

## Abstract
An apparatus for making stable blocks from organic material includes means for tearing the materials into fragments of a predetermined size and means for forcing the fragments through a high resistance die at high pressures and temperatures for forming the particles or fragments into a stable block without the addition of adnesives. The dies are coated with a material such as a matrix of tungsten carbide in a nickel alloy for controlling die resistance and to increase die life.
