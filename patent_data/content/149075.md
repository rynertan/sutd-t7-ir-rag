# AC transient driver for memory cells.

## Abstract
A memory circuit is provided wherein the speed of the downward transition of the memory cell is increased. A plurality of memory cells 41, 42, 44, 45, 61, 62, 64, 65 are coupled between a select line 43, 63 and a current drain line 46, 66 . A first means 49, 69 is coupled to the select line for providing current to the plurality of memory cells and is responsive to a select signal V
