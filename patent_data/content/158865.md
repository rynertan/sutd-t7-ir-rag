# Pregeneration of tetrahydroanthraquinone in a make up solution to be added to a hydrogen peroxide working solution.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process to increase the mol ratio of nuclearly hydrogenated working compound to the total working compound in a make up solution to be added to the working solution of an operating plant in producing hydrogen peroxide by the cyclic reduction, oxidation, and extraction of an alkylated anthraquinone. The process pro duces the nuclearly hydrogenated working compound in the make up solution without producing substantial quantities of undesired by products.
