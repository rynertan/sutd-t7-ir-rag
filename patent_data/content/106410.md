## Description
RepLaceable lacing means .The invention pertains to a replaceable lacing means, usable to two elements together in an easy and fast manner and especially usefull in those cases where the lacing means is expected to have a shorter life than the elements to be tied together.A typical application of the invention is the shoe industry and especially in the field of leisure wear where use is often made of hook and loop fasteners, instead of shoelaces, buckles or similar.Although known hook and loop fasteners are quite efficient, they have generally a shorter usefull life than that of the shoes themselves. As at least one part of said fastener is sewn to the shoes, this poses a problem.The object of the invention is to solve said problem by providing a hook and loop type lacing means which can easily be replaced whenever necessary.To this end, the replaceable lacing means according to the invention comprises a ribbon made of two parts fixed to one another such as by sewing, the first of said parts being one part of a hook and loop fastener and the second of said parts being the other part of said fastener, said ribbon being intended to be slid through two slots provided to this end in the element to be tied together, one end of said ribbon being provided with an abutment means, at least one dimension of which being larger than the corresponding dimension of said slots.For more clarity, one embodiment of the invention is described hereinafter by way of non limitative example, with reference to the appended drawings wherein figure 1 is a perspective view of a shoe equipped with a replaceable lacing means according to the inven tion and figure 2 shows at an enlarged scale, the part of fi gure 1 indicated by F2.The shoe 1 shown in figure 1 has an upper having two sides 2 and 3 which have to be tied or laced together. Each side is provided with a slot, 4 and 5 respectively.The lacing means according to the invention is generally indicated as 6 and has the general shape of a ribbon intended to toe slid through said slots 4 and 5. The ribbon 6 is made of two parts 8 and 9 respectively, fixed together for instance by sewing, as indicated in 7. Parts 8 and 9 correspond to the two parts of a well known hook and loop fastener. The free extremity of part 8 is provided with an abutment 10, the length of which being greater than that of the slots 4 and 5. In another embodiment, the width of abutment 10 could be greater than that of said slots.It will be seen that the lacing means according to the invention is particularily easy to use and to replace when necessary. Due to abutment 10, the sides of the shoe upper can be easily drawn together with one hand.It is clear that the use of the invention is not limited to shoes, numerous other applications being possible.
