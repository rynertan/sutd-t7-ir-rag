## Description
ZEOLITE, METHOD OF PREPARING SAME, AND CATALYTIC CONVERSION THEREWITH This invention relates to a novel highly siliceous porous crystalline zeolite related to zeolite beta, to a method for its preparation and to its use in catalytic conversion of organic compounds. Previously, zeolite beta has been prepared from mixtures containing silica and alumina and yielding a product SiO2 A1203 ratio of 5 but less than 100 as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,308,069.The materials of the present invention use Fe and or Cr and or La as substitute for added A1203 in the synthesis and can yield a product with a silica to alumina ratio greater than 100 up to infinity. In the as synthesized form, the material has a calculated composition, in terms of moles of oxides, after dehydration, per 100 moles of silica, as follows w Q2O x M2 nO y L2O3 100 SiO2 wherein Q20 is the oxide form of an organic compound containing an element of Group 5 8 , e.g., N, P, preferably N, containing at least one alkyl or aryl group having between 1 and 7 carbon atoms, preferably between 2 and 5, more preferably containing at least one ethyl group and still more preferably Q20 is a quaternary ammonium compound containing at least one ethyl group, M is an alkali metal having a valence n, e.g. Na or K, n valence of M, W 5, X 2, National Bureau of Standards Fischer Scientific Co.Table of the .Elements Y 4 and L Al, Cr, Fe, or La, or mixtures thereof. When any two of Cr, Fe, or La are not present, the other must be. The material may have Al, Fe, La and or Cr in positions of tetrahedral substitution within the silica lattice, requiring a balancing cationic valence for preservation of electrical neutrality.These cations, if present, may be replaced at least in part by other ions using conventional ion exchange techniques. Ions introduced to replace the original alkali, and or organic cations may be any that are desired so long as they can pass through the channels within the crystals. Desired replacing ions are those of hydrogen, ammonium and metals of Groups I through VIII of the Periodic Table. Among the metals, those particularly preferred are rare earth metals, manganese, zinc and those of Group VIII of the Periodic Table. The X ray diffraction pattern of materials according to the present invention has the following significant lines TABLE 1 Interplanar Relative Intensity d spacinq A 11.5 0.3 M S 7.4 t 0.2 W 6.6 0.15 W 4.15 0.10 W 3.97 , 0.1 VS 3.0 1 0.07 W 2.05 0.05 W These values were determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and an associated computer was used0 The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 theta where theta is the Bragg angle, were determined using algorithms on the computer associated with the spectrometer.From these, the relative intensities, 100 I Io, where 10 is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were determined. In Table 1, the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols VS very strong, S strong, M moderate and W weak. This X ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of zeolite beta compositions. The sodium form, as well as other cationic forms, reveals substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur, depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample, as well as its degree of thermal treatment. The new zeolite can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing an intentional source of silica, Q20, an alkali metal oxide, e.g. sodium, a chromium, iron, or lanthanum compound, water, and no added alumina, and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the following ratios REACTANTS BROAD PREFERRED SiO i2 2 to 50 4 to 15 M20 Q20 0.0 to 10 0.5 to 4 Cr203 Fe203 La2O3 Q2O 0.05 to 5 0.08 to 0.2 H2O Q2O 50 to 500 150 to 300 wherein 0 is the oxide form of an organic compound of an element of Group 5 8 of the Periodic Table e.g.N, P and can be an organic compound containing at least one ethyl group and M is alkali metal and maintaining the mixture at crystallization temperature until crystals of the highly siliceous crystal material are formed. As mentioned above, no alumina is added to the recipe. The only aluminum present occurs as an impurity in some other component of the crystallization medium. Crystallization can be carried out at either static or stirred condition in polypropylene jars at 990C 210oF or inTeflon lined stainless steel autoclaves. The total useful range or temperatures is 800C to about 1800C for about 6 hours to 150 days.Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered.The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxide. Such compositions include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, chromic potassium sulfate or ferric ammonium sulfate or lanthanum chloride, and an organic compound. The organic compounds can include any element of Group 5 8 such as nitrogen or phosphorous, preferably nitrogen. The preferred compounds are quaternary compounds generally expressed by the following formula EMI4.1 wherein J is an element of Group 5 8 of the Periodic Table, e.g. N orP, preferably N, and each R is an alkyl or aryl group having between 1 and 7 carbon atoms, and preferably at least one R group is an ethyl group. While normally each alkyl or aryl group will be the same, it is not necessary that each group have the same number of carbon atoms in the chain. The oxide of the quaternary compound is generally supplied by introducing into the reaction mixture a composition such as the hydroxide or chloride of the tetraalkyl derivative of the desired 5 8 element. In preparing an ammonium species, tetraethyl ammonium chloride or bromide or, less preferably, hydroxide is useful. In preparing the phosphonium species, tetraethyl phosphonium chloride is particularly desirable as a means of incorporating the quaternary compound into the crystal. The other elements of Group 5 8 behave similarly. The oxide can be supplied from more than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. In all cases, synthesis may be facilitated by the presence of at least 0.01 percent, preferably 0.10 percent and still more preferably at least 1.0 percent, seed crystals based on total weight of crystalline product. Catalysts comprising crystals prepared by the Instant invention can be formed in a wide variety of particle sizes.Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate having particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystal can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded. Thermal treatment of the zeolites before and after base exchange can be performed by heating one of these forms in an atmosphere such as air, nitrogen, hydrogen or steam at a temperature of at least 371oC 700 OF for at least 1 minute and generally not greater than 20 hours. While subatmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 5380C 10000F . The thermally treated product is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The zeolite can be used as a catalyst in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is desired, such component being introduced by exchange into the composition, impregnation or physical intimate mixing. Such component can be impregnated for example, in the case of platinum, by treating the zeolite with a solution containing a platinum metal containing ion. Suitable platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. It is frequently desirable to composite a zeolite with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. Such compositing practices and materials are fully described in our EP A 1695. Employing a catalytically active form of the novel crystal catalyst of this invention which may contain additional hydrogenation components, reforming stocks can be reformed employing a temperature between 3710C 7000F and 5380C 1000at . The pressure can be between 100 and 1000 psig, but is preferably between 200 and 700 psig. The liquid hourly space velocity is generally between 0.1 and 10, preferably between 0.5 and 4, and the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is generally between 1 and 20, preferably between 4 and 12. Other reactions which can be accomplished employing the zeolite of this invention in association with a metal, e.g. platinum, include hydrogenation dehydrogenation reactions and desul furization reactions, olefin polymerization oligomerization and other organic compound conversion such as the conversion of alcohols e.g. methanol to hydrocarbon. The following Examples illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing it. In them, whenever adsorption data are set forth for comparison of sorptive capacities for water, cyciohexane and n hexane, they were determined as follows A weighed sample of the calcined adsorbant was contacted with the desired pure adsorbate vapor in an adsorption chamber, evacuated to 1 mm and contacted with 12 mm Hg of water vapor or 20 mm Hg of cycolhexane or n hexane vapor, pressures less than the vapor liquid equilibrium pressure of the respective adsorbate at room temperature.The pressure was kept constant within about 0.5 mm by addition of adsorbate vapor controlled by a manostat during the adsorption period, which did not exceed about 8 hours. As adsorbate was adsorbed by the crystal, the decrease in pressure caused the manostat to open a valve which admitted more adsorbate vapor to ble chamber to restore the above control pressures. Sorption was complete when the pressure change was not sufficient to activate the manostat. The increase in weight was calculated as the adsorption capacity of the sample in g l00 g of calcined adsorbant. EXAMPLES 1 11 In these examples, the starting gel reaction mixture was prepared from sources of silica such as Q Brand sodium silicate 28.8 SiO2, 8.9 Na20 and S 35 sodium silicate 25.3S SiO2, 6.8 Na20 . Fume silica HiSil 91.3 SiO2 may also be used. The source of tetraethylammonium organic cation was supplied by either the hydroxide 40S solution or by salts such as halide. The metal salts used were chromic potassium sulfate, ferric ammonium sulfate and lanthanum chloride. Other salts such as chlorides and nitrates can be used. Moles of h0 were excess Na20 after neutralization of moles of mineral acid added to the mixture.Crystallization was carried out at static conditions in stainless steel autoclaves. After crystals formed, the product was filtered, water washed and dried at 110 C 2300F .
