## Description
This invention relates to a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus for measuring the concentration distribution of a specific atomic nucleus in a body to be examined and or the relaxation time of the same from the outside of the body by making use of nuclear magnetic resonance NMR phenomena. The construction adjacent the magnetic field generating part of a recently developed examining NMR apparatus is shown in Figure 1 see application No. 81302590.5 dated 10th June 1981 and published as EP A 0042256 . As shown, a homogeneous static magnetic field is designated by the arrow Z. Also, a gradient magnetic field is superimposed in the direction Z by a pair of electromagnets 3. The resulting magnetic fields are shown in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the abscissa designates the position of the magnetic field in the direction Z and the ordinate designates the intensity of the magnetic field at each position. Although the intensity of the magnetic field is constant regardless of its position in the direction Z if there is only the homogeneous magnetic field, as shown by a broken line H For example, when measurements are performed by using a phantom or a model of a body to be examined 4, a part 4a of which has a preassigned low concentration of hydrogen nuclei, for example, the intensity of a nuclear magnetic resonance signal is obtained with the result shown in Figure 3a, having a deflection 4a, in the intensity of the NMR signal. Since the intensity of the magnetic field, as shown by the resonance signals and the position of the field in the direction Z are in a corresponding relation, as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, the intensity of the NMR signal obtained represents the projection datum in the direction perpendicular to the direction Z in the particular section of the phantom. Therefore, if projection data in each direction are obtained, the concentration distribution image of a specific atomic nucleus for example, hydrogen nucleus in the section can be reconstructed in the same manner as in the case of computed tomography CT . To achieve this result, the apparatus of Figure 1 has been able to obtain such data only while rotating the body, such as the phantom 4, within the magnetic frame, as shown for example in the apparatus of DE A 2946847. For example, the signal shown in Figure 3b is obtained when the phantom 4 has been rotated 90 . In Figure 1, a coil 5 wound around the phantom 4 is used to detect the nuclear magnetic resonance signal after adding a high frequency electromagnetic pulse train to the body. As described above, since the examining NMR apparatus in Figure 1 applies a gradient magnetic field in only one direction, the following means have been needed for obtaining projection data as to a section of the body A rotating scan apparatus is obviously needed for obtaining the result by either means. In either case, the scan is time consuming. Additionally, it is feared that the rotation of the body may involve movement of portions of the body, or interaction of parts of the body, which may be damaging to an already unhealthy body. The magnet frame involves considerable weight, and the rotation of the frame is burdensome and difficult. Accordingly, this invention seeks to provide an NMR apparatus which can measure either the concentration distribution of specific atomic nuclei in a section of a body or the difference in their relaxation times without mechanical rotation of the body or the magnetic field generating apparatus. DE 29 46 820 discloses an arrangement in which a magnetic field Gr is produced which is in the z direction but has a gradient in a perpendicular direction, and in the vector sum of two gradient fields Gx and Gy. These are stated to be variable to change the direction of r. However the arrangement disclosed in this document requires a large number of different field coils and complex associated driving circuits because it requires a static field Hzo, and a basic gradient field Gz as well as the gradient fields Gx and Gy. The present invention seeks to provide an NMR scanning system in which a resultant gradient field can be rotated, thus rotating the equivalent magnetic field lines in the specified plane to be examined, with a simplified control system and a reduced number of field coils. According to the invention there is provided nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus, for measuring the NMR concentration distribution of a specified atomic nucleus in multiple directions in a specific plane of a body to be examined, including magnet means for generating a homogeneous static magnetic field, whose magnetic lines of force are parallel to said specified plane, around the body, an oscillator for generating an oscillating output having a frequency corresponding to the nuclear magnetic resonance condition of the atomic nucleus to be measured One embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In Figure 4 an oscillator 6 generates high frequency waves with selectably variable intensity or amplitude and a bridge type receiver 7 is used to detect an NMR signal from a body P to be examined, using the output of the oscillator 6. A coil 8 wound around the body P applies the high frequency waves or electromagnetic waves from the oscillator 6 to the body P through the receiver 7 and extracts the NMR signal from the body P to apply it to the receiver 7. An amplifier 9 amplifies the NMR signal generated from the receiver 7 and a recorder 10 records the NMR signal amplified by the amplifier 9. A reconstructor 11 reconstructs the concentration distribution image of the specific atomic nuclei on the basis of the NMR signal recorded in the recorder 10 and a display unit 12 depicts the image reconstructed by the reconstructor 11. Magnetic apparatus, such as a pair of electromagnets 13, generates a homogeneous static magnetic field between the magnetic pole plates 15 of the electromagnets and a D.C. stabilised power supply 14 energises the electromagnets. Wedge shaped shims 16 of a magnetic substance are disposed to protrude from the facing magnetic pole plates 15 for generating a first gradient magnetic field. A.C. electromagnetic apparatus such as electromagnetic coils 17 make an A.C. magnetic field generated in superimposition with the static magnetic field of an A.C. power supply 18 energises the electromagnetic coils 17. Electromagnetic apparatus, such as a pair of coils 19, generate a second gradient magnetic field in superimposition with the static magnetic field. A gradient magnetic field controller, such as control power supply 20, actuates the coils 19 to control the rotation of the total gradient magnetic field. In operation, homogeneous static magnetic field Ho Figure 5 in the direction Z is generated by flowing D.C. current from the stabilised power supply 14 to the electromagnets 13. Since the wedge shaped shims 16 are mounted on the magnetic pole members 15, the homogeneous static magnetic field Ho is varied to make a first gradient magnetic field in the direction Y in Figure 4. Thus, the gradient magnetic field Gy y is generated, as shown in Figures 5a, and 5b. A gradient is, thus, added to the static magnetic field Ho by the first gradient magnetic field Gy y due to the shims 16 to produce a magnetic field having a line of magnetic force in the direction Z and a gradient intensity distribution of the magnetic field in the direction Y. In addition, as shown in Figure 6a, the second gradient magnetic field Gz z having a gradient intensity distribution of magnetic field in the direction Z, is generated by passing A.C. current to the pair of coils 19 for the control power supply 20, the current flow in the pair of coils being in opposite directions. The intensity distribution of the magnetic field in the case of superimposing the second gradient magnetic field Gz z on the static magnetic field Ho is shown in Figure 6b. The gradient magnetic field Gz z has the feature that the line of magnetic force is in the direction Z, the intensity of the magnetic field is zero at the centre and the direction of the lines of magnetic force are reversed at the sides of the centre. When the reversed gradient magnetic fields are used together, the magnetic field superimposed on the static magnetic field results in a composite gradient magnetic field having a line of magnetic force M oriented in the direction Z and a gradient intensity of magnetic field oriented in a specific direction of the y z face, as shown in Figure 7. Namely, the intensity of magnetic field H y, z at a point y, z in the y z coordinates is given for the static magnetic field Ho and the gradient magnetic fields Gy and Gz by the following equation Assuming that the centre point in the Z axis Figure 6b is at the centre between the magnetic pole plates and the fields on the sides of the centre are equal, the intensity of magnetic field H y, z is given by the following equation The following equation is derived from the equation 4 Since the value of Gzo can be changed by controlling the output current from the control power supply 20 for the gradient magnetic field generating coils 19, the gradient of the equivalent magnetic field line or face F A high frequency A.C. signal of constant frequency is generated by the oscillator 6 for application to the body P through the bridge type receiver 7 and coil 8. A variable condenser C in the receiver 7 has been previously adjusted so that the output signal from the receiver 7 may be zero when there is no NMR signal. Thus, when an A.C. magnetic field is applied by the electromagnetic coils 17 while the aforementioned gradient magnetic fields are maintained, the integral values of the specific atomic nuclei in each equivalent magnetic field line in a section determined by the coil 8 are sequentially obtained in accordance with the frequency of the A.C. magnetic field. That is, projection data of the specific atomic nuclei distribution in a direction along equivalent magnetic field lines as to the section under examination are obtained. After amplifying the projection data with the amplifier 9, they are recorded with the recorder 10. In recording the projection data, synchronising signals are obtained from the A.C. power supply 18 for the electromagnetic coils 17 so that the record of the projection data may be correlated with the projection position. When the signal noise ratio S N of the signals obtained is not sufficient, the signals for several periods of the A.C. magnetic field may be integrated. After obtaining the projection data as to one direction, as described before, the projection data are sent to the reconstructur 11 from the recorder 10, together with the signals correlating the gradient of the equivalent magnetic field lines, which are applied from the control power supply 20 for the gradient magnetic field generating coil 19. Next, the equivalent magnetic field lines are rotated a certain angle by the control power supply 20 to again collect the projection data in the same process as previously described. Thus, an image reconstruction is performed by the reconstructor 11 on the basis of the projection data obtained from a plurality of directions. This reconstruction can be performed with an algorithm similar to that used in the reconstruction in an x ray computed tomography. The result is depicted on the display unit 12. Consequentially, the concentration distribution image of the specific atomic nuclei can be determined in the section of the body P under examination. It is known that the differences in the relaxation time T₁ of the above mentioned specific atomic nucleus carries information as to the biochemical situation of human tissue, for example, the difference between normal tissue and malignant tissue. Accordingly, in the above mentioned construction, the differences in relaxation time can be identified by changing the output signal of the oscillator 6. The absorbing term v out of the regular solution of Bloch s equation is given by the following equation wherein When the output intensity of the oscillator 6 is small, the Lorentian absorption line having the half value width of 1 T₂ is obtained as the projection signal as to a point image as shown in Figure 8a. On the other hand, the third term 2H Moreover, a pair of permanent magnets may be utilised as a substitute for the pair of electromagnets in the magnetic apparatus generating the homogeneous static magnetic field. Also, the members generating the gradient magnetic field may be defined in shapes other than a wedge. Thus, the concentration distribution image of a specific atomic nucleus in the section of the body can be obtained by a combination of the gradient magnetic field due to the shims and the gradient magnetic field due to the electromagnets without rotating the body or the magnet system. The information as to the differences of the relaxation times of the atomic nuclei can be also obtained easily. This invention is not limited only to the embodiment thus far described with reference to the accompanying drawings but various modifications are also possible. For example, although the above mentioned embodiment is constructed to perform the measurement of NMR by utilising the so called continuous wave method, the so called pulse method may be utilised as follows Pulsating high frequency waves are generated in place of the steady or continuous high frequency waves from the oscillator 6 so that pulsating electromagnetic waves are applied to the body P through the coil 8. If, at this time, the width t
