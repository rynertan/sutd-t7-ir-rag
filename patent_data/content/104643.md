# 5 MEMBERED CYCLIC PHOSPHONATES AND COMPOSITIONS THEREOF

## Abstract
2 Alkyl substituted phenoxy 2,3 dihydro 1,2 benz oxaphosphole 2 oxide, cyclic phosponates prepared, for example from hindered phenols and ortho methylolphenols, are effective heat stabilizers and antioxidants for organic materials subject to degradation by heat, oxygen and the like, and result in effective stabilizer systems when combined with hydroxyphenylalkylenyl isocyanurates.
