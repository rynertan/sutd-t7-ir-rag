# Delivery system for glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
A delivery system for use with glassware forming machines of the rotating table type having a plurality of continuously rotating spaced forming units spaced about the periphery thereof. The delivery system includes a plurality of gob guiding units 11 each having a scoop 10 , trough 12 and deflector 14 secured to a corresponding oscillating frame 15 . A vertical pivot shaft 42 supports each scoop 10 and is operatively connected with an actuating means 70 to move the corresponding scoop 12 laterally between a delivery position and a reject position. The actuating means 70 is responsive to a plurality of gob reject actuators 502, 504 in order to enable selective delivery or rejection of individual gobs of selected forming units.
