# Process for operating and controlling compound needles, and stitch forming cams suitable for carrying out this process.

## Abstract
This invention is obtained with a procedure to operate and control compound needles 10 of a type having a recip rocal travel of needle and slider restricted by appropriate abutment surfaces 35 36 37 on a needle 11 and slider 12 , which procedure comprises the lifting of the needle 11 by an amount enough to engage the yarn but less than the recip rocal needle slider travel, and also the descent of the needle 11 , and also comprises. before such descent of the needle 11 , the selective lifting of the needle 11 by an amount such as to bring, through the action of abutment between the nee dle and slider 36 37 , the upper end of the slider 12 above the plane of knock over of the sinkers 38 , the descent of the needle 11 taking place along at least two successive slopes 120 220 in a track 20 with different descent inclinations of which the second slope 220 is steeper, the recall of the slider 12 by the needle 11 beginning before the needle 11 itself is brought down again by the second slope 220 the inven tion is also obtained with improvements to stitch forming cams in circular knitting machines, such improvements being suitable for enabling compound needles 10 to be operated and controlled according to the above procedure.
