## Description
Novel substituted nitrodiphenyl ethers, herbi cidal compositions containing them, processes for the preparation thereof ahd the flse thereof for combatingWeeds. This invention concerns the provision of new nitrodiphenyl ethers, the preparation thereof, herbicidal compositions containing them and methods of combating weeds. Diphenyl ethers are known to be effective weed control agents. See for example U.S. Patent Nos.3,928,416 3,454,392 3,798,276 3,873,303 4,001,005 and 4,029,493 among the many patents issued. However, herbicidal effectiveness of a diphenyl ether cannot be predicted from its structure only and often quite closely related compounds will have quite different weed control abilities. See, Advances in Agronomy, Vol. 24, pages 331, 332, 355, 356, 357 and 358, Herbicides, ChemicalDegradation and Mode of Action, Kearney and Kaufman,Vol. 2, Dekker, Inc. pages 552 563 and 728 737 and Mode of Action of Herbicides, Ashton and Crafts and also U.S.Patent Nos. 3,454,392 and 3,776,961. An ideal herbicide should give selective weed control, over the full growing season, with a single administration at low rates of application. It should be able to control all common weeds by killing them as the seed, the germinating seed, the seedling, and the growing plant. At the same time, the herbicide shpuld be substantially non phytotoxic to the crops to which it is applied and should decompose or otherwise be dissipated so as not poison the soil permanently. The known diphenyl ether herbicides fall short of these ideals and thus the search has continued to discover new herbicides which are more selective or which complement the activities of known diphenyl ethers. The new nitrodiphenyl ethers concerned in the invention are, in comparison with known herbicides, of utility in one or more of the following respects, viz.acceptable lack of phytotoxicity towards plants yielding an agronomic crop, broad spectrum weed control and acceptable toxicological properties. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a new class of diphenyl ether herbicides having the following structural formula EMI2.1 wherein X is hydrogen, halo, trihalomethyl preferably trifluoromethyl , alkyl e.g. C1 C10 , C1 C6 and, preferably, C1 C4 alkyl , cyano or nitro xl is hydrogen, halo or trihalomethyl preferably trifluoromethyl X2 is trihalomethyl preferably trifluoromethyl or halo Y is O, NH, NR1 or S R1 and R2 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl and phenyl C1 C4 alkyl preferably benzyl or phenetyl n is an integer of from 1 to 5 the groups CR1R2 being the same or different when n l and Z is carboxy, amino, mono or di alkylamino preferably mono or di C1 C4 alkylamino and the agronomically acceptable salts, esters and amides of compounds wherein Z is carboxy.

It will be evident that compounds of Formula I may be used in the preparation of other compounds of Formula I.For example, it will be seen from some of the foregoing examples that there may be used for this purpose compounds of Formula I wherein Y is oxygen and Z is carboxy, a carboxy ester, a carboxy salt or a carboxy amide hereinafter for brevity referred to as precursor compounds .An example vide Example 16 of the use of such a precursor compound is the conversion of a free carboxylic acid i.e.Z COOH to an acid chloride, fluoride or bromide, eg by reaction with a halogenating agent such as thionyl halide N in a suitable liquid medium. The acid halide can then be reacted with ammonia or an amine eg mono or di C1 C4 alkyl amines to give an amide. Alternatively vide Examples 16 and 17 , the acid halides may be reacted with an appropriate hydroxy compound, if necessary in the presence of a hydrogen halide acceptor, to give an ester. Examples of hydroxy compounds are alkanols optionally substituted with halo, alkoxy and or haloalkoxy.The precursor compounds of Formula I wherein Z is carboxy may be converted to salts, eg by reaction in solution or suspension with a strong base such as an alkali metal hydroxide cf. Examples 22 and 23 or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide. The salts can then be reacted with an appropriate chloro, bromo or fluoro compound to give an ester, an example of this reaction being given in Example 19.When the precursor compounds are esters of compounds of Formula I wherein Z is COOH, the esters may be converted by hydrolysis to the free acids as in Example 32. In some cases the esters may converted to the free acids simply by thermal decomposition as in Examples 2 and 4 where the tbutyl esters are thermally decomposed by the loss of isobutylene.

Preemergence herbicides are ordinarily used to treat the soil by application either before seeding, during seeding, or after seeding with the crop and before the crop emerges.Postemergence herbicides are those which are applied after the crop plants have emerged and during their growth period. The compounds ofFormula I are especially active as postemergence herbicides.Thus the invention provides a method of combating weeds, usually in an agronomic crop area, which comprises applying to the growing weeds, eg weed seedlings, or to the surface of a growth medium prior to emergence of the weeds, one or more of the diphenyl ethers in an amount sufficient to combat the growth of the weeds.Among the crops on which the diphenyl ethers of the invention can be advantageously employed are, cotton, soybeans, peanuts, beans, peas, carrots, maize, wheat and other cereal crops.The diphenyl ethers of Formula I are useful for controlling weeds in rice crops. When used in transplanted rice crops, the ethers can be applied either preemergence or postemergence to the weeds that is, they can be applied to the transplanted rice plants and their growth medium either before the weed plants have emerged or while they are in their early stages of growth. The ethers can be applied to the growth medium either before or after the rice has been transplanted to that medium.The diphenyl ethers of Formula I can be applied in any amount which will give the required control of weeds. A standard rate of application of the herbicides of the invention is in the range from about 0.022 to about 13.5 kg ha 0.02 to 12 lb A . A preferred range is from about 0.1 to about 2.24 kg ha 0.1 to 2 lb A .Under some conditions, the diphenyl ethers may be advantageously incorporated into the soil or other growth medium prior to planting a crop. This incorporation can be by any convenient means, including simple mixing with the soil, applying the diphenyl ether to the surface of the soil and then discing or dragging into the soil to the desired depth or by employing a liquid carrier.In their application as herbicides one or more of the compounds of Formula I will usually be used in conjunction with an agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent and optionally a surfactant so as to provide a herbicidal composition which, in general, will contain from 0.1 to 99.9 more usually 1 to 99 and even more usually 5 to 95 by weight of active herbicidal component comprising or consisting of one or more of the diphenyl ethers ofFormula I.These herbicidal compositions may be in the form of ready for use dusts, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, granules or pellets alternatively they may be in the form of concentrated solutions, wettable powders, water dispersible granules, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable liquid suspensions, flowable emulsion concen N trates, pastes or dust concentrates each for dilution with, as the case may be, additional liquid usually water or finely divided solids to give diluted solutions, suspensions, emulsions, or dusts which are then directly usable as herbicidal compositions.By the term agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent as used above is meant a substance which can be utilized to dissolve, disperse, diffuse or otherwise dilute the active ingredient without impairing the effectiveness of the active ingredient and which does no permanent damage to such loci as soil, equipment and agronomic crops.It is usually desirable, particularly in post emergence applications, to include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, and the like, in accordance with agricultural practices.Examples of adjuvants which are commonly used in the art can be found in the John W. McCutcheon, Inc. publication Detergents and Emulsifiers 1969 Annual .Examples of solvents which are useful in the practice of this invention include alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, dimethyl formamide, dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like. Mixtures of these solvents can also be used.Typical solutions contain about 2 to about 98 by weight of active ingredient and more usually about 25 to about 75 by weight.For the preparation of emulsifiable concentrates, the diphenyl ether can be dissolved in organic solvents, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, methylated naphthalene, corn oil, pine oil, o dichlorobenzene, isophorone, cyclohexanone, or methyl oleate, or in mixtures of these solvents, together with an emulsifying agent which permits dispersion in water. Suitable emulsifiers include, ethylene oxide derivatives of alkylphenols or long chain alcohols, mercaptans, carboxylic acids, and reactive amines and partially esterified polyhydric alcohols.Solvent soluble sulfates or sulfonates, such as the alkaline earth salts or amine salts of alkylbenzene sulfonates and the fatty alcohol sodium sulfates, having surface active properties can be used as emulsifiers either alone or in conjunction with an ethylene oxide reaction product. Flowable emulsion concentrates are formulated similarly to the emulsifiable concentrates and include, in addition to the above components, water and a stabilizing agent such as a watersoluble cellulose derivative or a water soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid. Emulsifiable concentrates typically contain about 10 to 60 by weight of active ingredient and flowable emulsion concentrates can contain up to 75 by weight of active ingredient. Wettable powders suitable for spraying, can be prepared by admixing the compound with a finely divided solid, such as clays, inorganic silicates and carbonates, and silicas and then incorporating wetting agents, sticking agents, and or dispersing agents. The concentration of active ingredients in such formulations is typically in the range of from about 20 to about 98 by weight, and, preferably, from about 408 to about 75 by weight. A dispersing agent can constitute about 0.5 to about 3 by weight of the composition, and a wetting agent can constitute from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of the composition.Dusts can be prepared by mixing the diphenyl ethers with finely divided inert solids which may be organic or inorganic in nature. Materials useful for this purpose include, for example, botanical flours, silicas, silicates, carbonates and clays. One convenient method of preparing a dust is to dilute a wettable powder with a finely divided carrier. Dust concentrates containing from about 20 to about 80 by weight of the active ingredient are commonly made and are subsequently diluted to about 1 to about 10 by weight use concentration.Granular formulations can be prepared by impregnating a solid, such as granular fuller s earth, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, seed hulls, including bran or other grain hulls, or similar material. A solution Of one or more of the diphenyl ethers in a volatile organic solvent can be sprayed or mixed with the granular solid and the solvent then removed by evaporation. The granular material can have any suitable size, with a preferably size range of from 16 to 60 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Series and typically contain from about 2 to about 15 by weight of active ingredient.The diphenyl ethers of Formula I can also be mixed with fertilizers or fertilizing materials before their application. In one type of solid fertilizing composition in which the diphenyl ethers can be used, particles of a fertilizer or fertilizing ingredients, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, or ammonium phosphate, can be coated with one or more of the ethers. The solid diphenyl ethers and solid fertilizing material can also be admixed in mixing or blending equipment, or they can be incorporated with fertilizers in granular formulations.Any relative proportion of diphenyl ether and fertilizer can be used which is suitable for the crops and weeds to be treated. The diphenyl ether will commonly be present in an amount from about 5 to about 25 by weight of the fertilizing composition. These compositions provide fertilizing materials which promote the rapid growth of desired plants, and at the same time control the growth of undesired plants.The diphenyl ethers can be applied as herbicidal sprays by methods commonly employed, such as conventional highgallonage hydraulic sprays, low gallonage sprays, airblast spray, aerial sprays and dusts. For low volume applications a solution of the compound is usually used. The dilution and rate of application will usually depend upon such factors as the type of equipment employed, the method of application, the area to be treated and the type and stage of development of the weeds..For some applications, it may be desirable to add one or more other herbicides along with diphenyl ethers of the invention.
