# Method of production of cladding tube for nuclear fuel element.

## Abstract
In a method of production of a cladding tube for a nuclear fuel element, an outer hollow billet 1 of a zirconium alloy and an inner hollow billet 2 of zirconium are joined by expansion of the inner billet 2 . To improve the bonding of the inner and outer billets and provide better thickness control, a resilient member 4 is inserted in the inner hollow billet 2 and a pressure oriented axially of the two hollow billets is applied to the resilient member to pressure bond the outer wall surface of the inner billet 2 to the inner wall surface of the outer billet 1 , and the interfaces of the opposite ends of the two billets are then joined and sealed. The integral hollow billet so formed is subjected to hot extrusion, cold working and heat treatment to produce a composite tube of reduced diameter and reduced thickness, and the inner and outer wall surfaces of the composite tube are polished.
