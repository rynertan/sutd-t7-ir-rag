## Description
The present invention relates to an expander device, ror arranging new tread rings on the carcass or won tires, in the retreading process there or. As it is knots the tires having a worn tread but a not worn carcass may advantageonsly be retreaded, in particular it they are or large size, by applying on the perimetrical portion whereer a new premolded tread ring. he mentioned retreading operation, which is preceded by substantially knows operations, intended tor suitably preparing the carcass surface to make it ready tor coupling with the new tread ring,involves,as it will be well knows to those skilled in the art,a preliminary spreading, in the radial direction, or the tread ring itself. To that end, expander devices are presently used which are provided with a plurality of horizontal ly extending rods arranged according to even spacings along a circumpherential line and effective to perpendicularly slide along the corresponding rays of said circumpherential lime. Usually the above mentioned simultaneous sliding of the rods, in order to move apart from one another and approach one another said rods is achieves by means of an articulated parallelogram system which latter are generally operated by means of doubly acting hydraulic cylinders. That construction,however,is a rather intricate one since it requires that the length and pivot points of the several parallelogram forming arms be precisely designed. Adore specifically, the provision or a plurality of rods,obliquely located with respect to the pusher arms, requires moreover the use of large cross section rods, thereby there is obtained a mechanical assembly of rather high size and weight. Those constructional requirements, jointly to the frictions and reaction forces developed at the red pivot points involve the use of high powers in order to obtain the requires extension movement of said rods. Accordingly, the task or the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks, by providing guch an expander device fer arranging naa tread rings on worn tire carcasses which is devoid or any articulated portions susceptible to wear at the pivot or articulation points Within the above task, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide such an expander device, for arranging new tread rings on worn tire carcasses, which is completely devoid of any portions subjected to bending and or shear stresses. Another object of tne present invention is to provide such an expander device for arranging new tread rings on worn tire carcasses which, for a proper operation khereot,requires a substantially reduced operating power. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such an expander device for arranging new tread rings on worn tire carcasses which comprises a reduced number of component parts, cooperating with one another, thereby providing a greatly efficient assembly for the user. According to one aspect of the present invention the above task and obJects, 8 well as yet other objects, which will become ore apparent herein after, are achieved by an expander device for arranging new tread rings on worn tire carcasses, characterized in that it comprises a base, bearing a horizontally extending shaft, effective to rate about the axis thereof and at the end thereof there is keyed a bevel gear wheel meshing with a plurality of bevel sprockets, said bevel sprockets being arranged along a circumpherential path and being provided with perpendicularly intersecting axes with respect to said bevel gear wheel axis, said bevel sprockets being each mounted at one end of a round cross section bar the other end whereof is provided with a threaded portion engaging with a nut screw, as formea in a block supporting cantilever wise a rod member,means being further provided for firmly coupling said rods to one another and to the supporting member of said horizontally extending shaft. Further characteristics and advantages of the expander device according to the present invention will become more apparent thereinafter from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof, being illustrated,by way of an indicative example, in the figures of the accompanying drawings,idere Pig.l is a partially sectioned side view of the expander device according to the present invention and Fig.2 is a front view of that same expander device. With reference to the number references of the figures of the accompanying drawigs, the expander device according to the present invention comprises a base 1 bearing, at the top whereof and through a supporting member 2,a horizontally extending small shaft 3. At the two ends of said shaft there are keyed,respectively,a first gear wheel 4 and a second bevel gear wheel 5, which have suitably different diameters. The mentioned first gear wheel 4 is rotated through a chain 6 or other suitable driving means, by the sprocket 7 ihich is mouated on the shaft of an electric motor 8,mounted on a horizontal plate 9 rigid with said base 1. To the supporting frame there is affixed, coaxiolly to said horizontally extending shaft 3, cylindrical box like structure 10, in the side wall thereof there are formed hole pairs 11 and 12 which are arranged along perpendicularly lines to the bottom of said structure and evenly spaced from one another. The inner holes 11 of said hole pair, which are closer to said supporting frame 2, are effective to affix a respective end of corresponding cylindrical small bars or columns 13, whereas the outer holes 12 are effective to support round cross section bars having a portion whereof extending in parallel and adjoining relationship with respect to said cylindrical columns and provided with a thread, and a smooth portion 15 bearing, at the end thereof, a small bevel gear wheel 16, engaging with the bevel gear wheel 5. The mentioned cylindrical columns 13 and threaded portions 14 of said cylindrical bars engage,respectively by a prismatic and helicoidal fitting, with a small block 17. The latter cantilever wise supports a parallelepipedal body 18,perpendicularly extending with respect to said small block and provided with a plurality of parallely extending counter bores 19. Within a said counterbore there is inserted a rod 20, of suitable length, which is locked in said counterbore by means of a transversal pin 21. It ahould be noted that the use of either counterbores will depend on the diameter or the tread ring to be fitted on the tire. More specifically, said rod may comprise a plurality Or projecting rollers, or it may be designed in other suitable ways to facilitate the disengaging thereof from the lower surface of the new tread ring, as the latter has been glued, at least partially, on the tire carcass. Advantageouslythe base 1 is slidingly mounted on a carriage 22 provide,in addition to the conventional wheels 23, with floor bearing members, consisting of threaded bars 24 helically coupled to said carriage and effective to be operated by means of a handwheel. More specifically, said base rests,throgh suitable slides 25, on rectilinear sliding guides 26, and it is driven through a helicoidal screw 27 nut screw 28 oupling. Said nut screw 28 is rotatively coupled to the two transversal walls of the carriage 22 frame and supports, at one end thereof,a gear wheel 2,hich is rotkted,through a driving member 30,by means of 4 sprocket keyed on the shaft of an electric motor indicated at 31. For retreading, after having mounted the tread ring on the rod 20,the electric motordis operated in such a way as to obtain the desired expansion of said tread ring. Then, by operating the electric motor 31, the expander device is caused to be displaced along the carriage 22, in such a way as to locate the tread ring about the tire carcass and, by operating again the motor bathe tread ring is rotated is the opposite direction and released on the tire. Successively, by rotating in the opposite direction said screw Z ,the rods 20 are disengaged from the tread ring. From the above description and the figures of the accompanying drawings will be self evident the great functionality and use facility characteriz ing the expander device for arranging new tread rings on worn tire carcasses according to the present invention. Obviously the subject expander device has been thereinabove disclosed and illustrated only by way of am indicative but not limitative example and only in order to demonstrate the main characteristics of the present invention. Thus it will be clear that the invention is susceptible to all of modifications and variations falling within the spirit and scope thereof, as defined in the accompanying claims.
