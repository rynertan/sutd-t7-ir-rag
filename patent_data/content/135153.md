# Process for producing substituted phthalic acid compounds.

## Abstract
A process for producing a substituted phthalic acid which comprises heating a substituted tetrahydrophthalic acid compound having a substituent in at least one of the 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 positions in the presence of sulfur to dehyd rogenate it, and heat treating the product in the presence of water optionally together with an organic solvent. As required, the heat treated product is dehydrocyclized to form a substituted phthalic acid anhydride.
