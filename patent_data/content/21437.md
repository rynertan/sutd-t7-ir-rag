# Process for S chloromethylation of organic dithiophospho compounds with methylene chloride.

## Abstract
An economical process for the controlled S chloromethylation of O alkyl esters of dithiophospho acid compounds with methylene chloride is provided by conducting the reaction in a liquid medium comprising a large excess of methylene chloride and a substantial, reaction promoting proportion of a highly polar, miscible, organic cosolvent.
