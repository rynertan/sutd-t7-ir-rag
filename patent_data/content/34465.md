# Address buffer circuit.

## Abstract
In an active period ACT the gddress buffer circuit pro vides a pair of complementary signals A and AB, for example for selecting a memory cell of a memory device, the levels of which depend upon an address input signal A The address buffer circuit has a MOS transistor T₁₆, con nected between the output terminals N₁ and N₂. During a stand by period STB the transistor T₁₆ electrically connects the two terminals N₁ and N₂ so that the two terminals achieve a common level intermediate between high H and low L levels provided at the output terminals during an active period ACT .
