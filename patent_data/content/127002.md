# A METHOD FOR MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF A DUAL MICROPROCESSOR MULTIPROCESSING COMPUTING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A dual microprocessor computing system is used to control an engine in a motor vehicle. Each system contains a Personality Programmable Read Only Memory PPROM 44 containing system calibration data that is transferred from the PPROM to the read write memories 84 in the micro processors 26, 28 . In order to identify each PPROM a byte of memory contains a check sum and a byte of the micro processor memory contains an identical check sum. During data transfer, the check sums are compared. Also during data transfer, the amount of data being transferred within a predetermined interval is counted both at the transmitter and the receiver memories.
