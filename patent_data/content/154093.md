# Apparatus and method for packaging box flats.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method by which a single operator, at a single station 45 can pack pre counted slugs 25, 26 of flat folded cartons, or trays 23 in one or more layers, in corrugated cases 27 for discharge to a case taper 183 several times faster than with manual packing by several operators. The flats 23 are advanced in a longitudinal path 31 on a secondary apron 28 of a stacker 21 , erect on one edge 37 , pre counted and divided into slugs 25, 26 , so that the single operator can slide each slug 25,26 longitu dinally past a one way back stop 46 onto a transfer table 47 . The slug 25, 26 may be turned on its longitudinal axis by the operator for inspection and then compressed longitu dinally by a ram 73,74 against the back stop 46 . The operator has already been presented with a single, flat, tubular case 27 , from a stack 97 of such cases, with the leading flaps 147 folded back, and has manually erected the case 27 and inserted it in a case gripper 107 preferably poised above the table 47 , thereby closing the minor bottom closure flaps 143, 144 . A start button 138 brings the case gripper 107 down to the level 70 of the transfer table 47 so that the operator can push the compressed slug 25, 26 laterally into the open case 119 , resting on its side wall in the case gripper 107 . The case 119 is automatically lowered to receive the next slug 26 and when full, is turned on a longitudinal axis through 90 onto its bottom and discharged to a case taper 183 while the case gripper 107 returns to its original position above the level 70 of the transfer table 47 .

## Description
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PBSLCLGINO BOX FISTS The art of manufacturing flat, glued, folded paper boxes, termed flats herein, has progressed to the extent that folding and gluing machines produce the same at such high speed that it becomes a problem for the packaging operators, at the end of the stacking aprons, to keep up with production.The flits advance along the stacker apron, or conveyor, in shingled formation, with every 50th flat counted and displaced slightly laterally out of the longitudinal shingled formation, so that the packaging operators can visually note what is called herein a lift, of fifty flats, or some other desired number thereof, reach over the stacking apron and grip between both hands as many as constitute a convenient lift and carry successive lifts manually over into an empty carton, until a slug, or row, is achieved in the carton.It will be apparent that a slug of one or more lifts of fifty flats is normally more than one operator can handle in one trip and is like an accordian in that if great compression pressure is not used, or if one part of each flat is extra thick to form a bulge, or if the operator, usually a woman, becomes tired or careless a slug can easily become deformed and the flats fall all over the floor. While picking up such flats, the stacker continues to feed shingled flats to the operator so that the need for a practical packaging apparatus, capable of handling entire slugs at a time, becomes apparent to assure against such mishaps and to match the speed of production.It has been proposed in U.S. Patent 3,943,681 to Preisig of March 16, 1976 to position a plurality of stacked flats on a slidable closure, and over a container, and to then open the closure to drop the flats into the container.It has also been proposed in U.S. Patent 4,141,193 toJoa of February 27, 1979 to advance a group of diapers along a path up to a back stop fixed at the end of the path, a compression ram being poised outside the path but movable by power into the path to compress the diapers. The compressed diapers are then power rammed laterally into a funnel and thence into an empty carton lying on its side. There appears to be no space at the compression station for an operator to inspect quality.There have been many proposed machines for automatically receiving filled packages and inserting such packages into cartons. Rowever, such machines wauld not be acceptable in the folding paper box art because, despite the high speed production of a folding and gluing machine, it is considered essential that an operator have an opportunity to inspect each slug, or group, of glued flats, to turn the slug over and remove any defectively glued flats before permitting the slug to be packed in a shipping carton.Applicant is aware of a tear sheet entitled JAGENBERG with heading in English Simple Folding Box PackingStation BFA 1, suited for sil folding box gluers, for higher outputs with only one operator at the delivery end believed to be of 1971 vintage. It is not known how this machine was intended to operate, or whether it reached the market, but the empty cases are right side up on an upper chain, out of reach of an operator. The slugs may move down around a curved path through an angle of 90. as in Jagenberg Patents to Klapp, t .S. 4,249,360 of 1981. The empty cases are already erected with the bottom flaps closed, while the empty cases, handled in this invention, are in flat, open tubular tcrr to avoid use of excessive storage space.In this invention, the cartons, or trays, are delivered in flat, freed form, at high speed, by the cor ventional stacker apron of a folder gluer onto a secondary apron travelling at a slower speed and are caused to advance thereon, erect on one edge, pre counted, with the count visible by, for example, each fiftieth flat projecting laterally from the advancing stack.The term lift is used herein to mean the number of flats an operator can lift between her hands and repeatedly carry frqm a stacker apron over to an empty packing case without undue exhaustion and physical Strain during a day s Work. The term slug is used herein to mean the number of such flats which fills an entire row in an empty packing case, and such a glug is normally too heavy, clumsy, and elongated for an operator to lift and carry between her hands.The number of flats in a lift or slug varies with the stock, area, and weight of the type of flats being run.In this invention, the slugs are handled as units, without separation into carryable lifts, and are always supported on a surface while slid therealong or even when being turned for inspection.A slug transfer table is provided, in the longitudinal path of the advancing flats, at the end of the secondary apron, so that the operator can grasp the leading slug, slide the slug past a backstop onto the transfer table and either release it, to be held between the compressor ram and the rear gate backstop, or, if necessary, turn it 9C for inspection of adhesion and folding.Upon the operator releasing the slug to the compressor ram on the far side and the backstop on the near side, she actuates the powered ram to compress the slug against the backstop.A case presenter, within easy reach of the operator, presents flat, folded, tubular, corrugated cases, with the leading closure flaps folded back, individually and successively, to the operator, who grips the endmost case by the corners, erects it into an open tube and inserts it into the case gripper of a case turner unit.The case gripper is preferably poised at a level above the level of the transfer table and includes a support tongue for forming a temporary barrier closing the bottom minor flaps of the case and includes guides for holding the top minor flaps open with the case on its side and its opening facing the operator.A start button pressed by the operator brings the case gripper and its case down to the level of the transfer table so that the operator can actuate a push bar to push the compressed, and inspected, lift into the case. If another layer of flats is to be inserted in the case, the case turner unit automatically brings the case gripper down to a second level for receiving a second layer. It then automatically turns the filled case back to rest on its bottom, closes the bottom major flaps, closes the minor top flats, and ejects the case to a bottom and top taping machine.The parts all then resume their original position for the next cycle with the case gripper returning to its location above the transfer table ready to receive the next case. By the apparatus and method of the invention, a single operator has ample time to keep up with the discharge rate of a modern folder gluer and is easily able to grip and erect a flat case and insert it in the case gripper, then grasp a pre counted lift of flats, slide it onto the transfer table, turn it for inspection, compress it, and push the compressed lift into the case in the case gripper, and repeat the operation while the next lift is advancing the length of a lift.The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Pig. 1 is a front elevation of a transfer table and case gripper as viewed from the station of the single operator Fig. 2 is a top plan view of a case packer with parts removed for clarity Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the case packer of Fig. 2 from the filled case discharge side Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the case packer of Figs. 2 and 3 as seen from the left of the operator station andFig. 5 is a diagrammatic representation of the steps of the method of operation by a single operator in inspecting, compressing and inserting pre counted slugs of flats, inlividually and successively, into empty corrugated cases for subsequent taping of top and bottom closure flaps of the cases.A conventional stacker 21 is shown fragmentarily inFig. 5, the stacker having a stacker apron 22 upon which the flats 23 are advanced in shingled formation having been folded and glued at high speed on a folder gluer, not shown, but of well known type. Suitable, well known counting mechanism automatically displaces every fiftieth flat, such as shown at 24, so that the individual, successive slugs 25 and 26 are segmented, and visually separated, into pre counted groups capable of being grasped between the hands of the single operator and usually of such length that, when compressed, the slugs will each fit in a corrugated case 27.A secondary stacker apron 28 is provided, in continuation of apron 22, but having an upper stretch 29 advancing along the longitudinal path 31 at a speed lower than the speed of apron 22, both aprons being driven by a suitable power train connection to the folder gluer, not shown. A hold down belt 32, Big. 4 having a lower stretch 33 advancing in the direction of advance of the flats 23, and a hold down roller 34, are provided above the end roll 35 of the primary apron 22 to assist in raising the advancing flats from shingled formation to upstanding, edge supported, formations as shown at 36 in Figs. 4 and 5.The individual and successive slugs 25 and 26 advance in substantially upright position, supported on secondary apron 28 and resting on their lower edges such as 97, the leading flat 38 leaning slightly rearwardly. Thus, as each close packed slug, such as 25, approaches the operator station 45, the operator can place her left hand on the exposed face 39 of leading flat 38 and her right hand on the rear face 41 of the projecting, fiftieth flat, 24, and slide the segregated slug forwardly past the backstop means 46 onto the transfer table 47 of the slug inspection and compression means 48.The compression means 48 includes the substantially horizontal transfer table 47, in longitudinal extension of, and at substantially the same level as, the upper stretch 29 of secondary stacker apron 28. Table 47 is vertically movable by the scissors type levers 49 and 51 on base 52, that the table, or platform 47, is substantially at the same level as the level of upper stretch 29 of secondary apron 28 and in longitudinal extension of the path 31. Table 47 may be a hydraulically actuated lift table such as manufactured by SouthworthMachine Company of South Portland, Maine.The table or platform 47, is substantially horizontal and includes a backstop end 54, proximate stacker apron stretch 29, an opposite compressor ram end 55, a pusher bar side 56, at the side of the operator station 45 and an opposite slug discharge side 57.The one way backstop means 46 is provided at the backstop end 54 of transfer table 47, in the form of upper, laterally extending one way cantilevered element 59 and lower, laterally extending, one way element 61, both transverse to the longitudinal path 31 of the slugs 25 or 26, but spaced apart by a space 62 sufficient to pass each slug as slid therethrough in the hands of the operator.The upper laterally, extending, one way cantilevered element 59 can be a rod 63 only, the operator merely tilting the slug rearwardly to pass it through the space 62 and then shifting the flats to vertical to be compressed against the rod 63.The upper one way backstop element 59 can also be a gate, pivotally mounted from a rod 63, cantilevered above the path 31 and vertically adjustable relative to an upright post 64, there being a stop 8o that it will swing in the direction of movement of the slug from the stacker apron onto the transfer table, bus will not swing rearwardly when the slug is compressed thereagainst. However, it is preferred that the upper, one way backstop element 59 comprises a row of leaf springs, such as 65, each extending downvardly,at a slight angle, from the cantilevered rod 63 and each having a roller 66 at its free terminal end, so that the slug will raise the springs 65 and rollers 66, in being passed thereunder, but the springs and rollers then spring downwardly behind each trailing flat in the slug to serve as the upper backstop element 59 during compression of the slug. The lower backstop element 61 preferably is a shoulder 67 extending across the path 31, directly below the row of rollers 66 of the cantilevered upper element 59, so that each successive individual slug 25, or 26, slid through the space 62, drops behind the shoulder 67 to enable it to form an immovable, one way, lower backstop against compression. The post 64 is on the slug discharge side 57 of transfer table 47 in order not to interfere with the sliding of the pre counted slugs through the space 62 onto the table 47, ready for inspection, assembly, and compression.The rod 63 is vertically adjustable on post 64 to conform to the height of the slugs 25 or 26 by screw 68 and hand wheel 69 on post 64.Compressor ram means 71 is provided at the compressor ram end 55 of the transfer table 47, and includes a compression head 72 having at least one, and preferably two, spaced apart laterally extending, compressor rams 73 and 74 each with a row 75, or 76, of freely revolvable rollers, such as 77, to reduce friction during push bar discharge of the compressed slugs, Fig. 1 . The compressor rams 73 and 74 are normally retracted, but are movable along the longitudinal path 31 toward the backstop means 46 by pneumatic piston 78 and cylinder 79, to compress each individual and successive slug 25 or 26 when the operator presses a switch 81. A longitudinal slot 82 in transfer table 47 accommodates the connection 85 between the tip of piston 78 and the compression frame 80. Compression head 72 is clamped in place on table 47 by clamp knob 192 to adjust to the length dimension of the cases 27. While all of the power for the apparatus of the invention is preferably hydraulic, the compressor ram power mechanism 84 is pneumatic, so as to be yieldable in case the hands of the operator are inadvertently caught therein. The source of air pressure is a suitable air pump and tank, or mill air, not shown. Push bar means 85 is provided at the push bar side 56 of transfer table 47, adjacent the operator station 45 and consisting of a longitudinslly extending bar 86, having a knob 87, and mounted on a wheeled carriage 88, movable laterally of path 31 on a track 89 in a slot 91 in table 47 Fig. 3 . Slot 91 is formed by a space between the plate 90, forming the shoulder 67 and the underlying surface 70 of transfer table 47.Thus, the single operator at station 45 can slide each slug 25 or 26, through the space 62, of the one way backstop means 46 onto the slug compression and inspection table 47, turn the slug on its longitudinal axis 900 to inspect the folds and adhesion of the flaps snd tabs, turn it back through 900, if desired, press the compressor ram switch 81 to compress the slug against the backst s 59 and 61, and push the compressed slug 92 laterally across the table 47 and off the discharge side 57.Unlike prior art devices in which corrugated cases are provided in erected condition with bottom flaps closed, adhered and taped, to receive the slugs of flats, such cases occupying considerable floor space and usually requiring a second operator on the discharge side of the apparatus, in this invention the corrugated cases are stacked In flat tubular condition, near the operator station 45 as at 93, at case presentation station 94.Case presentation means 95, at case presentation station g4 includes a magazine 96 holding a stack 97 of flat, tubular, corrugated cases 98, the magazine being of the bottom feed type with a gateway 99 for passing one flat case at a time and each successive lowermost individual flat case being advanced through gateway 99 by lugs 101 on a feed chain 102 powered by a suitable.motor and arranged to advance another case to easy reach of the operator, each time the lowermost case is extracted.Suitable back fold hooks 103 and 104 fold back the leading flaps 105 and 106 of each case, as it advances to presentation position, so that the operator can grasp the opposite corners, erect the case into an open tube and insert it into the case gripper 107.Case turning means 108 is located on the slug discharge side 57 of the slug transfer and compression table 47, and includes the case gripper 107, which is normally at a level abode the level of the surface 70 of the table 47. Case turning means 108 is mounted on an hydraulically actuated vertically movable, table 109 having scissors type levers 111 and 112 on a base 113 and being movable from level 0, through level 1, and level 2 to level 3 by the control mechanism 114 as required by the run of flats, and cases.Case gripper 107 includes a right hand turning fork 115, and a left hand turning fork 116, each having one end such as 117 mounted to pivot with a shaft 118 through an angle of 50 Fig. 3 , the forks 115 and 116 being normally horizontal to support an empty case 119 resting on its side wall 121 with its top opening 122 facing the operator at station 45 and facing transfer table 47.Case gripper 107 also includes the support tongue, or backer plate, 123 which is mounted about mid height of the case 119 to close the minor, bottom end flaps of the case, as it is inserted, as an open tube, into the case gripper and to serve as a backer when the compressed slug is pushed into the case. A.leSt hand case side hopper l24 is adjustably mounted on compression head 72 and a right hand case side hopper 125 is adjustably mounted on upright post 64. Each case side hopper includes a pair of arms 126 and 127 having slots such as 128 for bolts such as 129 tightenable in vertical slots such as 131.It will be seen that with the case gripper 107 positioned in its normal position at a level above the level of the transfer table, and directly in rear of the side hoppers 124 and 125, the operator in a single motion can withdraw a flat tubular case by the corners from the case presenter means 95, erect the case into an open tube, push it into the side hoppers arid into the case gripper 107, the backer plate 123 closing the minor bottom flaps of the case and the upper minor end flips being held back, out of the way, by rods such as 137.When the operator presses the sequence start button 138, the case gripper 107 is automatically lowered to the level of surface 70 of table 47, the first load position, with an empty case 119 ready to slidably receive a compressed slug such as 92. Preferably an alignment bar 139 is at this time in raised position along the discharge side 57 of table 47 so that the push bar can align the flats in the slug against the bar 139, whereupon it automatically moves out of the path down into a slot 141 so that the slug may enter the empty case.As best shown in Fig. 3, the sequence control mechanism 114 has four levels, to which it automatically moves the case gripper 107 from its normal level 0, poised above the transfer table to receive an empty case 119, down to level 1, where the side wall 121 is flush horizontally with surface 70 of transfer table 47. If the case 119 is of a predetermined width sufficient to contain two or more slugs, such as 24 or 25, the control mechanism automatically moves the case gripper 107 down to level 2, as soon as the first compressed slug is inserted by the push bar 86, so that the upper edges of the inserted slug are flush horizontally with surface 70 of table 47.A limit switch 142, at the end of the path of the carriage 88 of the push bar 86 signals the control mechanism 114 to lower the case gripper lOT to level 2 or to level 3, if three layers are desired in one case 119.On the other hand, if only one layer, row, or slug of flats is to be inserted in each individual and successive corrugated case 119, the limit switch 142 signals control mechanism 114 to turn the now filled case 119 through an angle of 900 back onto its bottom flaps, and resting on support tongue 123 Fig. 3 . At this point in the cycle the minor bottom flaps 143 and 144 of the case are already infolded, the case is supported on the elongated support tongue 123 and the major bottom flaps 145.and 146 are depending downwardly on each side of tongue 123.The top major flap 147 at opening 122 is sufficiently stiff to remain up and out of the way of insertion of a compressed slug 92 into the interior 148 of an empty case 119, as shown in Fig. 3. The lower top major flap 159, at the opening 122, is folded under the empty case llg. The minor top flaps 151 and 152 at the opening 122, are held back by the rods 137.A pair of gripper rolls 135 and 136, each on an opposite side of case gripper 107, and each rotatable on vertical axis, cooperate with support tongue 123 in maintaining each empty case 119, erect and fully open while the case is being filled. The gripper rolls remain in position, while rotatably contacting the side walls of a filled case, as the support tongue 123, the left hand turning fork 116 and right hand turning fork 115 turn the filled case back to rest on its bottom ready for discharge.As soon as the final slug has been pushed into the empty case, and the case turner means 108 has rotated the filled case 119 through an angle of 90q onto its bottom, it is discharged from the case turning unit along the support tongue 123 by the case pusher 153, which extends upwardly from a wheeled carriage 154, riding in tracks 155 and actuated by a chain 156. Chain 156 has a limit switch 157 and 158, each at an opposite end of its path to cause it to move the carriage, case pusher, and filled case, into a box taper 183, not shown, for taping of the top and bottom flaps.As each filled case 119 is moved along the support tongue 123, the rear bottom flap folder rods 161, 162, and 163, affixed by clamp blocks such as 164, to a rod 165, upfold the rear major bottom flap 145. The folding of the rear bottom flaps 145, against the underface 172 of the support tongue 123, is completed by the lateral advance of the rear Slap closer bar 166 carried by gear racks 167 slideable in tracks 168 and meshed with spur gear 169 on driven, shaft 171. . The front major bottom flap 146 is upfolded against the other side of the under face 172 of the support tongue 123, by the deflectors 173 and by the lateral advance of the front flap closer bar 174 carried by gear racks 175, slideable in tracks 176, and meshed with spur gears 177 on driven shaft 178.The presser roll 179 cooperates with the underface 172 of support tongue 123 in holding the lower major bottom flaps 145 and 146 closed as the case 119 is advanced along the tongue 123.A top rear flap closer 181 extends in advance of the case pusher 153 to engage the top minor rear flap 152 first and downfold it before the filled case is engaged by the pusher 153. An elongated top front minor flap closer 182 extends along the path of the case. being moved by the case pusher 153 to down fold flap 151 as the case advances towards the box taper. The rear flap closer 181 advances with the case pusher 153 to hold down rear flap 152 until it passes under flap closer 182, whereupon the box taper, 183 which is of well known, commercially available, construction,closes over the top major flaps and applies adhesive tape along the top and bottom central seams of the filled case 119 in the usual manner.All of the above operations are controlled and sequenced by the control mechanism 114.The case gripper rolls 135 and 136 shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are rubber covered and each is provided with a one way clutch such as indicated at 134. Thus, the operator caneasiiy push the case into the grip of the rolls, with the clutch allowing rotation in the direction of advance without damage to the case, and once seated in the case gripper the case cannot bounce back toward the operator. Similarly, the case turning forks 115 and 116 can turn the filled case bsok onto its bottom by overpowering the spit, resilient tension of the gripper rolls 135 and 136, together with the cooperation of the one way clutches during the compound motion of the case in its rearward curved path. In its most simplified form the apparatus of the invention may consist only of the transfer table with one way backstopi or gate, means 46.at one end and an upstanding support at the other end, the case gripper being located at the loading level qf the transfer.table. Thus, the operator would grasp each successive individual slug between the hands, slide it past the oneway gate onto the transfer table, turn it for inspection if necessary, manually compress it and slide it into the case gripper. The pivoted forks and support tongue would then turn through 900 to rest the filled case on its bottom ready for discharge to the taper. However, powered compression and automatic vertical movement of the case gripper is much preferred.
