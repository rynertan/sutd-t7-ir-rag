## Description
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a cold rolled steel sheet suitable for use in parts such as automotive bodies and so on which require press formability, and in particular deep drawability. More particularly, the careful application of such a continuous annealing process allows the effective manufacture of cold rolled steel sheet which has a high ductility, small anisotropy in material, excellent deep drawability and resistance to ageing and secondary brittleness. In general, press formable steel sheets have hitherto been manufactured by a box annealing process using a low carbon Aℓ killed steel C 0.02 0.07 by weight abbreviated as hereinafter as a starting material. Recently they have been manufactured by a continuous annealing process using extremely low carbon steel C 0.01 as the starting material in order to obtain better press formability and higher productivity. In such extremely low carbon steels, carbonitride forming elements such as Ti, Nb, V, Zr, Ta and the like are added in order to fix any C and N soluted in steel, which would otherwise deteriorate the ductility, drawability and aging resistance of the steel sheet. Conventionally these elements were frequently added alone since they are expensive. A comparison between properties of Ti and Nb, which are most popularly used, is as explained below. Ti containing steel has the advantage that the recrystallisation temperature is low, and the mechanical properties such as total elongation Eℓ , Lankford value On the other hand, Nb containing steel has the advantage that the anisotropy of the r value is small, and the phosphate treating property as a pretreatment for painting is good, in comparison with Ti containing steel. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 58 107,414 discloses the development of the advantages of both Ti and Nb simultaneously. In this case, the upper limit of the Ti is restricted to an amount given by the expression 48 12 C 48 14 N , which is intended to prevent ageing and ensure deep drawability since a greater part of the Ti is consumed as TiN and the solute C is fixed with the remaining effective Ti effective Ti total Ti Ti as TiN and Nb. In the manufacture of outer parts of automotive vehicles by press forming, stretch forming is mainly carried out rather than drawing. Thus, steel sheets having high ductility are of commercial significance. However, the Eℓ value of steels used in this technique lies within the range of 46.8 48.1 corresponding to that of mild steel sheet , which does not correspond to a satisfactory level of elongation. It has been found by experiment that when the effective Ti range is in accordance with that used in the above technique, the C in steel is not effectively bonded to Ti. This results in considerable deterioration in ductility and drawability, as well as deterioration in ageing property resistance on account of the remaining solute C. EPA 0 108 268 discloses a method for the production of cold rolled steel sheet having deep drawability by the combined addition of specified amounts of Ti and Nb given by the expressions 48 14 N 0.002 Ti 4 C 3.43 N , 0.003 0.025 Nb Nb 2.33 C and Nb Ti 0.04 . Steel sheet obtained by this method had the further benefit of a small anisotropy of the r value. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing cold rolled steel sheet which has better deep drawability, by exploiting the beneficial effects of adding both Ti and Nb. The inventors have performed various investigations into a method of manufacturing cold rolled steel sheet from extremely low carbon steel containing both Ti and Nb. It is desirable that the steel sheet should possess all the advantageous properties associated with the aforementioned extremely low carbon steels, notably the features of a good press formability, in particular a good deep drawability, a high ductility, a small anisotropy in material, and improved ageing resistance and resistance to secondary brittleness. The inventors have examined the effect of adding both Ti and Nb in detail, and have found that in the slab reheating step or hot roughing rolling step, the TiS and TiN are preferentially precipitated and the solute C is fixed with the remaining effective Ti and Nb in lower temperature region such as the hot finishing rolling step and after coiling. It has been found that the effective amount of Ti needed may be represented by an equation in which the effective Ti total Ti Ti as TiN Ti as TiS. Thus, steel sheets which are suitable as press formable steel sheets are first obtained by limiting the amount of each of C, N, S, Ti and Nb in extremely low carbon steel and strictly controlling the cooling conditions in the hot rolling, heating and cooling stages during continuous annealing. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a cold rolled steel sheet having a good deep drawability, which comprises hot rolling a sheet of steel having a composition comprising not more than 0.0035 of C, not more than 1.0 of Si, not more than 1.0 of Mn, 0.005 0.10 of Aℓ, not more than 0.15 of P, not more than 0.0035 of N, not more than 0.015 of S, 48 14 N 48 32 S According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a cold rolled steel sheet having a good deep drawability, which comprises hot rolling a sheet of steel having a composition comprising not more than 0.0035 of C, not more than 1.0 of Si, not more than 1.0 of Mn, 0.005 0.10 of Aℓ, not more than 0.15 of P, not more than 0.0035 of N, not more than 0.015 of S, 4. C N 3. 48 12 C 48 14 N 48 32 S of Ti and 0.2. 93 12 C 93 12 C of Nb with the balance being iron and incidental elements and impurities For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made by way of example only, to the following drawings in which In order to fully appreciate the effects of adding Ti and Nb according to the invention, it is necessary to limit the composition of the starting material. The details of the invention are illustrated by the following experimental results. Each of 18 steels having a chemical composition of trace 0.02 of Si, 0.10 0.12 of Mn, 0.007 0.010 of P, 0.02 0.04 of Aℓ, 0.0027 of N, 0.0020 of C, 0.006 , 0.013 or 0.018 of S, 0.015 , 0.025 or 0.034 of Ti, and 0.008 or 0.020 of Nb was produced by melting in a laboratory, and bloomed into a sheet bar having a thickness of 30 mm, hot rolled to a thickness of 2.8 mm at seven passes and then finally rolled at a temperature of 900 5 C. The resulting steel sheet was cooled to a temperature of 550 C at a rate of 35 C sec by means of a water spray 0.8 second after the completion of final rolling. Then, the cooled steel sheet was immediately charged into a furnace at 550 C, held at this temperature for 5 hours and subjected to furnace cooling. A coiling temperature of 550 C was simulated by this furnace cooling. Thereafter, the cooled steel sheet was subjected to cold rolling at a reduction of 75 , following pickling. Subsequently, the cold rolled steel sheet was subjected to continuous annealing, wherein it was heated to 700 C at a heating rate of 12 C sec by means of a resistance heater, further heated to 780 C at a heating rate of 3 C sec, held at 780 C for 25 seconds and cooled to room temperature at a cooling rate of 5 C sec. Then, the resulting steel sheet was subjected to a skin pass rolling of 0.7 and thereafter submitted to a tensile test. The As seen from the results in Figs. 1 and 2, the properties in each of the experimental steels largely vary in accordance with the amounts of Ti, S and Nb. If the values of r 1.6 and AI 3.0 are considered standard for the properties required for a press formable steel sheet, both the above inequalities are satisfied within a region of However, it is found that even when the same amounts of C and Nb are present the drawability and the ageing resistance are deteriorated as the amount of S increases consequently an increase in the amount of Ti present corresponding to the increase in S is required. On the other hand, the effect of increasing the amount of Nb present is to reduce the value of AI, the ageing resistance, even when the amount of Ti is small and the amount of S is large. However an increase in the amount of Nb present hardly results in any improvement of the Turning now to the hot rolling conditions, the slab heating temperature prior to hot rolling is not particularly restricted, but it must not be more than 1,280 C for fixing S and N with Ti, preferably not more than 1,230 C, and more preferably not more than 1,150 C. Incidentally, the same effect can be expected even when the slab is subjected to so called direct rolling, or a sheet bar of about 30 mm in thickness obtained by casting is subjected to hot rolling as such. The final temperature in the hot rolling is preferably not less than the Ar₃ point. However, even if it is lowered to about 700 C in the α region, the degradation of properties is small. Incidentally, the grain size of ferrite α in the hot rolled steel sheet largely varies in accordance with the change of cooling pattern from completion of the final rolling to the coiling. In general, when the cooling rate from completion of final rolling to strip coiling is slow, α grains become coarse. In the Ti, Nb composite added steel according to the present invention, this tendency becomes especially noticeable. As the α grains become coarser, not only is the intergranular area reduced, hence the 111 structure is not developed after annealing and the Good properties can be obtained even when the coiling temperature is not greater than 600 C, however, the properties are more improved when the high temperature coiling is carried out above 600 C. The effect on the improvement of properties is saturated when the coiling temperature exceeds 710 C and also the descaling property is considerably deteriorated. Therefore, the upper limit is restricted to 710 C. In order to improve drawability it is required that the draft in the cold rolling after the descaling is not less than 50 , preferably 70 90 . Insofar, as the continuous annealing conditions are concerned the Ti and Nb amounts are restricted in accordance with the C, N and S amounts as previously mentioned, such that steel sheets having considerably good deep drawability, good ageing resistance and anisotropy can be produced. However, the restriction of only these elements does not improve the resistance to secondary brittleness to a sufficient extent. For example, formable steel sheets such as those intended by the present invention are frequently used in deeply formed portions such as automobile high roofs, engine oil pans and the like. Therefore it is essential to improve the resistance to secondary brittleness. When the resistance to secondary brittleness is poor, the steel sheet is broken by strong shock after press forming and this is clearly undesirable in view of vehicle body safety. The addition of B boron , Sb antimony or the like is considered as a method of improving the resistance to secondary brittleness. However, there are problems such as the recrystallisation temperature rises in the boron case and the cost increases in both cases. These problems are solved in the present invention by combining cooling control in the hot rolling, as previously mentioned, with heating control in the continuous annealing, as mentioned later. The heating rate from 400 to 600 C during heating must be not less than 5 C sec. This restriction is required due to the fact that the solute P in steel is considerably prone to causing intergranular segregation in such a temperature region. Rapid heating is performed to prevent the intergranular segregation of P, whereby the intergranular strength is enhanced to improve the resistance to secondary brittleness. In the region of 600 400 C during cooling, the resistance to secondary brittleness is good without the need for any particular restriction, as there is in the heating stage. However, if quenching is performed at a cooling rate of not less than 10 C sec in such a temperature region, the resistance to secondary brittleness is more improved. It is essential that the soaking is carried out at not less than 700 C over the period of one second in order to ensure the deep drawability of the steel after continuous annealing. On the other hand, when the heating temperature exceeds Ac₃ point about 920 930 C , the deep drawability suddenly deteriorates, hence the heating temperature must be restricted to 700 C Ac₃ point. The following examples are given as an illustration of the invention and are not intended as limitations thereof. A steel having a chemical composition of C 0.0024 , Si 0.01 , Mn 0.17 , P 0.011 , S 0.005 , Aℓ 0.037 , N 0.0021 , Ti 0.022 48 14 N 48 32 S 0.0147 Ti 3. 48 12 C 48 14 N 48 32 S 0.0435 , Nb 0.011 0.2 93 12 C 0.0372 Nb 1.0. 93 12 C 0.0186 , and other inevitable impurities was tapped out from a converter, subjected to an RH degassing treatment, and continuously cast into a slab. Then, the resulting slab was reheated to 1,160 C and finally hot rolled at 900 C. One second thereafter, the hot rolled steel sheet was rapid cooled on a hot runout table at a rate of 35 C sec and then coiled at 530 C. The sheet was then subjected to pickling and cold rolled at a draft of 80 . The heating rate from 400 to 600 C in the continuous annealing was varied as shown in Table 1. In this case, the cold rolled steel sheet was heated to 400 C at a heating rate of 15 C sec and to 600 795 C at a rate of 4 C sec, and subjected to soaking at 795 C for 40 seconds, after which the heated sheet was cooled from 795 C to 600 C at a cooling rate of 1.5 C sec and in the region of not more than 600 C at rate of 5 C sec. The results obtained after 0.5 skin pass rolling are shown in Table 1. As seen from Table 1, the resistance to secondary brittleness is improved, without deteriorating the Test steel sheets A N, each having a chemical composition as shown in Table 2, were produced under hot rolling conditions as shown in Table 2. In this case, the production conditions except continuous annealing conditions were the same as in Example 1. The continuous annealing conditions were as follows the steel sheet was heated to 400 C at a rate of 13 C sec, from 400 C to 650 C at a rate of 6 C sec and from 650 C to 810 C at a rate of 3 C sec, and soaked at 810 C for 20 seconds, and thereafter cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 C sec. Continuous annealing was carried out according to the heatcycle as shown in Table 1, and the soaking conditions and so were the same as in Example 1. The mechanical properties of the resulting products after 0.5 skin pass rolling are shown in the following Table 3. The amount of carbon C in Comparative Steels B, C and O, the amounts of nitrogen N and sulphur S in Comparative Steels D and E, and the amount of Ti and Nb in relation to the amounts of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur in Comparative Steels F, G, H and I were outside the ranges defined by the present invention, respectively. These comparative steels had poor properties. Steels A, I and P and Steels L and M are examples of soft steel and high tensile steel sheet according to the first and second aspects of the present invention, respectively. In Steel J, the amount of Ti is somewhat lower than that in Steel P, but the other conditions are almost the same. Therefore, Steel J represents an example of the first aspect of the present invention. Accordingly, good properties were obtained in not only the mild steel sheet TS 343.2 MPa 35 kg mm ² but also in the high tensile steel sheet containing a strengthening element such as P, Mn or the like. According to the present invention, it is possible to produce steel sheets satisfying all the conditions required for a press formable steel sheet such as those used for automobile bodies or the like, whose reliability is utmost.
