# IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO PROCESSING PHOTOSENSITIVE FILM

## Abstract
The invention provides an apparatus 2 202 and a method for processing bulk quantities photo sensitive film originally contained in a cassette. The arrangement is concerned with a controlled source of illumination 10 224 which is initially actuated to permit recognition and identification of the cassette and the film contained therein, but to be automatically extinguished prior to removal of the photo sensitive film from the cassette for association by splicing with the content of other cassettes to enable continuous processing and development of con tinuous lengths of film to be achieved. A control system 38,46,48 224 automatically ensures extinguishment of the source 10 224 before opening of the cassette is completed, thereby preventing exposure of the film prior to processing. A safety interlock 52 112 may be provided to prevent actuation of the source after the opening thereof is sealed within a light tight enclosure 26 220 .
