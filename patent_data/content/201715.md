## Description
This invention relates to a surface treated polyester film. More specifically, it relates to a coated polyester film having superior adhesion and solvent resistance which is useful as a substrate for extensively processed products of polyester films, such as magnetic tapes for audio, video and computer applications, floppy discs, and radiographic films. It is known to form films by melt extruding thermoplastic polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate or copolymers therefore, polyethylene naphthalate or copolymers thereof, or blends of these polyesters with a minor proportion of other resins. It is also known that biaxially stretched heat set polyester films have better heat resistance, gas barrier property, electrical properties and chemical resistance than films of other resins. On the other hand, since the surfaces of the polyester films are highly crystallized and oriented, they have the defect that their surfaces have high cohesiveness and poor receptivity of paints, adhesives, inks, etc. When it is desired to form a synthetic resin layer on the surface of such a polyester film, it is the practice to subject its surface to a corona discharge treatment, an ultraviolet irradiation treatment, a plasma treatment or a flame treatment in advance for firm adhesion between the two, and thereafter apply a coating of the synthetic resin to the so activated surface. By this surface activating means, it is expected to obtain increased adhesion owing to the increased secondary bonding force of the film surface attributed to increased wetting with the coated layer, but this activity of the film surface decreases with time. Hence, this surface activating means has not proved to be entirely satisfactory. Another method proposed to increase the receptivity of the surface of the polyester film is an etching method whereby the film surface is swollen or partially dissolved with various chemicals. By this method, it is intended to increase the adhesion between the film surface and a resin to be applied to it by bringing the film surface into contact with chemicals having the ability to swell or dissolve the polyester, such as acids, alkalies, aqueous amine solutions, or trichloroacetic acid thereby to locally reduce the crystaline orientation of the polyester near its surface and simultaneously reduce the cohesiveness of the surface. The effect of this method is accurate and the adhesion between the film surface and a layer to be formed on it, for example a synthetic resin coated layer, becomes firm. Some of the chemicals used in this method are toxic and may involve danger in handling. Or they are likely to dissipate into the atmospheric air. Utmost cares, therefore, are necessary to avoid pollution of the working environment, and this method is disadvanageous in practical applications. A similar method has been proposed which comprises forming a primer layer on the base film surface, forming a thin surface layer dissimilar to the base film, and thereafter, coating a desired layer such as a synthetic resin layer. The formulation of the primer is usually effected in a separate step independently of the polyester film forming process. If polyester films having such an adhesive surface have surface defects due to dust and dirt, they cannot be used as bases for applications where precise and elaborate qualities must be maintained, for example for extensively processed products of films such as magnetic tapes for audio, video and computer applications, floppy discs, radiographic films, photographic films for printing and diazo microfilms. The surface defects, however, are liable to occur in this separate step. It is desirable therefore to apply the primer in an atmosphere having a minimum of dust and dirt. One atmosphere which met this requirement is that in which the polyester film is formed. If the primer treatment is carried out in this film forming process, it would be possible to obtain a product which is feasible for use in extensively processed film products. On the other hand, the method of increasing the adhesion of the surface of the polyester film by the primer treatment in the prior art is, in many cases, achieved by coating a primer composition in an organic solvent on the surface portion of the film. When such a method is practiced during the film producing process, the organic solvent will dissipate to pollute the environment and reduce its safety and hygiene and consequently exert adverse effects on the film forming process. The amount of the organic solvent used should therefore be minimized. Accordingly, when the in line primer treatment is carried out in the film forming process, the use of a primer composition containing water as a solvent is desirable in view of economy and safety and the ease of the treatment step. Many primer compositions using water as a solvent have been proposed, and especially many aqueous solutions or dispersions of polyurethane or polyesters have been proposed. For example, DE A 1694062 discloses the use of a primer composition of polyurethane having solvent resistance to acetone and dispersibility in water. These primer compositions, however, are swellable with, or soluble in, solvents used e.g. in magnetic coating compositions, such as methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone and tetrahydrofuran, and have insufficient solvent resistance. When a highly polar paint such as a magnetic paint is coated on a layer formed by using such a primer composition, the primer layer gets mixed with the magnetic layer to reduce the adhesiveness of the primer layer, and flow marks occur on the surface of the coated layer. In recent years, the density of recording on coated magnetic recording media has become higher, and the magnetic layer has tended to decrease in thickness. In particular, thickness reduction has rapidly been effected in floppy discs, and the thickness of the magnetic layer is now about 1 micrometer. With such a thin magnetic layer, the occurrence of flow marks makes it difficult to obtain a good magnetic surface, and deteriorates its electromagnetic conversion characteristics. EP A 135 982 D1 discloses a process for producing a polyester film wherein a coating composition comprising a self crosslinkable polyurethane PUR and a pulverulent surface roughening substance is applied to at least one surface of the polyester film before its crystallisation and orientation are completed in order to form a crosslinked coating film on the substrate. GB A 2 079 192 D2 discloses a similar process which results in a coated polyester film to be used in the production of e. g. magnetic recording media. Document D1 aims at improving slippability of one surface of a polyester film on the opposite side of its magnetic layer coated surface, which differs clearly from the present invention aiming at improving adhesion to the magnetic layer. The process of document D1 cannot achieve the improvement of adhesion to the magnetic layer. Further, the coated polyester film of document D2 has the defect that its surface has no good solvent resistance. It is an object of this invention to provide a polyester film having coated thereon a primer layer which has excellent adhesion to various coatings to be formed on it, for example a cellophane ink, a magnetic paint, a gelatin composition, an offset ink, an electrophotographic toner, a chemical mat paint, a diazo paint, a heat seal imparting composition, or an inorganic film forming substance, does not develop flow marks when such a coating is formed on it, and which has stable solvent resistance not affected by the coating and drying conditions. Another object of this invention is to provide a desirable process for producing such a surface treated polyester film. According to this invention, there is provided a biaxially oriented linear saturated aromatic polyester film having on at least one surface thereof a primer layer comprising a crosslinked product of a polyurethane having at least one functional group selected from a carboxyl group, a sulfo group, a hemisulfate group, and salts of these groups and a polyepoxy compound. The polyester film base on which the primer layer is formed in this invention includes films of linear saturated polyesters synthesized essentially from aromatic dibasic acids or ester forming derivatives thereof and diols or ester forming derivatives thereof. Specific examples of such polyesters are polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene isophthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, poly 1,4 cyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate , polyethylene 2,6 naphthalenedicarboxylate, copolymers of these, and blends of these with a minor proportion preferably up to 5 by weight of other miscible thermofusible resins e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene . Of these, polyethylene terephthalate is especially suitable for use in this invention. The base polyester film on which the primer layer is to be formed is obtained by melt extruding such a linear saturated polyester resin into a film form in a customary manner, and crystallizing it by orientation and heat treatment. The polyester film is crystalline oriented to such a degree that it has a heat of fusion, measured by a scanning calorimeter in a nitrogen stream at a temperature elevating rate of 10 C min., of usually at least 16,7 J g 4 cal g . A polyester film whose center line average surface roughness Ra is adjusted to the range of 0.004 to 0.02 micrometer by including fine titanium oxide particles having an average particle diameter of not more than 0.5 micrometer, particularly 0.1 to 0.4 micrometer, is especially suitably used as a base film in this invention. Inclusion of titanium oxide may be effected usually by adding fine particles of titanium oxide preferably as a slurry in glycol to the reaction system during the polyester forming reaction, for example at any desired time during ester interchange reaction or polycondensation reaction in the ester interchange method or at any desired time in the direct polymerization method. Preferably, the fine particles of titanium oxide are added to the reaction system in the early stage of polycondensation, for example before the inherent viscosity, measured in o chlorophenol at 25 C, of the polymer reaches about 0.3. The center line average surface roughness Ra of the polyester film is preferably not more than 0.02 micrometer in order to secure the smoothness of the magnetic layer. Ra is measured in accordance with JIS B0601 as follows By using a needle contacting type surface roughness tester SURFCOM 3B the surface roughness curve of a sample film is drawn on a chart under a load of 0.07 g using a needle with a radius of 2 µm. A part having a measured length of L is picked up from the surface roughness curve in a direction along the center line of the curve. Let the center line of the picked up part be X axis and the longitudinal direction, Y axis, the roughness curve is expressed by Y f x . The value Ra micrometers given by the following equation is defined as the surface roughness of the film. In the present invention the measured length L is made 0.25 mm, and eight surface roughnesses are measured. The three largest values were excluded, and Ra is determined as an average of the remaining five measured values. According to this invention, a primer layer comprising a crosslinked product of a polyurethane containing at least one functional group selected from a carboxyl group COOH , a sulfo group SO₃H , a hemisulfate group OSO₃H and salts of these COOM The polyurethane having the above functional group can be obtained usually by using a monomer having such a functional group as one material for the synthesis of polyurethane, or by a method comprising introducing such a functional group by utilizing terminal isocyanate groups or other reactive groups that may be present in the polyurethane. For example, a polyurethane containing a carboxyl group or its salt can be obtained by using a carboxyl containing polyhydroxy compound as one starting polyhydroxy compound in the synthesis of polyurethane or by reacting a hydroxyl containing carboxylic acid or an amino containing carboxylic acid with the isocyanate groups of an isocyanate terminated polyurethane, and as required, adding the reaction product to an aqueous solution of a base with stirring at high speeds to neutralize it. A polyurethane having the sulfo group or the hemisulfate group or a salt thereof can be produced usually by reacting a polyhydroxy compound, a polyisocyanate and a chain extender to form an isocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer, reacting it with a compound having in the molecule an amino or hydroxyl group and a sulfo group or hemisulfate group or a salt thereof which can react with the terminal isocyanate groups to give a polyurethane having the sulfo or hemisulfate group or a salt thereof in the molecule, and when the functional group is in free acid form, treating the functional group with an aqueous solution of a base to covert it to a salt. Preferably, the urethane prepolymer forming reaction is carried out in the absence of solvent, and then water is added. Another method comprises synthesizing a polyurethane having the sulfo group using a compound having the sulfo group as one starting material, and as required, adding the polyurethane to an aqueous solution of a base with stirring at high speeds to neutralize it. A polyurethane having the sulfo group or its salt may also be obtained by combining a sultone compound with a primary or secondary amino group that may exist in the main chain or side chain of polyurethane by addition reaction in the presence of an alkali to thereby introduce an alkali sulfonate group such as SO₃Na .

Two film pieces, 15 cm 20 cm in size, are cut off from a polyester film having the primer layer formed thereon. The film pieces are laid one on top of the other so that the primer layers contact each other. The film assembly is maintained at 40 C for 2 hours under a load of 50 kg cm², and then T peeled 15 cm in the width direction at a rate of 100 mm min. The force required to effect the T peel is measured, and defined as the blocking force g 15 cm . The primer layer in accordance with this invention can be formed by coating a liquid mixture of the polyurethane and the polyepoxy compound on at least one surface of the polyester base film, and crosslinking the polyurethane. The liquid mixture may be a solvent type composition in an organic solvent. In the present invention, it is advantageously prepared as an aqueous coating composition by dissolving or dispersing it in an aqueous medium utilizing the functional group of the polyurethane. The aqueous coating composition can be prepared by dissolving and or dispersing the polyurethane having the functional group in salt form and the polyepoxy compound in an aqueous medium or adding the polyurethane having the functional group in free form and the polyepoxy compound to an aqueous medium, and neutralizing the functional group of the polyurethane with the aforesaid base to dissolve and or disperse the polyurethane and the polyepoxy compound in the aqueous medium. Prior to use, a surface active agent such as an anionic or nonionic surfactants may be added as a surface wetting improver in a required amount to the aqueous coating composition.

Examples include polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, glycerin fatty acid esters, fatty acid metal soaps, alkylsulfuric acid salts, alkylsulfonic acid salts, and alkylsulfosuccinic acid salts. The aqueous coating composition may, as required, further contain other additives such as anti static agents, ultraviolet absorbers, pigments, organic fillers, inorganic fillers, lubricants and antiblocking agents so long as they do not reduce the effect of the present invention. Furthermore, a compound which promotes crosslinking reaction between the polyurethane containing the functional group and the polyepoxy compound to be referred to as the reaction promoting compound in the present specification . Examples of the reaction promoting compound include compounds containing a basic tertiary amino group, heterocyclic compounds having a tertiary nitrogen atom, salts of the heterocyclic compounds, and quaternary ammonium compounds.

The polyester film before its crystallization and orientation are completed , as used herein includes, for example, an unstretched film obtained by heat melting the polyester and molding it into a film form a monoaxially oriented film obtained by stretching the unstretched film either longitudinally or transversely and a biaxially stretched film obtained by stretching the unstretched film at low stretch ratios both longitudinally and transversely before it is finally re stretched longitudinally or transversely to complete its crystallization and orientation . The aqueous primer coating composition may be coated by any desired coating method, such as roll coating, gravure coating, roll brush coating, spray coating, air knife coating, impregnation and curtain coating, either singly or in combination. The polyester film on which the aqueous coating composition has thus been applied is dried, and sent to such steps as stretching and heat setting. For example, a longitudinally stretched polyester film coated with the aqueous primer coating composition is led to a stenter where it is transversely stretched and heat set. During this time, the coated composition dries and undergoes crosslinking reaction to form a continuous film on the polyester base film. The heat required for the crosslinking reaction is usually supplied by the heat applied during stretching or heat setting, and its temperature is generally 180 to 250 C. The heating time depends upon the temperature, and may, for example, be about 8 seconds at 220 C, about 10 seconds at 200 C. The orientation and crystallization conditions for the polyester film, for example, the stretching or heat setting conditions, may be selected from those known The present invention has the great advantage that the primer layer can be applied by the in line coating method, and therefore can be provided in a much smaller thickness than in the prior art. The polyester film of this invention having the particular primer layer has high adhesion to a very broad range of paints such as an ink for cellophane, a magnetic paint, a gelatin composition, an electrophotographic toner composition and a chemical mat paint, and excellent solvent resistance to organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, toluene, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethanol, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran. cyclohexanone, and cyclohexane. The polyester film having the primer layer provided by this invention is particularly suitable as a base film for magnetic recording media. A magnetic recording layer may be formed on the primer layer of the film of this invention by techniques built up in the art. Generally, the magnetic layer is composed of an organic polymeric compound as a binder, a magnetic powder, and additives such as a lubricant, antistatic agent, polishing agent, or dispersant. Examples of the binder are thermoplastic resins such as vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer, polyurethane resins, nitrocellulose and saturated polyester resins, epoxy resins, thermosetting resins comprising thermoplastic resins and crosslinking agents such as polyisocyanate compounds, and polyfunctional acrylates crosslinkable e.g. by heat, actinic light and electron beams. Acicular fine particles such as gamma Fe₂O₃, Co gamma Fe₂O₃, CrO₂, Fe and barium ferrite may be used as the magnetic powder. Examples of the lubricant are silicone oils, carbon, graphite, fatty acids and fatty acid esters. Carbon black may be used as the antistatic agent. Examples of the polishing agent are Al₂O₃ and Cr₂O₃. Lecithin and surfactants may be used as the dispersant. The following examples illustrate the present invention further. All parts in these examples are by weight. The properties of the films were measured by the following methods. A paint for evaluation was coated on a sample polyester film having a primer layer, and dried at 80 C for 1 minute, thereafter cured at 60 C for 24 hours, and roll coated so that the average thickness of the coating became 2 micrometers. The coated film was abraded with an RCA abrasion tester under a head load of 50 g. The number of abrasion cycles until the coated surface was holed was determined and made a measure of adhesion. Nitrocellulose RS 1 2 , flakes containing 25 of isopropanol was dissolved in a thinner of a lacquer to form a 40 by weight solution. A ball mill was charged with 43.9 parts of the resulting solution and then with 32.5 parts of a polyester resin Desmophen 1700 , 2.60 parts of a magnetic powder of chromium dioxide, 1 part of a soybean oil fatty acid Lecion P , 0.5 part of a cationic surfactant Cation AB , and 0.8 part of squalane shark liver oil as a dispersant or a wetting agent. A mixed solution 282 parts composed of methyl ethyl ketone cyclohexane toluene weight ratio 3 4 3 was added. The mixture was fully milled to prepare a base paint 45 by weight . Fifty parts of the base paint was mixed with 48 parts of an adduct of trimethylolpropane and toluene disiocyanate Coronate L and 6.25 parts of butyl acetate to obtain a magnetic paint having a solids content of 42.75 by weight. One drop about 0.02 cc of tetrahydrofuran THF or cyclohexanone CHX was dropped onto the surface of the sample polyester film having a primer coating layer by means of a squirt. A gauze was placed on it and a weight 100 g was further placed on it. The gauze was moved at a speed of about 1000 mm min. After drying at room temperature, the sample treated with tetrahydrofuran or cyclohexanone and a non treated sample were photographed through an interference microscope at a magnification of 400. The photogaphs were compared, and the change of the surface of the primer layer was evaluated on the following scale. An aqeuous primer coating composition having a solids concentration of 4 by weight was prepared by diluting 78 parts as nonvolatile components of an aqueous dispersion of polyurethane having a carboxyllic acid amine salt group Melusi 545 , a trademark for aliphatic polyester polyurethane having a molecular weight of about 40,000 and containing 3 x 10 ⁴ gram equivalent g of functional groups , 10 parts of polyoxyethylene nonyl phenyl ether tradename NS 240 Ltd. where n is about 40 , 10 parts of a polyepoxy compound Melsi AD C 65 , and 2 parts of 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol with deionized water. Polyethylene terephthalate containing a filler having an inherent viscosity, measured in o chlorophenol at 25 C, of 0.65 was melt extruded onto a rotating cooled drum kept at 20 C to form an unstretched film having a thickness of 950 micrometers, and then stretched to 3.5 times in the machine direction. The same coating composition as prepared in the Preparation Example was coated on both surfaces of the monoaxially stretched film. The film was subsequently stretched to 3.9 times in the transverse direction at 105 C, and then heat treated at 210 C to form a biaxially oriented polyester film having a thickness of 75 micrometers having the primer layer formed on both surfaces. The average rate of coating was 50 mg as solids m². In each run, a coated polyester film was produced in the same way as in Example 1 except that diglycerol triglycidyl ether Example 2 or ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether Example 3 was used instead of the polyepoxy compound used in Example 1. In each run, a coated polyester film was produced in the same way as in Example 1 except that 2 methylimidazole Example 4 or 2 methyl 4 ethylimidazole Example 5 was used instead of the reaction promoting compound used in Example 1. A coated polyester film was produced in the same way as in Example 1 except that a polyurethane dispersion containing a carboxylic acid amine salt group Hydran HW 100 polyester polyurethane having a carboxylic acid amine salt group content of 5 x 10 ⁴ gramequivalent g and a molecular weight of about 15,000 was used instead of the coating composition used in Example 1. A coated polyester film was produced in the same way as in Example 1 except that an aqueous dispersion of polyurethane containing 2.5 x 10 ⁴ gram equivalent g of OSO 3 groups in the molecule and synthesized from an aliphatic polyester derived from adipic acid, sebacic acid, 1,5 pentanediol and neopentyl glycol and having an OH value of 53, hexamethylene diisocyanate, aminoethanol hemisulfate and potassium hydroxide was used instead of the coating composition used in Example 1. For comparison, a polyethylene terephthlate film having a thickness of 75 micrometers and having no primer layer was used for evaluating various properties. A coated polyester film was produced in the same way as in Example 1 except that the epoxy resin and the reaction promoting compound were not used and the aqueous polyurethane resin was used in an amount of 90 parts and the polyoxynonyl phenyl ether was used in an amount of 10 parts. The adhesions and solvent resistances of the polyester films obtained in Examples 1 to 7 and Comparative Examples 1 to 2 were measured, and the results are shown in Table 1. They were also tested for blocking force g 15 cm . The results are also shown in Table 1. The results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the primer layers of the films of this invention have excellent solvent resistance and adhesion. Polyethylene terephthalate containing 0.5 by weight of titanium oxide having an average particle diameter of 0.3 micrometer having an inherent viscosity, measured in o chlorophenol at 25 C, of 0.65 was meltextruded onto a rotating cooled drum kept at 20 C to obtain an unstretched film having a thickness of 950 micrometers. The film was then stretched to 3.5 times in the machine direction, and coated on both surfaces with the same coating composition as prepared in the Preparation Example by the kiss coating method. Subsequently, the film was stretched to 3.9 times in the transverse direction at 105 C, and heat treated at 210 C to form a polyester base film having the primer coated layer on both surfaces and also having a thickness of 75 µm and an Ra of 0.01 micrometer. The average rate of coating was 20 mg as solids m². A composition composed of the following ingredients was coated on both surfaces of the base film so that the thickness of the coating on each surface became 1.0 micrometer on drying. The coated film was dried and the surface was calendered. The film was then heated and cured, and punched out in a disc form. The surface of the magnetic layer was polished with a lapping tape having alumina with an average particle diameter of 2 micrometers as an abrasive agent to obtain a floppy disc. A floppy disc was produced in the same way as in Example 8 except that an aliphatic polyester polyurethane Neorez R 966 , molecular weight about 200,000, carboxylic acid amine salt group content 1.5 x 10 ⁴ gram equivalent g was used instead of the coating composition used in Example 8. For comparison, a floppy disc was produced in the same way as in Example 8 except that the primer coating composition was not coated. The floppy discs obtained in Examples 8 and 9 and Comparative Example 3 were tested for durability at an ambient temperature of 50 C using a 5.25 inch both surface type floppy disc device. The durability time of the floppy discs was expressed by the time which elapsed until the output level became 80 or less of the initial value when the floppy discs was continuously rotated under a head load on the same track. The results are shown in Table 2. It is seen from Table 2 that the floppy discs produced by using the primer coated films of the invention as bases have excellent durability and can withstand use for an extended period of time.
