# CONSTANT CURRENT SOURCES FOR FIELD CONTACT INPUTS

## Abstract
A circuit acting as a constant current source somprises a transistor Q1 having an emitter to base unction forward biased by a voltage of from 24 to 125 volts DC on a terminal 14 . A 5.6 volt Zener diode D1 is connected between the base and the voltage supply terminal 14 and a light emitting diode D1 is connected between the collector and a field con tact 6 . A substantially constant current supply is provided over the abovementioned voltage range.
