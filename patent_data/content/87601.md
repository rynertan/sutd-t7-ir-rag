# Integrated circuit mechanism for coupling multiple programmable logic arrays to a common bus.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit mechanism is provided for cou pling the separate sets 135, 136, 137 of output lines from a plurality of programmable logic arrays 24, 26, 28 to the same set of bus lines 143a 143n of a plural line signal transfer bus 36 . This coupling mechanism includes pre charge circuitry 144a 144n for precharging each of the bus lines 143a 143n during a first time interval B . This coupling mechanism also includes a separate strobe signal line S1, SA, SC for each programmable logic array 24, 26, 28 and circuitry 30, 37 for activating one of the strobe signal lines S1, SA, SC during a second time interval A for selecting a particular programmable logic array. This cou pling mechanism further includes a separate output buffer 32, 33, 34 for each programmable logic array 24, 26, 28 . Each such output buffer includes a plurality of output buffer stages e.g. 140a 140n for individually coupling the different ones of the programmable logic array output lines e.g. 135a 135n to their respective bus lines 143a 143n . The output buffer stages e.g. 140a 140n for each programmable logic array e.g. 24 are responsive to the strobe signal e.g. S1 for its programmable logic array e.g. 24 for discharging during the second time interval A those bus lines 143a 143n for which its programmable logic array output lines e.g. 135a 135n are at a particular binary value.
