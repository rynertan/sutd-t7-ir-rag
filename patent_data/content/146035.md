# Thermoplastic resin having excellent impact resistance and heat resistance.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin having excellent impact resistance and heat resistance obtainable by polymerizing 93 to 30 parts by weight of a monomer mixture comprising 20 to 90 by weight of at least one α alkyl aromatic vinyl monomer, 10 to 40 by weight of at least one vinyl cyanide monomer and 0 to 60 by weight of at least one vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith 100 by weight in total in the presence of 7 to 70 parts by weight in terms of solid of a rubber latex of a large particle size having a particle diameter of at least 0.2 µm ob tained by adding 0.1 to 5 parts by weight in terms of solid of an acid group containing copolymer B latex obtained from 3 to 30 by weight of an acid group containing monomer, 97 to 35 by weight of at least one alkyl acrylate having 1 to 12 car bon atoms in the alkyl group, and 0 to 48 by weight of at least one vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith 100 by weight in total to 100 parts by weight in terms of solid of a rubber A latex of a small particle size having a pH of 7 or higher ob tained from 100 to 50 by weight of 1,3 butadiene and 0 to 50 by weight of a monomer having CH₂ C group and copolymerizable therewith 100 by weight in total .
