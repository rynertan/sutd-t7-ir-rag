## Description
This invention relates to an ignition distributor for internal combustion engine, and more particularly to an ignition distributor for internal combustion engine with reduced generation of radio noises. Generally, internal combustion engines having an electric ignition system generate radio noise in a wide frequency range, which disturb radio broadcasting service, television broadcasting service and other kinds of radio communication systems. Particularly, the radio noise from the internal combustion engines of vehicles gives a disturbance to electronic appliances now provided on the vehicles for versatile applications and gives an adverse effect on the vehicle running. One of the noise generation sources is an electric discharge at the ignition distributor for the internal combustion engine. Attempts have been so far made to suppress the noise generation at the ignition distributor, for example JP61 28759 laid open application no. 59 149525 Hitachi Ltd provides a resistor of a few kΩ at the intermediate part of a rotor electrode in the ignition distributor to suppress generation of radio noise with high frequency. However, a discharge voltage is high between the rotor electrode and the stationary electrode and an energy loss during the electric discharge is high in such an attempt, resulting in less effect on suppression of radio noise generation. Another attempt is to provide a resistor or a dielectric as projected at the tip end of the metallic rotor electrode, where a precursor electric discharge takes place between the resistor or the dielectric and the stationary electrode, and the main electric discharge then takes place therebetween. That is, the electric discharge energy can be reduced, but no effect on oscillation suppression of the main electric discharge current can be obtained, and a less effect on reduction in the radio noise generation can be attained. These prior arts are disclosed in Japanese patent application numbers laid open 53 21336, 53 54630, 53 90534, 56 75969, 57 140563, 55 91768 and 57 113967. US A 4165452 discloses a rotor blade comprising composite material. The composite material has a conductive metal phase interspersing a dielectric phase. The dielectric phase comprises approximately 10 of the composite material. Zirconium oxide is discussed as an example dielectric phase. The electrically conductive metals disclosed are copper, nickel, silver, brass, aluminium and their high melting alloys. US A 4166201 discloses a similar rotor blade and the same electrically conductive metals. US A 4217470 discloses the use of a composite electrode which may include zirconium oxide and other inorganic compounds. US A 4224068 discloses a composite electrode comprising silica and copper oxide. FR2435612 relates to control of the specific resistance of a rotor electrode. CH A 344108 discloses the use of nickel and zinc oxides as electroconductive inorganic compounds. An object of the present invention is to provide an ignition distributor for an internal combustion engine with less electric discharge energy and reduced radio noise generation. Therefore the present invention provides an ignition distributor for an internal combustion engine which comprises a rotor electrode capable of rotary motion and a plurality of stationary electrodes arranged in a circle around the rotor electrode, with an electric discharge clearance therebetween the rotor electrode being made of a sintered mixture which has a specific resistance of 10 to 10⁶ Ωcm at room temperature and which comprises zirconium oxide and as a main component an electroconductive inorganic material, wherein said electroconductive inorganic material is at least one compound selected from nitrides, borides, carbides and silicides of transition elements of groups IIIa, IVa, Va and VIa of the periodic table or a metal oxide semiconductor. The sintered mixture may contain a small amount of a sintering aid to improve the sintering ability. The electroconductive inorganic compound, may comprise at least one of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, etc., or metal oxide semi conductors, more specifically. TiO₂, Nb₂O₃, V₂O₅, MoO₂, CdO, ZnO, SnO₂, Fe₃O₄, Ta₂O₅, CoO, Cu₂O, Cr₂O₃, SnO, MnO, NiO, WO₃, etc. or double oxides having an improved electroconductivity, for example, BaTiO₃, SrTiO₃, etc. can also be used. Such sintered mixture contains high resistance regions comprising zirconium oxide and conductive regions in mixture. Effects of using such a sintered mixture as a rotor electrode will be explained as follows. The accumulated electric charges on the high resistance regions at the surface increase the local electric field and lowers the discharge voltage, resulting in reduced electric discharge energy. Furthermore, the high frequency current is controlled by the relatively high resistance effect of rotor electrode to suppress the radio noise generation. To attain such effects, it is desirable that the specific resistance of sintered mixture is 10 to 10⁶ Ωcm. With too low a specific resistance, no better resistance effect can be obtained, whereas with too high a specific resistance the rotor electrode turns electrically insulating, and can no more play a role of electrode. When zinc oxide ZnO , cobalt oxide CoO , and nickel oxide NiO is used in the rotor electrode, it is preferable that the sintered mixture contains 40 95 by volume of these oxides in total and 60 5 by volume of zirconium oxide ZrO₂ . It is particularly preferable that a ratio of ZnO to ZrO₂ by volume is 7 3 and the sintered mixture further contains a specific resistance controlling agent. The specific resistance controlling agent can be exemplified by antimony oxide Sb₂O₃ , aluminum oxide Al₂O₃ , titanium oxide TiO₂ and magnesium oxide MgO . Silicon oxide SiO₂ , or ZnAl₂O₄, Co Al₂O₄, NiAl₂O₄, Zn₂SiO₄, Co₂SiO₄, Ni₂SiO₄, etc. can be used as an insulating oxide together with ZrO₂. The sintered mixture for use in the present invention can be prepared by mixing raw material powders, molding the mixture, and sintering the molded mixture by means of hot press or pressureless sintering. When the sintered mixture is used as a rotor electrode, it can be easily mass produced at low cost, because there is no necessity for combining with other parts of different material. The sintered mixture for use in the present invention contains ZrO₂ as a component, and thus has a high mechanical strength. Furthermore, it contains the inorganic compound as described above as the electro conductive component, and thus has a good chemical stability and a long durability. Furthermore, ZrO₂ is less reactive to other oxides during the sintering than Al₂O₃, and thus the desired sintered mixture can be obtained stably. In the drawings Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram for measuring a noise current generated in an ignition distributor for an internal combustion engine. Fig. 1 shows a vertical cross sectional view of an ignition distributor for an internal combustion engine according to one embodiment of the present invention. Inside a cap It has been a problem that radio noise with high frequency is generated by the electric discharge between the stationary electrode Powder of zirconium oxide ZrO₂ and powder of aluminum oxide Al₂O₃ were mixed together in various mixing ratios, and further MgO and Y₂O₃ as sintering aids and other transition element compounds were added thereto. The resulting powdery mixture was molded under a pressure of 1,000 kg cm², and sintered in an argon gas under one atmosphere at a temperature of 1,580 C for one hour. Rotor electrodes were prepared from the resulting sintered mixtures and mounted on ignition distributors for internal combustion engines. The electric noise current generated in the ignition distributors provided with the thus prepared rotor electrodes was measured in the following manner. The individual terminals of aluminum stationary electrodes were earthed through a resistor, and an electric discharge current was passed to the earth through the resistor. Both ends of the resistor were connected to the input terminals of a noise meter and the noise components generated by the electric discharge were measured by the noise meter. The measuring circuit is shown in Fig. 2. A battery Compositions and specific resistance of sintered mixtures used and results of measurement of electric noise current, based on the conventional brass rotor electrode as a reference, are shown in Table 1. As is evident from the results, a high noise suppressing effect can be obtained, when the specific resistance of the sintered mixtures is 10 to 10⁶ Ωcm. When copper and stainless steel stationary electrodes were used, the similar results could be obtained. When sintered mixtures prepared by hot pressing were used as rotor electrodes, the similar results could be obtained. When the sintered mixtures were mounted as rotor electrodes in ignition distributors in the present example, no breakage was observed at all. It is seem that the sintered mixtures had a strength high enough to withstand the load applied during the fabrication. Sintered mixtures of Al₂O₃, ZrO₂ and various semi conductor oxides were prepared in the similar manner as in Example 1 and ignition distributors for internal combustion engines were assembled, using the sintered mixtures as rotor electrodes. Then, the electric noise current was measured in the similar manner as in Example 1. Compositions and specific resistance of sintered mixtures and results of measurement of electric noise current, based on the conventional brass rotor electrode as a reference, are shown in Table 2. As is evident from the results, a high noise suppressing effect can be obtained when the specific resistance of sintered mixtures is 10 to 10⁶ Ωcm. Antimony oxide Sb₂O₃ was added to zinc oxide ZnO powder in a ratio of the former to the latter of 4 by volume, and further zirconium oxide ZrO₂ was added thereto in various mixing ratios. The resulting powdery mixtures were molded under a pressure of 1,000 kg cm² and then sintered in the air at a temperature of 1,300 C for 3 hours. Rotor electrodes were prepared from the resulting sintered mixtures and mounted on ignition distributors for internal combustion engines, as shown in Fig. 1. Electric noise current generated from the ignition distributors was measured in the similar manner as in Example 1. Compositions and specific resistances of sintered mixtures, and results of measurement of electric noise current based on the conventional brass rotor electrode as the reference are shown in Table 3. As is evident from the results, the resistance is too high when the sintered mixture contains less than 40 by volume of ZnO, and thus the sintered mixture cannot be used as a rotor electrode. As is also evident from the results, a high noise suppressing effect of more than 10 dB can be obtained when the sintered mixture contains 50 to 95 by volume of ZnO. When copper or stainless steel stationary electrodes were used, similar noise suppressing effect could be obtained. Composition A of cobalt oxide CoO powder containing 0.1 by mole of lithium carbonate Li₂CO₃ on the basis of cobalt oxide and composition B of nickel oxide NiO powder containing 7 by mole of lithium carbonate Li₂CO₃ on the basis of nickel oxide were prepared. These mixtures were each mixed with ZrO₂ in various mixing ratios, and the resulting mixtures were molded and sintered at a temperature of 1,350 C for 3 hours. Rotor electrodes were prepared from the sintered mixtures, and noise electric current was measured in the similar manner as in Example 1. Compositions and specific resistance of sintered mixtures and results of measurement of electric noise current are shown in Table 4. When the sintering mixture contains less than 40 by volume of composition A or B, the resistance is so high that it cannot be used as a rotor electrode. It has been found by X ray diffraction that lithium carbonate is decomposed during the sintering and diffused into cobalt oxide or nickel oxide, and that the compositions A and B consist essentially of CoO and NiO, respectively. As is evident from the results, a high noise suppressing effect of more than 10 dB can be obtained, when the sintered mixture contains 40 to 95 by volume of composition A or B. When copper and stainless steel staionary electrodes were used, similar results could be obtained. Still further sintered mixture compositions were investigated according to Example 3. A sintered mixture of 70 vol. ZnO 25 vol. ZrO₂ 5 vol. MgO sample No. 33 had an electric noise current of 15 dB, when prepared into a rotor electrode, and similarly a sintered mixture of 70 vol. ZnO 10 vol. NiO 20 vol ZrO₂ sample No. 34 had an electric noise current of 18 dB when prepared into a rotor electrode. On the basis of the conventional brass rotor electrode as a reference. Sintered mixtures having compositions shown in Table 5 were prepared by molding under a pressure of 1,000 kg cm² and sintered in the air at 1,300 C for 3 hours, and prepared into rotor electrodes. The specific resistance at 20 C and electric noise current thereof are shown in Table 5.
