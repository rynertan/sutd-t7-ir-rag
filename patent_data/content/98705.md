# Phase lock loop circuit.

## Abstract
A phase lock loop circuit has a voltage controlled oscillator 7 controlled in dependence upon a phase error signal and a sweep signal a superimposed on the phase error signal there by to sweep the voltage controlled oscillator 7 . The circuit has means 11 operable to suspend such sweeping of the voltage controlled oscillator 7 when phase lock is achieved and to maintain the superimposition, on the phase error signal, of the level of the sweep signal a immediately before phase lock is achieved.
