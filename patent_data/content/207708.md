## Description
The present invention relates to improvements in the packaging of liquids, in particular pressurised liquids and more particularly to containers for carbonated beverages. The bag in box techniques for packaging have been widely used for many years, particularly with regard to the packaging of still table wines. The package comprises an outer box, usually made of cardboard and fitted with a handle, and a substantially impermeable bag disposed within the box, the bag being filled with wine and fitted with a tap which projects through a suitable aperture in the outer box so that wine may be withdrawn from the container as and when required. The impermeable bag is usually of a multi layer construction, for example an inner layer of polyethylene or an ethylene vinyl acetate EVA copolymer and an outer layer comprising a triple laminate of polyethylene metallised polyester EVA or nylon aluminium polyolefin. The main advantage of a container of this type, in comparison to conventional bottles or the like, is that as wine is withdrawn the flexible impermeable bag collapses in compensation and no air enters the bag. This prevents the oxidation of the wine, which of course renders it undrinkable, and therefore the wine remains palatable for some time after the container has been opened. Other advantages of such containers are that they are readily stackable and transportable. It has long been recognised that it would be advantageous if bag in box packaging could be used for carbonated beverages such as beer, lemonade and sparkling wine. The main problem which has to be overcome is that,as the carbonated beverage is withdrawn from the container, the carbonated beverage remaining in the container loses carbon dioxide into the headspace created. As the headspace becomes larger, the beverage loses more and more carbon dioxide and thus very quickly becomes flat. Furthermore, the impermeable bags in which the carbonated beverage is contained will also tend to bulge and this in turn tends to make the whole container unstable. We have now developed a container for the packaging of pressurised liquids which is based, essentially, upon the bag in box principle. Accordingly, the present invention provides a container for a pressurised liquid which comprises an outer box and an inner flexible impermeable bag for containing a liquid and having a tap incorporated therein so that liquid may be withdrawn from the container, the inner flexible bag being at least partially surrounded by a sleeve of a film of elastomeric material having the following properties The sleeve material used in the present invention is an elastomeric material which is capable of withstanding such a tensile elongation as defined by BS 903, Methods Of Testing Vulcanised Rubber, Part A2 1971 that, when it is employed as a sleeve around a beverage filled inner impermeable bag, it is capable of applying sufficient stress to collapse the bag so as to expel at least 50 of the bag contents, and preferably at least 75 of the contents, and even more preferably at least 90 of the contents. Taking a spherical shape as being the shape requiring the lowest level of tensile elongation, it has been calculated that the sleeve material would be required to withstand a tensile elongation of at least 25 to expel at least 50 of the bag contents, a tensile elongation of at least about 60 to expel at least 75 of the bag contents, and a tensile elongation of at least about 120 to expel at least 90 of the bag contents. Many elastomeric materials possess breaking elongations of at least 120 . However, it is important that the material should also satisfy the requirements of tensile modulus, tension set and stress relaxation as defined above. Essential characteristics of the elastomeric sleeve are that it should be capable of minimising decarbonation of the liquid over a period of time prior to and during dispensing of the liquid from the container, normally defined by the shelf life of the product, and it should assist the expulsion of the liquid from the impermeable bag to a high degree. In order to achieve these characteristics, the sleeve must be capable of applying a stress on the impermeable bag which is greater than that exerted by the carbon dioxide. It is obvious that this may be achieved with an elastomeric film which possesses a low tensile modulus by using such a film thickness that the required tensile stiffness is obtained. However, this may necessitate the use of what would appear to be an excessively thick sleeve. It is a feature of the present invention that by the judicious choice of elastomeric material, a film thickness may be selected which both satisfies the tensile stiffness requirements for the sleeve and is acceptable from the thickness weight cost point of view. Elastomers for use in the sleeve may be non crosslinked or crosslinked. It is possible that some vulcanized natural and synthetic rubbers, including thermoplastic rubbers, may be suitable for use as the elastomer but for thin sleeves it is found that preferred and advantageous elastomers are thermoplastic polyurethanes which may be non crosslinked or crosslinked. It has been found that for a flexible bag containing 5 litres of beverage which is carbonated to a level of 1.3 volumes of carbon dioxide per volume of liquid, a sleeve which performs satisfactorily with respect to retention of carbonation and bag collapse may be fabricated from a thermoplastic polyurethane film in the range of from 0.15 to 0.50 mm thickness, whereas an equivalent sleeve manufactured from an elastomer with a lower modulus, e g a vulcanized nitrile rubber, requires a film thickness significantly greater than 0.50 mm, possibly as thick as 4.0 mm. The various other properties of the film were determined as follows The stress relaxation characteristics of the elastomeric films were determined by the following test method Dumb bell test pieces conforming to BS 903, Part A2 1971 Type 2, were cut from the film material. A 25 mm reference length was marked on the narrow portion of the test piece and the thickness and width of the test piece were measured at 23 2 C in accordance with BS 903, Part A2 1971. The test piece was placed in the grips of a suitable tensile testing machine e g Instron model 1026 and extended to the required strain at a grip separation rate of 500 50 mm minute. The test strain was calculated by the formula The modulus at a given tensile elongation is as defined and determined by BS 903, Part A2 1971, Determination of Tensile Stress Strain. The modulus at 50 tensile elongation, determined at 20 2 C, should lie between 0.5 and 20 MPa, preferably between 2.5 and 15 MPa and more preferably between 5 and 10 MPa. Furthermore, the modulus at 100 tensile elongation, determined at 20 2 C, should lie between 1 and 25 MPa, preferably between 2 and 20 MPa and more preferably between 4 and 16 MPa. Still further, the modulus at 200 tensile elongation determined at 20 2 C, should lie between 1.5 and 40 MPa, preferably between 7.5 and 25 MPa. Tension set was determined using the following test procedure. Dumb bell test pieces in accordance with Type 1 as described in BS 903, Part A2 1971 were cut from the elastomer film. A reference length was marked on the test piece using a suitable method, the reference length being between 25 mm and 50 mm. The unstrained reference length was measured to the nearest 0.1 mm at 23 2 C. The test piece was placed in the grips of a tensile testing machine e g Instron 1026 and the test piece was extended to the required strain at a grip separation rate of 200 20 mm minute. The test strain was calculated by the formula The inner flexible impermeable bag must be capable of preventing the ingress of oxygen into the bag and of preventing the escape of carbon dioxide therefrom. The impermeable bag is thus generally of a multi layer construction, for example having an inner layer of an ethylene vinyl acetate EVA copolymer and an outer layer comprising a triple laminate of polyethylene metallised polyester EVA or nylon aluminium polyolefin. Bags known for use in bag in box containers for non pressurised beverages such as wine may be employed in the present invention, provided of course that their strength is sufficient to withstand the pressure of the pressurised liquid. The shape of the elastomeric sleeve may be, for example, substantially spherical, substantially tubular or in between these shapes. It may be substantially closed to substantially completely enclose the inner bag or it may be open at one or more positions, e g at one or both ends of a substantially tubular shape. For a tubular sleeve and a 4.5 litre bag, an example of suitable dimensions of the rectangular shape of the sleeve when flattened is about 12.5 cm 25 cm. When the film of elastomeric material is in the form of an open ended sleeve, it may be desirable for the outer box to include a platform or strengthened portion at each end thereof in order to prevent the bag from bulging from each end of the sleeve. When the film of elastomeric material is in the form of a sleeve which is closed at one or both ends, it may be possible to dispense with one or both of the aforementioned platforms or strengthened portions, providing that the outer box is sufficiently strong to support the weight of the bag filled with pressurised liquid. The inner bag is provided with a tap for the withdrawal of liquid therefrom and this tap will project through the sleeve of elastomeric film. The conventional way in which bag in box containers have been filled with liquids such as wine is by filling the inner bag with the required quantity of liquid, if necessary under pressure, through a port provided therein and thereafter inserting a tap of the appropriate dimensions into the port. This method might be suitable for filling bag in box containers with pressurised liquids if the liquid to be admitted to the bag can be chilled to a temperature at which it is still liquid but at which the escape of carbon dioxide from it is prevented or reduced to a very low level. For example, in the case of beer at a temperature of 0 C almost no carbon dioxide escapes from the liquid. Alternatively to filling the bag through the tap port, the liquid may be admitted, if necessary under pressure, through a separate aperture in the bag, which aperture is sealed against escape of the contents of the bag after filling, for example by means of a one way valve. A one way valve also may be employed when filling the bag through the tap port, the valve being re opened by insertion of the tap into the port. The material of the inner bag usually is substantially inextensible and accordingly the overall dimensions of the bag in the flattened unfilled state should be significantly greater than the overall dimensions of the unstretched elastomeric sleeve. The sleeve may be applied to the inner bag in various ways. For example, the sleeve may be stretched mechanically and placed around the filled inner bag, or the sleeve may be stretched, frozen, placed around the filled inner bag and then allowed to warm up to restore its elastic properties. Alternatively a sheet of the elastomeric material may be folded to envelop the inner bag, if desired whilst the material is in a stretched state, and then joined along its edges to form the sleeve. A preferred method of application, however, is to place a sleeve or folded sheet of the elastomeric material around an inner bag which has been folded to reduce its shape dimensions, edge seal the folded sheet if employed , and thereafter fill the inner bag with the desired liquid, e g under pressure, so that the elastomeric material becomes stretched. This method may be adapted for continuous filling and assembly by the steps of providing a web of inner bags which are joined one to another along opposing edges thereof, folding the bags of the web to reduce their shape dimensions, assembling the folded web between two lengths of elastomeric film or between the two flaps of a longitudinally doubled elastomeric film, joining together the longitudinally adjacent film edges and, if desired, transversely joining together the opposing film surfaces between the bags, filling each bag with a predetermined quantity of the liquid, and thereafter separating the filled bag sleeve assemblies. The joining or sealing of the sleeve or film suitably may be achieved by welding e g heat or ultrasonic welding or by means of an adhesive. In the preferred method of producing a filled bag sleeve assembly continuous or not , as the bag is filled with the liquid, the contained volume of the bag increases and the outer surface of the bag presses and moves against the inner surface of the sleeve and causes the sleeve to stretch and expand. Preferably the friction between the outer surface of the bag and the inner surface of the sleeve should be minimised in order to minimise or avoid creasing of the bag and undesired irregular stretching of the sleeve. The friction may be minimised by means of a judiciously chosen folding pattern of the bag prior to filling, especially a folding pattern comprising both longitudinal and transverse folds multiplanar folding , and or by employment of friction reducing means such as a low friction interlayer between the bag and the sleeve, a low friction coating of, for example, talc or silicone, on the outer surface of the bag and or the inner surface of the sleeve, and or by incorporation of a friction reducing ingredient such as an anti block agent or a lubricant in the elastomeric material of the sleeve. The physical properties of the elastomeric material may be varied by known techniques, for example by uni or multi axial orientation to produce anisotropy , by heat treatment to modify the crystalline structure and adjust the tension set , by incorporation of ingredients such as plasticizers and particulate e g fibrous reinforcing agents, by perforating the film, and or by varying the film thickness. It may be desirable for the material to have different physical properties at different portions of the sleeve, for instance in order to inhibit non uniform circumferential expansion of the sleeve which might tend to result from friction contact with the inner bag or from constraints in or by the container during filling of the bag, and or in order to obtain a particular shape of the filled bag sleeve assembly. These different physical properties may be achieved by use of the above mentioned techniques. If desired, the sleeve may comprise two or more different elastomer films to achieve the required expanded product. The film of elastomeric material may be manufactured by any of the methods which are well known in the art, for example by blown film extrusion, flat film extrusion, casting, calendering, injection blow moulding or extrusion blow moulding. In a commercial form of the container, the tap may be confined within the outer box and the box may have a removable non replaceable portion in the vicinity of the tap, for example a portion defined by perforations, so that this portion can be removed and the tap can be pulled through the resulting hole in the box for the first dispensing of the liquid. This ensures that the container is tamper proof and spill proof prior to the first dispensing of the liquid. The outer box generally will be provided with the appropriate printing descriptive of the contents thereof and usually will also have a carrying handle. It will be understood that the containers of the present invention may be filled with any liquids although their most important application is as containers for carbonated beverages such as beer including lager , sparkling wine, cider, perry, lemonade and other carbonated soft drinks.
