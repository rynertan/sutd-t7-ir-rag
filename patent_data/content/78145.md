# Resolution of racemic 5 phenyl 2 pentanol.

## Abstract
Racemic 5 phenyl 2 pentanol is resolved via its hemiph thalate ester, followed by diastereomer salt formation with brucine, separation of the brucine salt of S 5 phenyl 2 pentylhemi phthalate and recovery of the S alcohol there from. The S 5 phenyl 2 pentanol is a valuable intermediate for organic synthesis. The separated brucine salt of S 5 phenyl 2 pentylhemiphthalate is a novel and useful intermediate.
