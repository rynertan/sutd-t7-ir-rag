Other compounds within the scope of Formula I are those disclosed in our U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. 618,731 723,506 618,730 and 723,997. Copies of these specifications are available for inspection on the file of the present Application. Detailed Description of the Invention Synthesis The compounds of Formula t where J is J 1 can be prepared by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 1, 2 and 3. Reaction conditions are given by way of illustration only. As shown in Equation 1 below, the compounds ofFormula I where J is J 1 can be prepared by treating sulfonamides of Formula II with the methyl ester of a pyrimidine or triazinecarbamic acid of Formula III in the presence of an equimolar quantity of trimethylaluminum.Equation 1EMI13.1 wherein A. R, R1, Q and n are as previously defined. The reaction of Equation 1 is best carried out at temperatures between 230 to 830C in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or l,2 dichloroethane for 12 to 96 hours under an inert atmosphere. The product can be isolated by the addition of an aqueous acetic acid solution followed by extraction of the product into methylene chloride or direct filtration of a product of low solubility. The product can ordinarily be purified by trituration with solvents such as n butyl chloride, ethyl acetate or diethyl ether or by chromatography procedures. The methyl carbamates, III, can be conveniently prepared by treatment of the corresponding heterocyclic amines ofFormula VI with dimethyl carbonate or methyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or pyridine. Further details of this reaction and the preparation of the carbamates of Formula III can be found in EP A No. 83,975 published July 20, 1983 . Alternatively. compounds of Formula I where J is J 1 can be prepared by the reaction of sulfonamides ofFormula II with the phenyl ester of the appropriate carbamic acid, IV, in the presence of an equimolar quantity of a tertiary amine base such as 11.8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU .Equation 2EMI14.1 wherein A and R are as previously defined. The reaction of Equation 2 is best carried out at 20 to 300C in an inert solvent such as dioxane or acetonitrile. Aqueous acid work up affords the desired products. according to the teachings of EP ANo. 70,804 published January 2S, 1983 and SouthAfrican Patent Applications 825,042 and 830,441. The phenyl carbanates, IV. can be prepared by treating the corresponding heterocyclic amines of Formula VI with diphenyl carbonate or phenyl chloroformate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or pyridine. Also, many compounds of Formula I where J is J 1 can be prepared by reacting an appropriate sulfonyl isocyanate, V with the appropriately substituted aminoheterocycle. VI, as shown in Equation 3 below. Equation 3EMI15.1 wherein R, R1, A and n are as previously defined and O is Q 1 to Q 5, Q 10 to Q 17, Q 23 to Q 28, and Q 31 to Q 34. The reaction is best performed in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or toluene at 230 to 100 C for 1 to 24 hours. In cases where the products are insoluble in the reaction solvent, they may be isolated by simple filtration. When the products are soluble, they may be isolated by evaporation of the solvent and trituration of the residue with an appropriate solvent such as l chlorobutane, diethyl ether, methanol or ethyl acetate and filtration. The products may be further purified by column chromatography procedures. Sulfonyl isocyanates of Formula V above may be prepared, although often times in low yields, from corresponding sulfonamides of Formula II by methods analogous to those described in U.S. Patent 4,238,621 and EP A No. 83,975 published July 20, 1983 . By a preferred method, sulfonamides are reacted with phosgene, in the presence of n butyl isocyanate and a tertiary amine catalyst, at reflux in an inert solvent such as xylenes. A preferred catalyst is 1,4 diaza bicyclo 2.2.2 octane DABCO . Alternatively, isocyanates, V, may be prepard by 1 reacting sulfonamides,II, with n butyl isocyanate and a base such as potassium carbonate at reflux in an inert solvent such as 2 butanone to form a n butyl sulfonylurea and 2 reacting this compound with phosgene and DABCO catalyst at reflux in rylenes solvent. Many sulfonamides of Formula II can be prepared by the sequence af reactions shown below in Equation 4. Equation 4EMI16.1 wherein R1 and n are as previously defined and Q is Q 1 to Q 34 and Q 45 to Q 54. The reactions of Equation 4 a,b canbe run by methods analogous to those described in EP A Nos. 83,975 published July 20, 1983 and 85,476 published August 10. 1983 . In Reaction 4 a the methods require reacting amines of Formula VII with sodium nitrite in concentrated hydrochloric acid and acetic acid to form diazonium salts Following addition and reaction of the diazonius salt suspensions with suspensions containing excess sulfur dioxide and copper I chloride or copper 11 chloride catalyst in acetic acid sol veat. the sulfonyl chlorides, VIII, are isolated by addition of water, filtration if VIII is a solid, or extraction with methylene chloride if VIII is an oil. Generally, the sulfonyl chlorides, VIII, are pure enough to carry on to the next step without further purification. In Reaction 4 b , sulfonamides, IIa, are prepared by reacting sulfonyl chlorides, VIII, with excess ammonia or aqueous ammonium hydroxide in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Sulfonamides.IIa, are isolated by filtration and washing with water to remove the by product ammonium chloride, and concentrating the organic solution. The sulfonamides may be further purified by recrystallization or chromatography procedures. Many sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII may also be prepared via oxidative chlorination of the appropriate thioethers of Formula A, as illustrated inEquation 4a.Equation 4aEMI17.1 wherein R1 and Q do not contain a thioether or alkenyl group R1 is C2 C3 alkyl or benzyl and 9 is 9 1 to Q 34. The reaction of Equation 4a may be carried out by contacting a suspension of the thioether A in a solvent such as acetic acid or propionic acid in the presence of at least 2.5 equivalents of water with at least 3.0 equivalents of chlorine at about 10 to 300C for 0.25 to 5 hours. The reaction is poured into ice water and the product is isolated by filtration or extraction with a solvent such as methylene chloride.The extract is optionally washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate until neutral or slightly basic, then dried, and the solvent is evaporated to yield a product generally pure enough to be carried directly to the next step. Thioethers, A, may be prepared by analogy with methods described hereinafter in EquationIla, or simple modifications thereof, from appropriate corresponding thioethers containing ortho functional groups, J, by those skilled in the art. Certain sulfonamides of Formula II are preferably prepared from appropriately substituted o methoxy carbonyl alanebenzenesulfonamides of Formula IX, as shown below in Equation 5. Equation 5EMI18.1 EMI19.1 wherein R1 is as previously defined R8 is CH3, C2H5, CF2H, CH2CH CH2 or CH2CN and M is C1, Br or I and n is 1.Reaction 5 a The conversion of carboxylic esters to hydrazides is well known in the literature. In a typical procedure, a carboxylic ester of Formula IX is reacted with an excess of hydrazine monohydrate preferably 10 to 30 mole excess in an inert solvent such as methanol or ethanol at reflux for one to 24 hours. The hydrazides, X, are isolated by filtration or by concentration to remove the solvent and triturating the hydrazide residue, X, with water. The compounds are generally sufficiently pure to be carried on directly to step 5 b , but may be purified further by recrystallization procedures.Reaction 5 b The conversion of hydrazides to 2 mercaptooxadiazoles is also well known in the literature, e.g.. R. W. Young and K. H. Wood, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 77, 400 1955 . In a typical procedure, hydrazides,X, are heated at reflux with equimolar amounts of potassium hydroxide and an excess of carbon disulfide in methanol or ethanol solvent until the evolution of hydrogen sulfide has nearly stopped. By these conditions, however, thiadiazole XI is obtained from hydrazide X, based on mass spectrum analysis. Thiadiazoles, XI, are isolated by concentration of the solvent. addition of water to the residue, filtration of the aqueous suspension to remove insoluble impurities, acidification of the aqueous filtrate with hydrochloric acid and filtration.Compounds, XI, are generally pure enough to carry on to step 5 c , but nay be further purified by recrystallization procedures Reaction 5 c Thiadiazoles, XI, are alkylated by reaction with an equimolar amount of base such as potassium hydroxide and excess alkylating agent, XII, at reflux in an inert solvent such as methanol or ethanol for 0.5 to 24 hours. Sulfonamides, IIb, are isolated by concentration of the solvent. addition of water to the residue and filtration. For the case where R8 CF2H, the reaction is preferably run in N,N dimethylform amide DHF solvent at 60 90 C with excess potassium carbonate as base. Following addition of water, sulfonamides, IIb. are isolated by filtration they nay be purified by recrystallization procedures.Esters of the general Formula IX. where a is 1. are known see U.S. 4,348,219 issued September 7, 1982 . Sulfonamides of Formula II containing an o nethanepyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl or triazinyl group Q is Q 45 to Q 54 nay be prepared by the sequence of reactions shown below in Equation 6. Equation 6EMI21.1 wherein R1 is as originally defined, except R1 may not be Br and Q is 9 45 to Q 54. The compounds of Formula IIc are prepared by analogy with the teachings of EP A No. 85,476 published August 10, 1983 .Reactions 6 a.b An N t butyl sulfonamide of Formula XIII is dissolved in an ethereal solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, and two equivalents of n butyllithium in hexane are added at about 700C. After 1 5 hours at about 700C, the compound of Formula XIV is formed. This is not isolated, but one equivalent of a copper I iodide salt is added at about 70 , followed by 1 1.5 equivalents of an appropriately substituted heteroaromatic iodide of Formula XV. The reaction mixture is heated at OQ to 700C for 1 3 days, concentrated and poured onto aqueous ammonia. Compounds of Formula XVI are isolated by filtration if solids or by extraction with methylene chloride and concentration if oils.The compounds, XVI, may be further purified by recrystalLibation or chromatography procedures. The compounds of Formula XV above may be prepared according to methods known in the art, such as those reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Com pounds0, a series published by Interscience Publ., NewYork and London, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The iodopyridines are described in Vol. 14 of the above series, pp. 407 488.Iodopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown and S. F. arson in Vol. 16 of the above series. The preparation of iodopyrazines is taught by A. Hirshberg and P. E. Spoerri, J. Orq. Chem., 26, 1907 1981 and iodopyrid azimes are described by D. L. Aldons and R N. Castle in Vol. 28 of the Interscience series, pp. 240 241. The iodo 1,3,5 triazines are described by E. M. Smolin and L. Rapoport, in Vol. 13 of the above series, and a method for preparing iodo 1.2,4 triazines is taught byA. Rykowski and H. C. vaa der Plays. in J. Org. Chem., 45, 881 1980 .

Quaternary anine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of FormulaI or I e.g., alkali or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I or I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I orI with a suitable acid, e.g.. P toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspen sions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like.Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s .More speci fically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table XI Weight Percent Active Inqredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al,, Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured. may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Xarsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950.Solubility under 0.18 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 00C. cCutcheon s Detergents and EmulsifiersAnnual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., NewYork, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, wAgglomeration , Chemical Enqineerinq, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp. 8 57ff.

Some of the compounds have utility for selective weed control in crops such as wheat. Alternatively, the subject compounds are useful to modify plant growth. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application. amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.05 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for selective weed control or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow.
