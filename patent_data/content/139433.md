# Medical electrode device.

## Abstract
A medical electrode device comprises a flexible bag like member 15a which is formed on the side of the device 21 in direct contact with a living body and to and from which is charged and discharged a heat medium, and a flexible electrode 14 secured to the bag like member, wherein an inner surface of the flexible bag like member is at least partially joined to the other opposing inner surface of the bag like member to each other so as to form a partitioned flow channel 20 for the heat medium in the inside of the bag like member. The medical electrode device, when applied to the surface of a living body with a small radius of curvature, can be in an intimate contact with the living body without disturbing the distribution of the electric field, can attain a satisfactory cooling effect due to the use of a direct cooling system and the uniform flow distribution of water through the partitioned flow channel, as well as can perform efficient warming for the aimed lesion in the living body.
