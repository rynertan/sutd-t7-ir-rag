# Foam generator.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a foam generator conventionally consisting of a hollow stator 1 with a coaxial internal rotor 2 together forming an annular mixing chamber. Both stator and rotor being provided with alternate rings of polygonal pins 4, 3 reaching within the mixing chamber, each pin having at least two ribs 11 creating a vortex trail during generation. The rate of occupancy of the pins 4,3 is such that within a cross sectional range for the mixing chamber between 40 90 cmÂ², the quotient total vortex line length volume of mixing chamber amounts at least to 1,5 and preferably to between 2,4 and 3,0.
