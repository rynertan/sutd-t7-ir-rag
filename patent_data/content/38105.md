# PROCESS FOR IMPROVING THE CONVERSION OF TRIVALENT CHROMIUM IN ASH TO HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for improving the conversion of trivalent chrome in tannery or similar ash containing oxidizing chemicals or the like, comprising backwetting the ash and roasting the same. In a particular aspect the invention provides a pro cess for treating trivalent chrome treated leathers or the like for hexavalent chrome recovery therefrom, com prising said trivalent chrome treated leathers or the like alkaline incinerating the same in the presence of air and carbonate to recover chrome ash and backwet ting the ash and roasting the same to induce conversion of the chrome to the hexavalent state.
