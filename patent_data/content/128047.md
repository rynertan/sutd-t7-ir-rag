# The selective separation of heavy oil using a mixture of polar and nonpolar solvents.

## Abstract
A process shown in Figure 2 in which a heavy oil feed stock is contacted with a non poar solvent and a polar solvent to create a two phase mixture. The polar solvent extract con taining low molecular weight polars is separated. The remain ing phase is cooled to produce a three phase mixture which is separated into an asphaltene phase, a non polar raffinate containing saturates and aromatics and a final extract contain ing the remaining low molecular weight polars.
