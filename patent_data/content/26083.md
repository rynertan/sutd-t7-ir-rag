# Multi processor data processing system.

## Abstract
A central processor CPU 1 and associated system mem ory 3 utilise a word length which is a multiple of the word lengths employed by a satellite processor SPU 2 and its memory 4 , e.g. 16 bits as against 8 bits. DMA transfers of information are nevertheless possible via a transfer controller 5 including a series of intermediate registers 8,9,10 and 11 . To write from memory 4 into system memory 3 for exam ple, two 8 bit words are transferred sequentially from mem ory 4 to registers 8 and 9 . Then the contents of the registers are transferred in parallel as a 16 bit word to the system memory 3 . Conversely a 16 bit word can be read from sys tem memory 3 into the registers 10 and 11 . Two 8 bit words are then transferred sequentially from these registers to the memory 4 .

## Description
MULTI PROCESSOR DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM The present invention relates to a multi processor data processing system comprising at least two memories associated with two different processors and means for the transfer of data between the two memories. Multi processor systems are known, in which two or more processors converse between each other by means of a plurality of channels for the exchange of information. Generally, a main processor is associated with a system memory that processor processes the basic programs and performs functions of a general character. A plurality of secondary processors corr unicate with the main processor and are provided with smaller memories these processors control the peripheral units. Each secondary processor controls an input output device and processes specific programs of the peripheral units associated therewith. In this way, the system memory is entirely dedicated to the general programs and the main processor is relieved for the major part of the problems of controlling the input out and peripheral units.This thus results in a higher level of efficiency in the conversation beneen the central processor and peripheral units. The transfer of inform lion either beneen a peripheral unit and a memory of the secondary processor, or between such a memory and the system memory, can be facilitated by using DMA, that is to say, direct access to the memory involved in the exchange of information.For this purpose, there are devices which have a high degree of integration and which are known commercially as D.h A controllers that is to say, controllers for direct memory access . These controllers are programmed by the processor which is involved in performing an exchange of infcr ,ation and they autonomously performThe exchange of the desired number of words between the memory of the processor in question and one or more peripheral units or another memory. Such controllers have direct access to the memories in question, interrupting the processors connected thereto for the period of time required for performing the transfer operations. DMA information exchange, which may or may not be controlled by the appropriate controller, is always effected between memories with words of the same length. Consequently, in multi processor systems in which provision is made for direct transfers of information between the various processors, use is made of components with the same parallelism that is to say, which are capable of memorising information which is always of eight bits, always of sixteen bits, and so forth. However, it is advantageous to use a central processor with a high 16 or 32 bit processing capacity and commercial low cost 8 bit microprocessors for controlling the problems of input output of the various peripheral devices, each processor being provided with the corresponding memory Thus, there is the technical problem of easily and rapidly providing for direct transfers of operation between memories with different parallelism, This problem is solved in the multiprocessor system according to the invention which is characterised in that a memory is capable of memorising words of multiple length with respect to the words of the second memory and that transfer means comprise a plurality of registers corresponding to said multiple and each capable of containing a word whose length is equal to that of said second memory and means for sequentially addressing said plurality of registers for each transfer operation. These and other features of the invention will be more clearly apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment of the system according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is the general block circuit diagram of a multiprocessor system according to the invention, Figure 2 is the block circuit diagram of the transfer controller incorporated in the system according to the invention, Figure 3 is the circuit diagram of the secondary processor selected in the illustrated embodiment, Figures 4 to 7 show some possible positions in the two memories, of the transferred information Figure 8 is an electrical circuit diagram of the control circuit shown in the Figure 2 diagram Figure 9 shows the timing diagrams relating to the signals of the transfer controller Figure 10 shows details 7 e registers of Figure 2 and Figure 11 is a flow chart of the various operations controlled by the transfer controller. The multi processor system of Figure 1 comprises a central processing unit CPU 1 which is connected to a system memory 3 and which is connected by way of a channel BC to at least one programmable peripheral control 13. Each control 13 which controls at least one peripheral unit for example of the ribbon or video unit or the printing means comprises a secondary processor or satellite processor SPU 2 which is connected by way of a channel BS to a memory 4 and to a transfer controller 5. The main processing unit 1 may be any 16 or 32 bit computer or minicomputer which is on the market at the present time, while the secondary processor 2 may advantageously comprise an 8 bit microprocessor of commercial type. In the preferred embodiment described hereinafter, the secondary processor SPU 2 comprises a microprocessor of typeZILOG 280. The channel BS which in Figure 2 connects the processorSPU 2 to its own memory 4 and to the transfer controller 5 comprises an address channel ABS 16 bit , a channel DBS 8 bit and a control channel CB 4 bit . The central processing unit CPU 1 comprises a central 16 bit unit of the type described in the present applicants Italian patent No 1 016 854. This unit is connected to the system memory 3 and to the transfer controller 5 by means of an address 16 bit channel ABC , a 16 bit data channel DBC, and the control channel CB all together forming the channel BS in Figure 1. The transfer controller 5 comprises a control circuit 6. The control circuit 6 is capable of producing a preset enabling signal PE and a count down signal DONEA, which control an addressing register 7. The circuit 6 is also capable of generating a control channel RB which controls the input and the output of four registers 8, 9, 10 and 11 which are used for the exchange of information between the memories 3 and 4. It should be made clear at this pchzt that the transfers of information will be stated as being in the writing mode if in the direction from the memory 4 with 8 bits to the memory 3 with 16 bits , and will be stated to be in the reading mode, in the opposite case. In any transfer operation, the control circuit 6 assumes control of the addressing channels ABS and ABC and the control channel CB of both the processorsSPU 2 and CPU 1. If the transfer is in the writing mode, the control circuit generally addresses the memory 4 twice in succession, enables the registers 8 and 9 to memorise the two words successively present on the channel DBS, and controls the transfer in parallel of the two words, which is effected by means of the channel DBC, to the address indicated by the address register 7 of the memory 3. If the transfer is in the reading mode, in a similar manner, the registers 10 and 11 are used, being charged in parallel by means of a word of the memory 3 and being discharged sequentially to the memory 4. These operations are repeated automatically until the number of transfers for which the control circuit 6 is programmed is completed. BEen a transfer of a certain field of information between the two memories is necessary, the secondary processor SVU 2 inputs to the control circuit 6 by means of the data channel DBS and the address channel ABS particular words which are used for programming the number and the type of desired transfer operations and the address of the first region in the memory 4, which is involved in the exchange. The address of the memory 3 is predisposed by the secondary processor 2, charging the first address on the address register 7 which is enabled by the signal PE. If the transfer is in the readingmode, the control circuit 6, by means of a signal generated on a control channel CCB which connects the processing unit 1 to the control unit 6, places the central processing unit CPU 1 in an hold condition. The processing unit 1 is thus in a condition of isolation with respect to the memory 3 for a period of time equal to a cycle of access to the machine. During that period of time, the 16 bit information addressed by the address channel ABC is memorised, by means of the channel DBC, on the registers 10 and 11 which are opportunely enabled by the commands on the channel RB. At that point, the control circuit 6 inputs a hold request BUSRQ to the secondary processor 2 which accepts the request by generating an acknowledgment signal BUSACK. With that the secondary processor 2 is also in a hold condition. Owing to that, the control channel CB is connected to a control channelCBDMA which is generated by the control circuit 6 therefore the control circuit 6 is also in a condition of addressing memory 4 and generating signals for controlling the entire system.The two registers 10 and 11 which respectively contain the more significant part and the less significant part of the information from the memory 3 are discharged sequentially to the memory 4 at the addresses generated by the control circuit 6 on an address channel ASSDMA which is connected to the address channel ABS. This control cycle is repeated successively by the control circuit 6 until the number of transfer operations for which it had been programmed is completed. Obviously, in each cycle, both the address present on the register 7 and those generated on the channel ABSDMA are up dated. When the last byte writing operation envisaged has been performed, or when any anomoly gives rise to the necessity to suspend the transfer operations, the control circuit 6 generates an input signal FIDMO to the register 15 which contains given bit configurations referred to as interruption vectors . The register 15, in accordance with a process which is known per se and which is not described in greater detail hereinafter, inputs on channel IV to processor 2 an interruption signal INT, which is capable of restoring given working conditions in respect of the processor 2. Figure 3 shows the use of the various terminals of the microprocessor ZILOG Z80 used for carrying out the functions of the secondary processor in the present embodiment. The drawing clearly shows the correspondencies between the channels of Figure 1 and the various terminals of the microprocessor in question. As regards the various modes of operation of the processor and the use of various terminals, reference is made to the various publications issued by ZILOG. It should simply be stated that, upon the signal BUSRQ produced by the control circuit CC, the processor is isolated from the channels ABS and DBS or, as is stated in technical terms, it puts such channels in 1tri state and in return produces the signal BUSACK. The signa l BUSACK controls the tri state devices 16 and 17 in such a way as to connect to the channel CB under normal operating conditions of the microprocessor, the control signals MREQ,IORQ, RD and WR and, in hold conditions, the control channelCBDMA from the control circuit 6. The mode of operation described herein in the reading mode with reference to Figures 2 and 3 envisages access to the location of a 16 bit words the memory 3, and the break down by means of the registers 10 and 11 into two parts each of 8 bits, which will be respectively called the more significant byte and the less significant byte . In the event of a transfer in the writing mode, these operations take place in precisely the opposite manner. In addition, as will be seen more clearly from the description with reference to Figure 8, the control circuit 6 also controls exchanges of information between the two memories 3 and 4, which comprise selective access to the location of the more significant byte which will also be referred to as the first byte or to the less significant byte referred to as the second byte of each word of information of the memory 3. As regards the mode of access to the locations of the individual bytes in the memory 3, reference is also made to the above mentioned patent. Figures 4, 5, 6 and 7 diagrammatically show four different cases which can occur in the transfer of the first information word between the two type memories 3 and 4. These cases will be referred to respectively as DO of the first, second, third and fourth type. The transfer operations illustrated take place as from the location 22 of an information word in memory 3 or location 24 of a word of memory 4. The simplest transfer operations are those in the reading mode in Figure 4, being SQ. of the first type, and that in the writing mode of Figure 6, being DMA of the third type. These are coJicerned with the case in which both the locations 18 and 19 of the bytes which comprise the first information word at location 22 are involved in the transfer toor from the locations 24 and 25 of memory 4. In that case, access to the memory 3 is in relation to the entire information word, as already described with reference to Figure 2. The DMA of the second type as shown in Figure 5 is on the contrary the case involving a transfer in the reading mode, wherein only the second byte contained in the location 19 of the first information word read from the memory 3 is to be written in memory 4. In this case also, there occurs block transfer of the first information word from the position 22 of memory 3 to the registers 10 and 11 inFigure 2 however, the control circuit 6 is programmed for discharging on channel DBS only the register 11 containing the second byte and transferring it to position 24 in memory 4. After this, normal transfer operations of the first type will follow on, that is to say, the word contained at location 23 will go to positions 25 and 26, and so forth. The DMA of the fourth type as shown in Figure 7 is the case involving a transfer operation in the writing mode, wherein the first word read from the location 24 of memory 3 is to be transferred to the location 19 of the second byte in memory 3. In that case, the control circuit 6 is programmed so as to perform, during the first transfer cycle, one access to the memory 4, memorise the word read from the location 24 on the register 9 and finally enable the transfer thereof to memory 4, by accessing to the single location 19 of memory 3. The control circuit 6 see Figure 8 essentially comprises a programmable DMS controller 50 and two memories 51 and 52 of ROM type which are addressed by a counter 53 and a condition register 54. As regards the controller 50 which is used in the present embodiment, this is a multimode DMA controllerAM 9517t produced by Advanced Micro Devices. Therefore, for the electrical description of the controller 50, reference is made to the specifications issued by the company in question. It should be stated in the present description that the numbers of the various terminals are preceded herein by the letter P in order to avoid misunderstandings, and only the use of the main terminals connected to the other devices of the system according to the invention will be described herein. The controller 50 exchanges control signals by means of the channel CBDMA and the line BUSACK in particular with the secondary processor SPU 2 and its memory 4. The controller 50 is programmed in known manner for initiating the transfer operations between the two memories 3 and 4 on behalf of the processor 2, by way of the address channel ABSDNA. This programming includes the address of the first memory 4 location and the total number of locations in such memory which are involved in the information transfer operation to be carried out. Based on that data, the controller 50 will automatically address, by way of the channel ABSDMA, the locations in memory 4 which are intended to receive or give information, while it generates the appropriate commands by means of the control channel CBDMA. The ROM memories 51 and 52 essentially contain four routines, one for each type of transfer operation DNA of the first, second, third and fourth type. The address of the routine appropriate to the desired transfer operation is selected in the following way. A condition register 54 is charged for the desired transfer operation by the processor 2 by way of the channelDBS, and generates input signal PADIO and input signal SETRO to the memories 51 and 52. The signals PADIO and SETRO identify the two more significant bits of the address of the preselected routine and thus its position in the memory while a counter 53 produces by means of the signalsSAL 1 3, the successive addresses of the various locations within the preselected routine. Finally, two signalsDMFIO and FIDMN which are generated in the event of abnormal happenings during an information transfer operation force the addresses of particular control routines, discussed hereinafter. The commands generated by the memories 51 and 52, jointly with the commands and addresses generated by the controller 50, control the operations required for performing the transfer of information between the two memories. The remaining channels which connect the controller 6 to the other devices are the control channel CCB and the channel RB. All the control signals exchanged with the central processing unit CPU 1 pass through the channel CCB for a detailed description on the significance of those control signals, reference should again be made to the present applicants patent. Suitable combinations of signals present on the address channel ABSDM which are decoded by a decoder 56 represent as many initial commands transmitted by the secondary processor 2 to the control circuit 6. The channel RB contains all the command signals required for controlling the registers 9 to 11. Table 1 below shows the groups of logic states of the signals WP, WM and LAPIO, which are generated by a command register 55 which is necessary for selecting reading or writing of entire words or bytes in each of the two memories 3 and 4. Table 1 WP WMReading entire word from mem. 3 0 0 1Writing entire word in mem. 3 1 1 0Writing byte in mem. 3 1 0 0Writing byte in mem. 3 0 1 0Reading writing byte in mem. 4 0 X 1Reading writing byte in mem. 4 0 X ORead write single byte in mem. 4 1 X O The signals WP and WM also select the more significant or less significant byte in a word addressed in the memory 3. Their specific action will be set forth in the following circuit description. Referring to Figures 8 and 9 and to Table 2 below, which diagrammatically sets out a routine for commanding a transfer DMA of the first type, there is shown the sequence of signals of the circuit 6 during this type of transfer operation. In Table 2, in each columnbf the area N, there is shown the name of a corresponding signal of the address of theROM 51 and 52 and the content, that is to say, the word generated by the ROM corresponding to the address in question.

First of all, it predisposes at the controller 50, as stated, the initial address of the zone involved in the transfer and the number of pieces of information to be transferred, and secondly it predisposes by means of the channel DBS the condition register 54 in the case of DMA of the first type, the register 54 compels to a value 0 the signals PADIO and SETRO see Table 2 which select the appropriate region of the memory 51 and 52.Finally, by means of the channel ABS and the decoder 56, it activates the signal PE which permits programming of the address register 7 of Figure 2 with the initial address of the region of the memory 3 involved in the transfer. After this initialisation operation, and still by way of the channel ABSDMA and the decoder 5 6, the processor 2 activates a start signal STDMA. The first front edge of the signal STDMA will set to zero the counter 53 which will thus produce the configuration 000 on lines SAL 1 to 3. This configuration will address a first command word in the memories 51 and 52. As will be clear by viewing the first row in Table 2p this command word contains an address JMP 1 3 which predisposes the counter 53 for the next address, two signals LAPNO and DMESO at a high logic level and three remaining signals DMINO, PPWRO and PMWRO at a low level. If no irregularity in the transfer operation has occurred, the signal FIDMO which is at a low logic level enables an AND gate 60 and the signal DMESO activates the input RESDI of a flip flop 61. The logic levels of a signal DACK and a signal MERQ which are clearly visible from the diagrams in Figure 9 generate in this phase, by way of an AND gate 71, an enabling signal CDDMA which is applied to an input of an Agate 57 which produces a signal LADMA at its output. The signal LADMA is applied to the input of a flip flop 61 and an AND gate 58 which is enabled by a signal DO1iEA at a high logic level, and which produces a signal CARCA at its output. Consequently, the signal LADMA Not shown in Figure 9 and the signalCARCA re copy the signal STDMA, in this phase. At the rising edge of STDMA the flip flop 61 then switches over and lowers a signal REQON that signal is part of the channel CCB and effects a hold request to the processing unit CPU 1.At the same time, the signal CARCA enables the command register 51 to re output the same signals PFWRO, PMWRO, RIND 1 andLAPNO which respectively take the designations WP, WM, RDINO and LAPIO. The output signals of the memories 51 and 52 are at that time those generated by the word 01 of Table 2 if the signals WD, WM and LAPIO then respectively assume the values 0, 0 and 1 which designate the request in writing of an entire word from the memory 3. In particular, the signals WP and WM are part of the control channel CCB while the signal LAPIO enables an AND gate 63. The processing unit 1 acknowledges the request made by the signal REV ON by activating a signal ACK Figure 9 , and also produces a signal STARO which represents a start signal on the part of the central processing unit 1 to the circuit 6 these signals are also part of the control channel CCB. The signal ACK resets the flip flop 61 Figure 8 and thus the signal REQ QN while the signal STARO, by way of an OR gate 62, activates a clock signal CAINI for the counter 53. The address SAL 1 3 at the output of the counter 53 is increased consequently, the output commands of the memories 51 and 52 are up dated as at location 02 in Table 2 and as shown in Figure 9. The signal DMINO which is activated in place of the signal DMESO produces, by way of a gate 64, a signal RIND 1 which is inputted to the command register 55. The gate 64 is normally enabled and is disabled only in the event that the signal FIDMO signals abnormal transfer conditions, as will be seen hereinafter. At the same time, the memory 3 which is isolated from the processing unit CPU which is in a hold condition is addressed by the register 7 of Figure 2 and produces on channel DBC the required 16 bit information word. The presence vf the information word on the channel DBC is signalled by the validity signal DONEA. The signal DONEA which is activated by the processor 1 and which is included in the control channel CCB now has a double action it activates a signal ABOR by way of an AND gate 63 which is enabled during this phase of the operations by the signal LAPIO, and activates the signalCARCA, by way of the AND gate 58. The signal ABOR is part of the input channel RB to the registers 8 to 11 see Figure 2 and serves to enable the registers 10 and 11 to memorise the information word present on the channel DPC this will be more clearly evident from the detailed description of Figure 10. The signal CARCA which is active for the second time transfers to the output of the command register 55 the signal RIND 1 which takes the designation RDINO, while the other output s ignals remain constant. The signal RDINO activates, by way of an ANE gate 65 which is enabled by the high level of a signal ASF, the signal RDASI which is an input to the terminal PU of the circuit 50. This signal is then interpreted by the circuit 50 as a request for access DMA, from a peripheral unit. At that point, the DMA controller 50 activates the terminal P10 to effect a hold request to the relevant processor. In the present embodiment, the terminal 10 of the controller 50 activates the signal BUSRQ which, as pointed out with reference to Figures 2 and 3, puts the processor 2 in a hold condition and connects the control channel CBDMA of the controller 50 to the control channel CB. The processor 2 in turn signals its own hold situation by way of the signal BUSAQ inputted to the terminal P7 of the controller 50 and the controller 50 produces the commands required to produce the transfer to the memory 4 of the more significant byte and the less significant byte which are respectively stored in the registers 10 and 11 see Figure 2 . These commands consist of generation of the output signalDACK at the terminal P25 and of the address of the first memory 4 location involved in the transfer. The addresses are generated in known manner on the channelABDMA by the terminals P32 to P40 excluding the terminal P36 which generates the signal FISCA and the terminals P21 toP30 which can memorise a value on a register 66 enabled by the terminal P8. During generation of the address, the controller 50 successively activates the control signals OR and MEMW which are outputs at the terminals P1 and P4, the use of which is known from the above quoted publications. These two control signals and the output signals at terminalsP2 and P3 are logically exchanged by the gates 67, 68, 69 and 70 for the sole purpose of producing the signalsIORQ, MERQ, RQ and WR which are compatible with those generated by the processor SPU 2. As regards the logic of circuit of Figure 8, the two signals MERQ and DACK are of interest. The signals MERQ and DACK enable two AND gates 72 and 73 which respectively generate an enabling signal OUT 10 and an enabling signalOUT 11 respectively for the output of the register 10 and the register 11. The input signal LAPIO to the gates 72 and 73 activates firstly the signal OUT 10 and then the signal OUT 11 in order successively to pass the bytes contained in the registers 10 and 11, on the channel DBS of the memory 4, which is in the meantime addressed by the controller 50. In addition, the signals T Q and DACK, which are combined by way of the NPSJD gate 71, now lower the level of the signal CDDMA. The signal CDDMA and the signal LADMA copy the signal MERQ in this phase of the operations.The descending edge of the signal CDDNA activates by way of the gate CR 62 the clock signal CAINA whereby the counter 53 generates the address corresponding to the location 03 of Table 2. As will be seen, all the outputs of the memories ROM 51 and 52 are set to value 0 . The following ascending edge of the signal LADNA that is to say also of NERQA determines by way of the gate 5 8 an active edge of the input signal CARCA to the command register 55. The output signal LAPIO from the command register 55 is set at value 0 which determines enabling, as stated above, of the output of the register 11 and dispatch of the less significant byte to the memory 4 addressed with the second address by the DMA controller 50. A further descending edge of the signal MERQ again activates in the manner Just described above, the clock signal CAINA for the counter 53 whereby there is again generated the address of the location 01 of Table 2 and the command word is generated at the output from the memories 51 and 2, being required to effect reading of the next information word to be transferred. The cycle is thus automatically repeated until the information field to be transferred is exhausted, the number thereof being up dated in known manner by an internal register of the controller 50. The addresses of the locations 04, 05 and 06 of Table 2 are forced by the signals DMFIO and FIDMO in the cases in which the transfer operation is to terminate. The circuit of Figure 8 includes by way of example the circuits for automatically producing three types of interruption. The anomalous interruption signals are a signal INVO which is generated by the memory 3 and which indicates the condition of address outside of the permitted region of the memory and a signal FINEN which indicates an interruption produced by the processor SPU 2 for example by means of a routine which is processed in the time intervening between two transfers. The normal end of the programmed transfer operations is on the contrary indicated by the controller 50 by means of a signal FISCA which is generated by the terminal P36 in known manner. These signals are not shown in the diagrams of Figure 9. These three signals are respectively memorised by three flip flops 74, 76 and 75. The signal INVO is simply conditioned by means of anAND gate 77 by the high level of DONEA, that is to say, the absence of data on the channel DBC. When one of the flip flops 74 and 75 is activated by the corresponding interrupt signal, the output signalFIDMO of the OR gate 78 goes to a high logic level and the address of the words 04 or 05 of Table 2 is forced in the memories 51 and 52. On the contrary, in the event of interruption on the part of the processor SPU 2, the flipflop 76 reset by the signal CDDMA is activated and the signal DMFIO goes to a high logic level, producing the address of the word at location o6 of Table 2. The distinction between the words at locations 04 and 05, or between the types of interruption which has occurred, depends on the situation of memory 51 and 52 present at the moment of the interruption both the words addressed however represent a block for the circuit 6. The word at the location o6 on the other hand causes general reset of the signals. Other words can be programmed to produce any type whatever of control on the circuit 6 it is important to remember that each word always contains the address JMP 1 3 of the following word, by means of which the operations required for causing the interruption are linked together sequentially and the circuit 6 also proceeds in this case autonomously in such a way as to conclude the transfer operations without engaging the programs of the processors 1 or 2. Hitherto, reference has been made to a transfer DItA of the first type, that is to say, comprising the transfer of entire words 16 bits from the memory 3 to the memory 4. It is important to note that if the transfer is of the second type, that is to say, it comprises writing in the memory 4 the single second byte registered in the register 11, theDMA controller So must perform a single access in writing to the memory 4. This is effected by deactivating the request signal RDASI input on terminalPl9 as soon as the controller 50 has gained control of the memory 4. In the event ofDMA transfer of the second type in fact, the programs of the memories 51 and 52 which are not described but which can be readily deduced from the foregoing description are such as to produce a high level of the signal WP during the operation of writing in the memory 4 see also Table 1 . The signal WG controls an AND gate 82 in such a way that the output signal ASF is reset by the rising edge of the signal CODMA. The output signal RDASI of the gate 65 is also reset, as will be seen by the broken line in Figure 9, with the result that the controller is disenabled from effecting the second access to the memory 4. This mode of operation of the controller So is clearly described also in the above mentioned specifications issued by the company AMD . The other types of transfer operation are performed in a generally similar manner. The values of the signals which identify the remaining types of transfer operation are clearly set out in Table 1. In the cases of transfer in a writing mode for example one or other or both of the signals WG and WM are at high logic level corresponding to those signals is the selection in a certain location in memory 3 of the more significant byte or the less significant byte or both, and, in the circuit of Figure 8, the selective enabling of two ANI gates 79 and 80. The signal LAPIO also controls one of the two gates 79 and 80 for activating a signalIN 8 or a signal IN 9. As will be seen from the detailed view of Figure 10, the signals IN 8 and IN 9 respectively enable the registers 8 and 9 to memorise the word or words which are successively present on the channel DBS. The signal DACK also times the generation of the signalsIN 8 and IN 9.The signal LAPIO at a low logic level and the signal STARO Jointly control a flip flop 81 seeFigure 8 for generating a signal ABIR which in parallel enables the outputs of the registers 8 and 9 see Figure 10 . Referring to Figure 10, the practical connections and the number of lines forming each channel will now be clearly seen therein. A 16 bit word originating from the memory 3 on the channel DBC is divided into two 8 bit words, or bytes, on the channel 100 more significant byte and on the channel 101 less significant byte . In contrast, a 16 bit word directed towards the memory 3 is formed by the 16 outputs of the gate 102 more significant byte and the gate 103 less significant byte which are enabled simultaneously by the signal ABIR they are the signals MS and W2wI for enabling writing in the memory 3 of one of the two bytes or both bytes. An 8 bit word originating from the memory 4 on the channel DBS is inputted both to the register 8 and to the register 9 by means of the channels 104 and 105, but is memorised only in the register which is enabled by the corresponding signal IN 1 or IN 2 similarly, a word directed to the memory 4 is formed either by the 8 outputs of the gates 106 of the register 10 first byte to be written in the memory 4 or by the 8 outputs of the gates 107 of the register 11 second byte to be written in the memory 4 , which are enabled respectively by the signal OUT 10 and the signal OUT 11.The various functions which are performed automatically by the transfer controller 5 Figure 2 solve as many problems in the exchange of data between the memories 3 and 4 both in the case of access to the entire words of memory 3 and in the cases of access to the individual bytes and also in the cases of abnormal events during the transfer operations. The flow diagram of Figure 11 synthesizes the mode of operation of the controller S in the cases described hereinbefore and in some other cases. The blocks 127 and 128 represent initialisation of the address register 7 and the control circuit 6 see Figures 2 and 8 . With the selection 129, the operations diversify according to whether a transfer in the reading or writing mode is involved. The remaining blocks 130 137 which are shown in the left hand part of Figure 11 are concerned with transfers in the writing mode. Thus, the circuit 6 puts the memory 3 in a hold condition block 130 . Then, at block 131, the first word of memory 3 is transferred into the registers 10 and 11 with up dating of the address register 7.With block 132, the control circuit 6 puts the secondary processor SPU 2 in a hold condition and takes possession of the control and address channels CB and ABS respectively. The selection 133 distinguishes a transfer DMA of the first type from one of the second type. If the transfer is of the first type, the contents of the registers 10 and 11, that is to say, the more significant byte and the less significant byte are transferred sequentially to the memory 4 blocks 136 and 136 . At each transfer of a byte, a counter which is internal to the DMA controller 50, which is referred to asLL, is decremented. With the block 136, an end is put to the hold situation of the processor 2. The selections 13S and 137 represent the possibility, on each decrement, that the number of bytes to be transferred is exhausted, whereupon the secondary processor is interrupted in the ways described above. In the event that a transfer DMA of the second type is involved, only the less significant byte of the first word memorised on the register 11 is to be transferred, thus going directly from the block 133 to the block 136.After the block 137, the operations are repeated, starting from block 130, in the manner illustrated, until the programmed transfer is completed, that is to say, whenLL 0. The right hand part of Figure 11 synthesises the cases of transfer operations in the writing mode. The procedure is the reverse of the above described situation. First of all, with block 138, the control circuit 6 puts the processor 2 in a hold situation and gains control over the channels ABC or CB. The selection 139 distinguishes a transfer DICTA of the third type from one of the fourth type. If the transfer is of the third type, two words are memorised respectively in the register 8 and in the register 9 of Figure 2 in order respectively to form the more significant byte and the less significant byte of the word to be written in the memory 3 blocks 140 and 142 . In each transfer, tiie counter LL is decremented. If the number of words of the memory 4 to be transferred is exhausted with the word which is memorised in the register 8, being at block Ilil, that word is immediately written in the memory and an end signal for the processor 2 block 146 is generated. When the two registers 9 and 10 have memorised the respective bytes, the processor 1 is put into a hold condition block 143 and parallel transfer of the two bytes to the memory 3 is performed block 1ilk . After that, the hold situation for the processor 1 is terminated and the address counter 7 is incremented.If the counter LL has reached the value 0, the end signal is generated for the processor 2 selection l 5 , otherwise the circle is repeated starting from the block 138 until the programmed number of transfer operations has been completed. For the sake of simplicity, the diagrammatic view ofFigure 11 does not show the possibilities of anomalous interruption of the transfer operations between the memories 3 and 4, as described with reference to Figure 8. As stated hereinbefore, an anomaly signal can force given routines in respect of the memories 51 and 52.In the diagrammatic view of Figure 11, this can be represented merely by as many jumps forced at the moment of the interruption towards blocks representative of the routines which are predisposed to cause the interruption which has taken place. With reference to Figure 8 andTable 2, the automatic control of two interruptions for an anoma in the transfer operation in the course of performance was described that is to say, address outside the permitted memory 3 region indicated by the signalINVO or interruption from the secondary processor 2 indicated by the signal FINEN . It is evident that the memories 51 and 52 of Figure 8 can be programmed to produce the appropriate commands for any case whatever of interruption that the persons skilled in the art consider it appropriate to take into account and it is sufficient to proceed so that the interruption signal which may be generated determines the corresponding address of the memories 51 and 52 in order suitably to control the interruption which has occurred. In the preferred embodiment shown in Figure 2, use is made of two known processors 1 and 2 which are respectively capable of processing 16 and 8 bits. The use of processors which are capable of processing data of any number of bits whatever, provided that one is a multiple of the other, therefore involves trivial modifications in the circuits included in the transfer controller S of Figure 2.Indeed, it is sufficient in adapt the number of registers 8 to 11 to the degree of multiplication existing between the lengths of the data processed by the two processors, so as to break the words of the central processing unit 1 down into the necessary number of words of the secondary processor 2 and vice versa, and it is just as simple to program the memories 51 and 52 which may also comprise a single memory to generate the sequence of commands necessary for dealing with any number of such registers and the addressing of any memory with any transfer problem, according to the logic system used. In addition, the secondary processor SPU 2 used in the present embodiment generates 16 bit addresses which are suitable of addressing directly both the memory 3 and the memory 4. Even this finally is not a limitation, insofar as, in the case in which the processor 2 used has an address channel ABS which has a lower number of bits with respect to the address channel ABC of the memory 3, it is sufficient to use devices which are known to those skilled in the art. For example, memorisation on a suitable register of a part of the address required , as described with reference to the controller of Figure 8. Any other modifications or innovations derived from the present invention are deemed to be included within the scope of the invention.
