# Process of preparing copolymer of lower carboxylic acid and ester thereof.

## Abstract
A one pot process is taught for the preparation of a water soluble interpolymer starting with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or mixtures thereof, and a lower aliphatic alcohol. The process comprises concurrently converting the lower carboxylic acid to an ester, and polymerizing reactants and reaction products under reflux conditions in the copre sence of a strongly acid esterification catalyst and a free radical initiator for the polymerization and, recovering the copolymer. In the reaction mixture there is simultaneous formation i of water, the removal of which determines the amount of ester formed, and ii of polymer. The initiator survives the strongly acid esterification catalyst, and polymerization is not adversely affected by the formation of water and the presence of the esterification catalyst, despite elevated temperature conditions.
