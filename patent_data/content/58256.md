# Aqueous newsprint inks.

## Abstract
In an improved process for printing newsprint paper with a light weight keyless printing press system the mineral oil ink standardly used is replaced by an aqueous newsprint ink having a total solids content of about 13 80 and containing about 2 30 of a colorant consisting of a pigment and or dye, about 3 60 of a dispersed starch, and water to total 100 , wherein the percentages are by weight based on total weight of the ink. The ink may optionally contain a viscosity stabilizer if necessary to prevent retrogradation of the starch or a thickener. In a preferred embodiment the pigment is carbon black and the starch is a dextrin of waxy fluidity starch.
