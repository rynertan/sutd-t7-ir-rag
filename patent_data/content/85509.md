# Film cartridge manufacture and filling method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is provided for cartridging viscous explosives mixtures, such as emulsion explosives, in convoltely wound paper tubes. The method comprises winding a section of paper film on a rotating hollow mandrel, closing one end of the wound paper tube, injecting the explosives mixture through the hollow mandrel into the paper tube upon the mandrel, removing the filled tube from the mandrel and closing the tube open end. The method replaces higher cost plastic chub packages with low cost paper and allows the efficient and economic production of sensitive small diameter cartridges wherein the occluded air or gas is not dissipated cartridging.
