# Compact laser scanning system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a laser scanning system of compact size and relatively long focal length which my be used in a laser surface inspection system for silicon wafers and the like. The scanning system employs a folded optical cell 30 having a pair of reflective surfaces 31,32 so oriented that the scanning laser beam is folded, and reflects from each of the reflective surfaces several times to significantly increase the focal length. The folded optical cell is also effective to produce a collimated, substantially parallel scan pattern such that the beam remains perpendicular to the inspection surface as it is scanned. The folded optical cell can also be set for divergent or convergent scan.
