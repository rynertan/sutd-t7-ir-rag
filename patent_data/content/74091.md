# 2 1H pyridinones and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Novel 1 R1 3 Q 5 3 R min 4 R sec phenyl 6 R 2 1H pyridinones where R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower hydroxyalkyl, R is lower alkyl and, R min and R sec are each hydrogen, amino or hydroxy, at least one of R min or R sec being other than hydrogen, or R is nitro and R sec is hydroxy, are useful as cardiotonics. Also known compounds where R is hydrogen are useful as cardiotonics. Both novel and known compounds can be prepared by a novel process which comprises reacting 1 R1 1,2 dihydro 2 oxo 5 3 R min 4 R sec phenyl 6 R nicotinonitrile, where R1 and R are defined as above, R min is hydrogen, hydroxy, methoxy or amino and R sec is hydrogen, hydroxy, amino or methoxy, at least one of R min and R sec being other than hydrogen, or R min is nitro and R sec is hydroxy with 85 phosphoric acid.
