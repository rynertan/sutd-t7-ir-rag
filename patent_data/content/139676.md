## Description
The invention is related to description, production, and characterization of new specific hybridoma monoclonal antibodies recognizing common antigenic determinant s among the closely related proteins belonging to the HuIFN a system be they natively produced Interferons are now widely recognized as being an important group of biological proteins rendering cells or whole organisms resistant to virus attack the so called antiviral activity, cf. Stewart 1980 . Furthermore, interferons have proved to play a significant role in the regulation of the immune system One of the main difficulties observed during the beginning of the interferon research was the difficulties involved in the purification and characterization of the interferon proteins. It was believed that only one protein species existed in the human system, but later, it was shown by several investigators, e.g. Berg et al. 1975 , Stewart 1980 , Berg 1982 , that there indeed exist three main types of interferon in the human system Human Leukocyte Interferon HuIFN α , Human Fibroblast Interferon HuIFN β , and Human Immune Interferon HuIFN γ . HuIFN α has now been completely purified. Originally it was thought to consist of one single entity only, but later on, as the purification progressed, it turned out that HuIFN α consists of at least 6 7 different interferon protein species, and finally it was shown that at least 13 species exist Berg et al. 1980 , 1982a, b . These species were purified simultaneously by combining traditional techniques such as gelfiltration and the like with antibody affinity chromatography using antibodies from rabbits. The pure specie was next, in turn, used as immunogen whereby monospecific rabbit antibodies against the interferon proteins were produced by using only a single interferon specie e.g. 20.000 specie as immunogen. Thus, the monospecific, polyclonal rabbit antibodies were able to purify all species of HuIFN α simultanously when used in an antibody affinity column. This approach was followed by others employing immunoglobulins produced from hybridomas, e.g. Secher et al. 1980 . However, there was a serious drawback to this method only part of the interferon proteins was bound to the hybridoma column cf. Berg et al 1982, b . Usually, half of the interferon activity was found in the wash, and the other half was bound to the column and could be eluted specifically . Therefore, the impression was, generally speaking, that HuIFN α might not contain a common antigenic determinant, at least not as measured by means of the mouse hybridoma system. The present invention addresses itself to this problem. In the following it will be shown that it, now, indeed is possible to produce hybridoma produced antibodies immunoglobulins which are specific for at least one antigenic determinant common to the 12 species of Human Interferon alpha demonstrating activity in the human system and having molecular weights of at least 16000 in SDS PAGE, a species having a molecular weight of 16600 being excluded, as described by Berg et al. 1982a and 1982b . The invention is new and surprising compared to the previous knowledge. The implications of the present inventions are immanent The said immunoglobulins might also be produced by the now well known genetic engineering techniques, for example by means of the hybridoma cells producing the said immunoglobulins by first isolating the proper m RNA the specificity of which can be studied measured isolated by very well known standard techniques as for example illustrated in Methods in Enzymology, vol. 68 1981 , Recombinant Techniques. The purified m RNA, which can be tested for the correct specificity in oocytes by means of a semi solid binding assay of the translated product The said immunoglobulins will be very useful in different immunological assays employing, for example ELISA enzyme immuno or RIA radio immuno techniques or the like, in which the presence of a monoclonal antibody molecule or parts thereof , with the above specificity is essential. Thus, the said immunoglobulins may be very useful in immuno assays for detecting interferon proteins or parts thereof by means of conventional techniques see example Methods in Enzymology, vol. 70, part A, 1980 . It will also be possible to detect quantity quality the presence of interferon receptors which, in advance, have received interferon proteins, or parts thereof or the like since these entities also can be recognized by the above antibodies. It is contemplated that one of the reasons for being successful in obtaining the said hybridoma antibodies showing the remarkable binding properties can be found in the method for preparing the antigen preparations consisting of highly purified interferon proteins stabilized with SDS cf. Berg et al. 1980 , 1982a . The presence of SDS is thought to be an important factor in the presentation of the proteins to the immunocompetent cells in that the proteins in question e.g. interferon species are exposing all their antigenic determinants in the presence of SDS the proteins can also be pretreated with SDS before being confronted with the immunocompetent cells , due to the denaturating power of SDS, whereby otherwise hidden determinants are fully exposed. It is also within the scope of this invention to treat proteins, in general, with SDS before or simultaneously the immunization is carried out the purpose of this procedure being to obtain more hidden antigenic determinants which otherwise are not recognized. By employing this SDS approach during the course of immunization it is to be expected that the hybridoma antibodies against the most frequent determinants i.e. that or those found to be most common among all the proteins belonging to a protein mixture composed by related, but nevertheless, distinct proteins will be found more often when using such a denaturing approach during the course of preparing the relevant immunogens comprizing proteins, e.g. pure species of HuIFN α . This general principle applies also to other hybridoma systems apart from the murine system. The above findings correlate very well with the well known homology which has been shown to exist on the gene level, for the genes coding for HuIFN α, cf. Weissmann et al. 1982 . Since several regions are known to be constant cf. Weissmann et al. 1982 it is contemplated that this hybridoma, which is defined by the mere ability to recognize all species of HuIFN α, probably recognizes a specific determinant located in such a region, which is common for all the interferon species belonging to the HuIFN α species. It is also contemplated that the said antibody also might recognize MuIFN α having the same determinant as involved in the said specificity of the said antibodies. It is not known, at present, how widely distributed this determinant might be in the interferon system work is in progress . For immunization, isolation of a spleen lymphocyte mixture fusion and hybridization, growing of hybrids and selection, subcloning of hybrides producing the desired antibody and isolations of these hybrids or the corresponding antibodies, the reader is referred to numerous previously published descriptions, as f.x, Kohler et al. 1975 , 1976 , Lovborg 1982 , Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 70 1980 , Secher et al 1980 , Cellular Immunology, Vols. 1 3 1978 , Kennett, McKern Bechtol 1980 . Most of the plasmacytoma cell lines used to make hybridomas and some hybridomas producing antibodies are available from public cell distributing centers, such as for example The Salk Institute, Cell Distribution Center, P. O. Box 1809, San Diego, Ca. 92112, USA, or other similar places. The present cell line, used in this invention, was obtained from The Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository in New Jersey, Test for Mycolplasma was always performed since it was shown by others that the presence of mycoplasma very easily can hinder a successful hybridization. All myeloma cells were always checked 1 3 days before used. Only if the test turned out to be absolutely negative were the cells accepted for fusion. The institution of the mycoplasma test into the hybridization experiments greatly improved the numbers of positive hybridomas obtained in the fusion experiments, thus confirming similar observations performed by several groups cf. Lovborg 1982 . Were performed as previously described using for example VERO cells and VSV as chellenge virus see f.x. Berg et al. 1980 . All units are expressed into international units 69 19 B, MRC, UK . If very low amounts of interferon were to be detected the so called bovine system, comprising BMDK cells and VSV, was used since it turned out to be extremely reliable and very sensitive. As low as 0.1 units of interferon activity could easily be detected. Therefore, this system was widely used in the semi neutralization of hybridoma supernatants. Crude human leukocyte interferon was purified by gelfiltration followed by an antibody affinity chromatography yielding almost pure interferon proteins with a specific activity of 10⁸ units pr. mg. protein. Recovery was about 75 . The total eluate from a typical experiment contained 5 x 10⁶ units which was divided into 100.000 units containing aliquotes in 0.1 ml eluting buffer containing 0,1 SDS and kept at 20 C until used stable for at least 5 months cf. Berg et al. 1980 . Sometimes, less purified preparations of leukocyte interferon were also used inc. SDS . The Balb c mice preferentially female mice were immunized as follows The first injection 100.000 units was mixed with Freund s Adjuvans F.A. and given intra peritoneally I.P. . The following 5 8 injections were given as weekly injections but consisted only of 30.000 units and no F.A. was included. After 5 8 injections the mice developed antibodies to HuIFN α detected by the traditional neutralization test The simple traditional method for neutralization of interferon consists of mixing equal volume of interferon proteins containing a predetermined amount of interferon units with the antibody sample in question using several dilution step, see f.x. Berg 1982 . This method, however, will only recognize those antibodies reacting with the antigenic determinants close to the biological determinants on the interferon molecule s . Thus, as pointed out by Berg 1982 , it is quite possible that a great deal of antibodies will escape identification by using the traditional neutralization method only. To overcome this problem several ELISA tests were employed taking into account that f.x. sheep antibodies to HuIFN α produced out from partially purified HuIFN α by ethanolic precipitation, cf. Stewart 1980 bind all species of HuIFN α. Thus, immunoplates NUNC DENMARK were firstly coated with IgG solutions from a sheep antiinterferon serum followed by pure interferon proteins and after a suitable incubation the samples from the hybridomas were added and finally rabbit antimouse IgG galatosidase conjugates were added, as detailed in details in f.x. Methods in Enzymology, vol. 70, part A, 1980 . This method turned out, however, to yield too many false positive results in the sense that ELISA positive supernatants did not turn up as positives in the semi solid neutralization test This method was developed in order to test ELISA positive samples. The test takes advantage of the very simple fact that a possible antibody molecule directed against HuIFN α will bind to the interferon molecule. Therefore, if one first immobilizes the possible antibody which can be done by another antibody directed against the said possible antibody before adding an exact, but small amount of interferon, preferably as low as 0,1 units in total wide the section of titration of interferon a very small drop in the interferon titer content could easily be detected using the bovine system. This system proved superior to the ELISA system. The following method was used Positive clones, identified as described above, were divided into several subclones by means of the limited dilution technique using conditioned medium and feeder layers peritoneal macrophages from Balb c mice such as described in details by Lovborg 1982 . The subcloned hybridoma were all checked regularly for binding activity and if positive persistently the cells were allowed to grow further before injected I.P. into balb c mice which had received an immunostimulator in advance f.x. Pristane, 4 6 days in advance . After 5 15 days depending on the amount of injected cloned cells new hybridoma cells of the correct specificity can be harvested together with large volumes of ascites fluids containing the desired antibody in an extreme high concentration about more than 95 of all the immunoglobulins present are of the desired specificity . The hybridoma cells are separated from the ascites fluid subsequent to a centrifugation and can now, in turn, be used for another injection in new mice Balb c mice whereby more ascites fluids can be obtained together with more hybridomas, and so forth, taking into account, that the hybridoma cells harvested from one mouse can be used for production of 20 new mice each yielding approximately the same number of hybridoma cells as the first. The hybridoma cells may also be grown Since it is well known that the antibodies produced in ascites fluids are highly succeptible to proteolytic degradation from the proteolytic enzymes present in the ascites fluid the harvested ascites fluids were first cooled to 4 C and centrifuged to remove hybridoma cells and other debris before treated with ammonium sulphate whereby the immunoglobulins were presipitated. This isolation was performed immediately after harvesting the ascites fluids. The ammonium sulphate precip. immunoglobulins were kept at 20 C. Before titration a small aliquote was dissolved in f.x. 5 ml of medium, dialyzed versus 1 liter of PBS, before being checked in the semi solid neutralization test. The immunoglobulins were further purified by traditional methods such as gelfiltration, ionexchange chromatography, and the like. The mouse myeloma cell line used in the present invention is characterized as follows Mouse Myeloma, line P3 x 63 NSl, HPRT deficient, produces Kappa, non immunoglobulin secreting. Medium contains 4.500 mg glucose pr. liter. The above line was obtained from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository under cataloque nr. GM 3573 , Copewood and Davies Street, Camden, New Jersey, 08103, USA. NIH Publication no. 81 20011, Revised Oct. 1981 . The myeloma cells were grown in the same media composition as described by numerous other investigators, cf. Lovborg 1982 , using RPMI 1640, 10 calf serum new born , containing penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin together with Napyruvate etc. as described by for example Lovborg 1982 . The ascites fluids, which include the hybridoma cells of the desired specificity, are harvested from several mice One ampule is thawed by immersion into a 37 C warm water bath. After centrifugation the cells are resuspended in new medium and counted and adjusted to contain 10⁴ 10⁵ cells pr ml. The medium is changed after 24 hours or possibly earlier, in case the cells already have adhered. The further growing is detailed described by Lovborg 1982 . Alternatively, the thawn cells from the ampoule is directly injected into a Balb c mouse I.P. whereby new cells and ascites fluid containing the desired antibody can be harvested in 3 7 days depending on the amounts of cells injected . Primary human amnion cells obtained from the department of gynaecology are seeded on small cover slips of glass and after attachment the cover slips are ready for use the cells should not reach each other as confluency tends to lower the sensitivity . The sample, consisting of the myeloma cells, is added to the surface of the cover slip about 10 15 drops of the sample by means of a Pasteur pipette and the cover slip containing the sample is carefully wrapped into a plastic film to avoid evaporation. If the original sample, consisting of myeloma cells, were infected by mycoplasma, the same mycoplasma would also infect the amnion cells. Normally, the latter are free from mycoplasma infections when taken fresh. cf. later control cultures . On the following day the cultures are stained by means of Hoechst Stain for 2 hours, according to the staining procedure given by the manufacturer Hoechst, W. Germany 1 2 grains of the stain is dissolved into 5 ml buffer at pH 5,5. Only a few drops should be used in the actual staining since the pH 5,5 is below physiological range 7,2 . The stain is incubated for 2 hours with the cells, after which, the cells are fixed with methanol and dried. If the amnion cells have been infected with the mycoplasma stemming from the original sample small fluorescencing particles will clearly be seen in a fluorescencemicroscope as an indication for mycoplasma infection. If no fluorescing particles are found no infection has occurred. A control culture i.e. only amnion cells is also included. the latter should be negative . When the myeloma cells were found to contain mycoplasmas they were discarded and fresh, mycoplasma free, myeloma cells were taken from the cell freezer liquid nitrogen container . One female Balb c mouse was immunized as described in the section. Immunization Semi solid neutralization assays were simultaneously performed during the above experiments. The first two positive clones, however, did only neutralize the native human leukocyte interferon from virus induced buffy coats partially, although the supernatants from the primary hybridoma cultures could be diluted more than 100 fold without reaching an end point. The same tendency, at a much higher level, was seen when the LO 22 was grown as an ascites tumor at a dilution of more than 1 In order to obtain more detailed and precise information about the binding capabilities of the LO 22 hybridoma antibody it was decided to carry out an antibody affinity chromatography taking into account that only half or even less of the applied leukocyte interferon would be expected to bind cf. the partial neutralization observed on p. 17 . The immunoglobulins from 3 ml of ascites fluid from the original mouse which had received only about 1000 cells I.P. was isolated In order, further to analyze the binding properties of the LO 22 column, the wash consisting of 2,0x10⁵ human interferon units, cf. table 2 was concentrated to about 4 ml by means of sucrose and dialysis tubing, cf. Berg et al 1980 before being loaded back on the LO 22 column. The second wash was titrated in both human and bovine systems and the following results were obtained less than 100 units bovine were detected, whereas, about 50.000 units human were detected. Furthermore, the second wash consisting of about 50.000 human units was able to neutralize anti HuIFN β completely by means of the traditional neutralization test The eluate from LO 22 column table 2 was analyzed on analytical thin slab SDS PAGE using gradient gels, 12 24 , 25 cm long, cf. Berg. et al. 1980 , 1982a , 1982b and an identical pattern of HuIFN All 12 species were found to be located in the usual molecular weight range of 16.000 25.000 which is in complete agreement with previously described reports concerning the location and numbers of species present in a HuIFN α preparation Berg et al. 1982a , 1982b . Probably, the LO 22 column is also able to recognize not previously detected species of HuIFN α with a higher molecular weight since fractions containing interferon activity were also found around 30.000 fraction 14 15 and 16 yielding 600 human units 1000 bovine units 1400 1800, and 60 180 . These fractions are presently being more closely investigated. The above results from the antibody affinity chromatography are, somehow, in contradiction to the results obtained by the semi solid neutralization method table 1 indicating only a partial binding of the species of HuIFN The immunoglobulins produced from the LO 22 hybridoma cells were characterized as belonging to the IgG class by means of Ouchterloni tests in which several fractions of the ascites fluids and supernatants from cultured LO 22 cells were checked against rabbit antimouse immunoglobulins DAKO PATT Denmark Behring Werke W. Germany or goat antimouse IgG F ab ₂ Cappel or goat antiIgM heavy chain Cappel . Several controls were included the NSl cells alone yielded, as expected, no positive reaction against for example IgG . A heavy precipitate was seen especially between the hybridoma antibodies, LO 22, and goat antimouse IgG F ab ₂ antiserum Cappel . The above experiments which are detailed described have proved the following The monoclonal antibodies hybridoma and the corresponding hybridoma cells including derived hybrid cells which are able to recognize protein or part s thereof belonging antigenically to the Human Leukocyte Interferon System HuIFN α can be used as universal antibodies for purification and characterization of all the above mentioned proteins belonging to the HuIFN α system.
