## Description
NONAPEPTIDE AND DECAPEPTIDE DERIVATIVES OF LUTEINIZING HORMONE RELEASING HORMONEBackground of the Invention Luteinizing hormone LH and follicular stimulating hormone FSH are released from the anterior pituitary gland under the control of the releasing hormone LH RH produced in the hypothalamic region. LH and FSH act on the gonads to stimulate the synthesis of steroid hormones and to stimulate gamete maturation. The pulsatile release of LH RH, and thereby the release of LH and FSH, controls the reproductive cycle in domestic animals and humans. Additionally, LH RH has effects in placenta, in releasing HCG, and directly on the gonads. Agonist analogs of LH RH are useful for the control of fertility by two mechanisms of action. Low doses of LH RH analogs can stimulate ovulation and are useful in the treatment of hypothalamic and ovulatory infertility.Additionally they can be used for hypogonadal conditions and impotence, and stimulate spermatogenesis and androgen production in the male. Paradoxically, larger doses of highly potent and long lasting analogues of LH RH have an opposite effect and block ovulation in the female and suppress spermatogenesis in the male. Related to these effects is a suppress ion of normal circulating levels of sexual steroids of gonadal origin, including reduction in accessory organ weight in the male and the female. In domestic animals this paradoxical effect promotes weight gain in a feed lot situation, stimulates abortion in pregnant animals and in general, acts as a chemical sterilant. The natural hormone releasing hormone LH RH is a decapeptide comprised of naturally occuring amino acids which have the L configuration except for the achiral amino acid glycine . Its sequence is as follows pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr Gly Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2. Many analogues of this natural material have been studied and the very large majority of them have proven to be of insufficient biological activity to be clinically useful. Certain select modifications have proven to have a beneficial effect on biological activity. By far the most significant modification us obtained by changing the 6 position residue from Gly to a D amino acid. For example, replacing the Gly residue in the 6 position by D Ala,D Leu, D Phe or D Trp has led to a series of analogues of LH RH with increased activity relative to LH RH. SeeM.Monahan, et al, Biochem., 12, 4616 1973 for D Ala6 LHRH J. A. Vilchez Martinez, et al, Biochem. Biophys.Res. Comm., 59, 1226 1974 for D Leu6 LHRH and desGlyl0 D Leu6, Pro NHEt9JLHRH D. H.

Coy, et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 67, 576 1979 for D Trp6JLHRH. In addition to the substantial increases in activity obtained by the above referred to substitutions in position 6, further increases in activity may be obtained by eliminating the Gly NH2 in position 10 to afford a nonapeptide as an alkyl , cycloalkyl or fluoroalkylamide, or by replacing Gly NH2 by an a azaglycine amide. See for example, M. Fujino, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res.Comm., 49, 863 1972 , D. H. Coy, et al, Biochem. 14, 1848 1975 and A.S. Dutta, et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1979, 379. Substitution of N methyl leucine for the leucine residue in position 7 leads to increased stability towards enzymatic degradation. See for example, N. Ling, et al, Biochem Biophys. Res. Comm., 63, 801, 1975 . Substitution of the tryptophan residue in position 3 by 3 1 naphthyl L alanine leads to an increase in biological potency. See for example, K.U. Prasad, et al,J. Med. Chem., 19, 492 1976 and Y. Yabe, Chem. Pharm.Bull., 24 12 , 3149 1976 . The tyrosine residue in position 5 can be replaced by phenylalanine or 3 1 pentafluorophenyl L alanine with the retention of substantial biological activity.See for example, N. Yanaihara, et al, Biochem. Biophys.Res. Comm., 52, 64 1973 , and D. Coy, et al, J. Med.Chem., 16, 877 1973 . It would be desirable to prepare further analogues of LH RH which have even a higher degree of biological activity than those heretofore described and which can be used clinically in animals and humans.Summary of the Invention The present invention refers to novel nonapeptide and decapeptide derivatives of LH RH which have, in the 6 position, certain lipophilic D amino acids. The invention is also directed to various methods of use of these compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions therefor. A further aspect of the invention involves processes for the preparation of the novel compounds described above and to intermediates useful in such processes.Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to novel nonapeptide and decapeptide derivatives of LH RH.

More specifically the compounds of the present invention are nonapeptides and decapeptides of the formula pyro Glu His V Ser W X Y Arg Pro Z I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein V is tryptophyl, phenylalanyl or 3 1 naphthyl Lalanyl W is tyrosyl, phenylalanyl or 3 1 pentafluoro phenyl L alanyl X is a D amino acid residueEMI4.1 wherein R is a a carbocyclic aryl containing radical selected from the group consisting of naphthyl, anthryl, fluorenyl, phenanthryl, biphenylyl, benzhydryl and phenyl substituted with three or more straight chain lower alkyl groups or b a saturated carbocyclic radical selected from the group consisting of cyclohexyl substituted with three or more straight chain lower alkyl groups, perhydronaphthyl, perhydrobiphenylyl, perhydro 2 , 2 diphenylmethyl and adamantyl Y is leucyl, isoleucyl, nor leucyl orN methyl leucyl Z is glycinamide or NH R1, wherein R1 is lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, fluoro lower alkyl orEMI5.1 wherein R2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. As set forth above and for convenience in describing this invention, the conventional abbreviations for the various common amino acids are used as generally accepted in the peptide art as recommended by the IUPAC IUBCommission on Biochemical Nomenclature, Biochemistry, 11, 1726 1972 and represent L amino acids with the exception of the achiral amino acid glycine and with the further exception of the amino acids in the 6 position designated by X. All peptide sequences mentioned herein are written according to the generally accepted convention whereby the N terminal amino acid is on the left and the C terminal amino acid is on the right. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart any undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts are a acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like and salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acids, naphthalenedisulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid b salts with polyvalent metal cations such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and the like or with an organic cation formed from N, N dibenzylethylene diamine or ethylenediamine or c combinations, of a and b , e.g. a zinc tannate salt and the like. As used herein the term lower alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl and tert butyl the term cycloalkyl group refers to a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl the term fluoro lower alkyl refers to a lower alkyl group wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine, such as, for example, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl, and the like. As used herein naphthyl is inclusive of 1 and 2 naphthyl Zanthrylw is inclusive of 1 , 2 and 9 anthryl wfluorenyl is inclusive of 2 ,3 ,4 and 9 fluorenyl phenanthryl is inclusive of 2 ,3 , and 9 phenanthryl and adamantyl is inclusive of 1 and 2 adamantyl. Preferred compounds of this invention are those wherein X is 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl or 3 2,4,6 trimethylphenyl D alanyl Z is glycinamide or NHEt V is tryptophyl or phenylalanyl W is tyrosyl and Y is leucyl or N met1hyl leucyl. Particularly preferred compounds are pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2, pyro G1u His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl N methyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2, pyro Glu His Phe Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro G1y NH2, pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2,4,6 trimethyl phenyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2, pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro NHEt, and pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl N methyl Leu Arg Pro NHEt, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Especially preferred is pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 and its salts. The compounds of this invention and, particularly, the salts thereof, exhibit surprisingly potent and long lasting LH RH agonist activity in comparison to the previously most potent LH RH agonists, namely pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr D Trp Ser Arg Pro Gly NH2 and the corresponding prolylethylamide. A primary measure of potency is the ability to partially or completely suppress estrus in normally cycling adult female rats determined over a 2 week period by twice daily subcutaneous injection. Other bioassays which have been used for LH RH analogues and which have been used for compounds of the present invention include a ovulation induction in diestrous or proestrous female rats by subcutaneous injection Rippel, et al,Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 148, 1193 1975 , b LH and FSH release by dispersed anterior pituitary cell cultures as measured by radioimmunoassay Vale, et al, Endocrinology, 91, 562 1972 , and c LH and FSH release into the peripheral circulation of ovariectomized, steroid treated rats in response to intravenous injection as measured by radioimmunoassay Arimura, et al, Endocrinology, 90, 163 1972 . On a more advanced level, activity for these compounds may be demonstrated in vivo by depression of spermatogenesis and circulating and testicular levels of testosterone as well as dramatic reduction in prostate size in dogs suffering from benign prostatic hypertrophy. As a result of the above the compounds may find use in a large variety of situations where control of LE andFSH, or direct gonadal action is important, including Physiological utilities low dose effects ovulation induction in anovulatory infertility and for timed ovulation in female mammals therapy for infertility due to insufficient luteal function in women therapy for hypogonadotrophic or hypogonadal infertility in either sex human. therapy for cystic ovary nymphomania syndrome in cattle induction or enhancement of sexual behaviour or therapy for impotence frigidity.Paradoxical utilities high dose effects female contraception ovulation suppress ion or delay induction of parturition synchronization of ovulation estrus suppression growth promotion in female animals luteolysis, menses induction early, first trimester abortifacient therapy for endometriosis therapy for mammary tumors and cysts therapy for polycystic ovary syndrome Stein Leventhal therapy for uterine carcinoma therapy for benign prostatic hypertrophy and for prostatic carcinoma male contraception therapy for diseases which result from excessive gonadal hormone production in either sex functional castration in male food producing animals suppression of proestrous discharge. Furthermore, these compounds as well as prior artLH RH compounds demonstrate a surprising new utility as abortifacient agents apparently by inhibiting circulating levels of HCG and having a direct effect on the placenta. The placental effect could suggest utility against chor iocarcinoma. Another aspect of the present invention relates to particular uses for the above described compounds, including uses not heretofore described for LH RH analogues namely their uses for inhibiting ovulation i.e. contraception in the female, in the management of endometriosis, in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and in the inhibition of spermatogenesis i.e. contraception in the male. Thus, in these aspects, the invention is directed to a method useful for inhibition of ovulation, management of endometriosis, reduction of prostate size or inhibition of spermatogenesis in a mammalian subject having need of or desiring, said treatment which comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound of the present invention as hereinabove described or a pharmaceutical composition containing same. In the practice of the method of this invention an effective amount of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition containing same is administered to the subject in need of, or desiring, such treatment. These compounds or compositions may be administered by any of a variety of routes depending upon the specific end use, including orally, parenterally including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration , vaginally particularly for contraception , rectally, buccally including sublingually , or intranasally. The most suitable route in any given case will depend upon the use, particular active ingredient, the subject involved, and the judgment of the medical practitioner. The compound or composition may also be administered by means of slow release, depot or implant formulations as described more fully hereinbelow. In general for the uses hereinabove described, which are so called paradoxical or high dose uses, it is expedient to administer the active ingredient in amounts between about 0.01 and 100 pg kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.1 and 5.0 pg kg body weight per day. This administration may be accomplished by a single daily administration, by distribution over several applications or by slow release in order to achieve the most effective results. The exact dose and regimen for administration of.these compounds and compositions will necessarily be dependent upon the needs of the individual subject being treated, the type of treatment, the degree of affliction or need and, of course, the judgment of the medical practitioner. In general, parenteral administration requires lower dosage than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. The present compounds are well tolerated and relatively non toxic. Representative compounds show LD501s by subcutaneous administration to mice well in excess of 40 mg kg, a very large safety factor in comparision to the therapeutic dosages referred to above. A further aspect of the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient a compound of the present invention which compositions comprise such compound in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable, non toxic carrier. As mentioned above, such compositions may be prepared for use for parenteral subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration particularly in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions for use in vaginal or rectal administration particularly in semisolid forms such as creams and suppositories for oral or buccal administration particularly in the form of tablets or capsules or intranasally particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops or aerosols. The compositions may conveniently be administered in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, for example as described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, MackPublishing Company, Easton, PA., 1970. Formulations for parenteral administration may contain as common excipients sterile water or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes and the like. Formulations for vaginal or rectal administration, e.g. suppositories, may contain as excipients, for example, polyalkyleneglycols, vaseline, cocoa butter, and the like. Formulations for inhalation administration may be solid and contain as excipients, for example, lactose or may be aqueous or oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops.For buccal administration typical excipients include sugars, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, pregelatinated starch, and the like. It is particularly desirable to deliver the compounds of the present invention to the subject over prolonged periods of time, for example, for periods of one week to one year from a single administration.Various slow release, depot or implant dosage forms may be utilized. For example, a dosage form may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic salt of the compound which has a low degree of solubility in body fluids, for example , a an acid addition salt with a polybasic acid such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalene mono or di sulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid, and the like b a salt with a polyvalent metal cation such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and the like, or with an organic cation formed from e.g., N,N dibenzylethylenediamine or ethylenediamine or on c combinations of a and b e.g. a zinc tannate salt. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention or, preferably, a relatively insoluble salt such as those just described, may be formulated in a gel, for example, an aluminum monostearate gel with, e.g.sesame oil, suitable for injection. Particularly preferred salts are zinc salts, zinc tannate salts, pamoate salts, and the like. Another type of slow release depot formulation for injection would contain the compound or salt dispersed or encapsulated in a slow degrading, non toxic, non antigenic polymer such as a polylactic acid polyglycolic acid polymer for example as described in U.S. 3,773,919. The compounds or, preferably, relatively insoluble salts such as those described above may also be formulated in cholesterol matrix silastic pellets, particularly for use in animals. Additional slow release, depot or implant formulations, e.g. liposomes, are well known in the literature. See, for example, Sustained and ControlledRelease Drug Delivery Systems , J. R. Robinson ed.,Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.Particular reference with respect to LH RH type compounds may be found, for example, in U.S. 4,010,125. The polypeptides of the present invention may be synthesized by any techniques that are known to those skilled in the peptide art. An excellent summary of the many techniques so available may be found in J.M. Stewart and J.D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis , W.H.Freeman Co., San Francisco, 1969, and J. Meienhofer, Hormonal Proteins and Peptides , Vol. 2, p. 46.,Academic Press New York , 1973 for solid phase peptide synthesis and E. Schroder and K. Lubke, The Peptides ,Vol. 1, Academic Press New York , 1965 for classical solution synthesis. In general, these methods comprise the sequential addition of one or more amino acids or suitably protected amino acids to a growing peptide chain. Normally, either the amino or carboxyl group of the first amino acid is protected by a suitable protecting group. The protected or derivatized amino acid can then be either attached to an inert solid support or utilized in solution by adding the next amino acid in the sequence having the complimentary amino or carboxyl group suitably protected, under conditions suitable for forming the amide linkage. The protecting group is then removed from this newly added amino acid residue and the next amino acid suitably protected is then added, and so forth.After all the desired amino acids have been linked in the proper sequence, any remaining protecting groups and any solid support are removed sequentially or concurrently, to afford the final polypeptide. By simple modification of this general procedure, it is possible to add more than one amino acid at a time to a growing chain, for example, by coupling under conditions which do not racemize chiral centers a protected tripeptide with a properly protected dipeptide to form, after deprotection, a pentapeptide. A particularly preferred method of preparing compounds of the present invention involves solid phase peptide synthesis. In this particularly preferred method the amino function of the amino acids is protected by an acid or base sensitive group. Such protecting groups should have the properties of being stable to the conditions of peptide linkage formation, while being readily removable without destruction of the growing peptide chain or racemization of any of the chiral centers contained therein. Suitable protecting groups are t butyloxycarbonyl Boc , benzyloxycarbonyl Cbz , biphenylisopropyloxycarbonyl, t amyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, a ,a dimethyl 3 ,5 dimethoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, o nitrophenylsulfenyl, 2 cyano t butyloxycarbonyl, 9 fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl and the like, especially t butyloxycarbonyl Boc . Particularly preferred side chain protecting groups are, for arginine nitro, p toluenesulfonyl, 4 methoxybenzenesulfonyl, Cbz, Boc and adamantyloxycarbonyl for tyrosine benzyl, o bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, 2, 6 d ichloro benzyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl and acetyl for serine benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl for histidine benzyl, toluenesulfonyl and 2,4 dinitrophenyl. The C terminal amino acid is attached to a suitable solid support. Suitable solid supports useful for the above synthesis are those materials which are inert to the reagents and reaction conditions of the stepwise condensation deprotection reactions, as well as being insoluble in the media used. Suitable solid supports are chloromethylpolystyrene divinylbenzene polymer, hydroxymethyl polystyrene divinylbenzene polymer, and the like, especially chloromethyl polystyrene 1 divinylbenzene polymer. For the special case where the C terminus of the compound will be glycinamide, a particularly useful support is the benzhydrylamino polystyrene divinylbenzene polymer described by P. Rivaille, et al, Helv. Chim.Acta., 54, 2772 1971 . The attachment to the chloromethyl polystyrene divinylbenzene type of resin is made by means of the reaction of the Na protected amino acid, especially the Boc amino acid, as its cesium, tetramethylammonium, triethylammonium, 4,5 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 5 ene, or similar salt in ethanol, acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide DMF , and the like, especially the cesium salt in DMF, with the chloromethyl resin at an elevated temperature, for example between about 40 and 600C, preferably about 50 C, for from about 12 to 48 hours, preferably about 24 hours.The Na Boc amino acid is attached to the benzhydrylamine resin by means of an N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC l hydroxybenzotriazole HBT mediated coupling for from about 2 to about 24 hours, preferably about 12 hours at a temperature of between about 10 and 500C, preferably 250C in a solvent such as dichloromethane or DMF, preferably dichlormethane. The coupling of successive protected amino acids can be carried out in an automatic polypeptide synthesizer as is well known in the art. The removal of the Na protecting groups may be performed in the presence of, for example, a solution of trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride, hydrogen chloride in dioxane, hydrogen chloride in acetic acid, or other strong acid solution, preferably 50 trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane at about ambient temperature.Each protected amino acid is preferably introduced in approximately 2.5 molar excess and the coupling may be carried out in dichloromethane, dichloromethane DMF mixtures, DMF and the like, especially in methylene chloride at about ambient temperature. The coupling agent is normally DCC in dichloromethane but may be N,N di iso propylcarbodiimide or other carbodiimide either alone or in the presence of HBT, N hydroxysuccinimide, other N hydroxyimides or oximes. Alternately, protected amino acid active esters e.g. p nitrophenyl, pentafluorophenyl and the like or symmetrical anhydrides may be used. At the end of the solid phase synthesis the fully protected polypeptide is removed from the resin. When the linkage to the resin support is of the benzyl ester type, cleavage is by means of aminolysis with an alkylamine or fluoroalkylamine for peptides with a proline C terminus, or by aminolysis with, for example, ammonia methanol or ammonia ethanol for peptides with a glycine C terminus at a temperature between about 10 and 500C, preferably about 250C, for between about 12 and 24 hours preferably about 18 hours. Alternatively, the peptide may be removed from the resin by tranesterification, e.g., with methanol, followed by aminolysis.The protected peptide may be purified at this point by silica gel chromatography. The removal of the side chain protecting groups from the polypeptide is performed by treating the aminolysis product with, for example, anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride in the presence of anisole or other carbonium scavenger, treatment with hydrogen fluoride pyridine complex, treatment with tris trifluoroacetyl boron and trifluoroacetic acid, by reduction with hydrogen and palladium on carbon or polyvinylpyrrolidone, or by reduction with sodium in liquid ammonia, preferably with liquid hydrogen fluoride, and anisole at a temperature between about 10 and 100C, preferably about OOC, for between about 15 minutes and 1 hour, preferably about 30 minutes., For the glycine terminal peptides on the benzyhydrylamine resins, the resin cleavage and deprotection steps may be combined in a single step utilizing liquid hydrogen fluoride and anisole as described above. The fully deprotected polypeptide is then purified by a sequence of chromatographic steps employing any or all of the following types ion exchange on a weakly basic resin in the acetate form hydrophobic adsorption chromatography on underivatized polystyrene divinylbenzene for example Amberlite XAD silica gel adsorption chromatography ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose partition chromatography, e.g. on Sephadex G 25, or countercurrent distribution high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , especially reverse phase HPLC on octyl or octadecylsilyl silica bonded phase column packing. If a racemic amino acid is used in the 6 position, the diastereomeric nonapeptide or decapeptide final products are separated, and the desired peptide containing a D amino acid in the 6 position is isolated and purified, preferably during the above described chromatographic process. The preparation of peptides having C terminal azaglycine amides is preferably done using classical peptide solution synthesis using known peptide intermediates. This is described in more detail inExample 3.

A solution of 0.1 g of the hydrogen fluoride salt of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 See Example 1 is dissolved in 50 mL of water and passed through a column of 50 g Dowex 3 anion exchange resin which had previously been equilibrated with acetic acid and washed with deionized water.The column is eluted with deionized water and the effluent is lyophilized to yield the corresponding acetic acid salt of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2, a 85 27.5 c 0.9,. HOAc . Repeating the above, substituting other acids for acetic acid during the equilibration of the resin, there may be obtained, for example, the corresponding salts with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, benzoic acid, and the like. Similarly there may be prepared the acid addition salts of other compounds of Formula I. B. In the case of salts of low water solubility, these may be prepared by precipitation from water utilizing the desired acid. For example Zinc tannate salt a solution of 10 mg of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 acetic acid salt in 0.1 mL of water was treated with a solution of 8 mg of tannic acid in 0.08 mL of 0.25 MNaOH. A solution of 5 mg of ZnSO4 heptahydrate in 0.1 mL of water was immediately added to the solution of theLH RH analogue. The resultant suspension was diluted with 1 mL water and the precipitate was centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted and the residue was washed twice with 1 mL portions of water by centrifugation of the precipitate and decantation of the supernatant. The precipitate was dried in vacuo to yield 15 mg of the mixed zinc tannate salt of the above named LH RH analogue. Pamoate salt to a solution of 50 mg pyro Glu HisTrp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 acetic acid salt in a mixture of 1.6 mL of ethanol and 0.1 mL of 0.25 M NaOH was added solution of 11 mg of pamoic acid in 0.3 mL of 0.25 M NaOH. The solvents were removed at reduced pressure and the residue was suspended in 2 mL of water, centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitate was washed with 1.5 mL H2O, centrifuged, and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitate was dried in vacuo to yield 54 mg of the pamoate salt of the above named LH RH analogue. In a similar manner other salts of low water solubility may be prepared. C. Preparation of acid addition salt from free peptide. To a solution of 50 mg of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr3 2 naphthyl D Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 as the free base is added 30 mL of 1N acetic acid. The resulting solution is lyophilized to yield 50 mg. of the acetic acid salt of the above named LH RH analogue. Similarly, replacing acetic acid with other acids in stoichiometrically equivalent amounts relative to peptide there was obtained other acid additon salts of compounds of Formula I , for example, the salts with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid. D. Preparation of salt with metal cation, e.g., zinc salt To a solution of 50 mg pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 acetic acid salt in a mixture of 0.4 mL of 0.25 M NaOH, 0.3 mL water, and 1 mL ethanol was added a solution of 15 mg of ZnSO4 heptahydrate in 0.2 mL of water. The precipitate was centrifuged and the supernatant was decanted. The precipitate was washed with 1 mL of water by centrifugation and decantation of the supernatant. The precipitate was dried in vacuo t yield 48 mg of the zinc salt of the above named LH RH analogue. In a similar manner salts with other multivalent cations e.g. calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and the like, may be prepared. Example 7 A solution of 50 mg of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D Ala Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 acetic acid salt in 25 ml of water is passed through a 50 g column ofDowex 1 strongly basic, quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin which had been equilibrated with NaOH solution to make the counter ion hydroxide. The column is eluted with 150 ml of water and the eluant is lyophilized to yield 45 mg of the corresponding polypeptide as the free base. Similarly other acid additions salts of compounds ofFormula I , e.g. those mentioned in Example 6, may be converted to the corresponding free bases. Example 8 The following are typical pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active ingredient, an LH RH analogue of the present invention, for example pyro Glu His TrpSer Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2, by itself or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g. the acetic acid addition salt, the zinc salt, the zinc tannate salt, etc.A.

LH RH Analogue 200.0 pg Lactose, USP 83.3 mg Pregelatinized Starch, USP 15.0 mg Magnesium Stearate, USP 1.5 mgMethod of Manufacture a. LH RH Analogue is dissolved in water, a sufficient quantity to form a wet granulation when mixed with the sugar portion of the excipients. After complete mixing, the granulation is dried in a tray or fluid bed dryer.The dry granulation is then screened to break up any large aggregates and then mixed with the remaining components. The granulation is then compressed on a standard tabletting machine to the specific tablet weight. b. In this manufacturing method, all formulations would include 0.01 gelatin, USP. The gelatin would be first dissolved in the aqueous granulation solvent followed by the LH RH analog. The remaining steps are as in a above. Formulation 4 could also be used as a tablet for oral administration.B. Long Acting intramuscular injectable formulation. 1. Long Acting I.M.

EXAMPLE 9 Estrus Suppression in the RatPROCEDURE Female rats Hilltop, Sprague Dawley, approximately 200 g. with open vaginas are weight grouped 5 cage and 2 cages group. The rats are injected subcutaneously, twice daily except as noted below for 14 days. Daily vaginal smears are taken to determine the stage of estrus cycle and body weights are recorded at 0, 1 and 2 weeks. The percent of females showing partial estrus suppress ion i.e. only diestrus and proestrus but no estrus from day 4 on and the percent of females showing complete estrus suppress ion i.e. only diestrus from day 4 on are recorded. EDso s are derived from the best fit straight line of the percentage data of estrus suppression. The LHRH analogues were administered as their acetate salts in physiological saline containing 0.1 , bovine serum albumin.Injection volume was 0.2 ml and the analogue was present as 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 pg. A control physiological saline containing BSA showed no estrus suppress ion. The EDso s for combined partial and complete estrus suppression are as follows Compound EDso g inj. pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl 0.08 D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl 0.22 D alanyl Leu Arg Pro NHEt pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl 0.07 D alanyl N MeLeu Arg Pro Gly NH2 pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl 0.12 D alanyl N MeLeu Arg Pro NHEt pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2,4,6 0.08 trimethylphenyl D aIgnyl leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 l naphthyl 0.3 D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 9 anthryl 0.27 D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 RTI ID 44.1 pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 4 0.28a biphenylyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 pyro G1u His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 fluorenyl 0. 40a D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH2 pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2,2 diphenyl 0.11 methyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NHEt pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2,4,6 0.35a trimethylphenyl D alanyl N MeLeu Arg Pro Gly NH2 pyro Glu His 3 1 naphthyl L alanyl 0.16 Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro NHEt a For these compounds administration was once daily. EXAMPLE 10 Six Swiss Webster mice Simonsen each weighing about 25 grams, were injected subcutaneously with 0.25 ml of an aqueous solution of pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH as its acetate salt. The dosage was 40 mg kg or about 1 mg mouse. The mice were observed twice daily for mortality for 21 days. No lethal effects were observed. The LD50 is, therefore, more than 40 mg kg.
