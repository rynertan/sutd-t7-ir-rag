# Device for displaying an analog signal on a display screen.

## Abstract
A device for displaying an analog signal on a display screen 7 which is scanned by means of a line deflection generator 21 and a frame deflection generator 23 . The device comprises a signal processing device 13 for forming a processed signal by repeating the analog signal at the line deflection frequency, a reference voltage generator 19 for generating a reference voltage which is dependent on the frame deflection voltage, and a comparator 17 for comparing the reference voltage and the processed signal and for generating a control signal which causes a brightening of the scanned display screen 7 when both signals are approximately equal. In order to improve the picture quality, the device comprises means 18 for adding a varying auxiliary signal to the processed signal. The frequency of this auxiliary signal amounts to at least ten times the line deflection frequency.
