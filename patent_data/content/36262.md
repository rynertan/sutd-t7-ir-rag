# ROOM TEMPERATURE CURABLE ORGANOPOLYSILOXANE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
A low modulus silicone rubber which cures at room temperature can be obtained by exposing a composition made from a hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosiloxane, an aminoxy silicon compound having two aminoxy groups per molecule, such as, methylvinyldi N N diethylaminoxy silane, and a hydrolyzable organosilicon compound which has at least three hydrolyzable groups per molecule including oxime, alkoxy, amino, vinyloxy, amide, imide, and lactam such as methyltri N methylacetamido silane or methyltrimethoxysilane. The compositions can be packaged in a single container and, if sealed, remain stable until exposed to moisture. The compositions can be made by a two step method comprising mixing the aminoxy silicon compound and the hydroxyl endblocked polydiorganosilox ane and thereafter blending in the hydrolyzable organosilicon compound.
