# Gaseous fuel carburetion.

## Abstract
In a gaseous fuel carburetion system in which air and gaseous fuel are mixed in a mixer prior to induction into an internal combustion engine, and in which the rate of flow of the induction air is controlled by throttiing the intake of the air fuel mixture, and in which gaseous fuel is supplied to the system from a pressurized source, an improved method and apparatus for regulating the supply of gaseous fuel to the air fuel mixer is provided. The method comprises the steps of sensing at least one operating parameter of the engine which is a function of the induction air flow rate and generating a control signal which varies in response to changes in the induction air flow rate, controlling the rate of flow of the gaseous fuel from the source to the mixer by means of said control signal whereby the rate of flow of the gaseous fuel varies in response to the sensed changes in the parameters related to the air flow rate. The apparatus comprises mixer means arranged to receive and mix the induction air and the gaseous fuel supply and to deliver the mixture to the engine, sensing means S₁....S₃ for monitor ing at least one operating parameter of the engine which is a function of the induction air flow rate and generating a control signal which varies in response to changes in the induction air flow rate, flow control means 20 adapted to control the rate of flow of the gaseous fuel from the source to the mixer whereby the rate of flow of the gaseous fuel varies in response to the sensed changes in the parameters related to the air flow rate.
