# Adaptive inertial vehicle navigation system.

## Abstract
Vehicle navigation system provided with an adaptive inertial vehicle navigation system based on the measure ment of the speed and the lateral acceleration of the vehicle and provided with a correction unit for correcting the measured values. Navigation system for a road vehicle, comprising inter alia a route determining unit and position locating means. The route determining unit works together with a mass memory in which geographic data of a road network are stored. The route determining unit determines a driving route between a starting point and a destination which are communicated by the driver to the vehicle. The position locating devices determine the vehicle position coordinates recurrently from the speed and acceleration of the vehicle in motion as determined by a measuring unit. The navigation system is further provided with a correction unit which determines a correction vector for correcting the generated vehicle position coordinates. This correction vector is deter mined by performing a transposition of the generated vehicle position coordinates to an actual road position as repeated by coordinates of the road network which are stored in the mass memory. Also derived from the measured speed and lateral acceleration and also from the generated vehicle position coordinates is an acceleration operator, which acceleration operator operates on the correction vector in order to derive from this a correction value for the measured acceleration. The navigation system further com prises a receiver for receiving position coordinate signals originating from a navigation satellite. A Kalman filter mixes the vehicle position coordinates with the position coordin ates originating from the navigation satellite.
