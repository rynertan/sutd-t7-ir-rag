# Method of producing polymeric film like coatings.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of coating a surface of a substrate or of an article, of a material, such as glass, metal, ceramic, cloth or the like, with a colored film like polymeric coating consisting essentially of a plasma formed polymer matrix containing therein particulates with the method comprising introducing plasma polymerizable material through at least one conduit 30 into the interior region 14 of an appropriate apparatus 10 , in which region 14 there is maintained an electrical discharge conducive to plasma polymerize the introduced material and deposit it on surface concurrently with a depositing therewith of the particulates or color centers, of a size and in a distribution adapted through selective scattering and adsorption of light to provide a desired color while the substrate 20 contacts, or is, a cathode element 19 maintained at an electrical potential conducive for the depositing and while preferably the particulates are opaque and colloidal and provided by thermal evaporation employing a filament resistance heater inductively heated evaporation source means or an electron beam evaporator means.
