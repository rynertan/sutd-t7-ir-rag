## Description
DEVICE FOR POSITIONING WORKPIECES IN MACHINES ooOOoo The present invention relates to a device allowing to move cyclically a workpiece between two positions, with possibil.ity to adjust the stroke length in a continuous and autonomous manner. It can be applied in any highly productive machines, wherein the motion of the workpieces and their positioning is provided to take place with special rapidity and precision. According to a widely spread technique, the aforecited machines make use of pneumatic cylinders. Considering the nature of the pneumatic cylinder, in order to obtain a precise positioning of the workpiece moved thereby, use is normal.ly made of adjustable mechanical stops. This technique is used, with excellent results, whenever the end of stroke position of the piston once it has been adjusted at the moment of setting or testing the machine no longer has to be changed for long periods of time. It is of course possible, when the machine is designed to perform different operations, to change the position of the stops according to the type of operation. However, such changes of position, and the subsequent adjustments, involve fairly long and complicated manoeuvres, as they require mechanical operations, whereby it is unthinkable t adopt this technique when changes of operation have to be performed quite frequently, or even according to predetermined cycles. In this latter case, in replacement of the pneumatic piston, a movable slider is normally used, acting as workpiece carrier and being controlled, for instance, by a screw and nut system, operated by a direct current motor with feedback adjustment closed ring control . In fact, with motors of th.is type, the stroke of the slider is followed electronically without interruption and the stopping thereof is hence controll.ed with extreme precision. These control and operation systems have however the drawback of being far more complicated than the pneumatic cylinder system, they require highly powerful electric motors and consequently involve very high costs. Furthermore, they cause the slider to move less rapidly and they give rise to problems of wear of the screw and nut, such as to create difficulties in the long run with the precision adjustment of the slider position. The object of the present invention is therefore to solve the aforementioned problems, by supplying a device for shifting and adjusting the position of a piece, which preserves at relatively low costs the characteristics of simplicity and rapidity of the piston system and allows, furthermore, a prompt adjustment of the machine to different operations. According to the present invention, this object is obtained by means of a device for shifting and adjusting the position of a piece in operating machines, of the type making use of a pneumatic piston, the stroke of which is limited by a stop determining an exact position thereof, characterized in that the positioning of said stop is controlled by a screw and nut system driven in rotation by a motor with position control. More precisely the worm screw is parallel to the axis of said piston and the stop is fixedly connected to said screw nut, this latter being prevented from rotation and the worm screw being prevented from translation in the axial direction. The invention will now be described more in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of the device according to the present invention and Fig. 2 is a section view of the screw nut, along the line II II of figure 1. With reference to the drawings, the device according to the present invention essentially comprises a pneumatic piston cylinder unit 1 2, and of a worm screw 3, with respective screw nut 4, whose rotation axis is parallel to the axis of said piston cylinder unit 1 2. Both the cylinder 2 and the screw 3 are firmly mounted to the frame 5 of the machine. The piston 1 carries at its free end a piece 6 like a worktable or a carrier for a workpiece and is movable between a closing position in which it is completely inside the cylinder 2, and an opening position in which the piece 6 rests against the screw nut 4. The piece 6 is moreover fixed to a cylindrical bar 7, slidingslackless inside a sleeve 8. This arrangement all.ows to discharge the stresses acting on the piece 6 without this latter undergoing any warping. The worm screw 3 is mounted on the frame 5, at both ends, by means of thrust bearings 9 which prevent any displacement thereof in the axial direction but of course allowing the rotation. Said screw is driven into rotation by an electric motor M with position control. The motor M is preferably a step by step motor, by means of which the positioning of the screw nut 4 can easily be programmed in any predetermined position along the worm screw 3. According to the present invention the motor M has a low power because it has to change the position of the screw nut 4, which is very light and not as in the above cited known technique the piece 6 worktable or workpiece which may have a considerable weight. Therefore the motor M has a very reduced dimention and relatively low costs. The screw nut 4 has a pierced projection 4a allowing it to freely slide along a service bar 10, also fixedly connected to the frame 5 and parallel to the worm screw 3, in order to prevent the screw nut 4 from rotating about the screw 3 during rotation of this latter. As better shown in figure 2, the screw nut 4 is also provided with a jaw 11 which, under the action of the spring 12, provides to lock said screw nut on the threads of the screw 3 during the alternate stroking of the piston 1. On changing operation, when the screw nut 4 has to be moved to another position, the piston 1 is stopped and, before operating the motorM, the pin 13 normally kept in a rest position by the spring 14 is pneumatically operated and provides to open the jaw 11, overcoming the resistance of the spring 12. At this point, the screw nut 4 is free to slide with a minimum effort under the action of the motor M into the wanted position. The working of the heretofore described device is quite evident, and the extreme simplicity and easy use thereof appear at once clear. The jaw system 11 allows in fact to lock, in a fully reliable manner, the screw nut 4 in the wanted position, preventing even the slightest movements during a same series of operations. Between one series of operations and the next, the shifting of the screw nut 4 is obtained in a very fast and precise annex, which may eventually be planned a priori through an appropriate planning computer, acting on the feed of the step by step motor M and on the operation of the pin 13. This arrangement allows to obtain the fundamental advantage of preserving, on one side, the control of the movements of the piece 6 through pneumatic piston which is simpler in the structure and faster in the working realizing, on the other side, the precise adjustment of the piece position thanks to the automatic setting of the stop positioning, obtained through simple and economic means. It should then be noted that the present invention has allowed to solve completely also the wear problem between screw and nut which, as seen heretofore, provides considerable drawbacks in the known art. This result is obtained particularly for the fact that, when the worm screw 3 is made to rotate, the jaw 11 of the screw nut is open, and therefore the friction between screw and nut is minimum or almost null. The invention has been described with reference to a particular preferred embodiment thereof, but there may evidently be other arrangements and embodiments differing from the same and all within reach of an expert in the art particul.arly for what concerns the fitting of the device to the single machines and the system for adjustment of the same without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention.
