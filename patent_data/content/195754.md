# IMPROVEMENTS TO APPARATUSES FOR AUTOMATIC FOCUSING OF LENS SYSTEMS, IN PARTICULAR MICROSCOPES AND INSTRUMENTS FOR ACQUISITION OF MICROSCOPE IMAGES

## Abstract
An improved apparatus for the automatic focusing of a lens system comprising a space dissector 17 for analysing the space frequency components of the image close to the ideal focus plane, having devices 53, 57 for detecting the plane, and the position of this plane, comprising the maximum of space frequencies close to the ideal focus plane. An electronical device is provided for obtaining suitable signal from said space dissector 17 to provide an adjustement control signal actuating a servo control unit controlling the lens focusing for leading the image plane comprising the maximum of high frequency components in coincidence with said ideal focus plane.
