## Description
WATER REDUCIBLE COATING COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to an aqueous dispersion of a tertiary amine terminated polyether and a carboxylic acid functional polymer, a process for producing the same and coating compositions based on the aqueous dispersion of polymer. The coating compositions of this invention are inter alia useful for lining metal containers for food, beer and other beverages. Epoxy resins are generally regarded as providing an excellent combination of properties offering good adhesion, flexibility and resistance to solvent and chemical attack. There is an increasing demand, worldwide, for low V.O.C. water reducible coating compositions to replace solvent based systems. FV.O.C. is the weight of organic solvent per unit volume of solid coating, expressed in grams per litre . Epoxy resins are hydrophobic in nature. Consequently, many attempts have been made to modify epoxy resins to make them water dispersible without loss of their desirable properties. These approaches have met with varying degrees of success. For example, EP 6334, EP 116225 and related patents teach the grafting of an epoxy resin to a hydrophilic acrylic polymer containing carboxyl groups, by reaction between the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin and the carboxylic acid groups of the acrylic polymer. Thus the bonds linking the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of the copolymer are ester bonds. This approach has the disadvantage that, in a water based coating composition, the ester bonds tend to hydrolyse, resulting in poor storage stability. British Patent Nos. 1,585,486 and 1,585,487 teach the approach of growing a hydrophilic acrylic polymer containing carboxyl groups by free radical addition polymerisation, in the presence of a modified epoxy resin. The key to this approach is in the use of relatively high levels of a free radical initiator which has high hydrogen abstraction power principally benzoyl peroxide this leads to the grafting of the acrylic polymer to the epoxy resin by chain transfer.This approach has the disadvantage that the level of grafting is relatively low. Furthermore, the water based coating composition made by this approach has a relatively high viscosity for a given solids. Yet a different approach is taught byU.S. 4,247,439, WO 83 03613 and related patents. These patents teach the reaction of the residual epoxide groups of an epoxy resin with a tertiary amine, in the presence of water, to form a quaternary amine hydroxide terminated polyether. The product of this reaction is dispersed in water by incorporating a blend of carboxylic acid functional polymers. This approach has the great disadvantage that it is cumbersome, and hence expensive, in that there are a relatively large number of intermediate products that go to make up the final product. According to the present invention there is provided an aqueous dispersion of a tertiary amine terminated polyether and a carboxylic acid functional polymer wherein the tertiary amine terminated polyether is the product of the reaction of the epoxy group of an epoxy resin with the hydroxy group of a hydroxy functional tertiary amine and the carboxylic acid functional polymer is present in an amount sufficient to render the combination water dispersible. The invention also provides a process for producing this aqueous dispersion which comprises a reacting the epoxide groups of an epoxy resin with a hydroxy functional tertiary amine to form a tertiary amine terminated polyether, and b dispersing the tertiary amine terminated polyether in water with the aid of a carboxylic acid functional polymer in an amount sufficient to render the combination dispersible. There is further provided a coating composition comprising a stable dispersion in water of i a tertiary amine terminated polyether which is in ionic association with ii a polymer derived, at least in part, from carboxylic acid functional monomers, and iii a crosslinking agent. It will be appreciated that, in practice, some unassociated polymer of type i and or type ii may also be present in the composition. An ionically associated polymer complex is thought to result from an acid base relationship between the amine terminated polyether and the carboxylic acid containing polymer. The amine terminated polyether is formed by reacting the 1,2 epoxide group of an epoxy resin with the hydroxy group of a hydroxy functional tertiary amine e.g. N,N dimethyl ethanolamine . Optionally the coating may also contain zinc oxide or other pigmentation, depending on the final application. An advantage of this product is that it allows considerable flexibility in formulating coating compositions with desired solids viscosity relationships. Typical examples would be 45 solids at a viscosity of 26 sec. Ford No.4 Cup at 250C, and 17 1 2 solids at a viscosity of 21 sec. Ford No. 4Cup. In the simplest approach to making the amine terminated polyether used in the present invention, a low molecular weight epoxy resin e.g. DER343 is reacted with Bisphenol A in a suitable organic solvent. The hydroxy functional tertiary amine is added to the resultant epoxy resin and the reaction mixture is held at ca 100 C for about 1 hour. Examples of suitable hydroxy functional tertiary amines areN,N dimethylethanolamine DMEA , N,N diethylethanolamine DEEA , 2 dimethylamino 2 methyl propanol DMAMP and triethanolamine. During the course of the reaction, the tertiary amine group of the hydroxy functional amine catalyses the reaction of the hydroxy group with the residual epoxide groups of the epoxy resin, according to the reaction scheme below EMI4.1 tb SEP t SEP oRt tb CHCC SEP SEP R3Nss SEP d SEP R, N tb SEP L SEP yaed tb epoxy reslz trdroEr functional rains terminated tertiary amine polyether Where, in the case of DMEA, R1 and R2 are methyl groups and R3 is CH2 CH2 . It must be borne in mind that the presence of a hydroxy functional solvent e.g. butanol or butyl cellosolve will reduce the yield of the tertiary amine terminating groups by competing with the hydroxyl groups of the tertiary amine.If significant amounts of water are present, the undesirable quaternary amine hydroxide will be formed. Thus preferred results are achieved when the reaction is carried out under anhydrous conditions. In order to confirm the reaction products stated above, we carried out experiments in which, in order to facilitate analysis, we maximised the number of 1,2 epoxide groups available for reaction. EXPERIMENT 1 REACTION OF DMEA WITH EPOXIDE GROUPS Dry propylene oxide, 146.6g, and dry DMEA 224.9g water content less than 0.05 were mixed together in a round bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, a stirrer and a reflux condenser. The reaction mixture was heated to 40 C whereupon it exothermed to 90 0C before the temperature began to fall. Excess reactants were distilled off using a rotary evaporator. Analysis of the product by NMR and GPC showed that, despite some polymerisation, the reaction product was predominantly that shown below EMI5.1 EXPERIMENT 2 REACTION OF DRY DMEA WITH THE DIGLYCIDYL ETHER OF BISPHENOL A Dry DER331 17g, and dry DMEA 211g were mixed together in a 500 ml round bottomed flask fitted with a condenser, a thermometer, a stirrer and temperature controller, heated to 105 0C and held at that temperature for 1 hour. Excess DMEA was removed from the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator.Analysis by NMR showed that a considerable amount of the product obtained was due to the reaction of the hydroxyl group of DMEA with the epoxide group ofDER331. Further evidence for the tertiary amine terminated product was that it was soluble in water only at low pH. EXPERIMENT 3 REACTION OF DMEA WITH THE DIGLYCIDYL ETHER OF BISPHENOL A IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER DER331 2.2g, DMEA 10.7g, water 208g, and dimethyl formamide 283g were mixed together in a roundbottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a stirrer and a thermometer and heated to reflux 106 0C . The mixture was maintained at reflux for 6 hours. The product was purified using a rotary evaporator.Analysis of the product was consistent with it being quaternary amine salt. Furthermore, the product was water soluble under neutral,acidic and basic conditions. In the product of this invention the tertiary amine terminated polyether is dispersed in water with the aid of a carboxylic acid functional polymer. The number of carboxylic acid groups in the carboxylic acid functional polymer in a given amount of product needs to be sufficient to form an effective ionic association with the amine terminated polyether and for a stable dispersion in water to be formed. If the carboxylic acid functional polymer is a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated acid, such as acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, and hydrophilic co monomers such as 2 hydroxy propyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxy ethyl acrylate, or acrylamide, then the number of acid groups on the carboxylic acid functional polymer in a given amount of product may be less than the number of tertiary amine groups on the polyether in that same amount of product.If, however, the carboxylic acid functional polymer is a copolymer of an ethylenically unsaturated acid and more hydrophobic monomers such as styrene or butyl acrylate, then a larger proportion of acid groups is required than if hydrophilic co monomers are used. Our experience with this type of system reveals that the final viscosity of the coating composition, at a given amount of solids, is governed by i The spacing of the carboxylic acid groups in the carboxylic acid functional polymer. The more the acid groups are spaced by other monomers, at a given total number of carboxylic groups, the lower the viscosity.ii The VOC the lower the VOC, the lower the viscosity.iii The degree of neutralisation of the carboxylic acid groups the lower the degree of neutralisation, the lower the viscosity. It is always necessary, however, to ensure a suitable degree of neutralisation to provide a stable dispersion.iv The ratio of carboxylic acid functional polymer to the tertiary amine terminated polyether. The higher the ratio of carboxylic acid functional polymer, the higher the viscosity.v The molecular weight of the carboxylic acid functional polymer the higher the molecular weight, the higher the viscosity. As mentioned above, the role of the solvent can be important in determining the properties of the final coating composition. If the degree of ionic association between the polyether and the polycarboxylic acid functional polymer is too great, the polymer blend will gell and it will no longer be possible to disperse it in water. The degree of ionic association is controlled by controlling the amine value of the polyether more specifically by minimising the number of molecules which have tertiary amine groups on both ends. This can be achieved by, in the first instance, minimising the number of modified epoxy resin molecules with 1,2 epoxide groups on each end, and in the second instance, by reacting some of these groups with hydroxy functional solvents, such as butyl cellosolve or butanol.Obviously, if the amine termination reaction is carried out in the presence of an hydroxy functional solvent, the extent of amine termination would be reduced because the tertiary amine would be expected to catalyse the reaction of the solvent hydroxyl groups with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin.

The carboxylic acid functional polymer used was prepared as follows. 840g acrylic acid, 767g styrene, lig benzoyl peroxide and 3055g butyl cellosolve were added to a 5 litre five necked, flange topped ,round bottomed flask fitted with a condenser, a stirrer and a thermometer, stirred until ac had dissolved, and heated to 800C. The heating was then turned off, the exotherm was allowed to take the temperature to reflux after which the temperature started to drop. When the temperature had dropped to 130 C, the heating was turned on and 273g solvent distilled off. The resulting polyelectrolyte had an NVM of 35 . When a sample was diluted with an equal weight of butyl cellosolve,it had a Gardner Holdt viscosity of W at 25 0C. 2. aa and bb were mixed well in a 750 ml flask at 7O0C. 3. cc was added with constant stirring.4. dd was added over 30 mins. The dispersion was stable and had a viscosity of 180 sec. Ford Cup No.4 at 250C at 46 solids.
