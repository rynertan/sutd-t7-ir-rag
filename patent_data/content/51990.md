## Description
BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE HETEROBICYCLICHYDROXIMIDATES AND THIOLHYDROXIMIDATESAND CARBAMATE ESTER DERIVATIVES THEREOFEMI1.1 BACKGROUND OF TIIE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to biologically active hydroximidates, thiolhydroximidates, amidoximes and, more particularly, to novel pesticidally active carbamate and sulfenylated carbamate derivatives thereof. Carbamate derivatives of hydroximidates and thiolhydroximidates have heretofore been previously described. For example, U.S. Patent No.3,576,834 discloses acyclic compounds of the structureEMI1.2 wherein Q is sulfur or oxygen and the insecticidal and acaricidal activity thereof. Similarly, carbamates of monocyclic thiolhydroximidates of the structure EMI2.1 are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,317,562 as insecticides. Carbamate derivatives of bicyclic oximes have been previously reported. U.S. Patent No. 3,231,599 discloses compounds of the structureEMI2.2 as insecticidally active compounds. Further, Belgian Patent No. 766109 reports quinuclidine oxime carbamates of the structureEMI2.3 also with reported insecticidal activity. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,317,562 and 3,574,233 further disclose thiabicycloalkanes and cenes of the formulasEMI2.4 The patentees indicate that compounds of the above formulas possess insecticidal, fungicidal, nematicidal, antibacterial and herbicidal activity. It will be appreciated that the foregoing thiabicycloalkanes and alkenes are not carbamates. U.S. Patent No. 4,219,658 discloses lactones and thiolactones of the formulasEMI3.1 as intermediates in the preparation of hydrocarbylthiomethyl 2,2 dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acids useful as pesticides. It has now been surprisingly found, in accordance with the present invention, that substituted heterobicyclic compounds of the formula I EMI3.2 as defined hereinafter possess a broad range of useful biological properties, as well as a high degree of activity as arthropodicides, i.e., insecticides, acaricides, aphicides, etc., as well as nematicides. As detailed hereinbelow, the compounds of the above formula I are chemically and biologically distinguishable from the acyclic and monocyclic hydroximidates and thiolhydroximidates, bicyclic oximes and thiabicyclo alkanes and alkenes described above in reference to heretofore suggested compounds by reason of the mode of action, type of action and level of action demonstrated for the compounds of the present invention, as well as the fact that the compounds of the present invention are not obtainable by previously suggested synthesis methods employed to prepare the prior art compounds which appear to be structurally similar. Certain of the compounds of the present invention are derived fromDiels Alder adducts of thiocarbonyl compounds with cyclic dienes. The ability of carbon sulfur double bonds to serve as dienophiles in the Diels Alder reaction was first reported in 1965 by Middleton J. Org. Chem. 30, 1390 1965 who described the reactions of perfluorinated thioketones, thiophosgene and thic carbonyl fluoride with several dienes, including cyclopentadiene, e.g., EMI4.1 Since that time, many other examples of such reactions have been reported, including in addition to the above dienophiles such thiocarbonyl compounds as NCC S SCH3 Can. J.Chem. 49, 3755 1971 , NCC S NR1R2 Tetrahedron Letters, 2139 1977 3 RSO2C S SR tTetrahedron 30, 2735 1974 , andEMI4.2 t. Org. Chem. 45, 3713 1980 A limited number of reports have appeared on further reactions of the initial Diels Alder adducts. Johnson et al. J. Org. Chem. 34, 860 1969 3 describe oxygenation of the sulfur, followed by epoxidation of the double bond as depicted below EMI4.3 The authors indicate that one chlorine can be reduced from the dichloro sulfone by treatment with divalent chromium EMI4.4 Reduction with lithium aluminum hydride yields the bicyclic thioalkene EMI4.5 In 1973, Reich et al. J. Org.Chem. 38, 2637 1973 reported the reaction of thiophosgene with cyclohexadienes, to yield 3,3 dichloro 2 thiabicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 enes, as well as the hydrolysis of these Diels Alder adducts to the corresponding thiolactones. EMI5.1 Benassi et al. Synthesis 735 1974 1 describe a similar hydrolysis in the 2.2.1 system during reduction using an aqueous workup procedure EMI5.2 Raasch J. Or Chem. 40, 161 1975 reports on the addition of halogen or sulfenyl halides to the carbon carbon double bond of the 2 thiabicyclo 2.2.1 hept5 enes with rearrangement to yield the 6,7 disubstituted thiabicyclo 2.2.1 heptanes, e.g.,EMI5.3 In 1976, Allgeier et al. Tetrahedron Letters, 215 1976 also described the reaction of thiophosgene with anthracene to give the Diels Alder adduct which is subsequently hydrolyzed to the thiolactone.Hong Dissertation AbstractsInternational 40, 5672 B 1980 states that solvolysis with methanol of the DielsAlder adduct from thiophosgene and cyclopentadiene results in ring opening to yield XIV in almost quantitative yield.EMI5.4 For purposes of indexing, Chemical Abstracts classifies compounds of type X above as 2 thiabicyclo 2.2.2 oct 5 en 3 ones. In referring to these compounds, it is important to distinguish nomenclature used for indexing convenience from nomenclature signifying chemical type. Thus, ChemicalAbstracts refers to both compounds XV and XVI shown below as thiabicycloalkanones. Chemically, however, compound XV is a thiolactone, i.e., a cyclic thiolester whereas compound XVI J. Org. Chem. 43, 4013 1978 3 is a true ketone and specifically a, thioketone. EMI6.1 Esters and ketones are distinct chemical classes with many distinctly different properties. One of these distinctions is their reactivity with hydroxylamine. Ketones are known to react readily with hydroxylamine to form oxijiles EMI6.2 Esters or thiolesters and their cyclic counterparts, lactones and thiolactones do not react with hydroxylamine to yield the analogous hydroximidates or thiolhydroximidates.EMI6.3 Instead they react with cleavage of the carbon oxygen or carbon sulfur single bond to yield as displacement products, the hydroxamic acid or, in the case of the lactones and thiolactones, a lactam Advanced Organic Chemistry, SecondEdition, Jerry March, McGraw Hill Book Company, New York, 1977, p. 386, 388 .EMI6.4 An example of the failure of thiolactones to react with hydroxylamine to yield thiolhydroximidates is reported by Bruice and Fedor J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 4886 1964 . The authors confirm that thiolactones, e.g., thiolbutyrolactone, undergo hydroxylaminolysis in a manner analogous to their thiolester acyclic counterparts. The hydroximidates and thiolhydroximidates, i.e.,EMI7.1 have been reported in the literature. At least four methods of preparation have been described. U.S. Patent No. 3,576,834 and the references therein describes two of these 1 the reaction of an iminoether hydrochloride with hydroxylamine and 2 chlorination of an aldoxime to form a hydroxamoyl chloride followed by reaction of the latter with a salt of a mercaptan EMI7.2 U.S. Patent No. 3,787,470 reports the formation of thiolhydroxamate esters from nftroalkanes and alkyl mercaptans EMI7.3 Faust et al. Journal fuer Praktische Chemie, Leipzig, 31l 1 , 61, 1969 describe the conversion of a thiopyranthione to a cyclic thiolhydroximidate. EMI7.4 It will be seen from the foregoing that applicants have discovered that the Diels Alder adducts of certain thiocarbonyl compounds with cyclic dienes are converted easily and in high yield to bicyclic thiolhydroximidates which not only possess significant biological activity but which are valuable as intermediates in the synthesis of carbamate and sulfenylated carbamate final products. Moreover, the outstanding arthropodicidal and nematicidal activity exhibited by these compounds is entirely unexpected in light of the prior art set forth hereinabove which relates to the ease of hydrolysis of the thiophosgene adducts, along with the reported inability of the thiolactones thus formed to react with hydroxylamine to yield compounds of the subject invention. In addition to the above observations relative to the absence of prior art synthesis methods which would allow one to predictably obtain the compounds of the present invention by analogy, it is likewise important to note the material differences in biological activity observed with the compounds of the present invention compared to that of the seemingly related prior art compounds described hereinabove. In making such comparisons, it is again important to distinguish between nomenclature used for indexing convenience and nomenclature signifying actual chemical type. For example, for indexing purposes,Chemical Abstracts would describe the compounds of the present invention, as well as those of formulas XXI XXIII as carbamates of bicycloalkanone oximes.However, in reality, the compounds of formulas XXi XXrn are derivatives of true oximes whereas, the compounds of the present invention are derivatives of hydroximidates or thiolhydroximidates. The significance of the foregoing distinction is readily apparent when one considers the work of Huhtanen andDorough Pesticide Biochemistrv and Physiology 6, 571 1976 whd have shown that the chemical difference between the ketoxime derivative XXIV and the thiolhydroximidate derivative XXVEMI8.1 results in surprisingly marked differences in their biological activity. Although both XXIV and XXV are insecticides, their spectrum of activity, persistence, use pattern and method of application are totally different.It is evident that these documented differences result from the difference in chemical structure between a true ketoxime and a thiolhydroximidate. It will also be appreciated that a similar distinction between the compounds of the present invention and compounds of formulas xXI XXm prevails.. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to afford novel substituted heterobicyclic compounds which possess outstanding pesticidal activity. It is a further object of the present invention to provide novel processes for preparing heterobicyclic hydroximidate, thiolhydroximidate and carbamate compounds. A still further object of the present invention is to provide arthropodicidally and nematicidally active compositions and methods for controlling undesired pests by the application of the novel compounds and pesticidal compositions of the invention to their habitat, food supply or breeding sites. Still another object of the present invention is to provide novel heterobicyclic hydroximidates, thiolhydroximidates, and amidoximes which display arthropodicidal, nematicidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, plant growth regulant and anthelmintic activities, as well as being useful as novel intermediates for the preparation of carbamate and sulfenylated carbamate product derivatives. These and other similar objects, advantages and features are accomplished according to the products, compositions and methods of the invention comprised of novel substituted heterobicyclic compounds, compositions derived therefrom and pesticidal methods employing same.

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the present invention may be prepared in various salt forms and, as used herein, the expression pesticidally acceptable salts is intended to include those salts capable of being formed with the instant compounds and substituted derivatives thereof in accordance with the invention without materially altering the chemical structure or pesticidal activity of the parent compounds. For example, alkali metal salts of carboxylic acid derivatives of the invention may be obtained by reaction with suitable bases, e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. Likewise, alkaline earth metal salts may be similarly obtained. Similarly, quaternary salts of the amino derivatives of the invention may also be obtained, as well as acid addition salts, where necessary to, for instance, alter solubility properties. It will be understood that in the structural formula depicting the compounds of the present invention all unsubstituted bonds are satisfied by hydrogen. It will further be apparent to those skilled in the art that the compounds of the present invention may exist in two geometric forms, the E andZ isomers i.e., syn and anti isomers around the carbon nitrogen double bond. Both isomeric forms and their mixtures are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. The hydroximino derivatives of the present invention, i.e., compounds of formula I where Y hydrogen, are prepared according to the following methods. Hydroximidate oxabicyclo compounds of the invention can be obtained, for example, by reaction of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate with appropriately substituted cyclic dienes to form N chlorosulfonyl lactams which readily rearrange to the N chlorosulfonyl imino oxabicyclic intermediate via cycliza tion through oxygen . See J. Org. Chem. 41, 3583 1976 1, and J. Chem. Soc.Perkin I, 874 1977 and the references cited therein. The thus obtained iminooxabicyclic intermediate is then reacted with hydroxylamine to yield the desired hydroximidate. The foregoing general reaction scheme is set forth below with substituent representations corresponding to those in formula I . It will be recognized that, while the following scheme illustrates the formation of a compound of the present invention having a 2.2.11 bicyclic ring system, the above generally described process is followed to obtain compounds of the present invention having, for example, a 3.2.1 , 4.2.1 , etc., bicyclic ring system.The specific bicyclic ring system obtained will, of course, be determined by the selection of the appropriate reactants e.g., employing a cyclohexadiene reactant in place of the cyclopentadiene reactant below .EMI16.1 As alluded to previously, the bicyclic thiolhydroximidates of the present invention are obtained by a Diels Alder reaction of certain thiocarbonyl compounds with appropriately substituted cyclic dienes under suitable cyclization conditions to obtain the initial adducts which are then reacted with hydroxylamine to afford the desired intermediates. The foregoing general reaction scheme is depicted below with substituent representations corresponding to those set forth previously in formula I EMI17.1 The bicyclic azahydroximidates of the present invention are prepared in a similar manner to the preparation of the oxa and thiolhydroximidates previously described. More specifically, the appropriate 3 tosyl 2 azabicyclo intermediate prepared by the procedure of J.Organic Chemistry 39, 564 1974 1 is treated with hydroxylamine to give the desired bicyclic azahydroximidate.Alternatively, conversion of the appropriate lactam to the corresponding thionolactam followed by treatment with hydroxylamine will also afford the desired azahydroximidate. The specific reactants, procedures and conditions are further illustrated in the examples. The hydroximino intermediates can then be converted to the various carbamate derivatives embraced by formula I by any of several conventional methods. One preferred method involves the reaction of an isocyanate substituted with groups corresponding to R9 or Rlo of formula I with the particular hydroximino intermediate. The hydroximino intermediate and isocyanate are reacted in an inert organic solvent at from about 00 C to about 1500 C, preferably from about 200 C to about 800 C, and at a pressure from about 1 to 10 atmospheres, usually about 1 to about 3 atmospheres. Reaction pressures will be determined by reaction temperature, concentration and vapor pressure of the isocyanate. Any inert organic solvent used in the reaction should not contain hydroxy, amino or other groups which will react with the isocyanate function.Useful inert solvents include aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., hexane, heptane, octane, benzene, xylene ethers such as diethyl ether, ethylpropyl ether, etc. esters such as ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and various chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, perchloroethylene and the like. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of from about 0.1 to about 1.0 percent by weight, based on the weight of reactants, of a tertiary amine catalyst such as triethylamine, N,N dimethylaniline or the like. The molar ratio of isocyanate to hydroximino reactant can vary from about 0.1 1 to about 10 1. An equimolar amount or slight excess of isocyanate is preferred to insure complete reaction. Reaction times may also vary from a few minutes to several days with a usual reaction time of from about 1 2 to about 6 hours. Another method for preparing such carbamate derivatives involves reaction of the hydroximino compound with phosgene to obtain the chloroformate which is reacted with an amine. A solution of the hydroximino derivative is generally dissolved in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether which is added slowly to a solution of phosgene dissolved in inert solvent in the presence of an HC1 acceptor such as a tertiary amine. Reaction temperatures vary from about 300 C to about 1000 C with usual temperatures of from about 00 C to about 500 C, The resulting reaction mixture, a solution of the chloroformate in an inert organic solvent can be filtered to remove amine hydrochloride before reaction with an amine in step 2 of the reaction.The amine is added to the chloroformate solution in the presence of a suitable amine solvent such as water, at temperatures between about 40 C to about 800 C. A larger than molar excess of amine can be used so that the amine acts both as a reactant and as an HCl acceptor and complete conversion of chloroformate is obtained.Alternatively, a separate HCl acceptor, such as a tertiary amine can be used. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the carbamate derivatives of the present invention can be prepared by reaction of Nprotected hydroxylamine with an appropriately substituted carbamylating agent, e.g.,EMI18.1 as defined before, deprotection of the resulting intermediate and reaction of the deprotected intermediate with, for example, the initial Diels Alder adduct to obtain the products of formula I . The sulfenylated carbamates of the invention may be prepared from the carbamates and carbamate precursors obtained in accordance with the foregoing description by methods described, for example, in AngewandteChemie, International Edition, 16, 735 1977 and the references referred to therein, J. Org. Chem. 43, 3953 1978 , J. Agric. Food Chem. 26, 550 1978 , U.S.Patent Nos. 4,201,733, 4,148,910, 4,138,423 and 4,108,991. Essentially, two methods have previously been employed for the preparation of such derivatives. In the first of these, an N alkyl carbamate is allowed to react with a sulfenyl halide to yield the sulfenylated carbamate in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI19.1 In the second method, the sulfenyl halide is allowed to react with anN alkyl carbamyl halide to yield an intermediate N alkyl N substituted thio carbamyl halide which is then treated with the desired hydroxylic moiety to provide the carbamate.EMI19.2 In each of the foregoing reactions, where HX or HY are generated, an acid acceptor is utilized to facilitate the reaction. The foregoing sulfenylation reactions are normally conducted in an aprotic organic solvent. Illustrative of aprotic organic solvents which are suitable as reaction solvents in accordance with the present invention are those previously mentioned for use in connection with the preparation of the carbamate derivatives of the invention. The acid acceptor utilized in carrying out the sulfenylation reaction may be either an organic or inorganic base. Organic bases useful as acid acceptors are tertiary amines, alkali metal alkoxides and the like. Bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and the like are illustrative of inorganic bases suitable for use in the conduct of this reaction. Preferred acid acceptors are aromatic and aliphatic tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, pyridine, trimethylamine, 1,4 diazobicycloE2.2.21 octane and the like. When an inorganic base is used as the acid acceptor, phase transfer agents may be used to facilitate the transfer of the acid acceptor across the organic inorganic phase interface. As useful phase transfer agents, there may be mentioned crown ether compounds, quaternary ammonium halide compounds and the like. In these reactions, the reaction temperature may be varied between about 300 C to approximately 1300 C, preferably between Oc C to about 750 C. The sulfenylation reactions can be conducted at either subatmospheric, atmospheric or superatmospheric pressures, but conventionally are conducted at atmospheric or autogenous pressure. Reactants, intermediates or precursor compounds necessary in carrying out the reactions set forth herein are readily obtainable following conventional synthetic methods. For instance, N methylcarbamyl fluoride maybe prepared in accordance with the procedure detailed in J. Org. Chem. 43, 3953 1978 as may N N,N dialkylaminosulfenyl N methylcarbamyl fluoride. N N alkyl N arylsulfonyi aminosulfenyU N m ethylcarbamyl fluoride is prepared according to the methods set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,148,910.

Found C, 41.9 H, 4.2 N, 12.1 S, 27.8.EXAMPLE 296 2 Azabicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 en 3 one oxime To a solution of hydroxylamine from 2.1 g 0.03 m of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 4.3 g 0.015 m of sodium carbonate, 10 ml of water and 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran at 0 C was added 5.16 g 0.021 m of 3 tosyl 2 azabicyclo 2.2.1 hepta 2,5 diene prepared by the procedure of J. OrganicChemistry, 39, 564 1974 in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran. After being stirred overnight, during which time the temperature was allowed to warm to 250 C, the organic layer was separated dried, and stripped of solvent. Purification of the residue by chromatography silica gel zdichloromethane ethyl acetate gave 0.8 g of material whose spectra were consistent with the title structure. EXAMPLE 297 2 Methyl 2 azabicyclo 2.2.21 octan 3 one oxime A slurry of 33.0 g 0.218 m of 4 methylamino benzoic acid and 4.0 g of 5 rhodium on alumina catalyst in 350 ml of water was shaken under 1500 psig of hydrogen for 24 hours. The insolubles were removed by filtration. The slurry from partial removal of water under reduced pressure was diluted with 300 ml ofN,N dimethylformamide and chilled. The precipitated solid was filtered, washed with several portions of cold acetone, and dried to yield 23 g 75 of 4 methylamino cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. The crude acid in 200 ml of diphenyl ether was heated at 230 2500 C for 20 minutes with removal of water. Removal of the diphenylether under reduced pressure gave 10.6 g 52 of 2 methyl 2 azabicyclo 2.2.2 octan 3 one. A solution of this in 100 ml of toluene was added to a mixture of 28.3 g 0.07 m of 4 methoxyphenylthionophosphine sulfide in 100 ml of toluene. After 3 hours under reflux, the cooled mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The oily residue was purified by column chromatography silica gel 3 l ether petroleum ether to yield 8.8 g of 2 methyl 2 azabicycl0 2.2.2 octan3 thione. A solution of the thione in 50 ml of acetone was added to 80.9 g 0.57 m of methyl iodide under nitrogen at room temperature. After being stirred overnight, the mixture was chilled and filtered under nitrogen to give 10.6 g of solid. A partial solution of this solid in 75 ml of chloroform was added dropwise to a stirred solution of hydroxylamine from 5 g 0.072 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 15.5 g 0.054 m of hydrated sodium carbonate, 10 ml of water, and 150 ml of chloroform at 0 C. After 6 hours, during which the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, the organic phase was separated, dried and stripped to yield 4.4 g of residue whose spectra were consistent with the title structure. The following compounds were prepared using the foregoing synthesis procedures with appropriate selection of substituted dienes, dienophiles and carbamylating agents to obtain the derivatives of formula I set forth in Tables 1 VI.

corn rootworm Diabrotiea und ecimpunctata howardi , Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis , Southern armyworm Spodoptera eridania , housefly Musca domestica , bean aphid Aphis fabae and red spider mite Tetranychus urticae . A combination of contact, stomach poison and systemic tests are run on these insects. The formulation used for insecticide testing contains a final concentration of 0.0128 percent or 128 p.p.m. test chemical, 4 percent acetone and 0.01 percent 100 p.p.m. Triton X 155 surfactant. Accompanying reference insecticides, if any, are formulated by these procedures as are the checks which contain a standard amount of solvent and a surfactant, but no test chemical.The foregoing stock formulations are utilized with appropriate dilution to obtain the desired pound acre application rates. The test procedures employed are as follows. BEAN APHID SPRAY AND SYSTEMIC TEST This test determines the insecticidal activity of the compound being tested against the bean aphid, Aphis fabae. Stock formulations containing 128 p.p.m. of each test chemical are prepared using 12.8 mg of the test chemical, 4.0 ml acetone containing 0.25 percent V V Triton X 155 and 96.0 ml deionized water and are used in both soil drench and spray treatments. The stock formulations are diluted to obtain the appropriate lower concentrations main taming the concentration level of all adjuvants. The bean aphid is cultured on nasturtium plants var. Tall Single , no attempt being made to select insects of a given age in these tests. Single nasturtium test plants growing in soil in individual 3 inch fiber pots are then infested with populations of 100 to 200 aphids. In the spray application, 50 ml of stock or diluted formulation is uniformly sprayed onto the plants. In the systemic application, all.2 ml of stock or diluted formulation is applied to the soil containing the plant. A dosage of 11.2 ml of formulation containing 128 p.p.m. of test chemical is equivalent to a dosage of the test chemical of 4 pounds per acre lb A . The plant test units under fluorescent lights are given bottom watering for the duration of the test. Percentage mortality is determined three days after treatment. Results of this test, as expressed in LC50 values, are shown in Table VII as A aphid contact spray and AS aphid systemic soil drench . RED SPIDER MITE SPRAY AND SYSTEMIC TEST This test determines the acaricidal activity of the compound being tested against the red spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Stock formulations containing 128 p.p.m. of each test chemical are prepared by the procedure above and are used in both the soil drench and spray treatments. The stock culture of mites is maintained on Scarlet runner bean foliage. Approximately 18 to 24 hours before testing, mites are transferred to the primary leaves of a Lima bean plant var. Sieva grown in 3 inch pots. The spray and systemic application methods described before are used to apply the test formulations to the infested plants and soil. After three days, one of the two leaves treated is examined and mortality is determined.Results of this test, as expressed in LC50 values, are shown in Table VII as M mite contact spray test and MS mite systemic soil drench test . HOUSEFLY SPRAY TEST This test determines the insecticidal activity of the compound being tested against adult houseflies, Musca domestica. Stock formulations containing 128 p.p.m. of each test chemical are prepared using the procedure described previously and are diluted to obtain the appropiate lower concentrations. Ten adult flies are placed in a cylindrical screen cage 11 2 by 4 inches fabricated from 20 mesh stainless steel screening and are sprayed with 50 ml of the stock or diluted formulation. The flies are supplied food and drink from a sucrose solution by draping a paper wick over the outside of the screen cylinder and are able to feed and drink ad libitum. Percent mortality obtained is determined three days after treatment. Results of this test, as expressed in LC50 values, are shown in Table VII as HF housefly spray test . SOUTHERN ARMYWORM LEAF SPRAY TEST Paired fully expanded primary leaves excised from Scarlet runner bean plants are maintained in plastic tubes containing water and sprayed with the test formulation prepared as described previously. After the spray deposit on the leaves is dry, the paired leaves are separated. One leaf is placed onto 1.5 percent water agar and infested with 10 newly hatched Southern armyworm larvae. The covered test receptacle is held at 720 F for four days and then the percent mortality is determined. Results of this test, as expressed in LC50 values, are shown in Table VII as AW Southern armyworm spray test . MEXICAN BEAN BEETLE LEAF SPRAY TEST This test determines the insecticidal activity of the compound being tested against the Mexican bean beetle, Epilachna varivestis. The test procedure is the same as that described for the Southern armyworm with the exception that one day old larvae of the Mexican bean beetle instead of newly hatched Southern armyworm larvae are used. These tests are held at 720 F for four days when mortality and feeding inhibition are determined. The feeding inhibition is an indication of the repellent properties of the test material. Results of this test, as expressed inLC50 values, are shown in Table VII as BB Mexican bean beetle leaf spray test .

SEP As SEP SEP aphid SEP systemic tb ROOT KNOT NEMATODE TEST This test is an evaluation of the effectiveness of the compound being tested against infection by root knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp. Pasteurized greenhouse soil, diluted by two thirds with clean washed sand, is infested with about 15 g of nematode infested tomato roots and soil. The test formulation contains 0.056 g of test compound, 4.0 ml stock emulsifier solution 0e25 percent Triton X 155 in acetone by volume and 96.0 ml deionized water, giving a concentration of 560 p.p.m. Lower concentrations are achieved by dilution. Treatment is accomplished by adding 50 ml of the formulated compound into a plastic bag which contains enough infested soil to fill two 4 inch round pots. This is thoroughly mixed, then returned to the pots, after which 5 cucumber seeds Ohio MR17 var. are planted per pot. Two standards are included with each test, Phenamiphos and Aldicarb are most often used, with Carbofuran and Ethoprop used as substitutes. Standard formulations are treated at i40 p.p.m. with lower concentrations achieved by dilution. Roots are reinoved from the soil after three weeks of growth and rated for gall root knot nematode infection formulation. A rating of infection from 0 to 10 is recorded 0 no galls or complete control and 10 heavily galled roots comparable to controls. Each of the root systems is rated separately. The average of each treatment is substracted from the average of the control check, that sum is then divided by the average of the control check and multiplied by 100 to obtain a percent nematode control. Percent control equals 100 x average of control check average of treatment average of control check The results obtained with selected compounds of the invention are shown in Table VIII.

SOUTHERN CORN ROOTWORM LARVAE OF SPOTTED CUCUMBER BEETLE The test organisms are six to ten day old larvae of a chlorinated hydrocarbon resistant strain of Diabrotica Undecimpunctata howardi Barb. On the day before test compounds are to be screened, to one ounce polystyrene cups one cup per test compound are added one level teaspoon 5 cm3 air dried greenhouse soil, five corn seeds Zea mays L. var. Popcorn treated with thiram and a second teaspoon of dry soil. The following day, 0.45 ml of standard 128 p.p.m. formulation and 2.0 ml of water are added and the cups are capped. The sample cups are stored under conditions of high humidity in a room at 72 78 F. After four days, the corn seedlings will have shoots 0.5 to 1 inch long, and they will have heaved the covering soil. At this time, 5 to 10 larvae are dropped into each test unit. The cups are then returned to the holding room. Three days after infestation, the test is read. Percentage mortality is determined at the dosage rate. The results are summarized in Table IX.

PLANT GROWTH REGULANT ACTIVITY Compounds of the invention were evaluated relative to plant growth regulant activity against three plant species in a petri dish test. The test is divided into a primary test where 500 pg and 100 rig chemical per petri dish 100 x 25 mm, disposable are tested simultaneously and a secondary test where 50 ug, ro jig and 1 pg chemical per petri dish are tested simultaneously. Compounds which pass the primary test are further evaluated in the secondary test. A special petri dish test may also be run to evaluate particular test compounds, in which case all five rates, i.e., 500, 100, 50, 10 and lyg per petri dish, are tested simultaneously. According to the test procedure, three plant species are planted in a petri dish which has been treated with the test substance. The three species are as follows 1 a mixture of approximately 50 percent light sensitive and 50 percent light insensitive lettuce Lactuca sativa L. Grand Rapids 2 soft red winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. Aestivicum Group Abe 1 and 3 pasturetype perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L. Linn . Wheat and perennial ryegrass seeds are surface sterilized with 1 percent sodium hypochloride for 10 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. Each test compound is formulated in acetone and aliquots of the test formulation are placed on three layers of sterilized filter papers Whatman No. 1, 8.26 cm diameter in each petri dish. As soon as the acetone evaporates, 7 ml of deionized water are added into each petri dish with an appropriate automatic dispenser. Then, 5 to 8 wheat seeds, 10 to 15 perennial ryegrass seeds and 10 to 15 lettuce seeds are placed on the filter paper of each petri dish. Dishes are then covered and seeds are germinated for 3 days at 200 C at a relative humidity of 65 in the dark. The dishes are then removed from the dark growth chamber and maintained in lighted environmental growth chambers for 4 days. At the end of the seventh day of planting, growth and developmental responses characteristics are evaluated. The compounds of Example Nos. 1, 2, H, 12, 44, 45, 48, 54, 63, 64, 73, 76, 94 and 134 exhibited growth retardant activity. Seed germination, root length and hypocotyl length of lettuce were inhibited i.e., between 15 percent and 85 percent inhibition compared to untreated controls at rates ranging from about 100 ,ug dish to 2000 ,ug dish. Root. and coleoptile growth of wheat and ryegrass was inhibited at rates ranging from 10 jug dish to 2000 g dish. Growth stimulation activity was observed with growth of lettuce treated with these compounds was stimulated at rates ranging from about 50 g dish to 500 g dish. ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY Preselected thiolhydroximidates of the invention were incorporated into an agar based fungal growth medium. Spore suspensions of five different fungus species were prepared. Drops of each suspension were incubated for 24 or 48 hours. The spores were observed microscopically and rated as indicated inTable X.
