# Replaceable rupture disc cartridge arrangement.

## Abstract
A self sealing and self positioning replaceable rupture disc cartrige arrangement includes a cartridge receptacle 2 mounted in a pressure relief vent 3 having spaced apart opposite end walls 8, 9 with circumferential positioning grooves 55 on respective internal surfaces thereof and a cartridge 4 having a rupture disc 5 mounted therein for removable placement within the cartridge. The cartridge includes seal mounting rings 60, 61 which have circumferential seals 76 thereon, which are resiliently retractable into circumferential channels 64 at opposite ends of the cartridge and which cooperate with the positioning grooves 55 on the cartridge receptacle walls whereby upon placement of the cartridge within the receptacle, the seal mounting rings snap into the positioning grooves. At least one 60 of the seal mounting rings acts as a piston such that when the pressure vent 3 is pressurized, a surface of the seal mounting ring is exposed to gas pressure forcefully to urge the seal mounting ring 60 against an internal surface 57 of the associated end wall 8 of the receptacle positively to seal therebetween.
