Gann 70, 119 123 1979 It has now been found that there are proteins, present at very low levels, in animal, especially mammalian, e.g. human, blood, serum, organs and the like, which can exhibit, in vitro a regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells and,in vivo, a lifesaving effect on cancerous animals. These proteins have been named Santacuarators A, B and C.These Santacuarators can have therapeutic utility owing to their regulative action on the proliferation of cancer cells, irrespective of whether they are in refined form or in the form of a crude powder or mixture obtained at a suitable stage in the manufacturing process. It has also been found that blood, serum or organs include, in addition to Santacuarators, a substance antagonistic thereto. This substance is antagonistic in vitro to the Santacuarator regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells and exerts in vivo a short life effect on cancer cell burdened animal, and its physiological activity is totally contrary to that of Santacuarator. The present inventors named this substance Daemocuarator ecause of its chemical, physical and biological characteristics. In other words, one embodiment of the present invention consists in blood, serum, extract of removal organ or the like having an improved regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells that is obtained by subjecting an aqueous extract of human or animal blood, serum or removal organ to extractive treatment using an organic solvent or treatment using an adsorbent or concurrent use of both treatments and thus removing or reducingDaemocuarator, namely a substance antagonistic to Santacuarator the factor having a regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells Another embodiment of the present invention consists in a glycoprotein named Santacuarator A fractionated from human or animal blood, serum or extract of removal organ and having a regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells, which is a white powder having a melting point of 240 2500C decomposition has a molecular weight of about 74000 measured by 10 sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis is soluble in water and insoluble in butanol acetone, ethyl acetate, chloroform, benzene and hexane has an aminoacid composition comprising aspartic acid 9.7 , ., , , serin 2.3 , glutamic acid 10.0E, proline 5.8 , 7.7 , alanine 5.8 , valine 8.8 , methionine 0.8 , soleucle 3.2 , leucine 7.5t, tyrosine 3.5 , phenylalanine 3.5 , lysine6 .2 , histidine 1.8 and arginire 4.0E is positive in all In other words, by changing the naturation degree of salt for instance into 40 , 90 and 1000 in the practice of above mentioned salting out, actional precipitating in accordance with varied molecular eights, enhancing the purity of precipistates by molecular sieve absorption and elusion and thereafter carefully fractionating said precipitates there can be obtained the following Santacuarator A, B and C.

More preferably, crude powers of Santacuarator can be obtained in the manner of first adding ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride common salt or the like to mammalian blood, serum or 1aqueous extract of removal organ such as liver, kidney or the like, thereby salting out the effective component, dialyzing said precipitate and then drying. The thus obtained crude powders may be further refined by musing, singly or in combination, column chromatography charged with ion exchange resin Sephadex, active carbon, silica gel, diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose or the like, electrophoresis using polyacrylamide gel, saccharose or the like, precipitation on isoelectric point or the like, and besides Santacuarator may be refined by making an adsorbent such as silica gel, bentonite, acid clay, active carbon or the like adsorb it thereon. The protein substance Santacuarator thus separated from human or animal blood, serum or extract of removal organ exhibits an extremely specific physiological activity as described above and so is very useful as an antitumor agent. The present inventors have continued their studies on this novel protein Sanvacuarator to find that said protein is not a single substance .but may be separated into some components which have each a regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells. These com parents were named Santacuarator A, B and C. absorption maximum 278 nm in pH 7 water refer to Fig. 3 absorption maximum 277 nm in pH 10.0 water refer to Fig. 4 Santacuarator B External appearance white powder Melting point 220 2250C decomposition Property Protein Molecular weight about 22000 determined by 10 sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis Solubility soluble in water and insoluble in acetone, ethyl acetate, benzene, hexane and chloroform Aminoacid composition aspartic acid 8.9 , threonine 6.6 , serine 6.4 , gultamine acid 10.9 , proline 4.8 , glycine 4.4 , alanine 7.1 , cysteine 12.3t, valine 5.8 , methionine 0.7 , isoleucine 2.4 , leucine 8.8 , tyrosine 2.8 , phenyl alanine 5.0 , lysine 7.6 , histidine 2.5E and arginine 3.5 Color reaction positive in ninhydrine reaction and negative in anthrone, Molish and periodic acid reactions Infrared absorption spectrum refer to Fig. 5 measured with KBr pellet Ultraviolet absorption spectrum absorption maximums 283 nm and 289 nm in pH 3 water refer to Fig. 6 absorption maximum 280 nm in pH 7 water refer to Fig. 7 absorption maximum 278 nm in pH 10.0 water refer to Fig. 8 Santacuarator C External appearance white powder Melting point 235 2400C decomposition Property protein Molecular weight about 14000 determined by 10 sodium dodecylsulfate electrophoresis Solubility soluble in water and insoluble in acetone, ethyl acetate, benzene, hexane and chloroform Aminoacid composition aspartic acid 10.5 , threonine 7.1 serine 6.2 , gultamic acid 12.5 , proline 5.2 , glycine 4.7, alanine 8 0t, cysteine 1.7 , valine 6.1 , methionine 0.7 , isoleucine 2.7 , leucine 10.5 , tyrosine 3.1 , phenyl alanine 5.7 , lysine 8.5 , histidine 2.8 and arginine 4.1 Color reaction positive in ninhydrine reaction and negative in anthrone, Molish and periodic acid reactions Infrarol tic spectrum refer to Fig. 9 measured with KBr pellet ultraviolet absorption spectrum shoulder 280 nm in pH 3 water refer to Fig. 10 absorption maximum 290 nrn in li I water refer to Fig. 11 absorption maximum 277 nm in pH 10.0 water refer to Fig. 12 According to 7 acrylamide gel electrophoresis, the abeve mentioned Santacuarator A, Santacuarator B and Santacuarator C do not transfer from their original points at pH 6.5, and transfer therefrom at pH 8.0, pH 9.5 and pH 10.0 respectivel to exhibit a single band. Accordingly, fractionation can also be made by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in lieu of chromatography. It is needless to say that Santacuarator A, Santacuarator B and Santacuarator C obtained according the aforesaid refining process can be used as agents for regulating proliferation of cancer cells. In addition, their crude powder obtained at respective stages of the refining process can also be used for various purposes as agents for regulating proliferation of cancer cells. This Santacuarator is effective in the simple form free of or in the mixture form with other components, and can be prepared into various medicine forms e.g. for injection.Santacuarator should be said to have the specific physiological activity in that it has a regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells and exhibits a marked life saving effect on cancer cell burdened animal, especially in that it has a strong regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells, while it does not exhibit in vitro any killing action on cancer cells, is of no virulence against human beings and animals and does not exert any notable regulative action on normal cells, and therefore should be extremely valuable as medicine. At is ev t F or the a oreqoina, Santacuarator is surely possessed of the specific physiological activity but on the other hand it is in need of the comparatively complicated separatior refining process. In view of tis, one embodiment of the present invention is directed toward improvements in the regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells inherent in Santacuarator, wherein Santacuarator is not isolated from but Daemocuarator is removed rorn blood, serum oP extract of organ or the like, said Daemocuarator being a substance contained in the extract together with Santacuarator and antagonistic thereto.This Daemocuarator is a colorless needle crystalline neutral substance, is soluble in organic solvents, and seems to be not a simple substance but comprised of Daemocuarator A, 3, C and so on refer to Figures 13 i5 .These components A, B and C are common in that they are water insoluble, are soluble in organic solvents and exhibit, both in vitro and in vivo, an antagonistic action to the Santa curator group. Due to this, these Daemocuarator A, B and C will be named Daemocuarator generically in the present invention.As at described above, Santacuarator is water soluble and 11insoluble in organic solvents, while Daemocuarator is water1insoluble and soluble in organic solvents. Therefore, DaemoIcuarator may be said to be antagonistic in physiological activity to Santacuarator. Accordingly, the removal of this Daemocuarator from blood or extract of organ permits to enhance the physiologicat activity of Santacuarator and obtain blood, serum or extract of removal organ effective for the purpose of regulating proliferatior of cancer cells even when dispensing with the step of separationrefining Santacuarator. Separation of Daemocuarator, the substance antagonistic to Santacuarator, from blood, serum or extract of removal organ may blood, serum or c.xt ict i organ boy means of absorption method because Daemocuarator hat a property of being adsorbed readil on the adsorbent such as àiatomaceous earth, claim kaolin, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or the like. The Daemocuarator removed or reduced blood, serum or extract of organ according to the present invention may be used, as it stands, or the purpose of medical treatment because it is able to effectively regulate the proliferation of cancer cells without killing them, can display the inherent physiological activity inSantacuarator, namely the animal life saving effect, to the full, and has an improved regulative action on proliferation of cancer cells, besides may be prepared into various medicine shapes by combination with other medicines.The precipitate obtained by the addition of a salt such as ammonium sulfate or an organic solvent such as alcohol or the like to this extract, namelySantacuarator complex, is also possessed of the inhibitated action on proliferation of cancer cells, and further the dried and I aqueous Santacuarator complexes are also available for the purpose of inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. The blood, serum or extract of organ according to the present invention may be said to have a point of advantage worthy of special mention as compared witch usual medicines used for regulating proliferation of cancer cells in that even the extract obtained from treatment of a living body component such as blood or the like does not exhibit any virulence on human bodies. Next, the present invention will be more detailed with reference to embodiments, wherein, however, the kinds of additives and their mixing ratios should not be limited to those shown in the respective embodiments and may be varied in wide ranges. be achieved by subjecting blood, serum or aqueous retract of organ to direct extraction treatment using an organic solvent or absorption treatment using an adsorbent or the combination out both treatments making use of the abovementioned characteristics of Daemocuarator being soluble in an organic solvent and easily adsorbed on an adsorbent, thereby removing Daemocuarator therefrom. As the organic solvent there may be used aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, esters, ethers and nitriles, and as the adsorbent there may be used any optional one of active carbon, silica gel, diato maceous earth, clay, kaolin, alumina and the like, especially preferably utilized benzene, ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane, butanol, methylethyl ketone and the like. In this connection, it is to be noted that in the case of blood or serum it is possible to use acetone, alcohol and the like, but in the case of an aqueous extract of organ it is desirable to selectively use an organic solvent or an adsorbent that has no miscibiiity jwith water.As at the result of the abovementioned simple operation of extracting blood, serum or extract of organ with an organic solvent or adsorbing it using an adsorbent, Santacuarator, a factor acting to regulate proliferation of cancer cells, is allowed to remain in the water phase, while Daemocuarator, a substance antagonistic to Santacuarator, transfers to the organic phase or adsorption phase, whereby both are separated from each other and blood, serum or extract of organ improved in the reguiative action on proliferation of cancer cells can be obtained, that is the action of Santacuarator. r tr rav e removed or reduced easily from in acetone, ethyl acetate, benzene, hexane and chloroform has an aminoacid composition comprising aspartic acid 10.5 , threonine 7.1t, serine 6.2, gultamic acid 12.5. proline 5.2, glycine 4.7 , alanine S.0t, cysteine 1.7 , valine 6.15, methionine 0.7, isoleucine 2.7 , leucine 10.5 , tyrosine 3.1 , phenylalanine 5.7 , lysine 8.5, histidine 2.8E and arginine 4.1 is positive in ninhydrine reaction and negative in anthrone, Molish and periodic acid reactions represents the infrared absorption spectrum KBr pellet shown in Fig. 9 and exhibits the shoulder of ultraviolet absorption at 280 nm in pH 3 water and the maximum of ultraviolet absorption at 290 nm in pH 7 water and at 277 nm in pH 10.0 water.
