# AN AGRO CHEMICAL COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A material containing an agro chemical agent consists of porous pellets or particles or sintered fly ash that have been emersed in a hot aqueous solution of an agro chemical agent such as a fertilizer, pesticide and or fungicide. The pellets are dried and when subsequently incorporated in a compost or applied to a field gradually release the agro chemical agent over a period of time. The pellets or particles may be coated with a coating to delay the release of the agro chemical agent such as a semi permeable coating, or a coating of low water permeability, or a coating of a biodegradable material.
