# Magnetic transducing head.

## Abstract
A head, comprising a core 1, 6 of magnetisable material having two slightly spaced limbs defining a transducing gap between them, a bundle of insulated wires 4, 5 of electrically conducting material running parallel to the transducing gap being bonded both to the inside and to the outside of at least one core limb 11 the ends of the wires of different bundles located on the same side of the core limb being connected together by means of connection wires 9 in such a manner that a plurality of electrical turns is formed.
