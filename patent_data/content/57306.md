## Abstract
Copper is removed from spent solutions of complexing agents containing cuprous aluminium tetrahalide, in an organic solvent such as CuAlClâ‚„ toluene, by the steps of a contacting said solutions with water so as to form a precipitate of cuprous halide, an aqueous phase and an organic phase b oxidizing the cuprous halide to cupric halide thereby rendering it water soluble c separating the organic phase and aqueous phase, d contacting the aqueous phase with an environmentally suitable metal higher than copper in the electromotive series, such as aluminum, thereby precipitating copper metal and e separating the precipitated copper metal from the aqueous salt containing mixture. Alternatively, the separation of step c can be performed before the oxidation of step b to reduce the volume of liquid material being treated.

## Description
METHOD OF DISPOSING OF SPENT ORGANIC COMPLEXING SOLUTiONS CONTAINING CUPROUS HALIDESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various bimetallic salts and derivatives thereof have been employed in the preparation of scavengers or complexing agents for various liquids such as olefins, aromatics, carbon monoxide and the like as disclosed inU.S. Patents 3,592,865 3,647,843 3,651,159 3,754,047 and 3,755,487. One of the more popular bimetallic salts is cuprous aluminum tetrahalide CuAlX4 generally prepared by reacting a cuprous halide with an aluminum trihalide in a suitable solvent. During prolonged use of these complexing agents, particularly when the feed streams contain olefins and the solvent is an aromatic solvent such as toluene, these agents become contaminated with alkylated aromatics i.e. the aromatic solvent is alkylated by reaction with the olefins which changes the boiling point thereby lowering the efficiency of the recovery process. Disposal of the spent complexing solutions become a problem because they also contain cuprous halides, mostly in the form ofCuAlX4, and the copper ions are not acceptable in waste treatment bio ponds. Therefore there has not been discovered a method for removing the copper from such spent or used complexing solutions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to a process for removing copper from spent cuprous aluminum tetrahalide complexing solutions which process comprises 1 mixing said spent solution with at least 0.5, preferably from about 0.5 to about 3, most preferably from about 0.95 to about 1.05 parts by weight of water per part by weight of said solution, thereby forming a solid precipitate of cuprous halide. an organic phase and an aqueous phase 2a contacting, while agitating, the mixture of step 1 with a suitable oxidizing agent in a suitable quantity for a time sufficient to convert the water insoluble cuprous halide to water soluble cupric halide and separating the organic phase and the aqueous phase or alternatively 2b separating the organic phase and the aqueous phase and contacting, while agita ting, the aqueous phase containing the insoluble cuprous halide with a suitable oxidizing agent in a suitable quantity for a time sufficient to convert the water insoluble cuprous halide to water soluble cupric halide 3 contacting the aqueous phase containing the dissolved cupric halide with an environ mentally acceptable metal higher than cbpper in the electromotive series thereby precipitating copper metal and 4 recovering by suitable means, the precipi tated copper metal. In a preferred process for recovering copper from spent cuprous aluminum tetrahalide complexing solutions, the process comprises 1 mixing said solution with at least 0.5, preferably from about 0.5 to about 3, most preferably from about 0.95 to about 1.05 parts by weight of a 1 molar to 6 molar preferably 1 molar to 2 molar aqueous solution of a non oxidizing acid per part by weight of said complexing solution thereby forming an aqueous phase containing the cuprous halide and an organic phase 2 separating the organic phase and the aqueous phase 3 contacting the aqueous phase containing the dissolved cuprous halide with an environmentally acceptable metal higher than copper in the electromotive series thereby precipitating copper metal and 4 recovering by suitable means, the precipi tated copper metal.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Particularly suitable cuprous aluminum halide solvent complexes which can be treated by the process of the present invention include, for example, the chlorides, bromides and iodides preferably the chlorides. Particularly suitable solvents are the aromatic solvents, such as, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, mixtures thereof and the like, preferably toluene. Particularly suitable non oxidizing acids which can be employed include for, example, SC1, iBr, H2S04, B3PO4, mixtures thereof and the like. Particularly suitable oxidizing agents include, for example, 02, air, C1z, Br2, alkali or alkaline earth metal oxyhalides such as, for example, NaOCl, NaOBr, KOC1, LiOCl, Ca OCl 2, Ba OCl 2, Mg OCl 2, mixtures thereof and the like.The oxidizing agent is employed in sufficient quantities to convert substantially all of the Cu copper to Cu copper so as to render the copper salt soluble in the aqueous phase therefore, at least l equivalent of oxidizing agent per equivalent of cuprous copper ion is employed, preferably from about 1 to about 5 and most preferably from about 1.1 to about 1.5 equivalents of oxidizing agent per equivalent of cuprous ion is employed. In some instances it is desirable to slightly acidify the aqueous mixture to lower the pre to below 7 before contacting it with the oxidizing agent, so as to speed the oxidation process particularly when oxidizing agents such as the alkali or alkaline earth metal oxyhalides are employed since they oxidize more efficiently under acidic conditions. Suitable metals which are acceptable to environmental bio treatment ponds include, for example, Fe, Al, Mg, mixtures thereof and the like with aluminum being preferred. the quantity of metal is that quantity sufficient to reduce substantially all of the cuprous Cu or cupric Cu copper to copper metal therefore at least 1, preferably from about 1 to about 10, most preferably from about 1.0 to about 2.0 equivalents of metal per equivalent of cuprous or cupric copper ion is employed. In step 1, the spent solvent solution is usually and preferably added to the water or aqueous acid solution, but the water or agueous acid solution can be added to the solvent solution. Any suitable temperature can be employed however, temperatures of from OOC to about 100 C, preferably from about 50C to about 250C, are particularly suitable. In the separation step, the aqueous and organic phases can be separated by any known means such as, for example, by methods involving differences in specific gravity, including tilting plate separation, or by injection of air bubbles in the phase mixture air flotation and the like. The organic phase from the separation step can then be disposed of by any environmentally acceptable means such as by burning. The precipitated copper metal can be recovered by any suitable means such as filtration, decantation, centrifugation and the like. The resulting aqueous salt containing stream can then be disposed of by passing it through biotreatment ponds. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention, but are not to be construed as to limiting the scope thereof in any manner.EXAMPLE 1 To a beaker containing 202.0 g of an aqueous solution of 1 m H2SO4 was added, at room temperature 230C 51.710 g of a spent CuA1C14 toluene complexing solution containing 0.1179 moles of CuAlC14 .1179 equiva lents of Cu . The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes during which time an exotherm was noted. The mixture resulted in an aqueous phase and an organic phase which were separated. To the aqueous phase was added 2.7 g 0.222 equivalents of powdered magnesium which precipitated copper metal, 5 grams 0.0787 equivalents of which was recovered by filtration. There was recovered 66.75 of the copper contained in the spent solution.EXAMPLE 2 To a beaker containing 203.13 g of water was added 69.36 g of spent CuAlCl4toluene complexing solution containing 10.25 g 0.1613 moles of copper. At the onset of this addition the temperature was 60C and the highest temperature during hydrolysis was 470C. After cooling to room temperature, the phases were separated into an organic and an aqueous phase by means of a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase, containing the undissolved cuprous chloride, was treated with air via a gas dispersion tube and the solution was agitated by a magnetic stirrer. The then solubilized cupric chloride 0.323 equivalents of Cu was reduced to copper metal by the addition of 4.40 g 0.362 equivalents of magnesium. The magnesium was added slowly. There was recovered by filtration 9.76 g of copper metal resulting in an efficiency of copper removal of 95.22 from that contained in the spent solution.
