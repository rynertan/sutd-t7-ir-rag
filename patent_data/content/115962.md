# Impedance discriminator responsive to operation of switches mounted on a steering wheel.

## Abstract
Apparatus for effecting the impedance discrimination for use in an automobile comprises a plurality of switches 11 14 mounted on a steering wheel, and a plurality of first impedance elements 15 17 for providing a different impedance in response to the operatin of each switch. A second impedance element 131 is coupled through a common slip ring connec tion 8, 9 to the first impedance elements for feeding a current from a battery 1 to the first impedance elements 15 17 to generate a potential corresponding to the operation of one of the switches. A transistor 133 provides a horn activating sig nal when the potential reaches a predetermined value. A re sistance network 141 144 141 142, 150 154 derives a first value corresponding to the first potential and a second value corresponding to the battery potential. A potential discrimina tor 110 derives a relative value from the first and second values and detects which one of the switches is operated as a function of the relative value to generate a control signal asso ciated with the operated switch.
