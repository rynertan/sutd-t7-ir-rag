# Low thermal expansion resin material for a wiring insulating film.

## Abstract
A resin material comprising a polyimide having as chemical structural unit at least one aromatic ring which can rotate around its molecular axis but has no flexibility at another direction, said polyimide being oriented at least at a uniaxial direction, has a low thermal expansion coefficient and can be shaped together with an inorganic material into one body to give a composite shaped article.
