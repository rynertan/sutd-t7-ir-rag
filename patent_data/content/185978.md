## Description
The invention relates to an improved integrated random access read write memory array as defined in the preamble of claim 1. With the emergence of VLSI through the advances of integrated circuit technology, denser random access memory RAM array chips with high speed access times are an absolute requirement in computing machine designs. As the industry strives for higher and higher computing speeds, measured in millions of instructions per second MIPS , the time required to complete each instruction must be decreased. By increasing array densities, the number of array chips required to perform a specific function is reduced and therefore the overall function delay. The invention disclosed and claimed herein is an improved random access memory RAM which positively addresses the requirements of speed, size area , stability and alpha particle sensitivity. The complementary transistor switch CTS memory cell is well known to the art. See for example 1 U. S. Patent No. 3863229 entitled SCR or SCS Memory Array With Internal and External Load Resistors , granted January 28, 1975 to J. E. Gerbach and of common assignee with the subject application 2 AC Write Scheme For Bipolar Random Access Memories Using Schottky Coupled Cells by J. A. Dorler et al, IBM TDB Vol. 23, No. 11, April 1981 or, 3 A 1024 Byte ECL Random Access Memory Using a Complementary Transistor Switch CTS Cell by J. A. Dorler et al, IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 25, No. 3, May 1981 pages 126 134. The unclamped complementary transistor switch CTS type memory cell is disclosed in the publication Saturated CTS Memory Cell Using A PNP Load by J. A. Dorler et al, IBM TDB, February 1984, Vol. 26, No. 9, pages 4720 1. Most present array cells are SBD protected against saturation. This was clearly needed when the number of cells was small, the transistors were large and the currents were large to accommodate high speed at high capacitances. This would have resulted in very long delays for cell saturation if not for the SBD clamps. However, now with better processes and improved lithography, the saturation capacitance of the cell can be equal to or less than the metal line capacitance of the array. With the advent of improved circuit designs and very low standby currents typically 5 ÂµA the SBD s are no longer required. What is being disclosed here is the removing of the clamp SBD from the array cells. In summary, removing the SBD diodes will enable future arrays to be These comparisons were made using the same layout groundrules and photolithography restrictions that are representative of current technology. It can be appreciated that even more benefit can be achieved with future lithography improvements. The unclamped CTS cell has a long write time because of high stability. The use of a shunt to fix the word to drain line voltage is of great benefit to the stabilization of cell current and therefore saturation capacitance. It has been shown that it will improve the write time of the cell by a factor of eight. The primary object of the invention is to provide an improved random access read write memory array employing modified CTS type memory cells of small area, high stability, low power requirements, high reliability fewer components , materially enhanced write operation time and relatively high immunity to alpha particle errors . The solution of the object is disclosed in the characterized part of claim 1. Improvements are characterized in Claims 2 6. The concern over alpha particle sensitivity is fairly recent but a detailed explanation of bipolar RAM sensitivity to alpha particle bombardment can be found in the references set forth hereinafter. The modified CTS cell is at least an order of magnitude less sensitive to alpha particle errors than a comparable cell made with the same technology. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the following more particular descripton of the preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Refer to figure 5A, B and C for the preferred embodiment of the invention. In an array of memory cells comprised of M columns and N rows, a cell is selected by simultaneously raising the voltage on the pair of bit lines and lowering the voltage on the word and drain lines it is connected to. The method of lowering the voltage on the word and drain lines has almost exclusively been used to cause a higher current to flow through the memory cell and reinforce the state it is in. This method allows a faster read operation because the increased current flow is easier to sense. However in the case of the modified CTS cell, an increase in cell current is highly ditrimental to the ability to change the cells state when writing it. The current through the modified CTS cell is exponentially related to the voltage from word line to drain line. The use of a word to drain line shunt, in this case is a simple PN diode, to fix the word to drain line difference is a tremendous aid in stabilizing the cell current even though the word and drain line voltage changes substantially during selection. Refer to figure 5A, B and C during the following explanation of the read and write operation. For a cell to be read or written it must be in a fully selected state, cells in a half selected state are immune from read or write operations. A cell is selected in the word dimension by lowering the voltage on the word and drain line WL and DL it is connected to. A cell is selected in the bit dimension by raising the voltage on the bit lines BL and BR it is connected to. A cell that is connected to a selected pair of bit lines and selected word drain lines is fully selected, and its content may be read or altered. Reading the content of a cell is accomplished by sensing a differential voltage or current in the bit lines. For example, if the cell contains a 0 , which could be defined by transistor NPNL conducting, it could be read by the bit decode circuit raising the voltage of node BIT, and the word decode lowering the voltage of node DL. If NPNL was conducting then in fully selected state collector current would flow thru RBL and DL, the base current for NPNL is supplied thru RBR and DR. Transistor PNPL is slightly conducting while PNPR and NPNR are nonconducting. The differential current that flows in the bit lines is determined by the beta of the NPN transistor in the cell. Typically the beta value is 100 and the voltage difference between the bit lines or the differential current between TBSL and TBSR can easily be sensed. When the bit decode selects the proper bit column to read, it also does one other thing it enables the write circuit. If a pulse occurs on the WC line, which is connected to all write circuits, new data will be written into the selected cell. The W1 and W0 lines are always out of phase with each other, for the case of writing a 1 the W1 line would be high and W0 low. The cell is brought into the fully selected state by the word and bit decoders. The write circuit is enabled by raising the BS line. The writing is accomplished by a pulse on the WC line. When WC goes high current will flow thru RL and TCL because W1 is high and W0 is low. RL and RR regulate the amount of current thru TCL or TCR. When a PN junction is foward biased it is well known that it stores charge in its depletion layer. This charge is what is used to write the cell. When WC falls transistor TWC turns off. Node C will rise to the positive supply thru resistor RC. The charge that was stored in the base collector junction of TCL gets coupled onto node L. The rise in voltage of node L turns on transistor TBL and raises the voltage of the left bit line BL above the right bit line BR. It should be noted that this technique will raise node L above the positive supply VC. The cell is written when the rising left bit line becomes high enough to turn on NPNR. At this point in time the current in the bit line switches from being the collector current of NPNL to base current of NPNR. The state change of the cell, from 0 to 1, corresponds to an impedance change seen on the bit line by TBL. Because BL is now in a high impedance state there is no good discharge path for node L. If this condition were to remain then the contents of the next selected cell in that bit column could be altered. To remedy that condition diodes D1 and D2 are connected from node L to the opposite bit line that was raised. At the time that BL changed from supplying the collector current of NPNL to supplying the base cutent of NPNR, BR changed from suppling base current of NPNL to collector current of NPNR. As the current in BR increases its voltage drops to the point where D1 and D2 conduct and discharge node L. The base and collector currents of NPNR are eventually supplied by transistors TBSL and TBSR respectively as the write circuit shuts itself off. This self limiting feature of the write circuit makes possible high speed write operation and very low power dissipation. It can be appreciated that the write circuit uses power only when the write pulse is high, typically a low duty cycle. At all other times and for all unselected bit columns the write circuit dissipates zero power. Although the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
