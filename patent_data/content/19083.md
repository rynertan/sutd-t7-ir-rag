# Magnetic head mounting assemblies.

## Abstract
A magnetic head arm suspension assembly which supports air bearing head sliders and magnetic transducers 48 comprises a rigid load beam 24 coupled to a box like arm 22 through a spring element which has flexible legs 28, one each side of beam 24. The load beam 24 seats in an aperture in the upper wall of the arm, and is positioned so that the centerlines of the load beam and of the spring are coincident. The beam can move laterally without tilting through the aperture to raise and lower the heads 48. In this manner, the sliders and magnetic transducers 48, which are mounted to the suspension arms 42 are loaded in a direction perpendicular to the planar surface of a moving storage medium and maintained in a parallel plane relative to the planar surface of the medium.
