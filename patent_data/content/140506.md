# Combined power steering pump and vacuum pump assembly.

## Abstract
A combined power steering pump and vacuum pump assembly is disclosed wherein a vented reservoir 18 is connected to receive discharge air from the vacuum pump 28 as well as supply fluid for circulation by and lubrication of the power steering pump 10. A sealing arrangement 44 seals the vacuum pump from the power steering pump when the pumps are stopped, but provides limited delivery of fluid from the power steering pump to the vacuum pump when the pumps are running, whereby the fluid in the power steering system is prevented from draining into the vacuum pump when stopped but is delivered thereto when running to lubricate same and is then delivered with the discharge air to the reservoir, so that there is no loss of fluid from the power steering system in lubricating the vacuum pump.
