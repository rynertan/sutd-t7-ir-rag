# Microwave ice accretion meter.

## Abstract
A microwave ice accretion meter comprises a shorted surface waveguide 15 connected to a controlled oscillator 17 and mounted, for instance, in an air foil 10 . A detector 21 is connected to the waveguide for detecting the electrical energy incident on the detector. A control 18 for controlling the frequency of the oscillator and an indicator 19, 20 for indicating deviation of the frequency of the oscillator from the normal ice free resonant frequency of the waveguide are provided. The control is adjusted while observing the detector to determine the shift in resonant frequency of the waveguide, which shift indicates the thickness of ice accretion on the air foil.
