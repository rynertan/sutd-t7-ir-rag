## Description
Novel urea derivative, a process for its preparation, herbicidal composition containing it, a method of combating undesired plant growth using it The invention relates to a novel urea derivative, a process for its preparation, herbicidal composition containing it, a method of combating undesired plant growth using it. US Patent Specification No. 2655447 discloses an extremely large class of urea derivatives which can be used as herbicides.Said specification, however, contains no suggestion that such ureas have any selective action between weeds and crops.Surprisingly, it has now been found that a specific urea derivative within the scope of said specification but not specifically disclosed therein, has useful selective herbicidal properties. The invention provides the compound N 2 methoxy 3 propylphenyl N methylurea. The invention also provides a process for theSpreparation of said compound, characterised in that a compound of the general formula CH3X is reacted with a compound of the general formulaEMI1.1 in which one of X and Y represents an isocyanate group and the other represents an amino group. Suitably the reaction is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent, for example an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 1000C, especially 15 to 0T5 C. Room temperature is generally convenient. The reaction is suitably performed in the presence of a base. This may be an excess of one of the reactants, especially when using methylamine as a reactant, or an additional base, for example an amine, may be added. It has been found that N 2 methoxy 3 propylphenyl N methylurea possesses useful herbicidal properties, controlling both broad leaved and grassy weeds. In particular, it has been found that when it is applied pre emergence applied to the soil before the plants sprout it kills such weeds at dosages at which it is only slightly toxic to wheat. It thus is of interest for controlling weeds in plantings of wheat. The invention therefore also provides a herbicidal composition which comprises the compound according to the invention together with a suitable carrier, and also provides a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus, which comprises applying to the locus the compound or a composition according to the invention.In particular, the compound or composition may be applied to a crop area sown with wheat, before the emergence of the wheat. The amount of the compound according to the invention, to be used in combating undesirable vegetation will naturally depend on the condition of the vegetation, the degree of activity desired, the formulation used, the mode of application, the climate, the season of the year, and other variables. Recommendations as to precise amounts are, therefore, not possible. In general, however, application to the locus to be protected of from 0.1 to 10.0 kilograms per hectare of said compound will be satisfactory. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane.Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic.Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty aleohol or alkyl phenols, for example octylphenol or E octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols.Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 and 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar compositions to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing a 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 25 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water inoil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The compositions of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, other compounds possessing insecticidal, herbicidal or fungicidal properties. The following Examples illustrate the invention. The identities of intermediates and the final product in Examples 1 and 2 were confirmed by chemical and spectral analyses.Example 1 12.0 g of sodium hydride 50 in mineral oil were added, in portions, to a stirred solution of 68.9 g of 2 propylphenol in 350 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide, the temperature of the mixture being held below 400C. The mixture was then stirred for one 0 hour at 40 C, when a solution of 78.1 g of methyl iodide in 50 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide was slowly added, the temperature of the mixture being held below 600cm The resulting mixture was held overnight at room temperature, then poured into water and extracted with diethyl ether. The extract was washed with 10 sodium hydroxide solution, then with water, and dried, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give l methoxy 2 propylbenzene IA , as a liquid. A mixture of 67.2 g of IA, 83.8 g of silver nitrate and 350 ml of acetonitrile was stirred at room temperature until 0 the solids were in solution. The solution was cooled to 5 C and slowly dripped into a solution of 38.7 g of acetyl chloride in 50 ml of acetonitrile. The resulting mixture was stirred for two hours at 0 50C, and was then allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and stirred overnight. The mixture was then cooled to 50C and 750 ml of water was added. The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, 500 ml of water were added and the resulting mixture was filtered. The filtrate was extracted with diethyl ether.The extract was washed with 10 sodium hydroxide solution, then with water, dried, and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give a product IB containing two significant components. 20.0 g of IB dissolved in tetrahydrofuran were treated with hydrogen 60 psig, approximately 4 atmospheres guage in a Parr apparatus, using Raney nickel as catalyst. The resulting mixture was filtered to give a solution IC containing two significant components. 3.2 g of methyl isocyanate and 8 10 drops of triethylamine were added to one half of IC at room temperature and the mixture was held overnight. The solvent was then evaporated under reduced pressure. Diethyl ether was added to the residue and the resulting mixture was filtered. The solvent was evaporated from the filtrate under reduced pressure and the residue was chromatographed over silica gel, using a 14 30 66 v v v mixture of tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate and hexane as eluent. Two products were isolated and identified by appropriate chemical and spectral analyses N 2 methoxy 3 propylphenyl N methyl urea as a solid, mp 79 810C, and an isomer.Example 2 200 g of allyl chloride were added over a two hour period to a mixture of 600 ml of water, 80 g of sodium hydroxide and 278 g of 2 nitrophenol. The mixture was refluxed for two hours, and was then extracted with a 3 1 v v mixture of hexane and toluene. Evaporation of the solvent gave allyl 2 nitrophenyl ether, as a light yellow liquid, bp 96 980C 0.15 Torr. . 54 g of that product was heated at 1800C for two hours, 0 then the temperature was gradually raised. At 200 C an exo thermic reaction occurred, and the temperature of the mixture rose to 2500C and was held there by cooling. The resulting mixture was purified by silica gel chromatography to give 2 allyl6 nitrophenol, as a yellow oil. 30 g of the phenol were mixed with 75 ml of methanol to which had been added 10 g of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 10 ml of water. Two equivalents of sodium hydroxide were added, and then two equivalents of dimethyl sulphate were added drop by drop to the stirred mixture. The mixture was then refluxed for two hours. Workup of the resulting mixture gave methyl 2allyl 6 nitro phenyl ether, as a dark yellow oil. 28.5 g of the ether was reduced in a Parr shaker, three hours at 60 psig hydrogen pressure, tetrahydrofuran solvent, palladium on charcoal catalyst, to give 2 methoxy 3 propylaniline, as a liquid. Excess phosgene was added to a solution of the aniline in 400 ml of ethyl acetate and the mixture was refluxed to give 2 methoxy 3 propylphenylisocyanate. Excess methylamine was added to a solution of 10 g of the isocyanate in 75 ml of diethyl ether. An exothermic reaction occurred and a solid product precipitated. The mixture was filtered and the solid product was purified to give the desired 0 product as a white solid, mp 74 77 C.
