# SUPPORTING DEVICE FOR ELASTICALLY SUPPORTING A MASS AND FOR DAMPING VIBRATIONS

## Abstract
A supporting device according to the invention for elastically supporting a mass 8 comprises a box 1 , an anchor 5 that is movable in the direction of the vibrations of the mass, a spring 4 that is interposed between the box and the anchor, and an annular shaped damping element 12 fixed to the box itself. The anchor 5 is provided with first abutment walls 20 , that are apt for coming into contact with second abutment walls 22 that are formed on a bush 16 that is fixed to said damping element 12 , whenever axial movement of said anchor, with respect to said bush, is greater than a predetermined movement.
