# Plated through hole apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for depositing a thin layer of metal within the hole of an object such as a printed circuit board. The apparatus includes a gas diffusion chamber having a plurality of power electrodes positioned transverse ly therein. The objects to be treated, such as printed circuit boards, are positioned in the areas between the power electrodes. A supply of electrical energy is connected to the power electrode and to the conductive layers of the printed circuit boards. The method of the invention comprises introducing desired gases into the chamber to flow trans versely through the power electrodes and the printed circuit boards such that the gases are excited to a plasma state to sputter a portion of the material constituting the power electrodes into the holes of the printed circuit boards.
