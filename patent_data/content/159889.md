## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to new organic compounds and more particularly, new 4 substituted piperazine 2 carboxylic acids of interest as agents influencing the control nervous system, their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and the compounds for use in methods of therapy practised on the human or animal body. Various amino acids have recently become of interest following the discovery that they are able to influence the activity of certain receptor sites in the central nervous system and attention has been directed to the identification of materials that will have specific action in relation to these receptor sites with a view of identifying compounds that can be used to control various involuntary muscular activity and or mental and or affective disorders resulting from central nervous system malfunction. Bettinetti et al., Ann. Chim. Rome 1961, 51, p.1102 1112, describe the production of a compound of the formula as an intermediate in a study of the catalytic reduction of imides and anhydrides of quinoxaline 2,3 dicarboxylic acid. We have now found that certain 4 substituted piperazine 2 carboxylic acids, which is a type of structure not previously investigated in relation to such activity, do act as depressants of electrical activity at certain receptor sites of the central nervous system. Accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of the general formula wherein X is a C₁ C₆, preferably C₁ C₄, straight chain saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl group, the group R⁴ and the group Y are situated in any position in this chain and wherein one or more of the hydrogen atoms in X can be a heavy isotope of hydrogen where R⁶ and R⁷, which may be the same or different, is each hydrogen or an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group, wherein the aryl moiety is phenyl or naphthyl, the alkyl moiety has 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the alkyl or aryl part of any one of said groups may optionally be substituted by one or more halogeno groups, or Y is a phenol, uracil, hydantoin, barbituric acid, isoxazole or oxadiazolidindione residue, or X R⁴ Y represents a group CO R⁸ wherein R⁸ is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing up to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl or naphthyl group, which hydrocarbyl, phenyl or naphthyl group may be optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from halogeno, carboxy, hydroxy and C₁ C₆ alkoxy groups In the compounds of the invention it is preferred that X represents a C₃ chain as the indications are that such compounds give rise to the more active compounds. However, compounds of interest can also be secured where X is a C₁, C₂ C₄, C₅ or C₆ straight chain of carbon atoms. Other compounds of interest are those where X is an unsaturated residue and interest here centres particularly upon those compounds containing a chain of three carbon atoms with one site of carbon to carbon unsaturation. The synthetic methods that we adopt lend themselves most readily to the production of compounds containing one olefinic double bond and this may be located between the two carbon atoms nearest to the piperazine ring or between the two carbon atoms furthest from the piperazine ring. Compounds in which at least one of the hydrogen atoms in the X residue represents a heavy isotope of hydrogen are of particular interest in tracer experiments. Such radio active compounds will normally contain two heavy hydrogen atoms since such compounds are most easily prepared by hydrogenation of a compound of the invention containing an olefinic double bond in the group X using tritium. Our previous investigations with acyclic amino acids have shown that the acidic group represented by the group Y is preferably a phosphonic acid or ester thereof and the same preference exists in the piperazine carboxylic acids of the present invention. Whether the phosphonic acid is present in the mono or di ester form or in the free acid form will be governed partly by the manner in which it is desired to use the compound since, while the indications are that it is the free acid form of the compound that exhibits the best activity, certain lipophilic residues are advantageous in the compound to secure passage of the compound through the blood brain barrier to direct the compound to its ultimate site of activity. The present indications therefore are that while As an alternative to a phosphonic acid residue as the group Y, compounds of the present invention can contain a sulphonic, sulphinic, carboxylic or boronic acid residue and, as mentioned above, these acid residues can be present in free acid form or in an ester form, similar considerations applying to the presentation of the compound in free acid or ester form and, in the latter case, to the selection of the esterifying residue. Further alternative groups for Y may include phenol or uracil, or hydantoin, or barbituric acid or isoxazole, or oxadiazolidindione residues. The residue R⁴ in the compounds of the invention is also introduced to influence the hydrophilic lipophilic balance of the compound. In the simplest compounds of the present invention, R⁴ will be hydrogen but alternative structures include compounds where R⁴ represents an alkyl or alkoxy group normally containing up to 6 carbon atoms and preferably containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as a methyl, ethyl, n propyl or n butyl group. When R⁴ represents an alkoxy group, the alkoxy group may contain 1 to 6 and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy or n butoxy. R⁴ may also be a hydroxy group. When R⁴ is an aryl, aryloxy, aralkyl, aralkoxy or aralkylamino group, the aryl residue is preferably a phenyl residue although the aryl residue may also be a napthyl residue. Aralkyl, aralkoxy and aralkylamino residues may be residues in which the alkyl portion contains 1 to 6 and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The alkyl or aryl residue in these compounds may be substituted by at least one halogeno group such as a fluoro, chloro or bromo group. The hydrophilic lipophilic balance of the compounds of the invention can also be favourably influenced by the presence of a morpholino substituent as the group R⁴. R can represent hydrogen or an alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, haloaryl, aralkyl or haloaralkyl residue. When R represents an alkyl group, it may contain 1 to 6 and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms and the aryl residue may be a phenyl or naphthyl residue. Alkyl or aryl residues may also be substituted by one or more halogeno groups such as fluoro, chloro or bromo groups. The group R may be identical to the group R⁶ and or R⁷ and the synthetic methods adopted often will most easily give compounds in which the groups R, R⁶ and, when present, R⁷ are identical. R¹ may also represent hydrogen or an alkyl, haloalkyl, aryl, haloaryl, aralkyl or haloaralkyl group and, as for the group R, the alkyl groups may contain 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms and the aryl groups may be a phenyl or naphthyl residue. When halogeno substituents are present, they may be one or more fluoro, chloro or bromo substituents. The groups R², R³ and R⁵ which may be the same or different, may each be hydrogen or an alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, alkyloxycarbonyl, halo, aryl, haloaryl or aryloxycarbonyl group and once again, alkyl groups may contain 1 to 6 and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms and aryl groups may be a phenyl or naphthyl residue. When substituents are present, these may be one or more fluoro, chloro or bromo groups. Alternatively, R² and R³ may, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached on the piperazine ring, and subject to the proviso above in relation to the definitions of R² and R³ in formula I, form a ring system which may be of aromatic character such as a benzene ring so that the whole ring system is a 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro quinoxaline which may be substituted. When the groups R, R¹, R² and R³ represent alkyl or substituted alkyl groups, it is preferred that the alkyl groups be methyl, ethyl, n propyl or n butyl. When the group X R⁴ Y a carboxylic acyl group, it may be derived from a carboxylic acid R⁸COOH where R⁸ is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon residue containing to 6 and preferably up to 4 carbon atoms or an aromatic ring, which is phenyl or naphthyl, where the aliphatic residue or aromatic ring can be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more halogeno, carboxy, hydroxy or C₁ C₆ alkoxy groups. Preferably, the carboxylic acyl group is derived from benzoic acid or a benzoic acid substituted in the ring by one or more F, Cl or Br groups. When the compounds of the invention contain both basic and acidic functions either or both of the basic and acidic functions can be prepared in the compounds of the invention in salt form. Thus, for formulation reasons, it is often desirable to prepare the 2 carboxylic acid residue and or the acid residue Y in the form of a physiologically acceptable water soluble salt such as the sodium salt. Compounds of the invention in which the groups COOR and Y are in the form of the free acid or an ester thereof or a salt thereof can be prepared in the form of salts of the basic amino groups and here, salts of interest are physiologically acceptable acid addition salts, such is salts with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, or citric acid. The compounds of the invention will always contain a centre of asymmetry at C₂ and possibly elsewhere. The compounds of the present invention include both racemic mixtures and compounds in which C₂ is substantially completely in the R or substantially completely in the S configuration. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by reacting a piperazine 2 carboxylic acid or ester of the formula III with a compound of formula IV in which formulae R, R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵, X and Y are as defined above and Z represents a reactive group such as a halogeno group or p tosyl group. This condensation reaction will normally be carried out under basic conditions. Where X R⁴ Y together represents or contains an acyl group, the compounds can be prepared by reaction of the piperazine with the corresponding acyl halide or other activated acyl precursor, again under basic conditions. More specifically, compounds of the formula IV that may be used include compounds in which the acidic residues in the group Y are in the form of an ester. For example, in the preferred compounds of the invention in which Y represents a phosphonic acid residue, Y in the compound IV can be a phosphonic acid dialkyl ester. Following the condensation reaction, one or both of the ester groupings can be hydrolysed under acidic conditions if desired to give a corresponding invention compound in the form of the free phosphonic acid. When it is desired to prepare compounds in which the acidic residue Y is a sulphonic or sulphinic or carboxylic or boronic acid residue, the experimental methods we have adopted indicate the use of intermediates IV in which the group Y is in the free acid form. If the synthetic methods adopted result in the production of invention compounds in which the group Y is in free acid form, then these acidic groups can be subsequently esterified or converted into salts as desired. Alternatively, where phosphonic acid compounds are to be prepared, these will normally be prepared in the ester form, as indicated above, and if desired, the esters can be subsequently converted into free acid or salts and reconverted into alternative ester forms if required. When it is desired to prepare invention compounds in which X contains carbon to carbon unsaturation, the intermediate IV can be one in which the group X contains corresponding carbon to carbon unsaturation. This will give rise to an invention compound having corresponding carbon to carbon unsaturation although occasionally it is found that migration of the carbon to carbon unsaturation occurs. Invention compounds containing carbon to carbon unsaturation in the group X can be used as such or can be regarded as intermediates for the production of invention compounds in which X represents a saturated group. Thus, the sites of unsaturation can be hydrogenated catalytically under conventional conditions either using hydrogen or using tritium to introduce sites in the molecule for tracer work. It is usually convenient to use intermediates IV in which Z represents a reactive halogeno group, preferably chlorine or bromine but, as indicated above, other synthetic methods can be adopted for reaction at a basic nitrogen atom to introduce the group, X R⁴ Y onto the piperazine ring. Intermediates III can be obtained by hydrogenation of the corresponding pyrazine carboxylic acids. This reduction will normally give rise to a compound that is racemic at C₂ but where individual isomers are required, resolution of hydrogenation products will be carried out prior to reaction with intermediate IV, or the final condensation products will be resolved. When it is desired to produce the invention compounds in the form of salts, salt formation will normally be effected subsequent to reaction of III with IV, but some condensation reactions may give rise to salt products directly. In accordance with a further feature of the invention, we provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The compounds of the invention act on the central nervous system and may be administered parenterally or orally, e.g. intravenously for acute treatment, or subcutaneously or orally for chronic treatment. Compounds of the invention will be formulated for clinical use in suitable vehicles, normally as a preparation of a water soluble salt, though preparations of low water solubility, possibly in association with physiologically tolerable emulsifying agents, may be used for depot administration. Since it is believed to be necessary for compounds of the invention to penetrate the blood brain barrier, it is frequently necessary to administer the compounds of the present invention in amounts significantly in excess of the amounts necessary to be achieved within the brain for the therapeutic effect desired and this will influence the concentration of the active compounds in the compositions of the present invention. Considerations of this type suggest that compositions of the invention might contain the active compound in a concentration such that a conventional dosage volume would provide the subject with up to about 200 mg kg body weight although, when the compounds are to be administered by the intravenous or subcutaneous route, dosages in the region of about 1 20 mg kg body weight are to be expected for the more active compounds and or for those substances with a high lipophilic to hydrophilic balance. In accordance with a further feature of the invention, we provide compounds of formula I and for this purpose, including those compounds where R⁵ represents carboxy when X R⁴ Y represents a group COR⁸ where R⁸ is methyl, R and R¹ each represent H and R² and R³ together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a benzene ring for use in a method of therapy practised on the human or animal body. More specifically, the compounds of the invention have been found to antagonise responses of mammalian central neurones to excitatory amino acids and also to depress spontaneous and evoked synaptic activity in the central nervous system. Amino acid receptors mediate or modulate synaptic excitation of many excitatory synapses in the brain. The compounds of the present invention can modify abnormal central nervous system activity involving amino acid receptors and consequently are of interest in providing beneficial intervention in cases where such abnormalities arise. The following Examples are given to illustrate the invention. Temperatures are in C. Br CH CH CH₂ PO OC₂H₅ ₂ Sodium 3 bromo propane l sulphonate 2 25 g, 0 01 mole was added to a solution of piperazine 2 carboxylic acid 1 3 g, 0 01 mole in aqueous sodium hydroxide 0 9 g NaOH 30 ml H₂O . The resulting solution was maintained at 60 65 Piperazine 2 carboxylic acid 1.3 g, 0.01 mole and 2 chloropropionic acid l l g, 0 0l mole were dissolved in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 0 9 g NaOH 20 ml H₂O and the resulting solution was maintained at 60 65 To an ice cold solution of piperazine 2,3 dicarboxylic acid l 74 g 0 01 mole in aqueous sodium hydroxide l 2 g 20 ml was added 4 bromobenzoyl chloride 2 2 g 0.01 mole over 30 min. The resulting solution was stirred at 0 The compounds of the invention have antagonist action at excitatory amino acid receptors in the central nervous system. There are several different types of these receptors, some or all of which are intimately involved in central nervous function. Three types of receptors that have been described in the neuroscientific literature are known as N methyl D aspartate NMDA , kainate K and quisqualate Q receptors. The compounds of the invention have differential actions at these receptors, some being more effective at NMDA receptors and others at K or Q receptors. Compounds which act at excitatory amino acid receptors can affect the action of natural amino acid transmitter substances and thereby influence the electrical activity of the central nervous system. To evaluate actions of substances at amino acid receptors on nerve cells neurones , the substances may be tested on spinal cord neurones, which have similar characteristics to nerve cells in the brain. Typically, the isolated spinal cord of the frog or 4 8 day old rat is used, and compounds are tested for their ability to affect the activity of spinal neurones induced by excitatory amino acids or by electrical stimulation of afferent fibres, Table 2 shows the relative potencies of some invention compounds relevant to previously known excitatory amino acid antagonists. The most potent NMDA antagonists previously known were 2 amino 5 phosphonopentanoic acid AP5 and 2 amino 7 phosphonoheptanoic acid AP7 , and γ D glutamylglycine γDGG was one of the most potent previously known antagonists of kainate and quisqualate. From Table 2 it can be seen that the invention compound 3 2 carboxypiperazin 4 yl propyl l phosphonic acid CPP is more potent as an antagonist of NMDA and of polysynaptic spinal excitation than is either AP5 or AP7. The invention compound 4 4 bromobenzoyl piperazine 2,3 dicarboxylic acid EBP is a more potent antagonist of kainate and quisqualate induced depolarizations than is γDGG, and is also more potent as a depressant of monosynaptic excitation. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to have anticonvulsant activity. Amongst known excitatory amino acid antagonists, AP7 was previously the most potent anticonvulsant. Table 3 shows that CPP has significantly higher anticonvulsant activity than AP7 when tested against 3 mercaptopropionate induced convulsions in mice.
