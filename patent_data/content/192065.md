## Description
The present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin composition, and more particularly, to a polycarbonate resin composition which is quite excellent in solvent resistance and further which is excellent in stiffness, impact resistance, and properties such as moldability and appearance. This polycarbonate resin composition is useful as a material for use in production of industrial articles such as a car bumper and home electric articles. A polycarbonate resin is known as a molding resin having excellent physical properties e.g., stiffness and thermal properties. A molded article of the polycarbonate resin or polycarbonate resin molding has a disadvantage in that cracks are readily formed in the molding upon application of concentrated stress in a certain kind of solvent. Another disadvantage of the polycarbonate resin as encountered during the molding process is that molding temperature and pressure are high as compared with other resins since its melt viscosity is high. In order to overcome the above problems of the polycarbonate resin, that is, to improve poor solvent resistance and moldability without reducing its inherent excellent physical properties, it has been proposed to compound various polyesters to the polycarbonate resin. For example, a composition comprising a polycarbonate resin and polyalkylene terephthalate derived by copolymerization of a bifunctional carboxylic acid component and a diol component having a large amount of an aromatic ring is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 16137 1982, 37633 1979, and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 102648 1975. This composition, however, has disadvantages in that burning is formed during the molding process because the aromatic ring content of the diol component is increased and in that the diol component is expensive, which is disadvangeous from an economic standpoint. In addition, a composition comprising a polycarbonate resin and polyalkylene terephthalate containing cyclohexanedimethanol as the diol component is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 94536 1978. Addition of this polyalkylene terephthalate, however, seriously decreases stiffness and fails to improve solvent resistance sufficiently. Moreover the composition has a disadvantage in that it is colored and thus can be used only in limited applications. The present invention is intended to overcome the above problems of the conventional polycarbonate resin, and an object of the present invention is to provide a polycarbonate resin composition which is excellent in properties such as solvent resistance, moldability and appearance, and still holds its excellent physical properties. As a result of extensive investigations, it has been found that the object can be attained by compounding a polyesterether elastomer prepared by using a glycol component containing polyalkylene glycol and ethylene glycol in a specific ratio to the polycarbonate resin. The present invention, in one embodiment, relates to a polycarbonate resin composition comprising In another embodiment the second invention , the present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin composition comprising In another embodiment the third invention , the present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin composition comprising In still another embodiment the fourth invention , the present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin composition comprising The polycarbonate resin that is used as the component A in the present invention is a polymer represented by the general formula I The polycarbonate resin can be prepared by the solvent process, that is, by the ester exchange reaction of a dihydric phenol and a carbonate precursor such as phosgene, or a dihydric phenol and a carbonate precursor such as diphenylcarbonate in a solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of an acid acceptor and a molecular weight controlling agent. Dihydric phenols which are preferably used are bisphenols. Of these bisphenols, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A is particularly preferred.

The polycarbonate resin which is used in the present invention may be a thermopolastic random branched polycarbonate resin prepared by reacting a polyfunctional aromatic compound with a dihydric phenol and or carbonate precursor. The viscosity average molecular weight of the polycarbonate resin is preferably 10,000 to 100,000 and especially preferably 20,000 to 40,000 from viewpoints of mechanical strength and moldability. In the present invention, as the component B , a polyesterether elastomer composed of a bifunctional carboxylic acid component and a glycol component comprising polyalkylene glycol and ethylene glycol is used. In the first invention, the polycarbonate resin composition comprises 92 to 10 wt , preferably 90 to 30 wt of the polycarbonate resin as the component A and 8 to 90 wt , preferably 10 to 70 wt of the polyesterether elastomer as the component B . If the amount of the polyesterether elastomer compounded is less than 8 wt , the solvent resistance of the polycarbonate resin composition is not sufficiently high. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 90 wt , the polycarbonate resin composition is seriously decreased in stiffness and is unsuitable for practical use. The polyesterether elastomer that is used in the present invention is a polyesterether elastomer composed mainly of an aromatic dicarboxylate unit represented by the following general formula The bifunctional carboxylic acid component includes aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. Of these compounds, terephthalic acid is preferably used. In combination with terephthalic acid, other bifunctional carboxylic acid may be used within the range that does not deteriorate the effect of the present invention. For example, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid and decanedicarboxylic acid, and their ester forming derivatives can be used in combination. In general, the amount of the other dicarboxylic acid component compounded should be controlled to not more than 20 mole based on the total dicarboxylic acid. As the glycol component, polyalkylene glycol and ethylene glycol are used in combination. Typical examples of the polyalkylene glycol that can be used are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polytetramethylene glycol, and poly alkyleneoxide α,ω diol such as poly tetramethyleneoxide α,ω diol, and random or block copolymers of ethylene oxide and 1,2 propylene oxide. Of these compounds, polyethylene glycol and polytetramethylene glycol, having an average molecular weight of 300 to 8,000, preferably 400 to 3,000 are particularly suitable.

The glycol component comprises 1 to 65 wt of polyalkylene glycol and 99 to 35 wt of ethylene glycol, and preferably 20 to 60 wt of polyalkylene glycol and 80 to 40 wt of ethylene glycol. If the proportion of the polyalkylene glycol is less than 1 wt , solvent resistance is poor.

If the amount of the component B compounded is less than 4 wt , the solvent resistance of the polycarbonate resin composition is improved only insufficiently. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 45 wt , the impact resistance of the polycarbonate resin composition is seriously decreased. If the amount of the component C compounded is less than 1 wt , the impact resistance and solvent resistance of the polycarbonate resin composition are decreased. On the other hand, if it is in excess of 25 wt , the stiffness of the polycarbonate resin composition is decreased and furthermore the appearance is unsuitably poor.
