# Enzyme containing liquid processing agent used in treatment of light sensitive lithographic printing plates and plate making method.

## Abstract
An enzyme containing liquid processing agent used in treatment of light sensitive lithographic printing plates and a plate making method using this processing agent are described. This processing agent is comprised of a hydrolase and an inorganic salt selected from halides, sulphates, sulfites, hyposulfites, thiocyanates, borates, and phosphates, and has a pH adjusted to from 3 to 8.5. The hydrolase includes carbohydrase amydase, and protease. This processing agent is greatly improved in storage stability that is, the activity of the hydrolase is maintained over long periods of time, such as at least 6 months. Since the processing agent has both a fixing and film removing action on account of the presence of the inorganic salt, it can be used in a plate making method utilizing an automatic developing machine.

## Description
ENZYME CONTAINING LIQUID PROCESSING AGENT USED IN TREATMENT OF LIGHT SENSITIVE LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATES AND PLATE MAKING METHOD The present invention relates to an enzymecontaining liquid processing agent which is greatly improved in stability over time and can be used directly or after dilution. More particularly the present invention relates to an enzyme containing liquid processing agent for use in treatment of a light sensitive lithographic printing plate comprising a support having a hydrophilic surface and at least a silver halide emulsion layer on the support and further to a plate making method using the enzyme containing liquid processing agent. Of enzymes such as hydrolase, oxido reductase, coagulase, or synthetic enzymes, hydrolase e.g., carbohydrase, amidase and protease , in particular, are commercially supplied mainly in the form of powder and applied in the form of a solution in use. Hydrolase is used in, for example, the leather manufacturing industry, fiber industry, and dye industry, and partly as a medicine. In the photographic industry, protease, for example, is used in the recovery of silver. Even in the print industry, as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 25739 81, corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,299,912 , enzymes are used in the process of production of lithographic printing plates The term tOPI as used herein means a published unexamined Japanese patent application Enzymes excluding synthetic enzymes are produced by living cells. The thus produced crude enzymes are extracted and puri ie From an industrial standpoint, it is considered advantageous to use them in the form of a solution as obtained in the extraction purification process without converting them into a powder form.In practice, however, the enzymes are used in the form of powder since their active components have poor storage stability. Further the amount of the active component and its activity can vary. All the enzymes can be said to be proteins or proteins wth specific low molecular compounds bonded thereto. Hence the inherent function and effect of the enzymes are readily deteriorated. Therefore, when making industrial use of the enzymes special techniques should be deviced to avoid their deactivation and variation. In the uses as described above, particularly with the plate making treatment in the photographic industry, it has been a significant subject to develop an enzyme containing processing agent in which the activity of the enzyme can be held over long periods of time so that the enzyme can be supplied automatically to achieve the automatization of the treatment. However, no investigation has been made to improve the storage stability of enzymes contained in such liquid processing agents. An object of the invention is to provide an enzyme containing liquid processing agent in which the activity of the enzyme can be maintained for a long period of time, preferably at least 6 months and more preferably at least one year. Another object of the invention is to provide an enzyme containing liquid processing agent which can be used in the plate making method as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application OPI No 25739 81, and which has both a silver halide fixing action and a filmdissolving action. Still another object of the invention is to provide an automatic replenishment type plate making system utilizing the enzyme containing processing agent as described above. Other objects of the invention will become apparent from the detailed description as described hereinafter. It has been found that the objects can be attained by adding specific inorganic salts to an enzyme containing liquid processing agent and adjusting its pH to 3 to 8.5. The present invention relates to an enzymecontaining liquid processing agent characterized in that it contains an inorganic salt and the pH is adjusted to 3 to 8.5. One of the features of the invention is that the storage stability of enzymes in the form of aqueous solutions are improved. Thus the effect of the invention is markedly exhibited in liquid processing agents containing hydrolases which are very inferior in storage stability. The liquid processing agent of the present invention has a pR adjusted to form 3 to 8.5, and includes hydrolase and at least one inorganic salt. The liquid processing agent may be used for processing a light sensitive lithographic printing plate, by carrying out imagewise exposure, development, enzyme is treatment, light exposure, removal of the emulsion layer and development of non silver light sensitive layer. The light sensitive lithographic printing plate used in connection with the present invention comprises a support having a hydrophilic surface, and a non silver light sensitive layer capable of forming an oleophilic image, and a gelatin silver halide emulsion layer in this sequence on the support Hydrolases used in the present invention include 1 carbohydrases, such as polysaccharase acting on polysaccharide, disatase, cellulase, inulase, pectinase, and lichenase, all acting on the polysaccharide glucosidase and celloviase, acting on the alucocide bond and galactosidase acting on the galactoside group 2 amidases acting on compounds containing an amido group or its derivatives, such as urease, acid amidase, alginase, and aminoacidase 3 esterases which act so as to decompose ester compounds, such as lipase, lecidase, cholesterase, phosphatase, and sulfatase and 4 proteases acting on proteins or their hydrolyzates. These hydrolases are sufficiently soluble in water, and they are used in a concentration of from 0.001 to 108 by weight and preferably from 0.1 to 5 by weight, based on the weight of the prepared liquid processing agent. Inorganic salts which can be used in the present invention are preferably water soluble inorganic salts selected from halides, sulfates, sulfites, hyposulfites, thiocyanates, nitrates, nitrites, phosphates, borates or their similar salts. Of inorganic salts, salts of acids derived from sulfur oxides and bases, thiocyanates, phosphates and borates are more preferable. Cations can be preferably selected from Groups I and II metal ions such as sodium ion, potassium ion, lithium ion, etc , ammonium, and onium ions. These inorganic salts can be used singly or as a mixture comprising two or more thereof. It is suitable for the inorganic salt to be added in such an amount that the concentration of the inorganic salt in the final enzymecontaining liquid processing agent is at least I mole, preferably from 1 to 5 moles, and more preferably from 1 to 3 moles per liter of the liquid processing agent. The enzyme containing liquid processing agent of the present invention is adjusted to from 3 to 8.5 and preferably from 3 to 7.5 in pH. In this pH adjustment, commonly used pH buffers such as acetic acid, acetates, hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride, acidic potassium phthalate, phosphoric acid, boric acid, borates, glycine, and sodium veronal can be used approprIately in comsination with each other. Even in the case of hydrolases, if the inorganic salt as described above is added in a concentration of at least I mole per liter of the solution and the pH is adjusted to the specific range as described above, their storage stability is greatly improved. Another feature of the invention is that if, of the inorganic salts as described above, salts of sulfur oxides such as hyposulfide, sulfite, and sulfate and bases, thiocyanates, phosphates, borates, and so on are added so that the concentration in the final enzyme containing liquid processing agent is at least 1 mole per liter of the liquid processing agent, the deactivation and variation of enzymes are greatly improved and the putrefaction hydrolysis of the enzymes themselves is greatly inhibited, i.e., the storage stability of enzymes is greatly improved, as compared with cases in which the other inorganic salts are added in the same concentration.The addition of the specific inorganic salts as described above further produces the advantages that the enzyme solution is prevented from becoming opaque with a lapse of time, i.e., turbidity is inhibited, and precipitation and discoloration are inhibitec. Another feature of the invention is that of the inorganic salts as used herein, hyposulfite, sulfite, thiocyanate, phosphates, and borates which are used in the developing and fixing processes of a silver halide emulsion layer can be used advantageously particularly in improving the storage stability of an aqueous solution of protease. The optimum light sensitive lithographic printing plate and its plate making method as used in the invention are described in detail, for example, in U.S. Patents, 4,268,609 and 4,299,912, both of which are incorporated by reference. In accordance with this plate making method, a printing plate is produced by a process comprising imagewise exposure, first development of silver halide emulsion layer, fixation, exposure to light, removal of exposed silver halide emulsion layer, seconddevelopment of non silver light sensitive layer, and treatment of the surf ace This series of plate making treatments are nsaly y performed by means of an automatic developing machine. If the enzyme containing liquid processing agent of the invention is used in this plate making method, the fixation and removal of exposed silver halide emulsion layer among the plate making treatments as described above can be performed simultaneously and automatically in the automatic developing machine during the light exposure step. Furthermore, since the enzyme conta4ning liquid processing agent of the invention has good storage stability, it can also be used as a replenishina liquid. Hence the present invention yields various advantages for example, the time required for plate making can be shortened, the automatic developing machine can be miniaturized and simplified, the plate making operation can be rationalized since the processing solution can be automatically replenished, and thus the plate making cost can be reduced. Proteases for use in the enzyme containing processing agent as used in the plate making method of the present invention include ficin, papain, pepsin, and trypsin. Commercially available proteases such as Takaminc HT trade name, produced by Miles Laboratories , Bioplase PN 4 trade name, produced by Nagase Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. ,Pronase P trade name, produced by Kaken Kagaku Co., Ltd. , and Miyapron AF trade name, produced by Teikoku Koso Co., Ltd. can be used. In addition, the proteases as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 36205 70, Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 97738 77, ResearchDisclosure, 15025, British Patents 1,179,769, 1,354,186, U.S. Patents 3,515,551, 3,565,618, 3,620,737, and 3,832,178 can be used.
