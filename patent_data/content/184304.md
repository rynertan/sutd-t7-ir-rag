## Description
METHOD AND SYSTEM OF DRILLING DEVIATED WELLBORES The present invention relates to rotary drilling and, more particularly, to a directional drilling technique for providing deviated wellbores at significantly greater inclinations and or over horizontal distances substantially greater than that currently being achieved by conventional directional drilling practices. The success of such directional drilling should benefit mainly offshore drilling projects as platform costs are a major factor in most offshore production operations.Wellbores with large inclination or horizontal distance offer significant potential for 1 developing offshore reservoirs not otherwise considered to be economical, 2 tapping sections of reservoirs presently considered beyond economical or technological reach, 3 accelerating production by longer intervals in the producing formation due to the high angle holes, 4 requiring fewer platforms to develop large reservoirs, 5 providing an alternative for some subsea completions, and 6 drilling under shipping fairways or to other areas presently unreachable. A number of problems are presented by high angle directional drilling. In greater particularity, hole inclinations of 600 or greater, combined with long sections of hole or complex wellbore profiles present significant problems which need to be overcome. The force of gravity, coefficients of friction, and mud particle settling are the major physical phenomena of concern. In the rotary drilling of a highly deviated wellbore into the earth, a drill string comprised of drill collars and drill pipe is used to advance a drill bit attached to the drill string into the earth to form the wellbore. As the inclination of the wellbore increases, the desired weight on bit for effective drilling from the drill string decreases as the cosine of the inclination angle, and the weight of the drill string lying against the low side of the wellbore increases as the sine of the inclination angle. The force resisting the movement of the drill string along the inclined wellbore is the product of the apparent coefficient of friction and the sum of the forces pressing the string against the wall.At an apparent coefficient of friction of approximately 0.58 for a common water base mud, drill strings tend to slide into the hole from the force of gravity at inclination angles up to approximately 600. At higher inclination angles, the drill strings will not lower from the force of gravity alone, and must be mechanically pushed or pulled, or alternatively, the coefficients of friction can be reduced. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method and system for drilling a deviated wellbore into the earth by rotary drilling wherein a drill string is used to advance a drill bit through the earth and a drilling fluid is circulated down the drill string and returned from the wellbore in the annulus formed about the drill string. A vertical first portion of the wellbore is drilled into the earth from a surface location to a kick off point by rotating and advancing a drill string and drill bit into the earth. A deviated second portion is initiated at the kick off point and is drilled by a drill tool comprised of a drill string, a drill bit, a drill motor, and an extension sub having both contracted and extended positions for providing weight to the drill bit during movement from its contracted to its extended position. The drill tool is positioned so that the drill bit is a predetermined distance above the wellbore bottom. A rapid dynamic movement downward is imparted to the drill tool so that the drill bit impacts the wellbore bottom and places the extension sub in its contracted position. A drilling stroke of the drill bit into the earth below the wellbore bottom is carried out by simultaneously maintaining the drill string stationary, rotating the drill bit under control of the drill motor, and advancing the drill bit under the weight provided by the extension sub in moving from its contracted position to its extended position. Upon completion of the drilling stroke, the drill tool is raised so as to again position the drill bit at the predetermined distance above the wellbore bottom. A new drilling stroke is then initiated. The imparting of downward movement to the drill tool to place the extension sub in the contracted position includes the high speed rotation of the drill string, in the order of 150 revolutions per minute, to take advantage of the compound coefficient of friction principle and the rapid lowering of the drill tool from a distance of about 9.15 meters 30 feet above the wellbore bottom. In a further aspect of the invention, both the drill bit and axial movement of the extension sub in providing weight on the drill bit are angularly directed relative to the axial direction of the wellbore so as to effect a change in the direction of the wellbore. A desired weight on bit is at least 9,080 Kg 20,000 pounds when the extension sub is stroked from its contracted position and at least 7,164 Kg 16,000 pounds when in its fully extended position. In one embodiment, the weight is under spring loaded control.In alternative embodiments, the weight is under hydraulic or compressed gas control. FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of a deviated wellbore extending into the earth and illustrates one embodiment of a rotary drilling tool utilized in the present invention FIG. 2 is a more detailed schematic drawing of the lower portion of the rotary drilling tool of FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic drawing illustrating the drilling pattern of the rotary drilling tool ofFIGS. 1 and 2. This invention is directed to a rotary drilling technique for drilling a deviated wellbore into the earth and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for supplying a desired weight on bit for the effective drilling of the deviated wellbore. In rotary drilling operations, a drill string is employed which is comprised of drill pipe, drill collars, and a drill bit. The drill pipe is made up of a series of joints of seamless pipe interconnected by connectors known as tool joints. The drill pipe serves to transmit rotary torque and drilling mud from a drilling rig to the bit and to form a tensile member to pull the drill string from the wellbore. In normal operations, the drill pipe is always in tension during drilling operations. Drill pipe commonly varies from 8.9 cm 3 1 2 to 12.7 cm 5 in outside diameter.Drill collars are thick walled pipe as compared to drill pipe and thus are heavier per linear foot than drill pipe. The drill collars act as stiff members of the drill string. The drill collars are normally installed in the drill string immediately above the bit and serve to supply weight on the bit. In carrying out rotary drilling techniques, a drilling rig is employed which utilizes a rotary table for applying torque to the top of the drill string to rotate the drill pipe and the drill bit. The rotary drill table also acts as a base stand on which all tubulars, such as drill pipe, drill collars, and casing, are suspended in the hole from the rig floor. A kelly is used as a top tubular member in the drill string and the kelly passes through the rotary table and is acted upon by the rotary table to apply the torque through the drill pipe to the drill bit. Mud pumps are used for circulating drilling fluid or mud intermediate the drilling rig and the bottom of the wellbore. Normally, the drilling fluid is pumped down the drill string and out through the drill bit and is returned to the surface through the annulus formed about the drill pipe. The drilling fluid serves such purposes as removing earth cuttings made by the drill bit from the wellbore, cooling the bit, and lubricating the drill pipe to lessen the energy required in rotation. In completing the well, casing is normally run thereinto and is cemented for the purpose of sealing and maintaining the casing in place. In the drilling of a deviated wellbore, there may preferably be drilled a vertical first portion of the wellbore into the earth s crust from surface location to a kick off point at about the lower end of the first portion by rotating and advancing a drill string and drill bit into the earth s crust. A deviated second portion of the wellbore is initiated at the kick off point. Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a wellbore 1 having a vertical first portion 3 that extends from the surface 5 of the earth to a kick off point 7 and a deviated second portion 9 of the wellbore which extends from the kick off point 7 to the wellbore bottom 11. A shallow or surface casing string 13 is shown in the wellbore surrounded by a cement sheath 15. A drill string 17, having a drill bit 19 at the lower end thereof, is shown in the wellbore 1. The drill string 17 is comprised of drill pipe 21 and the drill bit 19, and will normally include drill collars not shown .The drill pipe 21 is comprised of joints of pipe that are interconnected together by either conventional or eccentric tool joints 25, in the vertical first portion3 of the wellbore extending in the open hole portion thereof below the casing 13 as well as in the deviated second portion 9 of the wellbore. The tool joints 25 in the deviated second portion 9 of the wellbore rest on the lower side 27 of the wellbore and support the drill pipe 21 above the lower side 27 of the wellbore. In drilling of the deviated wellbore, drilling fluid not shown is circulated down the drill string 17, out of the drill bit 19, and returned via the annulus 29 of the wellbore to the surface 5 of the earth. Drill cuttings formed by the breaking of the earth by the drill bit 19 are carried by the returning drilling fluid in the annulus 29 to the surface of the earth. These drill cuttings not shown tend to settle along the lower side 27 of the wellbore about the drill pipe 21. The eccentric tool joints 25 resting on the lower side 27 of the wellbore support the drill pipe 21 above most of these cuttings. During drilling operations, the drill string 17 is rotated and the rotation of the eccentric tool joints 25 causes the drill pipe 21 to be eccentrically moved in the wellbore.This movement of the drill pipe 21 tends to sweep the drill cuttings not shown from the lower side of the wellbore 27 into the main stream of flow of the returning drilling fluid in the annulus 29, and in particular into that part of the annulus which lies around the upper side of the drill pipe 21, where they are better carried by the returning drilling fluid to the surface of the earth. Maintaining the desired weight on the drill bit 19 is a serious problem in drilling high angle wellbores. For example, a drill collar, laying in an 800 deviated wellbore with a zero coefficient of friction has only 17 of its weight available for pushing on the drill bit. A 0.2 coefficient of friction might be expected with oil mud on a sliding smooth surface. At this coefficient of friction, the drill collar will not slide from the force of gravity into the 800 wellbore and will not add any weight to the drill bit. The actual apparent coefficient of friction in the axial direction will most likely be greater than 0.2 with a non rotating drill string, and, by the principle of compound coefficient of friction, be between 0.0 and 0.2 for a rotating drill string.The edges of the non rotating tool joints and any stabilizers will dig into the wellbore wall, thereby increasing the apparent coefficient of friction in the axial direction. An even greater problem will be maintaining weight on bit when directionally drilling with a mud motor without rotation of the drilling string since the drill string will provide no weight to the drill bit. It is, therefore, a specific feature of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for providing such weight on bit when drilling with a mud motor and a stationary drill string. FIG. 2 illustrates such apparatus in detail. Located between the lowermost drill collar 26 and the drill bit 19 are the measuring while drilling sub 30, the mud motor 31 and the extension sub 32. Such extension sub 32 is the immediate source of weight on the drill bit 19. It can be powered by hydraulic pressure, compressed gas, mechanical springs, or the like. The extension sub is placed in a contracted position i.e., compressed by a rapid dynamic movement downward of the entire drill string 17 by such action as a high speed rotation, a movement downward from an elevated position, or both simultaneously, until the drill bit 19 strikes the wellbore bottom.On commencement of drilling, the drill bit 19 is advanced or stroked under the weight from the compressed extension sub 32 while the drill string remains stationary. At the end of the drilling stroke, when the extension sub is fully extended from its contracted position at the start of the stroke, there is an end of stroke indication, for example, a mud pressure increase or decrease. The entire drill string is then drawn up the wellbore and the drill bit repositioned above the wellbore bottom. The procedure is then repeated with the drill string being lowered to compress the extension sub and the drilling stroke being thereafter again completed. In one example, the drill string is pulled upward until the drill bit is about 9.15 meters 30 feet above wellbore bottom. The mud circulation is stopped and the drill string rotation is increased to about 150 rpm.A rapid lowering of the rotating drill string is then initiated to compress the extension sub 32. It is preferred that the compressed extension sub be able to advance the drill bit at least 0.61 1.22 m 2 to 4 feet during each drilling stroke with no drill string advancement. This is accomplished by a soft spring extension sub delivering 9,080 Kg 20,000 pounds of weight to the drill bit in the compressed state and 7,164 Kg 16,000 pounds in the extended state. Use of a compressed gas cylinder would be comparable to use of the soft spring in the extension sub. In a further embodiment, a hydraulic cylinder similar to the conventional hydraulic drill collar, but without the shoe reaction against the wellbore wall, could be used as the extension sub. Pump pressure would then cause the extension sub to put weight on the drill bit. For all embodiments of the extension sub, the axial wellbore force reaction to each drilling stroke is the frictional resistance of the drill string against the wellbore wall. Further, it is not necessary that the extension sub 32 be located between the mud motor 31 and drill bit 19 as shown in FIG. 2. It could be located between the mud motor 31 and the measuring while drilling sub 30 or, it could be located between the measuring while drilling sub 30 and the lowermost drill collar 26. Use of the present invention will be particularly advantageous when changing the direction of a high angle wellbore. The greatest problem in such high angle wellbores is providing the desired weight on bit when rotating only with the mud motor, the drill string remaining stationary. In this situation, a bent sub 33 is located above the mud motor 31 as shown in FIG. 3. To change wellbore direction, the rotation of drill string 17 is stopped, the orientation of the bent sub 33 is set to redirect the drill bit 19 in the desired change of direction, and the rotation of the drill bit 19 continued through only the drill motor 31. This effects a change in the direction of the wellbore from the straight path. When the desired directional change has been completed, as indicated by the measurring while drilling sub 30, the rotation of the drill string 17 is restarted. FIG. 3 illustrates diagrammatically such a change in direction of the second deviated portion 9 of the wellbore. When both the drill string 17 and drill bit 19 are rotated, the borehole follows the direction of the straight path 40 with the borehole size being shown by the dashed lines 42. Preferably, the drill string is rotated at relatively slow speed sufficient to both maintain a straight path and to minimize friction loss from dragging of the drill string along the lower side of the wellbore. Such rotational speed may be in the range of 10 to 25 revolutions per minute, for example. However, slower or faster speeds may also be sufficient. During a change in direction, the drill string is held stationary with the bent sub oriented as indicated by the dashed lines 43.The weight on bit is supplied by extension sub 32 such that drilling by the mud motor 31 follows the path 41 with the initial borehole size as shown by the dashed lines 44.Following such direction change, the drill string 17 is again rotated and the borehole of the size shown by dashed lines 42 continues in the new direction 41. Since such a change in wellbore direction is to be effected without rotation of drill string 17, the weight on the drill bit 19 would drill off immediately and bit advancement would stop without the immediate force of the extension sub 32 on the drill bit 19 since the available weight on bit from the drill string is generally not sufficient for high angle wellbores. For example, an alternative to the use of the bent sub 33 for angularly displacing the axis of rotation of the drill bit 19 from that of the drill string is the use of a bent housing for the drill motor 31. A further alternative is the offsetting of the axis of the drive shaft of the drillmotor 31. Another alternative is the use of non concentric stabilizers on the drill motor 31. In only two degrees from an inclination of 800 to 820 with a 0.1 effective coefficient of friction the available bit weight from a drill collar can decrease by one half from a factor of 0.075 to 0.040 . In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, the bent sub 30 provides a deviation angle 0 of 1 4 from the vertical axis of the drill string 17 and is in the order of 1.05 m 3 1 2 feet in length. With a distance of about 9.15 m 30 feet from the bottom of the wellbore to the deviating point of the bent sub 33 and an angle of deviation 0 of 1 40, a drilling offset d of about 3.81 cm 1 1 2 inches is provided from the center line of the wellbore as shown in FIG. 3. Other angles of deviation may be selected to provide varying drilling offsets. Suitable angles are from about 1 80 to about 1 20 at distances of 9.15 m 30 feet to 3.05 m 10 feet to the deviating point of the bent sub 30. Drill bit 19 is a 30.12 cm 12 1 4 inch bit. Drill motor 31 is 19.68 cm 7 3 4 inch Delta 1000 mud motor supplied by Dyna Drill Co. ofIrvine, California, and which is 7.35 m 24 1 2 feet in length. The measuring while drilling system 30 can be of the types supplied by The Analyst Schlumberger ofHouston, Texas Gearhart Industries of Fort Worth,Texas Teleco Oil Field Services of Meriden, Connecticut orExploration Logging of Sacramento, California.
