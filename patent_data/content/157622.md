## Description
IMPROVED CLAMPING DEVICE This invention relates to a clamping device for use in securing an article to a supporting structure.The device is an improved version of the clamping device described in our British patent specification 159087lit. The specification of patent 1590874 describes a clamping device in which a pair of hollow end members are slidably mounted into respective ends of a central hollow member, a long bolt and associated nut being used to screw each end member into and out of the central member, thus allowing the distance between the free ends of the end members to be adjusted. Each free end is provided with a fixed upstanding bracket, which brackets can thus be moved towards and away from one another and thus provides respective clamping surfaces which can clamp articles in the manner of the jaws of a vice. The clamping device can be used for any article, but finds particular application in the support of domestic articles such as television sets,Hi Fi s or microwave ovens. According to the present invention there is provided a clamping device for securing an article to a supporting structure, said clamping device comprising a tubular main beam adapted at its midpoint for attachment to the supporting structure, two auxiliary beams each slidably mounted within a respective portion of the main beam which extends between its midpoint and its free end, locking means disposed on the main beam for independently locking each auxiliary beam with respect to the main beam and respective clamping means mounted on each auxiliary beam in such a way as to clamp respective opposite faces of the article to be supported, each of said clamping means comprising a clamping jaw member having a forward face adapted to engage the article to be supported, and a rear face and means for adjustably mounting the clamping jaw member on its respective auxiliary beam in order to provide fine positional adjustment of said clamping jaw member with respect to the article to be secured. In a preferred embodiment each clamping jaw member is mounted for rotation about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of its respective auxiliary beam. A preferred feature of the invention is that each clamping jaw member is formed with a through slot which is elongate in a direction normal to the plane of the forward face of the respective clamping jaw, and a hole extending from the rear face of said clamping jaw member through the slot in the elongate direction, the clamping means further comprising a pin in which is disposed a threaded hole, said pin extending through the slot and being mounted on its respective auxiliary beam, and screw means extending through the hole in the clamping jaw member and meshing with the threaded hole in such a way as to urge the clamping jaw member into and out of a gripping engagement with the article upon respectively tightening and loosening of the screw means. One embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of an example. The description makes reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which Figure 1 is a front elevation of an embodiment of a clamping device according to the invention Figure 2 is a view from below the device ofFigure 1 Figure 3 is a plan view of one of the clamping jaw members used in the embodiment of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a side elevation of one of the pins used in the embodiment of Figure 1 and Figure 5 is a cross section of one of the auxiliary beams, taken on the line VV of Figure 1. Referring to the drawings, the clamping device 10 comprises a tubular main beam 12 of square crosssection to which is attached at its midpoint a depending stud 13 having a threaded end by which the device may be pivotally mounted on a supporting structure not shown . The device is normally mounted in such a way as to enable it to swivel about the stud 13 although it could also be mounted in various other ways including in a fixed mode, in work trolleys or stands. Slidably mounted within the main beam 12 are a pair of auxiliary beams 14. Towards each end of the main beam 12 there are provided auxiliary beam locking means 17 which comprise grub screw sockets 18 which are welded to the main beam 12. The main beam 12 has holes which correspond to the sockets 18 and which permit the insertion of grub screws. Tightening of said grub screws causes their abutment against the auxiliary beams 14 thereby securing said auxiliary beams 14 against the main beam 12. To the outer end of each auxiliary beam 14 is attached a respective upstanding portion in the form of a length 15 of similar tubular material attached vertically to the auxiliary beam, for example by welding.Clamping means 11 are mounted at the free end of each upstanding portion 15. Both clamping means 11 are identical and each comprises a clamping jaw member 20, a pin 21 and a screw means 31. Only one such clamping means shall be described below. The clamping jaw member 20 has a forward face to which are attached two gripping pads 22 which are made from a resilient material, said gripping pads being adapted to abut the respective face of the article to be secured. The surface 23 between the pads 22 is concave in form and can accommodate any slight irregularities in the shape of the articles to be held.Midway between the pads 22 is a through slot 24 which extends in the direction of the upstanding portions 15 and which is elongate in a direction normal to the plane of the forward face of the respective clamping jaw. The jaw member 20 also has a countersunk hole 25 extending from a rear surface 30 of the jaw member through the slot in the elongate direction. The pin 21 has a head 26 at one end, an annular groove 28 at the other end, said groove being tapered towards the head 26, and a threaded hole 27 extending laterally through the pin at a position near the head 26. The pin 21 extends through the slot 24 in such a way that the end of the pin incorporating the annular groove 28 projects into the free end of the respective upstanding portion 15. An inwardly directed tongue 29, which is formed in the upstanding portion, is pressed towards the pin. The tongue 29 engages the annular groove 28 in order to retain the pin 21. The pin is rotatable within the upstanding portion 15 about its lengthwise axis and each clamping jaw member 20 can therefore be oriented in order to accommodate articles having non parallel sides. The screw means 31 is placed into the hole 25 from its end opening into the rear face 30 and is threadedly engaged with the threaded hole 27 in the pin. The screw means is tightened until the head of the screw means engages the countersunk surface of the hole 25 with the pin positioned at the left hand end of the slot 24, when seen in Figure 3. Further tightening of the screw means urges the pin to the other end of the slot thus moving the clamping jaw member 20 forwards and causing the pads 22 to move towards the article to be secured. The loosening of the screw means will urge the pin back towards the left hand end of the slot thus moving the clamping jaw member 20 backwards and in turn causing the pads 22 to release their grip on the article. The device is used by first obtaining an approximate position of the clamping means 11 by loosening the grub screws 19 and sliding the auxiliary beams 14 until the pads 22 abut the article on each side and thence tightening the grub screws 19. Secure clamping of the article is subsequently obtained by tightening the screw means and thus urging the gripping pads 22 of the clamping jaw members 20 into firm contact with the article.
