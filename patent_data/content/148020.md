# STRIP PACKAGING

## Abstract
The invention relates to strip packaging, in particular to a child resistant strip package. The package of the invention comprises a plurality of packaged elements each individually enclosed between a first sheet comprising a material which is tear resistant and which will not easily permit release of an element by tearing or application of pressure, and a second sheet adhered thereto and comprising a material which retains the ele ments but which is sufficiently frangible to permit release of an element by applicatication of finger pressure to the element through the first sheet. The package is manufactured by a method comprising continuously feeding a web of said first sheet material and a web of said second sheet material to a packaging station. There the webs are disposed essentially vertically and a plurality of elements to be packaged are fed between the webs. The webs are then sealed together to form pockets around and to enclose the elements as one or more rows between the webs.
