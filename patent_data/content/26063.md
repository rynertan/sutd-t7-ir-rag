# Device for supplying parts to and for removing parts from a machining station.

## Abstract
An automatic loading and unloading device 10 that can be used for high production machinery utilizes straight through feeding of workpieces 78 across a shuttle table 16 to a machining station and through the machining station to a discharge chute 70 , minimising jamming of the pieces 78 . In addition, the device 10 simultaneously indexes new workpieces 78 on the shuttle table 16 by means of a load ing unloading assembly 14 while previous workpieces 78 are being machined. The device 10 can also be used for supplying and indexing workpieces 78 on a batch basis rather than an individual workpiece basis.
