## Description
The invention relates to a carriage assembly for linearly reciprocating a data converter to a desired target position by linearly reciprocating a carriage. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional carriage assembly as described in Japanese Pat. Appln. No. 57 93897. The carriage assembly shown in Fig. 1 includes a carriage 11 on which a pickup 12 is mounted outer case yokes 13 of magnetic circuits constituting fixed side driving sources permanent magnets 14 fixed to, for instance, the outer case yokes 13 center pole pieces 15 of the fixed side driving sources installed on both sides of the carriage 11 for driving the carriage 11, the fixed side driving sources including the outer case yokes 13, the permanent magnets 14, and the center pole pieces 15 movable side coil bobbins 16 on which driving coils 17 are wound, the movable elements including the carriage 11, the pickup 12, coil bobbins 16, and the coils 17 bearings 18a and 18b for supporting the movable elements and guide rails 19a and 19b. The operation of this carriage assembly is as follows The outer case yokes 13 on both sides of the carriage 11, the permanent magnets 14, and the center pole pieces 15 constitute magnetic circuits, the direction of the magnetic field produced thereby pointing in the directions Y and Z indicated in Fig. 2. The coil 17 passes across the magnetic field formed by the magnetic circuit, whereas the current flows in the direction Z against the direction Y of the magnetic field and in the direction Y against the direction Z of the magnetic field. Consequently, the driving force acts in the direction X indicated in Fig. 2. When a target position on a disk has been determined, current is made to flow through the coils 17 in response to instructions from a control unit not shown , and the carriage 11 is controlled by the driving force so as to move to the target position. Subsequently, the carriage supporting structure will be described. Two pairs of bearings 18a, namely, two bearings in front and in rear, are attached to the bottom of the carriage 11, extending generally in the direction of carriage movement with axis of the bearing 18a lying at a certain angle to the XY plane in Fig. 2 and the pair of left and right hand bearings 18a being respectively inclined in directions opposite to each other. As the bearings 18a are pressed against the guide rail 19a, they restrain the rotational moments of the carriage 11 around the Y and Z axes and its transverse and downward movement. Moreover, the bearings 18b, attached to both sides of the carriage 11 and pressed against the guide rails 19b installed on both sides of the carriage 11, restrain rotational movement of the carriage 11 around the X axis and upward movement of the carriage 11. Consequently, the movable elements make smooth linear reciprocal movements in only the longitudinal direction the X direction . In the conventional carriage assembly thus constructed, as three guide rails 19a, 19b and 19b and two pairs of fixed side driving sources are required to reciprocate the carriage 11 linearly and smoothly, the width of the assembly is relatively great, as seen in Fig. 3. Also, there are problems such as high production costs because both the number of parts and the number of assembly steps are high. Moreover, the guide rails 19a installed on the bottom of the carriage 11 and the coils 17 on both sides thereof make the total height and width of the overall assembly great. US A 4 39 34 25 describes an actuator for linearly moving magnetic heads in which an open ended carriage assembly extends down both sides of the magnet structure in order to provide a short actuator assembly. The loading mechanism is not mounted upon the carriage assembly. The magnet structure is in the shape of an E with the motor coil, which is mounted across the open end of the carriage assembly, moving along this center section of the magnet structure. Alignment pins are located at the other end of the carriage assembly. The rollers for the carriage are mounted on the outside and located approximately in the middle thereof. The guide rails are therefore mounted outside the carriage similar to the abovementioned prior art carriage assembly. The present invention is intended to solve the above described problems, and it is therefore an object of the invention to provide a compact carriage assembly employing only a small number of parts. Specifically, it is an object of the invention to provide a more compact carriage assembly by reducing the weight of the moving elements to thus decrease the driving force and thus power consumption of the carriage assembly. The object of the present invention is solved by a carriage assembly for linearly reciprocating a data converter to move said data converter to a desired target position by linearly reciprocating a carriage, a driving coil wound on a transversely solid type coil bobbin, guide rails forming guides for said linear reciprocal movement, a plurality of rollers for supporting on said guide rails the moving elements comprising said carriage, said coil bobbin and said driving coil so that said moving elements can make only said linear reciprocal movement along said guide rails characterized in that left and right hand magnetic circuits are provided on opposite sides of the said carriage, said driving coil is formed in such a manner as to be magnetically linked with each of said magnetic circuits, and said driving coil and said bobbin surround said carriage and said guiderails said guide rails being provided in respective spaces between both sides of said carriage and said coil bobbin. With the inventive arrangement of the rollers relative to the guide rails, only the guide rails on the two sides of the carriage are used to restrain rotational movement of the carriage around the X, Y and Z axes and its transverse and vertical movement. Consequently, stable linear reciprocal movement of the carriage along the guide rails is attained and, by thus controlling the movement of the carriage, a data converter can be quickly and accurately brought to a target position. Further, in a carriage assembly according to the present invention, guide rails for guiding a carriage are installed between the carriage and the center pole pieces of left and right hand magnetic circuits. With the guide rails for guiding the carriage installed between the carriage and the center pole pieces, the carriage and the driving coil can be made compact and lightweight, whereby the carriage can be linearly reciprocated with a small driving force.

Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of a carriage assembly of the present invention. In Fig. 4, the carriage assembly includes a carriage 1 on which a pickup 2 is mounted, outer case yokes 3 constituting fixed side driving sources, permanent magnets 4 fixed to the outer case yokes 3, center pole pieces 5 incorporated in the outer case yokes 3 and forming parts of the magnetic circuits, and a movable side coil bobbin 6 having a transversely solid form, a driving coil 7 being wound on the coil bobbin 6. The coil bobbin 6 on which the coil 7 is wound is magnetically linked with each of the magnetic circuits on either side and surrounds the carriage 1. The carriage 1, the pickup 2, the coil bobbin 6, and the coil 7 constitute moving elements. The carriage assembly further includes roller bearings 8a, 8b and 8c supporting the moving elements, the bearings 8a and 8b being respectively provided at both ends of the carriage 1 and extending in a plane at a fixed radial angle with respect to its direction of movement, and the bearings 8c being provided midway between respective pairs of the bearings 8a and 8b and extending at a fixed angle different from that of the angle of the bearings 8a and 8b and guide rails 9 installed in spaces between both sides of the carriage 1 and the bobbin 6. The configuration of the coil bobbin 6 will be described. The coil bobbin 6 is of a transversely solid type, square shaped in cross section, and constructed so as to pass through the magnetic circuits on both sides of the carriage 1 and through the carriage 1 and to surround the carriage 1. The reason for this arrangement of the transversely solid type coil bobbin 6 is that, because the breadth W₁ in the case of a conventional transversely separate type bobbin is, as shown in Fig. 3 The support structure for the moving elements will be described. As shown in Fig. 5, two guide rails on both sides of the carriage 1 are used to restrain the moving elements. As shown in Fig. 12, the front and rear bearings 8a and 8b are attached on both sides of the carriage 1, extending at a certain angle to the XY plane. Each bearing 8c is placed midway between the bearings 8a and 8b at a position so as to sandwich the guide rail 9 and is oriented at an angle opposite that of the bearings 8a and 8b with respect to the XY plane. The guide rail 9 is pressed against the bearings 8a to 8c installed on both sides of the carriage 1 to complete the support structure. Another arrangement of bearings will be described with reference to Figs. 13 a and 13 b . In this arrangement, two pairs of bearings 8a 8 and 8b 8 are attached on one side of the carriage. On the other hand, a pair of bearings 8c 8 are attached on the other side of the carriage at a position facing a mid portion between the two pairs of bearings 8a 8 and 8b 8 . The carriage assembly thus constructed makes the following possible The position of the guide rails will be described next. As shown in Fig. 4, the center pole pieces 5 pass between the carriage 1 and the coil bobbin 6. If the thickness t of each center pole piece 5 is less than that of the coil bobbin 6, there will be a region above the center pole piece 5. Accordingly, space is saved by passing the guide rail 9 through this region. Moreover, unwanted vibration is also prevented because the support structure is located close to the carriage 1 and thus is capable of directly supporting the carriage 1 so that stable, smooth, linear reciprocal movement is effected. Comparison results between a conventional carriage assembly using a transversely separate type coil bobbin and a carriage assembly of the present invention using a transversely solid type coil bobbin, will be described. Frequency response was measured by using a carriage assembly shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 11 shows the result of the measurement. The operation of the carriage assembly will be described. When the target position of a disk is determined, current is caused to flow through the coil 7 by instructions from a control unit not shown . On receiving a longitudinal driving force, the moving element supported by the above described support structure makes a smooth linear reciprocal movement and reaches a target position. Positioning is thus completed. Although the two guide rails 9 on both sides of the carriage 1 are used to restrain rotation around the Y and Z axes, in the above described embodiment, only one of the guide rails may be used for the purpose of such restraint and the other used for bearing the weight of the carriage 1. Although description has been given of a support structure using roller type bearings, the guide rails may be supported by sliding bearings made of a smooth material such as fluoroplastics. As set forth above, the carriage assembly according to the present invention includes a drive coil wound on a transversely solid type coil bobbin formed in such a manner as to be magnetically linked with each of the magnetic circuits formed on both sides of a carriage and to surround the carriage, guide rails provided in spaces between both sides of the carriage and the coil bobbin, and a plurality of rollers for supporting the moving element between both ends in the carriage travel direction and both transversal ends thereof so that the moving elements can undergo only a linear reciprocal movement. The present invention consequently provides a compact and inexpensive apparatus capable of smooth linear reciprocal movement with a small number of parts while requiring fewer assembly steps. Fig. 7 is a perspective view of a second embodiment of a carriage assembly of the present invention. In Fig. 7, the carriage assembly includes a carriage 31 on which, for example, a pickup 32 is mounted, outer case yokes 33 constituting fixed side driving sources, permanent magnets 34 fixed to, for instance, the outer case yokes 33, center pole pieces 35 incorporated in the outer case yokes 33 and constituting the magnetic circuits, and a movable side coil bobbin 36 having a transversely solid form, a driving coil 37 being wound on the coil bobbin 36. The coil bobbin 36 on which the coil 37 is wound is magnetically linked with each of the magnetic circuits on either side and surrounds the carriage 31. The carriage 31, the pickup 32, the coil bobbin 36, and the coil 37 constitute moving elements. The carriage assembly further includes bearings rollers 38 supporting the moving element, three of the bearings 38 being arranged on both sides of upper and lower parts of the carriage 31. The bearings contact the guide rails 39 arranged between the carriage 31 and the center pole pieces 35 at a fixed angle to the guide rails 39, whereby the bearings support and allow the carriage 31 to undergo linear reciprocal movement while restraining its movement in the vertical and transverse directions. Subsequently, the relation among the carriage 31, the center pole pieces 35, the coil bobbin 36, and the guide rails 39 will be described. Fig. 8 is a sectional view of the second embodiment of the present invention of Fig. 7. As seen in Fig. 8, the guide rails 39 are installed between the carriage 31 and the center pole pieces 35, and the center pole piece 35 has an appropriate cross sectional area. Moreover, the portion of the center pole piece confronting the guide rails 39 and the bearings 38 is in a concave shape to minimize the breadth of the coil bobbin 36. The bearings 38 are attached on both sides of the carriage 31 in the same manner to the arrangement shown in Fig. 12 or 13. The vertical dimension of the carriage 31 can be reduced to a minimum gap between the center pole piece 35 and the coil bobbin 36. The distance c between the center pole piece 35 designates a minimum dimension necessary for the carriage 31 having a convex shape to undergo a linear reciprocal movement between the center pole pieces 35. In Fig. 8, sections corresponding to those of Fig. 5 are also represented by a, b, c, e, f, g₁ and h, whereas the breadth of the center pole piece 35 is represented by d₁ and the height of the bobbin by H₁. Subsequently, the configuration of the coil bobbin 36 will be described. As shown in Fig. 5, the vertical dimension H₂ of the coil bobbin 6 of the first embodiment of Fig. 5 is given by The operation of the carriage assembly according to this embodiment of the present invention will be described. The outer case yokes 33, the permanent magnets 34, and the center pole pieces 35 installed on both sides of the carriage constitute magnetic circuits. The direction of the current in the driving coil points in the direction Z against the direction Y of the magnetic field formed by the magnetic field of the magnetic circuit. Accordingly, a driving force acts in the X direction. Current flows through the driving coil 37 in response to instructions from a control unit not shown when the target position of a disk is determined. Then, the carriage 31 is controlled by the driving force so as to move to the target position. The driving force F The power constant is given by The power consumption P is expressed by Fig. 9 shows comparison results between embodiments having various arrangements of the guide rails. As is apparent from Fig. 9, the embodiment in which the guide rail is positioned inside the center yoke, is most preferable. The present invention has advantages as follows As set forth above, a compact lightweight carriage assembly is provided because its guide rails are installed between the carriage and the respective central magnetic poles. For that reason, it is possible to reduce the space required for the overall carriage assembly installation. Also, the required power is reduced.
