# Method of making and using novel scale inhibiting terpolymer.

## Abstract
A two step process is disclosed for preparing an essen tially non crosslinked random copolymer of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with esters of the acids which esters are formed by reaction with an alkylene oxide. Raw materials are meth acrylic acid and alkylene oxide. In a first step, a pre determined amount of a particular esterification catalyst is used, and with close control of process conditions, the meth acrylic acid yields both mono and polyalkoxylated esters. In the second step polymerization is effected without separating the esterification catalyst or purifying the esters formed. The resulting random copolymer formed consists essentially of a terpolymer of i acrylic acid or methacrylic acid together meth acrylic ii a hydroxymonoalkylated meth acrylate, and iii a hydroxypolyalkyleneoxylated meth acrylate the monomeric moieties being present in specified relative proportions. Despite the presence of the polyalkyleneoxylated ester moiety the terpolymer is soluble in water, and is surprisingly effective in the treatment of industrial process water used in recirculating water systems.
