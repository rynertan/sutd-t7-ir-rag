## Description
MICROBIAL EXPRESSION OF TYPE I TRANSFORMING GROWTHFACTOR, POIYPEPTXDE ANALOGS THEREOF AND HYBRID EGF TGFPOLYPEPTIDES BACKGROUND The present invention relates generally to the manlpulation of genetic materials and, more particularly, to the manufacture of specific DNA sequences useful in recombinant procedures to secure the microbial expression of Transforming Growth Factor, of polypeptide analogs thereof, and of hybrid polypeptides comprising portions of the sequence of amino acid residues of TransformingGrowth Factor. Ordinarily, normal mammalian cells including cells explanted from tissue or cell lines only grow in monolayers and will not grow in oft agar because the cells require a solid support to which they can attach,However, tile transformed phenotype, i.e., less of density dependent inhibition of cell grolr In monolayer culture, overgrowth in monolayer culture, characteristic change in cellular morphology and acquiisition of anchorage independent Growth, can be conferred on normal mammalian cells by one or more members of a family of mammalian polypeptide growth factors, Transforming Growth Factors TGFs . Polypeptides with the properties of TGFs have been secreted by and partially purified from tumor cells of different origins, e.g., rat embryo fibroblasts transforned by murine leukemia virus Twardzik, D.R., et al.,Science, 216, 894 897 1982 1 cells of the human metastatic melanoma cell line A2058 Marquardt, H., et al.,J.Biol.Chem., 257, 5220 5225 1982 and, Moloney urine sarcoma virus infected mouse 3T3 cells Detarco, J., et al., J.Biol.Chem., 255, 3685 3690 1980 3. Intracellular forms of TGFs have also been detected in tumor cells in culture and in vivo Roberts, A., et al.,PNAS USA , 77, 3494 3498 1980 . TGFs have been classified into several categories on the basis of their biological and physical properties. The only category of TGF which has been characterized to an appreciable degree is referred to as Type I TGF alternately TGF a, eTGP, or EGF like TGF .In addition to promoting growth of tumor cells, having the ability to reversibly induce a transformed phenotype in normal fibroblasts and epithelial cells when grown in tissue culture, Type I TGF competes with epidermal growth factor EGF for binding to cellular EGF receptors.Marquardt, H., et al., PNAS USA, 80 4684 4688 1983 . Type I TGF is functionally related to epidermal growth factor EGF , urogastrone and shares several common properties. It is approximately the same size as EGF, having about fifty amino acids and an estimated molecular weight of 7,400 daltons determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel. Like EGF, Type I TGF has six cysteines in positions analogous to those in EGF which form three disulfide bridges. See, Marguardt,J.Biol.Chem., supra, at 52241. Unlike EGF, however, Type I TGF is found in cell lines with the transformed phenotype, while EGF is found only in non transformed cell types. Type I TGF expression, unlike that of EGF, appears to be correlated with the expression of an active oncogene. At the filing date November 1, 1983 of applicants above identified parent applicatiÏn, amino acid sequences for Type I TGF isolated from cell lines established from solid tumors in mice, rats and humans were only partially identified in the literature. Portions of the polypeptides for which sequences were published were determined to be nearly identical, with all identified residues in mouse and rat Type I TGF being identical through amino acid number 40. Marquardt, et a11, PNAS USA, supra at 46861, until recently, the human Type I TGF sequence was incomplete at least two variations from mouse and rat Type I TGF within the first 34 amino acids were known and four other residues were only tentatively identified the sequence beyond position number 34 was unknown .The complete human Type I TGF sequence was disclosed byDerynk, et al., Cell, 38 287 297 August 1984 , and is set out below. 1 5 10Val Val Ser Sis Phe Aan Asp Cys Pro Asp Ser His Thr 15 20 25Gln Phe Cys Phe His Gly Thr Cys Arg Phe Leu Val Gln 30 35Glu Asp Lys Pro Ala Cys Val Cys His Ser Gly Tyr Val 40 45 50Gly Ala Arg Cys Glu His Ala Asp Leu Leu Ala A partial amino acid sequence for rat Type ITGF was reported by Marquardt, et a11, PNAS USA, 80z 4684 4688 1983 , which provided the sequence up to amino acid residue 43, with no residues identified at positions 26, 30, 40 and 42. LRood and his co investigators at the California Institute of Technology reported the identity of the amino acid residues at 26, 30, 36, 40 and 42 and generation of the remaining sequence from amino as 44 to 50 in September 1983. The complete ratType I TGF sequence was thereafter presented during theEleventh Conference on Cell Proliferation and Cancer, entitled the Cancer Cell , held at Cold Spring HarborLaboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, New York, on September 8 13, 1983, by George J. Todaro in the 1Growth Factors segment of the conference.The more recent publication by Marquardt, et al., Science, 223 1079 1082 1984 sets out the complete sequence below 1 5 10 val Val Ser His Pbe Asn tys Cys Pro Asp Ser His Thr 15 20 25 Gin Tyr Cys Phe His Gly Thr Cys Arg Phe Leu Val Gln 30 35 Giu Glu Lys Pro Ala Cys Val Cys His Ser Gly Tyr Val 40 45 50Gly Val Arg Cys Glu His Ala Asp Leu Leu Ala If available in large quantities in biologically active form, Type T TGF of the sequences noted above as well as polypeptide analogs thereof would have a number of clinical and research uses. Type I TGF could be employed to raise antibodies, useful in diagnostic tests, e.g., RIAs, to detect or characterize the presence of malignant tumors which secrete Type I TGF, or to potentially aid in the immunization of animals against establisment or progression of such tumors. The amino acid sequence for rat Type I TGF is sufficiently homologous to the human Type I TGF sequence l.e., 92 homology that antibodies to rat Type z TGF are expected to cross react with human Type I TGF. Thus, human tissue, blood or urine could b screened for the presence Of malignant tumors employing antibodies to rat Type t TGF.Similarly, synthetic production of large quantities of Type I TGF could permit the development of a general screen for the detection of subclinical tumors and a method for .,onitoring treatment efficacy in patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Further, when employed as an additive to cell culture media Type I TGF has potential utility in promoting growth of refractive cell types and may potentially have the capacity to permit growth of large cell oultures in vitro for a variety of medical or research purposes. As an example, one potential use for Type I TGF and polypeptide analogs thereof could be to replaceEGF as a constituent in media designed to stimulate growth of large cultures of epithelial cells for skin grafts and the like twee, Teao, M., et al., J.Cell.Phys., 110 219 229 1982 1, Additionally, tests are currently ongoing to find ways to take advantage of the common properties ofEGF and Type I TGF to maximize their therapeutic potential, i.e., to improve healing of severe wounds, and the like. See, e.g., Chemical Week, Sept. 28, 1983, pages 40 481. Application of recombinant DNA techniques to production of human EGF has been the subject of substantial investigation by applicants. The manufacture of genes coding for microbial expression of EGF and EGF analogs is described in their co owned, co pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 486,091, entitled TheManufacture and Expression of Genes Coding for Urogastrone and Polypeptide Analogs Thereof , filed April 25, 1983y and the disclosures of said application are specifically incorporated by reference herein. See also,European Patent Application No. 0 046 039 publishedFebruary 17, 1982. Thus far Type I TGF has been isolated from tumors of a variety of origins in microgram amounts by costly and time consuming chemical procedures including fractionation, gel permeaton chromatography and reverse phase highs preaure liquid chromatography. The first public report of the use of recombinant DNA techniques for the manufacture, cloning and expression of structural genes for Type I TGF occurred after the filing date of applicants parent U.S. Application Serial No. 547,484 in Derynk, et al., supra. No report of use of such tech niques to create polypeptide analogs thereof has occurred to date.Nor have there been any published reports of attempts to generate composite or fused or hybrid polypeptides possessing, in part, the biochemical and immunological properties of EGF and, in part, the biochemical and immunological properties of Type I TGF. There thus continues to be a need in the art for fully operative methods and materials suitable for use in the large scale production of pure, biologically active Type I TGF, polypeptide analogs thereof, and hybrid polypeptides comprising portions of the amino acid residue sequences of EGF and Type I TGF. BRIEF SUMMARY Provided by the present invention are manufactured genes capable of directing synthesis, in a selected host microorganism, of Type I Transforming Growth Factor.In preferred forms of manufactured genes of the invention, the base sequence codes for a polypeptide duplicative of either human or rat species Type I TGF hTGF and wrTSF and includes one or more codons selected from among alternative codons specifying the same amino acid on the basis of preferential expression characteristics for the codon in a projected host mIcroorganism, e.g., E.coli. Other preferred forms of manufactured genes include those wherein there is provided a base codon specifying an additional amino acid residue in the polypeptide encoded which facilitates the direct expression in E.coli organisms e,g., an initial Met residue . In still other preferred forms of manufactured genes, the sequence of base codons specifying the desired polypeptide is preceded by and or followed by and or includes one or more sequences of bases facilitatlng formation of expression vectors or generation of new structural genes for polypeptide analogs, i.e., sequences of bases providing for termination of transcription, or for promoter regulator regions, and or sequences of bases providing for selected restriction endonuclease cleavage sites on one or both ends of the structural gene or at intermediate positions therein. Preferably sequences at one or both ends of the structural gene code for restriction endonuclease enzyme recognition sites which occur only once in the vector in which the gene is to be inserted.Intermediate sequences in the gene desirably code for restriction endonuclease enzyme recognition sites unique to the gene itself as well as not present in any vector construction.

As a further aspect of the present invention, there are provided genes comprising manufactured Type t TGF genes and gene fragments according to the invention fused to a secant gene or gne fragment which itself iE capable of directing synthesis of a second biologically active polypeptide e.g., urogastrone, epidermal growth factor, EC,F in a manner permitting the microbial expression of a fused or hybrid polypeptide including a part o all of Type I Transforming Growth Factor polypeptide or polypeptide analog and a part or all of a second polypeptide such as EGP. Exemplary hybrid polypeptide products of such manufactured genes include the hybrid polypeptides designated rTGF1 32 hEGF32 53 , hEGF1 31 rTGF33 50 , hTGF132 hEGF3253 , and hEGF1 31 hTGF33 50 . In practice of the invention to generate polypeptide products, manufactured DNA sequences are inserted into viral or circular plasmid DNA vectors to form hybrid vectors and the hybrid vectors are employed to genetically transform host microorganisms such as bacteria e.g., E.coli or yeast cells. The genetically transformed microorganisms are thereafter grown under appropriate nutrient conditions and express the polypeptide products of the invention a Also encompassed by the present invention is the development of antibody substances generated to theType I TGF polypeptides described herein and to polypeptide analogs and fragments thereof.

The following examples illustrate practice of the invention in the manufacture of the DNA sequences coding for microbial expression of Type I hTGF, Type I rTGF, polypeptide analogs thereof, and Type I TGF EGP hybrid polypeptides. Also illustrated is the construstion of expression vectors for direct expression of desired polypeptides. The following example is directed to the general procedure employed in the synthesis of ollgonucleo tide fragments for the manufacture of structural genes according to the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Oligonucleotide fragments were synthesized using a four step procedure and several intermediate washes. Polymer bound dlmethoxytrttyl protected nucleoside in a sintered glass funnel was first stripped of its 5 protecting group dimethoxytrityl using 3 trichloroacetic acid in dichloromethane for 1 1 2 minutes.The polymer was then washed with dichloromethane and acetonitrile. The washed polymer was then rinsed with dry acetonitrile, placed under argon and treated in the condensation step as follows. 0.5 ml of a solution of 10 mg tetrazole in acetonitile was added to the reaction vessel containing polymer. Then O.S ml of 30 mg protected nucleoside phosphoramidite in acetonitrile was added a This reaction was agitated and allowed to react for 2 minutes The reactants were then removed by suction and the polymer rinsed with acetonitrile.This was followed by the oxidation step wherein 1 ml of a solution containing 0.1 molar I2 in 2 6 lutidine H2O THF, 1s2s2, was redacted with the polymer bound oligonucleotide chain for 10 seconds, Following a THF rinse capping of unreacted nucleotides was done using a solution of dimethylaminopyridine 6.5 g in 100 ml THF and acetic anhydride, 2,6 lutidine 1 1 in the proportion 4 1 for 2 minutes.This was followed by a methanol rinse and a THF rinse.Then the cycle began again with a trichloroacetic acid in CH2C12 treatment, The cycle was repeated until the desired oligonucleotide sequence was obtained. The final oligonucleotide chain was treated with thlophenol, triethylamine, dloxane 1 1 2 , for 45 minutes at room temperature. Then, after rinsing with dioxanc, methanol and diethylether, the oligonucleotide was cleaved from the polymer with concentrated ammonia at room temperature. After decanting the solution from the polymer, the concentrated ammonia solution was heated at EO0C for 16 hours in a sealed tube. Each oligonucleotide solution was then extracted four tines with l butanol The solution was loaded into a 208 polyacrylamide 7 molar urea electrophoresis gel and, after running, the appropriate product band was isolated. The following example is directed to the manufacture of structural genes coding for Type I TGF and also illustrates the manner in which structural genes for polypeptide analogs thereof may be prepared. EXAMPLE 2 Fourteen specific deoxyoligonucleotides numbered 1 through 14 were synthesized according to the procedures of Example 1. The oligonucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoreels and were then phosphorylated at the 5 ends using ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase In a standard reaction using one nanomole of DNA, a two fold excess of ATP and 1 unit ofT4 kinase in 20 l of buffer made with 50 mM hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dlthiothreitol, pH 7.6. After reaction, the kinase was destroyed by boiling for 5 minutes. These phosphorylated oligonucleotldes in the buffer were then used directly for ligation. The oligonucleotides in 20 l standard buffer were combined to form short duplexes. Each duplex was formed by combining two complementary sequences in equimolar amounts, boiling the mixture, then slow cooling over a 1 2 hour period to room temperature. In this way, seven duplexes were formed. These seven duplexes were combined sequentially, annealing each set of duplexes at 379C for 5 minutes until the final structural gene was in a single tube ready for legation. The oligonucleotide mixture was then made 150 molar in ATP and treated with 84 units of T4DNA ligase for 16 hours at 40C. The fully ligated structural gene was then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoreals. Table II below illustrates the finally assembled structural gene coding for direct microbial expression of a polypeptide having the primary structure of rat Type t TGF. TABLE IIEMI13.1 Table III below illustrates the finally assembled structural gene coding for direct microbial expression of a polypeptide having the primary structure of human Type I TGF. TABLE IIIEMI13.2 TALE YII continued EMI14.1 Included in each Table is the numbered sequence of amino acid residues specified ben the DNA sequence is suitably inserted within a microbial expression vector.Each polypeptide sequence is thus seen to comprise the series of fifty amino acids of naturally occurring rat and human Type I TGF together with an initial methionine residue at position 1 . In the Tables, codons specifying each amino acid are aligned below the designation of the residue specified. Bracketed regions in the DNA sequence indicate the fourteen separate oligonucleotides initially formed and also designate the intermediate duplexes e.g., 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc. . Wherever consistent with the procedures for construction of the manufactured gene, codon usage is selected on the basis of preferences of the projected expression host e.g., E.coli according to the data set out In Grantham, et al., Nucleic AcidsResearch, 8, pages r49 r62 1980 Grantham, et al.,Nucleic Acids Research, 8, pages 1893 1912 1980 1 andGrantham, et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 9, pages r43r74 1981 .See, also, Bennetzen, et al., J.Biol.Chem., 257, pp. 3026 3031 1982 and Grosjean, et al,, Gene, 18, pp. 199 209 1982 . The codons employed in generating the Type ITGF structural genes of Tables II and ItI are among those enabling maximal expression in E,coli. Numerous changes may be made to facilitate expression and or facilitate manipulations involved in generating structural genes coding for Type I TGF analogs. As an example, by employlng alternative codons, it was possible to introduce two unique, internal restriction sites at the first third and last third of the genes i.e., NcOT and SphI . This permits each gene to be altered or spliced where desired to adapt to further specIes specific changes in the amino acid sequence. The BglII recognition site prior to the termination codons permits additional sequences to be added where desired.Codon changes may also be employed to alter secondary structure present in the manufactured structural gene, At that end of each gene which specifies the amino terminal residues of the polypeptide to be expressed Met 1, Val1, etc. there are provided bases forming the sticky end of a selected restriction endonuclease enzyme recognition site here, illustratively, a BamHI sticky end . At the end of each gene which specifies the carboxy terminal residue of the polypeptide Ala50 there are provided translation stop codons e.g., TAA, TAG and bases forming a sticky end of a similarly selected restriction endonuclease recognition site here, illustra tively, a Sal sticky end .It will be understood that one or more entire, duplex endonuclease recognition sites may be provided at each end which can be enzyme treated to form a selected sticky end Ln the course of insertion into a vector. A leader DNA sequence may be provided at the 5 end of that coding ntrand to provide alternate restriction endonuclease recoznltlon sites, permitting the TypeI TGF sequence to be inserted behind selected promoter operators. As an example, the leader DNA sequence set out below facilitates insertion of a Type I TGF gene adjacent to a synthetic T5 early promoter replica DNA sequence specifically, the TSA lac promoterfoperator sequence, disclosed in co owned, co pending U.S.PatentApplication Serial No. 521,959 by Banks, et al., filedAugust 10, 1983 and entitled Enhancement of MicrobialExpression of Polypeptides , which is incorporated by reference herein , or the XPL promoter see, e.g., Shimatake, et ala, Nature, 292 128 132 1981 1 or the commonly used trp promoter for direct expression 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Met tys Lys Tyr Trp Ile Gln Met 5t 5AA TTC TCT AGA ATG AAG AAA TAT TGG ATC CAG ATG 3 EcoRI XbaI BamHIThe XbaI site permits the polypeptide coding sequence to be inserted 3 to a trp promoter for production of a polypeptide having a short pro polypeptide sequence cleavable at Met 1 with cyanogen bromide. The leaderDNA sequence with its EcoRI recognition site also enables the construction of a fusion peptide with the ss galacto sidase enzyme, which also possesses an EcoRI recognition site intermediate in the gene coding sequence.A leaderDNA sequence as above may bo manufactured at the same time as the structural gene or added by insertion of the structural gene into a plasmid already incorporating the sequence. Novel Type I TGF analog genes coding for microbial expression of polypeptide sequences differing from the natural Type I TGF sequence may also be prepared by altering the base sequences selected oligonucleotides and repeating the ligation step to obtain the new genes. or example, by altering oligonucleotide numbers 2 and 9 in rat Type I sF, the codon specifying lysine at residue 7 way be changed to one specifying aspartic acid, which is the residue at position 7 of human TypeI TGF. The codon modification in oligonucleotide number 2 would be from 5 AAA 3 to 5 GAT 3 or 5 GAC 3 . The modification in rat Type I TGF oligonucleotide number 9 would be from 3 TTT S to 3 CTA 5 or 3 CTG 5 . Similarly by altering rat Type I TGF oligonucleotide numbers 3 and 10, and changing the tyrosine at residue 15 to phenylalanine, the sequence becomes more similar to the human sequence. The codon modifications in oligonucleotide number 3 are from 5 TAC 3 to 5 TTC 3 . In oligonucleotide number 10, the complementary codon changes are from 3 ATG 5 to 3 AAG 5 , Several codon modifications can be employed to alter the sequence of any desired amino acid to any other amino acid accordingly. The following examples relate to procedures for construction of expression vectors for use in transformation of microbial host cells to secure expression of certain Type I TGF polypeptide products of the invention. EXAMPLE 3 A. Construction of Plasmid pADHl5 The 166 base pair manufactured Type I rTGF gene illustrated in Table II of Example 2 and havingBamHI and salt sticky ends was inserted into a similarly digested E.coIl pBR322 derived cloning vector pTP which contains the leader DNA sequence of Example 2 having EcoRI and XbaI restriction endonuclease enzyme recognltion sites located 4 to Its samHI restriction endonuclease enzyme recognition site. Resulting plasmid pADHlZ contained the Type I TGF gene sequence 3 to the followingDNA leader sequence already present in the original vector 5 GAA TTC TCT AGA ATG AAG AAA TAT TGG ATC C 3 . EcoRI xbaI BamHIClones with the gene were characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to verify the estimated molecular weight for the Type I TGF structural gene. pADH12 was cleaved with restriction endonuclease enzymes XbaI and Salt, and the small fragment containing bases coding for the leader sequence hollowed by the 166 base pair Type I TGF coding sequence was inserted into a similarly digested p5R322 derived expression plasmid pInt txB4 which contains a tryptophan synthetase trp promoter sequence and an XbaI site 3 to a Shine Dalgarno sequence followed by a structural gene coding for another polypeptide. See, co owned, co pending U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 483,451, by Alton, et al., filedApril 15, 1983 1PC International Publication No. W083 04053, published November 24, 19831 and entitled The Manufacture and Expression of Large StructuralGenes , which is incorporated by reference herein. The resulting plasmid, pADlilS, therefore has the Type I rTGF gene placed under the control of the trp promoter. TheInsertion of the leader sequence and Type I rTGF gene in the correct orientation has been verified by restriction enzyme analysis and molecular weight sizing using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Vector pADH15 is employed as an expression vector In an E.coli host to generate a polypeptide product which includes a pro sequence of 8 amino acids as follows NH2 Met 8 Lys 7 Lys 6 Tyr 5 Trp 4 Ile 3 Gln 2 Met 1 TGF COOH. B. Construction of Plasmid pADH96 Upon association of the manufactured Type I rTGF structural gene with a suitable promoter operator toe within plasmid pADH15, further manipulations were performed in an attempt to generate an expression vector which would provide for high levels of E.coli expression of the desired protein. These manipulations involved use of a plasmid which is the subject of co owned, co pending, U.s. Patent Application Serial No. 521,964, byMorris, filed August 10, 1983 and entitled DNA Plasmids . The disclosures of said application are specifically incorporated by reference herein. Briefly noted, plasmid pCFM414 A.T C.C. 40076 , employed in the construction, includes a temperature sensitive mutation in the copy control region. Upon transformation with this vector, host cell cultures grown at 300C will have a low number of copies of the plasmid. The plasmid copy number increases fifty fold i.e., runs away within the host cells upon elevation of the culture temperature above 340C. Growth at 370C will ordinarily be lethal to the cells. The specific manipulations involved in construction of a vector using A.T.C.C. 40076 were as follows.Plasmid pADH15 was digested with EcoRI 5 to the trp promoter and Sell to generato an approximately 4ssO base pair fragment including the Type I rTGF structural gene, codons for the leader sequence and the associated tor promoter operator. Plasmid pCFM414 was digested withEcoRI and XhoI and the large fragment was isolated.The EcoRI SalI fragment containing the Type I TGF gene from pADH15 was then ligated with the large EcoRI XhoI fragment of pCFM414 to generate plasmid pADH96. While this con struction retained an intaot EcoRI recognition site and, while ligation of the complementary sticky ends of ot and XhoI did not restore either recognition bite, a BamHI site adjacent to the XhoI site of pCFM414 was retained.It is also noteworthy that this construction resulted in the placement of the Type I rTSt structural gene 5 to transcription terminator sequence, Toop, present 3 to the XhoI site in pCFM414. The above procedures provide for construction of pADH96 by incorporation of gene of Table II into first and second intermediate plasmids pADHl2 and pADH15 wherein the gene was first associated with a leader sequence and then with the trp promoter , prior to its insertion into pCFM414 cut with EcoRI and XhoI. A duplicate plasmid could be constructed by adding a linker sequence including a BamHI sticky end to the Table II gene at the terminal Sali sticky end and inserting in the correct orientation the resulting BanHI double sticky ended sequence into the large fragment resulting from BamRI digestion of plasmid pADH59 disclosed in the above noted applicants co pending U.S.Patent Application Serial No. 486,091, filed April 25, 1983 PCTInternational Publication No. WQ83 04030, publishedNovember 24, 19831, entitled The Manufacture and Expression of Genes for Urogastrone and Polypeptide AnalogsThereof , the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. Plasmid pADH59, which is harbored in E.coliJM103 cells deposited as ATCC 39335, includes a manufactured gene coding for urogastrone, a leader sequence as described above and the trp promoter regulator derived from plnt y txB4, all inserted into pCFM414. The urogastrone gene is excisable by means of BamHI digestion, leaving as the large fragment a precise duplicate of pADH96 if it were subjected to the same enzymatic digestion. If, therefore, the Table II manufactured sequence is provided with a linker including the fol 5 TCGAG 3 lowing sequence, 3 CCTAG 5 , it can be inserted into the BamHI digestion product of pADH59 to yield a duplicate of pADH96. EXAMPLE 4 A. Construction of Plasmid pADH123 The 166 base pair manufactured Type I hTGF gene illustrated in Table III of Example 2, having BamHI andSal sticky ends, was amplified by insertion into a similarly cleaved Ml3mp9 vector, resulting in plasmid pADH120. The Type I hTGF gene was thereafter cleaved with BamHI SalI from pADH120 and inserted into BamHI SalIdigested pADH25. pADH25 was also previously described in the above noted U.S. Patent Application Serial No.486,091. Briefly put, pADH25 contained a portion of a pBR322 derived plasmid pINT Txb4 with a manufacturedXbaI site following the trp promoter regulator sequence, a DNA linker sequence constructed with an internal Xba recognition site as set out below EcoRI XbaI BamHI GAA TTC TCT AGA ATG AAG AAA TAT TG AGA TCT TAC TTC TTT ATA ACC TAG and a manufactured urogastrone sequence. pADH25 was digested with BamHI SalI to remove the sequence coding for urogastrone and the BamHI Salr Type I hTGF sequence was inserted therein, thus producing expression vector pADH123. Vector pADH123 was employed as an expression vector in an E.coli host to generate a polypeptide product which includes the 8 amino acid pro sequence identified in Example 3A above. B. construction of Plasmid pADH131 procedures similar to those described for the enhanced expression of Type t rTGF in Example 3B above were followed for the Type I hTGF manufactured sequence. Plasmid pADHl23 was digested with EcoRI 5 to the trp promoter and SalI to generate an approximately 480 base pair fragment including the Type t hTGF structural gene, codons cor the leader sequence and the associated trp promoter operator. Plasmid pCFM414 was digested withEcoRI and XhoI and the large fragment was isolated. TheBcoRI SalI fragment containing the Type I hTGF gene from pADH123 was then ligated with the large ScoRI XhoI frag spent of pCFM414 to generate plasmid pADHl3l, thereby placing the Type I hTGF structural gene 5 to transcrip tion terminator sequence, oop, present 5 to the xhoI site in pCFM414.This construction retained an intactEcoRI recognition site but ligation of the complementary sticky ends of SalI and XhoI did not restore either recognition site. A BamHI site adjacent to the XhoI site of pCFM414 was retained. The following example relates to microbial expression of desired Type I TGF polypeptides of the invention. EXAMPLE 5 Expression of Type I TGF Plasmid pADH96 Example 3B was transformed into E.coli strain JM103 and grown in L broth. Clones with the correct Type I rTGF fragment were isolated and characterized by polyacrylamide electrophoresls. A product of the correct estimated size for Type I rTGF polypeptide was visualized by staining of the gel. Plasmid pADHI3l Example 4B was transformed into H.coli strain JM103 and grown in L broth. Clones with the correct Type I hTGF fragment were isolated and characterized by polyacrylamide electrophoresis. A product of the correct estimated size for Type I hTGF polypeptide was visualized by seainng of the gel. The following example relates to the determination of biological activity of the Type I TGF polypeptides of the present invention. EXAMPLE 6 Prior to performance of the following three assays, the Type I rTGF and Type t hTGF polypeptides including the 8 amino acid leader expressed by pADH96 and pADH131 in E.coli Example 4 was recovered from the host cells through the solubilizatlon and serial reducing and oxidizing treatments described in co owned, co pending U.s. Patent Application Serial No, 521,90B, by Banks, fIled August 10, 1983 and entitled Enhancement of Blological Activity of Microbially Expressed Polypeptidea and the disclosures of said application are specifically incorporated by reference herein. A. EGF radioreceptor Assay An EGF radloreceptor assay was performed according to the procedures described in Marquardt, et al.,PNAS USA , 80, supra at page 4685, employing either theType I rTGF or Type I hTGF polypeptide of the present invention and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells.The Type I rTGF and Type t hTGF of the present invention were each found to be biologically active in this assay, competing with 1251 EGF for binding to the EGF receptors on the A431 cells. B. Tritiated Thymidine Uptake Assay A 3H thymidine uptake assay essentially according to procedures described in Eollenberg, M., et al.,J.Biol.Chem., 250, 3846 3853 1975 was performed em ploying the Type I rTGF polypeptide of the present inven tion and human foreskin fibroblasts. The Type I rTGF of the present invention was determined to be mitogenic in this assay, and therefore biologically active. C. Softar Colonrming Assay The Type I rTGF and Type I hTGF polypeptides of the present invention were also assayed for biological activity through a Soft Agar Colony Forming Assay according to procedures described in Marquardt, H., et al.,J.Biol.Chem., 257, supra at page 5221, using normal rat kidney fibroblasts. Biological activity of the Type I rTGF and Type I hTGF polypeptides was confirmed by the formation of colonies on the soft agar in this assay. D. Antibody Development Research efforts are presently directed to the generation of antibody substances to the polypeptides discussed and disclosed herein. More specifically, procedures for the development of monoclonal antibodies to Type I hTGF and Type I rTGF are currently ongoing. It has been preliminarily determined, however, that mice immunized with the recombinant Type I hTGF which had been reduced with dithiothreitol which disrupts the three disulfide bonds of the molecule produced polyvalent antibody in serum. In preliminary tests this antibody has proven capable of recognizing Type I rUGF obtained from bona fide biological sources when reduced with ditbiothreitol. In addition, it recognizes recombinant dithiothreitol reduced Type I rTGF, and its immunogen recombinant dithlothreitol reduced Type z hTGF. The antibody, however, has not presently shown any recognition of Type I rTGF in its natural biological conformation. It is further expected that both polyvalent and monoclonal antibody substances may be developed against polypeptide analogs of rTGF and hTGF and polypeptide fragments thereof by practice of conventional techniques known to those skilled in immunological research. See, e.g., techniques for development of hybridoma cell lines described in Paul ed. , Fundamental Immunology, Ch, 28, pp. 751 765, Raven Press, New York 1981 and reference cited therein. Of particular interest is the development of monoclonal antibodies to the Type ITGF polypeptides, analogs and fragments for potential use as reagents in diagnostic assays for the quantitation and detection of Type I TGF from biological sources. The following example relates to procedures for construction of expression vectors for use In transformation of microbial host cells to secure expression of hybrid polypeptide products of the invention comprising hybrid polypeptides incorporating a portion of the amino acid sequence of rat Type I TGF and a portion of the amino acid sequence of human urogastrone hEGF . EXAM A. Construction of Plasmids pADH55 and pADH100 A hybrid gene coding for the first 32 amino acids at the amino terminus of Type I rTGF and the last 22 amino acids at the carboxy terminus of human EGF was constructed according to the following procedures.Plasmid pADH25, a pBR322 derived plasmid containing the trp promoter and a DNA sequence coding for an 8 amino acid pro sequence, followed by a gene coding for urogastrone EGP , as disclosed in the aforementionedU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 486,091, was digested with BamHI and SphI. The coding region for the first 32 amino acids of human EGF was thereby excised from plasmid pADH25, which was then treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. Plasmid pADH12 Example 3A con taming the Type I TGF structural gene was similarly digested with BamEI and s and the 101 base pair BamHI SphI fragment was isolated by polyacrylamlde gel electrophoresis.The isolated Type I TGF fragment from pADHlZ was then mixed with the BamHI SphI digested fragment from plasmid pADR25 containing the trp promoter and incubated with DNA ligase to provide, upon transformation into E.coll JM103, plasmid pADH55 coding for the Type I TGF EGF hybrid protein, pADH55 isolated from JM103 culture was then digested with EcoRI and Sall to excise the complete trp promoter and the gene coding region providing for the first 32 amino acids of Type I TGF and last 22 amino acids of EGF. This fragment was then ligated into EcoRI XhoI digested pCFM414 as described for the generation of pADH96 in Example 3B above to place the promotergene fragment in the resulting temperature sensitive high expression plasmid pADH100. Because the Type I hTGF sequence similarly has the same SpHI restriction site designed into Type I rTGF, the hybrid Type I hTGF1 32 hEGF32 53 can similarly be formed and expressed by one skilled in the techniques described above. B. Construction of Plasmids pADC530 and pADC533 A hybrid gene coding for the first 31 amino acids at the amino terminus of human EGF and the last 18 amino acids at the carboxy terminus of Type I rTGF was constructed as described in the following manipulations.Plasmid pADH25 Example 7A was digested with SpRI and Sall to excise the coding region for the last 22 amino acids of EGF and thereafter the pADF25 fragment containing the trp promoter was treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase.Plasmid pADH12 containing the Type I TGF structural gene was similarly digeated with SpHI and Sail and the eHi SaI fragment isolated by polyacrylamide gel electtophoresls, The isolated fragment from pADH12 was then Incubated with the promoter containing fragment from digested plasmid pADH25 and DNA ligase to provide plasmid pADC530, which codes for the EGF Type I T F hybrid protein upon transformation into E.coli JM103. pADC530 isolated from JM103 culture was then digested with EcoRl and Sall to excise the complete trp promoter and gene coding region for the first 31 amino acids of EGF and last 18 amino acids of Type I TGF. This fragment uas then ligated into EcoRI XhoI digested pCFM414 as described above, resulting in the promotergene fragment in the temperature sensitive high expression plasmid pADCS33. As described above, the analogous hybrid hEGF1 31 Type I hTGF33 50 may also be designed and expressed employing the procedures recited above. The following example relates to microbial expression of desired Type I TGF EGF hybrid polypeptides of the invention. EXAMPLE 8 Expression of Type I TGF EGF Hybrids Plasmid pADH100, transformed into E.coli strainJM103 and grown in L broth expressed. the hybrid polypeptide designated Type I rTGF1 32 hEGF32 53 , containing the first 32 amino acids of Type I TGF and the last 22 amino acids of EGF, at approximately So mg OD liter The hybrid polypeptide designated hEGF1 31 Type I rTGF33 50 containing the first 31 amino acids of EGF and the last 18 amino acids of Type I TGF in the temperature sensitive high expression plasmid pADC5Rr, transformed into E.coli JM103 and grown in L broth, was quantified at approximately 80 mg OD liter. he foregoing Illustrative examples are pr n cipally directed to construction of manufactured structural genes for Type I TGF and analog polypeptides and for Type I TGF hybrid polypeptides which are suited for use in direct expression and fusion product repression in E.coli host cells. Manufactured genes could readily be constructed in a manner especially well suited for direct expression in yeast cells through use of yeast preference codons.Further, the procedures of co owned, co pending U.S. Patent Application SerIal No. 487,753, filed April 22, 1983, by Bitter and entitled Secretion of Exogenous Polypeptides from Yeast could be employed to secure yeast expression coupled with secretion of polypeptide products into the growth medium. In such a case it would be unnecessary to provide a metbionine specifying, translation initiating ATG codon 5 to theType I TGF specifying codons. While the foregoing illustrative examples specifically relate to synthesis of hybrid polypeptides involving rat Type I TGF and human EGF fragments, it will be understood that hybrids involving the human or other species Type I TGF sequence are within the contemplation of the invention. Further, while certain of the examples relate to hybrids comprising approximately one third of the sequence of residues of Type I TGF or EGF and two thirds of the sequence of residues of the alternative growth factor, it should be understood that other forms of hybrid polypeptides can be synthesized which may possess valuable composite biological activities. Analysis by the methods of flopp and Woods, PNAS USA , 78, 3824 1981 reveals, for example, that naturally occurring Type I TSF includes three principal hydrophilic regions.These are located, respectively, at or near residues 8, 28, and 44. Additionally, preliminary studies carried out on synthetic fragments of EGF have tentatively identified the central region of the polypeptide as being highly significant to binding to EGF receptors on cells.It is thus projected that hybrid polypeptides comprising amino and carboxy terminal portions duplicating those of Type I TGF and central portions duplicating EGF may display desirable Type I TGF like properties and yet have desirable characteristics which are equivalent to those of naturally occurring EGF. products of the present Invention and or antibodies thereto may be suitably tagged , for example radiolabelled e.g., with I125 conjugated with enzymes or fluorescently labelled, to provide reagent materials useful in assays and or diagnostic test kits, for the qualitative and or quantitative determination of the presence of such products and or said antibodies in fluid samples. Such antibodies may be obtained from the inoculation of one or more animal species e.g., mice, rabbit, goat, human, etc. or from monoclonal antibody sources. Any of such reagent materials may be used alone or in combination with a suitable substrate, e.g., coated on a glass or plastic particle or bead. Numerous modifications and variations in the practice of the invention are expected to occur to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the foregoing illustrative examples. Consequently, the invention should be considered as limited only to the extent reflected by the appended claims. ATCC 40076 was deposited with American Type Culture Collection on 21st July. 1984.
