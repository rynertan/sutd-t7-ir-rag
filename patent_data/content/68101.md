# Electrochemical analytical apparatus.

## Abstract
Analytical apparatus comprises an electrolytic cell 10 comprising a counter electrode 12 and a reference elec trode 14 . Working electrodes 16, 18 are positioned equi distantly and symmetrically from the counter and reference electrodes. Currents through the electrolyte between the working electrodes and the cell wall are induced by energis ing the counter electrode through a differential amplifier 22 . Further differential amplifiers 32, 34 coupled to the respective working electrodes provide analysis output sig nals at output terminal 30.
