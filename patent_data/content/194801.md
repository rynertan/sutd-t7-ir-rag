# Improvements in skid sensing means for vehicle hydraulic anti skid braking systems.

## Abstract
A flywheel mechanism 5 acts on a dump valve 8 through a lever assembly 75 . The lever assembly 75 comprises a lever 76 which carries an arm 78 at an intermediate point in its length and the arm 78 projects through a seal 79 into a chamber 56 in a casing 4 to co operate with the valve member 81 of the dump valve which is engageable with a seating 82 . The arm 78 is pivotally connected to the casing 5 by a pivot pin 80 of which the axis is offset from the main axis of the arm 78 in a direction towards the flywheel mechanism 5 . Brake press ure acts on the arm 78 to move it angularly about the pin 80 in a direction to enhance the closing force of the dump valve. Offsetting the pin 80 ensures that the flywheel mechanism 5 has to generate a relatively higher torque on good surfaces when relatively high brake pressures are present before the dump valve 8 will open, than on poor surfaces when the brake pressures are relatively low.
