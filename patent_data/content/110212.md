# AIR BEARING MAGNETIC HEAD SLIDER ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A semi self loading air bearing ferrite slider assen has a tapered leading surface portion 18 extending from a cross rail 15 from which side rails 13, 14 and a middle rail 16 extend rearwardly. The middle rail 16 progres sively narrows to form the transducer portion 37 where it extends across the gap 35 between the body portion 10 and core piece 29 near the trailing end of the rail. Etched surfaces 21, 22 between the middle rail 16 and the side rails 13, 14 provide subambient pressure during operation when the slider is in flight whereby the balance between the repelling air bearing surface 11 and attraction of the sub ambient pressure areas 21, 22 supplements the stabilizing force of the load arm.
