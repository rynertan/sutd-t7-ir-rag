# DATA PROCESSING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A data processing arrangement is designed to transform the co ordinates of a two dimensional data array into a modified array by applying a 2 x 2 matrix to the original co ordinate pattern. In this way transformation such as rotation, shear, magnification and reflection can be achieved. The arrangement is capable of handling large two dimensional arrays, each co ordinate pair of which must be individually transformed. This is achieved by presenting the original co ordinates X, Y to two dedicated multiplier devices as two data streams representing the two components X and Y of the co ordinate pairs respectively. Each multiplier multiplies the co ordinate presented to it by one of two selectable parameters and the outputs of the multipliers are summed together at an adder to produce new co ordinates X aX bY and Y cX dY where the parameters a and c are available to one multiplier and the parameters b and d are available to the other multiplier. The new co odinates X and Y appear at the output of the adder as a single interleaved data stream, and can be separated out as required. The arrangement is able to operate at very high speeds as fast dedicated multipliers are used, but at the same time it is very versatile as the nature of the transformation produced depends solely on the four parameters, which can be simply changed as necessary to produce a different transformation. A modification of the arrangement extends the inven tion to a 3 x 3 matrix.
