# AN ELECTRONIC INTERFACE DEVICE BETWEEN A COMPUTER AND EXTERNAL UNIT

## Abstract
An electronic device is disclosed for interfacing be tween a computer and an external unit such as another computer adapted for interfacing by asynchronous trans mission on the V24 RS232 Standard with the local telex or teletype. The interface is specially designed for the so called personal computers and is of a highly reduced size and moderate cost. The interface, which is managed by the computer cen tral processor whereto it is connected and has, therefore, no intelligent components, comprises a parallel series, or vice versa, data conversion circuit, a multiplexer demulti plexer adapted to route the data from the computer toward and external computer or telex line, first line conversion circuits from the computer standard to the telex line stan dard, and second level conversion circuits from the com puter standard to the V24 Standard, as well as a supply unit adapted to generate the 60V voltage, all these being accommodated as a set on a single board directly con nectable to the computer central unit.
