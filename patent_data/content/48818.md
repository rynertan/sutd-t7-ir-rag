# Decholesterisation of egg yolk.

## Abstract
A process of reducing the amount of cholesterol in egg yolk which comprises reducing the pH of fresh wet egg yolk to destabilise the emulsion, treating the destabilised emulsion with an edible oil to form a fine dispersion and centrifuging the dispersion to separate the egg yolk phase from the oil phase.
