# A process for preparing semi flexible polyurethane foams, and the prepared foams.

## Abstract
Semi flexible, shock absorbing polyurethane foams containing an amylaceous material, such as a cereal starch or flour, and having an open cell structure are prepared by co reacting the amylaceous material and a polyether with an aromatic polyisocyanate having a functionality of about 2 to about 2.4. The foams are particularly useful in crash padding.
