# Silver halide photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
Silver halide photographic light sensitive material com prising a support having thereon one or more silver halides, exhibits excellent graininess and image sharpness when at least one of said silver halide emulsion layers comprises sub stantially monodisperse core shell type silver halide grains having not less than 8 mol of silver iodide in the core thereof and a DIR compound having a relative development inhibitabil ity ρs of not less than 1, as defined below ρs ρ ρB ρ 1 γi γO wherein, ρ represents the development inhibitability of the DIR compound γi represents the gamma value of a color develop ed silver halide color photographic light sensitive material con taining the DIR compound. γO represents the gamma value of a color developed silver halide color photographic light sensi tive material not containing the DIR compound and ρ
