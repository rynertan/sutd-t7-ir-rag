## Description
CONTROLLED SUDSING DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS Granular detergent compositions, particularly those intended for domestic clothes washing, are employed in a wide range of washing conditions. Some garments are washed by hand, at temperatures ranging from nearly cold up to about 45 5O0C, some are washed in upright washing machines, some in the more modern drum machines at temperatures ranging from cold to 400C, 600C and near boiling according to the machine wash cycle selected. As the user naturally prefers to be able to use a single washing product for all purposes, it is necessary to design products which have good performance in all washing conditions. The sudsing properties of detergent compositions are very important features of their performance.Thus users expect a considerable degree of sudsing when they use the products for hand washing, i.e. at low temperatures with relatively mild agitation. On the other hand, in drum washing machines very little suds formation can be tolerated at any temperature, since excessive suds interfere with the action of the wash liquor on the clothes, and may even overflow from the machine. This requirement is opposed to the natural tendency of detergent compositions to form suds more copiously in the conditions of the hotter wash cycles of a drum washing machine than in the cool hand washing conditions. Many formulations have been made which achieve suds suppression in drum washing machines with reasonable success, and some attempts have been made to obtain also adequate sudsing at low temperatures, but these methods and compositions therefor are generally effective only in detergent compositions based upon certain organic detergents. It has recently been found that built laundry detergents based upon specific mixtures of selected anionic, nonionic and cationic surfactants have improved cleaning properties for removing greasy and oily stains, without detriment to their effectiveness for removing particulate soiling or for soil suspension or whiteness maintenanse. To achieve the desired pattern of sudsing with detergent compositions based upon these organic detergent mixtures has proved very difficult. Previously known suds depressants such as high molecular weight soaps or fatty acids, waxes, silicones and various known mixtures thereof, have failed in various ways, for instance in giving insufficient suppression of sudsing in the boil wash cycles of drum washing machines, or in giving too much suds suppression under hand washing conditions. It has now been found that certain combinations of wax, hydrophilic nonionic dispersant and hydrophobic silica provide the desired suds pattern with the above mentioned types of organic detergents, and with some other organic detergents or mixtures thereof.PRIOR ART There are very many patents and patent applications relating to suds controlling agents, and the following may be mentioned as typical British Patents 1,021,098, 1,099,502, 1,207,777, 1,340,043, 1,407,997, 1,492,938, 1,492,939, British Patent Applications 75 11002, 76 26323.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, there is provided a granular built detergent composition having a controlled sudsing pattern characterised in that it comprises the following components, in per cent by weight A from 38 to 30t preferably 5 to 15 of organic detergent which Xetersent contains at least 509 by weight thereof of nonionic and or water soluble cationic surfactant B from 10 to 96.9 preferably 20 to 60 of detergency builder and C as suds controlling system, from 0.1 to 5 of a dispersion containing by weight thereof a from 5 to 50 , preferably from 5 to 15 , of a hydrophilic nonionic dispersing agent having an HLB in the range from 14 to 19, and b from 5 to 55 , preferably from 5 to 15 , of hydrophobic silica, uniformly dispersed in c from 40 to 90 , preferably from 60 to 85 of wax wherein the suds controlling system is in admixture with preformed granules comprising some or all of the organic detergent and or detergency builder components of the composition.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONTHE ORGANIC DETERGENT The organic detergent component of the compositions of the invention consists of at least 50 by weight of nonionic and or water soluble cationic surfactants and may additionally contain anionic, zwitterionic and amphoteric surfactants.Detergent compositions based upon preddminantly anionic organic detergents when containing the ternary suds controlling systems of the invention tend to over suds in drum washing machines at low or moderate temperature. Preferred organic detergent mixtures comprises 358 to 99 of nonionic surfactants, of the types described more fully hereinafter.A more preferred organic detergent mixture comprises a water soluble or water dispersible combination of ethoxylated nonionic, water soluble quaternary ammonium cationic, and anionic surfactants wherein the weight ratio of anionic to cationic surfactant is no more n n 5 and the w ight t o of nonionic to cationic surfactant is at least 2 3, and wherein the surfactant system contains anionic and cationic surfactants in an equivalent ratio cf at least 1 1. Mixtures of this sort are described in copending EuropeanPatent Application 78 200 050.9. In the preferred system, the anionic and cationic surfactants have a combined total of no more than 34 carbon atoms counted in hydrophobic groups having at least 4 consecutive carbon atoms e.g.alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl groups etc. . In more preferred systems, the number of such hydrophobic group carbon atoms totals from about 18 to 33, especially from about 26 to 32, with the anionic surfactant providing at least 12 of the carbon atoms. These hydrophobicity limi tations have bee found to optimize the interaction of the ternary active system with greasy and oily stains on fabrics and to correspond to compositions of maximum grease detergency effectiveness. In these detergent systems, the cationic surfactant is a water soluble quaternary ammonium compound having a critical micelle concentration for the pure material of at least 200 p.p.m. and preferably at least 500 p.p.m. specified at 30 C and in distilled water.

Particularly preferred compositions of this class include C12 alkyl trimethylammonium halide and C14 alkyl trimethylammonium halide. Where m is equal to 2, the R1 chains should have less than 14 carbon atoms. Thus, ditallowdimethylammonium chloride and distearyldimethylammonium chloride, which are used conventionally as fabric softeners and static control agents in detergent compositions, may not be used as the cationic component in the surfactant mixtures of the present invention. Particularly preferred cationic materials of this class include di C8 alkyldimethylammonium halide and di C10 alkyldimethylammonium halide materials. Where m is equal to 3, the R chains should be less than 9 carbon atoms in length. An example is trioctyl methyl ammonium chloride. The reason for this chain length restriction, as is also the case with the di long chain cationics described above, is the relative insolubility of these tri and di long chain materials.

Preferably it contains from 60 to 85 of wax, from 5 to 15 of dispersant and from 5 to 15 of silica. Silicones should preferably be absent as they tend to cause suds suppression in hand wash conditions. Wax Preferred waxes are petroleum waxes of the micro crys,talline, type, melting. generally in the temperature range from 350C to 110 C. Paraffin waxes may also be used, but preferred hydrocarbon wax mixtures comprise not more than 70 paraffin wax. Suitable micro crystalline waxes include Shell micro crystalline wax HMP, and W4, and micro crystalline waxes sold by Witco, and many other suppliers. Paraffin waxes are widely commerically available. Other suitable waxes include Fischer Tropsch and oxidised Fischer Tropsch waxes, ozokerite, ceresin, montan wax, beeswax, candelilla, and carnauba wax, and spermacetti, and other ester waxes having a saponification value less than 100.Other waxy materials which may be employed, preferably constituting less than 50 of the wax component, are partial esters of polyhydric alcohols such as C12 to C20 acid esters of glycerol and sorbitan. Glycerol monostearate is a preferred member of this class. Mixtures of these waxes and waxy materials may be employed. As indicated above, an important consideration in selecting the wax for any given realization of the invention, is its melting point in so far as this controls the softeing point of the suds suppressing system as a whole.The Dispersing Agent The dispersing agent is a hydrophilic nonionic surfactant having a hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB in the range from 14 to 19. These substances are too hydrophile to function effectively as organic detergent components. Many nonionic surfactants having HLB in the above range are known, and a list is given in McCutcheons Detergents and Emulsifiers, North American Edition, 1977 pages 22 26. Preferred nonionic surfactants for this purpose are relatively highly ethoxylated alcohols and alkyl phenols. Preferred are ethoxylated C12 to C20, preferably C16 to C18, alconols with 15 to 100 preferably 20 to 80 ethoxy groups per molecule. The alcohol portion may be branched or unbranched, primary or secondary.Tallow alcohol ethoxylates are most preferred.Silica Another essential component in the suds controlling system is a hydrophobic silica. Suitable silicas are microfine, hydrophobic, particulate silicas. These silicas usually have an average primary particle diameter from about 5 millimicrons m to about 100 mJ, preferably from 10 m to 30 myX The primary particles can form aggregates frequently termed secondary particles having frequently an average particle diameter in the range from about 0.3 to about 3r. Suitable silica components can additionally be characterized by a specific surface area from about 50m2 g to about 400m2 g, preferably from 1OOm2 g to 200m2 g, The specific surface arec can be determined with the aio of the N2 adsorption method. The preferred silica component herein can additionally e defined in having a pH in the range from d to 2, to thus be better compatible with the usually alkaline laundry solution. Generally preferred herein are precipitated hydrophobic microfine silicas with preferred species commercially available under the Trade Names QUSOWR82 and QUSO WR50 from Philadelphia Quartz Company.Additional examples of suitable silicas herein can include pyrogenic silica and aerogel and xerogel silicas provided their general physical properties are as set forth above.The silica can be rendered hydrophobic through one of the well known treatments such as e.g. disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,207,698. Whilst the mechanism of operation of the suds suppression system is not fully understood, it appears that the system has little or no suds suppressing effect at temperatures below its softening point. At about the softening point, which is that of the wax dispersant mixture, the mixture disperses in the wash liquor, the dispersion being aided by the dispersing agent, and the mixture then acts as a suds suppressant. If the softening point is suitably chosen, as by selection of wax and the dispersant and the proportions of each, little or no depression of hand wash suds is caused. In a drum washing machine, suds tend to increase continuously as the temperature of the wash liquor increases. This increase in suds can be reversed at a chosen temperature by choosing, once again, the temperature at which the suds controlling system softens.For most practical purposes, the softening point is in the range from about 400C to about 700C, preferably about sooc. The softening point can be determined by warming a sample of wax or the mixture in the hot stage of a microscope and observing the temperature at which the crystal structure of the wax begins to break down to a substantial degree. Addition Components Trte compositions of the present invention can be supplemented by all manner of detergent components, either by including such components in the aqueous slurry to be ed cr by admixing such components with the compositions the invention following the drying step. Soil suspending agents at about 0.1 to 10 by weight such as water soluble salts of carboxymethyl cellulose, carboxyhydroxymethyl cellulose, and polyethylene glycols having a molecular wit of about 400 to 10,000 are common components of the present invention. Dyes, pigment optical brighteners, and perfumes car. be added in varying amounts as desired. Other materials such as fluorescers, enzymes in minor amounts, anti caking agents such as sodium sulfo succinate, hand sodium benzoate can also be added. Enzymes suitable for use herein include those discussed in U.S. Patents 3,519,570 and 3,533,i39 to McCarty and McCarty et al issued July 7, 1970 and January 5, 1971, respectively. Anionic fluorescent brightening agents are well known materials, examples of which are disodium 4,4 bis 2 diethanolamino 4 anílino s triazin 6 ylamino stilbene 2 2 isulphonate, disodium 4,4 bis 2 morpholino 4 anilino striazin 6 ylaminostilbene 2 2 disulphonate,disodium 4, 4 is 2,4 dianilino s triazin 6 ylamino stilbene 2 2 di lphonate, disodium 4,4 bis 2 anilino 4 N methyl N 2 osraroxyethylamino s triazin 6 ylamino stilbene 2,2 isulphonate, disodium 4,4 bis 4 phenyl 2,1,3 triazol 2 l stilbene 2,2 disulphonate, disodium 4,4 bis 2 anilino 1 methyl 2 hydroxyethylamino s triazin 6 ylamino stilbene ,2 disulphonate and sodium 2 stilbyl 4 naphtho l , , 1,2,3 triazole 2 sulphonate. An alkali metal, or alkaline earth metal, silicate can so be present. The alkali metal silicate preferably is d in an amount groom 0.5 to 10 preferably from 3 to 8 . table silicate solids have a molar ratio of SiO2 alkali tal2O in the range from about 0.5 to about 4.0, but much preferably from 1.0 to 1.8, especially about 1.6. The alkali metal silicates suitable herein can be commercial preparations of the combination of silicon dioxide and alkali metal oxide, fused together in varying proportions.Preparing The Composition The granular detergent compositions of the invention may be prepared in any effective way, for instance by granulating techniques. Generally, a spray dried base powder is prepared containing some or all of the non heat sensitive components, and the other components are added to it, by dry blending or spray on or like means as appropriate.Thus the anionic and nonionic surfactants and the builder and filler components can be spray dried in conventional manner to form a base powder composition and the cationic component can then be added to the base powder either as an approximately 1 1 mixture with part of the builder or filler components retained for that purpose, or as an inclusion complex of, for instance, urea. Alternatively, the cationic surfactant can be sprayed onto the base powder, or added as a dry mixed prill agglomerated with an inorganic or organic agglomerating aid, or can be separately spray dried and added to the base powder as a dry mixed granule. Alternatively, the cationic surfactant and base powder compositions can be individually spray dried in separate stages of a multi stage spray drying tower. Generally, in view of the known problems associated with spray drying mixures containing polyethoxy nonionic detergents, the spray dried base powder contains the anionic and cationic detergents, builders etc., and the nonionic surfactant is sprayed onto the base powder. A critical feature of the present invention is that the suds controlling system must be present as a uniform dispersion and be in admixture with preformed granules comprising some or all of the organic detergent and or detergency builder components of the composition. That is to say, the suds controlling system is prepared in the form of a premix by intimately mixing the dispersing agent, silica and wax, and the suds suppressor premix is then added to a granular base composition comprising organic detergent and or detergency builder.Preferably, the suds controlling system is prepared by melting together the wax and the dispersing agent and raising the temperature to at least that at which they form a single phase, dispersing the silica in the mixture by suitable mixing means, and cooling the mixture rapidly so that the separation does not take place before the mixture freeze6. Optionally, a small amount of an emulsifier may be added to or included in the wax to inhibit phase separation of the wax and the hydrophilic dispersant during cooling of the molten mixture. Suitable emulsifiers are nonionic surfactants of low HLB viz less than about 6, e.g. glycerine monostearate and like substances. Cooling may be performed by spray cooling or by cooling Åa film of the melt on chilling rolls, or by like methods. Alternatively, the fluid dispersion may be sprayed onto the cooL spray dried base powder or onto a particulate carrier which is then dry mixed with base powder and forms part of the detergent composition. Preferably, if the nonionic detergent has been or is to be sprayed onto the base powder, the suds controlling system is preformed in particulate form, either alone or on a particulate carrier.
