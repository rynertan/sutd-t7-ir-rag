# Sealed magnetic disk data storage file.

## Abstract
A hermetically sealed, helium filled magnetic disk data storage file comprises a two part thin walled container 11 enclosing the disk file. The container body is clamped between the baseplate of the disk file and an external mounting bracket 20 which mounts the file to a frame 10 so that the container floats relative to both the frame and the baseplate. A double seamed viscoelastic seal 15 is employed for attaching the cover 11C of the container to the container body 11A .
