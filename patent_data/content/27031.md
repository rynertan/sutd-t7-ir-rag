# Non planar plastics material article and method of making the same.

## Abstract
In order to increase the strength and or reduce the amount of material in a non planar plastics material article, the starting material 1 has at least one ring of holes or depres sions 2 and is pressed so that the part 11 which is within the ring is moved generally at right angles to the plane of the ring with respect to the part 12 which is outside the ring, thereby stretching, into orientated strands 13 , zones between adja cent holes or depressions in the ring in the finished article, the strands 13 interconnect the two parts 11 , 12 . Preferably, there is a plurality of the rings and at least one annular zone 4 is left between the rings to form a hoop in the finished article.
