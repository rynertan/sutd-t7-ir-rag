# Method of forming a porous preform.

## Abstract
A porous glass optical waveguide preform 47 is formed by depositing a coating of glass particulate material on the lateral surface of a core 46 which may be a porous glass body continuously produced by the axial deposition of glass particles. The core 46 rotates and moves logitudinally in one direction with respect to two flame hydrolysis burners 40, 41 which emit streams of glass particles having different compositions. In addition, the two burners 40, 41 recipro catingly move with respect to a portion of the length of the core 46 . The speed of each burner 40, 41 varies as it traverses along its path of reciprocating motion. The thick ness of the layer produced by a burner at a given point is inversely related to the speed of the burner as it passes that point. The layers formed by the completion of a single traverse by both burners combine to form a conically shaped layer 51 , the composition of which varies from the base toward the apex thereof. The conically shaped layers 51 , which are ajacently located longitudinally along the pre form, combine to form a cylindrically shaped portion of the preform.
