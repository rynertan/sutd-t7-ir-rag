# Brake unit comprising a slack adjuster.

## Abstract
In a brake unit for a railway brake rigging a slack ad juster has been designed comprising means for releasing a pre stressed spring 35a after a stroke of a brake acti vating piston 2 , corresponding to normal slack the re leased spring is adapted to relatively move certain parts of the brake rigging to caus brake application. At increased transmitted force the force transmitting parts are clutched together. Means are provided for activating the spring also during the application of the brake in case of normal slack. This makes it possible to obtain an internal leverage in creasing the speed of the brake application relative the piston speed.
