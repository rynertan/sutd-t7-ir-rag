# Belt.

## Abstract
This belt is used as power transmission belt, timing belt and transportation belt. It has a tension section, a compression section and a load carrier layer disposed between said two sections. The load carrier of the load carrier layer is composed of polyethyleneterephthalate filament which has at least 85 mol ethyleneterephthalate as repeated unit and is at least 0.8 in ultimate viscosity, less than 0.190 in bifringence rate, less than 60 in the degree of orientation of amorphous portion and less than 15 equivalent 10‚Å∂g in terminal carboxyl group content, and said load carrier, when heated for 30 minutes at 150 C after an adhesive treatment and a heat treatment, is less than 5 in shrinkage percentage at dry heating and at least 6g denier in strength and less than 4 in elongation at a load of 2g denier.
