# Optical disc and method of recording information thereon.

## Abstract
An optical recording member 10 is prepared by coating a thin layer 11 of a colloidal dispersion of minute particles of certain transition metals or their oxides in a polymeric binder, onto a substrate 12 . The optical recording member may be made to achieve anti reflecting conditions at the writing wave length by making the substrate reflective, and by using proper thickness for the dispersion layer.
