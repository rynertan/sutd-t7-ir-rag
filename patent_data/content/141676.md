# POWER DRIVE SYSTEM

## Abstract
A power drive system for controlling the transmission of power from a prime mover such as a diesel engine 40 to a load such as the epicyclic transmission 50 of a track laying vehicle comprises an hydraulically operable multiple dry plate clutch 20 , an electro hydraulic valve 64 connected to operate the clutch, and a microprocessor control system 60 . The micro processor responds to the throttle setting by means of two L.V.D.T. sensors 61, 62 , and to the differential clutch speed by two speed sensors 66, 67 and controls a fuel pump 41 by a stepper motor 42 . During power take up, the fuel pump is set to give maximum engine torque irrespective of throttle setting, and the micro processor 60 causes the valve 64 to provide a pulse width modulated regular series of clutch actuating pressure pulses having a predetermined frequency, the pulses causing the clutch to alternate at that frequency between zero and a predetermined maximum applying force, the pulse width variable, in response to the throttle setting, between 0 and 100 of the period corres ponding to the said frequency. If the clutch fails to lock after a predetermined time, the power take up procedure is recommenced. If the clutch does lock, the pulse width is set at 100 and fuel pump control reverts to correspondence with throttle demand.
