# Continuous business form assembly.

## Abstract
A continuous business form assembly includes webs defining return envelopes within orginating envelopes, where the webs of the originating envelopes are joined through openings in the other webs. The flaps of the return envelopes are formed of the material from which the openings are cut so that the flaps and openings are simultaneously created, paper waste is reduced and return envelope size increased.
