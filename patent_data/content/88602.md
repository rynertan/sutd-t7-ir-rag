## Description
The present invention relates to a soluble fraction of a facultative organism which utilizes compounds containing one carbon atom which is capable of oxidizing a wide variety of organic compounds in the presence of a cofactor system of NADH2 or NADPH2. Among useful such organisms is a newly discovered and isolated methylotrophic microorganism strain which grows well under aerobic conditions in a culture medium in the presence of a C1 compound, preferably methane, as the major carbon and energy source. Methane utilizing microorganisms are generally known as methylotrophs . The classification system for methylotrophs proposed by R. Whittenbury et al. J. ofGen. Microbiology, 61, 205 218 1970 is the most widely recognized. In their system, the morphological characteristics of methane oxidizing bacteria are divided into five groups Methylosinus, Methylocystis,Methylomonas, Methylobacter and Methylococcus. Recently, Patt, Cole and Hanson InternationalJ. Systematic Bacteriology, 26, 2 226 229 1976 disclosed that methylotrophic bacteria are those bacteria that can grow non autotrophically using carbon compounds containing one or more carbon atoms but containing no carbon carbon bonds. Patt et al. have proposed that methylotrophs should be considered obligate if they are capable of utilizing only carbon compounds containing no carbon carbon bonds e.g., methane, methanol, dimethylether, methylamines, etc. as the sole sources of carbon and energy whereas facul tajtive methylotrophs are those organisms that can use both compounds containing no carbon carbon bonds as well as compounds having carbon carbon bonds as the sources of carbon and energy. In their paper, Patt et al. disclosed a methane oxidizing bacterium, which they identified as Methylobacterium organophilum sp nov. ATCC 27,886 . This bacterium presumably differs from all previously described genera and species of methaneoxidizing bacteria because of its ability to utilize a variety of organic substrates with carbon carbon bonds as sources of carbon and energy. Hutchinson, Whittenbury and Dalton J. Theor.Biol., 58, 325 335 1976 and Colby and Dalton J.Biochem., 157, 495 497 1976 reported that ethylene is oxidized by the soluble methane monooxygenase fromMethylococcus capsulatus Strain Bath. The latter investigators reported that the particulate membrane preparations of Methylococcus capsulatus Strain Bath did not have methane oxygenase activity as determined by the bromomethane disappearance test. Most recently, Stirling et al., J. Biochem, 96, 205 1979 and J. Gen. Microbiol., 116, 277 1980 reported that the obligate methane utilizing methylotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, contained a soluble methane mono oxygenase activity similar to that of the soluble methane monooxygenase from theMethylococcus capsulatus Strain Bath. U.K. Patent No.1,603,864 discloses a process for oxidation of selected organic substrates employing Methylococcus capsulatus orMethylosinus trichosporium as soluble fractions. The present invention is directed to a soluble fraction of a facultative organism or genetically engineered derivative thereof or natural mutant thereof grown on a C1 compound i.e., a compound containing one carbon atom which is characterized as being capable of oxidizing organic compounds in the presence of a cofactor system comprising NADH2 or NADPH2. Examples of suitable oxidations of organic compounds to their oxidation products in accordance with this invention include converting alkanes to alcohols and methyl ketones, sec. alcohols to the corresponding methyl ketones, cyclic hydrocarbons to cyclic hydrocarbyl alcohols e.g., cyclohexane to cyclohexanol , alkenes to 1,2 epoxides, styrene to styrene oxide, etc. Two suitable organisms for this purpose are of the strains Methylobacterium organophilum CRL.26 NRRL B 11,222 and Methylobacterium organophilum ATCC 27,886 . While the latter is a known organism, the former strain is a newly discovered and isolated methylotrophic microorganism strain. This strain and its natural and or artificial mutants grow well under aerobic conditions in a culture medium in the presence of a C1 compound methane or a methyl radical donating carbon containing compound as the major carbon and energy source. The enzyme active soluble fraction herein is obtained by growing the organism in a shake flask, followed by growth in a fermentor under continuous gassing with a mixture of a C1 compound and air, disintegrating the cell suspension obtained thereby, and centrifuging the disintegrated cell suspension. The supernatant solution representing the soluble fraction obtained from the centrifugation may be used to oxidize secondary alcohols to ketones in the presence of a cofactor system comprising NADH2 or NADPH2. This is in contrast to the enzyme active particulate fraction which is ordinarily obtained by growing the organism in a shake flask and harvesting the resultant organism. The term organism is used herein to include bacteria, yeast, fungi, etc., preferably bacteria, capable of oxidizing methane and methyl radical donating carbon containing compounds. The term facultative refers to organisms which can use both compounds containing no carbon carbon bonds as well as compounds having carbon carbon bonds as the sources of carbon and energy. The term genetically engineered derivatives is used herein in the sense recognized by those skilled in the art, and includes artificial mutants of the organism and recombinant DNA produced organisms such as may be produced from the plasmid DNA contained inMethylobacterium organophilum as reported by P.J. Warner et al., FEMS Microbiol. Lett., 1, 339 1977 . The term soluble fraction refers to the enzyme activity in the supernatant solution obtained on harvesting the organism after growth in a fermentor subsequent to growth in the shake flask under continuous gassing with a mixture of a C1 compound and air, when the broken cells are centrifuged at no less than 10,000 x g. for at least 15 minutes. The term increasing the oxidative state of an oxidizable organic compound is meant to include incorporating oxygen in an organic compound, such as in epoxidizing olefins and converting alkanes to alcohols or ketones or increasing the oxidative state of oxygencontaining organic compounds such as converting alcohols to aldehydes and ketones i.e., a dehydrogenating reaction . The soluble fraction obtained from methanegrown microbial cells is preferably used to oxidize alkenes to the corresponding epoxides and alcohols, alkanes to the corresponding alcohols and ketones, ethers to the corresponding alcohols and aldehydes, benzene to phenol, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. The expression cofactor system comprisingNADH2 or NADPH2 as used herein refers to a system comprised of NADH2 or NADPH2 or equivalents thereof, i.e., systems which will re generate NADH2 or NADPH2 in the oxidation process. Thus, the above expression includes a cofactor system comprising NAD , a substrate and a NAD linked dehydrogenase for the substrate, which system will regenerate NADH2 in situ. The classification system of methane oxidizing bacteria proposed by R. Whittenbury, K. C. Phillips and J. F. Wilkinson J. Gen. Microbiology, 61, 205 218 1970 hereinafter Whittenbury et al. is the most widely recognized system used today. In this system of classification, based on morphological characteristics, methane utilizing bacteria are divided into five groups. They are Methylosinus, Methylocystis, Methylomonas,Methylobacter and Methylococcus. Bacteria of these five groups reported by Whittenbury et al. utilize methane, dimethyl ether, and methanol for growth energy and they were all reported as strictly aerobic and gram negative. As one embodiment of the present invention, we have discovered and isolated a new facultative strain identified below which grows well in a culture medium in the presence of oxygen and C1 compounds i.e., methane and methyl radical donating compounds such as methanol, methylamine, methyl formate, methyl carbonate, dimethyl ether, etc. The preferred C1 compounds herein are methane and methanol, most preferably methane. This newly discovered and isolated methylotrophic microorganism strain is capable of producing microbial cells useful as feed stuffs when cultured under aerobic condi tions in a liquid growth medium comprising assimilable sources of nitrogen and essential mineral salts in the presence of methane gas or the above mentioned methylradical donating carbon containing compounds as the major carbon and energy source. As another embodiment of the invention there is provided a soluble fraction of a facultative organism or genetically engineered derivative thereof or natural mutant thereof, including the new strain mentioned above, which is capable of producing microbial cells when cultivated in an aerobic nutrient medium containing methane or the above mentioned methyl radical donating carbon containing compounds as the major carbon and energy source. The soluble fraction is obtained by aerobically growing the organism in a fermentor under continuous gassing with a mixture of a C1 compound and air. As still another embodiment of the invention there is provided a process for increasing the oxidative state of an oxidizable organic compound which comprises contacting, under aerobic conditions, in a medium comprising assimilable sources of nitrogen and essential mineral salts, the soluble fraction described above and the organic compound until at least a portion of the corresponding oxidized product is produced in isolable amounts, wherein the organism has been cultured, under aerobic conditions, in a fermentor under continuous gassing with a mixture of a C1 compound preferably methane and air, and initially carbon dioxide. A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention includes a process for producing propylene oxide from propylene by contacting propylene under aerobic conditions with the soluble fraction of a facultative organism which has been previously grown under aerobic conditions in the presence of methane. The present invention includes the following features The isolates of C1 utilizing microbes of the inven tion are facultative organisms. If the microorganism is grown in a fermentor under continuous gassing with a mixture containing methane and air, and initially carbon dioxide, after growth in a shake flask, the soluble fraction of the organism, which will oxidize substrates in the presence of a cofactor system of NADH2 or NAPDH2, will be obtained. After cell growth, the cell suspension is disintegrated and centrifuged. If grown on methane, the soluble fraction converts alkanes to alcohols and ketones, alkenes to epox ides and alcohols, ethers to alcohols, benzene to phenol, toluene to benzyl alcohol and cresol, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. The catalysts using the soluble fraction are not inhibited by such potential inhibitors as metal binding or metal chelating agents such as . bipyridyl, thiosemicarbazide, thiourea, potassium cyanide, imidazole and l,10 phenanthro line. Sulfhydryl agents such as iodoacetamide and 51,5 dithiobis 2 nitrobenzoate and acriflavin inhibit monooxygenase activity. The facultative organisms which may be employed in the present invention must utilize C1 compounds.Preferably, the organisms are of the genus Methylobacterium, and more preferably they are of the species Methylobacterium organophilum. According to the classification system described in Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Robert S. Breed et al., eds., 8th ed., Baltimore Williams Wilkins Co., 1974 , this species has the following taxonomical and morphological characteristics it produces colonies on salt agar plates in the presence of methane or methanol. The organisms are motile, rod shaped, gram negative, aerobic and grow at the expense of methane, methanol, glucose, succinate and nutrient agar. Therefore, it is classically a facultative type. It has a Type II membrane structure. A newly discovered and isolated methane and methyl radical utilizing methylotrophic facultative organism strain useful in the present invention has the following identifying characteristics Methylotrophic U.S.D.A. Agriculture Organism Research Center Strain Name ER Designation DesignationMethylobacterium CRL 26 R6 NRRL B l1,222 organophilum hereinafter CRL.26 An important characteristic of this strain is its capability to produce microbial cells white colonies in this case when cultured under aerobic conditions in a liquid growth medium comprising assimilable sources of nitrogen and essential mineral salts in the presence of methane gas or a methyl radical donating carbon containing compound such as methanol, methylamine, methyl formate, methyl carbonate, dimethyl ether, etc.as the major carbon and energy source. The above strain has been deposited at theUnited States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Northern Regional Research Laboratory NRRL , Peoria, Illinois 61604 and has received fromNRRL the individual NRRL designation as indicated above pursuant to a contract between NRRL and the assignee of this patent application Exxon Research and EngineeringCompany ER . The contract with NRRL provides for permanent availability of the progeny of this strain to the international public. This strait has been published in U.S. patent 4266034 and GB 2018822A.The assignee of the present application has agreed that, if this strain on deposit should die, or is destroyed, during the effective life of the patent, it will be replaced with a living strain of the same organism, It should be understood, however, that the availability of a deposit does not constitute a licence to practise the subject invention in derogation of patent rights granted by governmental action. The newly discovered and isolated strain of the present invention was obtained from soil samples which were screened for methylotrophic microorganisms by growth under oxygen and methane. The methylotroph was then isolated, purified, and maintained by the procedure described below. Another facultative organism strain which may be used in the present invention is Methylobacterium organophilum having ATCC designation 27,886. This strain produces pink colonies when cultured on salt agar plates in the presence of methane or methanol. Subcul tures of the strain were deposited with the depository of the American Type Culture Collection ATCC inRockville, Maryland 20852. The strain is more fully described by T. E. Patt et al., J. Bacteriol., 120, 955 1974 . The maintenance of the cultures of the organisms for use in the present invention should be carefully controlled. The preferred means for maintaining the cultures is described below in Table II. Table II MAINTENANCE OF CULTURES The organism is preferably subcultured every two weeks on mineral salts agar plates which contain medium having the following composition Na2HPO4 0.21 g NaH2PO4 0.09 g NaNO3 2.0 g MgSO4.7H2O 0.2 g KC1 0.04 g CaC12 0.015 g FeSO4.7H2O 1 mg CuSO4.5H2O 0.01 mg H3BO4 0.02 mg MnSO4.5H2O 0.14 mg ZnSO4 0.02 mg MoO3 0.02 mg Agar 15 g Water 1 liter These plates should be incubated in glass dessicators which have lids with an airtight seal and external sleeves with a tooled hose connection. Dessicators are to be evacuated and filled with a gas mixture of a C1 compound, preferably methane, and air 1 1 v v .Incubation should be at 300C. Cultures will survive in these dessicators for three months at 40C. However, frequent transfer of cultures is preferred. In commercial processes for the propagation of microorganisms, it is generally necessary to proceed by stages. These stages may be few or many, depending on the nature of the process. Ordinarily, propagation is started by inoculating cells from a slant of a culture into a pre sterilized nutrient medium usually contained in a shake flask. In the flask, growth of the microorganisms is encouraged by various means, e.g., shaking for thorough aeration, and maintenance of suitable temperature. This step or stage is repeated one or more times in flasks or vessels containing the same or larger volumes of nutrient medium. These stages may be conveniently referred to as culture development stages.The microorganism with or without accompanying culture medium, from the last development stage, may be introduced or inoculated into a large scale fermentor to produce commercial quantities of the microorganism or enzymes therefrom. Reasons for growing the microorganism in stages are manifold, but are primarily dependent upon the conditions necessary for the growth of the microorganism and or the production of enzymes therefrom.These include stability of the microorganism, proper nutrients, pH, osmotic relationships, degree of aeration, temperature and the maintenance of pure culture conditions during fermentation. For instance, to obtain maxiumum yields of the microbial cells, the conditions of fermentation in the final stage may have to be changed somewhat from those practised to obtain growth of the microorganisms in the culture development stages.Maintaining the purity of the medium, also, is an extremely important consideration, especially where the fermentation is performed under aerobic conditions as in the case of the methylotroph microorganisms. If the fermentation is initially started in a large fermentor, a relatively long period of time will be needed to achieve an appreciable yield of microorganisms aCd or oxidative and dehydrogenase enzymes therefrom. This, of course, enhances the possibility of contamination of the medium and mutation of the microorganism. The culture media used for growing the methylotrophic microorganism and inducing the oxidative enzyme system will be comprised of inorganic salts of phosphate, sulfates and nitrates as well as oxygen and a source of C1 compounds. The fermentation will generally be conducted at temperatures ranging from 5 to about 500C, preferably at temperatures ranging from about 25 to about 450C. The pH of the culture medium should be controlled at a pH ranging from about 4 to 9 and preferably from about 5.5 to 8.5 and more preferably from 6.0 to 7.5. The fermentation may be conducted at atmospheric pressures although higher pressures up to about 5 atmospheres and higher may be employed. Typically, to grow the methylotrophic microorganism and to induce the oxygenase and dehydrogenase enzymes, the microorganism is inoculated into the medium which is contacted with a gas mixture containing methane and oxygen. Methane may be supplied in the form of natural gas. For continuous flow culture the microorganisms may be grown in any suitably adapted fermentation vessel, for example, a stirred baffled fermentor or sparged tower fermentor, which is provided either with internal cooling or an external recycle cooling loop. Fresh medium may be continuously pumped into the culture at rates equivalent to 0.02 to 1 culture volume per hour and the culture may be removed at a rate such that the volume of culture remains constant.A gas mixture containing methane and oxygen and possibly carbon dioxide or other gases is contacted with the medium preferably by bubbling continuously through a sparger at the base of the vessel. The source of oxygen for the culture may be air, oxygen or oxygen enriched air. Spent gas may be removed from the head of the vessel. The spent gas may be recycled either through an external loop or internally by means of a gas inducer impeller. The gas flows and recycle should be arranged to give maximum utilization of methane. The soluble fraction of the organism having enzyme activity is obtained by further culturing the organism, after growth in a shake flask, in a fermentor under specified conditions before harvesting thereof.Thus, a sterile liquid culture medium as described above which is charged to a fermentor is inoculated with the bacteria grown in the shake flask. The inoculated mixture is stirred while a continuous constant stream of filtered air and a C1 compound, and initially carbon dioxide, is allowed to flow through the fermentor. TheC1 compound may be methane or any methyl radical donating carbon containing compound such as, e.g., methanol, methylamine, methyl formate, methyl carbonate, dimethyl ether or the like, but is preferably methane. In general, the ratio of C1 compound to air, by volume, in the gaseous mixture used for growing the cells is preferably no greater than about 1 2, and most preferably between 1 6 and 1 8, to avoid unnecessary excesses of methane. The pH of the growth medium in the fermentor is maintained in the range of 6 to 9, preferably 6 to 8, and most preferably 6 to 7, to obtain a satisfactory rate of cell growth. When these conditions are maintained, the soluble fraction rather than the particulate fraction will contain the enzyme activity. After sufficient growth of the cells, the organism is harvested. In a typical procedure the contents of the fermentor are removed and centrifuged to remove the water therefrom. The residual cellular solid is suspended in a buffer solution pH about 6 to 9 , washed, centrifuged and resuspended in the buffer solution. The cell suspension thus obtained is then disintegrated so that the cells are broken down. This is ordinarily and preferably accomplished in a French pressure cell, into which the cell suspension is injected. The pressure cell, which is a block of steel with a piston and a chamber for the suspension, exerts a high pressure e.g., up to 60 mPa or greater on the suspension, and when the cell is opened, the rapid release of pressure causes the cells to disintegrate. The disintegrated cells are separated into a particulate fraction and a supernatant solution by centrifuging the cell suspension at a force of at least 10,000 x g. for at least 15 minutes. The supernatant solution represents the soluble fraction useful in the oxidation of various organic substrates. In a preferred embodiment, the separation step is carried out by at least two centrifugation operations wherein the supernatant solution from the first operation is centrifuged at a greater centrifugation force than was used for the first centrifugation. Especially preferred is isolation of the soluble fraction by two or a series of successive centrifugations at successively greater centrifugation forces up to a maximum force representing the mechanical limitation of the machine. The enzyme active soluble fraction is then brought into contact with the desired oxidizable organic substrate, e.g., a C2 C4 alkene, e.g., ethylene, propylene, butene l or conjugated butadiene or mixtures thereof, a cyclic compound such as cyclohexane, an alkane such as methane, ethane, propane or butane, etc., or a secondary alcohol, e.g., 2 propanol or 2 butanol in the presence of oxygen and a buffer solution or nutrient medium e.g., the same nutrient medium used to produce the microorganism may be used except that the oxidizable substrate material has replaced the methane and the mixture is incubated until the desired degree of conversion has been obtained. Thereafter, the oxidized product is recovered by conventional means, e.g., distillation, etc. The soluble fraction may be used to catalyze the oxidation of several oxidizable organic compounds, including oxidation of alkenes to the corresponding epoxides, e.g., ethylene to ethylene oxide, propylene to propylene oxide, l butene to 1,2 epoxybutane, butadiene to 1,2 epoxybutene, isobutene to epoxyisobutane, cisbut 2 ene to cis 2,3 epoxybutane and cis 2 buten 1 ol, trans but 2 ene to trans 2,3 epoxybutane, etc., preferably, linear, branched, substituted, terminal or internal olefins.The soluble fraction also promotes oxidation of linear and branched alkanes to the corresponding primary, secondary or tertiary alcohols, such as, e.g., methane to methanol, ethane to ethanol, propane to l propanol and 2 propanol, butane to l butanol and 2 butanol, pentane to l pentanol and 2 pentanol, hexane to l hexanol and 2 hexanol, heptane to l heptanol and 2 heptanol, octane to l octanol and 2 octanol, isobutane to isobutanol and tert butanol, cyclohexane to cyclohexanol, toluene to benzyl alcohol and cresol, etc., preferably linear, branched, cyclic or aryl alkanes.Additional oxidation reactions include oxidation of ethers to the corresponding alcohols and aldehydes such as, e.g., dimethylether to methanol and formaldehyde substituted alkanes to aldehydes such as, e.g., chloro , bromo , or fluoromethanes to formaldehyde, oxidized dihalomethanes, and oxidized trihalomethanes esters to the corresponding aldehydes, such as, e.g., methylformate to formaldehyde benzene to phenol and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide. The oxidation reactions using the soluble fraction must take place under aerobic conditions in the presence of a cofactor system comprising nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in the reduced form NADH2 or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in the reduced form NADPH2 . The cofactor which is initially present in the cell fraction is ordinarily removed therefrom during the purification process and must be replenished to effect oxidation using the soluble fraction. The pH of the oxidation reaction using the soluble fraction may range from 6 to 9, depending mainly on the substrate used, preferably 6 8, most preferably 6 7, and the temperature may range from about 20 800C, preferably 30 500C, depending mainly on the substrate employed. The NADH2 cofactor system herein may be prepared by adding NADH2 exogenously to the oxidation reaction mixture containing the soluble fraction or it may be generated and or regenerated in situ. In the latter case, an NAD linked dehydrogenase enzyme and its substrate may be used in the presence of NAD to produce NADH2 as election donor for the enzyme. Examples of preferred cofactor systems for re generation ofNADH2 include a system of formate and NAD with theNAD linked formate dehydrogenase present in the soluble fraction , a system of formaldehyde, NAD and formaldehyde dehydrogenase, or a system of a secondary alcohol, such as 2 butanol, NAD , and an NAD linked secondary alcohol dehydrogenase. The latter three systems are found to increase the rate of reaction two to eight fold over the rate when NADH2 is added exogenously. To facilitate the necessary effective contact of oxygen and the enzyme, it is preferred, for best results, to introduce a strong, finely divided air stream into a vigorously stirred dispersion of substrate in the oxidation medium that generally contains water, and a buffer in which the enzyme preparation or microorganism culture is suspended. The enzyme preparation may then be separated from the liquid medium, preferably by filtration or centrifugation. The resulting oxidized product may then generally be obtained. The process of the invention may be carried out batchwise, semicontinuously, continuously, concurrently or countercurrently. Optionally, the suspension containing the enzyme preparation or methylotrophic microorganism and buffer solution is passed downwardly with vigorous stirring countercurrently to an air stream rising in a tube reactor. The top layer is removed from the downflowing suspension, while culture and remaining buffer solution constituents are recycled, at least partly, with more oxidative substrate and addition of fresh enzyme preparation or methylotrophic microorganism, as required. The growth of the methylotrophic microorganism and the oxidation process may be conveniently coupled by conducting them simultaneously, but separately and using much higher aeration in the oxidation process e.g., an air excess of at least twice that required for growth, preferably at least five times as much aeration .Both the growth process and the methane hydroxylation or oxidation processes may be conducted in the same reactor in sequential or simultaneous operations by alternate use of normal and strong aeration. The oxidation reaction should not be carried out in the presence of a substrate competing for the same enzyme system, and thus, none of the oxidation reactions should be carried out in the presence of methane except, of course, when methane is the substrate being oxidized to methanol. The invention is illustrated further by the following examples which, however, are not to be taken as limiting in any respect. All parts and percentages, unless expressly stated otherwise, are by weight.EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Soluble Fraction of Methane Monooxygenase From Facultative Methylobacterium Organophilum CRL.26 The facultative methane utilizing organism,Methylobacterium organophilum CRL.26 , was isolated from soil samples by enrichment culture using methane methane and air, 50 50 parts by volume as a carbon source, as described in Patel et al., J. Bacteriol, 136, 352 1978 . The organisms were maintained on mineral salts agar plates in a dessicator under an atmosphere of 1 1 by volume of methane air at 300C. The organisms were grown on a small scale at 300C in 2.8 1 flasks containing 800 ml of mineral salts medium with methane 1 1 parts by volume methane air as the sole carbon and energy source. Cells were harvested after 24 28 hours by centrifugation at 10,000 x g. for 15 min. Large scale cultures were grown on methane 10 methane, 15 carbon dioxide and 75 air at 300C in batch culture on a mineral salt medium in a 30 explosion resistant fermentor. The fermentor was inoculated with 2t of a culture grown in flasks. The cells were washed twice with 25 millimolar potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and suspended in 25 millimolar potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 5 millimolar MgC12 and deoxyribonuclease 0.05 mg ml . Cell suspensions at 40C were disintegrated by a single passage through a French pressure cell American Instruments Co., Silver Spring, Md at 60 mpa. Disintegrated cell suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000 x g. for 15 min. to remove unbroken cells.The supernatant solution was then centrifuged at 40,000 x g. for 60 min., yielding particulate pallet P 40 and soluble S 40 fractions. The soluble fraction was subsequently centrifuged at 80,000 x g. for 60 min., yielding particulate P 80 and soluble S 80 fractions.EXAMPLE 2 Hydroxylation of n Alkanes Several 3.0 ml vials at 40C were filled with 0.5 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 25 micromoles potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 10 micromolesNADH2, and the soluble S 80 fraction obtained as described in Example 1 or Methylococcus capsulatus StrainBath as a comparison. The vials were incubated at 350C on a reciprocating water bath shaker at 50 oscillations per minute. The gaseous phase of the vials was evacuated by vacuum and replaced with a 1 to 1 by volume gaseous mixture of the alkane substrate indicated in Table III to oxygen, at which point the reaction was initiated. The rate of oxidation of the alkanes was measured by injecting 1 2 1 1 samples of the reaction mixture into a gas chromatograph immediately after addition of substrate zero time and after 5 and 10 min. of incubation. Specific activities were expressed as nmoles of product formed per min. per mg. of protein, with the higher number representing better conversion.With each substrate, control experiments were conducted in the absence of NADH2, in the absence of oxygen, and using boiled extracts. The alcohol products were identified and estimated by retention time comparisons and co chromatography with authentic standards using flame ionization gas chromatography. The column temperature was maintained isothermally between 800C and 2000C with helium carrier gas flow rates of 20 40 ml per min. The amount of product formed was estimated from peak areas using a standard graph constructed using authentic compounds. Duplicate measurements were carried out for each substrate. Protein concentrations in cellular fractions were estimated with Folin Ciocalteu reagent as described by O.H. Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193, 265 1951 , using bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Specific activities were expressed as the amount of substrate utilized per minute per mg of protein in the 5 80 fractions. Controls were used as described in Example 2.

It is seen that there are many differences in oxidation rates of alkanes, substituted alkanes, and alkenes when the soluble fraction containing methane monooxygenase from facultative methylotroph Methylobacterium organophilum CRL.26 is employed rather than the soluble methane monooxygenase fraction from obligate methylotroph Methylococcus capsulatus Strain bath.

The various cofactor systems, concentration thereof, and rates of conversion are indicated in Table VIII. As can be seen, only NADH2 and NADPH2 were suitable as electron donors.The remainder of electron donors, many known to be replacements for NADH2 in other particulate and soluble methane monooxygenase systems, were ineffective. For example, formaldehyde in the absence of NAD could act as an electron donor for the soluble methane monooxygenase fraction of the obligate methylotroph Methylococcus capsulatus Strain Bath.

Reactions were initiated by gassing the vials with propylene. 8 Hydroxyquinoline, which strongly inhibits soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylococcus capsulatus Bath and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b , was not inhibitory to soluble methane monooxygenase from Methylobacterium organophilum CRL.26 . i,o Bipyridyl and 1,10 phenanthroline, which inhibited about 30 activity of Methylobacterium organophilum CRL.26 , did not inhibit the activity of Methylococcus capsulatus Bath .

EXAMPLE 10 Resolution of Soluble Fraction Into Its Components The soluble S 80 fraction 20 ml fromExample 1 was loaded on a diethylaminoethyl DEAE cellulose column 0.9 x 30 cm equilibrated with 25mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 5mM MgC12 and 5mM dithiothreitol buffer A . Proteins not adsorbed to DEAE cellulose fraction A were eluted with buffer A. The column was then eluted with successive 25 ml batches of buffer A containing 0.2M NaCl, and 0.5MNaCl. Fractions from the 0.2M NaC1 eluate fraction B having a dark brown color were combined. Fractions from the 0.5M NaC1 eluate fraction C with a yellow color were also combined. The specific activities of the S 80 fraction before resolution, of each fraction separately, of two combined fractions, and of the three combined fractions were measured as described in Example 2 for conversion of propylene to propylene oxide. The results are indicated in Table XI.

The various cofactor systems, concentrations thereof, and rates of conversion are indicated in Table XII. As can be seen, of the systems tested, only NADH2 NADPH2 formate andNAD formaldehyde, NAD and formaldehyde dehydrogenase and secondary butanol in the presence of secondary alcohol dehydrogenase SADH from yeast Pichia sp. andNAD were suitable as cofactor systems. The remainder of the cofactor systems, many known to be electron donor replacements for NADH2 in other particulate and soluble methane monooxygenase systems, were ineffective.

It can be seen that the rates of both the epoxidation and hydroxylation reactions increased two to four fold using NAD and formate to regenerateNADH2 rather than using NADH2 itself as the electron donor.

Hanson at the Gray Freshwater BiologicalInstitute, University of Minnesota, Navarre, Minnesota.It was maintained on mineral salts agar plates in a dessicator under an atmosphere of 1 1 by volume of methane air at 30oC. The organisms were grown and harvested as described in Example 1. The soluble fraction was obtained as described in Example 1 except that after centrifugation at 40,000 x g. for 60 min. to yield the particulate P 40 and soluble S 40 fractions, the S 40 fraction was subsequently centrifuged at 80,000 x g. for 120 min., yielding particulate P 80 and soluble S 80 fractions. EXAMPLE 15 Hydroxylation of n Alkanes Several 3.0 ml vials at 40C were filled with 0.5 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 50 micromoles potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 10 micromolesNADH2, and, as the remainder, the soluble S 80 fraction obtained as described in Example 14.

CRL.26 . Specific activites for dehydrogenase reactions were expressed as nmoles of methylketone or 2 butanone formed min mg of purified SADH from yeast. The vials were incubated at 350C on a reciprocating water bath shaker at 50 oscillations per minute..The gaseous phase of the vials was evacuated by vacuum and replaced with a gaseous mixture consisting of 1 1 by volume oxygen the alkane substrate indicated in TableXVIII, at which point the reaction was initiated. The rate of oxidation of the alkane substrates was measured either by estimation of products formed or by amount of substrate utilized from the gas or liquid phase. In the former case, 1 2 A 1 samples of the reaction mixture were injected into a gas chromatograph immediately after addition of substrate zero time and after 4 and 8 min. of incubation. Specific activities were expressed as nmoles of product formed per min.per mg of protein, with the higher number representing better conversion. If substrate utilization was the measure of oxidation rate, 2 X1 of liquid or 50 Atl of gas was injected into the gas chromatograph at zero time and after 4 and 8 min. of incubation of the reaction mixture at 350C, and specific activities were expressed as the amount of substrate utilized per min. per mg. of protein. Regardless of the procedure employed, control experiments were conducted for each substrate in the absence of NADH2, in the absence of oxygen, and using boiled extracts. The alcohol products were identified and estimated by retention time comparisons and co chromatography with authentic standards using flame ionization gas chromatography. The column temperature was maintained isothermally between 800C and 1300C with helium carrier gas flow rates of 20 40 ml per min. The amount of product formed was estimated from peak areas using a standard graph constructed using authentic compounds. Duplicate measurements were carried out for each substrate. Protein concentrations in cellular fractions were estimated with Folin Ciocalteu reagent as described by O.H. Lowry et al., supra, using bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Ascorbate or methanol in the presence of methanol dehydrogenase, however, could not replace NADH2 as an electron donor. The soluble methane monooxygenase fractions from the obligate methane utilizing bacteria, Methylococcus capsulatus Strain Bath and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, were disclosed for use in oxidation processes in U.K. Pat. 1,603,864. The soluble monooxygenase fraction from facultative methylotrophic organisms such as Methylobacterium organophilum ATCC 27,886 and the newly discovered facultative strainMethylobacterium organophilum CRL.26 has now been isolated and is discovered as capable of oxidizing an oxidizable organic substrate under aerobic conditions in the presence of a cofactor system of NADH2 or NADPH2. The fraction of the CRL.26 strain is further found to have different oxidation rates from those of the soluble fraction of Methylococcus capsulatus Strain Bath for a given substrate e.g., higher conversion rates ofC6 Cg alkanes and to behave differently with respect to potential electron donors cofactors and inhibitors of activity.
