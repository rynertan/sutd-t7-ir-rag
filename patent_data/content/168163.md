# Electro pneumatic converter.

## Abstract
An electro pneumatic converter includes a reversible d c servo motor 40 having a pair of terminals 58,60 connected to a pair of lines 34,36 . The lines 34,36 are selectively connectable to a common terminal 64 of a power supply. A power terminal 32 of the power supply is connected over a variable resistor 80 to a terminal 78 connecting the lines 34,36 . Selectively connecting one of the lines 34,36 to the common terminal 64 causes electrical power to pass through the motor 40 to turn a shzift of the motor in a selected one of two directions of rotation. The speed of rotation is determined by the position of the variable resistor 80 . The motor shaft is used in conjunction with a cam 46 that is associated with a nozzle 48 supplied with pressu rised gas over a bellows 50 . The nozzle 48 is moved closer to or further away from an edge of the cam 46 as the bellows 50 expands or contracts. A line 38 connected upstream of the bellows 50 provides gas at a selected pressure which is proportional to the position of the cam 46 . The position of the cam 46 is determined by the rotation of the shaft of the motor 40 .
