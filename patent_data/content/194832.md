# IMPROVED BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
An improved bipolar transistor structure having an emitter region formed over a base region, and a thin wall of insulating material, such as a thermal oxide, along the edges of the emitter region. The wall of insulating material electrically isolates emitter and base contact areas, and greatly reduces the size of inactive portions of the base region, thereby reducing the base resistance and base collector capacitance, and increasing the speed of operation of the transistor. The emitter region comprises a first layer of arsenic doped polycrystalline silicon poly and a second layer of phosphorous doped semi insulating polycrystalline silicon SIPOS , to provide the best combination of desirable device characteristics.
