# Ganglioside derivatives.

## Abstract
A novel mono sialo ganglioside derivative substantially identical chemically and physically with a product prepared by a concentration of an aqueous solution of a mono sialo ganglioside and clacium ions under sub atmospheric press ure at 40 80 C for 18 240 hours, b adjustment of the pH to 2 3, followed by dialysis, and c evaporation of the aqueous solvent. The novel ganglioside is believed to be a new physical form of the known ganglioside G
