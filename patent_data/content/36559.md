## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to electronic language learning aids, teaching machines and electronic training aids. More specifically, this invention relates to electronic language learning aids, teaching machines and electronic training aids having means for producing synthesized speech. The prior art suggests various techniques for synthesizing human speech from digital data. For instance, some of the techniques used are briefly described in VoiceSignals Bit by Bit at pages 28 34 of the October 1973 issue of IEEE Spectrum. An important technique for synthesizing human speech, and the techniques used by the speech synthesizer chip described herein, is called linear predictive coding. For a detailed discussion of this technique, see Speech Analysis and Synthesis by Linear Prediction of the Speech Wave by B.S. Atal and Suzanne L. Hanauer which appears at pp. 637 50 of Volume 50, number 2 part 2 of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. In U.S. Patent Application S N 905,328, entitled Lattice Filter Waveform or Speech Synthesis Circuits UsingDigital Logics describes a lattice filter capable of being implemented on a single semiconductor chip. The learning aid described herein makes use of the lattice filter described in the aformentioned U.S. Patent Application. It is one object of this invention that a learning aid be equipped to audibly pronounce words in a human language. It is another object of this invention that the words and phrases which the learning aid is equipped to audibly pronounce be randomly accessible. It is yet another object of this invention that learning aid circuits be implemented on a miniature semiconductor chip so that the entire learning aid is constructable as a portable device. The foregoing objects are achieved as is now described. The words to be pronounced by the machine are stored as digital codes in a memory device. This memory is preferably of the non volatile type so that the words are not erased when power is disconnected from the apparatus.A speech synthesizer circuit is connected to the output of the memory for converting the signals stored therein to audible speech. Several types of speech synthesis circuits are known. In a disclosed embodiment, the speech synthesizer is implemented using linear predictive coding and integrated on a single semiconductor chip. A speaker is provided to convert output from the speech synthesizer to audible sounds. A keyboard and display, both of which preferably are capable of accommodating alphanumeric characters, are preferably provided. The display and keyboard are preferably coupled to the speech synthesis circuit and memory via a controller circuit. In the embodiment disclosed, the controller s function is provided by an appropriately programmed microprocessor device.The controller circuit controls the memory to read out the digital signals corresponding to the words and phrases to be pronounced, the words and phrases preferably being randomly selectable from a plurality of words stored therein. The words and phrases are converted to audible signals by means of the synthesizer circuit in combination with the speaker. When the operator selects a word to be pronounced by inputting a word at the keyboard, the controller compares the inputted word with the words stored in the memory and the operator is informed of the appropriate pronounciation of the selected word. The operator may be so informed audibly via the speech synthesis circuit and speaker. Of course, the particular words selected for any given library is a design choice. The learning aid is installed in an easily portable case.The size of the speech synthesis chip is on the order of 45,000 square mils using conventional MOS design rules and a convention P MOS processing technique. Of course, using C MOS processing would tend to increase the size of the chip somewhat. In an embodiment disclosed, the learning aid is preferably equipped with other modes of operation which are described in detail.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION FIGURE 1 is a front view of an electronic learning aid of the type which may embody the present invention. The learning aid includes a case 1 which encloses electronic circuits preferably implemented on integrated circuits not shown in this figure . These circuits are coupled to a display 2, a keyboard 3 and a speaker 4 or other voice coil means also not shown in FIGURE 1 . However, the openings are shown behind which speaker 4 is preferably mounted.The display is preferably of the vacuum fluorescent type in the embodiment to be described however, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other display means, such as arrays of light emitting diodes, liquid crystal devices, electrochromic devices, gas discharge devices, plasma displays or cathode ray tube displays, the latter two being better suited for simultaneous rather than sequential operation.Also, in this embodiment, as a matter of design choice, the display has ten character positions. The keyboard 3 of the learning aid of this embodiment has forty key switch positions, twenty six of which are used to input the letters of the alphabet into the learning aid. Of the remaining fourteen key switch positions, six are utilized for mode keys word zap on, hear it, read it, picture read, letter stumpers and word maker , another six in its modes go, enter, erase, module select, replay and word zapper key and the remaining two comprise an apostrophe key and an off key. The words spoken by the learning aid, as well as the correct spelling of those words, are stored as digital information in one or more Read Only Memories. The learning aid depicted in FIGURE 1 may be battery powered or powered from a source of external electrical power, as desired. The case is preferably made from injection molded plastic and the keyboard switches may be provided by arrays of key switches of the type disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 4,005,293, if desired. Of course, other types of case materials or switches alternatively may be used. Having described the outward appearance of the learning aid, the modes in which the learning aid may operate will be first described followed by a description of the block diagrams and detailed logic diagrams of the various electronic circuits used to implement the learning aid of FIGURE 1. MODES OF OPERATION The first mode, the word zap mode, is entered by pressing the word zap on key. The word zap mode causes the learning aid to audibly pronounce a word within the phrase Zap the word . A series of confusingly similar words is then visually displayed. When the pronounced word is displayed the operator indicates his recognition of it by depressing the word zapper key. Appropriate reward or error phrases are then audibly pronounced. This mode of operation is effective in teaching reading skills which a nonspeaking learning aid could not implement. An example of the word zap mode can be seen in Table I. The hear it mode allows the operator to enter a word via the alphabet keys. After the word has been entered by depressing the enter key the learning aid will audibly pronounce the entered word, if it is contained in the nonvolatile memory. Unlike a dictionary or simple visual translator device, this mode of operation teaches correct pronounciation without having to utilize complete complex phonetic symbols. An example of the hear it mode can be seen in Table II. The read it mode presents an audible phrase to the operator containing a missing word. Various possible words are then presented visibly. The operator selects the proper word to complete the phrase. Entry of the proper word will generate an appropriate reward phrase. An example of the read it phrase can be seen in Table III. In the picture read mode, the learning aid audibly directs the operator to an appropriate picture in an accompanying text. The operator must then correctly enter the spelling of the object pictured to generate the reward phrase. An example of the picture read mode can be seen inTable IV. In the letter stumper mode the learning aid audibly pronounces a letter of the alphabet. Upon entry of that letter, at the keyboard, by the operator, an additional letter is pronounced and is added to the sequence. The operator must correctly enter the entire incremented sequence.This mode teaches auditory memory functions. In addition to memory functions, this mode teaches recognition of alphabet letters in conjunction with the correct pronounciation of the letters. If the operator correctly enters the proper sequence of letters after some nominal number of incrementations, an appropriate reward phrase is generated. An example of the letter stumper mode can be seen in Table V. In the word maker mode of operation phonetic skills are taught. A syllable is pronounced audibly and the operator is audibly told to add a letter to the syllable to form a specific word. A correct choice of alphabet keys will cause the learning aid to pronounce the formed word.This mode of operation will teach the basic phonetic skills necessary to form simple words. An example of the word maker mode can be seen in Table VI. Referring now to FIGURE 2, there is shown a preferred arrangement of the segments of display 2. Display 2 preferably has eight character positions each of which is provided by a sixteen segment character which has fourteen segments arranged somewhat like a British flag with an additional two segments for an apostrophe and a decimal point.In FIGURE 2, segments a n are arranged more or less in the shape of the British flag while segment ap provides apostrophe and segment dpt provides a decimal point. Segment conductors Sa through Sn, SDP and Sap are respectively coupled to segments a through n, dpt and ap in the eight character positions of display 2. Also, for each character position, there is a common electrode, labeled ad D1 D8.When display 2 is provided by a vacuum fluorescent display device, the segments electrodes are provided anodes in the vacuum fluorescent display device, while each common electrode is preferably provided by a grid associated with each character position. By appropriately multiplexing signals on the segment conductors Sa Sn, Sdpt and Sap with signals on the character common electrodes D1 D8 the display may be caused to show the various letters of the alphabet, a period, and an apostrophe and various numerals. For instance, by appropriately energizing segment conductors A, B, C, E and F when character common electrode D1 is appropriately energized, the letter A is actuated in the first character position of display 2.Further, by appropriate strobing segment conductors A, B, C, D, H, I and J when character common electrode D2 is appropriately energized, the letter B is caused to be actuated in the second character position of display 2.It should be evident to those skilled in the art that the other letters of the alphabet as well as the apostrophe, period and numerals may be formed by appropriate energization of appropriate segment conductors and common electrodes.In operation, the character common electrodes D1 D8 are sequentially energized with an appropriate voltage potential as selected segment conductors are energized to their appropriate voltage potential to produce a display of characters at display 2. Of course, the segment electrodes could alternatively be sequentially energized as the digit electrodes are selectively energized in producing a display at display 2. BLOCK DIAGRAM OF THE LEARNING AID FIGURE 3 is a block diagram of the major components making up the disclosed embodiment of an electronic learning aid. The electronics of the disclosed learning aid may be divided into three major functional groups, one being a controller 11, another being a speech synthesizer 10, and another being a read only memory ROM 12. In the embodiment disclosed, these major electronic funtional groups are each integrated on separate integrated circuit chips except for the ROM functional group which is integrated onto two integrated circuit chips. Thus, the speech synthesizer 10 is preferably implemented on a single integrated circuit denoted by the box labeled 10 in FIGURE 3 while the controller is integrated on a separate integrated circuit denoted by a box 11 in FIGURE 3.The word list for the learning aid is stored in the ROM functional group 12, which stores both the correct spellings of the words as well as frames of digital coding which are converted by speech synthesizer 10 to an electrical signal which drives speaker or other voice coil means 4. In the embodiment disclosed, ROM functional group 12 is preferably provided with 262,144 bits of storage. As a matter of design choice, the 262,144 bits of data are divided between two separate read only memory chips, represented in FIGURE 3 at numerals 12a and 12b. The memory capability of ROM functional group 12 is a design choice however, using the data compression features which are subsequentially discussed with reference to FIGURE 6, the 262,144 bits of read only memory may be used to store on the order of 250 words of spoken speech and their correct spellings. Of course, the number of chips on which the learning aid is implemented is a design choice and as large scale integration techniques are improved using electron beam etching and other techniques , the number of integrated circuit chips may be reduced from four to as few as a single chip. Synthesizer chip 10 is interconnected with the read only memories via data path 15 and is interconnected with controller 11 via data path 16. The controller 11, which may be provided by an appropriately programmed microprocessor type device, preferably actuates display 2 by providing segment information on segment conductors Sa Sn, Sdpt and Sap along with character position information on connectors D1 D8. In the embodiment herein disclosed, controller 11 preferably also provides filament power to display 2 when a vacuum fluorescent device is used therefor. Of course, if a liquid crystal, electrochromographic, light emitting diode or gas discharge display were used such filament power would not be required. One technique for generating filament power on a controller chip is described in U.S. Patent Application S N 843,017 filed October 17, 1977.Controller 11 also scans keyboard 3 for detecting key depressions thereat.Keyboard 3 has forty switch positions which are shown in representative form in FIGURE 3, the switch locations occurring where the conductors cross within the dashed line at numeral 3 in FIGURE 3. A switch closure causes the conductors shown as crossing in FIGURE 3 to be coupled together. At numeral 3 the switch occurring at a crossing of conductors at numeral 3 is shown in detail. In addition to actuating display 2 and sensing key depression at keyboard 3, controller 11 also perform such functions as providing addresses for addressing ROMs 12a and 12b via synthesizer 10 , and other such functions which will become apparent. Addresses from controller 11 are transmitted to ROMs 12a b by synthesizer 10 because, as will be seen, synthesizer 10 preferably is equipped with buffers capable of addressing a plurality of read only memories.Preferably, only one of the pairs ofROMs will output information in response to this addressing because of a chip select signal which is transmitted from synthesizer 10 to all the Read Only Memories. Controller 11, in this embodiment, transmits addresses to the ROMs via synthesizer 10 so that only synthesizer 10 output buffers need be sized to transmit addresses to a plurality of ROMs simultaneously. Of course, controller 11 output buffers could also be sized to transmit information to a plurality of read only memories simultaneously and thus in certain embodiments it may be desirable to also couple controller 11 directly to the ROMs. As will be seen, synthesizer chip 10 synthesizes human speech or other sounds according to frames of data stored in ROMs 12a 12b or 13a or 13b. The synthesizer 10 employs a digital lattice filter of the type described in U.S. Patent Application S N 905,328, filed May 12, 1978. U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 905,328 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion of the speech synthesizer assumes that the reader has a basic understand ing of the operation of the lattice filter described in U.S. Patent Application S N 905,328 therefore, the reader is encouraged to read that patent before delving into the following detailed discussion of the speech synthesizer. As will also be seen, synthesizer 10 also includes a digital to analog D to A converter for converting the digital output from the lattice filter to analog signals for driving speaker 4 or other voice coil means with those analog signals.Synthesizer 10 also includes timing, control and data storage and data compression systems which will be subsequently described in detail. SYNTHESIZER BLOCK DIAGRAM FIGURES 4a and 4b form a composite block diagram of the synthesizer 10. Synthesizer 10 is shown as having six major functional blocks, all but one of which are shown in greater detail in block diagram form in FIGURES 4a and 4b.The six major functional blocks are timing logic 20 ROMController interface logic 21 parameter loading, storage and decoding logic 22 parameter interpolator 23 filter and excitation generator 24 and D to A and output section 25.Subsequentially, these major functional blocks will be described in detail with respect to FIGURES 6, 7a d, 8a f, 9a d, 10a c, 11a d, and 12a b.Rom Controller Interface Logic Referring again to FIGURES 4a and 4b, ROM Controller interface logic 21 couples synthesizer 10 to read onlymemories 12a and 12b and to controller 11. The control 1 8 CTL1 CTL8 , chip select CS and processor data clock PDC pins are coupled, in this embodiment, to the controller while the address 1 8 ADD1 ADD8 and instruction 0 1 10 11 pins are connected to ROMs 12a and 12b as well as ROMs 13a 13b, if used . ROM Controller interface logic 21 sends address information from controller 11 to the Read Only Memories 12a 12b and preferably returns digital information from theROMs back to the controller 12 logic 21 also brings data back from the ROMs for use by synthesizer 10 and initiates speech.A Chip Select CS signal enables tristate buffers, such as buffers 213, and a three bit command latch 210. AProcessor Data Clock PDC signal sets latch 210 to hold the data appearing at CTL1 CTL4 pins from the controller.Command latch 210 stores a three bit command from controller 11, which is decoded by command decoder 211. Command decoder 211 is responsive to eight commands which are speak SPK or speak slowly SPKSLOW for causing the synthesizer to access data from the Read Only Memory and speak in response thereto either at a normal rate or at a slow rate a reset RST command for resetting the synthesizer to zero a test talk TTALK so that the controller can ascertain whether or not the synthesizer is still speaking a load address LA where four bits are received from the controller chip at theCTL1 CTL8 pins and transferred to the ROMs as an address digit via the ADD1 ADD8 pins and associated buffers 211 a read and branch RB command which causes the Read Only Memory to take the contents of the present and subsequent address and use that for a branch address a read RE command which causes the Read Only Memory to output one bit of data on ADD1, which data shifts into a four bit data input register 212 and an output command which transfers four bits of data in the data input register 212 to controller 11 via buffers 213 and the CTL1 CTL8 pins. Once the synthesizer 10 has commenced speaking in response to a SPK or SPKSLOW command it continues speaking until ROM interface logic 21 encounters aRST command or an all ones gates 207 see FIG. 7a 7d detects an energy equal to fifteen code and resets talk latch 216 in response thereto. As will be seen, an energy equal to 15 code is used as the last frame of data in a plurality of frames of data for generating words, phases or sentences. TheLA, RE and RB commands decoded by decoder 211 are re encoded via ROM control logic 217 and transmitted to the read only memories via the instruction 10 11 pins. The processor Data Clock PDC signal serves other purposes than just setting latch 210 with the data on CTL1CTL4. It signals that an address is being transferred viaCTL1 CTL8 after an LA or output command has been decoded or that the TTALK test is to be performed and outputted on pinCTL8. A pair of latches 218A and B FIGURES 7a 7d associated with decoder 211 disable decoder 211 when the aforementioned LA, TSTTALK and OUTPUT commands have been decoded and a subsequent PDC occurs so that the data then on pins CTL1CTL8 is not decoded. A TALK latch 216 is set in response to a decodedSPK or SPKSLW command and is reset 1 during a power up clear PUC which automatically occurs whenever the synthesizer is energized 2 by a decoded RST command or 3 by an energy equals fifteen code in a frame of speech data.The TALKD output is delayed output to permit all speech parameters to be inputed into the synthesizer before speech is attempted. The talk slow latch 215 is set in response to a decoded SPKSLOW command and reset in the same manner as latch 216. The SLOWD output is similarly a delayed output to permit all the parameters to be inputted into the synthesizer before speech is attempted.Parameter Loading, Storage and Decoding Logic The parameter loading, storage and decoding logic 22 includes a six bit long parameter input register 205 which receives serial data from the read only memory via pin ADD1 in response to a RE command outputted to the selected readonly memory via the instruction pins. A coded parameter random access memory RAM 203 and condition decoders and latches 208 are connected to receive the data inputted into the parameter input register 205. As will be seen, each frame of speech data is inputted in three to six bit portions via parameter input register 205 to RAM 203 in a coded format where the frame is temporarily stored. Each of the coded pa rameters stored in RAM 203 are converted to a ten bit parameter by parameter ROM 202 and temporarily stored in a parameter output register 201. As will be discussed with respect to FIGURE 6, the frames of data may be either wholly are partially inputted into parameter input register 205, depending upon the length of the particular frame being inputted. Condition decoders and latches 208 are responsive to particular portions of the frame of data for setting repeat, pitch equal zero, energy equal zero, old pitch and old energy latches. The function of these latches will be discussed subsequently with respect to FIGURES 7a 7d. The condition decoders and latches 208 as well as various timing signals are used to control various interpolation control gates 209.Gates 209 generate an inhibit signal when interpolation is to be inhibited, a zero parameter signal when the parameter is to be zeroed and a parameter load enable signal which, among other things, permits data in parameter input register 205 to be loaded into the coded parameter RAM 203.Parameter Interpolater The parameters in parameter output registers 201 are applied to the parameter interpolator functional block 23. The inputted K1 K10 speech parameters, including speech energy are stored in a K stack 302 and E10 loop 304, while the pitch parameter is stored in a pitch register 305. The speech parameters and energy are applied via recoding logic 301 to array multiplier 401 in the filter and excitation generator 24.As will be seen, however, when a new parameter is loaded into parameter output register 201 it is not immediately inserted into K stack 302 or E10 loop 304 or register 305 but rather the corresponding value in K stack 302,E10 loop 304 or register 305 goes through eight interpolation cycles during which a portion of the difference between the present value in the K stack, E10 loop 304 or register 305 and the target value of that parameter in parameter output register 201 is added to the present value in K stack 203, E10 loop 304 or register 305. Essentially the same logic circuits are used to perform the interpolation of pitch, energy and the KI K10 speech parameters. The target value from the parameter output register 201 is applied along with the present value of the corresponding parameter to a subtractor 308. A selector 307 selects either the present pitch from pitch logic 306 or present energy or K coefficient data from KE10 transfer register 303, according to which parameter is currently in parameter output register 201, and applies the same to subtractor 308 and a delay circuit 309. As will be seen, delay circuit 309 may provide anywhere between zero delay to three bits of delay. The output of delay circuit 309 as well as the output of subtractor 308 is supplied to an adder 310 whose output is applied to a delay circuit 311.When the delay associated with delay circuit 309 is zero the target value of the particular parameter in parameter output register 201 is effectively inserted into K stack 302, E10 loop 304 or pitch register 305, as is appropriate. The delay in delay circuit 311 is three to zero bits, being three bits when the delay in the delay circuit 309 is zero bits, whereby the total delay through selector, 307 delay, 309 and 311, adder 310 and subtractor 308 is constant. By controlling the delays in delay circuit 309 and 311, either all, 1 2, 1 4 or 1 8 of the difference outputted from subtractor 308 that being the difference between the target value and the present value is added back into the present value of the parameter. By controlling the delays in the fashion set forth in Table VII, a relatively smooth eight step parameter interpolation is accomplished. U.S. Patent application S.N. 905,328 discusses with reference to FIGURE 7 thereof a speech synthesis filter wherein speech coefficients K1 K9 are stored in the K stack continuously, until they are updated while the K10 coefficient and the speech energy referred to by the letter A inU.S. Patent Application S.N. 905,328 are periodically exchanged. In parameter interpolator 23, speech coefficientsK1 K9 are likewise stored in stack 302, until they are updated, whereas the energy parameter and the K10 coefficient effectively exchange places in K stack 302 during a twenty time period cycle of operations in the filter and excitation generator 24. To accomplish this function, E10 loop 304 stores both the energy parameter and the K10 coefficient and alternately inputs the same into the appropriate location in K stack 302.KE10 transfer register 303 is either loaded with the K10 or energy parameter from E10 loop 304 or the appropriate K1 K9 speech coefficient from K stack 302 for interpolation by logics 307 311. As will be seen, recoding logic 301 preferably performs a Booth s algorithm on the data from K stack 302, before such data is applied to array multiplier 401. Recoding logic 301 thereby permits the size of the array multiplier 401 to be reduced compared to the array multiplier described in U.S. Patent Application S N 905,328.Filter and Excitation Generator The filter excitation generator 24 includes the array multiplier 401 whose output is connected to a summer multiplexer 402. The output of summer multiplexer 402 is coupled to the input of summer 404 whose output is coupled to a delay stack 406 and multiplier multiplexer 405. The output of the delay stack is applied as an input to summer multiplexer 402 and to Y latch 403. The output of Y latch 403 is coupled to an input of multiplier multiplexer 405 along with truncation logic 501. The output of multiplier multiplexer 405 is applied as an input to array multiplier 401. As will be seen filter and excitation generator 24 make use of the lattice filter described in U.S. Patent ApplicationS.N. 905,328. Various minor interconnections are not shown in FIGURE 4b for sake of clarity, but which will be described with reference to FIGURES 10a 10c, 11a ild. The arrangement of the foregoing elements generally agrees with the arrangement shown in FIGURE 7 of U.S. Patent ApplicationS.N. 905,328 thus array multiplier 401 corresponds to element 30 , summer multiplexer 402 corresponds to elements 37b , 37c and 37d , gates 414 FIGURES 11a and lib correspond to element 33 , delay stack 406 corresponds to elements 34 and 35 , Y latch 403 corresponds to element 36 and multiplier multiplexer 405 corresponds to elements 38a , 38b , 38c and 38d . The voice excitation data is supplied from unvoiced voice gate 408. As will be subsequently described in greater detail, the parameters inserted into parameter input gate 205 are supplied in a compressed data format. According to the data compression scheme used, when the coded pitch parameter is equal zero in input register 205, it is interpreted as an unvoiced condition by condition decoders and latches 208. Gate 408 responds by supplying randomized data from unvoiced generator 407 as the excitation input on line 414. When the coded pitch parameter is of some other value, however, it is decoded by parameter ROM 202, loaded into parameter output register 201 and eventually inserted into pitch register 305, either directly or by the interpolation scheme previously described.Based on the period indicated by the number in pitch register 305, voiced excitation is derived from chirp ROM 409. As discussed in U.S. PatentApplication S.N. 905,328 the voiced excitation signal may be an impulse function or some other repeating function such as a repeating chirp function. In this embodiment, a chirp has been selected as this tends to reduce the fuzziness from the speech generated because it apparently more closely models the action of the vocal cards than does a impulse function which chirp is repetitively generated by chirpROM 409. Chirp ROM 409 is addressed by counter latch 410, whose address is incremented in an add one circuit 411.The address in counter latch 410 continues to increment in add one circuit 411, recirculating via reset logic 412 until magnitude comparator 413, which compares the magnitude of the address being outputted from add one circuit 411 and the contents of the pitch register 305, indicates that the value in counter latch 410 then compares with or exceeds the value in pitch register 305, at which time reset logic 412 ze roes the address in counter 410. Beginning at address zero and extending through approximately fifty addresses is the chirp function in chirp ROM 409. Counter latch 410 and chirpROM 409 are set up so that addresses larger than fifty do not cause any portion of the chirp function to be outputted from chirp ROM 409 to UV gate 408. In this manner the chirp function is repetitively generated on a pitch related period during voiced speech. SYSTEM TIMING FIGURE 5 depicts the timing relationships between the occurrences of the various timing signals generated on synthesizer chip 10. Also depicted are the timing relationships with respect to the time new frames of data are inputted to synthesizer chip 10, the timing relationship with respect to the interpolations performed on the inputted parameters, the timing relations with respect to the foregoing with the time periods of the lattice filter and the relationship of all the foregoing to the basic clock signals. The synthesizer is preferably implemented using precharged, conditional discharge type logics and thereforeFIGURE 5 shows clocks f 4 which may be appropriately used with such precharge conditional discharge logic. There are two main clock phases 1 1 and z 2 and two precharge clock phases 3 and 4 . Phase 15 3 goes low during the first half of phase 1 and serves as a precharge therefor.Phase ç 4 goes low during the first half of phase 2 and serves as a precharge therefore. A set of clocks 1 154 required to clock one bit of data and thus correspond to one time period. The time periods are labeled T1 T20 and each preferably has a time period on the order of five microseconds.Selecting a time period on the order of five microseconds permits, as will be seen, data to be outputted from the digital filter at a ten kilohertz rate i.e., at a 100 micro second period which provides for a frequency response of five kilohertz in the D to A output section 25 FIGURE 4b .It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, that depending on the frequency response which is desired and depending upon the number of Kn speech coefficients used, and also depending upon the type of logics used, that the periods or frequencies of the clocks and clock phases shown in FIGURE 5 may be substantially altered, if desired. As is explained in U.S. Patent Application S.N.905,328, one cycle time of the lattice filter in filter excitation generator 24, preferably comprises twenty time periods, T1 T20. For reasons not important here, the numbering of these time periods differs between this application andU.S. Patent Application S.N. 905,328. To facilitate the reader s understanding of the differences in the numbering of the time periods, both numbering schemes are shown at the time period time line 500 in FIGURE 5. At time line 500, the time periods, T1 T20 which are not enclosed in parenthesis identify the time periods according to the convention used in this application. On the other hand, the time periods convention used in U.S. Patent Application S.N. 905,328. Thus, time period T17 is equivalent to time period T9 . At numeral 501 is depicted the parameter count PC timing signals. In this embodiment there are thirteen PC signals, PC 0 through PC 12. The first twelve of these, PC 0 through PC 11 correspond to times when the energy, pitch, and K1 K10 parameters, respectively, are available in parameter output register 201. Each of the first twelve PC s comprise two cycles, which are labeled A and B. Each such cycle starts at time period T17 and continues to the following T17.During each PC the target value from the parameter output register 201 is interpolated with the existing value in K stack 302 in parameter interpolator 23. During the A cycle, the parameter being interpolated is withdrawn from the K stack 302,E10 loop 304 or register 305, as appropriate, during an appropriate time period. During the B cycle the newly interpolated value is reinserted in the K stack or E10 loop or pitch register . The thirteenth PC, PC 12, is provided for timing purposes so that all twelve parameters are interpolated once each during a 2.5 milisecond interpolation period. As was discussed with respect to the parameter interpolator 23 of FIGURE 4b and Table VII, eight interpolations are performed for each inputting of a new frame of data from ROMs 12a b into synthesizer 10. This is seen at numeral 502 of FIGURE 5 where timing signals DIV 1, DIV 2,DIV 4 and DIV 8 are shown. These timing signals occur during specific interpolation counts IC as shown. There are eight such interpolation counts, IC0 IC7. New data is inputted from the ROMs 12a b into the synthesizer during ICO. These new target values of the parameters are then used during the next eight interpolation counts, IC1 through ICO the existing parametersiin the pitch register 305 K stack 302 and E10 loop 304 are interpolated once during each interpolation count.At the last interpolation count, IC0, the present value of the parameters in the pitch register 305, K stack 302 andE10 loop 304 finally attain the target values previously inputted toward the last IC0 and thus new target values may then again be inputted as a new frame of data. Inasmuch as each interpolation count has a period of 2.5 milliseconds, the period at which new data frames are inputted to the synthesizer chip is 20 microseconds or equivalent to a frequency of 50 hertz. The DIV 8 signal corresponds to those interpolation counts in which one eighth of the difference produced by subtractor 308 is added to the present values in adder 310 whereas during DIV 4 one fourth of the difference is added in, and so on. Thus, during DIV 2, 1 2 of the difference from subtractor 308 is added to the present value of the parameter in adder 310 and lastly during DIV 1 the total difference is added in adder 310. As has been previously mentioned, the effect of this interpolation scheme can be seen in Table VII. PARAMETER DATA COMPRESSION It has been previously mentioned that new parameters are inputted to the speech synthesizer at a 50 hertz rate. It will be subsequently seen that in parameter interpolator and excitation generator 24 FIGURE 4b the pitch data, energy data and K1 Kn parameters are stored and utilized as ten bit digital binary numbers. If each of these twelve parameters were updated with a ten bit binary number at a fifty hertz rate from an external source, such as ROMs 12a and 12b, this would require a 12x10x50 or 6,000 hertz bit rate. Using the data compression techniques which will be explained, reduce this bit rate required for synthesizer 10 to on the order of 1,000 to 1,200 bits per second.And more importantly, it has been found that the speech compression schemes herein disclosed do not appreciably degrade the quality of speech generated thereby in comparison to using the data uncompressed. The data compression scheme used is pictorially shown in FIGURE 6. Referring now to FIGURE 6, it can be seen that there is pictorially shown four different lengths of frames of data. One, labeled voiced frame, has a length of 49 bits while another entitled unvoiced frame, has a length of 28 bits while still another called repeat frame has a length of ten bits and still another which may be alternatively called zero energy frame or energy 15 frame has the length of but four bits. The voiced frame supplies four bits of data for a coded energy parameter as well as coded four bits for each of five speech parameters K3 through K7.Five bits of data are reserved for each of three coded parameters, pitch, K1 and K2. Additionally, three bits of data are provided for each of three coded speech parameters K8 toK10 and finally another bit is reserved for a repeat bit. In lieu of inputting ten bits of binary data for each of the parameters, a coded parameter is inputted which is converted to a ten bit parameter by addressing parameterROM 202 with the coded parameter. Thus, coefficient K1, for example, may have any one of thirty two different values, according to the five bit code for K1, each one of the thirty two values being a ten bit numerical coefficient stored in parameter ROM 202. Thus, the actual values of coefficients K1 and K2 may have one of thirty two different values while the actual values of coefficients K3 through K7 may be one of sixteen different values and the values of coefficients K8 through K9 may be one of eight different values. The coded pitch parameter is five bits long and therefore may have up to thirty two different values.However, only thirty one of these reflect actual pitch values, a pitch code of 00000 being used to signify an unvoiced frame of data. The coded energy parameter is four bits long and therefore would normally have sixteen available ten bit values however, a coded energy parameter equal to 0000 indicates a silent frame such as occur as pauses in and between words, sentences and the like. A coded energy parameter equal to 1111 energy equals fifteen , on the other hand, is used to signify the end of a segment of spoken speech, thereby indicating that the synthesizer is to stop speaking. Thus, of the sixteen codes available for the coded energy parameter, fourteen are used to signify different ten bit speech energy levels. Coded coefficients K1 and K2 have more bits than coded coefficients K3 K7 which in turn have more bits than coded coefficients K8 through K10 because coefficient K1 has a greater effect on speech than K2 which has a greater effect on speech than K3 and so forth through the lower order coefficients. Thus given the greater significance of coefficients K1 and K2 than coefficients K8 through K10, for example, more bits are used in coded format to define coefficients K1 and K2 than K3 K7 or K8 K10. Also it has been found that voiced speech data needs more coefficients to correctly model speech than does unvoiced speech and therefore when unvoiced frames are encountered, coefficients K5 through K10 are not updated, but rather are merely zeroed. The synthesizer realizes when an unvoiced frame is being outputted because the uncoded pitch parameter is equal to 00000. It has also been found that during speech there often occur instances wherein the parameters do not significantly change during a twenty milisecond period particularly, the K1 K10 coefficients will often remain nearly unchanged. Thus, a repeat frame is used wherein newenergy and new pitch are inputted to the synthesizer, however, the K1 to K10 coefficients previously inputted remain unchanged.The synthesizer recognizes the ten bit repeat frame because the repeat bit between energy and pitch then comes up whereas it is normally off. As previously mentioned, there occur pauses between speech or at the end of speech which are preferably indicated to the synthesizer such pauses are indicated by a coded energy frame equal to zero, at which time the synthesizer recognizes that only four bits are to be sampled for that frame. Similarly, only four bits are sampled when an energy equals fifteen. Using coded values for the speech in lieu of actual values, alone would reduce the data rate to 48x50 or 2400 bits per second. By additionally using variable frame lengths, as shown inFIGURE 6, the data rate maybe further reduced to on the order of one thousand to twelve hundred bits per second, depending on the speaker and on the material spoken. The effect of this data compression scheme can be seen from Table VIII where the coding for the word HELP is shown. Each line represents a new frame of data. As can be seen, the first part of the word HELP , HEL , is mainly voiced while the P is unvoiced. Also note the pause.between HEL and P and the advantages of using the repeat bit. Table IX sets forth the encoded and decoded speech parameter. The 3, 4 or 5 bit code appears as a hexadecimal number in the left hand column, while the various decoded parameter values are shown as ten bit, two s complement numbers expressed as hexadecimal numbers in tabular form under the various parameters. The decoded speech parameter are stored in ROM 203.The repeat bit is shown in Table VIII between the pitch and K parameters for sake of clarity preferably, according to the embodiment of FIGURE 6, the repeat bit occurs just before the most significant bit MSB of the pitch parameter. SYNTHESIZER LOGIC DIAGRAMS The various portions of the speech synthesizer ofFIGURES 4a and 4b will now be described with reference toFIGURES 7a through 14b which, depict, in detail, the logic circuits implemented on a semiconductor chip, for example, to form the synthesizer 10. The following discussion, with reference to the aforementioned drawings, refers to logic signals available at many points in the circuit. It is to be remembered that in P channel MOS devices a logical zero corresponds to a negative voltage, that is Vdd, while a logical one refers to a zero voltage, that is, Vss. It should be further remembered that P channel MOS transistors depicted in the aforementioned figures are conductive when a logical zero, that is, a negative voltage, is applied at their respective gates. When a logic signal is referred to which is unbarred, that is, has no bar across the top of it, the logic signal is to be interpreted as TRUE logic that is, a binary one indicates the presence of the signal Vss whereas a binary zero indicates the lack of the signal Vdd . Logic signal names including a bar across the top thereof are FALSE logic that is, a binary zero Vdd voltage indicates the presence of the signal whereas a binary one Vss voltage indicates that the signal is not present. It should also be understood that a numeral three in clocked gates indicates that phase 3 is used as a precharge whereas a four in a clocked gate indicates that phase cb 4 is used as a precharge clock. An S in the gate indicates that the gate is statically operated. Timing Logic Diagram Referring now to FIGURES 7a 7d, they form a composite detailed logic diagram of the timing logic for synthesizer 10. Counter 510 is a pseudorandom shift counter including a shift register 510a and feed back logic SlOb. The counter 510 counts into pseudorandom fashion and theTRUE and FALSE outputs from shift register 510a are supplied to the input section 511 of a timing PLA. The various T time periods decoded by the timing PLA are indicated adjacent to the output lines thereof. Section 511c of the timingPLA is applied to an output timing PLA 512 generating various combinations and sequences of time period signals, such as T odd, T10 T18 and so forth. Sections 511a and 511b of timing PLA 511 will be described subsequently. The parameter count in which the synthesizer is operating is maintained by a parameter counter 513. Parameter counter 513 includes an add one circuit and circuits which are responsive to SLOW and SLOW D. In SLOW, the parameter counter repeats the A cycle of the parameter count twice for a total of three A cycles before entering theB cycle. That is, the period of the parameter count doubles so that the parameters applied to the lattice filter are updated and interpolated at half the normal rate. To assure that the inputted parametersare interpolated only once during each parameter count during SLOW speaking operations each parameter count comprises three A cycles followed by one B cycle.It should be recalled that during the A cycle the interpolation is begun and during the B cycle the interpolated results are reinserted back into either K stack 302, E10 loop 304 or pitch register 305, as appropriate.Thus, merely repeating the A cycle has no affect other than to recalculate the same value of a speech parameter but since it is only reinserted once back into either K stack 302, E10 loop 304 or pitch register 305 only the results of the interpolation. immediately before the B cycle are retained. Inasmuch as parameter counter 513 includes an add one circuit, the results outputted therefrom, PC1 PC4, represent in binary form, the particular parameter count in which the synthesizer is operating. Output PC0 indicates in which cycle, A or B, the parameter count is. The parameter counter outputs PC1 PC4 are decoded by timing PLA 514. The particular decimal value of the parameter count is decoded by timing PLA 514 which is shown in adjacent to the timing PLA 514 with nomenclature such as PC 0, PC 1, PC 7 and so forth. The relationship between the particular parameters and the value of PC is set forth in FIGURE 6.Output portions 511a and 511b of timing PLA 511 are also interconnected with outputs from timing PLA 514 whereby the Transfer K TK signal goes high during T9 of PC 2 orT8 of PC 3 or T7 of PC 4 and so forth through T1 of PC 10.Similarly, a LOAD Parameter LDP timing signal goes high during T5 of PC 0 or T1 of PC 1 or T3 of PC 2 and so forth through T7 of PC 11. As will be seen, signal TK is used in controlling the transfer of data from parameter output register 201 to subtractor 308, which transfer occurs at different T times according to the particular parameter count the parameter counter 513 is in to assure that the appropriate parameter is being outputted from KE10 transfer register 303. Signal LDP is, as will be seen, used in combination with the parameter input register to control the number of bits which are inputted therein according to the number of bits associated with the parameter then being loaded according to the number of bits in each coded parameter as defined in FIGURE 6. Interpolation counter 515 includes a shift register and an add one circuit for binary counting the particular interpolation cycle in which the synthesizer 10 is operating. The relationship between the particular interpolation count in which the synthesizer is operating and the DIV1, DIV2, DIV4 and DIV8 timing signals derived therefrom is explained in detail with reference to FIGURE 6 and therefore additional discussion here would be superfluous. It will be noted, however, that interpolation counter 515 includes a three bit latch 516 which is loaded at TI. The output of three bit latch 516 is decoded by gates 517 for producing the aforementioned DIV1 through DIV8 timing sig nals. Interpolation counter 515 is responsive to a signalRESETF from parameter counter 513 for permitting interpolation counter 515 to increment only after PC 12 has occurred.ROM Controller Interface Logic Diagram Turning now to FIGURES 8a, and 8b 8f, which form a composite diagram, there is shown a detailed logic diagram of ROM Controller interface logic 21. Parameter input register 205 is coupled, at its input to address pin ADD8.Register 205 is a six bit shift register, most of the stages of which are two bits long. The stages are two bits long in this embodiment inasmuch as ROMs 12a and b output, as will be seen, data at half the rate at which data is normally clocked in synthesizer 10. At the input of parameter input register 205 is a parameter input control gate 220 which is responsive to the state of a latch 221. Latch 221 is set in response to LDP, PC0 and DIV1 all being a logical one. It is reset at T14 and in response to parameter load enable from gate 238 being a logical zero. Thus, latch 221 permits gate 220 to load data only during the A portion as controlled by PC0 of the appropriate parameter count and at an appropriate T time as controlled by LDP of ICO as controlled by DIV1 provided parameter load enable is at a logical one. Latch 221 is reset by T14 after the data has been inputted into parameter register 205. The coded data in parameter input register 205 is applied on lines IN0 IN4 to coded parameter RAM 203, which is addressed by PC1 PC4 to indicate which coded parameter is then being stored. The contents of register 205 is tested by all one s gate 207, all zeroes gate 206 and repeat latch 208a. As can be seen, gate 206 tests for all zeroes in the four least significant bits of register 205 whereas gate 207 tests for all ones in those bits. Gate 207 is also responsive to PC0, DIV1, T16 and PC 0 so that the zero condition is only tested during the time that the coded energy parameter is being loaded into parameter ROM 205. The repeat bit occurs in this embodiment immediately in front of the coded pitch parameter therefore, it is tested during the A cycle of PC 1.Pitch latch 208b is set in response to all zeroes in the coded pitch parameter and is therefore responsive to not only gate 206 but also the most significant bit of the pitch data on line 222 as well as PC 1. Pitch latch 208b is set whenever the loaded coded pitch parameter is a 00000 indicating that the speech is to be unvoiced. Energy 0 latch 208c is responsive to the output of gate 206 and PC 0 for testing whether all zeroes have been inputted as the coded energy parameter and is set in response thereto. Old pitch latch 208d stores the output of the pitch 0 latch 208b from the prior frame of speech data while old energy latch 208e stores the output of energy 0 latch 208c from the prior frame of speech data. The contents of old pitch latch 208d and pitch 0 latch 208b are compared in comparison gates 223 for the purpose of generating an INHIBIT signal. As will be seen, the INHIBIT signal inhibits interpolations and this is desirable during changes from voiced to unvoiced or unvoiced to voiced speech so that the new speech parameters are automatically inserted into K stack 302, E10 loop 304 and pitch register 305 as opposed to being more slowly interpolated into those memory elements.Also, the contents of old energy latch 208e and energy 0 latch 208c is tested by NAND gate 224 for inhibiting interpolation for a transition from a nonspeaking frame to a speaking frames of data. The outputs of NAND gate 224 and gates 223 are coupled to a NAND gate 235 whose output is inverted to INHIBITI by an inverter 236. Latches 208a 208c are reset by gate 225 and latches 208d and 208e are reset by gate 226. When the excitation signal is unvoiced, the K5 K10 coefficients are set to ze ro, as aforementioned. This is accomplished, in part, by the action of gate 237 which generates a ZPAR signal when pitch is equal to zero and when the parameter counter is greater than five, as indicated by PC 5 from PLA 514. Also shown in FIGURES 8a f is a command latch 210 which comprises three latches 210a,b, and c which latch in the data at CTL2,4 and 8 in response to a processor data clock PDC signal in conjunction with a chip select CS signal. The contents of command latch 210 is decoded by command decoder 211 unless disabled by latches 218a and 218b. As previously mentioned, these latches are responsive to decoded LA, output and TTALK commands for disabling decoder 211 from decoding what everxdata happens to be on the CTL2 CTL8 pins when subsequent PDC signals are received in conjunction with the LA, output and TTALK commands. A decoded TTALK command set TTALK latch 219. The output of TTALK latch 219, which is reset by a ProcessorData Clock Leading Edge PDCLE signal or by an output from latch. 218b, controls along with the output of latch 218a NOR gates 227a and b.The output of NOR gate 227a is a logical one if TTALK latch 219 is set, thereby coupling pins CTL1 to the talk latch via tristate buffer 228 and inverters 229. Tristate latch 228 is shown in detail on the right side of FIGURES 8a f. NOR gate 227b, on the other hand, outputs a logical one if an output code has been detected, setting latch 228a and thereby connecting pins CTL1 to the most significant bit of data input register 212. Data is shifted into data input register 212 from address pin 8 in response to a decoded read command by logics 230. RE, RB and LA instructions are outputted toROM via instruction pins Io I1 from ROM control logic 217 via buffers 214c. The contents of data input register 212 is outputted to CTL1 CTL4 pins via buffers 213 and to the aforementioned CTL1 pin via buffer 228 when NOR gate 227b inputs a logical one. CTL1 CTL4 pins are connected to address pins ADD1 ADD4 via buffers 214a and CTL8 pin is connected to ADD8 pin 8 via a control buffer 214b which is disabled when addresses are being loaded on the ADD1 ADD8 pins by the signal on line 231. The Talk latch 216 shown in FIGURES 8a f preferably comprises three latches 216a, 216b and 216c. Latch 216a is set in response to a decoded SPK command and generates, in response thereto, a speak enable SPEN signal.As will be seen, SPEN is also generated in response to a decoded SPKSLOW command by latch 215a. Latch 216b is set in response to speak enable during IC7 as controlled by gate 225. Latches 216a and 216b are reset in response to 1 a decoded reset command, 2 an energy equals fifteen code or 3 on a power up clear by gate 232. Talk delayed latch 216c is set with the contents of latch 216b at the followingIC7 and retains that data through eight interpolation counts. As was previously mentioned, the talk delayed latch permits the speech synthesizer to continue producing speech data for eight interpolation cycles after a coded energy 0 condition has been detected setting latch 208c.Likewise, slow talk latch 215 is implemented with latches 215a, 215b and 215c. Latch 215a enables the speak enable signal while latches 215b and 215c enable the production of the SLOWD signal in much the same manner as latches 216b 21d 216c enable the production of the TALKD signal. Considering now, briefly, the timing interactions for inputting data into parameter input register 205, it will be recalled that this is controlled chiefly by a control gate 220 in response to the state of a parameter input latch 221. Of course, the state of the latch is controlled by the LDP signal applied to gate 233. The PC0 and DIV1 signals applied to gate 233 to assure that the parameters are loaded during the A cycle of a particular parameter count during IC0. The particular parameter and the parameter T Time within the parameter count is controlled by LDP according to the portion 511a of timing PLA 511 FIGURES 7a 7d . The first parameter inputted Energy is four bits long and therefore LDP is initiated during time period T5 as can be seen in FIGURES 7a 7d .During parameter count 1, the repeat bit and pitch bits are inputted, this being six bits which are inputted according to LDP which comes up at time period T1. Of course, there four times periods difference between T1 and T5 but only two bits difference in the length of the inputted information. This occurs because it takes two time periods to input each bit into parameter input register 205 which has two stages per each inputted bit due to the fact that ROMs 12a 12b are preferably clocked at half the rate at that which synthesizer 10 is clocked. By clocking the ROM chips at half the rate, that the synthesizer 10 chip is clocked simplifies the addressing of the read only memories in the aforesaid ROM chips and yet, as can be seen, data is supplied to the synthesizer 10 in plenty of time for performing numerical operations thereon. Thus, in section 511a of timing PLA 511, LDP comes up at T1 when the corresponding parameter count indicates that a six bit parameter is to be inputted, comes up at T3 when the corresponding parameter count indicates that a five bit parameter is to be inputted, comes up at T5 when the corresponding parameter count indicates that a four bit parameter is to be inputted and comes up at time period T7 when the corresponding parameter count EG parameter counts 9, 10 and 11 which correspond to a three bit coded parameter. ROMs 12a b are signaled that the addressed parameter ROM is to output information when signaled via Io instruction pin, ROM control logic 217 and line 234 which provides information to ROM control logic 217 from latch 221. Parameter Interpolator Logie Diagram Referring now to FIGURES 9a 9d, which form a composite diagram the parameter interpolator logic 23 is shown in detail. K stack 203 comprises ten registers each of which store ten bits of information. Each small square represents one bit of storage, according to the convention depicted at numeral 330. The contents of each shift register is arranged to recirculate via recirculation gates 314 under control of a recirculation control gate 315.K stack 302 stores speech coefficients K1 K9 and temporarily stores coefficient K10 or the energy parameter generally in accordance with the speech synthesis apparatus of FIGURE 7 of U.S. Patent Application S.N. 905,328. The data outputted from K stack 302 to recoding logic 30 at various time periods is shown in Table VII. In Table III of U.S.Patent Application S.N. 905,328 is shown the data outputted from the K stack of FIGURE 7 thereof. Table X of this patent differs from Table III of the aforementioned patent because of 1 recoding logic 301 receives the same coefficient on lines 32 1 through 32 4, on lines 32 5 and 32 6, on lines 32 7 and 32 8 and on lines 32 9 and 32 10 because, as will be seen, recoding logic 301 responds to two bits of information for each bit which was responded to by the array multiplier of the aforementioned U.S. Patent 2 because of the difference in time period nomenclature as was previously explained with reference to FIGURE 5 and 3 because of the time delay associated with the recoding logic 301. Recoding logic 301 couples K stack 302 to array multiplier 401 FIGURES 10a 10c . Recoding logic 301 includes four identical recoding stages 312a 312d, only one of which, 312a, is shown in detail. The first stage of the recoding logic, 313, differs from stages 312a 312d basically because there is, of course, no carry, such as occurs on input A in stages 312a 312d, from a lower order stage. Recoding logic outputs 2, 2, 1 and 1 to each stage of a five stage array multiplier 401, except for stage zero which receives only 2, 71 and 1 outputs.Effectively recoding logic 301 permits array multiplier to process, in stage thereof, two bits in lieu of one bit of information, using Booth s algorithm. Booth s algorithm is explained in Theory and Application of Digital SignalProcessing , published by Prentice Hall 1975, at pp. 517 18. The K10 coefficient and energy are stored in E10 loop 304. E10 loop preferably comprises a twenty stage serial shift register ten stages 304a of E10 loop 304 are preferably coupled in series and another ten stages 304b which are also coupled in series but also have parallel outputs and inputs to K stack 302. The appropriate parameter, either energy of the K10 coefficient, is transferred from E10 loop 304 to K stack 302 via gates 315 which are responsive to a NOR gate 316 for transferring the energy parameter from E10 loop 304 to K stack 302 at time period T10 and transferring coefficient K1O from E10 loop 304 to K stack 302 at time period T20. NOR gate 306 also controls recirculation control gate 315 for inhibiting recirculation in K stack 302 when data is being transferred. KE10 transfer register 303 facilitates the transferring of energy or the K1 K10 speech coefficients which are stored in Elo loop 304 or K stack 302 to adder 308 and delay circuit 309 via selector 307. Register 303 has nine stages provided by paired inverters and a tenth stage being effectively provided by selector 307 and gate 317 for facilitating the transfer of ten bits of information either from E10 loop 304 or K stack 302. Data is transferred fromK stack 302 to register 303 via transfer gates 318 which are controlled by a Transfer K TK signal generated by decoder portion 511b of timing PLA 511 FIGURES 7a 7d .Since the particular parameter to be interpolated and thus shifted into register 303 depends upon the particular parameter count in which the synthesizer is operating and since the particular parameter available to be outputted from K stack 302 is a function of particular time period the synthesizer is operating in, the TK signal comes up atT9 for the pitch parameter, T8 for the K1 parameter, T7 for the K2 parameter and so forth, as is shown in FIGURES 7a 7d. The energy parameter or the K10 coefficient is clocked out of E10 loop 304 into register 303 via gates 319 in response to a TE10 signal generated by a timing PLA 511.After each interpolation, that is during the B cycle, data is transferred from register 303 into 1 K stack 302 via gates 318 under control of signal TK, at which time recirculation gates 314 are turned off by gate 315, or 2 E10 loop 304 via gates 319. A ten bit pitch parameter is stored in a pitch register 305 which includes a nine stage shift register as well as recirculation elements 305a whieh provide another bit of storage. The pitch parameter normally recirculates in register 305 via gate 305a except when a newly interpolated pitch parameter is being provided on line 320, as controlled by pitch interpolation control logic 306. The output of pitch 305 PTO or the output from register 303 is applied by selector 307 to gate 317. Selector 307 is also controlled by logics 306 for normally coupling the output of register 303 to ga te 317 except when the pitch is to be interpolated.Logics 306 are responsive for outputting pitch to adder 308 and delay 309 during the A cycle of PC 1 and for returning the interpolated pitch value on line 320 on theB cycle of PC 1 to register 305. Gate 317 is responsive to a latch 321 for only providing pitch, energy or coefficient information to adder 308 and delay circuit 309 during the interpolation. Since the data is serially clocked, the information may be started to be clocked during an A portion and PCO may switch to a logical one sometime during the transferring of the information from register 303 or 305 to adder 308 or delay circuit 309, and therefore, gate 317 is controlled by an A cycle latch 321, which latch is set with PCO at the time a transfer coefficient TK transfer E10 TE10 or transfer pitch TP signal is generated by timing PLA 511. The output of gate 3 17 is applied to adder 308 and delay circuit 309. The delay in delay circuit 309 depends on the state of DIV1 DIV8 signals generated by interpolation counter 515 FIGURES 7 7d . Since the data exits gate 317 least significant bit first, by delaying the data in delay circuit 309 a selective amount, and applying the output to adder 310 along with the output of subtractor 308, the more delay there is in circuit 309, the smaller the effective magnitude of the difference from subtractor 308 which is subsequently added back in by adder 310.Delay circuit 311 couples adder 310 back into register 303 and 305. Both delay circuits 309 and 303 can insert up to three bits of delay and when adder 309 is at its maximum delay 311 is at its minimum delay and vice versa.A NAND gate 322 couples the output of subtractor 308 to the input of adder 310. Gate 322 is responsive to the output of an OR gate 323 which is in turn responsive to INHIBIT from inverted 236 FIGURES 8a f . Gates 322 and 323 act to zero the output from subtractor 308 when the INHIBIT signal comes up unless the interpolation counter is at ICO in which case the present values inK stack 302, E10 loop 304 and P register 305 are fully interpolated to their new target values in a one step interpolation. When an unvoiced frame FIGURE 6 is supplied to the speech synthesis chip, coefficientsK5 K10 are set to zero by the action of gate 324 which couples delay circuit 311 to shift register 325 whose output is then coupled to gates 305a and 303 . Gate 324 is responsive to the zero parameter ZPAR signal generated by gate 237 FIGURES 8a f . Gate 326 disable shifting in the 304b portion of E10 loop 304 when a newly interpolated value of energy or K10 is being inputted into portion 304b from register 303. Gate 327 controls the transfer gates coupling the stages of register 303, which stages are inhibited from serially shifting data therebetween when TK or TE10 goes high during the A cycle, that is, when register 303 is to be receiving data from either K stack 302 or E10 loop 304 as controlled by transfer gates 318 or 319, respectively.The output of gates 327 is also connected to various stages of shift register 325 and to a gate coupling 303 with register 303. Whereby up top the three bits which may trail the ten most significant bits after an interpolation operation may be zeroed. Array Multiplier Logic Diagram Figures 10a and lOb form a composite logic diagram of array multiplier 401. Array multipliers are sometimes referred to as Pipeline Multipliers. For example, see Pipeline Multiplier by Granville E.Ott, published by the University of Missouri. Array multiplier 401 has five stages, stage 0 through stage 4, and a delay stage. The delay stage is used in array multiplier 41 to give it the same equivalent delay as the array multiplier shown in U.S.Patent Application S.N. 905,328. The input to array multiplier 401 is provided by signals Mr0 R13,from multiplier multiplexer 405. MR13 is the most significant bit while MR is the least significant bit. Another input to array multiplier are the aforementioned 2, 2, 1 and 1 outputs from recoding logic 301 FIGURES 8a f . The output from array multiplier 401, P13 P0, is applied to summer multiplexer 402. The least signifcant bit thereof, PO, is in this embodiment always made a logical one because doing so establishes the mean of the truncation error as zero instead of 1 2 LSB which value would result from a simple truncation of a two s complement number. Array multiplier 401 is shown by a plurality of box elements labeled A 1, A 2, B l, B 2, B 3 or B C. The specific logic elements making up these box elements are shown on the right hand side of composite FIGURES 10a 10b in lieu of repetitively showing these elements and making up a logic diagram of FIGURE 401, for simplicity sake. TheA 1 and A 2 block elements make up stage zero of the array multiplier and thus are each responsive to the 2, 71 and 1 signals outputted from decoder 313 and are further responsive to MR2 MR13. When multiplies occur in array multiplier 401, the most significant bit is always maintained in the left most column elements while the partial sums are continuously shifted toward the right.Inasmuch as each stage of array multiplier 401 operates on two binary bits, the partial sums, labeled En, are shifted to the right two places. Thus no A type blocks are provided for the MRO and MR1 data inputs to the first stage. Also, since each block in array multiplier 401 is responsive to two bits of information from K stack 302 received via recoding logic 301, each block is also responsive to two bits from multiplier multiplexer 405, which bits are inverted by inverters 430, which bits are also supplied in true logic to the B type blocks.Filter and Excitation Generator Logic Diagram FIGURES 11a 11b form a composite, detailed logic diagram of lattice filter and excitation generator 24 other than array multiplier 401 and output section 25. In filter and excitation generator 24 is a summer 404 which is connected to receive at one input thereof either the true or inverted output of array multiplier 401 see FIGURES 10a 10c on lines PO P13 via summer multiplexer 402. The other input of adder 404 is connected via summer multiplexer 402 to receive either the output of adder 404 at T10 T18 , the output of delay stack 406 on lines 440 453 at T20 T7 and T9 , the output of Y latch 403 at T8 or a logical zero from 63 precharge gate 420 at T19 when no conditional discharge is applied to this input .The reasons these signals are applied at these times can be seen from FIGURE 8 of the aforementioned U.S. Patent Application S N 905,328 it is to be remembered of course, that the time period designation differs as discussed with reference to FIGURE 5 hereof. The output of adder 404 is applied to delay stack 406, multiplier multiplexer 405, one period delay gates 414 and summer multiplexer 402. Multiplier multiplexer 405 includes a one period delay gates 414 which are generally equivalent to one period delay 341 ofFIGURE 7 in U.S. Patent Application S.N. 905,328. Y latch 403 is connected to receive the output of delay stack 406. Multiplier multiplexer 405 selectively applies the output from Y latch 403, one period delay gates 414, or the excitation signal on bus 415 to the input MRO MR13 of array multiplier 401. The inputs DO D13 to delay stack 406 are derived from the outputs of adders 404. The logics for summer multiplier 402, adder 404, Y latch 403, multiplier multiplexer 405 and one period delay circuit 414 are only shown in detail for the least significant bit as enclosed by dotted line reference A.The thirteen most significant bits in the lattice filter also are provided by logics such as those enclosed by the reference A line, which logics are denoted by long rectangular phantom line boxes labeld A . The logics for each parallel bit being processed in the lattice filter are not shown in detail for sake of clarity. The portions of the lattice filter handling bits more significant than the least significant bit differ from the logic shown for elements 402, 403, 404, 405, and 414 only with respect to the interconnections made with truncation logics 5O1 and bus 415 which connects to UV gate 408 and chirp ROM 409. In this respect, the output from W gate 408 and chirp ROM 409 is only applied to inputs I13 I6 and therefore the input labeled 1x within the reference A phantom line is not needed for the six least significant bits in the lattice filter. Similarly, the output from the Y latch 403 is only applied for the ten most significant bits,YL13 through YL4, and therefore the connection labeledYLx within the reference line is not required for the four least significant bits in the lattice filter. Delay stack 406 comprises 14 nine bit long shift registers, each stage of which comprises inverters clocked on m4 and m3 clocks. As is discussed in U.S.Patent Application S.N. 905,328, the delay stack 406 which generally corresponds to shift register 35 ofFIGURE 7 of the aforementioned patent, is only shifted on certain time periods. This is accomplished by logics 416 whereby M1B b4B clocks are generated from T10 T18 timing signal from PLA 512 FIGURES 7a and 7b . The clock buffers 417 in circuit 416 are also shown in detail inFIGURES 11a and 11b. Delay stack 406 is nine bits long whereas shift register 35 in FIGURE 7 of U.S. Patent Application S.N.905,328 was eight bits long this difference occurs because the input to delay stack 406 is shown as being connected from the output of adder 404 as opposed to the output of one period delay circuit 414. Of course, the input to delay stack 406 could be connected from the outputs of one period delay circuit 414 and the timing associated therewith modified to correspond with that shown in U.S.Patent Application S.N. 905,328. The data handled in delay stack 406, array multiplier 401, adder 402, summer multiplexer 402, Y latch 403, and multiplier multiplexer 405 is preferably handled in two s complement notation. Unvoiced generator 407 is a random noise generator comprising a shift register 418 with a feedback term supplied by feedback logics 419 for generating pseudorandom terms in shift register 418. An output is taken therefrom and is applied to UV gate 408 which is also responsive toOLDP from latch 208d FIGURES 8a 8f . Old pitch latch 208d controls gate 408 because pitch O latch 208b changes state immediately when the new speech parameters are inputted to register 205.However, since this occurs during interpolation count ICO and since, during an unvoiced condition the new values are not interpolated into K stack 302, E10 loop 304 and pitch register 305 until the following ICO, the speech excitation value cannot change from a periodic excitation from chirpROM 409 to a random excitation from unvoiced generator 407 until eight interpolation cycles have occurred.Gate 420 nors the output of gate 408 into the most significant bit of the excitation signal, 113, thereby effectively causing the sign bit to randomly change during unvoiced speech. Gate 421 effectively forces the most significant bit of the excitation signal, 112, to a logical one during unvoiced speech conditions. Thus the combined effect of gates 408, 420 and 421 is to cause a randomly changing sign to be associated with a steady decimal equivalent value of .5 to be applied to the lattice filter and Filtering Excitation Generator 24. During voiced speech, chirp ROM 409 provides an eight bit output on lines I6 113 to the lattice filter.This output comprises forty one successively changing values which, when graphed, represent a chirp function.The contents of ROM 409 are listed in Table XI ROM 404 is set up to invert its outputs and thus the data is stored therein in complemented format. The chirp function value and the complemented value stored in the chirpROM are expressed in two s complement hexadecimal notation.ROM 409 is addressed by an eight bit register 410 whose contents are normally updated during each cycle through the lattice filter by add one circuit 411. The output of register 410 is compared with the contents of pitch register 305 in a magnitude comparator 403 for zeroing the contents of 410 when the contents of register 410 become equal to or greater than the contents of register 305.ROM 409, which is shown in greater detail in FIGURES 14a14b, is arranged so that addresses greater than 110010 cause all zeroes to be outputted on lines I13 Ig to multiplier multiplexer 405. Zerocs are also stored in address locations 41 51. Thus, the chirp may be expanded to occupy up to address location fifty, if desired.Random Access Memory Logic Diagram Referring now to FIGURES 12a 12b, there is shown a composite detailed logic diagram of RAM 203. RAM 203 is addressed by address on PC1 PC4, which address is decoded in a PLA 203a and defines which coded parameter is is to be inputted into RAM 203. RAM 203 stores the twelve decoded parameters, the parameters having bit lengths varying between three bits and five bits according to the decoding scheme described with reference to FIGURE 6.Each cell, reference B, of RAM 203 is shown in greater detail in FIGURE 12b. Read Write control logic 203b is responsive to T1, DIV1, PCO and parameter load enable for writing into the RAM 203 during the A cycle of each parameter count during interpolation count zero when enabled by parameter load enable from logics 238 FIGURE 8a f . Data is inputted to RAM 203 on lines INO IN4 from register 205 as shown in FIGURES 8a 8 f and data is outputted on lines OUT1 OUT5 to ROM 202 as is shown in the aforementioned figures.Parameter Read Only Memory Logic Diagram In FIGURES 13a 13c, there is shown a logic diagram of ROM 202. ROM 202 is preferably a virtual ground ROM of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,934,233.Address information from RAM 202 and from parameter counter 513 are applied to address buffers 202b which are shown in detail at reference A. The NOR gates 202a used in address buffers 202b are shown in detail at reference B. The outputs of the address buffers 202b are applied to an X decoder 202c or to a Y decoder 202d. The ROM is divided into ten sections labeled reference C, one of which is shown in greater detail. The outline for output line from each of the sections is applied to register 201 via inverters as shown in FIGURES 8a 8f. X decoder selects one of fifty four X decode lines while Y decoder 202d tests for the presence or nonpresence of a transistor cell between an adjacent pair of diffusion lines, as is explained in greater detail in the aforementioned U.S. Patent 3,934,233.The data preferably stored in ROM 202 of this embodiment is listed in Table IX. Chirp Read Only Memory Logic Diagram FIGURES 14a 14b form a composite diagram of chirp ROM 409. ROM 409 is addressed via address lines 7 7 0 8 from register 410 FIGURES 11a 11b and output information on lines Ig Ill to multiplier multiplexer 405 and lines Iml and 1m2 to gates 421 and 420, all which are shown inFIGURES 11a and 11b. As was previously discussed with reference to FIGURES 11a and 11b, chirp ROM outputs all zeroes after a predetermined count is reached in register 410, which, in this case is the count equivalent to a decimal 51. ROM 409 includes a Y decoder 409a which is responsive to the address on lines Ao and A1 and Ao and A1 in an X decoder 409b which is responsive to the address on lines A2 through A5 and A2 A5 . ROM 409 also includes a latch 409c which is set when decimal 51 is detected on lines AREA5 according to line 409c from a decoder 409e. Decoder 409e also decodes a logical zero on lines Ao A8 for resetting latch 409c.ROM 409 includes timing logics 409f which permit data to be clocked in via gates 409g at time period T12. At this time decoder 409e checks to determine whether either a decimal 0 or decimal 51 is occurring on address lines Ao A8. If either condition occurs, latch 409c, which is a static latch, is caused to flip. An address latch 409h is set at time periodT13 and reset at time period T11. Latch 409h permits latch 409c to force a decimal 51 onto lines AÏ A5 when latch 409c is set. Thus, for addresses greater than 51 address register 410, the address is first sampled at time period T12 to determine whether it has been reset to zero by reset logic 412 FIGURES 12a 12b for the purpose of resetting latch 409e and if the address has not been reset to zero then whatever address has been inputted on linesA0 A8 is written over by logics 409j at T13. Of course, at location 51 in ROM 409 will be stored all zeroes on the output lines I6 I11, IMl and IM2.Thus by the means of logics 409c, 409h and 409j addresses of a preselected value, in this case a decimal 51, are merely tested to determine whether a reset has occurred but are not permitted to address the array of ROM cells via decoders 409a and 409b. Addresses between a decimal 0 and 50 address the ROM normally via decoders 409a and 409b. The ROM matrix is preferably of the virtual ground type described in U.S. Patent 3,934,233. As aforementioned, the contents of ROM 409 are listed in Table XI.The chirp function is located at addresses 00 40 while zeroes are located at addresses 41 51.Truncation Logic and Digital To Analog Converter Turning again to FIGURES 11a 11d, the truncation logic 425 and Digital to Analog D A converter is shown in detail. Truncation logic 425 includes circuitry for converting the two s complement data on YL13 YL14 to sign magnitude data. Logics 425a test the MSB from Y latch 403 on line YL13 for the purpose of generating a sign bit and for controlling the two s complement to sign magnitude conversion accomplished by logics 425c. The sign bit is supplied in true and false logic on lines D Asn andD Asn to D A converter 426. Logics 425c convert the two s complement data from Y latches 403 in lines YL10 YL4 to simple magnitude notation on lines D A6 D A0. Only the logics 425c associated with YL10 are shown in detail for sake of simplicity. Logics 425b sample the YL12 and YL11 bits from the Y latches 403 and perform a magnitude truncation function thereon by forcing outputs D A6 through D Ao to a logic zero i.e., a value of one if the outputs were in true logic wherever either YL12 or YLr1 is a logical one and YL13 is a logical zero, indicating that the value is positive or either YL12 or YL11 is a logical zero and YL13 is a logical one, indicating that the value is negative and complemented, of course . Whenever one of these conditions occurs, a logical zero appears on line 427 and Vss is thereby coupled to the output buffer 428 in each of logics 425c. The magnitude function effectively truncates the more significant bits on YL11 and YL12.It is realized that this is somewhat unorthodox truncation, since normally the less significant bits are truncated in most other circuits where truncation occurs. However, in this circuit, large positive or negative values are effectively clipped. More important digital speech information, which has smaller magnitudes, is effectively amplified by a factor of four by this truncation scheme. The outputs D A6 7 A0, along with D Asn and D Asn are coupled to D A converter 426. D A converter 426 preferably has seven MOS devices 429 coupled to the seven linesD A6 through G from truncation logics 425. Devices 429 are arranged, by controlling their length to width rations, to pass different amounts of electrical current, the device 429 coupled to t7 passing twice as much current when on as the device 429 coupled to .Likewise the device 429 coupled to D A5 is capable of passing twice as much current as the device 429 coupled to D A4 This two to one current passing capability similarly applies to the remaining devices 429 coupled to the remaining linesD A3 D Ao Thus, device 429 coupled to D A1 is likewise capable of passing twice as much current as the device 429 coupled to D A2. All devices 429 are connected in parallel, one side of which are preferably coupled to Vss and the other side is preferably coupled to either side of the speaker 4 via transistors 430 and 431. Transistor 430 is controlled by D Asn which is applied to its gates transistor 431 is turned off and on in response to D Asn. Thus, either transistor 430 or 431 is on depending on the state of the sign bit, D Asn.The voice coil of speaker 4 preferably has a 100 ohm impedance and has a center tap connected to Vgg as shown in FIGURE 23a. Thus, the signals on lines DjA6 DAo control the magnitude of current flow through the voice coil while the signals on lines D Asn and D Asn control the direction of that flow. Alternatively to using a center tapped 100 ohm voice coil, a more conventional eight ohm speaker may be used along with a transformer having a 100 ohm center tapped primary connected to Vgg and transistors 430 and 431 and an eight ohm secondary connected to the speaker s terminals as shown in FIGURE 23b. In yet another embodiment, the center tap may be eliminated altogether by utilizing transistors 432 and 433 as shown in FIGURE 23c, which are not used in the embodiments utilizing the center tapped transformer or voice coil. It should now be appreciated by those skilled in the art that D A converter 426 not only converts digital sign magnitude information on lines D A6 D Ao andD Asn D Asn to an analog signal, but has effectively amplified this analog signal to sufficient levels to permit a speaker to be driven directly from the MOS synthesis chip 10 or via the aforementioned transformer, if desired . Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that simple D A converters, such as that disclosed here, will find use in other applications in addition to speech synthesis circuits. THE SPEECH SYNTHESIZER CHIP In FIGURE 22 a greatly enlarged plan view of a semiconductor chip which contains the entire system ofFIGURES 4a and 4b is illustrated. The chip is only about two hundred fifteen mils about 0.215 inches on.a side. In the example shown, the chip is manufactured by theP channel metal gate process using the following design rules metal line width 0.25 mil metal line spacing 0.25 mil diffusion line width 0.15 mil and diffusion line spacing 0.30 mil. Of course, as design rules are tightened with the advent of electron beam mask production or slice writing, and other techniques, it will be possible to further reduce the size of the synthesizer chip. The size of the synthesizer chip can, of course also be reduced by not taking advantage of some of the features preferable used on the synthesizer chip. The total active area of speech synthesizer chip 10 is approximately 45,000 square mils It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that other MOS manufacturing techniques, such asN channel, complementary MOS CMOS or silicon gate processes may alternatively be used. The various parts of the system are labeled with the same reference numerals previously used in this description CONTROLLER LOGIC DIAGRAMS The controller used in the learning aid is preferably a microprocessor of the type described in U.S.Patent 4,074,355, with modifications which are subsequently described. U.S. Patent 4,074,355 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. It is to be understood, of course, that other microprocessors, as well as future microprocessors, may well find use in applications such as the speaking learning aid described herein. The microprocessor of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 is an improved version of an earlier microprocessor described in U.S. Patent 3,991,305. One of the improvements concerned the elimination of digit driver devices so that arrays of light emitting diodes LED s forming a display could be driven directly from the microprocessor. As a matter of design choice, the display used with this learning aid is preferably a vacuum fluorescent VF display device. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that when LED s are directly driven, the display segments are preferably sequentially actuated while the display s common character position electrodes are selectively actuated according to information in a display register or memory.When VF displays are utilized, on the other hand, the common character position electrodes are preferably sequentially actuated while the segments are selectively actuated according to information in the display register or memory. Thus, the microprocessor of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 is preferably altered to utilize digit scan similar to that used in U.S. Patent 3,991,305. The microprocessor of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 is a four bit processor and to process alphanumeric information, additional bits are required. By using six bits, which can represent 26 or 64 unique codes, the twenty six characters of the alphabet, ten numerals as well as several communicated externally via pins SEG G, SEG B, SEG C and SEG D. The 91B type driver coupled to pin SEG E permits the contents of digit register 94 10 to be communicated externally when digit register 94 12 is set. The 91B type driver coupled to pinSEG A permits the contents of the program counter to be outputted during test operations. The digit buffers registers and TDO latches ofFIGURE 14 of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 are also preferably replaced with the digit buffers registers of FIGURE 17 herein inasmuch as 1 the DDIG signal is no longer used and 2 the digit latches elements 97 in U.S. Patent 4,074,355 are no longer used. For simplicity s sake, only one of the digit output buffer registers 94 is shown in detail. Further, since in this embodiment of the learning aid, display 2 perferably has eight character positions, eight output buffers 98 0 through 98 7 connect D0 D7 to the common electrodes of display 2 via registers 94 0 through 94 7 are shown in FIUGRE 17. An additional output buffer 98 8 communicates the contents of registers 94 12, which is the chip select signal, to synthesizer 10. To facilitate bi directional communication with sythesizer 10, the microprocessor of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 is preferably modified to permit bi directional communication on pins SEG G, SEG B, SEG C and SEG D. Thus, in FIGURE 18, these SEG pins are coupled to the normal K lines, 112 1 through 112 8, via an input selector 111a for inputting information when digit registers 94 12 R12 is set. Further, these pins are also coupled to ACC1 ACC8 via segment drivers 91A when digit registers 94 12 R12 and 94 11 R11 are set for outputting information in accumulator 77. Thus, when digit latch 94 12 which communicates the chip select signal externally is set, SEG E is coupled to R10 digit registers 94 10 for communicating the PDC signal to synthesizer 10. Also, ACC1 ACC8 is outputted on SEG G and SEG B SEG D, during the time R12 special characters can be handled with ease. In lieu of converting the microprocessor of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 directly to a six bit processor, it was accomplished indirectly by software pairing the four bit words into eight bit bytes and transmitting six of those bits to the display decoder. Referring now to FIGURES 15a 15b, which form a composite block diagram of the microprocessor preferably used in the learning aid, it should be appreciated that this block diagram generally corresponds with the block diagram of FIGURES 7a and 7b of U.S. Patent 4,074,355 several modifications to provide the aforementioned features of six bit operation and VF display compatibility are also shown.The numbering shown in FIGURES 15a and 15b generally agrees with that of U.S. Patent 4,074,355. The modifications will now be described in detail. Referring now to sthe composite diagram formed byFIGURES 16a 16b, which replace FIGURE 13 of U.S. Patent 4,074,355, there can be seen the segment decoder and RAM address decoder 33 1 which decodes RAMY for addressingRAM 31 or ACC1 ACC8 for decoding segment information.Decoder 33 1 generally corresponds to decoder 33 in the aforementioned U.S. Patent. The segment information is reencoded into particular segment line information in output section 32 2 and outputted on bus 90 to segment drivers 91.Six bits of data from the processor s four bit accumulator 77 are decoded in decoder 33 1 as is now described. First, four bits on bus 86 are latched into accumulator latches 87 1 through 87 8 on a TDO Transfer Data Out instruction when status is a logical one. Then, two bits on bus 86 from lines 86 1 and 86 2 are latched into accumulator latches 87 16 and 86 32, respectively, on another TDO instruction when status is a logical zero. Then the six bits in latches 87 1 through 87 32 is decoded in decoder 33 1. Segment drivers 91 may preferably be of one of three types, 91A, 91B or 91C as shown on FIGURES 16a 16b. The 91A type drivers permits the data on ACC1 ACC8 to be andR11 are set. When R11 is a logical 0, i.e., is reset, segment drivers 91A are turned off and data may be read intoCKB circuit 113 for receiving data from ROMs 12a 12b via synthesizer 10, for instance.FIGURE 18 replaces the keyboard circuit 111 shown in FIGURE 22 of U.S Patent 4,064,554. Preferably, pins SEG G and SEG B SEG D are coupled to CTL CTL8 pins of synthesizer 10, while pin SEG E is coupled to the PCD pin of synthesizer 10. In Table XII is listed the set of instructions which may be stored in the main Read Only Memory 30 ofFIGURES 15a 15b to provide controller 11. Referring now toTable XII, there are several columns of data which are, reading from left to right STMT Statement Number , PC ProgramCounter , CODE, PLOC Physical location , TITLE, and DEST Destination . In U.S. Patent 4,074,355, it can be seen that main Read Only Memory 30 is addressed with a seven bit address in program counter 47 and a four bit address in a buffer 60. The address in buffer 60 is referred to as a page address in the main Read Only Memory. The instructions listed onTable XII, ROM Page 0, correspond to page zero in the microprocessor while the instructions listed in Table XII, ROMPage 1 are those on page one and so forth through to the instructions in Table XII, ROM Page 15, which are stored on page fifteen in the microprocessor. The program counter 47 of the aforementioned microprocessor is comprised of a feedback shift register and therefore counts in a pseudorandom fashion, thus the addresses in the PC column of Table XII, which are expressed as a hexadecimal number, exhibit such pseudorandomness. If the instruction starting at page zero were read sequentially from the starting position in the program counter OO then the instruction would be read out in the order shown in Table XII. In the STMT column is listed a sequentially increasing decimal number associated with each source statement and its instruction and program counter address as well as those lines in which only comments appear.When an instruction requiring either a branch or call is to be performed, the address to which the program counter will jump and the page number to which the buffer will jump, if required, is reflected by the binary code comprising the instruction or instructions performing the branch or call. For sake of convenience, however, theDEST column indicates the statement number in Table XII to which the branch or call will be made. For example, the instruction at statement 107 is a branch instruction, with a branch address of 3E in hexadecimal. To facilitate finding the 3E address in the program counter, the DEST column directs the reader to statement 92 where the 3E address is located. READ ONLY MEMORY LOGIC DIAGRAMS Read Only Memories 12a or 12b or 13a or 13b are shown in FIGURES 19, 20a 20f and 21a d. FIGURE 19 is a block diagram of any of these ROMs. FIGURES 20a 20f form a composite logic diagram of the control logic for theROMs while FIGURES 20a and 20b form a composite logic diagram of the X and Y address decoders and pictorially show the array of memory cells. Referring now to FIGURE 19, the RAM array 601 is arranged with eight output lines, one output line from each section of 16,384 bits. The eight output lines fromROM array 601 are connected via an output latch 602 to an eight bit output register 603. The output register 603 is interconnected with pins ADD1 and ADD8 and arranged either to communicate the four high or low order bits from output register 603 via the four pins ADD1 ADD8 or alternatively to communicate the bit serially from output register 603 via pin ADD1. The particular alternative used may be selective according to mask programmable gates. ROM array 601 is addressed via a 14 bit address counter 604. The address counter 604 has associated therewith a four bit chip select counter 605. Addresses in address counter 604 and chip select counter 605 are loaded four bits at a time from pins ADD1 ADD8 in response to a decoded Load Address LA command. The first LA command loads the four least significant bits in address counter 604 bits A0 A3 , and subsequent LA commands load the higher order bits, A4 A7, A8 A11 and A12 A13 . During the fourth LA cycle the A12 and A13 bits are loaded at the same time the CSO and CS1 bits in chip select counter 605 are loaded. Upon the fifth LA command the two most significant bits in chip select counter 605 are loaded fromADD1 and ADD2.A counter 606 counts consecutively received LA commands for indicating where the four bits onADD1 ADD8 are to be inputted into counters 604 and or 605. Commands are sent to the ROM chip via Io and I1 pins to a decoder 607 which outputs the LA command a TB transfer bit and a RE read and branch command. Address register 604 and chip select register 605 have an add one circuit 608 associated therewith for incrementing the address contained therein. When a carry occurs outside the fourteen bit number stored in address register 604 the carry is carried into shift select register 605 which may enable the chip select function if not previously enabled or disable the chip select function if previously enabled, for example.Alternatively, the eight bit contents of output register 603 may be loaded into address register 604 by means of selector 609 in response to an RB command. During an RB command, the first byte read out of array 601 is used as the lower order eight bits while the next successive byte is used for the higher order six bits in counter 604. The output of chip select register 605 is applied via programmable connectors 610 to gate 611 for comparing the contents of chip select counter 605 with a preselected code entered by the programming of connectors 610. Gate 611 is also responsive to a chip select signal on the chip select pin for permitting the chip select feature to be based on either the contents of the four bit chip select register 605 and or the state of the chip select bit on theCS pin. The output of gate 611 is applied to two delay circuits 612, the output of which controls the output buffers associated with outputting information from output register 603 to pins ADD1 ADD8. The delay imposed by delay circuits 612 effect the two byte delay in this embodiment, because the address information inputted on pins ADD1 ADD8 leads the data outputted in response thereto by the time to required to access ROM array 601.The CS pin is preferably used in the embodiment of the learning aid disclosed herein. A timing PLA 600 is used for timing the control signals outputted to ROM array 601 as well as the timing of other control signals. Referring now to the composite drawing formed by FIGURES 20a to 20f, output register 603 is formed by eight A bit latches, an exemplary one of which is shown at 617.The output of register 603 is connected in parallel via a four bit path controlled on LOW and HIGH signals to output buffers 616 for ADD1 ADD4 and 616a for ADD8. Buffers 616 and 616a are shown in detail on FIGURES 21a 21d. Gates 615 which control the transferring of the parallel outputs from register 603 via in response to LOW and HIGH are preferably mask level programmable gates which are preferably not programmed when this chip is used with the learning aid described herein. Rather the data in register 603 is communicated serially via programmable gate 614 to buffer 616a and pin ADD8. The bits outputted to ADD1 ADD8 in response to a HIGH signal are driven from the third through sixth bits in register 603 rather than the fourth through seventh bits inasmuch as a serial shift will normally be accomplished between a LOW and HIGH signal. Address register 604 comprises fourteen of the bit latches shown at 617. The address in address 604 on lines A0 A13 is communicated to the ROM X and Y address buffers shown on FIGURE 21a 21d. Register 604 is divided into four sections 601a 601d, the 601d section loading four bits from ADD1 ADD8 in response an LAO signal, the 601c section loading four bits from ADD1 ADD8 in response to anLA1 signal and likewise for section 601b in response to anLA2 signal. Section 601a is two bits in length and loads the ADD1 and ADD2 bits in response to an LA2 signal. The chip select register 605 comprises four B type bit latches of the type shown at 618. The low order bits, CSO and CS1 are loaded from ADD4 and ADD8 in response to an LA3 signal while the high order bits CS2 and CS3 are loaded from ADD1 and ADD2 on an LA4 signal. The LAO LA4 signals are generated by counter 606. Counter 606 includes a four bit register 619 comprised of four A bit latches 617. The output of the four bit counter 619 is applied to a PLA 620 for decoding the LA1 LA4 signals. The LAO signal is generated by aNAND gate 621. As can be seen, the LAO signal comes up in response to an LA signal being decoded immediately after a TB signal. The gate 621 looks for a logical one on theLA signal and a logical one on an LTBD latched transfer bit delay signal from latch 622. Decoder 607 decodes the Io and I1 signals applied to pins Io and I1 for decoding the TB, LA and RB control signals. The signals on the and Ii pins are set out in Table XIII.Latch circuit 622 is responsive to LA, RB and TB for indicating whether the previously received instruction was either an LA or aTB or RB command. In addition to counting successive LA commands, four bit counter 609 and PLA 620 are used to count successiveTB commands. This is done because in this embodiment eachTB command transfers one bit from register 603 on pin ADD8 to the synthesizer chip 10 and output register 603 is loaded once each eight successive TB commands. Thus, PLA 620 also generates a TB8 command for initiating a ROM array addressing sequence. The timing sequence of counter 619 and PLA 620 are set forth in Table XIV. Of course, theLA1 LA4 signal is only generated responsive to successiveLA commands while the TB8 signals only generate in response to successive TB commands. Add one circuit 608 increments the number in program counter 604 in response to a TB command or an RB command.Since two successive bytes are used as a new address during anRB cycle, the card address and the present address incremented by one must be used to generate these two bytes.The output of add one circuit 608 is applied via selector 609 for communicating the results of the incrementation back to the input of counter 604. Selector 609 permits the bits in output register 603 to be communicated to program counter 604 during an RB cycle as controlled by signal BR from array 600. Add one circuit 608 is also coupled via COUNT to chip select counter 605 for incrementing the number stored therein whenever a CARRY would occur outside the fourteen bits stored in program counter 604. The output of chip select counter 605 is applied via programmable gate 610 to gate 611. The signal on the CS pin may also be applied to gate 611 or compared with the contents ofCS3.Thus, gate 611 can test for either 1 the state of the CS signal, 2 a specific count in counter 605 or 3 a comparison between the state on the chip select and the state of CS3 or 4 some combination of the foregoing, as may be controlled by those knowledgeable in the art according to how programmable links 610 are programmed during chip manufacture. The output of gate 611 is applied via two bit latches of the C type, which are shown at 622.Timing array 600 controls the timing of ROM sequencing during RB and TB sequences. Array 600 includes PLA sections 600a and 600b and counters 623 and 624. Counter 623 is a two bit counter comprising two A type bit latches shown at 617.Counter 63 counts the number of times a ROM access is required to carry out a particular instruction. For instance, a TB command requires one ROM access while anRB command requires three ROM accesses. Counter 624, which comprises four A type bit latches of the type shown at 617, counts through the ROM timing sequence for generating various control signals used in accessing ROM array 601.The timing sequence for a TB command is shown in Table XIV which depicts the states in counter 623 and 624 in the signals generated in response thereto. A similar timing sequence for an RB command is shown in Table XVI. The various signals generated by PLA 600a and 600b will now be briefly described. The BR signal controls the transfer of two serial bits from the output register 603 to the program counter 604. The TF signal controls the transfer of eight bits from the sense amp latch 602 FIGURE 21a21d to output register 603 on lines SAO SA7. INC controls the serial incrementing of the program counter, two bits for each INC signal generated. PC is the precharge signal for the ROM array and normally exists for approximately ten microseconds. The DC signal discharges the ROM 601 array and preferably lasts for approximately ten microseconds for each DC signal.This particular ROM array uses aroxiiatcly seventy microseconds to discharge and thus seven DC signals are preferably generated during each addressing sequence. SAM gates the data outputted from the ROM into the sense amp latch 602 while SAD sats the address lines by gating the address from the program counter into the ROM address buffers 625 FIGURES 21a21d .

TABLE VII The synthesizer 10 includes interpolation logics to accomplish a nearly linear interpolation of all twelve speech parameters at eight points within each frame, that is, once each 2.5 msec. The parameters are interpolated one at a time as selected by the parameter counter. The interpolation logics calculate a new value of a parameter from its present value i.e. the value currently stored in the K stack, pitch register or E iO loop and the target value stored in encoded form in RAM 203 and decoded by ROM 202 . The value computed by each interpolation is listed below. Where P. is the present value of the parameter, Pi 1 is the new parameter value Pt is the target value Ni is an integer determined by the interpolation counter The values of N. for specific interpolation counts and the valuesEMI70.1 PO is initial parameter value are as follows EMI70.2 tb SEP P.
