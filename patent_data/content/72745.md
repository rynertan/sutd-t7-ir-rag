# Braking apparatus for automotive vehicles.

## Abstract
Braking apparatus 28 , comprising a master cylinder 40 for supplying pressurized fluid to the brakes of the vehicle, a hydraulic booster 42 for assisting the master cylinder to effect a brake application, a fluid pumping section 44 driven by an electric motor for supplying pressurized fluid to the hydraulic booster and a reservoir 46 supplying a single fluid to the various parts of the apparatus. The electric motor driving the fluid pumping section 44 receives energy from the vehicle only in response to a need for braking, and the braking apparatus includes a fluid pressure accumulator 147 providing pressurized fluid to the booster 42 during the first phase of a brake application, until the fluid pumping section 44 is able to supply a greater fluid pressure to the booster to achieve a second phase of brake application while simultaneously recharging the accu mulator.
