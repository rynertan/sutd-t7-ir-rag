# Method of casting using expendable patterns.

## Abstract
A method of casting a metal article in a mould box comprises locating an expendable pattern in the box, the pattern having a gas permeable refractory coating thereon, placing and compacting unbonded particulate material about the pattern and supplying molten metal into the box so as to vaporise or burn away the pattern and form the article of defined shape while applying a vacuum during casting. According to this invention, the method is improved by compacting the particulate material to a maximum bulk density where it contacts the coated pattern and applying a vacuum to the compacted particulate material so as to create sufficient pressure gradient in the height of the compacted material to maintain the integrity of the gas permeable refractory coating. In this way, the risk of mould collapse. metal breakout, and pollution are reduced.
