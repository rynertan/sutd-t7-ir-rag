# Alignment or correction of energy beam type displays.

## Abstract
Multiple energy beams in a display, such as a color TV tube or computer terminal, can be accurately aligned or corrected using information acquired with a photodetector having a single sensitive spot which is precisely placed on the viewing surface of the display and the display unit, in turn, is equipped to be able independently to disable, to position, and to vary the intensity of each beam.
