# Multicomponent polyester feed yarn for draw texturing, process for the preparation thereof and process of draw texturing the same.

## Abstract
Polyester feed yarn for drawtexturing, having an elongation at break of 30 to 150 percent, is composed of three different types of filaments. A 20 to 40 percent of the filaments consist of a polymer of ethylene terephthalate and 0 to 3 mole percent of modifying groups for imparting cationic dyeability. B 20 to 40 percent of the filaments consist of a copolymer of ethylene terephthalate and about 5 to 15 mole percent of other ester units. C 15 to 35 weight percent of the yarn consist of eccentric bicomponent filaments of the above two polymers. The bicomponent filaments have a smaller denier and lower elongation at break than the other filaments, so that the bicomponent filaments can be broken preferentially when the yarn is drawtextured to provide spun like tactility. When broken, the bicomponent filaments helically crimp and become entangled in the yarn bundle with a slight, uniform protrusion of ends above the surface which provides good resistance to pilling in fabrics.
