## Description
HERBICIDAL COMPOSITION AND METHODS This Invention is concerned with novel herbicidal compositions and methods for the control and or inhibition of the growth and reproductlon of plants of many undesirable annual and perennial monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants In graminaceous crops such as cereals and legume crops such as peas belng grown for human or animal consumption. The terms herblclde and herbicidal as used herein refer to materlals or compositions which either effectively control all plantsIn a given locus or selectively control the growth of one or more plant species In the presence of other plants. The term control as used hereln Is Inclusive of the actions of 1 killing 2 inhibiting growth, reproductlon or proliferation and 3 removing, destroying or otherwlse diminishing the occurrence and activity of plants and Is applicable to any of the stated actions or combinations thereof. The term plant as used herein Is inclusive of germinating seeds, emerging seedlings and herbaceous vegetation Including the roots and above ground portlons. The term cereals covers annual monocotyledonous crops grown for food production such as wheat, oats, barley and sorghum. The legume crops may be annual such as peas and lupins or perennials such as clover. Control of weeds Is a continuing problem. Although the use of herbicides has greatly increased In recent years there are still many practical problems associated with weed control which have not been satisfactorily resolved. In all cropping areas of the world both broadleaf dicotyledonous and grass monocotyledonous weeds are maJor problems In cropping areas where cereal and legume crops are grown.Weed control in the major proportlon of cereal and legume crops Is obtained by applying post emergent sprays of herbicides to the emerged crop and weeds. There Is no one herbicide that will selectively control the total range of annual and perennlal weeds that occur in these crops so It Is normal practice for a combination of up to 3 or 4 herbicides to be applied at one time to control the range of broadleaf weeds occurrlng In a particular crop.The herbicides used for the selective control of grass weeds In cereal and legume crops are very specific In thelr activity and have little effect on broadleaf weeds at the rate of application used for grass weed control and normally are mixed with the broadleaf herbicides or applled as a separate treatment. Post emergent selective grass herbicides are used widely to control annual grasses such as Lollum rialdum. Avena fatua and perennial grasses such as Lollum perenne and Agrostls stolonifera. Examples of post emergent selective grass herbicides Include methyl N benzOyl N 3 chloro 4 fluorophenyl 2 aminoproplonate flamprop methyl , l,2 dimethyl 3,5 diphenylpyrazollum difenzoquat , and methyl 2 E4 2,4 dlchlorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate diclofop methyl . In particular, diclofop methyl Is used at an early stage of development of both the grass species and the crop In various crops but In cereals Is usually used In combination with broadleaf herbicides which normally Include some of the substituted phenoxyalkanoic herbicides such as 2,4 D, MCPA, dichlorprop and mecoprop. Antagonism can be defined as the reduced activity of one chemical following its combination with another chemical. In other words, the sum of the effects of two or more chemicals when combined Is less than the total effects of the chemicals when used alone. The fact that the mixing of certaln substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids with dlclofop methyl can be antagonistic to the grass control obtained is well known. F. Qureshi and W. Vanden Born, 1979, interaction ofDlclofop methyl and MCPA on wild oats , Weed Science 27, 202 205, conclude that the loss of activity of dlclofop methyl by MCPA ester can be accounted for by the effects of MCPA on uptake and metabolic converslon of diclofop methyl . W. A. Olson, 1979, MCPA antagonism of wild oat control with diclofopt, Dlssertatlon Abstracts Internatlonal B 1979 39, 10 , conducted fleld, greenhouse and laboratory experiments to determine the extent and mechanism of MCPA antagonism of wlld oat control with dlclofop. WlId oat control with the tank mixture of dlclofop at 2.25 kg ha and MCPA at 0.14 or 0.28 kg ha was similar to the wild oat control of dlclofop applied alone at 1.12 kg ha. MCPA antagonism of wild oat control with diclofop Increased as the post treatment temperature Increased from 100 to 300C.The results Indlcate that MCPA antagonism of wild oat control with diclofop results from MCPA inhibition of diclofop transiocation In the phloem. Roumellotis, 1979, InteractTons between some wild oat herbicides and four chiorophenoxy compounds , PANS 25 4 425 430, investigated three wild oat herbicides benzoylprop ethyl, flamprop Isopropyl, and flamprop methyl, which were applied In mixtures with the chlorophenoxy herbicides 2,4 D, dichlorprop, MCPA and mecoprop.He concluded all mixtures Induced significantly less suppresslon of growth In oats than that Induced by the wild oat herbicides alone at the lower rates. This effect demonstrated the existence of antagonism between the three wild oat herbicides and the four chlorophenoxy compounds tested. Antagonism was Inversely related to the amount of wild oat herbicides present In the mixture . B. Shirtcilffe and J. Kaleta, 1977, Wild oat control with Mataven tank mixed and time interval with MCPA ester , Research Report, CanadaWeed Committee, Western Section, Part 1, 390 391, observed that Wild oat control was reduced when flamprop methyl was tank mlxed with bromoxynil . In a further trlal, the same authors, 1977, Wlld oat control with Mataven tank mixed and time intervals with bromoxynil MCPA ester , Research Report, Canada Weed Committee, Western Section, Part 1, 391 392, reported Wlld oat control was reduced when flamprop inethyl was tank mixed with bromoxynil MCPA ester . A. Slater and B. Jones, 1978, The compatibility of hydroxybenzonitrile based herbicides with other cereal sprays ,Proceedings 1978 British Crop Protectlon Conference Weeds 423 430, conducted trials with the iso octyl esters of hydroxybenzonitriles in combination with varlous grass herbicides and reported that dlclofop methyl was the least compatible of those tested. M. M. Schrelber and P. L. Orwick, 1978, Antagonistic actlon of 2,4 DB on dlclofop methyl , Abstracts, 1977, Meeting Weed ScienceSoclety, America 1978 3, observed field and glasshouse studies of the post emergence use of 2,4 DB in combination with diclofop methyl for the control of weed grasses. Results suggest that such combinations were less effective In controlling weed grasses than when dlclofopmethyl was used alone . J. Swarbrick, 1984, The Australian Weed Control Handbook, 7 Edit., 244, which is the current reference for product label claims InAustralia states Allow at least 10 days between any application ofHOEGRASS diclofop methyl and other herbicides containing 2,4 0, MCPA, dlcamba and other similar type sprays, which should preferably follow HOEGRASS . These references demonstrate the wide acceptance In the scientific literature and the commerclal use of diclofop methyl that antagonism by a range of substituted phenoxyalkanolc acids, whether they be salts or esters, does exist. In an endeavour to overcome this problem, the rate of application of dlclofop methyl may be increased compared with that when It Is used alone, the timing of application may be varled, or It may be better to apply the grasskiller as a separate application up to 10 days from applying the broadleaf herbicides. This causes considerable management problems and greater cost to the user to obtaln a satisfactory level of weed control. One group of chemicals, the substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids, their salts and esters, have been and still are widely used for the selective control of broadleaf weeds In cereal and legume crops. The phenoxyacetle herbicides have been used on both cereal and pasture crops whereas the phenoxybutyric herbicides have malnly been used on legume crops or cereal crops under sown with legumes due to their greater selectivity to legumes. The phenoxybutyric herbicides may also be formulated In mixtures with other broadleaf herbicides such as bromoxynil which contalns the active ingredient 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile as an ester. The object of this Invention is to provide novel herbicide compositlons and methods for the Improved selective control of annual and perennlal grass weeds in cereal and legume crops where dlclopfopmethyl and slmllar post emergent grass herbicides have to be mixed with substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids. By Improved is meant that substantially no antagonism occurs when the mixture of herbicides Is applied.Indeed, the degree of control of weed grasses Is frequently greater than with the use of the grass herbicide alone, demonstrating synerg I sm. According to the present Invention, It has been found that the growth and reproductlon of many undesirable grass weeds in association with broadleaf weeds In cereal and legume crops can be selectively controlled and or inhibited by applying to the said weedy grasses or broadleaf plants or plant parts or soil the novel herbicide composition which Is comprised of 1 part by weight active Ingredient of methyl 2 C4 2,4 dchlorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate and either a from 0.5 to 2 parts by weight active ingredient of 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy butyric acid MCPB , or an ester or oil soluble amine salt thereof, or b from 0.3 to 3 parts by weight active ingredIent of a herbicidal compound mixture containing I 1 part by weight of 4 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy butyric acid, or an ester or oil soluble amine salt thereof, and Il from 0.75 to 1.5 parts by weight of a hydroxybenzonitrile compound selected from 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxy benzonitrile, 4 hydroxy 3,5 di iodobenzonitri le, and esters thereof. The esters, both of the phenoxyalkanoic acid compound and of the hydroxybenzonitrile compound, preferably have from 1 to 8 carbon atomsIn the ester moiety. The method of the invention for the control and or Inhibition of the growth and reproduction of many undesirable grass weeds and broadleaf weeds In cereal or legume crops comprises applying to the weedy plant or plant parts or to their growth medlum a growth alterlng amount of a composition as defined In the preceding paragraph. The amount of the herbicide composition applied In the method of this invention is usually sufficient to apply 300 to 750 grams per hectare of methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate and 400 to 800 grams per hectare of 4 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy butyric acid as an ester or oil soluble amine salt or sufficlent to apply 300 to 750 grams per hectare of methyl 2 E4 2,4 dichiorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate and 100 to 600 grams per hectare of 4 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy butyric acid as an ester or oil soluble amine salt In combination with 75 to 450 grams per hectare of 3,5 dlbromo 4 hydroxy benzonitrile or 4 hydroxy 3,5 dI iodobenzonitri le as esters. The herbicidal compositions of the invention usually consist of the active ingredients In admixture with one or more dlluents, adJuvants and or carrlers which are conventional in herbicide compositlons. The compositions may, for example, be formulated as oil miscible concentrates or emulslflable concentrates. The compositions are conveniently applled to the plants or plant parts as dlluted or ready to use spray. A preferred method of the invention for selectively controlling grass and broadleaf weeds In cereal and legume crops comprises applying about 400 grams active Ingredient of methyl 2 E4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate plus 200 grams active Ingredient of 4 4 chloro2 methylphenoxy butyric acid plus 200 grams active Ingredient of 3,5 dibromo 4 hydroxy benzonitrile per hectare. This method substantially destroys all the weeds while still being selective to the cereal and legume crop.The corresponding composition, which comprises 1 part by weight active ingredient of methyl 2 4 2,4 dichiorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate plus 0.5 part by weight active Ingredient of 4 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy butyric acid as an ester or oil soluble amine salt plus 0.5 part by weight active ingredient of 3,5 dibromo 4hydroxy benzonitrile as an ester, Is thus a preferred composition of the invention. These novel compositions containing the esters of 4 2 methyl 4chlorophenoxy butyric acid do not have any significantly antagonistic effect on methyl 2 E4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy3 propionate when the compounds are mixed and appiled at the rates normally used for the control of broadleaf and grass weeds. This Is qulte unexpected when one considers the antagonism which occurs with other substituted phenoxyalkanolc acid compounds when mixed with methyl 2 4 2,4 dichlorophenoxy phenoxy proplonate. The said compositions may Instead have a synergistic activity as evidenced by an Increased activity on grassy weeds and, in cereal crops, the admIxture of herbicidal compounds In the compositions provides improved selectivity of the crop to both the broadleaf and grass weed herbicides used for control.These properties of the compositions of the present invention are deemed wholly novel and unexpected. The invention Is Illustrated by the following non limitative Composition and Trial Examples. Composition 1.

The major weeds on the fleld sltes are noted In the particularExamples. Application of the compositions and method In the Examples were a A precision hand broadcast sprayer calibrated to apply 200 300 litres per hectare at a nozzle pressure of 250 300 kPa. I b A precision hand broadcast sprayer calibrated to apply 90 litres per hectare at a nozzle pressure of 250 kPa. In Examples 1 to 6 the treatments for the fleld trials were applled durlng the perlod from early autumn to late spring when the broadleaf weeds were in the 2 6 leaf stage of growth and the grass 3weeds were In the 1 5 leaf stage of growth or, In the case of perennlal ryegrass, Lolium perenne , mature plants. At the times of treatment, the stage of growth of the clover ranged from the first trifoliate leaf through to mature stolons and the cereal crops ranged froc 2 leaf to early tillerlng stage. The two trlals reported In Examples 3 and 4 were conducted under conditions Ideal for vigorous growth of the crop and weeds. The two trlals reported In Examples 5 and 6 were conducted in the same region in the following year under drought conditions when both the crop and the weeds were under severe stress which limited growth. A standard method was used for the evaluation of control of wild oats or cultivated oats grown under glass. The seed was sown in trays containing soll and 10 plants were selected per tray. The herbicide compositions were applied with a belt sprayer at 300 lItres per hectare at a nozzle pressure of 200 kPa. Plants were treated at the 2 4 leaf stage and harvested 21 days after treatment with the fresh weight of all follage being recorded. Each treatment was replicated three times.The mean fresh welghts were used as a measure of growth suppression caused by the various herbicide compositions. The following data are the results of the herbicidal composition effects on the named plants wherein the treated plant growths are expressed as a percent of the growth of untreated plants at the same locus. The observed growth measurements are the mean of at least twoIndependent visual observations of the treated plant. In someInstances actual counts have been made of surviving treated weed plants per unit areas and expressed as a percentage of the standard treatment.Mean crop yields were determined by harvesting with a self propelled small plot harvester and results expressed as tonnes per hectare of grain.
