# Device for converting wind energy into another form of energy.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for converting wind energy into another form of energy comprising a plurality of propellers having equidirectional shafts, being arranged in a matrix and driving associated energy converters. The invention generally proposes to design a device of the kind set forth in a manner such that the occupation density is at least 0.4 propellers per square metre. By this step a device is obtained, whose propellers are so small that the profile can satisfy an ideal profile with great accuracy without excessive increase in production costs. Furthermore, the number of revolutions during normal operation may be very appreciably higher than that of a known device so that the device only produces hardly troublesome, rustling noise, the level of which depends on wind force and thrust loads do no longer occur.
