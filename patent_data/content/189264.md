# Packaging film feed.

## Abstract
A parallelogram feed system for packaging film is provid ed. The system includes a pair of idler guide rollers 28, 28a bodily moveable between a feed position adjacent the packag ing film T and a rest position away from the packaging film. Drive rollers 30, 30a are provided away from the packaging film. An endless drive belt 88 extends around the rollers 28, 28a, 30, 30a . An overlapping feed belt 86 tensioned by rollers 90 engages the packaging film T between the two guide rollers 28, 28a when in the feed position. With this dual piggyback belt system the surface of the feed belt 86 is matched for maximum affinity to the film T and the drive belt 88 exhibits maximum driving capability and extended life. The rollers 28, 28a, 30, 30a are linked together by four con necting links 36, 38, 40, 42 in the shape of a parallelogram that are pivotally attached to the shafts 32 a d to which the rollers are rotatably mounted. A pneumatic cylinder 46 moves the guide rollers 28, 28a between the feed and rest positions. The cylinder 46 is attached to the link 36 connec ting the two guide rollers 28, 28a by means of a pin 48 slidably received in an elongated slot 44 in the connecting link so as to allow parallelogram shifting movement. In addition, optional air passages 64 may be provided for directing a cushion of air beneath the packaging film T adjacent the feed system belts 86, 88 . The air cushion lifts the film T from the mandrel 14 of the packaging machine into contact with the feed belts 86 while reducing dynamic friction between the film and the mandrel.
