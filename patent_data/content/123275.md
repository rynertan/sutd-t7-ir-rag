# Operational amplifier circuit.

## Abstract
An operational amplifier having a differential amplifier section 10 , a level shifting section 20 , an output section 30 and a bias section 60 . In the operational amplifier, the bias section 60 senses any changes in the power voltage and controls the level shifting of the level shifting section 30 with the sensed change in the power voltage so as to remove an offset component in the output voltage of the differential amplifier section 0 which arises from the power voltage change.
