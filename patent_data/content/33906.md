# Process for the production of aromatic sulfide sulfone polymers.

## Abstract
Aromatic sulfide sulfone polymers are prepared by initially contacting a dihaloaromatic sulfone, an alkali metal sulfide, an organic amide, and, optionally, an alkali metal carboxylate under polymerization conditions and subse quently at or near completion of the polymerization reac tion, adding an end capping agent comprising additional dihaloaromatic sulfone to the reaction mixture producing a polymer exhibiting improved physical properties including melt flow stability. The resulting polymers have utility as coatings, films, molded objects, filaments, fibers, and the like.
