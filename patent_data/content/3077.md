# A tractor draft load monitoring system.

## Abstract
A tractor draft load monitoring system 12, 14, 26 responsive to tractor and associated implement load changes. The system is particularly adapted for a tractor having an engine transmission power unit 11 coupled to its drive shaft 12 . The power unit is mounted on the frame 13 by resilient mounts 14 that permit measurable angular displacement of the power unit 11 relative to the frame 13 about the drive shaft axis 12 in reaction to changes in the drive shaft torque. The working depth of the implement, which may be tractor mounted, semi mounted or a pull type implement, is raised or lowered by a hydraulic lift system that is controlled by a control valve assembly 26 connected to a source of fluid under pressure. Interposed between the power unit 11 and the control valve assembly 26 is a transmission cable Bowden wire type and lever system 27 that is operative to transmit angular displacement of the power unit 11 to an actuating member of the control valve assembly 26 to cause hydraulic actuation of the hydraulic lift device to change the working depth of the implement to compensate for changes in its draft load.
