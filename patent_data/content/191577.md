## Abstract
A faucet for mixing hot and cold water includes a valve casing 10, cold and hot water inlet pipes 62, 64 coupled to the valve casing, first and second outlet pipes 70, 80 coupled to the valve casing, a valve housed in the valve casing and having a fixed plate 30 and a movable plate 40, and an actuator for angularly moving the movable plate. The fixed plate has at least one cold water passage hole 32 communicating with the cold water inlet pipe, at least one hot water passage hole 33 com municating with the hot water inlet pipe, a first outlet hole 34 communicating with the first outlet pipe, and a second outlet hole 35 communicating with the second outlet pipe. The mov able plate is held rotatably slidably against the fixed plate in watertight relation and has a recess 42 defined in the surface thereof slidably contacting the fixed plate. When the movable plate is angularly moved by the actuator 50, at least one of the cold and hot water passage holes is brought into selective com munication with the first and second outlet holes through the recess 42.
