# Method and apparatus for weighing and grading fowls hanging from shackles.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for weighing and grading fowl hanging from shackles of a continuously moving overhead conveyor, having a plurality of balance arms extending ra dially outwards from the vertical central axis of the appa ratus and being pivotably supported by slide blocks moun ted on vertical guide bars rotating about the central axis and driven by the overhead conveyor. The outer ends of the balance arms are adapted, while moving along with the conveyor at the same speed, to catch and lift the shackles so that they are no longer supported by the conveyor by moving the slide blocks upwards, and the inner ends of the balance arms are adapted to come to bear on a load cell located in the central axis when given free by a locking pin.
