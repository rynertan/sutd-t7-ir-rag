# Magnetic reproducing apparatus capable of receiving radio broadcast programmes and a tuner unit insertable in magnetic reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
Magnetic reproducing apparatus is disclosed which is capable of receiving radio broadcast programmes. A tuner unit 33 having substantially the same shape and size as a tape cassette is inserted in the magnetic reproducing apparatus. This tuner unit includes a tuner circuit. At least one first electrode 47 is positioned on the tuner unit as an output terminal of the tuner unit. At least one second electrode is positioned on the apparatus body. The first electrode 47 reliably contacts the second electrode when the tuner unit is inserted in the holding portion of the magnetic reproducing apparatus to enable reception and playing of radio programmes.
