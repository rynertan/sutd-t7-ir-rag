## Description
METHOD OF MEASURING A SPOT SIZE OF A SINGLE MODE FIBER The present invention relates to a method of measuring the spot size or the mode field radius of a single mode optical fiber. Various methods of measuring the spot size have heretofore been proposed. One of such methods is illustrated in Fig. l a . In Fig. 1 a , a beam to be measured is emitted by a light source 1 and applied through an optical system 2 to an optical fiber 3.The near field pattern hereinafter referred to as an NFP at an end of the optical fiber remote from the optical system 2 is measured directly by an optical system 4 and an infrared vidicon camera 5, an example of the result of such measurement being shown in Fig. l b . The spot size w0 is determined which is defined by i the radial distance w0 in which NFP is reduced from its maximum to lie2, wherein e is the base of the natural logarithm or EMI2.1 wherein 1R r 12 is NFP, and r is the radius of the optical fiber. Reference numerals 6 and 7 represent a camera control and a computer, respectively.The conventional method is disadvantageous in that measurement errors are liable to occur due to nonlinear photoelectric conversion characteristics of the vidicon camera and the irregular sensitivity of the vidicon camera. Furthermore, since the optical system 5 requires the use of a lens system for enlarging the image, measurement errors also tend to be caused by aberrations of the lenses. The above prior art method therefore fails to make an accurate measurement. Another method of determining the spot size from the far field pattern hereinafter referred to as FFP is disclosed by Gambling et al. inIEE J. Microwave Opt.Acoust. Vol. 1, p13, 1976. This method is a simplified method based on the assumption that NFP is a Gaussian distribution. However, this method is subjected to the risk of large measurement errors since NFP of a single mode optical fiber actually manufactured may vary with the distribution of refractive indexes in the cross section of the fiber, deviating from the Gaussian distribution. The method cannot be applied in principle to the measurement of the spot size based on the equation 1 or the like because NFP is not directly determined. The present invention has been made in an effort to eliminate the above described drawbacks. According to the present invention, there is disclosed a method of measuring the spot size of a single mode optical fiber1 comprising the steps of measuring the far field pattern of a beam emitted from an end of the single mode optical fiber in a range from the radiation angle, at which the far field pattern is maximum, to the radiation angle at which the far field pattern is reduced 25 dB or smaller, calculating the near field pattern from the measured far field pattern by the use of Hankel transform, and determining the spot size from the calculated near field pattern according to a prescribed definition formula. The method of the invention is capable of highly accurate measurement without using an infrared vidicon camera, having the problems of nonlinear photoelectric conversion characteristics and irregular vidicon sensitivity, and a lens system having aberrations.Furthermore, the method can be applied with any definition formula for the determination of the spot size. The invention is described below with reference to the drawings, in which Fig. l a is a block diagram showing an arrangement for the conventional NFP measuring method Fig. l b is a diagram showing an example of the result of measurement according to the conventional measuring method Fig. 2 is a diagram showing the relationship between NFP and FFP Fig. 3 is a graph showing a calculated example ofFFP of a stepped single mode optical fiber Fig. 4ta is a set of graphs showing the relationship between spot size measurement errors and minimum values of the relative power of FFP at the time the maximum radiation angle is varied when FFP is measured, wherein Fig. 4 a is a graph showing the FFP minimum power values at the time the maximum radiation angle is varied andFig. 4 b is a graph showing the spot size measurement errors at the time the maximum radiation angle is varied and Fig. 5 is a block diagram illustrative of a measuring system performing a method according to the present invention. Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in connection with a preferred embodiment. The relationship between electric field distributions of NFP and FFP of a single mode optical fiber is expressed as follows according to Kirchhoff s diffraction theory EMI5.1 wherein F and R r are the electric field distributions of FFP and NFP, respectively, k 2v A A wavelength , JO is Bessel function of order 0, and e is the radiation angle.The relationship is diagramatically illustrated in Fig. 2 wherein reference numerals 8, 9 and 10 respectively represent an optical fiber, a core, and one end of the optical fiber from which the beam is emitted, and reference numeral 11 represents the plane on which FFP is observed. From the above equation 2 is derived the following expression, when Hankel transform is used EMI5.2 Therefore, R r can be determined by determining F e which can be determined by measuring IF 8 12 which represents FFP.By using the formula 3 , R r can be determined, and 1R r 12 which represents NFP can be determined by a calculation. From this NFP, the spot size w0 according to various definitions, particularly one as defined by the formula 1 , can be determined. However, FFP lF e j2 can only be measured in. finite radiation angles e because of the reception sensitivity of the measurement system. As is apparent from the equation 3 , R r or NFP IR e 12 can not completely be inversely calculated. According to the present invention, NFP is inversely calculated from FFP measured in a range 0 e 5 emax of finite radiation angles e, a measurement error is ascertained at the time the spot size w0 has been determined, and the range of measurement of FFP is determined so that the measurement error of the spot size falls in an allowable range. The above process will be described with reference to Figs. 3 and 4.Fig. 3 shows the calculated values of FFP at the time a beam to be measured having a wavelength A 1.30 m is applied to a single mode optical fiber having a specific refractive index difference ss 0.3 and a core diameter R r according to the following scalar wave equation d2R r 1 dR r k2na r ss23R r 0 4 drê r dr and determining R r by the use of the above formula 2 to thereby obtain FFP IF e I2 . From Fig. 3 the spot size w0 is inversely calculated at the time e max in the FFP measurement range 0 e emax is varied to various values. More specifically, F ê corresponding to a certain e is determined from Fig. 3, and F e is determined from the determined F ê. 12, R r is determined from the formula 3 , and R r ê is determined from the determined R r . w0 is found by substituting the determined value for tR r 2 in the formula 1 . This procedure is carried out with respect to various values of emax. A strict value w0 of the spot size can be obtained by determining R r from the scalar wave equation 4 , determining jR r 12, and substituting the determined value for IR r I2 in the formula 1 . Fig. 4 b shows w0 plotted as spot size calculation errors in comparison with the strict value w01 when emax is varied to various values. Fig. 4 a illustrates maximum values of the relative intensity of FFP at the time Gmax is varied to various values with respect to spot size calculation errors. The spot size measurement error should normally be in the range of about 2 , and, hence, the calculation error which will be produced in calculating inversely the spot size from FFP would be in the range of about 28. Fig. 4 a indicates that the error of calculation of the spot size can be reduced to 2 or below by measuring FFP in a range from a radiation angle indicative of the maximum value of FFP to a radiation angle at which FFP is reduced 25 dB or smaller. Fig. 5 illustrates a measuring system utilizing the method of the present invention. The system includes a light source 12, an optical system 13, an optical fiber 14 to be measured, Ge APD 15, a signal amplifier 16, and a computer 17. The light source 12 is preferably a laser beam source capable of emitting as high and stable an output as possible. In an example in which a semiconductor laser was used as the light source, a dynamic range of 36 dB could be achieved. The computer 17 determines F e from FFP IF e 12 in a range from the radiation angle indicative of the maximum value of FFP to a radiation angle at which FFP is reduced 25 dB or smaller, determines R r from the formula 3 , then determines IR r I2 which is NFP, and calculates a spot size w0 using the definition formula such as 1 . An example of measurement according to the present invention will be described. The table 1 shows, for comparison, the measured results according to the conventional method as shown in Fig. l a and the measured results according to the arrangement of the present invention. In the measurement, the spot size of a single mode optical fiber was measured ten times by each of the methods, and average values of the spot size and standard deviations 6 were determined. The table 1 clearly shows that the standard deviation 6 according to the method of the invention can be reduced to about 1 2 through 1 4 of that according to the prior method, thus greatly reducing the measurement error.
