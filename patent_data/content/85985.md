By way of examples, pharmacological test procedures are described below. 1 An isolated and cross circulated papillary muscle preparation of the dog An isolated and cross circulated papillary muscle preparation of the dog was prepared according to the method of Endo and Hashimoto see American J. Physiol., 218, 1459 1463, 1970 U. S. A. . A test compound dissolved in a solvent was applied by proximal intraarterial injection and its effect on contrac tility of the papillary muscle was determined. The results are shown in Table 1. 2 Isolated left atrium of the guinea pig Male guinea pigs weighing 200 300 g were stunned by a blow on the head and the hearts were quickly excised and placed in a Petri dish containing oxygen ated Krebs Hensleit solution The left atrium was excised. A fine cotton suture was attached to the left atrial appendage. The tissue was mounted in a 30 ml organ bath filled with Krebs Hensleit solution at 37 C and oxygenated with 95 O2 5 CO2 mixture. The cotton thread was then attached to a force displacement transducer connected to a polygraph. A silver wire electrode connected to a stimulator was placed at the bottom of the preparaticn. Resting tension applied was 0.5 g. The preparation was driven electrically by a stimulator at a rate of 120 min. with suprathreshold rectangular pulses of 1 msec duration. The preparation was left to equi librate for 1 hour. The test compounds dissolved in vehicle were added to the organ bath and the response was recorded. The results are shown in Table 1. 3 Intact anesthetized dog preparation Mongrel dogs of either sex weighing 8 13 kg were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 30 mg kg i.v. . A tracheal cannula was inserted and arti ficial respiration was carried out by means of a Harvard respiration. The left femoral vein was cannulated for intravenous bolus injection of the test compounds. The chest was opened at the left 4th intercostal space, the heart was exposed, and a Walton Brodie type strain gauge was sutured to the wall of the right ventricle to measure myocadial contractile force. A polyethylene cannula connected to a transducer was introduced into the left ventri cle through the ventricular wall and left ventricular pressure was measured. Peak positive rate of rise of left ventricular pressure dP dt max was obtained by an electric differentiator.The test compounds were dissolved in appropriate vehicle and intra venously administered. The results are shown in Table 1. The values for LD50 were determined by the LitchfieldWilcoxon method J. T. Litchfield and F. Wilcoxon, J.Pharmacol. exp. Therap., 96, 99 1949 .
