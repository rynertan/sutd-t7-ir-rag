# Gas turbine combustor.

## Abstract
A gas turbine combuster has a plurality of burner units each having an inner tube 4 defining a combustion chamber therein and an outer tube 5 surrounding the inner tube 4 coaxially therewith. A fuel is injected into the head portion of the inner tube 4 and is burnt in the combustion chamber to produce hot combustion gases which are guided through a tail tube 14 to stationary blades of a gas turbine. Combustion air is supplied through an annular passage 15 between the inner and outer tubes from the area 13 around the tail tube 14 to the head portion of the inner tube 4 . A flow uniformalizing tube 29 is disposed between the inner 4 and outer 5 tubes to cooperate with the inner tube 4 to define therebetween an air passage.The flow uniformalizing tube 29 imparts a great er flow resistance to air flow from the back side of the tail tube 14 than to the air flow from the side thereof diametrically re mote from the back side, so that the flow velocity of the air flowing through the air passage is substantially uniformalized in the circumferential direction of the inner tube 4 .
