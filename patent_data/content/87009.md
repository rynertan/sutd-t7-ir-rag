# Microword control system utilizing multiplexed programmable logic arrays.

## Abstract
A microword control system is provided for producing the sequences of microwords used to control the execution of processor instructions in a microprogrammed digital data processor. This microword control system includes a plural ity of programmable logic array mechanisms 301 304 responsive to the processor instruction in 305 to be executed for individually producing different ones of the microwords needed to execute such instruction. This micro word control system also includes microword responsive control circuitry 310 313 for controlling the operation of the odata processor. This microword control system further it includes mutliplexing circuitry 315 318 for supplying microwords from different ones of the programmable logic array mechanisms 301 304 to the control circuitry 310 313 during different time intervals.
