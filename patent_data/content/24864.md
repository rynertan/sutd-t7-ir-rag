# Rubber adhesive compositions, gluesticks containing them and a process for their production.

## Abstract
Synthetic rubber based adhesives comprising a solution of a a linear branched chain polyurethane rubber, b a carboxylated butadiene acrylonitrile rubber, con taining at least 50 butadiene by weight, and c the reaction product of sorbitol and benzaldehyde in a non aqueous solvent system and, optionally, d a non aqueous solution of a phenolic resin, are form retentive and are useful in glue sticks.
