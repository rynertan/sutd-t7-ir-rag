# Hydraulic motor having free wheeling and locking modes of operation.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid pressure device is provided of the type in which a valve spool 47 is axially movable within a spool bore 35 . In the normal operating position of the valve spool 47 , torque output is transmitted from the gerotor gear set 17 by means of a main drive shaft 53 through one spline connection 51, 49 then through a second spine connection 49, 75 to the output device. The valve spool 47 may be moved axially to a position in which the second spline connection 49, 75 is disengaged, and the device operates in a free wheel mode. The valve spool 47 may also be moved axially to a position in which a set of teeth 71 on the valve spool engage a set of teeth 69 on the stationary housing, such that the device operates in a lock mode.
