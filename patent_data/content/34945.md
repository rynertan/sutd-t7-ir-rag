Particularly preferred compounds according to the present invention are, referring to the identification by letters of the alphabet indicated above, Compound C. and more especially Compounds D toH, J to N and P to U and, in particular, Compound A. Accordingly, a feature of the present invention is a method for controlling the growth of weeds i.e. undesired vegetation at a locus which comprises applying to the locus a herbicidally effective amount of at least one N phenylpyrazole derivative of general formula III. For this purpose, the N phenylpyrazole derivatives are normally used in the form of herbicidal compositions i.e. in association with compatible diluents or carriers suitable for use in herbicidal compositions , for example as hereinafter described. The compounds of general formula III show herbicidal activity against dicotyledonous i.e. broadleafed and monocotyledonous e.g. grass weeds by pre and or post emergence application. By the term pre emergence application is meant application to the soil in which the weed seeds or seedlings are present before emergence of the weeds above the surface of the soil. By the term postemergence application is meant application to the aerial or exposed portions of the weeds which have emerged above the surface of the soil. For example.the compounds of general formula III may be used to control the growth of broad leafed weeds, for example.Aethusa cynapium, Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Amsinckia intermedia, Anaqallis arvensis,Anthemis arvensis, Atriplex patula, Bidens pilosa, Brassica nitro, Capsella bursa pastoris. Chenopodium album, Chrysanthemum seetumr Cirsium arvense. Datura stramonium, Desmodium tortuosum, Emex australis,Euphorbia helioscopia, Fumaria officinalis, Galeopsis tetrahit, Galium aparine, Geranium dissectum, Ipomea purpurea, Lamium purpureum, Lapsana communis, Matricaria inodora, Monochoria vaginalis, Papaver rhoeas, Physalis longifolia. Plantago lanceolata, Polygonum spp.. e.g. Polygonum aviculare, Polygonum convolvulus and Polyqonum persicaria , Portulaca oleracea, Raphanus raphanistrum, Rotala indica, Rumex obtusifolius,Saponaria vaccaria, Scandix pecten veneris, Senecio vulgaris, Sesbania florida, Sida spinosa, Silene alba. Sinapis arvensis, Solanum nigrum, Sonchus arvensis,Sperqula arvensis, Stellaria media, Thlaspi arvense,Tribulus terrestria, Urtica urens, Veronica hederifolia,Veronica persica, Viola arvensis and Xanthium strumarium, and grass weeds. for example. Alopecurus myosuroides,Apera spica venti, Aqrostis stolonifera, Avena fatua.Avena ludoviciana, Brachiaria spp., Bromus sterilis,Bromus tectorum, Cenchrus spp., Cynodon dactylon,Digitaria sanquinalis, Echinochloa crus qalli, Eleusine india, Setaria viridis and Sorqhum halepense and sedges, for example Cyprus esculentus, Cyperus iria and Cyperus rotundus, and Eleocharis acicularis. The amounts of compounds of general formula III applied vary with the nature of the weeds a the compositions used, the time of application, the climatic and edaphic conditions and when used to control the growth of weeds in crop growing areas the nature of the crops. When applied to a crop growing area, the rate of application should be sufficient to control the growth of weeds without causing substantial permanent damage to the crop.In general. taking these factors into account, application rates between 0.1 kg and 20 kg of active material per hectare give good results. However, it is to be understood that higher or lower application rates may be used, depending upon the particular problem of weed control encountered. The compounds of general formula III may be used to control selectively the growth of weeds, for example to control the growth of those species hereinbefore mentioned, by pre or post emergence application in a directional or non directional fashion, e.g. by directional or non directional spraying, to a locus of weed infestation which is an area used, or to be used, for growing crops, for example cereals, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, maize and rice, soya beans.field and dwarf beans, peas, lucerne, cotton, peanuts, flax, onions, carrots, cabbage, oilseed rape, sunflower, sugar beet, and permanent or sown grassland before or after sowing of the crop or before or after emergence of the crop. For the selective control of weeds at a locus of weed infestation which is an area used, or to be used, for the growing of crops e.g. the crops hereinbefore mentioned, application rates between 0.25 kg and 8.0 kg, and preferably between 0.5 kg and 2.0 kg, more especially of the preferred compounds of general formula III hereinbefore specified, of active material per hectare are particularly suitable.More particularly, the compounds of general formula III may be used to control selectively the growth of broad leafed weeds, for example to control the growth of those broad leafed species hereinbefore mentioned, by pre or, more especially. post emergence application in a non directional fashion, e.g. by non directional spraying, to an area used for growing cereal crops before or after emergence of both the crop and weeds. For this purpose, i.e. the selective control of broad leafed weeds by pre or post emergence application to an area used for growing cereal crops. application rates between 0.25 and 8.0 kg, and preferably between 0.5 kg and 2.0 kg, more especially of the preferred compounds of general formula III hereinbefore specified, of active material per hectare are particularly suitable. The compounds of general formula III may also be used to control the growth of weeds, especially those indicated above. by pre or post emergence application in established orchards and other treegrowing areas, for example forests. woods and parks, and plantations, e.g. sugar cane. oil palm and rubber plantations. For this purpose they may be applied in a directional or non directional fashion e.g. by directional or non directional spraying to the weeds or to the soil in which they are expected to appear.before or after planting of the trees or planatations at application rate between 0.25 kg and 10.0 kg.and preferably between 1.0 kg and 4.0 kg, more especially of the preferred compounds of general formula III hereinbefore specified. of active material per hectare. The compounds of general formula III may also be used to control the growth of weeds, especially those indicated above, at loci which are not crop growing areas but in which the control of weeds is nevertheless desirable. Examples of such non cropgrowing areas include airfields, industrial sites, railways, roadside verges, the verges of rivers, irrigation and other waterways, scrublands and fallow or uncultivated land, in particular where it is desired to control the growth of weeds in order to reduce fire risks. When used for such purposes in which a total herbicidal effect is frequently desired, the active compounds are normally applied at dosage rates higher than those used in crop growing areas as hereinbefore described. The precise dosage will depend upon the nature of the vegetation treated and the effect sought.Pre or post emergence application, and preferably pre emergence application, in a directional or non directional fashion e.g. by directional or non directional spraying at application rates between 5.0 kg and 20.0 kg, and preferably between 10.0 and 20.0 kg, more especially of the preferred compounds of general formula III hereinbefore specified, of active material per hectare are particularly suitable for this purpose. When used to control the growth of weeds by pre emegence application, the compounds of general formula III may be incorporated into the soil in which the weeds are expected to emerge. It will be appreciated that when the compounds of general formulaIII are used to control the growth of weeds by postemergence application, i.e. by application to the aerial or exposed portions of emerged weeds, the compounds of general formula III will also normally come into contact with the soil and may also then exercise a pre emergence control on later germinating weeds in the soil. Where especially prolonged weed control is required, the application of the compounds of general formula III may be repeated if required. According to a further feature of the present invention there are provided compositions suitable for herbicidal use comprising one or more of the N phenylpyrazole derivatives of general formula III in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in, one or more compatible herbicidally acceptable diluents or carriers tile. diluents or carriers of the type generally accepted in the art as being suitable for use in herbicidal compositions and which are compatible with compounds of general formula III . The term homogeneously dispersed is used to include compositions in which the compounds of general formula III are dissolved in the other components.The term Hherbicidal compositions is used in a broad sense to include not only compositions which are ready for use as herbicides but also concentrates which must be diluted before use. Preferably, the compositions contain from 0.05 to 90 by weight of one or more compounds of general formula III. The herbicidal compositions may contain both a diluent or carrier and a surface active e.g. wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent. Surface active agents which may be present in herbicidal compositions of the present invention may be of the ionic or nonionic types, for example sulphoricinoleates, quaternary ammonium derivatives, products based on condensates of ethylene oxide with nonyl or octylphenols, or carboxylic acid esters of anhydrosorbitols which have been rendered soluble by etherification of the free hydroxy groups by condensation with ethylene oxide, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of sulphuric acid esters and sulphonic acids such as dinonyl and dioctyl sodium sulphonosuccinates and alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of high molecular weight sulphonic acid derivatives such as sodium and calcium lignosulphonates. Suitably, herbicidal compositions according to the present invention may comprise from 0.0596 to 10 of surface active agent but, if desired, herbicidal compositions according to the present invention may comprise higher proportions of surface active agent, for example up to 15 in liquid emulsifiable suspension concentrates and up to 25 in liquid water soluble concentrates. Examples of suitable solid diluents or carriers are aluminium silicate, talc, calcined magnesia, kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork, adsorbent carbon black and clays such as kaolin and bentonite. The solid compositions which may take the form of dusts, granules or wettable powders are preferably prepared by grinding the compounds of general formula III with solid diluents or by impregnating the solid diluents or carriers with solutions of the compounds of general formula III in volatile solvents a evaporating the solvents and, if necessary, grinding the products so as to obtain powders. Granular formulations may be prepared by absorbing the compounds of general formula III dissolved in volatile solvents onto the solid diluents or carriers in granular form and evaporating the solvents, or by granulating compositions in powder form obtained as described above.Solid herbicidal compositions particularly wettable powders. may contain wetting or dispersing agent for example of the types described above a which may also, when solid. serve as diluents or carriers. Liquid compositions according to the invention may take the form Qf aqueous. organic or aqueous organic solutions. suspensions and emulsions which may incorporate a surface active agent. Suitable liquid diluents for incorporation in the liquid compositions include water, acetophenone, cyclohexanone, isophorone, toluene, xylene and mineral a animal and vegetable oils and mixtures of these diluents . Surface active agents.which may be present in the liquid compositions, may be ionic or non ionic for example of the types described above and may, when liquid1 also serve as diluents or carriers. Wettable powders and liquid compositions in the form of concentrates may be diluted with water or other suitable diluents. for example mineral or vegetable oils particularly in the case of liquid concentrates in which the diluent or carrier is an oil, to give compositions ready for use. when desired.liquid compositions of the compound of general formulaIII may be used in the form of self emulsifying concentrates containing the active substances dissolved in the emulsifying agents or in solvents containing emulsifying agents compatible with the active substances, the simple addition of water to such concentrates producing compositions ready for use. Liquid concentrates in which the diluent or carrier is ai oil may be used without further dilution using the electrostatic spray technique. Herbicidal compositions according to the present invention may also contain, if desired.conventional adjuvants such as adhesives, protective colloids thickeners, penetrating agents. stabilisers, sequestering agents. anti caking agents, colouring agents and corrosion inhibitors.

The reaction of a compound of general formula V with a compound of general formula VI may be effected in the presence of an inert organic solvent, for example an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g.ethanol , acetic acid or ethoxyethanol and at a temperature of from ambient temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and optionally in the presence of an alkali metal e.g. sodium or potassium , acetate, carbonate or bicarbonate. When an acid addition salt of the compound of general formula V is used. the reaction with the compound of general formula VI is effected in the presence of an alkali metal e.g.sodium or potassium acetate, carbonate or bicarbonate. N Phenylpyrazole derivatives of general formula III, wherein R5, R65 R75 R and 9 are as R10 hereinbefore defined and R10 represents a cyano radical, may. according to another feature of the present invention, be prepared by reaction of a compound of general formula V with a compound of general formula VI as hereinbefore described without isolation of an intermediate comppund of general formula IV from the reaction mixture.When the reaction of a compound of general formula V with a compound of general formula VI is effected in acetic acid, in the absence or presence of an alkali metal e.g. sodium or potassium acetate, the intermediate compound of formula IV may separate from the reaction mixture, depending upon the solubility of the intermediate compound of general formula IV in the reaction medium, and may, if desired, be isolated before being cyclised as hereinbefore described to a compound of general formula III, preferably by heating in an inert organic solvent e.g. ethoxyethanol at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Isolated compounds of general formula IV have been found to exhibit herbicidal activities similar to those of the corresponding N phenylpyrazole derivatives of general formula III into which they may be cyclised, and it is believed that the herbicidal activity of compounds of general formula IV results from their cyclisation to compounds of general formula III.

When R13 represents an alkoxy radical, reaction of a compound of general formula VIII with an amine of general formula IX is effected in an inert organic solvent e.g. ethanol at a temperature between the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and 2000C5 if nedessary at elevated pressure. Compounds of general formula VIII wherein R13 represents a chlorine atom may be prepared by the treatment of a compound of the general formula EMI49.1 wherein the various symbols are as hereinbefore defined with thionyl chloride, optionally in an inert organic solvent, e.g. toluene or chloroform.
