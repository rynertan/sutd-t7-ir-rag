# Electrical heating element.

## Abstract
An electrical tubular element with an outer, metallic casing 1 surrounding a resistor element 2 of a Fe Cr Al alloy embedded in an insulating material 3 , shows an improved life time. This is achieved by adding to the resistor alloy Y, Hf, Sc or one or more lanthanoids in an amount of 0.01 1 percent by weight.
