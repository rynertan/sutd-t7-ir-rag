# Containers having improved gas barrier properties.

## Abstract
The present invention provides polyesters and con tainers made therefrom having improved resistance to gas permeability. The containers are formed from a polyester resin which comprises the reaction product of a diol contain ing up to about 8 carbon atoms and a diacid component which comprises about 5 to 100 mole percent of a first diacid select ed from 1,4 phenylenedioxy diacetic acid, 1,3 phenylenedi oxy diacetic acid, 1,2 phenylenedioxy diacetic acid, and mix tures thereof, and 0 to about 95 mole percent of terephthalic acid. The containers which are provided by the present in vention may be in the form of sheet, film, molded articles, such as bottles, and other such structures.
