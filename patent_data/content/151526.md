## Description
This invention relates to an apparatus for soil stabilisation according to the preamble of patent claim 1. As is well known, soil stabilisation of soft soil strata has generally been performed by the injection of chemical grouting. However, injection of chemical grouting has drawbacks in that the chemicals may contaminate underground water and hence pollute public water supplies, and control of the chemical reaction is difficult, and thus the choice of chemicals is restricted. In view of the above, new soil stabilisation methods have recently been developed using powdery stabilising agents such as cement, quick lime or slug passed into the soft ground, mixing and agitating the same with the underground soil for solidification in situ. From the JP A 57 140417 an apparatus according to the preamble of the patent claim 1 is known having a mixing blade mounted on the end of a hollow drilling rod, whereby two radial portions of the mixing blade having a curvelinear cross section are disposed opposite each other. In order to supply a powdery stabilization agent in the form of an aerosol via a tube inside the hollow drilling rod to the ground, a distribution nozzle is disposed behind in the direction of rotation one of the mixing blade members. During operation of an apparatus for soil stabilization of this kind it has proved, that the stabilization agent tends to concentrate towards the radial end portions of the mixing blade. As a result, no homogenous stabilization conditions can be achieved. The invention has the underlying object of developing the generic prior art, so that a radial inhomogenous distribution of the stabilization agent in the ground is prevented. According to the application, this object is solved by the features of the characterizing portion of the new main claim. Providing at least one fin between the outer end of the mixing blade and the distribution nozzle permits a uniform distribution of the stabilization agent in radial direction of the mixing blade.

The entire ground improving system to which this invention is to be applied will be described in outline referring to Figure 1. In the drawing, ground level 1 is shown as three stages separated vertically from each other for the sake of the simplicity of the drawing. It should, however, be noted that the ground surface is actually continuous horizontally from the left uppermost stage to the right lowermost stage in the drawing. The drawing shows a mobile electric power generator 2, a control vehicle 3 mounting various types of control apparatus, recording apparatus and instruction apparatus although they are not shown in the drawing and a hopper 4 of a predetermined capacity. Cement 6 or other powdery stabilising agent is supplied at an optimal time interval from a tanker lorry 5 driven onto a ramp 7 adjacent the hopper 4. The cement 6 may alternatively be fed directly by means of a pipeline connected between a suitable cement delivery source and the hopper 4. A powder supply apparatus 8 disposed to one side of the hopper 4 is connected by means of hose 9 to a mobile rig 11 which is driven to the area 10 to be stabilised. A powder separation device 12 is disposed on the side of the rig 11. A suction pump 13 acting to suck the powder from the powder separation device 12 is connected to a cyclone 14, over which is further disposed a bag filter 15 as a powder filter means. The rig 11 may be a well known type crawler machine, in which a motor 17 and a pressure controlled type pinion rack or winch type elevating device 18 is disposed near the support at the upper end of a leader 16. Referring more specifically to the powder supply device 8, a set of hoppers 21 are each mounted by way of a load cell 23 to a support bracket 22 which is integrally connected to a stand 20 secured on a base 19 disposed on the surface of the ground level 1 as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. At the upper surface of each hopper 21 are disposed actuation cylinders 24 for pressurising powder charging valves upon closure and an exhaust valve 25 for adjusting the inner pressure of the hopper 21. Each hopper 21 is connected at its top by means of airtight bellows 26 to the hopper 4 so that cement 6 which acts as the powdery stabilising agent may be supplied by a screw feeder 27 from the hopper 4. An outlet cover 28 is disposed to the inside at the lower end of each hopper 21 so as to apply an effective pressure to the cement powder at a predetermined position relative to the rotation of a rotary feeder 29 connected to a motor. On the side of the rotary feeder 29, is disposed an exhaust port 30 for the cement, which is connected to the hose 9 by way of a pinch valve 31 which will rapidly interrupt the supply of the cement in an emergency. As shown in Figure 1, the hose 9 is connected by way of a swivel joint 33 to a rotary shaft 32. The shaft 32 is detachably and telescopically coupled to the motor 17 disposed at the top end of the rig 11. A mixing blade 34 is secured at the lowermost end of the rotary shaft 32. As shown in Figure 1, the rotary shaft 32 with the mixing blade 34 is adapted to be inserted into a column 35 in the soft ground 1 which has been previously drilled and the blade 34 is rotated to uniformly mix the cement material with the soil 36 so that the mixed material solidifies with the elapse of time to provide a stabilised soil 37. Returning then to the rotary shaft 32 and the mixing blade 34 illustrated in Figure 4 onwards, the mixing blade 34 is attached to and extends in the diametrical direction from the lower end of the rotary shaft 32. The mixing blade 34 has a curved cross section and the shape of the curve is reversed on each side of the rotary shaft 32 so that the mixing blade 34 has a convex cross sectional profile facing the forward direction of rotation of the rotary shaft 32 shown by the curved arrow in Figure 4. A row of small fingers 39 are formed integrally at the lower edge of the blade so that mixing can be effected readily and effectively. As shown in Fig. 7, a transportation tube 40 is formed coaxially inside the rotary shaft 32 and opens at a nozzle 41 at the inner end of the mixing blade 34, so that cement or the like pneumatically transported as described above may be jetted out together with air as the carrier gas along the mixing blade 34 and on the concave side thereof. The pneumatically transported cement is jetted out from the nozzle 41 behind the rotary shaft 32 as it rotates it enters the soil 36 in a region in which the the pressure of the soil 36 is relatively low. In use, when the rotary shaft 32 is being inserted downwardly into the ground 1, only the compressed air is jetted out from the transportation tube 40 to the nozzle 41 to thereby facilitate the insertion of the mixing blade 34 into the ground. On the other hand, when the rotary shaft 32 is being lifted, pneumatically transported cement is jetted out through the nozzle 41 and is uniformly mixed and agitated with the previously pulverised and agitated soil 31 into a mixed layer 37. Then with the elapse of time the cement mixed with the soil 36 reacts with the water content in the soil to thereby solidify and improve the soft soil stratum. During insertion and extraction of the rotary shaft 32 into and out of the ground, slight gaps are formed between the rotary shaft 32 and the ground or the soil because the stroking movement of the shaft is not always linear. This advantageously forms a passage for the compressed air and facilitates the insertion and the extraction of the rotary shaft 32. Although the illustrated rotary shaft 32 has a circular cross section, an exhaust guide 42 of a predetermined width and height may be formed integrally to the circumference of the rotary shaft 32 and extend as far as the upper surface of the rotary blade 34 as shown in a modified embodiment of Figure 4. A hollow portion bore is formed in the soil by the exhaust guide 42 upon rotation of the rotary shaft 32 to ensure the formation of an upward passage so that the compressed air can escape to ground level. Alternatively, the rotary shaft 32 may be formed as a square cross section as shown in the embodiment of Figure 5 so that the corners 32 of the square cross section form a hollow portion above the blade upon rotation of the rotary shaft 32, which similarly functions as the exhaust passage for the compressed air. As shown in Figure 6, where the rotary shaft 32 reaches ground level 1, it passes through a hood 46. The hood extends between a bracket 44 mounting a guide 43 and the ground 1 by way of a rubber collar 45. The vertical movement and rotation of the rotary shaft 32 is compensated by means of a ball bearing 47. The compressed air which still contains a small amount of cement rises up through the gap formed by the guide 42, is discharged into the hood 46, is sucked from an exhaust port 48 of the hood 46 to the suction pump 13 and then sent by means of a hose 49 to the cyclone 14 of the powder separation device 12 as described above. There, the cement is separated from the air and collected in the cement box 50 therebelow, while the cleaned air is discharged into the atmosphere through the filter disposed above the powder separation device 12. Thus, during the lifting of the rotary shaft 32 relative to the hood 46, the compressed air carrier gas and or cement are not directly discharged to the atmosphere but the air is discharged after being separated from the powder in the hood 46 and the cyclone 14, whereby there is no danger of contaminating the working environment or surrounding environment. Important factors for the soil stabilisation by powder jetting and mixing comprise passing the rotary shaft 32 into and out of the ground, preventing the environmental contamination with the powder and the mixing and agitation of the powder with the soil 36 in the ground 1. Since the former two factors have already been explained, admixture and agitation of the powder with the soil 36 will now be described. At first, it should be noted that if the resistance to the rotation of the rotary shaft 32 and blade 34 caused by the soil or the like varies upon insertion into and lifting out of the ground 1, the speed of insertion or lifting is changed and the amount of cement supplied is varied to suit the speed. If the amount of cement supplied fluctuates, it changes the density of the powdery cement depending on the height of the soil 36 to result in the variation in the solidification rate failing to obtain uniform soil stabilisation. In view of the above, in one embodiment according to this invention, an inner tube 51 see Figure 7 for the cement is formed inside the rotary shaft 32 and the tube 51 opens into a nozzle 41 at the base of the mixing blade 34. The annular gap 52 formed between the inner tube 51 and the outer wall of the rotary shaft 32 is used as a passage for feeding compressed air alone and a predetermined number of gas exhaust holes 53, are provided on the outer wall of the rotary shaft 32. In this embodiment, compressed air can be sent through the annular gap 52 and discharged from the exhaust holes 53, to allow the compressed air to pass up through the gap 84 between the rotary shaft 32 and the ground 1, whereby insertion and lifting of the rotary shaft 32 and the mixing blade 34 can be facilitated and the vertical velocity thereof can be maintained as constant as possible. Therefore, the rate of compressed air carrier gas and the cement powder supplied is always kept constant and mixing and agitation of cement agent with the soil can be kept uniform, while the separated air can be discharged above the ground together with the rising air stream from the exhaust holes 53, through the gap 84. This embodiment also comprises guide means not shown in Fig. 7 interposed between the outer end of the mixing blade member 34 and the distribution nozzle 41. Further, a fin 54 may desirably be disposed at the outer end of the mixing blade 34 as shown in Figure 7 by which the area of soil mixed and agitated with the pneumatically transported cement powder can be closely defined. Accordingly, in this modified embodiment, the extent of the area to be stabilised and the overlap between different areas stabilised by successive operations can be prdetermined to enable more accurate and effective soil stabilisation. In the case where the distance through which the cement powder must be transported is larger, for example, where the soil stabilisation is carried out in an extremely deep stratum, the pressure for penumatically transporting the cement powder has to be increased. In such a case, although the pressure for the pneumatic transportation can properly be controlled by the control device of the control vehicle 3, for instance, in accordance with the lifting of the rotary shaft 32, since the cement powder is jetted out from the nozzle 41 at the extreme end of the rotary shaft 32 at a high pressure, the powder may not be distributed uniformly, that is, it may be concentrated more toward the fin 54 end of the mixing blade 34. In such a case, another fin 54 may be disposed towards the middle of the length of the mixing blade 34 as shown in Figure 9. In the embodiment shown in Figure 9, the cross sectional shape of the mixing blade 34 is modified with respect to the fin 54 as illustrated in Figure 10 or Figure 11. The undesirable localised distribution of the cement powder as described above is increased as the size of the mixing blade 34 and the rotary shaft 32 increases. In this case, a further modified embodiment as shown in Figure 12 can be employed, in which there are a plurality of fins 54 , 54 , 54 , the height of the fins gradually increasing from fin to fin along the longitudinal direction of the mixing blade 34 toward the outer end of the blade. The cross sectional shape of the mixing blade 34 may be different in this case also to take into account the fins 54 , 54 , 54 as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. In a further modified embodiment shown in Figure 15, apertures 55 are formed in each of the fins 54 , 54 , 54 for passing the powder stream to thereby more uniformly distribute the pneumatically transported cement powder in the rotational region of the mixing blade 34. In the embodiment shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17, the nozzle 41 does not exit on the axis of the blade 34 but is positioned somewhat in advance thereof in the rotational direction of the shaft. Further, a guide plate 56 is disposed along the axis of the mixing blade 34 and a shaped guide 57 is disposed before the fin 54 so as to form a deflected path 58. Thus the cement powder pneumatically transported and jetted out from the nozzle 41 passes just behind the mixing blade and is mixed and agitated with the soil 36 immediately behind the blade while avoiding the undesirable effect of the soil pressure on the rotation of the mixing blade in the direction of the arrow. As shown in Figure 18 through Figure 21, various configurations of the guide plate 56 and mixing blade 34 may be used as required. As described above, it is a fundamental feature of this apparatus to pneumatically transport cement or other powdery stabilising agent through the transportation tube 40 in the rotary shaft 32, jet out the powder from the nozzle 41 disposed at the base of the mixing blade 34 and then mix and agitate the cement with the soil 36 so it is uniformly stabilised, in which a greater weight of pneumatically transported cement powder is distributed and remains within the soil while the compressed air carrier gas is separated therefrom and rises up through the soil in the gap behind the mixing blade during rotation. In the embodiment, shown in Figure 22, the transportation tube 40 formed inside the rotary shaft 32 diverts out of the shaft 32 at the point 57 situated above the mixing blade 34 and is connected with an exposed transportation tube 40 . The carrier compressed air jetted out towards the inner end of the mixing blade 34 can pass through the hollow portion formed at the back of the rotating exposed transportation tube 40 , and through the gap between the ground 1 and the rotary shaft 32 which may be formed by the protruding guide 42 and is then discharged above the ground. As shown in Figure 22 and Figure 23, the exposed transportation tube 40 may be opened into a nozzle 41 on the upper surface mid way along the mixing blade 34 and a pair of guide plates 59, 59 extending outwardly may be disposed to the inside of the mixing blade 34 just below the nozzle 41 to uniformly distribute the pneumatically transported cement powder over the region of rotation of the mixing blade 34 depending on the size and the angle of the guide plates 59, 59. In addition to the mixing blade 34 used in each of the foregoing embodiments, a screw auger may be mounted on the rotary shaft 32 above the mixing blade 34. In Figure 24, a recess 42 is provided in the outer wall of the rotary shaft 32 as an exhaust guide and is connected to a communication hole not shown formed through the base end of the mixing blade 34. Accordingly, in this embodiment, mixing and agitation can be effected uniformly not only in the radial direction of the mixing blade 34 but also in the vertical direction by means of the screw auger through control of the speed of lifting and lowering of the rotary shaft 32, whereby the powdery cement agent and the soil 36 can be made more homogenous. In use of the apparatus described, a bore hole of the same diameter as the mixing blade 34 is drilled into the ground 1 by an appropriate drilling or excavating device to primarily pulverise the soil 36 in the shaft hole and, thereafter, the rotary shaft 32 equipped with the mixing blade 34 is driven downwardly. It is then lifted upwardly while pneumatically transporting and injecting cement powder which is mixed and agitated with the soil 36 as decribed above. However, as the mixing blade 34 is being lifted upwardly from the lowermost end in the column 35, since the guide at the top end of the rotary shaft 32 abuts against the bottom of the shaft 35, there is the disadvantage that the mixing and agittion of the pneumatically transported cement powder with the soil 36 can not be effected above a certain height from the bottom. In order to overcome such a disadvantage, in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 25, an inner tube 51 is mounted as the transportation tube 40 by means of a bracket 61 inside the rotary shaft 32 so as to provide an annular gap 52 as with the embodiment shown in Figure 7. The inner tube 51 is adapted to be in communication with the two nozzles 41, 41 the two mixing blades 34, disposed at two positions of different height near the bottom end of the rotary shaft 32, the nozzles being connected to pipes 62, so that the carrier gas and the cement powder can pass to the nozzles 41 and 41, respectively. A sleeve pipe 63 is disposed slidably by way of a seal member 64 to the inside of the inner tube 51 and a head 65 at the lower end thereof is sealed by means of a seal member 66 surrounding the outer side of the lower end of the inner tube 51. A compression spring 67 is disposed vertically between the lower end 65 and the lower end of the inner tube 51, so that the sleeve pipe 63 may be lifted by the soil pressure relatively to the inside of the inner tube 51 during downward insertion of the rotary shaft 32 into the ground 1 whereby the lower nozzle 68 communicates with the nozzle 41 of the mixing blade 34 at the lower stage while the upper nozzle 68 is cut off from the nozzle 41 of the mixing blade 34. Accordingly, during downward insertion of the rotary shaft 32 into the ground 1, compressed air is jetted out through the annular gap 52 between the inner tube 51 and the rotary shaft 32 from the exhaust hole 53 to facilitate the insertion. Then, when the rotary shaft 32 reaches a predetermined depth, cement powder is transported pneumatically. Since the spring 67 is still compressed by the soil pressure against the head 65, the lower nozzle 68 is in communication with the nozzle 41 and cement material is jetted out together with the carrier gas into the soil 36 during the rotation of the rotary shaft 32 and mixed and agitated as described above. When the rotary shaft 32 is lifted, since the soil pressure against the sleeve pipe 63 is decreased, the sleeve pipe 63 moves down relatively to the inner tube 51 under the action of the spring 67, so that communication between the lower nozzle 68 and the nozzle 41 of the mixing blade 34 is interrupted while the upper nozzle 68 moves into communication with the nozzle 41 of the mixing blade 34 to jet out the cement powder adjacent the upper mixing blade 34 which is then mixed and agitated with the soil 36 in the same manner as in each of the foregoing embodiments. Accordingly, soil 36 in the previously drilled column 35 can be stabilised substantially over the entire depth according to this embodiment. Furthermore, although the mixing blade 34 shown in each of the foregoing embodiments is of a fixed structure, if the energy of jetting out the pneumatically transported cement from the nozzle 41 is large in relation with the pressure of the soil 36, the cement material may be scattered beyond the rotational range of the mixing blade 34. In such a case it is desirable to make the mixing blade extendable and reducable in length to attain the optimum mixing and agitation for the powdery cement. Such an embodiment is illustrated in Figure 26, wherein a sleeve 71 formed with a female thread 70 is engaged with the rotary shaft 32 by means of male threads 69 formed around a predetermined position of the rotary shaft 32, and a boss 72 is rotatably disposed at the lowermost end of the rotary shaft 32. Mixing blades 73, 74 are hinged between the boss 72 and a sleeve 71. In this embodiment, when the rotary shaft 32 is rotated in one direction during insertion of the rotary shaft 32 into the ground 1, the sleeve 71 is moved upwardly to reduce the lateral extension of the mixing blades 73, 74 by pulling them up towards a position parallel with the rotary shaft 32. On the other hand, as the rotary shaft 32 is lifted, the shaft 32 is rotated in the opposite direction to lower the sleeve 71 thereby expanding the mixing blades 73, 74 laterally so that the cement powder may be mixed efficiently with the soil 36 by the mixing blade 34. In this embodiment, the compressed carrier gas jetted out from the nozzle 41 can be exhausted along each of the mixing blades 73, 74 which thereby form exhaust guides. While the sleeve 71 is disposed above the mixing blade 34 in this embodiment, the sleeve 71 may be disposed below a further mixing blade 34 in another embodiment as illustrated in Figure 27. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the modes of practicing this invention are no way limited only to the foregoing embodiments but various other embodiments are possible and are also within the scope of this invention. For instance, other kinds of powdery stabilising agent such as slug or quick lime may be employed in addition to or as an alternative to the powdery cement. Further, since the air used as the transportation means escapes through the gap between the ground and the rotary shaft to ground level, it does not cause gas bubbles within the ground and satisfactory solidification and soil stabilisation is attained. Further, the carrier air released above the ground is separated and filtered from the cement or like other powdery stabilising agent in the powder separation device and the air removed from the powdery stabilising agent through filtration so that it can be discharged in a cleaned state to the atmosphere. Thus there is no risk of contaminating the working environment or polluting any residentail area in the neighbourhood.
