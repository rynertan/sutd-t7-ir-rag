## Description
The present invention relates to a color video camera, especially a color video camera having a high sensitivity. Recently, color video cameras using solid state image pickup devices having a two dimensional array of photo electric elements have become popular as a result of the popularization of video cassette recorders VCRs . It is well known that a complimentary filter for transmitting colors cyan Cy , yellow Ye or magenta Ma , is utilized as a color filter in the color video camera to increase the sensitivity of color video cameras using solid state photo sensitive devices. For example, such filters are described in Nabeyama et al. All solid state color camera with single chip MOS imager IEEE Tr. on CE, Vol. CE. 27 Feb., 1981 , Ohba et al. MOS Imaging Random Noise Suppression ISSCC Digest, P26 Feb., 1984 , or Sato et al. U. S. Patent 4,246,601 issued on Jan. 20, 1981 . In the prior art document GB A 2 085 258 a signal processing circuit for a color video camera is revealed. An image of an object is focused into a plurality of light sensitive elements e.g. photodiodes to a plurality of optical color filters which are in color complementing relationship. A color signal is taken out in terms of luminance signal, a red color signal and a blue color signal through photo electric conversion means. A green color signal is prepared on the basis of the red color signal, the blue color signal and the luminance signal. Gamma correction is made on the green, red and blue color signals. A luminance signal is reconstructed on the basis of the green, red and blue color signals which have undergone the gamma correction. The color video signal thus obtained reproduces an image of the object with correct hues and saturations. If red R , green G and blue B are considered to be three primary colors, Cy is a complimentary color to R, that is, R and Cy are mixed to form white W . Ma and Ye are the complimentary colors to G and B, respectively. The complimentary filter described in this specification can be a separate color filter element for transitting each of the colors Cy, Ye, and Ma, or a color filter comprising the separate color filter elments. Also, in this specifiaction, a primary color filter can be a separate color filter element for transmitting each of the colors R, G and B, or a color filter comprising the separate color filter elements. When a complimentary filter is utilized, the luminance S N ratio becomes about 6 dB higher than when a primary color filter is used. The cause Will be described hereinafter. Fig. 1a illustrates an explanatory view showing the arrangement of the primary color filter as the color filter of the color video camera, and Fig. 1b similarly illustrates the arrangement of the complimentary filter. In this Figure, G, R, B, W, Cy and Ye respectively denote green, red, blue, transparent white , cyan and yellow color filters, and also denote image signals for one picture element. A luminance signal y Similar to the above, a luminance signal y Moreover, there is no need to repeatedly indicate that the W filter can pass R, G and B and that the C Comparing formula 1 with 2 , it is evident that the received image signal quantity can be doubled when complimentary filters are employed. When the complimentary filter arrangement indicated in Fig. 1b is employed, a red channel signal r Similarly, a blue channel signal B In the primary color filter arrangement indicated in Fig. 1a, a red channel signal r These formulas 5 and 6 indicate that the signal quantity of the color channel signals can be doubled when complimentary filters are employed, compared with employing primary color filters. Next, the noise for each color channel will be studied. Fig 2 illustrates a schematic explanatory view showing random noise in the four filters, more exactly, corresponding to the four picture elements. In the case of the previously cited prior art of Nabeyama et al., each of the four color filters provides an independent readout signal when converting the image transmitted through the color filters into an electrical signal and then it is read as the amplitude of the electric charge. Thus, there is no relation among the noise signals n1 to n4 in the respective filters. When employing the complimentary filters shown in Fig. 1b as the color filter, a random noise n It is evident that these formulas 7 to 9 can be derived by referring to the above stated formulas 2 to 4 . Next, in the case of employing a complimentary filter such as indicated in Fig. 1b as the color filter, random noise n As indicated above, it is evident that random noise in the color channel signal is doubled, that is, its power is quadrupled, when employing the complimentary filter compared with employing the primary color filter. Considering that the signal strength is doubled by employing a complimentary filter, S N ratios are improved to 6dB in the luminance signal and 0dB in the color channel signals by the complimentary filter. The improvement of the color S N ratios in the color video camera utilizing the complimentary filter is deemed to be effectual in improving the sensitivity of the camera. Next, we will consider the case where there is a relationship between the random noise values in the filters, that is, the picture elements. The above mentioned prior art by Ohba et al. is designed to use a common read out signal, that is, one signal line extending vertically used for two vertically adjacent picture elements of a two dimensional array of picture elements, that is, photo electric elements, for example, W and C The signals corresponding to Fig. 3 schematically show the correlation. In Fig. 3, n1 denotes the noise on the vertical signal line caused after unnecessary signals such as vertical smear signals are swept away from the vertical signal line to the outside, prior to reading out the signal W, n2 denotes the noise on the vertical signal line caused after the signal W was transferred to the horizontal transfer section, n3 denotes the noise on the vertical signal line caused after the signal Cy was transferred to the horizontal transfer section, and n4 to n6 denote the noise on a next vertical signal line, corresponding to G and Ye, respectively. In this instance, as indicated in Fig. 3, the noise of W and Cy is n1 n2 and n2 n3 , respectively, and the correlation between them is established. The random noise for respective signals is given by the following formulas Thus, it is understood that the noise n Camera sensitivity can be improved by improvement of the S N ratio of the red channel signal in the color filter arrangement indicated in Fig. 1b. If Cy is replaced with Y As mentioned above, in a color video camera using a solid state image pick up device, it will be effective to improve the S N ratio of the red channel signal in order to increase the sensitivity. For that purpose, an infrared cut off filter having a higher cut off characteristic than the prior art can be used. However, that would raise another problem mentioned hereinafter. Fig. 4 shows a graph of spectral sensitivity of the solid state image pick up elements formed on a silicon Si chip. This graph is a large scale linear approximation for simplification. The data is measured by attaching the solid state image pick up elements MOS transistor type used in the aforementioned prior art to the complimentary filter indicated in Fig. 1b and then using a 3200 K halogen lamp and a beryl filter. In this graph, the absciss denotes wavelength and the ordinate denotes relative sensitivity. In this Figure, the real line denotes the sensitivity corresponding to W and the dotted line denotes the sensitivity corresponding to G. The characteristic traced by the dotted line on the left and the solid line on the right denotes the sensitivity corresponding to Ye. The characteristic traced by the solid line on the left and the dotted line on the right denotes the sensitivity corresponding to Cy. The spectral sensitivity characteristics of the luminance signal y, the red channel signal r, and the blue channel signal b can be obtained by substituting the spectral sensitivity characteristics indicated in Fig. 4 into the above mentioned formulas 2 to 4 . The result obtained thereby is shown in Fig. 5. In this Figure, the sensitivity corresponding to y is denoted by a solid line the sensitivity corresponding to r is denoted by a dotted line on the left and a solid line on the right the sensitivity corresponding to b is denoted by a solid line on the left and a dotted line on the right. In the conventional prior art, the spectral sensitivity characteristics of y, r and b, which correspond approximately to the standard color specification system defined by CIE Commission Internationale de l, Echairage International Commission of Illumination , is obtained by cutting off the wavelength ofλ The examples of spectral sensitivity characteristics including conventional near infrared cut off filters are described in Takemura et al. CCD 2 plate style color television camera TV Scientific Society of Japan, Vol. 33, Section 7, page 28 1979 . Also, in the prior art, for example, T. Inai et al., USP 4,437,111 issued on March 13, 1984 , a color video camera using a pick up tube and an infrared cut off filter is disclosed. Therefore, it is clear that to increase the sensitivity of the color video camera, especially the one using the solid state image pick up device, the S N ratio of the red channel signal must be improved by using an infrared cut off filter having a higher cut off frequency. But it is clear that the spectral sensitivity of the color video camera will deviate from the standard color specification system defined by CIE when the S N ratio of the red channel signal is thus improved. It is an object of the present invention to provide a color video camera having a high sensitivity and red channel signal with a high S N ratio. The above object is attained by a color video camera according to claim 1. The color video camera comprises means for picking up an image to provide a plurality of color image signals in response to a picked up image, means connected to said pick up means including a matrix circuit for generating a first luminance signal, a second luminance signal and color channel signals by combining said plurality of color image signals supplied to said matrix circuit, said matrix circuit using matrix coefficients for producing said first and second luminance signal, said matrix coefficients for producing said second luminance signal being different from said matrix coefficients for producing said first luminance signal, means connected to said generating means for processing said second luminance signals and said color channel signals to provide color difference signals and for passing said first luminance signal, and means connected to said processing means for producing a color video signal in accordance with said first luminance signal and said color difference signals. Further, the color video camera of the present invention comprises means for filtering an image. As the filtering means, an infrared light cut off filter for cutting off near infrared light of the image above λc is provided, λc being set in the range of 670 nm to 780 nm. The cut off wavelength λc is determined by a wavelength at which the permeability becomes 0.5. With regard to the matrix coefficients for generating the second luminance signal, the matrix coefficients for producing the portion of the second luminance signal related to a red component are less than the matrix coefficients for producing of the second luminance signal to reduce the red component of the second luminance signal. In the present invention, preferably, the red color difference signal below a predetermined value is extracted and the extracted red color difference signal is added to the first luminance signal to reduce the red component of the first luminance signal. The present invention is effective in color video cameras using a solid state image pick up device, especially those having a complimentary filter, for example, the one constructed with a white filter, a cyan filter, a green filter and a yellow filter. The infrared light cut off filter is made of a multilayer vacuum deposited film. Concerning the cut off frequency of the infrared light cut off filter, in principle the wavelength λc can be increased up to 780 nm which is the border of visible light. The embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing one embodiment color video camera of the present invention. In this Figure, 1 denotes a lens and its mirror casing, 2 denotes a near infrared cut off filter with a cut off wavelength of 700nm, 3 denotes image pick up elements which utilize MOS transistor type elements such as indicated in the prior art by Ohba et al. The numeral 4 denotes a color sampling generating circuit, including a matrix circuit, for generating a luminance signal y, a low band luminance signal y Figs. 7 to 9 show the details of respective blocks shown in the numerals 4 to 6 of Fig. 6. In those figures, a pulse generating circuit such as a synchronous signal circuit, an image pick up driving circuit or the like, an iris control circuit and the like are omitted for simplification, because these circuits are not directly related to the flow of signals. Fig. 7 is a block diagram showing one embodiment of the color sampling generating circuit 4 indicated in Fig. 6. In this Figure, 8 denotes a signal input terminal to which each signal of W, C The numeral 41 denotes a preamplifier, 42 denotes a sampling circuit for separating the input signal into W, C Also, it is clear that a₁₁ to a₄₄ are predetermined matrix coefficients. Then, these signals are passed through a low pass filter 45 to respective output terminals 9 to 12. Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the processing circuit 5. In this Figure, 13 to 16 denote signal input terminals, respectively, 51 denotes a DC restorer, 52 denotes a white balancing amplifier. 53 denotes a γ correcting amplifier, 54 denotes a blanking circuit, 55 denotes a color difference signal generator, 56 denotes a AGC amplifier, 57 denotes a detection circuit, and 17 to 19 denote output terminals of the luminance signal and the color difference singals, respectively. The DC restorer 51 often employs a model by sampling a standard black level signal such as the optical black, etc. at the output of the γ correcting amplifier 53 and then feeding back the signal thereof. However, the feedback line is omitted. To lessen color reproduction error as much as possible, it is better to utilize a model as the γ correcting amplifier of the low band luminance signal y Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the encoder 6. In this Figure, 20 to 22 denote signal input terminals, 61 denotes a DC restorer, 62 denotes a blanking circuit, 63 denotes a white clipping circuit, and 64 denotes a color modulator for modulating the frequency of the color difference signal and then locking it on the color sub carrier. Also, a burst signal is generated. The numeral 65 denotes a band pass filter for the color sub carrier and 66 denotes a delay line for one horizontal scanning period, 1H delay line, which utilizes a glass delay line or the like. The delay line 66 and an adder 67 compose a tandem compound filter for reducing color noise by narrowing a vertical color band. The adder circuit 68 serves to add the luminance signal y to the color sub carrier and the resulting signal is passed through a synchronous signal adder circuit 69 and an output amplifier 60 and then the desired color video signal is ouput at an output terminal 7. In the embodiment described above, the distinguishing feature is that the first luminance signal y and the second luminance signal, that is, the low band luminance signal y This enlargement compensates so as not to make the color reproduction inferior even if the cut off wavelength λc of the near infrared cut off filter is enlarged. Since enlarging λc increases the red components, the coefficients a₂₁, a₂₄ are decreased so as to reduce the red components. In the signal y Similarly with the low band luminance signal y Fig. 10 shows an example of changing the spectral sensitivity characteristics of the luminance signal when changing a luminance signal generating matrix. This example is calculated on the basis of the spectral sensitivity shown in Fig. 4 when the cut off wavelength is 700nm. y₁ denotes the case that all the matrix coefficients are 1 as indicated in said formula 2 . y₂ satisfies formula 17 and the matrix coefficients are The proportion of the red components in y₂ are reduced in comparison with y₁. In y₃ the proportion of the red component has been reduced and the matrix coefficients are shown as follows As one example, y₂ is a luminance signal y and y₃ is a luminance signal for generating a color difference signal y Note that there exist matrix coefficients having a higher S N ratio than those shown in the formula 19 so as to obtain the spectral sensitivity characteristic as shown in y₃ of Fig. 10. As described above, it is possible to freely arrange matrix luminance signal coefficients for generating the color difference signal y Consequently, the red object is reproduced at an unnaturally luminous intensity. It is necessary to provide a means to reduce the luminance level of the red object to cope with this problem. A concrete example of this means is shown in Fig. 11. The waveform pattern of the operation of the circuit is shown in Figs. 12a to 12d, and is based on the assumption of arranging blue, green and red objects against a black background in left to right order. The circuit shown in Fig. 11 reduces the amplitude of the first luminance signal y supplied to the terminal 17 by the amount that the red color difference signal y In Fig. 11, 81 to 83 denote transistors, respectively, 84 denotes a capacitor, 85 to 90 denote resistors, and 23 denotes a power source terminal. The transistors 81 and 82 and the capacitor 84 construct a clipping circuit for clipping the red color difference signal y In this embodiment, if an object in the picture is dark, it is impossible to improve the picture quality of the dark object. However, the human eye does not detect any unnaturalness of the dark object in the picture when an unimproved red object is present. It is better to distinguish the lighter red object than to be able to correct the dark object so no disadvantage results from not being able to correct a dark object. As described above, the present invention can improve the sensitivity of a color video camera by enlarging the S N ratio of the red signal without causing inferior color reproduction and luminance reproduction. If the present invention is applied to image pick up elements using solid state image pick up devices and λc is 700 nm, it is possible to increase the S N ratio of the red signal by 5.5 dB at 3200 K, a point higher than that of the conventional value λc 650nm.
