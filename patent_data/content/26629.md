## Abstract
Beryllium ions are implanted into a germanium substrate. The carrier concentration profile is shown grapically in Figure 4A. The substrate is heat treated at a temperature in the range from 400 C to 700 C to diffuse beryllium into the substrate. A surface concentration of beryllium of 10¹⁷ cm ³ or more can be obtained. The relatively low temperature of heat treatment avoids adverse effects on the substrate. Deep diffusions of beryllium can be obtained. p type guard rings, p type channel stoppers and p type islands can be formed.
