# Device for displaying digital information incorporating selection of picture pages and or resolution enhancement.

## Abstract
Digital information is usually displayed as a set of pixels which are arranged according to a line pattern within a two dimensional area. For the storage of the information to be displayed, use is normally made of a picture memory. The content of an information pixel is stored in the memory as m bits m 1 . When use is made of a colour map memory, the information can be displayed in different colours to be selected by a user. Selective display of the information is also possible, which means that only a selected number of the m bits are displayed. The invention provides a device for the display of digital information which enables selective display. In order to realize selective display, a device in accordance with the invention comprises a gate circuit with a control input on at least one connection between the display memory and the colour map memory. Selective display in the form of picture pages and resolution enhancement is made possible by selected control signals on said control input.
