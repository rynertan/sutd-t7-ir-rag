## Description
TITLE IMPACT RESISTANT POLYOXYMETHYLENE COMPOSITIONS DESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to certain polyoxymethylene compositions which are characterized by extraordinary impact resistance. Polyoxymethylene compositions are generally understood to include compositions based on homopolymers of formaldehyde or of cyclic oligomers of formaldehyde, for example trioxane, the terminal groups of which are end capped by esterification or etherification, as well as copolymers of formaldehyde or of cyclic oligomers of formaldehyde, with oxyalkylene groups with at least two adjacent carbon atoms in the main chain, the terminal groups of which copolymers can be hydroxyl terminated or can be end capped by esterification or etherification. The proportion of the comonomers can be up to 20 weight percent.Compositions based on polyoxymethylene of relatively high molecular weight, i.e. 20,000 to 100,000 are useful in preparing semi finished and finished articles by any of the techniques commonly used with thermoplastic materials, e.g. compression molding, injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, rotational molding, melt spinning, stamping and thermoforming. Finished products made from such compositions possess extremely desirable physical properties, including high stiffness, strength, chemical stability and solvent resistance. However, in certain applications, it would be desirable to have greater impact resistance than has heretofore been possible with conventional polyoxymethylene compositions. Background Art U.S. Patent 2,993,025, granted July 18, 1961 to Alsup et al U.S. Patent 3,027,352, grantedMarch 27, 1962 to Walling et al U.S. Patent 3,743,614, granted July 3, 1973 to Wolters et al U.S. Patent 3,787,353, granted January 22, 1974 toIshii et al U.S. Patent 3,960,984, granted June 1, 1976 to Kohan and U.S. Patent 4,098,843, grantedJuly 4, 1978 to Johnson, all disclose various polyoxymethylene compositions, both those based on homopolymers and those based on copolymers and various techniques for stabilizing such compositions.

Thermoplastic polyurethanes are not mentioned. Other examples of various additives, other than thermoplastic polyurethanes, for improving the impact resistance of polyoxymethylene compositions are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,975,459, grantedAugust 17, 1976 and U.S. Patent 4,017,558, grantedApril 12, 1977, both to Schmidt et al JapanesePatent Publication 48 15,954, published February 28, 1973 and Japanese Patent Publication 52 019,752, published February 15, 1977. None of the references discussed or listed above report the extraordinary impact resistance which can be achieved by the techniques of the present invention.Disclosure of the Invention This invention relates to certain polyoxymethylene compositions which are characterized by extraordinary impact resistance. The term polyoxymethylene as used herein includes homopolymers of formaldehyde or of cyclic oligomers of formaldehyde, the terminal groups of which are end capped by esterification or etherification, and copolymers of formaldehyde or of cyclic oligomers of formaldehyde with oxyalkylene groups with at least two adjacent carbon atoms in the main chain, the terminal groups of which copolymers can be hydroxyl terminated or can be end capped by esterification or etherification. It has been found that certain polyoxymethylenes can be formulated into compositions with extraordinary impact resistance far in excess of any degree of impact resistance that has been previously achieved with such polyoxymethylenes.More specifically, when certain polyoxymethylenes having high molecular weights are melt compounded with certain thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers having low glass transition temperatures, such that the proportion of thermoplastic elastomer is 5 158 by weight, and further such that the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer is intimately mixed with and dispersed as discrete particles throughout the polyoxymethylene, the resulting compositions are characterized by extraordinary impact resistance as measured in a standard Gardner impact test ASTMD 3029, Method G, Geometry D using a 3.6 kg 81b weight and injection molded 7.62 x 12.7 x 0.16 cm 3 x 5 x 1 16 plagues.The polyoxymethylene compositions of the present invention will be characterized by a Gardner impact value of greater than 9 J 80 in lb , preferably greater than 17 J 150 in lb , and in the most preferred cases greater than 25 J 225 in lb . This can be contrasted with unmodified polyoxymethylene, which will show aGardner impact value of about 1.8 J or lower. In fact, several of the compositions of the present invention are characterized by an impact resistance so high, that it is beyond the range measured in the standard Gardner impact test, which means a Gardner impact value of greater than about 36 J 320 in lb . It has been found that polyoxymethylene compositions with exceptionally high impact resistance, i.e. a Gardner impact value greater than 9 J 80 in lb , can be made only when several important parameters or conditions coexist. In particular, extraordinarily impact resistant polyoxymethylene compositions require that the polyoxymethylene polymer be of a certain molecular weight. More specifically, the polyoxymethylene polymer can be branched or linear and must have a number average molecular weight in the range of 20,000 to 100,000, preferably 25,000 to 90,000, more preferably 30,000 to 70,000, and most preferably 35,000 to 40,000. The molecular weight of the polyoxymethylene can be conveniently measured by gel permeation chromatography in m cresol at 1600C using a Du Pont PSM bimodal column kit with nominal pore size of 60 and 1000 .If the molecular weight of the polyoxymethylene polymer is too high, then processing limitations come into play, and it will be difficult to blend the polyoxymethylene with the thermoplastic polyurethane in a short enough time and at a low enough temperature to prevent significant degradation of either. This is because blending of the polyoxymethylene with the thermoplastic polyurethane is normally done at a temperature which is relatively close to the temperature at which the thermoplastic polyurethane will degrade, given enough time at that temperature.If the molecular weight of the polyoxymethylene is too high, the amount of mechanical energy necessary to achieve intimate mixing of the blend components will be so great that it will be difficult to maintain the temperature of the blend below the degradation temperature of the polyurethane, even with external cooling on the mixing apparatus. In addition, if the molecular weight of the polyoxymethylene is too high, there will be excessive orientation of the polyoxymethylene during molding of thin pieces, resulting in a lowerGardner impact value. If the molecular weight of the polyoxymethylene is too low, the melt viscosity of the polyoxymethylene will be low, and it will be difficult to achieve sufficient intimate mixing with the polyurethane such that the polyurethane will be dispersed throughout the polyoxymethylene as discrete particles. As an alternative to characterizing the polyoxymethylene by its number average molecular weight, it can be characterized by its melt flow rate. Polyoxymethylenes which are suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention will have a melt flow rate measured according to ASTMD 1238, Procedure A, Condition G with a 1.0 mm 0.0413 inch diameter orifice of 0.1 30 grams l0 minutes. Preferably, the melt flow rate of the polyoxymethylene used in the compositions of the present invention will be from 0.5 10 grams l0 minutes, most preferably about 5 grams l0 minutes for homopolymer and about 9 grams l0 minutes for copolymer. As indicated above, the polyoxymethylene can be either a homopolymer, a copolymer or a mixture thereof. Copolymers can contain one or more comonomers generally used in preparing polyoxymethylene compositions. Comonomers more commonly used include alkylene oxides of 2 12 carbon atoms. If copolymer is selected, the quantity of comonomer will be not more than 20 weight percent, preferably not more than 15 weight percent, and most preferably about 2 weight percent. The most preferred comonomer is ethylene oxide, and preferred polyoxymethylene copolymers are dipolymers of formaldehyde and ethylene oxide where the quantity of ethylene oxide is about 2 weight percent. Generally, polyoxymethylene homopolymer is preferred over copolymer because of its greater stiffness.The most preferred homopolymers for use in the compositions of the present invention are those with a molecular weight of about 38,000 and those whose terminal hydroxyl groups have been end capped by a chemical reaction to form ester or ether groups, preferably acetate or methoxy groups, respectively. The proportion of the polyoxymethylene in the compositions of the present invention should be 85 9596 by weight of the composition. Accordingly, the thermoplastic polyurethane will comprise 5 15 by weight of the composition. It should be understood that the compositions of the present invention include compositions containing only polyoxymethylene and polyurethane in the above stated proportions and also compositions containing other ingredients, modifiers and or additives including polyamide stabilizers, such as those disclosed in U.S. PatentNos. 3,960,984 and 4,098,843, anti oxidants, pigments, colorants, carbon black, reinforcing agents and fillers, provided that the above stated relative proportions of the polyoxymethylene and the thermoplastic polyurethane are maintained.Within the limits described above, and assuming all other parameters are equal, the greater the proportion of the thermoplastic polyurethane, the higher the impact resistance of the compositions of the present invention. However, at high levels of polyurethane, the incremental benefit with respect to Gardner impact resistance diminishes. Accordingly, to achieve an optimum balance between the extraordinary impact resistance of the compositions of the present invention and the other highly desirable properties ordinarily present in polyoxymethylene compositions, compositions containing 8 to 12 weight percent of polyurethane are generally preferred, most preferably about 10 weight percent polyurethane. Another important parameter necessary to the preparation of polyoxymethylene compositions characterized by exceptional impact resistance is the selection of particular thermoplastic polyurethanes.Thermoplastic polyurethanes suited for use in the compositions of the present invention can be selected from those commercially available or can be made by processes known in the art. See, for example,Rubber Technology, 2nd edition, edited by MauriceMorton 1973 , Chapter 17, Urethane Elastomers,D. A. Meyer, especially pp. 453 6 . Polyurethanes are derived from the reaction of polyester or polyether diols with diisocyanates and optionally also from the further reaction of such components with chain extending agents such as low molecular weight polyols, preferably diols, or with diamines to form urea linkages. Polyurethane elastomers are generally composed of soft segments, for example polyether or polyester polyols, and hard segments, usually derived from the reaction of the low molecular weight diols and diisocyanates.Polyurethane elastomer with no hard segments can be used to prepare compositions of the present invention. However, those most useful in the compositions of the present invention will contain both soft and hard segments. In the preparation of the thermoplastic polyurethanes useful in the compositions of the present invention, a polymeric soft segment material having at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule and having a molecular weight of at least about 500 and preferably from about 550 to about 5,000 and most preferably from about 1,000 to about 2,500, such as a dihydric polyester or a polyalkylene ether diol, is reacted with an organic diisocyanate in a ratio such that a substantially linear polyurethane polymer results, although some branching can be present. A diol chain extender having a molecular weight less than about 250 may also be incorporated. The mole ratio of isocyanate to hydroxyl in the polymer is preferably from about 0.95 to 1.08, more preferably 0.95 to 1.05, and most preferably, 0.95 to 1.00.In addition, monofunctional isocyanates or alcohols can be used to control molecular weight of the polyurethane.

Further, hydroxycarboxylic acids, lactones, and cyclic carbonates, such as caprolactone and 3 hydroxybutyric acid can be used in the preparation of the polyester. Preferred polyesters include poly ethylene adipate , poly l,4 butylene adipate , mixtures of these adipates and polyS caprolactone. Suitable polyether polyols include the condensation products of one or more alkylene oxides with a small amount of one or more compounds having active hydrogen containing groups, such as water, ethylene glycol, 1,2 or 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol and 1,5 pentanediol, and mixtures thereof. Suitable alkylene oxide condensates include those of ethylene oxide, 1,2 propylene oxide and butylene oxide and mixtures thereof. Suitable polyalkylene ether glycols may also be prepared from tetrahydrofuran. In addition, suitable polyether polyols can contain comonomers, especially as random or block comonomers, ether glycols derived from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and or tetrahydrofuran THF . Alternatively, a THF polyether copolymer with minor amounts of 3 methylTHF can also be used. Preferred polyethers include poly tetramethylene ether glycol PTMEG , polytpropylene oxide glycol, copolymers of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, and copolymers of tetrahydrofuran and ethylene oxide. Other suitable polymeric diols include those which are primarily hydrocarbon in nature, e.g., polybutadiene diol. Suitable organic diisocyanates include 1,4 butylene diisocyanate, 1, 6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, cyclopentylene 1,3 diisocyanate, 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, cyclohexylene 1,4 diisocyanate, 2 ,4 tolylene diisocyanate, 2 ,6 tolylene diisocyanate, isomeric mixtures of 2,4 and 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4 methylene bis phenylisocyanate , 2,2 d iphenylpropane 4,4l diisocyanate, p phenylene diisocyanate, m phenylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, 1,4 naphthylene diisocyanate, 1,5 naphthylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenyl diisocyanate, azobenzene 4, 41 diisocyanate, m or p tetramethylxylene diisocyanate and l chlorobenzene 2,4 diisocyanate. 4,4 Methylene bis phenylisocyanate , 1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate are preferred. Secondary amide linkages including those derived from adipyl chloride and piperazine, and secondary urethane linkages, including those derived from the bis chloroformates of PTMEG and or butanediol, can also be present in the polyurethanes. Dihydric alcohols suitable for use as chain extending agents in the preparation of the thermoplastic polyurethanes include those containing carbon chains which are either uninterrupted or which are interrupted by oxygen or sulfur linkages, including 1,2 ethanediol, 1,2 propanediol, isopropyl a glyceryl ether, 1,3 propanediol, 1,3 butanediol, 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2,2diethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 ethyl 2 butyl l ,3 propanediol, 2 methyl 2,4 pentanediol, 2,2 ,4 trimethyl l,3 pentanediol, 2 ethyl 1,3 hexanediol, 1,4 butanediol, 2,5 hexanediol, 1,5 pentanediol, dihydroxycyclopentane, 1,6 hexanediol, 1,4 cyclohexanediol, 4,4 cyclohexanedimethylol, thiodiglycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 2 methyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 methyl 2 ethyl l, 3 propanediol, dihydroxyethyl ether of hydroquinone, hydrogenated bisphenol A, dihydroxyethyl terephtalate and dihydroxymethyl benzene and mixtures thereof. Hydroxyl terminated oligomers of 1,4 butanediol terephthalate can also be used, giving a polyester urethane polyester repeating structure.Diamines can also be used as chain extending agents giving urea linkages. 1,4 Butanediol, 1,2 ethanediol and 1,6 hexanediol are preferred. In the preparation of the thermoplastic polyurethanes the ratio of isocyanate to hydroxyl should be close to unity, and the reaction can be a one step or a two step reaction. Catalyst can be used, and the reaction can be run neat or in a solvent. Apart from what is described above concerning selection of the polyurethane, the most important characteristic of the thermoplastic polyurethane is its soft segment glass transition temperature Tg . Wherever a glass transition temperature is reported herein, it is as determined using a Du Pont Model 981 Dynamic Mechanical AnalysisCell attached to a Model 990 DTA instrument. The cell was modified to use liquid nitrogen as the coolant and to allow the use of a 3.2 cm 1.25 inch gap holding the specimen. The oscillation amplitude was set at 0.2 mm. A heating rate of 2.50C min was used from 1700C to 0 to 400C depending on the signal amplitude. Readings were taken every 10C increment.The storage and loss moduli were plotted and the major loss modulus peak was defined as the soft segment glass transition temperature. It has been found that, all other parameters being equal, the lower the glass transition temperature of the soft segment of the thermoplastic polyurethane, the higher the impact resistance. Compositions of the present invention having extraordinary impact resistance can best be made when the soft segment glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic polyurethane is less than OOC. Preferably, the soft segment glass transition temperature of the polyurethane should be less than 10 C, more preferably below 15 C, and most preferably below 300C. Combinations or mixtures of thermoplastic polyurethanes can also be used in the compositions of the present invention. These parameters discussed above have been found to be the most important in determining whether one can prepare a polyoxymethylene thermoplastic polyurethane composition having extraordinary impact resistance. Clearly, the optimum composition, i.e. the composition having the highest impact resistance while maintaining an adequate level of other properties important in polyoxymethylene compositions and fabricated articles, will result when one chooses materials and conditions representing the optimum value for each of these most important parameters.For example, to achieve the optimum composition, one should choose a polyoxymethylene homopolymer of moderate molecular weight e.g. about 30,000 40,000 and a thermoplastic polyurethane of low soft segment glass transition temperature e.g. about 350C , and one should blend about 90 by weight of the polyoxymethylene with about 10 by weight of the thermoplastic polyurethane in such a way as to intimately mix these two components and to disperse the thermoplastic polyurethane in the polyoxymethylene as small discrete particles.Equally clearly, one can prepare compositions of the present invention having extraordinary impact resistance, albeit perhaps not as high as the optimum composition, by deviating from the optimum on one or more of most important parameters discussed above.These parameters, however, are interdependent, each with each other, and the effect of deviating from the optimum on each of these parameters may be cumulative. Thus if one chooses to operate at the fringe with respect to several or all of these parameters, it is possible to prepare polyoxymethylene thermoplastic polyurethane compositions that will be useful, but whose impact resistance will be less than extraordinary. Thus it becomes important to define what is considered extraordinary impact resistance. For the purpose of defining the present invention, impact resistance is measured according to ASTM D 3029, Method G, Geometry D using a 3.6 kg weight Gardner Impact . Each sample was injection molded as a plaque 7.6 x 12.7 x 0.16 cm 3 in x 5 in x 1 16 in . The plaques were allowed to stand at room temperature at least two days after molding prior to testing. Twenty five samples of each composition were tested at room temperature and the average value determined by the Bruceton StaircaseMethod was reported. As mentioned above, the polyoxymethylene thermoplastic polyurethane compositions of the present invention are considered to have extraordinary impact resistance when they are characterized by a Gardner impact rating of greater than 9 J, preferably greater than 17 J, more preferably greater than 25 J and most preferably greater than 34 J.Accordingly, compositions of the present invention will consist essentially of a 5 15 by weight of at least one thermoplastic polyurethane, which polyurethane has a soft segment glass transition temperature of lower than 00C, and b 85 95 by weight of at least one polyoxymethylene polymer, which polyoxymethylene polymer has a number average molecular weight of from 20,000 to 100,000, the above stated percentages being based on the total amount of components a and b only, the thermoplastic polyurethane being dispersed throughout the polyoxymethylene as discrete particles, and the composition having a Gardner impact value of greater than 9 J.As noted above, various other ingredients, modifiers and or additives can be included in the compositions of the present invention, provided that the above stated relative proportions of the polyoxymethylene and the polyurethane are maintained. While the parameters discussed above are the most important in determining whether a particular polyoxymethylene thermoplastic polyurethane composition will be characterized by extraordinary impact resistance, other parameters can influence to a lesser degree the impact resistance of a particular composition. For example, the molecular weight of the soft segment of the thermoplastic polyurethane will influence the properties of the composition. If the molecular weight of the soft segment is too low, the glass transition temperature will not be low enough. This is believed to be due to incomplete separation of the soft segments from the hard segments. If the molecular weight of the soft segment is too high, crystallization will result, and the polyurethane glass transition temperature will be too high. Generally, the molecular weight of the soft segment should average between about 500 and about 5000, preferably about 850 3000, more preferably about 1000 2500, with the most preferred polyurethanes having soft segments with an average molecular weight of about 2000. The desired soft segment average molecular weight can be achieved with a narrow molecular weight distribution or with a broad molecular weight distribution. In fact, one can prepare the compositions of the present invention with blends of polyurethanes having very high and very low molecular weight soft segments outside the ranges stated above such that the average molecular weight of the soft segment is within the ranges stated above, i.e., with polyurethanes having an extremely broad molecular weight distribution for the soft segments. Similarly, the melt viscosity of the thermoplastic polyurethane at the compounding temperature will influence the properties of the composition. If the melt viscosity is too low, it will be difficult to disperse the polyurethane into discrete particles. If the melt viscosity is too high, the thermoplastic polyurethane becomes difficult to process at a temperature below its decomposition temperature. It is believed that the important aspect with respect to the melt viscosity of the polyurethane is how closely it approximates the melt viscosity of the polyoxymethylene at the processing temperature. As a practical matter, melt viscosity of the polyurethane at the compounding temperature cannot be accurately measured because the preferred compounding temperatures are extremely close to the degradation temperatures of the polyurethanes. Thus, inherent viscosity of the polyurethane is used instead. Melt viscosity is related to inherent viscosity, although not necessarily in direct proportion. The preferred melt viscosity or inherent viscosity for the polyurethane in a given composition will depend on the chemical type of the polyurethane and the melt viscosity or inherent viscosity of the polyoxymethylene.For example, it has been found that when the polyurethane is of the ADIP BDO MDI type, such as polyurethane B in Table I below, and the polyoxymethylene in acetate end capped homopolymer of number average molecular weight of about 38,000, then it is especially preferred that the inherent viscosity of the polyurethane be from 0.75 1.50. It should be understood that inherent viscosity is only a means of evaluating the approximately melt viscosity of the polyurethane, and it is the melt viscosity at the compounding temperature that is really the parameter of concern.Accordingly, it is possible to start with a polyurethane having a very low inherent viscosity, and then modify it during the blending operation, e.g., by further polymerization or cross linking, thus increasing the effective melt viscosity of the polyurethane to a desirable level, even though the inherent viscosity of the starting material polyurethane was quite low. Alternatively, one could begin with a polyurethane having a higher inherent viscosity and degrade or hydrolyze it during compounding to obtain the desired effective melt viscosity. Alternatively, one could use blends of high and low molecular weight polyurethanes. The moisture content of the composition, in particular of the polyurethane, can influence the results achieved. Water is known to react with polyurethanes, causing the polyurethane to degrade, lowering the effective molecular weight of the polyurethane. Accordingly, the drier the better. In any event, the ingredients in the compositions of the present invention and the compositions of the present invention themselves should contain less than 0.2 percent by weight of water, preferably less than 0.1 percent, especially when there is no opportunity for the water to escape, for example during injection molding. The processing conditions used in the preparation and molding of the compositions of the present invention can also influence the impact resistance of the compositions. As mentioned above, the polyurethane must be intimately mixed and dispersed as discrete particles in the polyoxymethylene, and it must be maintained in that state during the formation of the finished articles.These particles of polyurethane can be approximately spherical in shape i.e., the particles will have an aspect ratio approximately equal to 1.0 or elongated i.e., the particles will have an aspect ratio substantially greater than 1.0 , and their size distribution can be Gaussian, bi or polymodal or other. If elongated, they can be only slightly elongated and approximately oval in shape, or they can be greatly elongated and resemble strands of thermoplastic polyurethane running through the polyoxymethylene continuous phase. Accordingly, when reference is made to the compositions of the present invention, that is meant to include molded articles or shaped products as well as melt compounded material that can be subsequently shaped or molded. Any intensive mixing device capable of developing high shear at temperatures above the melting points of the ingredients can be used to disperse the polyurethane in the polyoxymethylene.Examples of such devices include rubber mills, internal mixers such as Banbury and Brabender mixers, single or multiblade internal mixers with a cavity heated externally or by friction, Ko kneaders , multibarrel mixers such as FarrelContinuous Mixers , injection molding machines, and extruders, both single screw and twin screw, both co rotating and counter rotating. These devices can be used alone or in combination with static mixers, mixing torpedos and or various devices to increase internal pressure an or the intensity of mixing such as valves, gates or screws designed for this purpose. Continuous devices are preferred. Twin screw extruders are especially preferred, particularly those incorporating high intensity mixing sections such as reverse pitch elements and kneading elements.The mixing device used in all of the examples of the present application unless noted otherwise was a 28 mm co rotating Werner andPfleiderer twin screw extruder, using a screw design containing two working sections with a total of five kneading elements, two reverse elements, and a vacuum port at about 70 of the distance from the feed throat to the die. All zones were set at 1900C. Temperature of the melt coming out of the die was about 220 2600C. A low flow of cooling water was used to reduce temperatures in some cases. The extruder was operated at 225 250 rpm with 6.8 13.6 kg 15 30 pounds per hour throughput. A nitrogen blanket was maintained over the feed throat to exclude oxygen and preserve dryness of the ingredients, and the strand exiting the die was quenched in water and cut into pellets. One can deviate from those conditions. For example melt temperatures below 1900C or higher than 2600C are possible if throughout is adjusted to compensate and unmelted or decomposed product is not produced. However, 170 2600C is considered preferred, with 185 2400C preferred, and 200 2300C most preferred for melt compounding. The melt temperatures indicated are estimates based upon measurements taken exit the die. Depending on the extruder configuration, there can be significant cooling between the last point of mixing and the die. Actual melt temperatures may be somewhat higher. Equally important are the fabricating conditions used in the preparation of shaped articles, for if one prepares the shaped articles of the present invention from previously melt compounded material, it is important to maintain the conditions created in the melt compounded material, such as distribution of the thermoplastic polyurethane as discrete particles in the polyoxymethylene, dryness of the composition, etc. Shaped articles can be made by any of several common methods, including compression molding, injection molding, extrusion, blow molding, rotational molding, melt spinning, thermoforming and stamping. Examples of shaped articles include sheet, profiles, rod stock, film, filaments, fibers, strapping, tape, tubing and pipe.Such shaped articles can be post treated by orientation, stretching, coating, annealing, painting, laminating and plating. Unused shaped articles, rejected shaped articles or waste composition of the present invention can be ground and remolded. It should be noted that, in addition to having extraordinary impact resistance, the compositions of the present invention can be used to make extruded rod having improved toughness, as indicated by increased elongation in standard tensile tests. Further, a significant increase in toughness elongation is apparent in compositions with as little as 5 polyurethane. In addition, preparation of thick articles, including rod, from polyoxymethylene frequently results in voids formed in the center of such articles because of the normal contraction of the polyoxymethylene upon cooling and the fact that cooling of thick articles will occur unevenly, i.e., from the outside inward. It has been found that the compositions of the present invention will produce such thick articles with significantly fewer and or smaller voids, in some cases even eliminating the voids altogether. Generally, the conditions used in the preparation of shaped articles will be similar to those described above for melt compounding. More specifically, melt temperatures and residence times can be used up to the points at which significant degradation of the polyurethane occurs. Preferably, the melt temperature will be about l70 2500C, more preferably about 185 2400C, and most preferably about 200 2300C. When injection molding the compositions of the present invention, it is preferable that the mold be as cold as possible consistent with the intricacy of the shape being produced. That is, generally, the colder the mold, the higher the impact resistance of the shaped article. However, colder molds are harder to fill, particularly where the passages may be narrow or the shape is intricate.Generally, the mold temperature will be 10 1200C, preferably 10 1000C, and most preferably the mold temperature will be about 50 900C. Similarly, the cycle time, which determines the total hold up time in the melt, can be adjusted to fit the particular conditions being encountered. For example, if the total hold up time in the melt is too long, the polyurethane can degrade. If the cycle time is too short, the shaped article may not totally solidify while the mold is still under pressure. Generally, total hold up time in the melt will be about 3 15 minutes, with the shorter times being preferred, consistent with giving a high quality shaped article.As an example, the 0.16 cm 1 16 in thick test specimens used in the Gardner impact tests can be prepared in a 6 ounce reciprocating screw injection molding machine using cylinder temperatures of 180 2100C with a mold temperature of 25 1200C, a minimal back pressure, a screw speed of 60 120 rpm, a fast ram speed setting, a cycle of 30 15 60 30 seconds for injection hold, and a general purpose screw. Samples were allowed to stand for at least two days between molding and testing. Specific molding conditions used in each of the Examples are described in Table II below. In the following examples, there are shown specific embodiments of the present invention and certain side by comparisons with embodiments of control experiments where one or more of the parameters discussed above was chosen outside the range defining the limits of the present invention.It will be seen that the compositions of the present invention are characterized by extraordinary impact resistance, while the control compositions are not.All parts and percentages are by weight, and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless otherwise specified. Measurements not originally in SI units have been so converted and rounded where appropriate. In the following examples Flexural Modulus was determined in accord with ASTM 790, Geometry A,Method A on three specimens and the average value is reported. Samples were allowed to stand at least two days at room temperature after molding. The chemical composition of each of the commercially available thermoplastic polyurethanes tested was determined using a Varian Associates Model XL 200 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. Proton spectra were used. The thermoplastic polyurethane was dissolved in deutero 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane at 2 5 solids and was examined at 100 1200C. In the following examples, in addition to the thermoplastic polyurethane and the polyoxymethylene, all but three the controls inTables III and IV and the acetate end capped homopolymer having a number average molecular weight of about 38,000 in Example 33 of the compositions tested contained 1.5 weight percent of a polyamide oligomer stabilizer as described in U.S. Patent No.3,960,984 and 0.1 weight percent of a 4,4 butylidene bis 6 t butyl m cresol antioxidant.The controls in Tables III and IV and the acetate end capped homopolymer having a molecular weight of about 38,000 in Example 33 contained 0.4 of a polyamide stabilizer terpolymer of approximately 38 polycaprolactam, 35 polyhexamethylene adipamide, and 278 polyhexamethylene sebacamide and 0.1 of 2,2 methylene bis 6 t butyl 4 methyl phenol . In addition, the copolymers used in Examples 28 33 may have contained additives proprietary to the supplier. Unless stated otherwise, the polyoxymethylene was an acetate end capped homopolymer prepared according to U.S. Patent 2,998,409 having a number average molecular weight of about 38,000. The use of stabilizers and antioxidants is not necessary for the operability of the present invention. They were used in the following examples to improve thermal and oxidative stability, and they do not exert a significant influence on the impact resistance of the compositions tested.

The vessel was about 95 mm inside diameter and about 160 mm high. It terminated in a 55 50 inner joint. It was used with a top made from a 55 50 outer joint which was fitted with a 10 mm Truebore stirring guide for the mechanical stirrer, a 10 30 outer joint for the thermometer 17.8 cm immersion , and an additional 29 26 outer joint to allow additions. The stirrer blade was a glass propeller about 41 mm wide. 438.0 grams of a mixture containing 3280g of Rucoflex S 102 P 55 dried hydroxy terminated butylene adipate, hydroxyl number 55 and 819.7g of recently distilled 4,41 methylene bis phenylisocyanate was added to the cylindrical polymerization vessel. 1 drop about 0.01g of DAssCO 33 LV 33 wt. trimethylene diamine in dipropylene glycol cyclic amine catalyst was added to this mixture. The catalyst was stirred into the diol mixture for 2 hours. Then 9 drops DABCO 33LV was added with l4.95g butane diol dried . After 4 minutes of rapid stirring, the viscous mass was poured into a pan coated with Teflona fluorocarbon polymer which had been preheated in a 100C vacuum oven.The oven containing the pan and the polymerizing mixture was evacuated to 9 inches mercury pressure and swept with nitrogen. The polymerization was allowed to continue for 46 hours at 100or and 0.95 atmosphere of nitrogen. The polymer which resulted, hereinafter referred to as polyurethane A, was removed from the vacuum oven and allowed to cool. The inherent viscosity determined for this polymer was 1.04 0.1 in DMF at 30 C . Polyurethane A was then chopped into cubes 6 mm on an edge for melt compounding, injection molding and Gardner testing as described above. TheGardner impact for a blend of 1096 of this polyurethane in polyoxymethylene homopolymer was 32.1J. Examples 2 9 Effect of Thermoplastic Polyurethane Proportion Polyurethane B, described in detail inTable I, above, was blended in various proportions into polyoxymethylene homopolymer, injection molded into test plaques, and tested for flexural modulus and Gardner impact with the following results Table III Polyurethane Flex.

Examples 10 13 Effect of Polyurethane Soft Segment Glass Transition Temperature Compositions were prepared with 10 weight percent of each of four chemically similar thermoplastic polyurethanes and 90 weight percent of polyoxymethylene homopolymer. All four of the polyurethanes have PTMEG soft segments and BDO MDI hard segments. In addition, the inherent viscosity of the four polyurethanes was within a relatively narrow range. Plaques were prepared and tested as described above, with the results reported in Table V below Table V Soft SegmentExample Polyurethane Gardner J Tg OC 10 C 34.3 61 11 D 21.4 28 12 E 17.5 26 13 F 0.9 4 Examples 14 17 Effect of Polyurethane Inherent Viscosity As discussed above, it is most preferred that the melt viscosity of the polyurethane and of the polyoxymethylene match at the processing temperature.Inherent viscosity is used as an approximation, and this example demonstrates the optimum polyurethane inherent viscosity for one particular system. The compositions prepared for each of these four examples contained 5 polyurethane in polyoxymethylene homopolymer. The polyurethanes used in each of these examples was chemically analyzed as being essentially the same as polyurethane B listed in Table I above . The samples were all prepared as described for Example 31 in Table II above, and the results are reported in Table VI below Table VIExample Inherent Viscosity Gardner J 14 0.64 13.9 15 0.96 34.2 16 1.36 32.9 17 1.91 8.8 Example 18 Effect of Mold Temserature Blends of 10 weight percent of polyurethaneB and 90 weight percent of polyoxymethylene homopolymer were melt compounded and injection molded into plaques under identical conditions except that some plaques were prepared in a 6OOC mold, and others were prepared in a 1000C mold. Other processing conditions are described in detail in Table II above. The plaques from the 600C mold had a Gardner impact value of 36 J. The plaques from the 1000C mold had a Gardner impact value of 7.3 J.

In each of the following examples, 10 weight percent of polyurethaneB was melt compounded as described above with 90 weight percent of each of the listed polyoxymethylene copolymers and a comparative polyoxymethylene homopolymer. Standard test plaques were prepared by injection molding, as described in Table II above, and Gardner impact values were obtained.The results are reported in Table VIII below. All of the polyoxymethylene polymers n these examples are dipolymers containing approximately 2 weight percent ethylene oxide, except for Example 36, which is a homopolymer.

One part of a melt compounded composition containing 30 weight percent of polyurethane B in 70 weight percent of an acetate end capped polyoxymethylene homopolymer having a number average molecular weight of about 63,000 was dry blended with two parts each of two different low molecular weight polyoxymethylenes. One was an acetate end capped homopolymer having a molecular weight of about 38,000. The other was Polyplastic M90 02, which is a dipolymer containing about 2 weight percent ethylene glycol. Each dry blend was injection molded as described in Table II above and tested for Gardner impact. These compositions, each now containing 10 weight percent polyurethane, gave Gardner impact values of 27.6 J and 24.4 J, respectively.

An additional 0.025 lubricant was added to pellets of this composition as a surface coating. Rods were produced using a 2 inch TEC single screw extruder attached to a manifold and dual 70 mm rod dies. A dual positive take off brake was used.Extrusion conditions were as follows barrel, adaptor and die temperatures 340, 35C, 360, 370, 370, 3700F melt temperature 3750F melt pressure 650 750 psi water temperature for forming die 850F take off rate 1 2 in min.Samples of rod were machined into test specimens.Discs somewhat over 1 8 inch thick were cut off the rods using a lathe. Discs were inspected to see they were free of surface imperfections. Using a surface grinder they were reduced to a uniform thickness of 1 8 inch. A center strip 1 2 inch wide was cut from each disc, and tensile specimens were cut from them with a router. The test section was 1 8 in x 1 8 in x 1 3 8 in.Five specimens from each rod were tested for tensile strength and elongation according to the procedure set forth in ASTM D 638.

The extraordinary impact resistance and exceptional wear resistance of articles made from these compositions combined with other outstanding properties normally found in polyoxymethylene compositions make them particularly well suited for applications such as gears and moving parts.
