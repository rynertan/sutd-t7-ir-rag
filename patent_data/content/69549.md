# Method of positioning a transducer over a disc.

## Abstract
A method for positioning and maintaining a disc head 20 over a desired track centreline on a disc 14 rotatably carried on a disc drive 10 . The distance between the current position of the disc head and the desired track centreline is monitored, and a signal generally proportional to that distance is applied to the disc head moving mechanism to cause the disc head to move toward the track centreline. The control signal is clipped if it exceeds predetermined max imum and minimum values.
