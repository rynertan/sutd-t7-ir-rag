# High frequency switching circuit.

## Abstract
A switching element 12 is connected between a power supply 11 and the primary winding 13₁ of a transformer 13 , and it is on off controlled with a predetermined cycle and with a predetermined conducting period. The secondary winding 13₂ of the transformer 13 is connected to a parallel circuit of a filtering capacitor 20 and a load 19 via a rectifier diode 17 and a choke coil 18 . A closed circuit, to which the reflux current of the choke coil 18 flows through the parallel circuit of the filtering capacitor 20 and load 19 , is formed by a reflux diode 21 .
