## Description
With the advent of the so called computer revolution , many business organizations are now making day to day use of computer facilities of all kinds. For example, industrial and commercial corporations place most or all of their statistical data, including marketing information, inventory control, and payroll, on computers. However, even with the high electrical and mechanical efficiency characteristic of modern computers, these computers still generate considerable heat. Because of their operating characteristics, they require relatively high voltage, high power input currents, and also involve the use of very high currents of lower voltage, usually direct currents DC . Computers require a carefully controlled temperature and humidity environment. This has given rise to the existence of the so called computer room in large offices or like facilities. The usual computer room is a room or area which has been selected from among other rooms for adaption to the specialty requirements of computers, by being provided with heating, ventilating, and air conditioning HVAC capacities suitable to its requirements, as well as being wired to provide high power AC and DC electrical service. Actual computers themselves, as well as peripheral equipment drives, printers, etc. , are usually placed on false floors which superficially resemble a false ceiling, except that the false floors are able to withstand considerably more weight than can be carried or supported by a false ceiling. The false floor is placed in the computer room not only to support the computer itself, but also, and perhaps primarily, to provide a space beneath the computer work floor for installing and maintaining electrical wires and connectors which are used with the computer. In many computer rooms , air conditioning evaporators also rest on the floor. The present invention is compatible with these systems, but also provides design alternatives to these concepts, where desired. As the computers grow or are added to, with an increase in capacity or change of components, there is the continuing need to alter the wiring, and environmental control ducts. Thus, a proper computer room must not only include sufficient space for computers per se, their peripheral equipment such as tape or disk drives, and the like, but also for printers and other types of equipment having substantial mechanical components. The room must afford access to these machines by computer workers, who require an uncluttered floor space which can be used by them in computer operation and maintenance. Consequently, access to the electrical, mechanical, and other connections is usually gained through the floor. Computer room construction planning is controlled by local fire and building codes which commonly require the isolation of at least three different types of conductors. These include heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ducts which will ensure that fresh air, return air, heating and cooling air, and the like are channelled into the room without being contaminated by unfiltered or uncontrolled sources of ventilation. It is essential that the air circulation system be reasonably well protected against generation, inhalation and circulation of smoke, noxious gases or vapours, and the like, for the protection of the building occupants and the machinery as well. Codes also require that high voltage wiring not only be insulated per se, but also be sheathed or protected within its own wireway or conduit and electrical ground system so that the wiring is not subject to mechanical damage in its normal working environment. Low voltage wires should also be protected. In other words, insulated wire containing protective rubber and plastic insulation could still be the cause of fire or shock hazards if the protective coatings are pierced during conduct of operations not related to the computer. Three known apparatuses are disclosed in GB 2115853A, EP 0075143A and DE 2244596A respectively. The first reference discloses a raised floor having support bars extending horizontally between vertical positioning brackets. The support bars support open troughs in which cables can be disposed. The second reference discloses a false floor building construction wherein a second floor is provided for the purpose of positioning heat conductive or heat storage materials adjacent the lower surface of a work area floor. The third reference shows a system of structural elements for disposition beneath a floor. Movable or adjustable sidewalls and a top cover or deck allow adjustment of the space below the top cover or deck. The invention, in practice, provides a combination support floor and conduit protection assembly which includes a plurality of columns, a plurality of brackets, and a plurality of wall and floor panels arranged on vertically spaced apart levels to define support floor areas for electrical conductors, isolated plenums for these conductors and for the passage of air and wall panels arranged so as to provide vertically extending passages through which the air may flow and through which the conductors may extend between levels. The invention also provides a method of supporting a computer and protectively isolating electrical conductors by modular construction of support and isolating elements. According to the present invention, therefore, an apparatus for use within a building structure having building walls and a building floor to provide a working area floor spaced above said building floor and to subdivide the space beneath said working area floor into at least two separate spaces, is characterised by a plurality of vertically extending floor support column units each having upper and lower end portions and an intermediate column section, a working area floor positioned by and diposed adjacent said upper end of said support column units, means on said intermediate sections of said support column units for positioning and supporting at least one conductor support floor, at least one conductor support floor positioned by said positioning and supporting means in downwardly spaced apart relation to said working area floor, wall means extending generally vertically between portions of said at least one said conductor support floor and said working area floor and cooperating with portions of said at leat one conductor support floor and said working area floor to define the interior of at least one mechanically isolated wireway space adapted to receive and support electrical conductors, said working area floor also including means providing access to the interior of at least one said wireway from the area above said working area floor, with said at least one conductor support floor, said wall means and at least a portion of said building floor structure cooperating to define a space beneath said work area floor which is mechanically isolated from said wireway. The exact manner in which the invention is carried into practice will become more clearly apparent when reference is made to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention set forth by way of example, and shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numbers indicate corresponding parts throughout. In the drawings, While it will be understood that the concept of the invention is applicable to a number of installations, and that constructional details thereof may be varied, a description of a preferred form of the invention will be given wherein there are provided a top combination machine support and working floor extending horizontally above a building floor structure, a lower conductor support floor and passage, and an intermediate structure adapted to support another set of cables or like conductors within their own isolated passage. Accordingly, while the illustration shows uppermost, lowermost and intermediate support floors on a structure disposed above a building floor, it is within the scope of the invention to provide only a single intermediate floor and conduit assembly, or two or more of such intermediate floods forming parts of isolated passages. Likewise, while a preferred form of floor and panel modual assembly has been described, it will be understood that, for reasons of manufacturing or assembly, certain variations may be made in the described forms of structure and that such changes will fall within the scope of the invention. Referring now to the drawings in greater detail, Fig.1 shows a modular support floor and conduit assembly embodying the invention, generally designated 20 and shown to be situated within a closed off room area 22, defined in part by vertically extending room walls 24 having one or more HVAC inlet openings 26, and that a working floor portion generally designated 28 is provided to support a computer 30. According to the invention, the upper or work support floor generally designated 28 is comprised of a plurality of imperforate panels 32, 32a, etc., and one or more perforated panels 34, 34a. The panel 34 is shown to have a plurality of small round apertures 36, while the panel 34a is shown to have peripheral louvres or vents 38 some apertured panels are typically dedicated to supply air and other to return air in the form shown. The invention also is shown to comprise an intermediate conductor support floor generally designated 40 and shown to include a plurality of identical intermediate floor panels 42 similarly, a lower support floor unit generally designated 44 is shown to be comprised of a plurality of lower floor panels 46, which may be identical to the panels 42, for example. Various vertically extending modular wall panels 48 are shown to be provided and to extend between the intermediate floor 40 and the work support floor 28, for example, and also to extend between the lower floor 44 and the intermediate floor 40. While Fig. 1 shows that a vertically extending panel, such as the panel 50 may be made to span two floor levels but be made in one piece, it is preferred, according to the invention, that all wall panels be single story or single height, such as the panels 48, far reasons of economy in producing and installing such wall panels. The other principal assemblies of the invention include the columns 52, their associated floor and wall supports 54, and a series of corner bracket or stringer support assemblies generally designated 56 in Fig.1 and which are described in detail elsewhere herein. While detailed reference to the operation of the floor system of the invention is made elsewhere, it will be noted from Fig.1, which is partially diagrammatic in character, that the arrangement of the vertically spaced apart floors and individual walls is such that a series of high voltage electrical conductors 58 may be arranged on the lower floor 44 and may extend through a plenum or isolated passage generally designated 60 which terminates beneath the computer and that the intermediate floor 40 supports a plurality of conductors 62 which also extend from a source not shown through their own plenum or isolated passage 64 to a location beneath a portion of the computer, at which point they pass through apertured floor panels respectively designated 66,68. As shown, by extending through their own plenums or isolated passages, the cables or like conductors 58,62 are protected from mechanically overlying one another, and are also protected from the invironment. The space between the building floor structure shown at 70 and the lower surface of the lower floor 44 also forms a plenum generally designated 72 for the passage of air, which may enter the room or be exhausted therefrom, through the grille work 38, or through the apertures 36 in the panel 34, for example. For this purpose, it may be assumed that, as shown by the arrows, the louvres 38 provide inlet air, whereas the openings or apertures 36 provide a return air path. According to the invention, it is not necessary that the path be arranged as illustrated, but only that mechanical isolation be provided between cables of different character, and that they be isolated from the heating, ventilating and air conditioning HVAC ducts for the reasons referred to herein. Referring now to Fig.2, certain elements of the structure of the invention are shown in greater detail. Thus, referring in particular to Figs. 2 and 3, selected mechanical parts of the invention are shown to include a vertically extending column 100, having a collar 102 at the bottom thereof and including a threaded column height adjustment stud 104 extending axially outwardly from the bottom of the column 100, with the stud 104 being adapted to be received within a holddown plate 106 having a threaded central opening 108 and a plurality of stiffening offsets or dimples 110 therein to increase the stiffness of the plate 106. The stud 104 providing the height adjustment feature may instead be provided at the upper end of the column 100, if desired. Alternatively, these parts may be positioned and welded in place at the factory. Referring now to the upper end 112 of the column 100, there is shown to be a work support floor bracket 114 of cruciform shape and having four legs 116 extending outwardly therefrom with each leg having a tapped fastener receiving opening 118 therein. As shown, the legs 116 on the top bracket 114 are adapted to be received within an open end 120 of one of a plurality of floor panel supports or stringers 122, with each support 122 preferably being of inverted U shaped cross section and having a flat top surface portion 124 and opposed legs or flanges 126, 128 which may be extended vertically or may be inclined so as to have a taper, for example. The end portion 120 of each panel support 122 has an opening 130 therein for receiving a fastener 132 adapted to be received in the opening 118 in the bracket 114. As will be apparent, when the top bracket 114 is positioned over the top of the top 112 of the column 100, and each panel support 122 is positioned so that the openings 130, 118 are in registry, the fastener 132 may be inserted to hold the structure. Thereafter, the corner portion 134 of a rigid floor panel is positioned, along with a number of its counterparts such as the panels 32, 32a, to form a complete floor Fig.1 . Fig.3 shows the assembled form of the exploded elements in Fig.2, with the panel 136 resting atop one of the supports 122 and with the top of the column 112 supporting the bracket 114. Referring again to Fig.2, the construction of the intermediate support bracket and its associated parts are shown. These parts include an intermediate support bracket 140 having a centre section of square cross section and adapted to be received over the exterior of the square column 100, and to include four substantially identical legs 142 extending outwardly therefrom. Each leg in turn includes a pair of stringer support fingers 144 flanking an upturned locator stud 146 disposed between them and adapted for reception in the opening 148 on the end portion 150 of the combination floor and wall support stringer 152. The intermediate bracket 140 also contains plural transversely extending openings 154 for reception of a positioning pin 156, for vertical location of the bracket 140. Referring to the floor and wall support stringers or channels 152, each of these substantially identical units will be seen to be of generally H shaped cross section, but preferably having, in addition to a centre section 158, inclined legs 160 which facilitate the panel assembly process, as will appear. Another element of the intermediate floor and wall system is the floor panel 162 having downwardly extending peripheral flanges 164 and a notched out corner portion 166. In the preferred form, the flanges 164 extending downwardly from the floor panel 162 have the same degree of taper as the inclined walls 160 of the channels 152. An additional important element of the floor and wall support unit is a panel clamp generally designated 170, and shown to include a central opening 172 through which the column 100 may extend, a pair of locating ears 174, each having an opening 176 therethrough for accommodating a positioning pin 178. Each clamp also comprises four substantially identical, radially outwardly extending panel locks each comprising opposed, angularly downturned flanges 180 having a bevel or inclination generally parallel to that forming the flanges 160 on the supports 152 and the flanges 164 on the panels 162. The body of the clamp 170 is thus formed of a generally flat surface 182 with various parts of it being subdivided into four identical panel locking sections each having opposed margins from which downwardly extending flanges are formed, and having a central portion from which opposed upwardly extending flanges are formed. As is apparent, once the stringers or combination floor and wall support units are installed with respect to the bracket 140, the panels 162 are placed in the structure, and the clamp 170 is positioned and pinned in place to lock the panel units in their desired positions of assembly. Fig.2 also shows another element of the invention, namely, the wall panel 184, generally corresponding to the vertical wall panels 48 shown in Fig.1. This panel is imperforate and, in use, it and its counterparts will lie within the upwardly directed opening formed between the flanges 160 and the centre section 158 of the channel 152 and the legs or flanges 126, 128 of the top floor support 122. As shown in Fig.3, which shows the assembled form of the unit of Fig.2, a floor is formed by the panels 162 whose margins 164 extend downwardly along the flanges 160 on the supports 152, with the inner ends 150 of the supports 152 lying adjacent the column 100 and being held in place by the locking system described. The wall panel 184 is positioned as shown in Fig.3. For purposes of illustration, Figs. 2 and 3 show only one floor assembly lying beneath the upper floor, but it is understood that any number of bracket assemblies may be provided and that each would position the desired supports for the floor and wall panels just described. Referring now to Fig.4, certain assembly details of the unit are shown, the portions being broken away to illustrate the successive assembly, namely, that the bracket 140 surrounds the column 100 and is positioned by the pin 156, that the studs 146 extend through the openings 148 to position the channels 152, and that with the panels 162 in place, the clamp 170 provides security for the corner structure and prevents disassembly thereof, holding the floor panels in their desired positions of use. The clamp also serves the function of ensuring that there is a relatively impermeable corner joint where the panels intersect the columns. According to the invention, the brackets 140 and the clamp 170 may be positioned by openings previously drilled in the columns 100, or such openings may be formed on the construction site. Figs. 6 and 7 shown the clamp member 170 being held by the pin 178 which also extends through the column 100 and through the openings 154. The clamping action afforded by the flange 180 of the clamp and their overlying relation to the panel flanges 164 is shown, as are the positions of the studs 146 formed in the bracket legs 142. Fig.5 shows the positioning of the top floor supports 122 in position of use with the fasteners 132 in place, and shows that the nested or interlocking relation of the square elements provides a secure corner. Figs. 8 and 9 show the sectional views of the support units 122 in position over the upper portion 112 of the column 100. Referring now to Fig.10, there is shown the provision of a plurality of columns 100 supporting brackets 140 which form the intermediate support columns and top brackets 114 for the floor panels 32, 32a. A perforated or louvred top panel having openings 36 therein for discharge of air is shown as forming an air outlet into the room above the floor. In addition, there are imperforate lower floor panels 46 in place, positioned by the columns 100, said panels being arranged next to each other except for a void space or opening partially defining the isolated passage which is defined by the building structure floor 70, and a plurality of vertically extending panels 48 which form the side walls of the vertically extending air flow passage. Thus, an isolated plenum 72 is formed for the passage of air, with such plenum including both horizontally and vertically extending sections formed by a combination of floor and wall panels. It will be understood that air flow may be outwardly from the openings 36, or that in such arrangement, air flow may be reversed and the duct could serve as a return air duct. Importantly, both supply and return air may be provided in the same arrangement, merely by positioning the floor panels 46 or 42, for example, and appropriately positioning the wall panels 48 and selected floor panels. Fig.11 shows a similar arrangement with the plural columns 100 and their associated brackets 140 supporting the lower floor panels 46, with various vertical wall panels 48 being present to form a plenum generally designated 60 for the passage of these cables. This plenum lies between the lower floor panels 46 and is also defined by intermediate floor panels 42 where it extends horizontally and by the vertical wall panels 48 where these are provided, such panels 48 serving both as the side walls for the horizontally and vertically extending portions of the plenum or passage 60. The conductor cables 58 are shown to be physically supported by the floor 46 in keeping with code requirements they are also isolated from other conductive cables as has been pointed out. Fig.11 illustrates that other plenums, schematically designated 64 and 72, are present in the same structure but do not form a plenum which communicates with the plenum 60, and in fact is isolated therefrom according to the invention. Fig.12 shows the arrangement of a plenum generally designated 64 for conductors 62 which are shown as entering from both sides of the arrangement and are shown as being supported on the plural floor panels 42 forming the floor assembly 44. Vertically extending wall panels 48 define the portions of this plenum not defined by the floor and the undersides of the floor panels 32. The panel 66 which forms a part of the floor unit contains apertures schematically shown to permit passage of the cables therethrough so that the plenum 64 has an outlet for these cables. The lower floor elements again provide plenums which are isolated from the plenums just referred to, in keeping with the invention. Referring now to the additional construction details, and in particular to Figs. 2 and 3 through 9, the floor panels 136 may include a sheet metal clad layer 200 and a central core 202, of a particle board for example, and may be covered with carpeting not shown if this is desired. The parts may also have a lightweight concrete core, or use another type of filler. A modular floor construction is preferred, but is not absolutely necessary in keeping with the invention. The vertical column 100 is preferably made from a structural grade steel, with the wall and floor supports 122, 152 preferably being made from aluminium extrusions or formed steel elements. The brackets 114, 140 and the clamp units 170 as well as the pins 156, 178 are preferably made from steel although other materials may be suitable. The floor panels 162 and wall panels 184 are preferably made from steel or other rugged material providing resistance to rodents, and providing a substantially imperforate surface in respect to circulating air and the like. Inasmuch as codes usually require metal to metal electrical grounding, most or all parts preferably contain a corrosion resistant coating such as galvanizing or the like. The various panels illustrated may include gasket material of a conventional type such as foam or adhesively backed tape if a tighter air seal is desired. Rubber or other treated materials may be used for sound or vibration insulation if this consideration is important. The wall panels 84 may be single sheets as shown, or may be jointed or hinged along their horizontal centreline, for example, as will appear in connection with a description of Fig.15. Various pins, screws, and the like have been shown as preferred fasteners, it being understood that the various columns and brackets may be predrilled for this purpose, or may be assembled by drilling on the construction site. They may also be welded, soldered or brazed as appropriate. The adjusting screws, such as the stud 104 and the like, may be provided for a height adjustment or for levelling in a conventional manner, and adjustment may be provided at the top or bottom of the columns, or both, if desired. Referring now to Figs. 13 to 15, an alternate form of apparatus embodying the invention is shown. In Figs. 13 to 15, there are illustrated forms of construction which are preferred for meeting certain codes, and which may be desired or required in some applications, or which are preferred for ease of manufacture, or the like. While the construction shown in Figs. 13 to 15 is generally similar to that shown in Figs. 2 to 9, for example, the floor support apparatus generally designated 200 in Fig.13 is shown to include a column such as the column 202 having a lower portion 204 supported on a footing or plate 206, which may include stiffening dimples 208 or the like thereon, as well as holes or slots 210 to facilitate bolting to the floor or the like. The column 202 includes a tapped collar 212 at its upper end which serves to locate a threaded top extension 214 which terminates in a floor tile locating plate 216 affixed to the top thereof. This floor tile locating plate is adapted for vertical positioning by manipulation of the screw threads 214, and is thereafter intended to fixedly position floor tiles such as the tiles 218 shown received thereover. The tiles 218 have edge portions 220 which are adapted to engage an upwardly turned alignment tab 222 on the plate 216. As shown, the core of the floor panel 218 is made from a lightweight concrete material 224 surrounded by an exterior skin 226 of sheet metal or the like. Inasmuch as some codes require grounding for electrical safety, means to be described herein are provided for ensuring continuous electrical conductivity across the surface of the floor tiles and on to a suitable ground. Referring again to the plate 216, it will also be seen to include a number of vertically extending contoured locator pins 228 each having an enlarged head portion 230 and a shank 232 which is affixed to the plate 216. Referring again to Fig.13, it will be noted that a plurality of stringers generally designated 240 are shown to be provided and to extend in all four directions from a centre portion 242 of the column 202, being situated by bracket assemblies generally designated 244. While the constructional features of the bracket and stringer arrangement is similar to that shown in the earlier figures, certain constructional differences appear, and these are provided for ease of manufacturing or the like. Thus, each stringer 240 is shown to include an upper section 246 and a lower section 248 of identical, contoured cross section, preferably being made from an aluminium alloy or a rolled steel construction. As shown at 250, these channels may have their bight portions 252, 254 spot welded together as at 250 at spaced apart points along their length to provide a composite channel of generally H shaped cross section, but contoured so as to have sloping sidewalls to facilitate entry of the vertical wall portions it is intended to receive. Referring to other differences and similarities to the construction shown in Figs. 2 to 9, it will be noted in Fig.13 that a means in the form of individual panels 256 are provided to establish conductor support floors, and that these panels have notched out corner areas 258 where they meet the centre section 242 of the columns 202. At these column corner areas, the brackets 244 have cruciform sections in plan view and include a plurallity of outwardly extending legs 260, 262, which enter the open ends of the channels, and engage the under surfaces of the bight portions 254 so as to locate the channel or stringer against vertical displacement and properly align it with the column 202. Inasmuch as some electrical codes require the wireways formed by the floor panels 256 and stringers 246 to be free from sharp or upturned edges, a contoured floor panel holddown unit 264 is provided and shown to include a set screw 266 adapted to hold the unit 264 in place. Because of the cross sectional shape of the stringers 246, the holddown 264 has a generally keystone or trapezoidal shape when viewed in end section. These elements replace their counterpart bracket and clamp assemblies shown in Figs. 2 to 9, but serve the same functional purpose. Referring now to other different features of construction, the vertical walls generally designated 270 are shown to include an innermost, fixed vertical wall section 272 and an outermost, folding partition wall section generally designated 274. The wall panel such as a panel 272 has an axial extent corresponding in length to that of the holddown 264, and extends between the top surface 276 of the holddown 264 for example, and the downwardly directed opening in the lower portion 248 of the channel disposed there above. The inner wall element 272 terminates along a vertical end surface 278, and in use, this surface 278 abuts the counterpart end surface 280 of a folding vertical partition wall 274. Referring now to Fig.15, such a hinged partition wall is shown to be divided into upper and lower parts respectively designated 282, 284, each of which includes an outer contoured stiffener section 286, having an enlarged width foot 288 and a pair of spaced apart sidewalls 290, 292 which embrace therebetween a margin 294 of the panel proper 296. Along the lower margin 298 of the panel 296 is the female portion 300 of a hinge assembly generally designated 302 and shown to be formed by an enlarged contoured cylindrical end 304 in the upper margin 306 of the lower wall 284. In the manner of a piano hinge or like continuous hinge, the two co operating section 304, 300 provide a flexible, folding movement through approximately an 80 to 90 arc for these parts. A stiffener generally designated 308 for the lower section 306 includes sidewalls 310, 312 embracing the margin 314 of the main panel. A foot portion 316 or the like defines the lower end of the panel and is adapted for reception in the channel 320, for example. As will be appreciated, a vertically extending wall may be formed simply by folding one such wall forming assembly about its horizontal centreline, positioning it between adjacent stringers and pivoting the two wall sections about their central pivot point as the feet portion 288, 316 are moved into appropriate openings in the channels such as the channels 246, 320, for example. Merely pivoting the hinge into an open position locks the panels in place and provides an appropriate vertical wall. Referring again to the column 202, various formed sections may also be provided to ensure tight joints in this area, it only being necessary that means be provided on the column for removably positioning the stringers which in turn support floor panels or the like. Referring now to Fig.14, an enlarged vertical sectional view of the fastener for the floor tiles is shown. In this area, a hat section generally designated 330 is provided and includes an exterior shell 332 receiving a captive coil spring 334 therein. The radial flange 336 of the hat section is mechanically attached, as by crimping or spot welding, to the lower metal surface 338 of the panel. Consequently, when assembling the floor tiles 218, it is only necessary to position a corner of the tile, such as the floor tile 218, in registry with the opening generally designated 340 therein and in overlying relation to the pin unit 228, following which pushing down on the tile serves to create an electrical and mechanical contact, with the head portion 230 being snugly received within the coil spring 334 and the fitting 332. Accordingly, a good electrical ground is provided in this area, as may be required by some codes. The exact constructional details of the bracket and wall and floor support panels may be further varied and still fall within the scope of the present invention. However, preferred forms thereof have been illustrated which provide relatively exact location, ease of assembly, interchangeability of parts in keeping with modular construction and simplicity of assembly. Safety and security have not been compromised, however, as many of the materials are rugged and self supporting, and when erected are extremely rigid, with the strength necessary to support a computer or other heavy floor load as well as having the rigidity necessary to support the dead load of cables or the like and to provide the required mechanical isolation. Referring again to Fig.14, it will be understood that, in lieu of using a mounting system having a fixed locator pin on the column structure and a spring connection forming a part of the panel, it is possible, and in some cases preferred, to provide the panel with a socket for a threaded fastener and to secure an exterior spring to the panel by means of the fastener so that the spring making contact with the column for rounding purposes extends outside of the panel instead of lying within it. Where, as in the embodiment of Fig.13, the floor panels are rigid, channels or stringers may not be required to support the panels. In such cases, a non loadbearing panel may be provided beneath the floor panel merely for locating the vertical sidewall panels. The panels 218 are shown as having a metal exterior with a concrete core, but it will be understood that any floor panel meeting a proper code will be acceptable. Referring now to the assembly of a typical modular floor support and conduit protection assembly, the preferred sequence involves following measurement and layout, placing the columns in their desired locations and fitting the lowermost set of support brackets over the columns, locating them as desired at a level height. Thereafter, the lowermost floor portion is constructed by installation of appropriate panels, leaving open spaces where vertical ducting is indicated. After the floor panels have been inserted, the clamps are positioned and locked in place. At this point, a rigid structure consisting of vertical columns and floor panels which is self sustaining has been produced. Next, vertical walls and the next level of brackets are positioned, with the vertical walls being held by installation of the channels or like supports 152 placed over them and locked in place by co operation of the lugs 146 and openings 148. Then, the second level of flooring is installed, leaving appropriate openings where desired, and the floor panels are again clamped in position as indicated. If no more floor panels are planned, then the vertical or side wall panels are held in position and the top brackets 114 placed over the tops of the columns following which the walls are positioned by positioning within the downwardly directed recesses in the top supports 122, which are then fastened by screws 132 with the brackets 114. At this point, the isolated passages or separate plenums have been established and the top floor panels are then installed as desired, with apertured panels being placed where indicated. During construction, after any one floor is positioned, cables may be pulled into the appropriate position prior to the next construction phase. Thereafter, all necessary cables are pulled to and through floor level for installation on the appropriate machines. For working purposes, various floor panels may be temporarily removed and replaced after wiring or other physical hook up is complete. The invention has been illustrated with relation to electrical connectors, but it is understood that water cooling, plumbing, or other lines or conductors of various kinds may also be supported by the floors of the invention, or may be supported by the building floor lying beneath the plural spaced apart conduit support floors positioned by the columns of the modular structure. Whereas the invention has been described as preferably comprising a series of superimposed floors with vertical walls defining passages extending vertically through the areas above such floors, it will be understood that, in some cases, floor areas need only be provided beneath areas on which electrical or other conductors will be positioned, and that effective conduits for these conductors may be made by a combination of floor panels underneath them, with wall panels along the other side of the floored in areas thus defined. Hence, the lower or intermediate floors need not be fully coextensive with each other or with the uppermost or work support floor. A very important feature of the invention is that, with the need for large diameter conduit being obviated, and with the need for electrical workmen installing and bending such conduit being elimianted, the construction of the computer room may be done in a single operation, with building progress not being required to be stopped between the time that the carpentry or floor construction portion of the installation is made and the electrical installation begun. In the past, it was sometimes necessary to build a portion of the computer support floor, then await completion of intermediate electrical work by electricians, following which the mechanical work on the floor could be completed. According to the present invention, the need for such step by step construction is avoided.
