# An anti log power amplifier.

## Abstract
An anti log power amplifer for energizing a reversible electric motor 30 of an electrically assisted power steering system for an automotive vehicle. The power amplifier has a preamplifier 40 which amplies the output signal of a torque sensor 22 detecting the torque applied to the vehicle s steering wheel, an antilog signal generator 44 exponen tially modifying the amplified output signal, a pulse width modulator 46 converting the exponentially modified signal to a pair of complementary pulse width signals and a pair of bridged power amplifiers 48, 50 for energizing the revers ible electric motor 30 in response to the complementary pulse width signal. The bridged power amplifiers 48, 50 are further responsive to the exponentially modified signal for increasing the electrical power delivered to the reversible electric motor under high torque loads.
