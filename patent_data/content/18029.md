# Method and device for slide hopper multilayer coating.

## Abstract
A method and device for slide hopper multilayer coat ing, that aims to reduce or prevent the formation of beaded edges of the layers of coating composition as said layers slide down along the slide surfaces of the slide hopper coating head and as they are applied to a moving web material, wherein at least the upper layer formed through a delivery slot 31 of the slide hopper coater is coated at a width I₂ that exceeds the width I₁ of an other, lower layer formed through a delivery slot 30 of the hopper.
