# Planar resistance heating element.

## Abstract
A planar resistance heating element with PTC characteri stics includes a resistive body layer 14 formed of a crystalline resin containing electrically conductive particles and disposed between at least a pair of electrodes 13 1, 13 2 on an insulating substrate 11 . A phenolic resin layer 16 or a denatured phenolic resin layer with an elastomer resin added is disposed on the resistive body layer 14 in covering relation to the entire surface thereof. An insulating protective film 22 of resin may be disposed on the covering layer with an adhesive layer 21 interposed therebetween, and an adhesive layer 23 may be disposed on an outer surface of the insulating protective film 22 for attachment to an object to be heated
