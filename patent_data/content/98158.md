SCHEME IIIEMI15.1 Wherein R1. R2, R3. m and n have the meaning given to Formula 1. The reaction of substituted chloronitrobenzene 13 with substituted phenol 14 proceeds in the presence of base at elevated temperature to give the substituted nitroether 15 . The reduction of nitroether 15 to aniline 9 can be achieved under hydrogen atmosphere using a heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst. Suitable catalyst includes platinum or palladium on carbon orRaney nickel. The pressure ranging from 20 100 PSI at ambient temperature can be applied. Suitable, solvents include aromatic hydrocarbon or alcohol.The reduction of nitroether 15 to aniline 9 can also be achieved by chemical method using the procedure of E. Enders, et. al., GB A 1,456,964. The intermediates such as substituted chloronitrobenzene and substituted phenol are available commercially or may be prepared by well known method from chemical literature.

The compounds contemplated in this invention may be employed as insecticides according to methods known to those skilled in the art.Pesticidal compositions containing the compounds as the active toxicant will usually comprise a carrier and or diluent. either liquid or solid. Suitable liquid diluents or carriers include water. petroleum distillates. or other liquid carriers with ot without surface active agents. Liquid concentrates may be prepared by dissolving one of these compounds with a nonphytotoxic solvent such as acetone, xylene, nitrobenzene. cyclohexanone or dimethyl formamide and dispersing the toxicants in water with the aid of suitable surface active emulsifying and dispersing agents. The choice of dispersing and emulsifying agents and the amount employed is dictated by the nature of the composition and the ability of the agent to facilitate the dispersion of the toxicant.Generally. it is desirable to use as little of the agent as is possible. consistent with the desired dispersion of the toxicant in the spray so that rain does not re emulsify the toxicant after it is applied to the plant and wash it off the plant. Nonionic, anionic. or cationic dispersing and emulsifying agents may be employed. for example. the condensation products of alkylene oxides with phenol and organic acids. alkyl aryl sulfonates, complex ether alcohols. or quaternary ammonium compounds. In the preparation of wettable powder or dust or granulated compositions, the active ingredient is dispersed in and on an appropriately divided solid carrier such as clay. talc. bentonite.diatomaceous earth. or fullers earth. In the formulation of the wettable powders the aforementioned dispersing agents as well as lignosulfonates can be included. The required amount of the toxicants contemplated herein maybe applied per acre treated in from 1 to 200 gallons or adore of liquid carrier and or diluent or in from 5 to 500 pounds of inert solid carrier and or diluent. The concentration in the liquid concentrate will usually vary from 10 to 95 percent by weight and in the solid formulations from 0.5 to 90 percent by weight. Satisfactory sprays. dusts. or granules for general use contain from 1 4 to 15 pounds of active toxicant per acre. The pesticides contemplated herein prevent attack by insects upon plants or other material to which the pesticides are applied, and they have rel at ively high residual toxicity. With respect to plants. they have a high margin of safety in that when used in sufficient amount to kill or repel the insects. they do not burn or injure the plant. and they resist weathering which includes wash off caused by rain, decomposition by ultraviolet light. oxidation, or hydrolysis in the presence of moisture or. at least, such decomposition, oxidation, and hydrolysis as would materially decrease the desirable pesticidal characteristic of the toxicants or impart undesirable characteristics, for instance, phytotoxicity. to the toxicants. The toxicants are so chemically inert that they are now compatible with substantially any other constituents of the spray schedule. and they may be used in the soil, upon the seeds. or the roots of plants without insuring either the seeds or roots of plants.Mixtures of the active compounds may be employed if desired as well as combinations of the active compounds of this invention with other biologically active compounds or ingredients. The following examples illustrate the best node presently contemplated for the practice of the invention Example 1 Preparation of 4 2,4 dimethylphenoxy 3,6 dimethvl 5 chloronitrobenzene .

representative examples of the compounds were evaluated to determine their pesticidal activity against certain insects, including a caterpillar and a beetle.The compounds were also tested for phytotoxicity on important economic crops including bean, soybean, corn, tomato and cotton. The compounds were further evaluated for mammalian toxicity. Suspensions of the test compounds were prepared by dissolving one gram of compound in 50 milliliters of acetone in which had been dissolved 0.1 gram 10 percent of the weight of compound of an alkylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol surfactant, as an emulsifying or dispersing agent. The resulting solution was mixed into 150 milliliters of water to give roughly 200 xiililiters of a suspension containing the compound in finely divided form. The thus prepared stock Suspension contained 0.5 percent by weight of compound the test concentrations in parts per million by weight employed in the tests described hereinbelow wete obtained by appropriate dilutions of the stock suspension with water.The test procedures were as follows Southern Arm worm Leaf Spray Bait Test Larvae of the southern armyworm Saodoptera eridania, Cram. . reared on Tendergreen bean plants at a temperature of 80 5 F. and a relative humidity of 50 5 percent. constituted the test insects. The test compounds were formulated by diluting the stock suspension with water to give a suspension containing 500 parts of test compound per Tendergreen bean plants of standard height and age were placed on a revolving turntable and sprayed with 100 110 milliliters of test compound formulation by use of a DeVilbiss spray. gun set at 40 psig air pressure. This application, which lasted 25 seconds, was sufficient to wet plants to run off. As a control, 100 110 milliliters of a water acetone emulsifier solution containing no test compound were also sprayed on infested plants. When dry, the paired leaves were separated and each one was placed in a 9 centimeter Petri dish lined with moistened filter paper. Five randomly selected larvae were introduced into each dish and the dishes wer e closed.The closed dishes were labeled and held at 80 85 F. for three days. Although the larvae could easily consume the whole leaf within twenty four hours, no more food was added. Larvae wblcb were unable to move the length of the body, even upon stimulation by prodding, were considered dead. Percent mortality was recorded for various concentration levels. Mexican Bean Beetle Leaf Spray Test Fourth instar larvae of the Mexican bean beetle Epilachna varivestis, Muls. , reared on Tendergreen bean plants at a temperature of 800 50 F. and 50 5 percent relative humidity, were the test insects. The test compounds were formulated by diluting the stock suspension with water to give a suspension containing 500 parts of test compound per million parts of final formulation. Potted Tendergreen bean plants of standard height and age were placed on a revolving turntable and sprayed with 100 110 milliliters of test compound formulation by use of a Devilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig air pressure. This application, which lasted 25 seconds, was sufficient to wet plants to run off. As a control, 100 110 milliliters of a water acetone emulsifier solution containing no test compound were also sprayed on infested plants. When dry, the paired leaves were separated and each was placed in a 9 centimeter Petri dish lined with moistened filter paper.Five randomly selected larvae were introduced into each dish, and the dishes were closed. The closed dishes were labeled and held at a temperature of 800 50 F., for three days. Although the larvae could easily consume the leaf within 24 to 48 hours, no more food was added. Larvae which were unable to move the length of the body, even upon stimulation, were considered dead.Tobacco Budworm and Cotton Bollworm Leaf Spray Bait Test Second instar larvae of the tobacco budworm weighing about 4.5 mg Heliothis virescens, F. and the cotton boliworm weighing about 2.5 mg Heliothis zea, Boddie , obtained commercially and reared on artificial diet at a temperature of 800f50F and a relative humidity of 60 5 percent, constituted the test insects. Using a procedure similar to the above, but substituting cotton plants for snapbeans, treated and dried cotton leaves were introduced into 9 cm Petri dishes which were organized in to groups of 10 dish sets. One randomly selected larvae was introduced into each dish of a ten dish set and the dishes were closed. The closed dishes were labelled and held at 800 S F for five days. The biological properties of certain representative examples of the compounds of this invention are set forth In Table II below.
