# METHOD OF FABRICATING ALUMINA DOPED SILICA FIBRES

## Abstract
The method of fabricating alumina doped silica fibres al lows the production of silica and dopant with reactions be tween gaseous chemical compounds. Alumna is obtained from a reaction between oxygen and a low temperature vapor able organometallic compound. The optical fibres produced do not present the retraction index dip and exhibit low attenua tion.
