# Feed device for magnetic head.

## Abstract
This disclosure depicts a feed device for a magnetic head 16 applicable to an electronic still camera or a reproducer in an electronic camera system wherein a subject is pure electronically still photographed and recorded in a rotating magnetic disc 101 , and the reproducing of an image is carried out by a television system or a printer. The feed device for a magnetic head 16 utilizes a planetary gear reduction mechanism 22 22A,22B 24,26,28, 30,32,34,36,38 56 to obtain a high reduction ratio, whereby a head carriage 14 carrying the magnetic head 16 is finely fed. The planetary gear reduction mechanism comprises a sun gear 22 22A,22B connected to a rotary driving source 12 a stationary internal gear wheel 24 disposed concen trically with the sun gear 22 22A,22B therearound a rotary internal gear wheel 28 for the output disposed concentrical ly with the stationary internal gear wheel 24 at least one first planetary gear 26 being in mesh with the stationary internal gear wheel 24 as well as the sun gear 22 22A,22B at least one second planetary gear 32 being in mesh with the rotary internal gear wheel 28 as well as the sun gear 22 22A,22B and an arm member 34 for rotatably support ing said first and second planetary gears 26,32 so that the planetary gears can revolve respectively around the sun gear 22 22A,22B . The rotary internal gear wheel 28 for the output is connected to the head carriage 14 carrying the magnetic head 16 through the rotationlinear movement converting mechanism 40,42,44,46,48 and performs the fine feed of the magnetic head 16 , e.g. by 100 Âµm with high accuracy.
