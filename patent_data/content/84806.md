# Control system for diesel powered refrigeration plant.

## Abstract
A control system turns a diesel engine on and off to pow er a refrigeration plant, based on temperature requirements. The thermal content of the refrigeration plant and the food itself are used to maintain the required cold condition within a preset temperature range. The desired temperature limits are preset, and when these limits are exceeded, a first timer is set for a de sired delay based on the thermal content of the refrigeration plant and food , during which the engine is off delay times of up to one hour are usual. In a preferred embodiment, at the end of this delay time, the first timer will activate glow plugs in the engine. Simultaneously with turning on the glow plugs, a second timer is actuated to start the engine after a short delay. During the delay period set by the first timer, the diesel engine will be off, and hence, the control system saves diesel fuel and reduces engine maintenance.
