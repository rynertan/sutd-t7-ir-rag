# A process for preparing high surface area iron cobalt Fischer Tropsch slurry catalysts.

## Abstract
Slurried high surface area Fe Co spinels which are fully reduced carburized provide exceptionally high activity and selectivity in the conversion of CO H₂ to alpha olefins. These iron cobalt catalysts maintain good activity and selectivity under low pressure reaction conditions and comprise unsup ported Group IA or IIA metal salt promoted Fe Co spinels. They exhibit a single phase powder X ray diffraction pattern isostructural with Fe₃O₃ and possess a BET surface area greater than 5 m² g and an Fe Co ratio of 4 1 or more.
