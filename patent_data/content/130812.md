# Apparatus for controlling gear changing operation in automatic transmission.

## Abstract
A method of controlling gear changing in an automatic transmission having a gear transmission 6 actuatable by a gear changing actuator assembly 5 controlled by an electron ic control system 9 . When operating the gear changing actua tor assembly 5 for changing gear, an interval of time which elapses after the gear changing actuator assembly 5 is oper ated is measured with a timer, and the measured interval of time is compared with a preset interval of time. When a lock in the automatic transmission 6 is detected,by the fact that the gear changing operation is not completed within the preset in terval of time, the gear changing actuator assembly 5 is oper ated to restore the gear position or a neutral position which originally existed.
