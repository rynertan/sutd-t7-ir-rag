## Description
TITLE OF TAE INVENTION PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION USEFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPERCHOLESTEREMIABACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has long been known that certain diseases, such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, may be caused by the presence of too high a cholesterol level in the blood plasma and there have been many attempts to provide a medicament formulation for oral administration to reduce this cholesterol level. A number of pharmacological mechanisms have beenpostulated as usable to reduce cholesterol in the body. The binding of cholesterol itself into a non depositable form by e.g. phytosterols has been tried. Certain phenoxyalkanoic acids e.g. chlorphenoxy isobutyric acid CPIB and its esters1 or halofenate reduce the high density lipoproteins in which cholesterol is bound in rats and thus reduce blood cholesterol in that. species, but are not particularly effective in humans who have the cholesterol associated with low density lipoproteins. Attempts have also been made to block the synthesis of cholesterol. The rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis is known to the action of the enzyme 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase hereinafter HMG CoA reductase A number of compounds have been reported to inhibit this enzyme but their activity for the most par have been too weak to show much effect. Recently, Endo et al., Antibiotics, 1346 48, 29 1976 , have reported that 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8a hexahÅarO 7 methyl 8 2 3,4,5,6 tetrhydro 4 hydroxy 6 oxo 2H pyran 2 yl ethyl l naphthy 2 methyl butanoate, known as ML 2363 , reduced serum cholesterol levels in the acutely treated rat. The same group of workers have shown, Eur. J. Bio Chem. 77 1977 , that this compound is a very potent inhibitor of the reductase enzyme.In fact, the ED50 in the inhibition test has been found to be of the order of 1018 This was the first inhibitor of such potency to be reported. However, Bensch et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 247 254, 82 1978 report that they had found no effect on serum sterol levels compared with fed or fasted controls.Furthermore, Bensch et al., observed no change in either liver or liver microsomal cholesterol concentration. Bensch et al., demonstrated a marked increase in HMG CoA reductase, as observed in fed rats three hours following the administratio of ML 236B. The increased HMG CoA reductase activity found in rats and fibroblasts treated with 1,2,3,7,8,8a hexahydro 7 methyl 8 2 3,4,5,6 tetrhydro 4 hydroxy 6 oxo 2H pyran 2 yllethayll l naphthyI 2 methyl butanoate suggests that the production of HMG CoA reductase may be induced and, therefore, produces an increase in enzyme protein synthesis.The induction of this enzyme indicates that as the number of active molecules of HMG CoA reductase was reduced by the competitive inhibitor, 1,2,3,7,8 ,8a hexahydro 7 methyl S 2 3,4,5,6 tetrhydro 4 hydroxy 6 oxo 2H pyran 2 yl ethyl l naphthyl 2 methyl butanoate, the cell responds by increased synthesis of the enzyme protein in order to maintain a basic rate of sterol biosynthesis. More recently, Monaghan et al., have described the isolation from fermentation related compounds, e.g. MSD 803, described below, which are even more potent inhibitors of the enzyme and Willard et al., have described related synthetic compounds which also are potent inhibitors of the enzyme. These, together with the Endo et al , compounds form a unique class of HG CoA reductase inhibitors withED50 of less than 10 6 Both these compounds are described below. Still another pharmacological method which has bee tried for the lowering of blood cholesterol is oral ingestio of bile acid sequestrants compounds, usually cationic polymers, which will bind the bile acids into a non reabsorable form in the gastronintestinal tract, thus forcing the liver to extract cholesterol from the blood for oxidation to bile acids. This often results in increased synthesis of cholesterol to compensate. None of these methods have resulted in really significantly major reductions in blood cholesterol, sufficient to afford an effective atherosclerosis treatment. Some attempts have been made to combine various agents. Various bile acid sequestrants of different chemical structure have been reported. Coadministration of CPIB with a bile acid sequestrant has resulted in some increase in the lowering Howard, U.S. patent 3,846,541 but the results of these experiments were cholesterol level reductions insufficient to be an effective treatment of hypercholesteremia.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION I have found that the co administration of certain specific synthesis inhibitors with certain bile acid sequestrants, as defined below, results in a major reduction in cholesterol levels, a reduction above and beyond what one would expect from the addition of the effects of one treatment to the effects of the other which is of such magnitude up to 80 as to make this an effective treatment of hyper cholesteremia. A treatment which lowers cholesterol levels by 30 does not bring most patients down to a normal cholesterol level. A reduction of 80 represents a treatment which is useful for even the most severe cases of hypercholesteremia. The synthesis inhibitors are those which operate at the HMG CoA reductase level with an ED50 in one or both of the standard tests less than 10 The inhibitory activity of these compounds and the biosynthesis of cholesterol has been measured by two methods. The experimental method A has been realized in vitro by the method of H.J.Knauss et al., J. Biol. Chem., 234, 2835, 1959 and the activity was expressed as the molar concentration I50 M necessary for the inhibition of 508 of the enzymatic activity.The experimental method B was the method of A.A. Kandutsch, et al., J. Biol. Chemi, 2Z8 8403 1973 for measuring the quantity of C14 cholesterol biosynthesis from acetic acid c14 in mouse L cells. The activity is expressed as the molar concentration 150 M necessary for inhibition of 50 of the biosynthesis of cholesterol. The synthesis inhibitors which meet the criterion of ED50 less than 10 6 comprise those described respectively by Endo et al., those described byMonaghan et al., and those described by Willard et al., cited above, of which the preferred species is one or those described by Monaghan. The bile acid sequestrants used in the compositions of this invention are those pharmaceutically acceptable cation polymers, described below, which bind bile acids in the gastro intestinal tract so that they cannot be reabsorbed by the in testines and are excreted in the faeces. Of those describe, the greatly preferred species is cholestyramine, a quarternize polystyrene polyvinyl benzene coplymer. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the treatment of hypercholesteremia and to pharmaceutical compositions having marked hypocholesteremic activity. The compositions of the present invention have been found to act synergistically in producing a marked reduction in the cholesterol level in plasma. The compositions comprise two components and the treatment involves the co administration of these components. Component A is a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor acting at the HMG CoA reductase level with an ED50 in the inhibition test using the method described by Beg, Stonik,Brewer and Bryan 1977 FEBS Letters 80 123 to 129 using enzymes prepared as described by Kleinsek, Rangatham andPorter 1977 Pr . Nat. Acad. Sci. 74 1431 to 1435 , of no more than 10 6. Component B is a polymeric anion exchange resin. A. The Cholesterol Synthesis Inhibitors 1. Compactin RL 236 B Endo et al., have described U.S. 3,983,140, issuedSeptember 28, 1976 and West German Offenlegungschift 2,748,825, whose disclosures are presently incorporated herein by reference compounds of the formula I and the corresponding open hydroxy acids of formula I EMI5.1 wherein R is hydrogen atom, hydroxy group or the 2 methylbutyryloxy group OCOCH CH3 CH2CH3J andR1 is hydrogen, alkyl or phenacyl or benzyl both optionally substituted by alkyl, alkoxy or halogen the group 1 n M where M is a metal and n is its valency or the group AH where A is an amino acid wherein alkyl contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms and b a pharmacologically acceptable grade of certain basic non toxic anion exchange resin which are described hereinafter. The preferred compound of this type is the case wherein R in formula I above is 1 OCOCH CH3 CH2CH3 having the chemical designation 1,2,3,7,8,8a hexahydro 7 methyl 8 2 3,4,5,6 tetra hydro 4 hydroxy 6 oxo 2H pyran 2 ylJethyl l naphthyl 2 methyl butanoate, and the structural formula II or the corresponding open lactone ring compounds having the general formula II EMI6.1 EMI7.1 wherein R1 is as described above.These products are isolated from a fermentation of amicroorganism of the genus Penicillun, as described in said Endo et al., patent. The compound II has been give the name compactin 2. MSD 803 Another group of related compounds with even more potent activity of the same type have been described byMonaghan, Albert Hoffman and Albers Schoberg. They are products from the cultivation of a micro fungus of the species Aspergillus and have been identified as compounds of the formula EMI7.2 or its corresponding free hydroxyacid formEMI8.1 as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the latter and lower alkyl and substituted alkyl esters of the latter in which the possible substituent is phenyl, dimethylamino or acetylamino. The lactone of the above structure, or its free hydroxy acid form of the above structure, has been designation MSD 803.Although closely related to the compactin of Endo et awl., the MSD 803, of Monaghan et al., is a much more active compound and is the preferred species of cholesterol synthesis inhibitor in the compositions of this invention The following description is extracted from said Monaghan et al., application. The compounds are prepared by cultivating a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus and then recoverin said compounds of this invention from the cultured broth.Based upon taxonomic studies, this Aspergillus, isolated and identified as a hitherto undescribed microorganism, has ben designated MF 4833 in the culture collection of Mercy andCo., Inc. Rahway, NJ and a culture thereof has been placed on permanent deposit with the American Type Culture Collectior 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, and has been assigned accession No.ATCC No. 20541 deposition date May 31, 1979 . Another sample, of a similar organism, designated MF 4S45 in the Merck culture collection, has likewise been placed on deposit with the American Tp Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852 and has been given the accession number ATCC 20542, deposition date May 31, 1979 . The latter organism is the one giving the better yield. Other organisms of the genus Aspergillus, including mutants of the above ones are also capable of producing MSD803. The morphological characteristics of the micro organisms MF 4833 and MF 4845 have been found to be those of the genus Aspergillus. Using the criteria specified in the standard authority Manual of the Aspergilli , Charles Thom and Kenneth B. Rasper, published by the Williams and Wilkins Company, Baltimore, Md., 1945, and by comparison with know species, it has been determined that both strains are Aspergillus terreus. The culture of these organisms to produce MSD803 is carried out in aqueous media such as those employed for the production of other fermentation products. Such media contain sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts assimilable by the microorganism.c c In general, carbohydrates such as sugars, for ,,,example, glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, xylose, man nitol and the like and starches such as grains, for example, oats, ryes, cornstarch, corn meal and the like can be used either alone or in combination as sources of assimilable mecarbon in the nutrient medium. The exact quantity of the carbohydrate source of sources utilized in the medium depend in part upon the other ingredients of the medium but, in general, the amount of carbohydrate usually varies between about 19 and 6 by weight of the medium. These carbon sources can be used individually, or several such carbon sources may be combined in the medium.In general1 many proteinaceous materials maybe used as nitrogen sources in the fermentation process Suitable nitrogen sources include for example, yeast hydrolysates, primary yeast, soybean meal, cottonseed flour, hydrolysates of casein, corn steep liquor, distiller s solubles or tomato paste and the like. The sources of nitrogen either alone or in combination, are used in amounts ranging from about 0 2 to 6 by weight of the aqueous medium. Among the nutrient inorganic salts which can be incorporated in the culture media are the customary salts capable of yielding sodium, potassium, ammonium calcium, phosphate, sulfate, chloride, carbonate, and like ions. Also included are trace metal such as cobalt, manganese, iron and magnesium. It should be noted that the media described in the detailed procedure below are merely illustrative of the wide variety of media which may be employed, and are not intended to be imitative Specifically, the carbon sources us in the culture media to produce MSD803 included dextrose, dextrin, oat flour, oatmeal, molasses, citrate, soybean oil, glycerol, malt extract, cod liver oil, starch, ethanol, figs, sodium ascorbate and lard oil. Included as nitrogen sources were peptonized milk, autolyzed yeast, yeast RNA, tomato paste, casein, primary yeast, peanut meal, distillers solubles, corn steep liquor, soybean mean, corn meal, NZ amine, beef extract, aspargine, cottonseed meal and ammonium sulfate. The major ionic components were Cacao3, KH2P04, MgS04 .7H2O and NaCl and small amounts of CoC12. 6H,O and traces of Fe, Mn, Mo,B and Cu were also present. The fermentation is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 200 to 370C. however, for optimum results it is preferable to conduct the fermentation at temperatures of from about 220 to 30 DC. The pH of the nutrient media suitable for growing the Aspergillus cul ture and pro ücing MSD803 can vary from out 6.0 to 8.0. Although the compound is produced by both surface and submerged culture, it is preferred to carry out the fermentation in the submerged state. A small scale fermentation is conveniently carried out by inoculating a suitable nutrient medium with theAspergillus culture and, after transfer to a production medium, permitting the fermentation to proceed at a constand temperature of about 280C. on a shaker for several days. The fermentation is initiated in a sterilized flask. of medium via one or more stages of seed development. The nutrient medium for the seed stage may be any suitable combination of carbon and nitrogen sources. The seed flask is shaken in a constant temperature chamber at about 280C. for 2 days, or until growthis satisfactory, and some of the resulting growth is used to inoculate either a second stage seed or the production medium.Intermediate stage seed flasks, when used, are developed in essentially the same manner, that is, part of the contents of the flask from the last seed stage are used to inoculate the production medium The inoculated flasks are shaken at a constant temperature for several days, and at the end of the incubation period the con tents of the flasks are centrifuged or filtered. For large scale work, it is preferable to conduct the fermentation in suitable tanks provided with an agitator and a means of aerating the fermen tation medium. According to this method, the nutrient mediua is made up in the tank and sterilized by heating at temperatures of up to about 1200C. Vpon cooling, the sterilized medium is inoculated with a previously grown seed of the producing culture, and the fermentation is permitted to proceed for a period of time as, for example, from 3 ta 5 days while agitating and ar aerating the nutrient medium and maintaining the temp erature at about 28 C. This method of producing MSD803 is particularly suited for the preparation of large quantities. The compound is conveniently isolated from the fermentation broth as the lactone. However, MSD803 is present in the fermentation broth largely as the hydroxycarboxylate open lactone form. It is possible to isolate this form and its salts. Alternatively, the lactone form can be hydrolyzed with bases such as NaOH to yield the corresponding salts such as the sodium salts. The use of bases with the pharmaceutically acceptable cations affords salts of these cations. Careful acidification of the salts affords the hydroxy acid form. Conversely, the hydroxy acid can be con verted to the lactone form at acidic pH. Opening the lactone, under catalysis, with methanol, ethanol, propanol, or butanol or with phenyl, dimethylamino, or acetylamino alkanols yields the corresponding esters of this invention. The physico chemical properties of MSD803 in its lactone form are summarized as follows 1. Melting point 170 171 2. 2 Molecular Weight 404 mass spectrum 3.

This value has been obtained by measuring at the sodium D line wave length.On the basis of these and other data, the structure of the product believed with a considerable degree of certainty to have the chemical structure III above The preparation of MSD 803 and its salts and esters can be illustrated by the following Fermentation The medium used in each step of the fermentation comprised Corn steep liquor 5 g Tomato paste 40 g Oat Flour 10 g Glucose 10 g Trace element solution 10 ml Distilled water 1000 ml adjusted to pH 6.8 with sodium hydroxide. The trace element solution comprised FeS04 7H20 lg MnS04. 4H20 lg CuCl2.2H2O 25mg CaC12 lOOmg H3B04 56mg NH4 6 Mo7O24.4H2O 19mg 2H SO4.7H2O 200mg distilled water 1 liter All mediums were checked for sterility before innoculation with a microorganism. rz To a 250 ml non baffled Erlenmeyer flask was charged 40 ml of medium and the contents of one tube of lyophillized organism MF 4833. It was then shaken for 24 28 C on a rotary shaker at 220 rpm. New flasks where then charged with 40 ml of medium and I ml of the first flasks contents and were shaken an additional 24 hours at 280C. A 2 liter flask was then charged with 400 ml of med ium and 10 ml of the second stage fermentation mixture and this too was shaken for 24 hours at 280 C. A 200 gallon stainless steel fermentation vat was then charged with 501 liters of a medium comprising lactose 2 wt vol distiller solubles 1.58 wt vol autolyzed yeast 0.5 wt vol Polyglycol P2000 0.25 wt vol whose pH was adjusted to 7.0 This was sterilized 15 minutes at 1210 C. One liter of the third stage above was then charged and the mixture was incubated at 130 rpm at 280C for 96 hours with an air flow of 10 cfm. B. isolation of MSD803 About 37.5 lbs. 3 4 bag of a silicaceous filter aid was added to 110 gal. whole broth from the culture of MF 4833 described above and the mixture was filtered through an 18 inch filter press. The clarified filtrate, pH 6.6 was adjusted to pH 4.0 by careful addition of 450 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and extracted by agitation with about one third volume 36 gal. of ethyl acetate. After separation, the upper solvent layer was removed, and the water phase again extracted with ethyl acetate 38 gal. in a similar fashion. After separation, the two extracts were combined and back washed by agitation with about twelve gallons of water.After separation, the ethyl acetate solution was concentrated under vacuiun at a temperature below 300C, first in a stirred kettle, and finally in a rotary vacuum evaporator to a residual volume of slightly less than one gallon. Approximately 1 gal. 3800 ml of ethyl acetate concentrate from the preceding extraction was further concentrated in a rotary evaporator ca 10 mm, 400C bath tole syrup and was then concentrated twice more, after of about one liter of methylene chloride in two portions, to free the syrup of polar solvent. The final oil of about 300 ml which contained about 250 g of solids by dry weigth determination, was made up to about 750 ml with ethyl acetate methylene chloride 30 70 v v and 20,Q gr silica gel was added and mixed in to form a slurry This was layered over the top of a 14 cm by 36 cm column bed holding 2.5 kg of the same silica gel, in about 7.5 1 volume, which had been packed as a slurry in the same solvent mixture.Development with the same solvent was continued until 3 liters of effluent was taken off as forerun. Development with ethyl acetate methylene chloride 50 50 v v was begun, taking 800 ml effluent fractions. Twelve fractions were taken, then 100 ethyl acetate elution was begun, and after seven more fractions, 100 acetone elution was begun.Fractions four through twenty four were assayed for bio activity in the HMG CoA Reductase inhibition assay referred to in Example 1. Substantial activity was found in fractions 7 through 11. Peak activity was found in fraction 8. It was concentrated to an oil for further purification dry wt. by solids determination was 9.0 gm. Fraction 8 from the silica gel column was triturated with 50 ml methylene chloride and. filtered the dried filter cake weighed 4.9 gm. The filtrate was charged to a 2 inch I.D. by l meter long column filled with Sephadex LH 20 dextran gel Pharmacia swollen and equilibrated in methylene chloride, and the column was eluted with methylene chloride at a rate of 15 ml min. MSD803 is eluted between 0.64 and 0.81 column volumes. Solvent was removed from this peak leaving a slightly brown residue weighing approximately 0.290 gm. 213 mg. of this residue was taken up in 1.5 ml of CH2C12 CH3CN 65 35 , charged to a prepacked and equilibrated silica gel column EM LOBAR Size B and eluted with CH2C12 CH3CN 65 35 at 5 ml min.Evaporation of solvent from the peak eluting between 235 and 360 ml of eluant left 121 mg of crystalline product, m.p. 155 1600C. HPLC of this material on a EM RP 18 reverse phase analytical column E Merck HIBAR II,Cat. No. 906046 using 0.05M sodium phosphate pH 3.0 acetonitrile 45 55 as eluant at 2 ml min. showed a characteristic uv absorbing peak at .11 min. Eighty two mg of this material was recrystallized from 0.6 ml of absolute ethanol, then again from 0.4 ml of the same solvent to afford, after drying over night in a desiccator over P205, 40 mg of white feathery crystals.Analytical HPLC on the system described above gave a single sharp peak at 11 minutes elution time. After further recrystallizations, a melting point of 170 1710C was obtained. The product was identified by spectra, etc., as the lactone form of MSD803. This material, in the in vitro HMGCoA reductase test of Example 1 gave an 1C50 of 0.01 micrograms per milliliter.Preparation of Salts of MSD 803 To a solution of 40 mg the product ofExample 6 in 2 ml of ethanol is added I ml of aqueousNaOH 10 4 moles 1 equivalent . After one hour at room temperature, the mixture is taken to dryness in vacuo to yield the sodium salt of the free acid form of MSD803.

Other pharmaceuticalty acceptable salts are likewise prepared using equivalent qt antities of the appropriate base.Preparation of Free Hydroxy Acid of MSD803 The sodium salt produced in Example 7 is redissolved in Q ml of ethanol water 1 1 and added to 10 ml of lN Xydrochloric acid from which the liberated hydroxy acid is extracted with ethyl acetate.The latter solvent is washed once with water, dried and removed in vacuo with a bath temperature not exceeding 300. The hydroxy acid derived slowly reverts to the lactone on standing. Preparation of esters of MSD 803 To a solution of 4 mg of the product ofExample 6 in 1 ml of absolute ethanol is added 0.1 ml 0,1M sodium ethoxide in absolute ethanol. This solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour, is then diluted into water and extracted twice with water, the ethyl acetate dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate is removed in vacuo to yield the ethyl ester of MSD803.

REACTIONS IN FLOW SHEETS I IV 1. When R1, R2 or R3 is HO or bears a hydroxyl substituent, the HO group is etherified using a reagentR4X in a suitable solvent such as DMF and the like in the presence of a suitable base, preferably an alkali metal carbonate such as K2CO3, to give the corresponding etherR4O which can be carried through the remainder of the synthesis. If it is desired to remove R4 at a later synthesis step, R4 is chosen as an easily removable group such as CH3OCH2CH2OCH2 the MEM protecting group . The MEM group is removed readily by treatment with a Lewis acid catalyst such as ZnBr2 in a suitable solvent such as CH2C12 and the like. T hen the starting material is devoid of a hydroxyl group, step 1 is omitted. 2. Aldol Reaction. This can be run in several ways a The classical Aldol synthesis in which acetaldehyde is condensed with the starting benzaldehyde, the resulting F hydroxyaldehyde is acetylated with acetic anhydride and acetic acid is eliminated thermally to give the cor ing cinnamaldehyde b The directed Aldol condensation in which the anion of an appropriately N substituted ethylidenylimine, such as ethylidenecycldhexylimine and the like is condensed with the starting benzaldehyde at or below room temperature in an aprotic solvent, such as THF and the like, to afford a 8 hydroxy B phenylpropylidenylimine which, upon concomitant dehydration and imine hydrolysis in an acidic medium, such as dilute aqueous HC1, provides the corresponding cinnamaldehyde. c The use of a nucleophilic acetaldehyde eauivalent in which cis 2 ethoxyvinylithium, generated from cisl ethoxy 2 tri n butylstannylethylene, is condensed with startina benzaldehyde to give an allylic alcohol which is suF sequently rearranged, under suitable acidic conditions, to ti corresponding cinnamaldehyde. 3 Dianion Step. Reaction with the dianion of acetoacetic ester in a suitable aprotic solvent such as THF, dioxane and the like. 4 Reduction with NaBH4 in a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol and the like at or below room temperature. 5 Lactonization. Saponification by base e.g.NaOH in aqueous alcohol followed by acidification and cyclodehydration by heating in toluene.NOTE Steps 3, 4 and 5 are usually carried out sequentially without purification of compounds V and VI. 6 Separation of the cis and trans racemic mixtures by chromatography on silica gel or crystallizatibn. 7 Resolution of the trans racemate into its enantiomers by treating the trans lactone with either d or l methylbenzylamine to give the diastereomeric dihydroxy amides which are separated by chromatography or crystallization. Hydrolysis of each pure diastereomeric amide under basic conditions, such as ethanolic NaOH and the like, affords the corresponding enantiomerically pure dihydroxy acid which, upon lactonization, e.g., in refluxing toluene, provides the pure trans or trans enantiomer. Stereochemistry depends on the absolute stereochemistry of the diastereomeric amide from which it is derived. 8 Saponification with M OH where M is an alkali metal cation. 9 Careful acidification. 10 Mild hydrolysis 11 Nucleophilic opening of the lactone ring with an alcohol, R50H, in the presence either of a basic catalyst particularly the corresponding alkoxide, R50 , or an acidic catalyst such as an acidic ion exchange resin, e.g. Amberlite 120. 12 Hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Rhodium or Palladium on carbon. 13 Reaction with NaCN in a suitable solvent such as aqueous ethanol and the like. 14 Reduction with DIBAH in a aprotic solvent such as toluene, ether, THF and the like followed by work up with an aqueous acid such as 5 H2SO4 15 Aldol condensation with l tri n butyl stannyl propan 2 one. 16 Acylation with 2 bromoacetyl bromide. 17 Intramolecular Reformatsky reaction carried out for example, in the presence of activated zinc dust, cuprous bromide and diethylaluminum chloride. 18 Asylation with acetyl chloride. 19 Intermolecular Reformatsky reaction carried out with ethyl 2 bromacetate, for example, in the presence of the reagents indicated in step 17 above.

The Bile Acid Sequestrants The basis non toxic anion exchange resins, which are the bile acid sequestrants used in this invention, may be water soluble or water insoluble or may swell in the presence of water. It is preferred to use these resins in salt form, for example, as a salt with a non toxic inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, phosphorous acid or phosphoric acid. The resinous materials are used in fine particulate form and are preferably sieved so as to exclude oversize particles. 1. Cholestyramine particularly preferred type of basic non toxic anion exchange resin is that in which basic groups have been introduced into a copolymer of styrene with a small proportion of divinylbenzene. The copolymer is subject to chlormethylation and the product then treated with a tertiary amine, preferably a trialkylamine containing not more than 10 carbon atoms, so as to introduce basic quaternary ammonium groups. the styrene divinylbenzene copolymer preferably contains not more than 5 percent, preferably 1 4 percent of divinylbenzene. The extent of chlormethylation and hence the proportion of quaternary groups can be varied over quite wide limits. Such prodocts have a high molecular weight and an equivalent weight based upon the ammonium groups, of less than S00, of about 175 200. The most preferred synthetic, strongly basic anion exchange resin of this type is designated choles tyramine and contains quaternary ammonium functional groups which are attached to a styrene divinyl benzene copolymer. The main constituent is polystyrene trimethylbenzylammonium wit Cl ion, but it also contains divinylbenzene 28 and water 0 75 . Cross linkage 1 10. Particle size 50 100 mesh having the typified structure of main polymeric groupsEMI41.1 Compositions and methods for binding bile acids with cholestyramine are described in U.S. Patent NO. 3,383,821 and 3,308,020, which are herein incorporated by reference. 2. Colestipol A second type of basic non toxic anion exchange resin which may be used in the compositions and treatment of the invention are the water insoluble high molecular weight copolymers obtained from polyalkylene polyamines and epichlor ohydrin, glycerol 1,3 dichlorohydrin or an aliphatic bis epoxy compound such as 1,2 3,4 bis epoxybutane, bis epoxy propyl ether or an alpha, omega alkylene glycol. A preferred type of polyalkylene polyamine is a polyethylene polyamine and amongst the latter diethylenetriamine is the preferred material. Such compounds contain at least as many secondary amino groups as primary amino groups in the molecule.The preferred polymer of this type designated colestipol, is a copolymer of diethylenetriamine and l chloro 2,3 epoxypropane and may be regarded as Åa cross linked polymer of these two substances which is brought to a pH of approximately 4 with hydrochloric acid , then dialyzed and the dialyzed product dried. In the reaction products a proportion of the amino groups are quaternized and form chloride salts. 3. Esters of crosslinked polysaccharides A third type of resin consists of the omega dialkylaminoalkyl, the omega di hydroxyalkyl aminoalkyl and the omega morpholino alkyl ethers of cross linked polysaccharides, for example, of dextran, starch and sucrose cross linked with epichlorohydrin together with the non toxic salts of such ethers with acids. The dextrans are anhydroglucose polymers produced by the action of Leuconostoc mesenteroides upon aqueous solutions of sucrose.The copolymer of dextran and epichlorohydrin has from 10 to 35 of its weight of hydroxyl groups, based upon the dry substance, from 6 to 50 percent of said hydroxyl groups are replaced by groups of the formula RYO in which Y is an alkylene group having at least one but less than three carbon atoms and R is a dialkylamino group having at least two but less than five carbon atoms, said copolymer having an ion exchange capacity of 2 to 6 milliequivalents per gram of dry compound. Preferred compounds of this type are those containing 2 diethylaminoethyl, 2 dimethylaminoethyl, 2 die,thyl aminomethyl, di hydroxyethyl aminoethyl, di hydroxyethyl aminoethyl, ss morpholinoethyl and alpha morpholinomethyl groups. Such compounds are, for example, described in U.S. Patent No. 3,277,025, together ith their methods of production. The preferred salts of these compounds are the hydrochiorides. These compounds are insoluble in water but swell therein and have a water regain of from 1 to 50 grams per gram of dry compound. A preferred polymer of this type is dextran cross linked with epichlorohydrin which is subjected to after treatment with diethylaminoethyl halide in the presence of an aqueous alkali such as causti soda the product may be characterized as poly 2 diethylamino ethyl polyglycerylene dextran. 4 Ionenes A fourth type of basic non toxic anion exchange resin is the bile acid binding quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin having a linear backbone which is free from both branching and cross linking, comprising quaternized nitrogen atoms linked to each other through trimethylene groups. By the term linear backbone is meant that the polymer has only acyclic groups, i.e. trimethylene, linking the nitrogen atoms in a single continuous chain the polymer is free from branching when it has no repeating monomer units extending from the polymer backbone and it is free from cross linking when there is no joining of two linear backbones. The polymers are obtained by the polymerization of dihydro oxazine, reductive alkylation of the resulting polymer, followed by quaternization. Such compounds are for example described in U.S.Patent No. 4,098,726, together with their method of production. A preferred such polymer is designated poly methyl 3 trimethylammoniopropyl iminio trimethylene dihalide and has the structural formula EMI44.1 wherein X is a halide anion. This type of bile acid sequestrant includes water soluble quaternary ammonium linear show 2 polymers of monomes having the structural formulae EMI45.1 The nomenclature here employed, and in the claims, for the preferred polymer, which designates the quaternary nitrogen in the polymeric chain as iminio , is in accord with the nomenclature now in use by ChemicalAbstracts. The nomenclature sometimes used for this polymer elsewhere in the specification, including the illustrative experimental examples, which designates the quaternary nitrogen in the polymeric chain as imino , is in accord with that approved by IUPAC MacromolecularNomenclature Commission, as reported in Macromolecules, Vol. 6, No. 2, page 149 1973 . It will be appreciated that, with each such cationic ammonium group1 there is associated a chloride anion. In the above formulae, the symbols Y and Z independently represent an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or phenyl radical which may contain as substituents such groupings as amido, carboloweralkoxy, loweralkoxy, mono and dicyclic aryloxy, cyano, thioloweralkoxy, thiophenoxy, or lower alkoyl forming a ketonic group radicals, 5 and 6 membered cycloalkyl groupings, and, on the alkyl groupingsonlyt a nitro group, and on the phenyl radical only,, a halogen atom chlorine, bromine, fluorine andwSodine . The symbols Ecrand R6 independently represent a hydrogen, chloro, Rotorme, or lower alkyl or phenyl radical, having substituents as stated under the definition for Y and above The symbbsW stands for a divalent radical of the formula CH2 O n CH2 m The symbol T stands for a divalent radical of the formula CH2 p 0 n CH2 The symbol V stands for a divalent radical of a formula tCH2 p n CH2 2 In these last mentioned formulae, the small letter n represents one of the numbers 0 to 1 the small letter m represents one of the numbers 1 and 2 and the small letter p represents one of the numbers 2 and 3. The preferred water soluble polymers of this type are the linear homopolymers of diallyldimethylammonium chloride hereinafter also referred to as Such polymers are described, together with the method of preparation, in U.S. Patent 3,288,770, which is herein incorporated by reference. 5. Water Soluble Anion Exchange Resin Also included in the present invention are further compositions containing the cholesterol snythesis inhibitors and water soluble polymers which successfully bind bile acids. The water soluble polymers have certain very definite characteristics which serve to delineate those which are operative. They must have a molecular weight greater than 1500, although polymers having a molecular weight above 3000 are preferred as cholesterol blood level reducing agents. Such materials are not absorbed in the alimentary tract. The polymers must have a plurality of ionizable amines i.e., either quaternary amino groups, which are already ions, or amino groups sufficiently basic to form acid addition salts in contrast to pseudoamino groups such as amide nitrogen.Further, these amino groups must be suffic iently numerous in the polymer chain to make the equivalent weight based on titration of the amino groups less than 500. Finally, the polymer skeleton i.e., the fundamental atom chain of the polymer must be inert to degradation by digestive enzymes. Since the latter act principally by hydrolysis, this means that the polymer must be free of easily hydrolyzed amide, ester and the like, linkages. Above all, they must meet the in vitro test of binding at least 40 of glycocholic acid. Various polymeric substances of this type are useful according to the present invention. One such polymer, variously known as Acryloid CQ and Acrysol CQ, a linear acrylic type quaternary ammonium salt polymer having a molecular weight on the order of about 2,000,000, made by Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, Pa., is quite useful in reducing cholesterol blood levels. This polymer, structurally a straight carbon skeleton with ester side chains, the esters being from quaternary ammonium substituted alcohols, is soluble in water, and the water solution has a viscosity of 2500 to 5000 centipoises in 5 aqueous solution at room temperature and available from the manufacturer in an aqueous solution containing about 12 to 14 percent by weight of polymer. It has an eq 1ivalent weight, based on the ammonium groups, of about 350 to 360. Another polymer which is effective according to the present invention is Acrysol CA, a soluble tertiary amine salt available froin Rohm and Haas Company. Aside from the fact that this polymer is a tertiary amine salt rather than a quaternary ammonium salt, its properties in general are the same as those of Acrysol CQ. Its equivalent weight is of the order of 325. A further water soluble polymer of this type which is useful in cholesterol therapy according to this invention is polyethylenediamine, which has the structure CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH n and an average molecular weight of about 30,000. This polymer is available from the Borden Company, New York,N.Y. It has a very low equivalent weight, of the order of about 43, since each imine group is an active ionizable amine. Still another water soluble polymer useful in cholesterol blood level reduction according to the present invention is Separan CR70, made by the Dow Chemical Co.,Midland, Michigan. This material is a copolymer of acrylamide and vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride in a weight ratio of about 30 70, having an equivalent weight of about 302 and an average molecular weight of above 100,000. Still further examples of the above water soluble polymers are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,308,020, which is herein incorporated by reference. C. The Composition of this Invention The composition of this invention comprise 1 one or more cholesterol synthesis inhibitors acting at the HMG CoA reductase level with an ED50 less than 10 6M and 2 one or more polymeric anion exchange bile acid sequestrants, each especially of the types described above.The two components can also be coadministered in the method of this invention. The most preferred composition is that of compoundsIII and or III with cholestyramine. However, compositions of cholestyramine with compounds II and or II or IV and orIV are also important aspects of this invention. The compositions intwhich colestipol are used with, preferrably compound III and or III , but also II and or II and IV and or IV are also important aspects of this invention. As will be demonstrated hereinafter, the admixture of the cholesterol synthesis inhibiting compounds with the above non toxic anion exchange resins has a synergistic effect in the reduction of cholesterol values in plasma.To obtain the synergistic advantage from the compositions it is preferred to use mixtures of compound I or I to resin in the proportion of from lf to 1 1500 by weight. Resins of the above kinds are known to be capable of sequestering bile acids in the intestine and are then excreted in the feces. However, there is a wide variation amongst patients. The resins are, in any event, only moderate effective because the liver comprensatis to some degree by synthesizing more cholesterol. erol a The compositions of this invention are administered orally in the form of capsules, tablets and the like. It is usually desirable to use the oral route. Doses may be varied, depending on the age, severity, body weight and other conditions of human patients but daily dosage for adults is within a range of from about 2 mg to 2000 mg preferably 10 to 100 mg given in three or four divided doses. Higher doses may be favorably applied as required. With respect to the treatment of patients suffering from hypercholesteremia, it is reconmended that the active ingredients of the composition of the present invention be co administered as separate dosages or, preferably, as a unitary combination dosage. The dosage of the compounds of formula I or I may be from 1 to 25 mg kg day. That of the more potent compounds of formula III or III may be from 0.02 to 10 mg kg day. For compounds of formula IV, a dosage of 0.2 to 50 mg kg day is used.In terms of a 70 kg average weight human, the daily dosage ranges are 7 to 1750 mg of the compounds of Formula I or I , 1.4 to 700 mg of the compounds of formula III or III and 14 to 3500 mg of the compounds of formula IV The preferred usages are 1 2 mg kg day or 0.07 0.14 g day for I or I 0.2 0.5 mg kg day or 0.02 0.04 g day for III or III and 2 4 mg kg day or 0.14 0,3 g day for IV. The usage of the bile acid sequestrant resins, especially of cholestyramine, is 3.5 to 21 g day, preferrably 12 15 g day. For infants and children the weight must be taken into account, with a preferred dosage of 0.3 1.1 g kg. day. It is contemplated within the present invention that any of the dose ranges of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors recited above can be combined with any of the dose ranges recited above for bile acid sequestrants, The ratios of the insredients by weight thus vary from 1 0.08 to 1 15,000, for example from 1 0.08 to 1 266 or from l l to 1 15,, 000. The doses of the composition can be administered in one to. three equal daily doses. Preferred dosage compositions of this invention for one daily dose thus are 12 15 g of sequestrant resin and 0.7 to 0.14 g of compactin 0.02 0.04 g of methyl compactin or 0.14 0.3 g of the compounds of formula IV. Unit dosages of one half or one third this size are used for multiple daily doses. Protocol for Evaluating Combination of Compound II with Cholestyramine in Dogs Male beagles, ranging in weight from 7 to 14 kg. average 11 kg. , were fed a semi synthetic diet six weeks prior to the start of the experiment and serum cholesterol levels determined colorimetrically each week in order to obtain base line values for each dog. At the start of the treatment, animals were divided into three treatment groups.Group A 4 dogs received 25 mg. kg. day of compound II mixed in the diet. Group B 4 dogs received i2 a. dta day of cholestyramine mixed in the diet.Group C 5 dogs was the treated control. Treatment was for four weeks, and plasma cholesterol was determined two times per week. After four weeks a combination of compound II and cholestyramine was given to dogs in Groups A and B mixed in the diet at 25 mg. kg. and 12 g. dog day respectively for an additional four weeks. Cholesterol levels were determined two times per week during this period. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The lower curve, indicated by the solid line shows the results obtained with Group A receiving 25 mg. kg. day of compound II . There is a rapid reduction in plasma cholesterol level plateauing by four weeks at 36 of control. With Group B receiving 12 g. kg. day of cholestyramine shown by the dashed line, there is a reduction of 35 in plasma cholesterol after four weeks. The control dogs, Group C, shown in the upper curve with the dash and dot line have the same cholesterol levels after four weeks as at the start.Combining compound II and cholestyramine in the diets of groups A and B at 25 mg. kg. and 12 g. dog day respectively for an additional four weeks indicated by the arrow in Fig 1 results in further marked reductions. In Group A after four weeks on the combination there is a further reduction to 80 of the initial values. The results shown graphically in Fig. 1 are also shown in tabular form in Table I. Thus as is summarized in Table I, treating dogs for four weeks with compound II at 25 mg. kg. dog mixed in the diet Group A results in a decrease of plasma cholesterol ranging from 34 to 40 average of 35.6 . Treating dogs for four weeks smith cholestyramine at 12 g. dog day mixed in the diet Group B results in a decrease in plasma cholesterol ranging from 33 to 40 average of 35,38 , From this data it is expected that upon treating Group A dogs with cholestyramine at 12 g. dog day in combination with compound II there should be an additional 35.3 decrease in plasma cholesterol or an average of 53.4 mg. dl.after four weeks on the combination. It is found, however, that the plasma cholesterol level is reduced to an average of 27 mg. dl. or 67.2 range 65 76 with the combination as compared with compound IT alone. Similarly treating Group B dogs with compound II at 25 mg. kg. day in combination with cholestyramine should result in a decrease of 35.6 in plasma cholesterol from the levels of the cholestyramine treatment alone to an average of 54.9 mg. dl. It is found instead that the average decrease with the combination is 58 range 43 69 resulting in anaverage plasma cholesterol of 35.8 mg. dl. Thus treating dogs with a combination of choleStyramine and compound II after they have been treated with either agent by itself results in a synergistic response to the combination.

In a similar experiment, the effect of MSD 803 plus cholestyramine on dogs already treated with cholestyramine was found to be a reduction of plasma cholesterol by about 40 . Two beagle dogs were treated with 12 g day of cholestyramine until the plasma cholesterol levels had decreased to the expected levels of 35 below pretreatment values, where continued treatment resulted in no further decrease. Administration of MSD 803 at a level of 4 mg kg daily in combination with 12 g day of cholestyramine resulted in an additional lowering of plasma cholesterol of 39.7 from the cholestyramine baseline. Thus in one dog the cholesterol level after treatment with cholestyramine was 87.8 mg dl plasma.By 11 days of treatment with a combination of 12 g day cholestyramine and 4 mg kg day of MSD 803 the plasma cholesterol levels had decreased to a new plateau which remained constant from day 11 to 32 at a level of 54, or 38.58 below the initial cholestyramine base. In a similar manner the plasma cholesterol level of a second dog treated with cholestyramine was 94 mg dl. This decreased to 55.6 mg dl or 40.9 below the initial cholestyramine base after treatment with the combination of cholestyramine and 4 mg kg MSD 803.
