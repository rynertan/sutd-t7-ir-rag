# Electrical wire and cable.

## Abstract
Electrical wire and cable is provided with a layer of insula tion or jacketing material which comprises a mixture of 1 a polyester based on tetramethylene terephthalate, prefer ably polytetramethylene terephthalate and 2 more than 40 , based on polymer 1 , of a block copo lymer preferably having polytetramethylene terephthalate hard blocks and poly polytetramethylene oxide terephtha late soft blocks. Polymer 2 is a flex modulus of at least 69 MPa preferably at least 138 MPa. The insulation or jacketing material exhibits improved resistance to stress crazing in a number of solvents.
