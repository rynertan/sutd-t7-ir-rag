# Thermal transfer dyesheet.

## Abstract
A thermal transfer dyesheet having a printing surface against which a receptor substrate may be held to receive a thermally transferable dye in response to thermal stimuli applied to the dyesheet, the dyesheet comprising a substrate supporting a dyecoat comprising the thermally transferable dye dispersed throughout a polymeric binder, characterised in that the polymeric binder comprises a thermoset silicone composition as a continuous layer overlying the dyecoat, a process for its preparation, and the use of a thermoset silicone composition as a layer overlying the dyecoat.
