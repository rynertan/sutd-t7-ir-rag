## Description
DEVICE FOR DISPENSING FLUID, PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN THE FIELD OF HAIRDRESSING This invention relates to a hollow bristle brush, of a type useful in the field of hairdressing for coloring or discoloring hair or for lotion application. To carry out the former operation, it is current practice to prepare mixtures of sufficiently flowable consistency which are then dispensed and applied to the hair either by means of the hands only or with the aid of a conventional brush, the mixture being removed at the end of a sufficient time period for the hair to become impregnated with the mixture which may be, for example, a hair coloring fluid. Where for the same purpose use is made of a conventional vial containing a dye, the liquid contained therein must then be dispensed and applied to the hair by an operator who must compulsorily wear protective gloves. The above operations, however, are not devoid of drawbacks due to both the complexity of the individual steps required to achieve a uniform and capillary coloration of hair, and due to the time required to carry them out, and finally to the precautions to be observed by he she who carries them out by unavoidable contact with the mixture or dye. Also when a lotion is to be applied, since this is to affect the scalp, it is necessary that he she who applies it effects a massage or friction on the hair to favor penetration and a uniform dosage. Also in this case, drawbacks of the type cited above are apparent. It is the primary aim of this invention to obviate such prior drawbacks by providing a device for dispensing fluid which allows a fluid to be spread over the scalp and the hair without the operator coming in contact with it. A further important object is to provide a device for dispensing fluid which combines the above feature with that of simultaneously allowing uniform dispensing and application both to the scalp and the hair. Another important object is to provide a device for dispensing fluid which requires no skilled personnel in its use, and is very simple to use, while being of low cost and obtainable by utilization of ordinary plant and readily available materials. These and other objects are achieved by a device for dispensing fluid, characterized in that it comprises at least one box like structure, wherefrom protrude a plurality of bristles, said box like structure defining on its interior at least one vessel, at least some of said bristles having formed therein open ended hollow portions, said vessel being adapted for containing fluid and communicating with said hollow portions. Further features and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description of preferred but not exclusive embodiments, shown by way of illustration and not of limitation, in the accompanying drawings where Figure 1 is a three quarter perspective view of the device for dispensing fluid according to the invention Figure 2 is a transverse sectional view taken on the line II II of Figure 1 and Figure 3 shows a longitudinal sectional view of another embodiment of the device for dispensing fluid according to the invention. With reference to the above cited figures, the device for dispensing fluid, generally indicated by the reference numeral 1 expediently comprises a handle 2 which may be rigid and secured at one end to a boxlike structure 3 of substantially parallelepipedal shape. That structure 3 has an internal vessel defining cavity 4, and at the upper 5 and lower 6 surfaces, respectively, a cover 7 and a plurality of hollow bristles 8. The cover 7 has an essentially rectangular shape and is removably insertable between the end walls 13, 13a and the side walls 9, 10 of the structure 3 and closeable tightly thereon, the peripheral edges 11 of the cover 7 being correspondingly shaped to match a seat 12 formed at the top of the same. Obviously, other vessel and seal or cover arrangements are possible such as a slideably mounted cover or a cylindrical vessel defining structure and a circular cover engageable therewith through screw thread means. Advantageously, in the end or rear wall 13 of the structure 3, at the top edge thereof, there is formed a cutout 14 wherein a suitable implement or means for removing the cover 7 may be inserted. The bristles 8, of preferably conical shape, have an open ended hollow portion or longitudinal cavity 15 extending along their full length and communicating with the upper vessel or cavity 4. At the lateral surface of the bristles 8, there are expediently formed several holes or open ended hollow portions 16 and 17, advantageously located at different levels with respect to the longitudinal extension of the bristle 8 and being in communication with the cavity 15, which defines at the extremity thereof, a further open end or hole 18, such that a fluid 19 contained within the cavity 4 may pass through the cavity 15 and flow out of the bristles 8 through the holes, 16,17,18. The device 1 is used as folows initially, the cover 7 is to be removed, for example by acting with a sharp point on the cutout 14, filling the cavity 4 with a fluid 19 which may be, for example, a shampoo, dye, lotion, balsam, or decolorant, and subsequently replacing the cover in its seat to seal the cavity 4. It will now be sufficient for the operator to hold the handle 2 of the device 1 and brush the hair with the bristles 8 the fluid 19, in fact, will be dispensed by flowing out of the holes 16,17 and 18 and spread evenly both over the scalp and the base of the hair over the entire length thereof. Obviously, the number of bristles 8, as well as the number and positions of the holes 16 and 17 and the respective diameters may vary according to the type of fluid being used. Once a desired quantity of fluid has been dispensed, it will be sufficient to lay don the brush 1 by resting it on a surface with its cover 7 facing downwards, the tightness of seal between the edges of the cover 7 and the seat 12 preventing any leakage, thus expediently allowing the possibility of multiple applications without having to refill the vessel 4. Thus, it has been shown that the device for dispensing fluid achieves all of the objects set forth, enabling the operator to dispense and spread fluid uniformly in a single phase, both over the scalp and the hair, without contacting it, this operation also being very rapid and simple to perform. The invention herein is susceptible to many modifications and changes which fall within the scope of the same inventive concept thus, as an example,Figure 3 shows a variation of a device for dispensing fluid 101 having two box like structures 103a and 103b, the latter of which is formed within the handle 102. As for the former box like structure 103a has an internal cavity 104 communicating with a longitudinal cavity 115 of a plurality of bristles 108 protruding therefrom, such bristles having in their lateral surfaces and at the extremities thereof, holes 116,117 and 118, in communication with the cavity 115. The cavity 104 has a single opening composed of a hollow, externally threaded cylindrical block 120 onto which the matingly threaded lug 121 of the handle 102 is to be threadedly engaged. That lug 121 may comprise an internal partition 121a which can be displaced on threading in the block 120, the internal partition could comprise, for example a rupturable seal this enables all the fluid 119 to be disposed inside the cavity 122 of the handle structure 103b, the cavity 104 being left initially empty, and allows, therefore, either to provide a single dose for use at a desired time, or to use different fluids by associating with the structure 103a itself different handles 102. The latter and or the box like structure may be formed from a compliant or elastically deformable material such that it can be compressed by hand pressure, so as to cause fluid to flow out of the device under pressure as well as by gravity. Other equivalent forms may comprise a cover, hinged at one end, to a wall of the box like structure, or additionally to using the hollow bristles, the brush may also have solid bristles, the same being either rigid or flexible, whilst the fluid could be contained in refillable trays insertable in the box like structure. A further equivalent form may comprise a device for dispensing liquid in the form of a brush having an internal cavity, in communication with the hollow bristles, not accessible from the outside, this restricting its use to exhaustion of the contained fluid. The shape of the bristles may be the most appropriate one for their intended use, as may be their possible inclination with respect to the structure with wich they are associated. Of course, the materials used and the dimensions, including those of the bristles and the holes formed therein, as well as their number, may be any ones according to individual requirements.
