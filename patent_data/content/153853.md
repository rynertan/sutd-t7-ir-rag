# Thermoplastic resin base film for magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic resin base film for a magnetic recording medium includes a thermoplastic resin film 1 and a discontinuous film 2 adhering closely to at least one surface of the thermoplastic resin film 1 . The discontinuous film 2 has a thickness of not larger than 0.05Âµm and is composed of a polymer blend containing fine particles 3 . The polymer blend comprises a water soluble polyester copolymer and a water soluble polymer having at least one hydroxyl group in the recurring unit thereof. Fine protrusions are formed on the discontinuous film due to the presence of the fine particles therein. A magnetic recording medium using the base film is suitable for high density magnetic recording and has ex tremely excellent durability to repeated use.
