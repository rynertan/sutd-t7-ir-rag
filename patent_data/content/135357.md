# REACTOR

## Abstract
A multi tubular fired reactor for endothermic catalytic reactions is described including a furnace whose firebox is divided into a series of zones, each of which has its own individually controllable burner system. At any given mo ment a majority of the tubes can be on line whilst a minority are in the course of reactivation. By sequentially switching the zones from on line status to reactivation and vice versa, a substantially constant product composition can be maintained in a common outlet product collection system to which all the tubes are connected.
