# Selectively plugged sinterable honeycomb structures.

## Abstract
A sintered, honeycomb structure having plugged cell ends is formed in a single sintering step by plug ging the cell ends of a sinterable honeycomb structure with an appropriate material which, when heated to the sintering temperature of the structure and compared with any dimensional changes the structured undergoes during its sintering, provides a relative expansion of the plugs with respect to the structure of between about 1.5 and 7 and, preferably, between about 2 and 4 . Various exemplary batch mixtures are identified for fabricating solid particulate filter bodies from extruded ceramic substrates in which both the substrate and plugs sinter to primarily cordierite crystal phases at temperatures between about 1340 C and 1450 C.
