## Description
The present invention relates to dewaxing and hydrodewaxing catalysts comprising non zeolitic molecular sieves, as hereinafter described and to processes employing such catalysts. Dewaxing and hydrodewaxing processes are employed in the refining industry to treat petroleum fractions having initial boiling points over about 176.7 C to improve their pour point. The improvement in pour point is generally effected by selective removal of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Since the pour point of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, e.g., diesel fuels and other light gas oil fractions, are strictly controlled, the pour points specification of such fuels must be met if such are to be employed in their intended use. The need to reduce the pour point of petroleum fractions has resulted in the development of numerous dewaxing and hydrodewaxing processes wherein the pour points of petroleum fractions are reduced by selective removal of paraffinic hydrocarbons. Processes relating to dewaxing and hydrodewaxing are well known in both the patent and scientific literature. Such processes have employed crystalline aluminosilicates as catalysts. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 3,140,249, 3,140,252, 3,140,251, 3,140,253, 3,956,102 and 4,440,991. These and other patents disclose the use of various crystalline aluminosilicates as catalysts for dewaxing processes. Although a large number of zeolite materials have been disclosed as employable as catalysts for dewaxing and hydrodewaxing catalysts, the use of crystalline non zeolitic molecular sieves has not received significant attention. This lack of attention is attributable to the scarcity of molecular sieves other than crystalline aluminosilcates. One disclosure of a catalyst containing a crystalline silicate, as opposed to a crystalline aluminosilicate, is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,441,991. The instant invention provides for catalytic dewaxing and hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbon feedstocks by contacting such with catalysts comprising non zeolitic molecular sieves, as hereinafter described. The present invention relates to catalytic dewaxing and hydrodewaxing hereinafter jointly referred to as dewaxing processes and the catalysts employed in such processes. The catalysts comprise 1 at least one non zeolitic molecular sieve, as hereinafter described and 2 optionally, and in the instance of hydrodewaxing at least one hydrogenation component and 3 optionally, particles of a traditional dewaxing catalyst having catalytic activity for dewaxing and or hydrodewaxing hydrocarbon feedstocks at effective dewaxing conditions, e.g., particles of a traditional dewaxing catalyst containing a zeolitic aluminosilicate s of the type generally employed in such dewaxing catalysts. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in the instant invention, i.e., catalysts and processes, are characterized in their calcined form by an adsorption of isobutane of at least 2 percent by weight at a partial pressure of 0.67 bar and a temperature of 20 C. The traditional dewaxing catalyst component, e.g., a zeolitic aluminosilicate, if any, is characterized as being a dewaxing catalyst component, such as heretofore traditionally employed in hydroprocessing processes, e.g., the various forms of zeolite Y, silica alumina, and hydrogenation components. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in this invention are unique in that such are not zeolitic aluminosilicates, as heretofore employed in the prior art, but are specific non zeolitic molecular sieves, as hereinafter described. Dewaxing and hydrodewaxing processes involve converting high boiling and high pour point paraffinic waxes and hydrocarbons into lower boiling lower pour point products. Further, hydrodewaxing involves hydrogenating unsaturates in the product. The term dewaxing is employed herein to generally mean the removal of hydrocarbons which readily solidify from petroleum stocks as waxes and includes catalytic dewaxing and hydrodewaxing. The catalysts of the instant invention have been observed to convert normal paraffins in the hydrocarbon products and, accordingly, reduce the pour point of such products, i.e., act as dewaxing catalysts. This reduction in the pour point by selective normal paraffin conversion is of commercial significance since distillate products have rigid specifications on the acceptable pour point. The non zeolitic molecular sieves employed in the instant invention are selected from the hereinafter described group of non zeolitic molecular sieves consisting of CoAPSOs, FeAPSOs, MgAPSOs, MnAPSOs, TiAPSOs, ZnAPSOs, CoMnAPSOs, CoMgAPSOs, CoMnMgAPSOs, MeAPOs, TiAPOs, FeAPOs, ELAPOs and mixtures thereof having an adsorption of isobutane in its calcined form of at least 2 percent by weight at a partial pressure of 0.67 bar and a temperature of 20 C.

In one embodiment the LZ 210 containing hydrocracking catalysts disclosed in copending EP A 124 120, filed April 28, 1984, incorporated herein by reference, may be employed as an optional component of the catalyst.

ZSM 48 is more particularly described in U.S. Patent No. 4,423,021. The description of that zeolite, and particularly the specified X ray diffraction pattern thereof, is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, crystalline silicates such as silicalite U.S.Patent No. 4,061,724 may be employed with the NZ MSs of the instant invention. The catalysts of the instant invention comprise at least one NZ MS, as above characterized, and optionally, may also contain a hydrogenation catalyst and or one or more traditional dewaxing catalysts and or hydrocracking catalysts, including zeolitic aluminosilicate components. The relative amount of the NZ MS component or traditional hydroprocessing component, if any, will depend at least in part, on the selected hydrocarbon feedstock and on the desired pour point of the product, but in all instances an effective amount of at least one NZ MS is employed. When a zeolitic aluminosilicate is employed as a part of the traditional dewaxing component the relative weight ratio of the zeolitic aluminosilicate to the NZ MS is generally between 1 10 and 500 1, desirably between 1 10 and 200 1, preferably between 1 2 and 50 1, and most preferably is between 1 1 and 20 1. The zeolitic aluminosilicate and NZ MS may be ion exchanged with a selected cation s and or thermally treated either before or after mixture with each other or after such have been added separately or concurrently to one or more inorganic oxide matrix components. When the NZ MS molecular sieves are ion exchanged such are preferably exchanged with a hydrogen forming cation species, e.g. NH 4, H , quaternary ammonium cations, etc. The NZ MS preferably has at least part of its cations as hydrogen forming cation species. Hydrodewaxing catalysts may optionally contain a hydrogenation component of the type commonly employed in dewaxing catalysts. The hydrogenation component may be selected from the group of hydrogenation catalysts consisting of one or more metals of Group VI B and Group VIII, including the salts, complexes and solutions containing such metals. The preferred hydrogenation catalyst is at least one of the group of metals, salts and complexes selected from the group consisting of at least one of platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium and mixtures thereof or at least one from the group consisting of nickel, molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, titanium, chromium and mixtures thereof. As recognized in the art, the noble and base metals will not generally be employed in the same catalyst system. Reference to the catalytically active metal or metals is intended to encompass such metal or metals in the elemental state or in some form such as an oxide, sulfide, halide, carboxylate and the like. The hydrogenation component is present in an effective amount to provide an effective hydrodewaxing catalyst. When the hydrogenation catalysts is a noble metal it is generally present in an amount between 0.05 and 1.5 by weight based on the total weight of the dewaxing catalyst including the weight of any binder or matrix material which may be present, as hereinafter discussed, although effective amounts outside this range may be employed. Although effective amounts in excess of 1.5 percent by weight may be employed, the preferred effective amount of the noble metal hydrogenation component is between 0.3 and 1.2 by weight. When the hydrogenation catalyst is a base metal s the effective amount will generally be between 1.0 and 30 percent by weight or more of the base metal, expressed as the oxide s , based on the total weight of the dewaxing catalyst, although effective amounts outside this range may be employed. The final form of the hydrogenation component is not narrowly limited herein but may be a metal oxide, metal sulfide or other catalytically active form. Since sulfur is typically present in the hydrocarbon feedstock being treated, the actual form of some of the hydrogenation component s may well be at least in part a sulfide due to The hydrogenation components can be incorporated into the overall catalyst composition by any one of numerous procedures. In general it has been observed that it is desirable to add the hydrogenation component to the catalyst as a separate component rather than provide such by ion exchange or impregnation of the NZ MS component. They can be added either to the NZ MS component, zeolitic aluminosilicate component, if any, or to any metal oxide or to a combination thereof by ion exchange, impregnation and the like. In the alternative, multiple hydrogenation components two or more may be added as powders in the formulation of the catalyst. They may be added by co mulling, impregnation, or ion exchange whereby one or more may be added to NZ MS and or zeolitic aluminosilicate by impregnation, co mulling or co precipitation. For example, noble or base metal compounds, such as the sulfides, oxides or water soluble salts, can be added by co mulling, impregnation or precipitation before the composite is finally calcined. In the alternative these components can be added to the finished particle by impregnation with an aqueous, alcoholic, hydrocarbon or other nonaqeous solution of soluble compounds or precursors. Although the hydrogenation components can be combined with the NZ MS end or zeolitic aluminosilicate, if any, as the oxides such is generally not the case. They are usually added as a metal salt which can be thermally converted to the corresponding oxide in an oxidizing atmosphere or reduced to the metal with hydrogen or other reducing agent. The composition can be sulfided by reaction with a sulfur donor such as carbon disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, hydrocarbon thiols, elemental sulfur, and the like, described above. The above oxidizing or sulfiding processes are generally carried out on catalyst compositions which have been partially dried as desired , tableted, pelleted, extruded with binder or matrix , or formed by other means and then calcined, e.g., at a temperature above 315.5 C, usually above 426.7 C. It is well known in the art that dewaxing catalysts, are generally employed with a binder material or, as commonly referred to, with an inorganic oxide matrix which can be inert or also catalytically active. For example inorganic matrices such as silica, alumina, silica alumina, silica zirconia, silica magnesia, alumina boria, alumina titania and the like and mixtures thereof may be employed. An inorganic oxide need not always be employed such as in the case of a preform containing the NZ MS or may be employed in an amount between 1 and 95 by weight, preferably between 10 and 80 by weight, based on the total weight of the dewaxing catalyst. The term crude oil feedstock is used herein to denominate any crude oil feedstock or portion thereof and includes full range crude oils from primary, secondary or tertiary recovery from conventional or offshore oil fields and to the myriad of feedstocks derived therefrom. Crude oil feedstocks may also be syncrudes such as those that can be derived from coal, Fischer Tropsch fuel products shale oil, tar sands and bitumens. The crude oil feedstock may be virgin straight run or generated synthetically by blending. Such crude oil feedstocks are traditionally desalted prior to use since sodium chloride is known to be a poison in many hydroprocessing operations. Further, the term crude oil feedstocks is intended to include component parts of crude oils which have heretofore been generally employed as feedstocks or potential feeds and includes feeds such as distillate gas oils, heavy vacuum gas oils, VGO, atmospheric and vacuum resids, syncrudes, pulverized coal and fractions boiling above the traditional end of the gasoline boiling range which generally includes compounds containing greater than about eleven carbon atoms and combinations thereof. The hydrocarbon feedstock for dewaxing typically boils above 176.7 C, preferably between 204.4 C and 648.8 C and more preferably between 204.4 C and 482.2 C. The hydrocarbon feedstock may be pre treated in a hydrotreater to reduce, i.e. remove, compounds which contain sulfur and or nitrogen. The hydrocarbon feedstock may have a significant sulfur content, present as hydrogen sulfide, ranging from 0.1 to 3 weight percent, and nitrogen content, present as ammonia, in an amount up to 20,000 ppm. Temperature, space velocity, and other process variables may be adjusted to compensate for the effects of nitrogen on the dewaxing catalyst activity. The feedstock is contacted in the dewaxing reaction zone with the dewaxing catalyst and, optionally, in the presence of hydrogen containing gas. In hydrodewaxing, hydrogen is consumed in the hydrodewaxing process and an excess of hydrogen is typically maintained in the reaction zone. Advantageously, a hydrogen to oil feed ratio of at least 28.32 m³ hydrogen per 159 liters of feed 1,000 standard cubic feet of hydrogen per barrel of feed SCFB is employed, and the hydrogen to oil ratio may range up to 56.6 m³ 20,000 SCFB . Preferably, 113 to 340 m³ 4,000 to 12,000 SCFB is employed. Typically dewaxing and hydrodewaxing conditions are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. Re 28,398, U.S. Patent No. 3,852,189 and U.S. Patent No. 4,282,085. The instant process is carried out under effective catalystic dewaxing or hydrodewaxing conditions. Catalytic dewaxing is generally carried out at a LHSV liquid hourly space velocity between 0.2 and 50, a temperature between 260 C and 648.8 C, a pressure between subatmospheric and 506.5 bar. Hydrodewaxing is generally carried out at a LHSV between 0.1 and 15, a temperature between 204.4 C and 482.2 C, at a pressure between 1.702 bar and 173.3 bar and using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon feedstock between 1 and 100.
