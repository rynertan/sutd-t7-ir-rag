# Stable nitrate slurry explosives.

## Abstract
Explosives that are sensitized blends of inorganic nitrate, eg., AN, particles, such as AN or ANFO prills, and an aqueous slurry comprising a thickened aqueous solution of an inorganic oxidizing salt, preferably AN, are rendered storage stable by keeping the slurry s water content low enough, and its viscosity high enough, that the slurry is water retentive. Water immobilization in the slurry, a re quirement for storage stability, is achieved despite the slurry s flowable consistency at the time of blending. A blend containing about 25 slurry or less, is essentially in the form of a granular mass of free flowing, high density, slurry bearing prills, and the slurry is sensitizable by the prills alone. As the slurry content exceeds about 25 , the blend takes on the characteristics of a thick slurry, requiring a supplemental sensitizer in the slurry per se. Slurries contain ing a nitrogen base salt of an inorganic oxidizing acid, preferably monomethylamine nitrate, are preferred because this additive affords a saturated solution with lower water content, and also can act as a sensitizer.
