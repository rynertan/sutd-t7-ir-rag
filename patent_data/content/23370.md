## Description
PROCESS FOR THE RECOVERY OF ISOPRENE, AND ISOPRENE SO RECOVERED The present invention is concerned with a process for recovering isoprene from a C5 hydrocarbon fraction and with the isoprene so recovered. Isoprene is a well known product and is used for many purposes, such as the manufacture of homo or copolymers of isoprene. Isoprene may be prepared by various techniques, such as by the pyrolysis of mineral oil fractions. In cracking mineral oil fractions, such as naphtha, gas oil and paraffin wax for the preparation of ethylene, considerable quantities of olefinically unsaturated compounds having more than 2 carbon atoms are formed. Considerable quantities of isoprene occur in the hydrocarbon fraction having predominantly five carbon atoms. This C5 hydrocarbon fraction may be separated from the other fractions by techniques, such as distillation. The C5 hydrocarbon fraction is a complex mixture of pentanes, i.e. isopentane and normal pentane, pentenes, penta dienes, including isoprene and possibly cyclopentadiene and pentynes. Various processes are known for recovering isoprene from this fraction. Such processes usually comprise a combination of one or more fractional distillation steps and one or more solvent extraction steps, such as liquid liquid extraction and or extractive distillation steps. Sclvent extraction is necessary because the C5 hydrocarbon fraction contains components, e.g. normal pentane, which are very difficult to separate from isoprene using only fractional distillation techniques.Such processes may also include a thermal dimerization step to convert any cyclopentadiene to dicylopentadiene which may be removed as the residue of a fractional distillation process. Various extraction solvents are known from the literature.One class of solvent, particularly suitable for use in liquidliquid extraction techniques, are the sulfolanes which are disclosed in U.S. 2,360,859 as being useful for separation of mixtures of similar organic compounds having different degrees of saturation, e.g. pentanes, pentenes and isoprene. The Applicants have now found a novel process for the recovery of isoprene in which use is made of a sulfolane in a liquid liquid extraction step. According to the present invention a process for recovering isoprene from a C5 hydrocarbon fraction comprising a mixture of pentanes, i.e. isopentane and normal pentane, pentenes, pentadienes, including isoprene, and pentynes and which possibly also comprises small amounts of various hydrocarbons having carbon numbers below C5 and or above C5 comprises subjecting the hydrocarbon fraction to the following stages which may be carried out in any order with the exception that the heavy hydrocarbon removal stage should not precede the liquid liquid extraction stage i a light hydrocarbon removal stage to remove, by means of fractional distillation, those hydrocarbons, present in the hydrocarbon fraction, which boil at a temperature below the boiling point of isoprene ii a liquid liquid extraction stage using in a first step a sulfolane as the extract ant to form a first raffinate phase rich in normal pentane and pentenes and a sulfolane extract phase rich in isoprene, subjecting the sulfolane extract phase to a second liquid liquid extraction step using a counter solvent, which is a C6 or higher alkane, as the extractant to form a second raffinate phase com prising mainly the sulfolane and a counter solvent extract phase rich in isoprene and fractionally distilling the counter solvent extract phase to remove the counter solvent therefrom iii a heavy hydrocarbon removal stage to remove, by means of fractional distillation, those hydrocarbons, present in the hydrocarbon fraction, which boil at a temperature above the boiling point of isoprene. The above novel process results in an isoprene recovery process which is economically attractive especially in so far as the utilization of heat is concerned for example, it is not necessary to apply to, or withdraw from, the isoprenecontaining fractions substantial amounts of heat between the stages. A further advantage of the process is that any dicyclopentadiene which is present in the feedstock is substantially completely removed via the first raffinate phase.The present invention is particularly suitable for preparing isoprene concentrates comprising from 75 to 99.9 w of isoprene. As stated above the stages of the isoprene recovery process may be carried out in any order with the exception that the heavy hydrocarbon removal stage should not precede the liquidliquid extraction stage. Thus, the sequence of stages may be a the light hydrocarbon removal stage followed by the twostep liquid liquid extraction stage followed by the heavy hydrocarbon removal stage or b the liquid liquid extraction stage followed by the light hydrocarbon removal stage followed by the heavy hydrocarbon removal stage or c the liquid liquid extraction stage followed by the heavy hydrocarbon removal stage followed by the light hydrocarbon removal stage. However, the above sequence a is preferred. According to this preferred aspect of the present invention a process for recovering isoprene from a C5 hydrocarbon fraction, comprising a mixture of pentanes, i.e. isopentane and normal pentane, pentenes,pentadienes, including isoprene, and pentynes and which possibly also comprises small amounts of various hydrocarbons having carbon numbers below C5 and or aboveC5, comprises i fractional distillation of the hydrocarbon fraction to obtain a first distillate fraction, comprising mainly hydrocarbons which boil at a temperature below the boiling point of isoprene, and a first residual fraction comprising the remainder of the hydrocarbon fraction ii extraction of isoprene and hydrocarbons which boil above the boiling point of isoprene from the first residual fraction by a series of steps comprising a subjecting the first residual fraction to liquid liquid extraction by contacting the residual fraction with a sulfolane to obtain a first raffinate phase rich in normal pentane and pentenes and a firstextract phase comprising the sulfolane and the remainder of the residue b subjecting the first extract phase to liquid liquid extraction with the counter solvent comprising a C6 or higher alkane to obtain a second raffinate phase comprising mainly the sulfolane and a second extract phase comprising mainly the counter solvent, isoprene and other hydrocarbons which boil at a temperature above the boiling point of isoprene, and c fractionaRydistilling the second extract phase to obtain a second residual fraction comprising mainly the counter solvent and a second distillate fraction comprising mainly isoprene and hydro carbons which boil at a temperature above the boiling point of isoprene, and iii fractional distillation of the second distillate to obtain a third residual fraction comprising mainly hydrocarbons which boil at a temperature above the boiling point of isoprene and a third distillate fraction comprising mainly isoprene. As stated above the C5 hydrocarbon fraction may contain cyclopentadiene which may be converted to dicyclopentadiene by thermal dimerization heat soaking . The dimerization of cyclopentadiene may take place at various stages of the recovery process, e.g. before or after the solvent extraction stage or before or after the various distillation stages however, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the cyclopentadiene is dimerized before the C5 hydrocarbon fraction is subjected to any one of the above stages. The dicyclopentadiene thus formed may be removed by any conventional technique such as the residue of a fractional distillation process however, an advantage of the present invention is that substantially all of the dicyclopentadiene is removed via the first raffinate phase. It may be desirable to operate the liquid liquid extraction step with a sulfolane in such a way that not all of the normal pentane is removed in the raffinate phase in which case any remaining normal pentane in the sulfolane extract phase may be removed therefrom by stripping before the liquid liquid extraction step with the counter solvent.It may also be desirable to subject the isoprene fraction to a purification treatment, e.g. to remove any residual acetylenes therefrom such purification treatments include sodium or selective hydrogenation treatments. The sulfolane for use in the present invention is preferably sulfolane itself which has the formula EMI5.1 although derivatives may also be used, such as those compounds wherein one or more of the hydrogen atoms is replaced by an organic radical which may contain a polar grouping and more specifically may contain oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and or halide atoms. In hydrocarbon substituted sulfolanes the hydrocarbon radicals are preferably alkyl radicals. A suitable hydrocarbon substituted sulfolane is methyl sulfolane.Sulfolane derivatives containing oxygen include hydroxy sulfolanes, sulpholanyl ethers and esters sulfolane derivatives containing nitrogen include sulpholanyl amines, nitriles and nitro sulfolanes sulfolane derivatives containing sulphur include sulpholanyl sulphides, sulphoxides and sulphones. Other sulfolane derivatives may contain halide radicals, inorganic esters or mixed radicals of those above mentioned, such as acid amides, halohydrins, sulphonamides, etc. Derivatives may be made by condensing a conjugated diolefin with sulphur dioxide, and then subjecting the resultant product te hydrogenation, alkylation, hydration, amination, chlorination, nitration and or other substitution or addition reactions. The counter solvent for use in the present invention is a C6 or higher alkane. Such alkanes, which may be linear, branched or cyclic, are preferably C6 to C8 alkanes. The invention is illustrated by reference to the accompanying drawing which is a schematic flow plan. It will be understood that various pieces of equipment which are not essential for an understanding of the present invention, e.g. storage vessels, accumulators, pumps and heaters are not shown in the drawing. A feedstock 1 comprising the C5 hydrocarbon fraction is fed to a fractional distillation column D1. Suitably the column is operated at superatmospheric pressure, e.g. from 1.1 to 10.0 bars absolute and elevated temperatures, e.g. from 50 to 150 C.A first distillate fraction, comprising mainly hydrocarbons which boil at a temperature below the boiling point of isoprene is withdrawn as stream 2 from the top of the column and a first residual fraction comprising the remainder of the hydrocarbon fraction is withdrawn as stream 3 from the bottom of the columnD1 and fed to the extraction zone E1. Suitably, the stream 3 is fed to the lower section of the zone. A stream 5 of sulfolane is fed to the top of this zone and flows in countercurrent to the first residual fraction.The extraction zone is suitably operated at superatmospheric pressure, e.g. from 1.1 to 10 bars absolute and from 50 to 1500C.An important advantage of the present invention is that the first residual fraction may be fed to the extraction zone at substantially the same temperature as it leaves the distillation zone D1, i.e. it is possible to achieve efficient extraction in the extraction zone E1 without first lowering its temperature.A first raffinate phase, comprising mainly normal pentane and pentenes, is withdrawn as stream h from the top of the zone.This first raffinate phase in general is composed of those C5 hydrocarbons, e.g. normal pentane which are difficult to separate easily from isoprene by fractional distillation techniques and also any dicyclopentadiene present in the feedstock. A first extract phase, comprising sulfolane and the remainder of the first residual fraction, is withdrawn as stream 6 from the bottom of the zone and may be fed to a stripping zone S or directly to the second extraction zone E2 depending on whether or not the extract phase comprises a significant amount of normalpentane. If it does contain a significant amount of normalpentane then the extract phase is fed to the stripping zone S if it does not, then it is fed directly to the second extraction zone E2. The stripping zone S suitably comprises a stripping column operating at a lower pressure than the extraction zone and suitably at a temperature of from 50 to 1500C. From the top of the stripper is withdrawn a stream 7 which is rich in normalpentane. In order to ensure substantially complete removal of normal pentane from the extract phase it may be necessary to remove simultaneously some pentenes and pentadienes therefrom in which case it is advantageous to recycle stream 7 to the lower section of extraction zone E1. The bottom stream 8 from the stripper S, comprising the remainder of the first extract phase, is fed to the second extraction zone H2. Suitably, the extract phase is fed to the upper section of the extraction zone E2 The C6 or higher alkane, which acts as the counter solvent, is fed as stream 10 to the lower section of the zone and flows in counter current to the first extract phase and re extracts therefrom substantially all of the C5 hydrocarbons present therein. The second extraction zone E2 is suitably operated at superatmospheric pressure, e.g. from 1.1 to 10 bars absolute and from 50 to 1500C. A second raffinate phase is withdrawn from the lower section of the zone. This phase comprises mainly sulfolane which is advantageously recycled, together with make up sulfolane, if necessary, added as stream 14, to the first extraction zone E1 as stream 5.A second extract phase is formed, comprising mainly the counter solvent, isoprene and C5 hydrocarbons which boil above the boiling point of isoprene, and is withdrawn as stream 9 from the top section of the zone and fed to the second fractional distillation column D2. The distillation column D2 is suitably operated at a bottom temperature of from 80 to 1200C and a pressure of from 1.2 to 3 bars absolute. Suitably the second extract phase, if necessary, is heated to a temperature of from 80 to 1200C before it is fed to the column. A second residual fraction is obtained which is withdrawn from the bottom of the column. This second residual fraction comprises mainly the counter solvent and is advantageously recycled, together with make up counter solvent, if necessary, added as stream 15, to the second extraction zone E2 as stream 10. A second distillate fraction, comprising mainly isoprene and C5 hydrocarbons which boil above the boiling point of isoprene, is withdrawn as stream 11 from the top of the distillation column D2 and fed to the third fractional distil lation column D3. The distillation column D3 is suitably operated at a teSper ature of fron 50 to 1500C and a pressure of fre 1.c te bars absolute. A third residual fraction is obtained, comprising mainly C5 hydrocarbons boiling above the boiling point of isoprene, which is withdrawn as stream 13 from the bottom of the column. A third distillate fraction is obtained comprising mainly isoprene which is withdrawn as stream 12 Prcmthe top of the column. The invention will now be iliustrated with reference to the following Examples.
