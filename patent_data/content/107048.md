## Description
UNITED STATES PATENT APPLICATION OF Richard Brian Allen, Harold Frazee Giles, Jr. Jean Marie Hubert Heuschen and Robert Alan Wiercinaki FOR ACRYLIC MODIFIED COMPOSITIONS OF POLYCARBONATE AND POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE BACXGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aromatic carbonate polymers are a well known and available family of materials which enjoy a variety of applications in the field of plastics. These polymers can be prepared by a number of procedures. In one way, the polymer is produced by reacting a dihydric phenol, e.g., 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, with a carbonate precursor, e.g., phosgene, in the presence of an acid binding agent. In general, aronatic polycarbonate resins can be molded or otherwise shaped into articles which possess highly desirable chemical and physical properties, including resistance to attack by mineral acids, resistance to staining, high impact strength in thin walled sections and good dimensional stability. Polycarbonates are known to be admixable with various polyesters, including poly alkylene terephthalates . Such blends are often more cost effective than the polycarbonate alone.Compositions of polycarbonate resins and polyester are disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Patent No. 3,864,428 Nakamura, et al. . Cohen et al.,U.S. 4,257,937, describe thermoplastic molding compositions of poly l,4 butylene tere phthalate , optionally also containing poly ethylene terephthalate , and a modifier composed of a combination of a polyacrylate resin and an aromatic polycarbonate.The compositions can also include fillers and or reinforcements and flame retardant additives. Fromuth er al., U.S. 4,264,487, disclose compositions based on aromatic polyesters such as polymeric resins of C2 to C3 alkylene tarephthalates, which contain synergistic amounts of acrylate based core shell polymer and aromatic polycarbonate. The compositions are described as having high impact strength and an increased heat deflection temperature. Still other modified polyester compositions are described elsewhere in the patent literature. Dieck et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,220,735 indicate that a polyblend composed of poly 114 butylene terephthalate resin and poly ethylene terephthalate resin can be modified for greater impact strength by including effective amounts of a selectively hydrogenated monoalkenyl arene diene block copolymer, for example, polystyrene polybutadienepolystyrene, together with an aromatic polycarbonate resin. Gergen et al. in U.S. Patent No, 4,111,895 disclose multi component polymer blends comprised of polycarbonate, a selectively hydrogenated monoalkenyl arene diene block copolymer and at least one dissimilar engineering thermoplastic, for example, thermoplastic polye√©rs. The components are admixed under conditions such that at least two of the polymers form continuous network phases which interlocks with other polymer networks to produce a desirable balance of properties. Sussink et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,267,096 teach that the use of a selectively hydrogenated elastomeric block copolymer together with an amorphous polyester improves the melt flow characteristics, resistance to brittle failure and resistance to enviromental stress cracking of polycarbonate resin. Japanese laid open patent application 044,373 describes thermoplastic molding compositions of polyester resin, e.g., poly ethylene terephthalate , polycarbonate resin and minor amounts of a third resin obtained by polymerizing a shell comprising aromatic hydrocarbon and, optionally, methacrylate or similar monomer onto a rubbery acrylic core. The composition of these ingredients is said to have excellent moldability, mechanical and thermal properties. A disadvantage associated with use of poly alkylene terephthalate is its relatively low notched impact strength, which this carries over into blends of the polyester with aromatic polycarbonates. It has been proposed that the notched impact strength of poly alkylene terephthalates can be improved upon by admixture with an impact modifier systems composed of an aromatic polycarbonate and acrylate based polymer. Compositions of this type are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,257,937 Cohen, et al. , U.S. 4,264,487 Fromuth, et al. , and the above mentioned Japanese patent publication. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION The discovery has rrow been made of new thermoplastic blends capable of being molded, extruded, calendered, or otherwise shaped. The blends are comprised of not substantially less than fifty one percent by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, poly ethylene terephthalate resin, which is the only polyester present in the composition, and an acrylate based c repolymerized acrylate shell polymer. Preferably, the present kind of compositlons will also include an effective amount of a flame retardant agent.as well as one or more additives for stabilizing the blends against deterioration dring melt processing and or upon exposure to ultraviolet light radiation after molding. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compositions of the invention will comprise in all cases an aromatic polycarbonate resin. The polycarbonate is preferably a high molecular weight polymer having the formulaEMI5.1 where Rl and R2 are hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl and n is at least 30, and preferably 40 to 400. The term lower alkyl includes hydrocarbon groups of from 1 6 carbon atoms. High molecular weight, thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates in the sense of the present invention are to be understood as homopolycarbonatei and copolycarbonates and mixtures thereof which have a number average molecular weight of about 8,000 to more than 200,000, preferably about 10,000 to 80,000 and an intrinsic viscosity of 0.30 to 1.0 deciliters per gram dl. g. as measured in solution in methylene chloride at 250c. The polycarbonates are derived from dihydric phenols such as, for example, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl propane, 2,2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane, and 3,3 dichloro 4,4 dihydroydiphenyl methane. Other dihydric phenols for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. The polycarbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene in accordance with methods set forth in the above cited literature and in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. The aromatic polycarbonates utilized in the present invention also include the polymeric derivatives of a dihydric phenol, a dicarboxylic acid, and carbonic acid, such as are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,169,121. It is also possible to employ two or more differ ent dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or acid terminated polyester, or with a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the aromatic polycarbonate. Also employable are blends of any of the above materials. Branched polycarbonates, such as are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,001,1841 can be utilized, as can blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. The most preferred polycarbonate for use with the present compositions is tinat prepared from bisphenol . and phosgene. .s explained, the compositions of the Invention will also contain a polyterhylene terephthalate resin as the only polyester in the compositions. Especially preferred is poly ethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.2, and more usually from 0.4 to 1.5 deciliters per gram measured in solution in 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane at 250 to 300C. Procedures for preparing the poly ethylene terephthalate are known to those skilled in the art.The descriptions in U.S. Patent No. 2,465,319 to Whinfield, et al. and U.S. Patent No, 3,047,539 to Pengilly are helpful. In addition, the compositions will contain a third polymeric ingredient which is an acrylate based core shell polymer. In general this polymer is multi phase, having a rubbery first stage and a thermoplastic hard final stage, and more specifically is composed of a crosslinked acrylicbased first stage which has been grafted to an outer, rigid thermoplastic stage, optionally including one or more intermediate phases, but never a vinyl aromatic conpound, e.g., polymerized styrene. Preferably, the core shell polymer is comprised of about 25 95 percent by weight of a first elastomeric phase polymerized from a monomer system of about 75 99.8 percent by weight of a C1 C6 alkyl acrylate, 0.1 5 percent by weight of crosslinking monomer, and 0.1 5 percent by weight of graft linking monomer, and about 75 to 5 percent by weight of a final, rigid thermoplastic phase consisting of polymerized acrylate. In greater detail, the first stage is polymerized from about 75 to 99.8 by weight of C1 C6 acrylate resulting in an acrylic rubber core having a glass transition temperature Tg below 100C. and is crosslinked with the crosslinking monomer and further contains graft linking monomer. The crosslinking monomer is polyethylenically unsaturated, such as butylene diacrylace, butylene dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene, rimetflylolpropane trimethacrylate, and the like. Such monomers have a plurality of double bonds which addition polymerize at substantially the same rate. The graft linking monomer is polyethylenically unsaturated and has a plurality of double bonds at least one of which polymerizes at a substantially different rate from at least one of the other reactive groups.Examples of graft linking monomer include allyl methacrylate and diallyl maleate. The outer, rigid thermoplastic phase of the core shell polymer is polymerized from a monomer system consisting of 100 weight percent of one or more C1 to C4 alkyl methacrylates. The core shell polymers employed in this invention are prepared by well known methods, for example, conventional emulsion polymerization techniques. These polymers are described further in U.S. Patent No. 4,096,202 to Farnham et al. . An essential feature of this invention is that the compositions always contain at least about fifty one percent by weight of aromatic polycarbonate, based on the combined weights of polycarbonate, poly ethylene terephtha later and acrylate based core shell polymer. In preferred embodiments, the aromatic polycarbonate is present in amounts ranging from about 1 to 97 percent by weiqht o the three ingredients combined, and correspondingly, the poly ethylene terephthalate is emtioyeo in the range frcm about 3 to about 9 percent by weight The core shell polymer need be present in only relatively small amounts, for example, from about 3 to about 20 percent by weight, to provide satisfactory notched impact strengths for the composition. The compositions of the invention can and preferably do contain a flame retardant amount of a flame retardant agent, for example, a brominated polystyrene, decabromobiphenyl ether, bis tetrabromophthalimide ethane, pentabromoethylbenzene, 1,2 bis 2,4,6 tribromophthalic anhydride, tetrabromobisphenol A di 2 hydroxyethyl other, and the like. In the most preferred cases, the flame retardant agent will be a haloqenated polycarbonate, and especially a halogenated bisphenol A homopolymer or copolymer.These polymers can be derived, for instance, from chlorinated or brominated bisphenol A, preferred examples beina tetrabromo bisphenol A polycarbonate and tetrachloro bisphenol A polyzarbonate, tetrabromo or tetrachloro bisphenol A copolycarbonate, statistical mixtures of halogenated bisphenol A polycarbonates, including chloro bromo bisphenolA polycarbonates, and so forth. Processes for preparing such polymers are well documented in the orior art. Generally, the flame retardant agent will be included in amounts of at least about 5 and more normally from about 10 to about 40 percent of the total weight of the composition. The compositions can also contain supplementary non resinous ingredients to improve other chemical and physical properties of the moldings. The additives are selected from amonq those normally employed in polycarbonate and or polyester moldina compositions, including melt and or ultraviolet light stabillzers, drip retardants, reinforcing fibers, mineral fillers, dyers, pigments, plasticizers, nob release agents, etc. Special mention is made of compositions according to this invention which also include from about 0.01 to about 0.5 wt. of an organic phosphite, e.g. trisnonylphenylphosphite. These are especially processable at high temperatures. The other, above mentioned supplementary ingrediants are added in minor but effective amounts typically ranging from 0.01 to 45 percent by weight based on the total composition. Preparation of the compositions may be accomplished by a number of procedures. Illustratively, the ingredients are tumbled in a dry mixer to form a pre blend, the pre blend is compounded on an extruder at a temperature from 475 to 6000F., and the extrudate is molded at a temperature of 450 to 600OF. Of course, other procedures well known to those skilled in this art can be used. The following examples illustrate the invention.These are not intended as a limitation on the scope of the invention. All parts are on a weight basis unless specified otherwise.
