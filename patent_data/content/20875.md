A platform 12 is connected to a frame 10 , inclined to the horizontal at an angle, and is operable in a first position thereof below an unloading station for accepting the containers, movable subsequently to a second position spaced substantially above the first position for unloading the containers to a discharge station, and movable thereafter to return to the first position. Drive means 40 are provided for moving the platform 12 and control means 27, 28, 42, 44, 46 are connected to the platform 12 for controlling the operation thereof, which include detecting means 42, 44, 46 for sensing when at least one container has been loaded thereinto, and for thereafter commanding the drive means 40 to move the platform 12 from the first position to the second position. The frame 10 is formed with a substantially vertically disposed wall guard means 24 restrain each container from tumbling against the wall and impacting thereon when the container is received by the platform 12 .
