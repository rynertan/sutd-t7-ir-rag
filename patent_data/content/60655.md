# Electrical connector assembly.

## Abstract
A two part electrical connector assembly 11, 12 has a channel shaped latching arm 26 mounted with its limbs 27 straddling one connector 11 and slidable in a slot 25 be tween walls 16, 33 of the connectors 11, 12 . Ends of the limbs 27 are formed with apertures 31 adapted to engage resilient detents 35 on the other connector 12 when the latching member 26 is retracted about the connector 11 to latch the connectors together. The limbs 27 having slots 28 engaging projections 23 on the one connector 11 to permit movement of the latching member 26 from the retracted latching condition to an extended position, remote from the detents 35 where it serves as a handle for manual disengage ment of the connectors 11, 12 .
