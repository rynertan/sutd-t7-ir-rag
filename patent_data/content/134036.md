# A CONTROL VALVE APPARATUS FOR FLUID ACTUATED SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A control valve apparatus, for fluid actuated systems comprises a housing having supply passage means for sup plying source fluid and action passage means for supplying a work performing fluid an adjustable valve assembly with in said housing at a location between said supply passage means and said action passage means, said valve assem bly comprising a pair of cooperating valve members indivi dually rotatable about a common axis, one said valve member being a driver member and the other a follower member means for effecting rotation of said driver member independently of said follower member to move the valve members out of a neutral position, in which no through pas sages are formed between said supply passage means and said action passage means, to a position in which fluid passage is formed through said valve assembly, and reac tive damming means fed by a metered portion of fluid pass ing through said valve assembly for effecting subsequent followup rotation by said follower member, thereby to re form said neutral position after termination of said driver member rotation.
