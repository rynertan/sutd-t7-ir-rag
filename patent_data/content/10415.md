# Method for producing a semiconductor film.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of producing a stabilized photoconducting semiconductor film by electroplating onto a cathode body. The film is of amorphous silicon containing hydrogen. A solution 16 of a halogenated silane, and or silicon halide, in an aprotic solvent containing a tetrabutylammonium salt is electroysed, in a nitrogen atmosphere, using a platinum anode 20 and nichrome cathode 26 . The plated cathode is removed to a nitrogen containing chamber 128 , and the chamber purged with helium or hydrogen. Cathode 26 is then removed to a heating chamber 30 and heated in the presence of helium or hydrogen at above 250 C, preferably 350 C for thirty minutes. The silicon film is thereby stabilized chemically and physically. Subsequently, a pellucid layer of high work function, for example of platinium, iridium or palladium, can be deposited on the thus stabilized film to produce a photovoltaic device.
