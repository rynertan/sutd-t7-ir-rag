# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO GAMING OR AMUSEMENT MACHINES

## Abstract
In a gaming machine, e.g. of the fruit machine type the symbols are inscribed on the peripheral cylindrical surface of drums or reels. A respective co axial disc 1 is mounted for rotation with each symbol bearing drum and the rotational position of the drum is sensed by sensing the rotational posi tion of the disc 1 . A ring 4 of alternate black and white surfaces is painted on the disc. A light source 6 and receiver 7 are mounted to one side of the disc and reflections from the white areas of the ring 4 are reproduced as pulses in the receiver. These are counted to provide an indication of the position of the disc.
