# Injection moulding method and apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 for assisting in the removal of an injection moulded article 24 from the core 22 of a mould is disclosed in combination with a moulding machine in which the mould core 22 is fixed to a moving platen 18 and an ejector mechanism 28 is supplied which mechanically removes the article 24 from the core 22 . The assisting apparatus includes a conduit 32 leading to a surface 34 of the mould core which defines the bottom 26 of the article formed. A piston 40 and cylinder 36 is connected to the conduit 32 , the interior of the cylinder 36 being dimen sioned to be approximately equal to the interior volume of the article 24 formed. The cylinder 36 is fixed with respect to the platen 15 while the piston 40 is fixed with respect to the ejector apparatus 28 . As the ejector 28 moves with respect to the mould core 22 so as mechanically to strip the moulded article 24 from the core 22 , the piston 40 moves within the cylinder 36 which is filled with air at approximately 1 atmosphere, thereby causing the air within the cylinder 36 to be introduced into the conduit 32 and thus into the void developing between the bottom 26 of the formed article 24 and the mould core 22 , thereby preventing deforma tion of the formed article 24 .
