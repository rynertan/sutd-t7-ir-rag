## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for removing fine cold shut cracks on a horizontally and continuously cast steel strand, using ejection of a plurality of metal shot, which comprises horizontally and intermittently withdrawing a cast steel strand from a horizontal mold 2 by a plurality of cycles each comprising a pull and a push, cooling the cast steel strand in a cooling zone 6 provided following the horizontal mold on the same horizontal level as that of the horizontal mold, increasing the temperature of the surface portion of the solidified shell of the cast steel strand in a heat restoring zone 26 provided following the cooling zone on the same horizontal level as that of the cooling zone, to soften the surface portion of the solidified shell of the cast steel strand, and then continuously ejecting a plurality of metal shot 15 from a plurality of shooters 14 in a shooting zone 13 provided following the heat restoring zone on the same horizontal level as that of the heat restoring zone onto the cast steel strand, to weld fine cold shut cracks produced on the surface portion of the solidified shell of the cast steel strand under the pressure applied by the plurality of metal shot thus ejected, thereby substantially completely removing the fine cold shut cracks.
