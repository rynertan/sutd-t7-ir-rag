# A PROCESS FOR PREPARING MALLEABLE COLLAGEN AND THE PRODUCT THEREOF

## Abstract
A collagen preparation having unique properties of elasticity and malleability which is associated with a micro scopic structure having an intertwining rope like characteris tics, and a process for preparing same are disclosed. The collagen thus formed is the second nucleation product obtained upon incubation of a supernatant from a quick harvested first stage nucleation product.
