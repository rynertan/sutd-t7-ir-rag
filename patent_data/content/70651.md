# Control system for a press having a synchronized feed mechanism.

## Abstract
A control system includes a first drive motor 10 for a press, a second drive motor 11 for a feed mechanism, means 20, 21, 22 responsive to the positions of the press and the feed mechanism for producing an output signal representing any change in the positional relationship between the press and the feed mechanism, control means 13, 14 responsive to the output signal for controlling the speed of the drive motor 11 for the feed mechanism, and means for adjusting the con trol means 13 to simulate a change in the press position and thereby effect a movement of the feed mechanism. An inter lock 30, 31 is responsive to adjustments of the control means 13, 14 for enabling the startup of the press only when the control means 13, 14 is in a preselected position represen ting a desired positional relationship between the press and the feed mechanism.
