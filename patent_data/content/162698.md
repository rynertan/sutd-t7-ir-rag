# Solderable conductive compositions, methods for their preparation, and substrates coated with them.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with solderable conductive compositions. These compositions comprise metal and or alloy thereof coated with one or more saturated monocar boxylic acid, the coated metal and or alloy thereof being dis persed in organic polymeric matrix. Also disclosed is a method for preparing such solderable conductive composi tions, and a method of coating metal and or alloy thereof with one or more saturated monocarboxylic acid.
