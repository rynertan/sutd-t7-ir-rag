# Window insulation system.

## Abstract
A thermal insulation system for a window comprising a roller blind 22 carried by a roller blind mechanism which is arranged to be fixed to a window frame 14 above a window 18 to be insulated. The blind 22 is adapted to be detachably connectable to the window frame 14 by means of touch fastener Velcro strips 24a, 24b, 26 carried by the longitudinal side edges and the free transverse edge of the blind 22 and mating touch fastener strips 28a, 28b, 30 carried by the frame. A mounting mechanism 48, 50 for the roller blind should enable this to be selectably displaceable between a first position, in which the roller blind mechanism is spaced from the frame 14 to enable the blind 22 to be retracted and extended against the tension of a rewind spring within the mechanism, and a second position in which the roller blind periphery engages a resilient strip 60 disposed across the window frame above the window to provide sealing at the upper end of the blind.
