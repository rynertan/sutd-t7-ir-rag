The arrangement is provided with a foundation which rests upon the ground of the cemetery, or other location. At least one further portion of the arrangement, which may be part of a pre existing monument, is provided with a repository chamber adapted for receiving a remains vessel. In some embodiments, the portion of the arrangement which rests upon the foundation may be formed of several levels of repository chambers to form a stack which may accommo date a multiplicity of remains vessels. In further embodi ments, two such stacks may be arranged side by side to double the capacity of the interment arrangement, and render it suitable for interring the victims of battles or catastrophes. Each such repository chamber is provided with a respective cover which may be affixed to the monument by any of several known means. A still further embodiment of the invention is disclosed for interring the remains of several deceased persons, in respective remains vessels, in a single large repository chamber.
