## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN CATALYSIS This invention concerns improvements in catalysis and provides novel catalysts, their production and catalytic processes utilising such catalysts. It has previously been proposed to use zeolites, such as the synthetic zeolite ZSM 5, in the conversion of ketones to aromatic hydrocarbons. It has also been proposed, in British Patent No.1 446 522, to use a known crystalline alumino silicate zeolite having a silica alumina ratio of at least 12 and having pores of about 5 to 10 i in diameter, to catalyse the conversion of oxygencontaining organic compounds to low molecular weight aromatics.Such zeolites may be natural mineral zeolites or synthetic zeolites having the requisite properties specified in the patent, of which the most important appears to be that of pore size. It is believed that the synthetic zeolite ZSM 5 is formed by the formation of a gel type precipitate which is crystallised by heating to give a zeolite having an analytical molar ratio of NazO Al 03 SiO2 0.33 1.00 26.3 the Na cations may be exchanged for H using HC1 to give an acidic form of analytical molar ratio of Na2 0 A1203 SiO2 0.022 1.00 43.6. We have now discovered novel catalysts which are not zeolites but have certain similarities in utility thereto while offering a number of advantages. The present invention provides a catalyst comprising a microporous glass having a deposit on the surface of the pores of an alumina, an alumina silica or a hydrate thereof and having a majority of pores in the size range 5 to 6 The invention also provides a method of producing a catalyst according to the invention comprising impregnating a microporous glass with a precursor for an alumina or an alumina silica in an amount sufficient to give a catalyst having a majority of pores in the size range 5 to 6 A diamater, and converting the precursor into the desired alumina or alumina silica or hydrate thereof. The microporous glasses used in the present invention are generally those having pore sizes in the range 20 to 200 i and have the necessary structural strength and stabelity to act as a support under the conditions of use of the catalyst as well as being of chemical stability whe the alumina or alumina silica is deposited thereon. It is preferred that the pores of the glass are substantially uniform in size and shapes so that the catalyst prepared according to the invention also has uniforn pores. Preferred pore sizes in the glass are in the range 30 to 60A preferred glass is known as controlled pore glass. Controlled pore glass is commercially available and is in the form of rigid glass beads honeycombed with a multiplicity of pores of very uniform size. It is believed that it is prepared by etching out the borates from a borosilicate glass.Controlled pore glass is available in a variety of pore sizes down to 40 i and is recommended for use in exclusion chromatography. It is believed that the high degree of uniformity of pore size in the controlled pore glass is maintained in the catalysts of the present invention leading to very substantial advantages in uniformity of catalytic activity and control of the products. Natural and synthetic zeolites do not exhibit such uniformity of pore size. The deposit of silica or silica alumina may be carried out in a single step or by building up two or more layers to the desired pore size. If two or more layers are deposited, they need not be identical in composition, providing the topmost layer is the desired alumina or alumina silica or hydrate thereof. While the deposition of alumina may be carried out in any desired manner, a preferred method is to absorb aluminium sec butoxide, which may be in the presence of a solvent such as sec butanol, on the catalyst support.Any solvent is then driven off and the sec butoxide is converted to amorphous aluminium oxide hydrate by hydrolysis, for example by exposure to wet steam at 1000C. Preferably the catalyst is then heat treated, e.g. at 4000 C, to yield a deposit of partially hydroxylated alumina on the support. Different crystal forms of alumina can be prepared by ageing for different times at different temperatures up to about 6000C. If an alumina silica deposit is desired, the requisite molar ratio of aluminium to silicon has to be provided. A preferred method is to impregnate the support with the previously calculated quantity of silicon tetrachloride in aluminium sec butoxide solution, and then to hydrolyse and age as described above. The present invention also includes catalysts as previously described in admixture with or in train with other catalysts.Furthermore, the catalysts according to the invention may be impregnated with a metal or metals having specific. catalytic activity, to alter the product slate obtainable and or to enable conversion to be carried out at lower temperature. Such additional metals are preferably used in amount of up to 10 by weight and include zinc, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, cobalt, nickel, platinum or palladium. These metals may be impregnated onto the catalyst of the invention by methods which are known per se for the production of catalysts such as hydrocracking catalysts on alumina supports, involving impregnation by a salt of the metal and conversion by calcining to the corresponding oxide. Although the action of the small pore catalysts of the invention is not clear, and we do not wish to be limited to any theory, it is believed that the small pores physically restrict the size of molecules formed to those of mononuclear aromatics and lower aliphatics, and that there are significant electrostatic effects in the pores. It is believed, however, that for the conversion of oxygen containing organics, and analogous compounds such as thiols, by dehydration or decarboxylation, it is advantageous for the surface of the alumina or alumina silica to be hydroxylated to a suitable extent The catalysts according to the invention are especially suitable for use in reactions in which an oxygen containing organic compound is dehydrated or decarboxylated to a hydrocarbon.Such reactions are conveniently carried out at or close to atmospheric pressure, at a temperature of 250 to 5000C, preferably 300 to 4500C. Suitable starting materials include lower straight or branched chain alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, for example acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde, ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and acetophenone, carboxylic acids, anhydrides and esters thereof, for example acetic acid and anhydride, ethyl acetate, methyl formate, butyric and propionic acids, and ethers such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, isopropyl ether and n butyl methyl ether. The starting materials may comprise straight or branched chain aliphatic groups and may comprise substituted or unsubstituted mononuclear aromatic groups. The starting material need not be a single compound but may be a mixture of compounds or a product stream containing impurities, and in particular may be or may include thio compounds analogous to the oxygen containing compounds mentioned above, and corresponding unsaturated compounds. A particularly preferred starting material is methanol, which may be produced from synthesis gas which itself may be the product of gasification of solid carbonaceous matter including coal, lignite, oil shales and tar sands, as well as hydrocarbons of petroleum origin. The invention includes a process for the production of light hydrocarbons from synthesis gas, either via the intermediate methanol or in which there is no separate step of production of methanol. If there is a separate step of production of methanol this may be a methanol synthesis as known in the art because of the non specificity of the catalyst of the invention separation of a methanol stream need not be undertaken, and a feed resulting fromFischer Tropsch or methanol synthesis which contains a variety of oxygen containing compounds and hydrocarbons may be used.Alternatively, synthesis gas may be fed as or as part of the feed to the catalyst of the invention which catalyst may be a straight catalyst or in admixture with another catalyst which catalyses the conversion of the synthesis gas. The products obtained by the use of the catalysts of the invention and starting materials as described above are a range of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and water. Because of the nature of the catalyst, the hydrocarbon products are those of relatively small molecular size and weight while at the same time less valuable light hydrocarbons, more especially methane, are present in reiatively small amounts, although olefins such as ethylene and or propylene are found in commercially significant quantities. The products are therefore valuable chemical feedstocks and may be separated into individual components for use in chemical synthesis or certain products only, such as the olefins and lower alkanes, may be separated since the remaining hydrocarbons form, without further processing, high grade gasoline boiling range liquid. The invention therefore also provides a process for the preparation of light hydrocarbons which process comprises passing an oxygen containing drganic compound over a catalyst according to the invention at a temperature of at least 2500C. The reaction pressure is not critical and may vary within wide limits from close to O to about 200 bar, although it is convenient to operate at or close to atmospheric pressure. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a polyolefin which process comprises passing an oxygen containing organic compound over a catalyst according to the invention at a temperature of at least 250 C, separating an olefin component from the products thereof and polymerising said olefins under conditions known per se.The main olefin components in the products are formed to be ethylene and propylene these may be polymerised by gaseous or solution polymerisation over a Ziegler Natta catalyst under known conditions, to yield low density or high density polyethylene or polypropylene. The invention will now be described by way of example COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A. A commercially available controlled pore glass Pierce CPG which is essentially a silica skeleton having a pore size of 40 t 12 wag packed into a stainless steel tube reactor which was heated by electrieal resistance windings. When the temperature, as 0 measured by a thermocouple, had stabilised at 400 C, methanol was passed through using a variable positive displacement pump and a micrometer flow control at a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of 0.3. The effluent from the reactor was collected in traps cooled by ice water and by acetone solid carbon dioxide, any remaining gaseous material being passed to a gas burette. The effluent was collected, weighed and analysed. Methanol was recovered in almost 100 yield and no other product was detected. EXAMPLE 1 A weighed mass of controlled pore glass described in ComparativeExample 1 was charged into a vessel which was then evacuated and a pre determined quantity of aluminium sec butoxide, as a solution in sec butanol was slowly added from a hypodermic syringe. The amount of aluminum sec butoxide was sufficient to give a film of amorphous alumina hydrate within the pores to reduce the mean pore diameter to 5 6 A. The solvent present was driven off by heating the vessel at 50 600C under reduced pressure and the alkoxide coated controlled pore glass was exposed to steam at 100 C to hydrolyse the butoxide to amorphous alumina hydrate. A good bond to the controlled pore glass was obtained and studies indicated a good even deposit within the pores. The prepared catalyst was charged into a stainless steel tube reactcr as described in Comparative Example 1, and methanol vapour was fed through at a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of 0.3, 0 operating at a catalyst temperature of 400 C, 100 conversion methanol was achieved. The major product was dimethyl ether in a yield of 60 of theoretical based on methanol conversion and gases containing ethylene and propylene, and water. Operation at higher temperatures, for example at 4500C, also gave 100 conversion of the feed methanol and also the virtual disappearance of dimethyl ether a mixture of hydrocarbons including benzene, toluene, xylenes, isobutane and C9 and C1O aromatics was obtained. EXAMPLE 2 A catalyst was prepared as described in Example 1 above, except that the steam passage over the coated controlled pore glass was continue until the alkoxide had been converted to the microcrystallene hydrate pseudoboehmite as demonstrated by X ray powder diffraction data. Complete conversion of the methanol was achieved at temperatures of 4000C and 4500C, the major products being identified as aromatic hydrocarbons including toluene, benzene, durene, xylene, ethylene and propylene, and water. EXAMPLE 3 A catalyst was prepared as described in Example 2 above except that the steam passage over the coated controlled pore glass was continued until the alkoxide had been converted to the crystalline monahydrata, pseudoboehmite, as demonstrated by X ray powder diffraction data. Complete conversion of the methanol was achieved at temperatures of 4000C and 4500C, the major products being toluene, xylene, mesitylene, isobutene, ethylene and propylene and water. EXAMPLE 4 A catalyst was prepared as described in Example 2 but instead of using it directly it was heat treated at 4500C for 8 hours to yield an oxide identified as alumina by X ray diffraction .Thereafter methanol vapour was passed over it as described inExample 1, and complete conversion was achieved at temperatures of 4000C and 4500C to yield, as major products, toluene, durene, isobutene and propylene. EXAMPLE 5 A catalyst was prepared as described in Example 1, but instead of using aluminium sec butoxide solution, a solution of silicon tetrachloride and aluminium sec. butoxide in sec. butanol was used. After hydrolysis the coated controlled pore glass was heat treated at 6000C for 8 hours to yield a catalyst having a silica alumina ratio of 15 and a mean pore diameter of 82. The catalyst was effective at 4000C in completely converting methanol to hydrocarbons and water. The principal hydrocarbons were toluene, xylenes, Cg aromatics and C10 aromatics and C2, C3, C4 and Cs aliphatics. EXAMPLE 6 The catalysts of above Examples 1 to 3 are used to convert propionaldehyde, acetal, acetic acid and butyl acrylate instead of methanol. Complete or virtually complete conversion of the starting material is achieved, and the products are branched chain alkyls and substituted benzenes boiling in the gasoline range. ResearchOctane Numbers of about 70 are obtained without further processing thereof.
