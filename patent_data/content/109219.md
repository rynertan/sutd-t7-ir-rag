# THRUST REVERSING APPARATUS FOR A GAS TURBINE ENGINE

## Abstract
A thrust reversing apparatus is arranged to divert gas flow through a cascade outlet 22 from a duct 13 defined between an engine centre body 10 and an engine cowling portion 15 . The cowling portion 15 is movable to a rearward position 16 by an actuator 25, 26, 28 and doors 23 which are secured by hinges 40, 41 to the cowling portions 15 and to an output element 28 of the actuator are coupled by links 24 so as to move to positions 23A which shut the duct 13 downstream of the outlet 22 as the latter is uncovered. Thrust from the actuator 25, 26, 28 is applied cirectly to both the cowling portion 15 and to the hinges 40, 41 of the doors 23 .
