# Electrical connector housing with integral retention mechanism.

## Abstract
The invention is an electrical connector characterized by a plurality of resiliently deflectable fingers 21 which extend outwardly from the connector housing 20 to abut against the shoulder 11 of a coupling ring 10 to captivate the coupling ring shoulder 11 between a shoulder 22 and the deflectable fingers 21 on the housing. This arrangement rotatably mounts the coupling ring 10 to the connector housing 20 .
