# Fluid suspension spring and dampener for vehicle suspension system.

## Abstract
A vibration isolating and damping suspension strut 38 for vehicle undercarriages comprising an elongated cylinder 48 and piston 62 structure wherein the cylinder 48 is divided into opposed chambers 64, 66 which are in communication with each other by passages 96 formed in the piston 62 and in a flow restricting shuttle valve 100 mounted on the piston rod 68 . When the strut 38 undergoes a retraction stroke of the piston 62 to absorb loads silicone fluid is compressed in the opposed chambers 64, 66 and transferred from the chamber 64 opposite the piston rod 68 to the rod side chamber 66 through passages 96 in the piston 62 only. When the strut 38 rebounds or extends its piston rod 68 fluid is forced to flow through passages in the shuttle valve member 100 and the piston flow passages 96 at a more restricted rate. The piston flow passages 96 and the shuttle valve 100 are arranged to direct fluid flow toward the outer cylinder borewall 56 to improve heat transfer to the exterior of the strut 38 and minimize heating of the fluid contained in the cylinder chambers 64, 66 . Alternate embodiments of the suspension strut have spiral fluid transfer grooves formed on the periphery of the piston or on a cylinder sleeve insert member.
