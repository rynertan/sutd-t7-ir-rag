# Spherical spring mounting.

## Abstract
A spherical spring mounting is described comprising a central hub with a part spherical outer surface around which are arranged truncated spherical shells separated by and bonded to elastomer layers. Means are provided for connect ing the hub with a selected shell at different positions around the hub axis so that a selected degree of resilience can be provided to a member mounted to extend along the hub axis. The spring mounting may be used e.g. in a standing frame for a handicapped person.
