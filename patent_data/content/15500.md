# Liquid cooled gas turbine blades and method of cooling the blades.

## Abstract
In apparatus and a method for cooling a gas turbine blade 14 , coolant in a liquid state, such as water, flows from a blade root portion toward an outer blade end portion under centrifugal force through one or more liquid coolant passages 17 travelling longitudinally within the blade 14 , and such liquid flow coolant is introduced through a chan nel 18 to one or more nozzle 20 for converting the liquid flow to a mist. The mist flows from the outer blade end portion toward the blade root portion through one or more mist flow coolant passages 19 and, having absorbed heat includes mist and gaseous vapor, is discharged from the blade into the motive fluid.
