# Method of applying solid plastics labels.

## Abstract
The present invention provides, without the drawbacks accompanied by the use of hot melt adhesives, an attractive, easily recycled labelled container 8 , and a method of making same. The container has a solid polymer label 10 on its underside 22 that is adjacent the container when applied, which is provided with a finite area 65 on its leading edge 25 and a finite area 66 on its trailing edge 27 , by applying thereto a solvent for the polymer in each of the finite areas, the finite areas 65, 66 comprising a viscous tacky solution of the polymer in the solvent, the solidifying solution being sufficient to tack and bond the lavel 10 to container 8 during wrapping. After the label is wrapped around the container, the bond between the container and label becomes weaker as the solidifying solu tion hardens so that later the label 10 can be easily and cleanly stripped from the container 8 for recycling. The label can be a co extruded plastics label having a first solid polymer layer 20 and another solid polymer layer, the finite areas 65, 66 being applied to the first solid polymer layer 20 .
