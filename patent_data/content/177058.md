# A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR CALCULATING A HISTOGRAM

## Abstract
Histograms of large volume data, e.g. image data, are calculated in at least two phases under the control of a computer 1 , using a first histogram storage 29 with a wast address space and short word length and a second histo gram storage 25 with a limited address space but a long word length. In one or several first phases, a preliminary histogram is generated in the first histogram storage simultaneously, possible overflow items are identified using the second histogram storage. In a final phase, the overflow items are processed in the second histogram storage to update the preliminary histogram in the first histogram storage.
