# Solar energy system.

## Abstract
A solar energy system for transmitting solar energy from space to an earth location and putting it to useful work either as heat or light energy, or by converting it into some other form of energy such as steam or electrical power. A receiver satellite is in polar orbit and a relay satellite is in equatorial orbit, rotating with the earth and therefore stationary with respect to earth location. Solar energy is collected by the receiver satellite through an array of paraboloid collectors and focused by a series of mirrors onto a coherent radiation energy generator, preferably a laser beam generator. The laser beam is directed by an output mirror to another output mirror on the relay satellite which redirects it to a selected earth location. Alternatively, the relay satellite may convert the laser beam to a maser beam to better penetrate clouds, smoke and haze at the earth location. The outlet mirrors on the the two satellites are mounted on gimbals and are power operated under continuous automatic telemetry control between the satellites and the ground to direct the laser or maser beam to the earth location. Provision is made on one of the satellites for modifying the beam through a constructive interference filter or a diffuser expander lens, or both, to regulate the kind of energy and the area covered at the earth location.
