# Handling of media defects of mass storage discs.

## Abstract
A disk drive of a mass storage subsystem includes areas on a disk surface wherein a vendor generated defective sector log, a software generated defective sector log and an alternate sector log are stored. A random access memory RAM stores a copy of the defective sector logs. During a seek operation, firmware tests the defective sector logs in RAM to generate the alternate sector log for that cylinder number. During the read or write operation, the alternate sector log is checked before processing the sector to determine if it is a defective sector. If the sector is defective, the head is positioned to another cylinder at a head and sector address read from the alternate sector log.
