# Roller rail assembly for cargo loading system.

## Abstract
A roller rail assembly for a cargo loading system for loading cargo loaded pallets into a vehicle, such as an aircraft, is removably mounted in a track or channel assem bly 32 having alternate cut out portions 32c and lip portions 32a, 32b . The roller rail assembly includes an elongated rail member 11 which has a tension stud 14 extending substantially normally from the main body of the assembly along the bottom edge thereof, and a support shoulder 15 extending from the main body of the assembly substantially normally thereto above the tension stud and in a substantially opposite direction thereto. Means are pro vided for rotatably mounting pairs of rollers 20a 20b on the main body of the assembly, the rollers being positioned on opposite sides of the track for rotation on an axis substantial ly normal to the longitudinal axis of the track. The rail is removably supported in the track with the tension stud fitted underneath the lip portions of the track. A retainer member 26 has a tension lug 26b extending normally therefrom along the bottom edge thereof and a shear lug 26c spaced above and running in substantially the same direction as the tension lug. With the tension stud of the rail installed under the lips along one side of the track, the retainer member is rotated to bring the tension lug thereof under the lip portions of the opposite side of the track and the shear lug thereof into one of the cut out portions of the track, the retainer member being bolted to the rail in this installed position.
