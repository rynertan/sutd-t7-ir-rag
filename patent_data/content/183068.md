# End nozzle removal and replacement fixture for use with a reconstitutable fuel assembly.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a fixture for removing and replacing an end nozzle of a reconstitutable nuclear fuel assembly while the latter is held stationary in a work station. The fixture 12 includes a movable base 68 adapted to be mounted upon the work station 52 and to be locked split sleeves 92 and wedge pins 94 to the end nozzle 14 . Supported on the base are means reaction pins 140 and gear drive 142 operable to move the base, together with the end nozzle locked thereto, either in a nozzle removing direction away from the work station or in a nozzle replacing direction toward the work station. Reference means spring loaded movable pins 114 and pin locks 116 on the base are provided for use, prior to removal of an end nozzle, in establishing a reference for subsequent replacement of the nozzle at the same axial position relative to the fuel assembly as before removal.
