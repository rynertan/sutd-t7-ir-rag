# Preparation of copper clad laminates.

## Abstract
Copper clad laminates which may be utilized as circuit boards for electronic equipment may be prepared by form ing a composite consisting of at least one sheet of a high profile copper and one sheet of a thermoplastic resin which has a glass transition temperature above about 170 C and thereafter subjecting the composite to an elevated pressure at a temperature in excess of the glass transition tempera ture of the resin to directly bond the resin to the copper. The copper clad laminate will possess excellent characteristics of peel strength and solder dip resistance.
