# Multi channel magnetic transducer head utilizing magnetoresistance effect.

## Abstract
A multi channel magnetoresistance effect type magnetic head has a short wavelength region magnetic head element MR and or MRaux and a relatively longer wavelength region magnetic head element MRcue . The two head elements are provided on a magnetic substrate 1 with each having a mag netic circuit containing a magnetic gap G facing a surface ad jacent to and across from a magnetic recording medium. Each magnetic circuit has a discontinuity portion with a bridging magnetoresistance effect sensing element to magnetically connect the discontinuity portion. The longer wavelength mag netic head discontinuity portion is spaced at a greater distance L2 from the adjacent surface than is the discontinuity portion of the shorter wavelength magnetic head element MR, MRaux .
