## Description
DETERGENT TABLET HAVING A HYDRATED SALT COATING AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THE TABLET The present invention relates to detergent tablets and, in particular, to coated detergent tablets, especially those adapted for use in automatic dish washing machines. Although cleaning compositions in tablet form have often been proposed, these have not with the exception of soap bars for personal washing gained any substantial success, despite the several advantages of products in a unit dispensing or. One of the reasons for this ay be that detergent tablets require a relatively cor..piex manufacturing process. In particular, it is often desirable to provide the tablet with a coating and this adds to the difficulties of manufacture. While tablets without a coating are entirely effective in use, they usually lack the necessary surface hardness to withstand the abrasion that is a part of normal manufacture, packaging and handling. The result is that uncoated tablets suffer from abrasion during these processes, resulting in chipped tablets and loss of active material. Also, especially in the case of highly alkaline tablets such as are useful for use in automatic dishwashing machines, the outer surface of an uncoated tablet may be aggressive to the skin and even somewhat hazardous to handle. In such cases, tablet coating is highly desirable. Finally, coating of tablets is often desired for aestTh.etic reasons, to improve the outer appearance of the tablet er to achieve some particular aesthetic effect. Numerous r.ethods of tablet coating have been proposed, and Pany of those have been suggested for detergent tablets.However, all of these methods have certain disadvantages, as twill be explained below. Polyric coatings for detergent tablets have been proposed in, for example, U.K. Patent No. 989,683, s. 1,313,686 and No. 1,031,831. Although such coatings can provide excellent surface appearance and resistance to abrasion, they tend to have a lower solubility than is desirable, resulting in the presence of undissolyed polymer in the wash solution. Also, polymeric coatings are difficult to apply frequently it is necessary to use orgarIc solvents with the resultant difficulty and inconvenience of removing these solvents.Where the poiymer can be applied from aqueous solution there is again a problem of drying, the removal of excess water requiring prolonged heating of the tablet. inorganic salt coatings have also been proposed inU.K. Patent No. 1,031,831. The preferred coating material is sodium silicate solution. Again, an aqueous solution is applied to the tablet and this of course requires a drng step to remove the water before the coating is formed. part from the added complexity of a drying step, there is the further disadvantage that migration of excess water unto the table may adversely affect the properties, especially solubility and storage stability, of the tablet. It has also been proposed, for example in our Co pending European patent application No. 78 200014.5, to employ molten organic materials for coating detergent tablets. Materials such as fatty alcohols, fatty acids and pQly.ethylene glycols are said to be useful. While such materials do form good coatings and avoid many of the disadvantages mentioned above, they in turn have the disadvantage of influencing the performance of compositions or of dissolving too slowly. In particular, when we are concerned with tablet for use in automatic dishwashing machines, it is important that the compositions have little or no foaming ability.Materials such as polyethylene glycol have sufficient surface activity to produce excess foaming in such compositions, while a material like a fatty acid can adversely affect detergency performance or can even deposit on the articles being washed. It is an object of the present invention to provide a detergent tablet with a coating which is easily applied and which does not suffer from the problems discussed above. This and other objects are achieved by the use of certain hydrated salts as coating material for the tablets, the salts being applied in the form of a melt. Molten hydrated salts have been proposed for coating bleach particles see U.K. Patent No. 1,191,356 and U.S. PatentNo. 4,048,351 , but it has not heretofore been recognised that detergent tablets could be coated in this manner with such surprisingly advantageous results. According to the present invention, there is provided a detergent tablet having a core comprising an alkaline builder salt and provided with a coating of a hydrated salt having a melting point in the range of from 300C to 950 C, said coating having been applied to the tablet in the form of a melt. In the context of the present invention, the term detergent does not necessarily imply the presence of a surfactant material. Tablets which exert their cleaning power solely by the presence of inorganic salts such as phosphate and silicate are encompassed within the present invention. The term melt will be defined hereinafter. The present invention also provide a process f6r coating a detergent tablet comprising appylng to the tablet a hydrated salt in the form of a melt, said hydrated salt having a melting point in the range from 30 C to 950C. In one embodiment of the present invention, a particulate, absorbent carrier material is dispersed in the coating of the tablet. The carrier material has previously been loaded with a liquid, organic material, preferred organic materials being either nonionic surfactant or silicone suds suppressor. This allows incorporation of small amounts of liquid organic materials into the tablet without adversely affecting the strength solubility characteristics of the tablet. The Detergent Tablet The detergent tablet which is to be provided with a coating according to the present invention can be of any type and can, for example, be adapted for laundry washing, dishwashing or. any other type of cleaning operation which involves dissolution of the table in an aqueous medium. In the body of the tablet is included an alkaline salt, preferably a water soluble builder salt which normally provides a substantial part of the cleaning power of the tablet. The term builder salt is intended to mean all aterials which tend to remove calcium ion from solution, either by ion exchange, complexation, sequestration or precipitation. preferred above all other salts for the purpose of providing alkalinity are water soluble silicate salts. Examples of suitable silicates are those having the genera formula nSiO2.M2O where n is from 0.5 to 4.0 and M is a cation imparting water solubility to the salt, preferably an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium.Such silicates can contain up to 50 by weight of water in tb.. form of water of hydration. Preferred materials zZe s oiun metasilicate and sodium sesquisilicate. Sodium orthosilicate may be used where very high alkalinity is desired. Soim metasilicate is very highly preferred.In prefer ccmpositions intended for use in automatic dish hint machines, the silicate salt inclusive of any walter of hydration makes up more than 50 of the tablet, preferably from 60 to 80 . In compositions design for laundry use, there is usually much less silicate, for example 5 to 15 . Another preferred builder salt, usually employed in combinction ith the silicate salt although possibly employed as the sole builder salt , is a water solable phosphate. .ny water soluble phosphate salt can be employed in the present invention, for example, sodium orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate or more condensed phostates such as hexametaphosphate. Condensed phosphtes are preferred, especially sodium tripolyphosphate. The phosphate salt can be in at least partially hydrated for, particular examples being pentasodium tripolyphcsphate hexahydrate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate decahydrate. In preferred compositions, especially for dishwashing products, the phosphate salt inclusive of any hydrated water makes up from 10 to 40 , preferably from 20 to 30 of the tablet. Other useful inorganic alkaline builder salts, which can be employed alone, or preferably in admixture with the silicate and phosphate salts include water soluble carbonates, bicarbonates and borates. Water soluble organic builder components may also be employed. Examples of suitable organic detergency builder salts are 1 water soluble amino polyacetates, e.g., sodium and potassium ethylene diamine tetra acetates, nitrilotriacetates, and N 2 hydroxyethyl nitrilodiacetates 2 water soluble salts of phytic acid, e.g., sodium and potassium ph tates and 3 water soluble polyphosphonates, including alkali metal salts of ethane 1 hydroxy 1,l di phosphonic acid methylenediphosphonic acid, ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, nitrilotrimethylene phosphonic acid and the like. Additional organic builder salts useful herein include the polycarboxylate materials described in U.S.Patent No. 2,264,103, including the water soluble alkali metal salts of mellitic acid. The water soluble salts of polycarboxylate polymers and copolymers such as are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,308,067, incorporated herein by reference, are also suitable herein. A further class of builder salts useful herein is the water insoluble silicate type which functions by cation exchange to remove polyvalent mineral hardness and heavy metal ions from solution. A preferred builder of this type has the formulation Na A102 SiO2 y.xH2O.wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5 and x is an.integer of from about 15 to about 264. Compositions incorporating builder salts of this type form the subject of British Patent No. 1,429,143 published March 24., 1976,German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,433,485 publishedFebruary 6, 1975 and Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,525,778 published January 2, 1976, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Detergent tablets for use in the present invention can contain a water soluble surfactant selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and cationic surfactants. Surfactants of these types are described inU.S. Patent No. 3,929,678 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Laundry detergent tablets normally contain up to 15 Z of an anionic surfactant such as C8 C18 alkyl benzene sulphonates, C8 C18 alcohol sulphates, C8 C18 alcohol ethoxylate sulphates and fatty acid soaps. Tablets designed for use in automatic dishwashing machines can contain no surfactant, but frequently contain up to 10 of a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants which are advantageously employed in the composition of tis invention include, but are not limited to, the following polyoxyalkylene nonionic detergents C8 C22 normal fatty alcohol ethylene oxide condensates, i.e., condensation products of one sle of a fatty alcohol containing from 8 to 22 carbon atoms with from z to 20 moles of ethylene oxide, polyoxypropvlene polyoxyethylene condensates having the formula HO C2H4O X C3H60 y C2H4O xtH where y equals at least 15 and C2H4O X x , equals 20 90 of the total weigh of the compound and alkyl polyoxypropylenepolyoxyethylene condensates having the formula RO C3H6O x C2H4O yH whereR is a C1 Cl5 alkyl group and x and y each represent an integer of from 2 to 98. Preferred nonionic surfactants for automatic ish washing machine detergent tablets have very low s5sing ability. The afore mentioned polyoxyethylene polyoxy propylene surfactants are especially suitable in this respect. Specific surfactant materials which are preferred include Pluronic L 61, Lutensol LF 700 and the Plurafac series, especially Plurafac RA 40, RA 43 and RA 323. Also useful in the present invention are the polyethylene glycols, for example those of molecular .. eight from 1,000 to 20,000, especially about 10,000. While these materials are not normally considered as surfactant materials, they do assist in improving the wetting ability of the compositions and they are also useful as processing aids in the tablet manufacture. Detergent tablets of the present invention also pre ferably include a bleach component, preferably a chlorine bleach hen a dishwashing composition is desired and an oxygen bleach when a laundry tablet is intended. Any of many kn chlorine bleaches can be used in the present tablet.Examples of such bleach compounds are chlorinated trisodlcn phosphate, dichloroisocyanuric acid, salts of chlorine substituted isocyanuric acid, 1,3 dichloro 5,5 di methylhxcantoin, N,N dichlorobenzoylene urea, paratoluene sulphodichloroamide, trichloromelamine, N chloroammeline, N chlorosuccinimide, N, N dichloroazodicarbonamide, N chloroacetyl urea,N,N dichlorobiuret,chlorinated dicyandiamide, sodium ., ochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, and lithium hypochlorite. The preferred bleach is an alkali metal salt of dichlorcisocyanuric acid, e.g., potassium or sodium dichlo roisocya . rate especially sodium dichloroisocyanurate dihydrate. Useful oxygen bleaches include sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate and sodium persulphate. Neutral fillers such as sodium sulphate and sodium chloride can be present and various other components can be include for various purposes. Examples of such additional components are enzymes, especially proteases and amylases, which are useful in the absence of chlorine bleach , sudssuppressing agents, tarnish inhibitors such as benzotriazole, bactericidal agents, soil suspending agents, dyes, brighteners and perfames. Tablets to be coated in the present invention can be prepared simply by mixing the solid ingredients together and compressing the mixture in a conventional tablet press as used, for example, in the pharmaceutical industry. Any liquid ingredients, for example the surfactant or suds suppressor, can be incorporated in a conventional manner into the solid particulate ingredients. Preferably the principal ingredients, silicate and phosphate, are used in granular farm, Alternatively, especially for laundry tablets, the ingredients such as builder salt and surfactant can be spray dried in a conventional manner and then compacted at a suitable pressure. A suitable process for manufacturing detergent tablets is described in U.S. Patent 3,081,267, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention is particularly applicable to the automatic dishwashing machine tablets described in the copending European patent application No. 78 200014.5.The tablets are highly alkaline and have a high density of at least l.4g cc and preferably about 1.5g cc, for example 1.6 1.7. Where the invention is applied to such tablets, it is highly preferred that the compressed tablet itself is free of liquid organic materials such as nonionic surfactant and suds suppressor e.g. silicone suds suppressor and that these organic materials are incorporated into the coating as hereinafter described. The detergent tablets can be made in any size or shape and can, if desired, be surface treated before coating according to the present invention. For example, it may be desired to water spray the surface as described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,081,267 to provide added surface integrity during subsequent handling steps.The Coating However the detergent tablets are prepared and in whatever form they are, they are then coated according to the present invention with a hydrated salt having a melting point of from 300C to 950C. It is an essential part of the present invention that the coating is applied in a state wherein it essentially solidifies on the tablet rather than dries on to it. It is therefore essential that the salt be applied at a temperature in excess of its melting point. Clearly salts having a melting point below 300C are not sufficiently solid at ambient temperatures and it has been found that salts having a melting point above about 950C lose their water of hydration so quickly after melting that it is not practicable to use these materials. Preferably, the salts melt in the range from 350C to 750C, more preferably from 450C to 700C. By melting point is meant the temperature at which the salt when heated slowly in, for example, a capillary tube becomes a clear liquid. It will be understocd that this is the point at which the salt dissolves in its own water of crystallisation. Solidification of this salt does not involve any loss of water, as the crystalline hydrate is again formed. Any salt having a melting point in the required range and forming a hydrated species can be employed. This includes both inorganic and organic salts. Suitable materials include sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium metaborate tetrahydrate, or octahydrate, sodium orthophosphate dodecahydrate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, the di , depta , or dodeca hydrate of sodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate, potassium aluminium sulphate dodecahydrate, calcium bromide hexahydrate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate. Highly preferred materials are the sodium acetate and the sodium metaborate tetrahydrate. Mixtures of these trgDterials is proportions of metaborate acetate by weight of from 3 1 to 1 3, preferably 2 1 to 1 2, are still more preferred. When the above mentioned hydrated salts are heated to an appropriate temperature, they form a clear liquid phase and detergent tablets of the type described above are coated with the molten hydrated salt. The molten salt can be applied to the tablet in any convenient way, for example by spraying or dipping. Normally, when the molten salt is sprayed on to the tablets, it will solidify almost instantaneously to form a coherent coating. When tablets are dipped into the molten salt and then removed, the rapid cooling again causes almost instantaneous solidification of the coating material. Certain of the hydrated salts form melts which tend to be too viscous for easy spraying. Also, the heating of the salt tends to drive off part of the water of hydration, thus also increasing viscosity and tending to cause prema ture crystallisation of the salt. This can be avoided by adding a small amount of water to the molten salt and, in the context of the present invention, the term melt is intended to mean both the true molten hydrated salt and the molten salt when diluted with water. However, it should be understood that the diluted molten salt will still behave as a molten phase,i.e. it will, on cooling, solidify without the need for substantial drying or removal of excess water. normally, any water added to the melt should not exceed 30 by weight of the melt, preferably not more than 20e, for example from 5 to 15 . The presence of a slight excess of water can provide d further advantage in that migration of this water into the tablet results in an increase in tablet strength. A coating of any desired thickness can be applied according to the present invention. For most purposes, the coating forms from 1 to 10 , preferably from 1.58 to 5 , of the tablet weight. The tablet coatings of the present invention are very hard and yet still highly soluble, are more stable than many organic coatings and are neutral two tablet solubility and performance. Apart from the above mentioned water, the coating melt can contain minor quantities of other ingredients, for example, dyestuffs, perfume, opacifier, suds suppressor, surfactant especially nonionic surfactant , etc. In one preferred embodiment, the surfactant and or suds suppressor is incorporated into the coating in the following manner. In general terms, an organic, liquid material can be incorporated into the tablet of the present invention by a sorbing the liquid material into a solid, particulate carrier material, b dispersing the loaded carrier material in the molten coating material and c applying the coating material in the manner described above. This method can be used for the incorporation of any organic, liquid material but is especially preferred for incorporating either a liquid, nonionic surfactant or a liquid suds suppressor, especially an emulsifiable silicone suds suppressor as described in German OffenlegungsschriftNo. 26 46 127, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. It has been found that direct incor poration of such organic materials into the tablet itself can adversely affect the strength solubility characteristics of the tablet, especially if high density tablets are desired. Any suitable carrier material can be used. This includes inorganic salts such as socium carbonate and sodium phosphates, e.g. sodium tripolyphosphate inorganic materials such as absorbent silicas and zeolites and certain organic resins or natural organic polymers such as starch. Especially preferred materials are aluminosilicates, for example the synthetic material known as zeolite A and having the formula Na12 A102.5i02 12.27H20. In general, the aluminosilicate materials described in U.K.Patent Specification No. 1,429,143 can be employed, as can the aluminosilicate material sold by Sifrance under the trade name DG 12. In general, it is desirable to load as much of the organic liquid on to the carrier material as possible so as to minimise the amount of carrier material in the coating.With aluminosilicate carriers, for example, it has been found that the carrier material can absorb from about 10 to 40 by weight of silicone suds suppressor or nonionic surfactant. The loaded carrier material can be suspended in the coating melt at a level of up to about 50 by weight of the mixture. Another method of incorporating surfactant and or suds suppressor into the inorganic melt coating is to emulsify the organic liquid into the inorganic meltwith the help of a hydrotrope material such.as sodium cumene sulphonate, sodium toluene sulphonate, sodium or potassium xylene sulphonate or a phosphate ester as described in BritishPatent No. 1,485,316. The following Examples illustrate the present inventionEXAMPLE 1 Granular sodium metasilicate 34.0g. , granular sodium tripolyphosphate 12.0g. , sodium aluminate 0.08g. and sodium dichloroisocyanurate 1.lug. were blended together in a mixing vessel to form a homogeneous particulate mixture.About 23 g. of this mixture were introduced into a mould of triangular shape with equilateral triangle sides of 3.3 cm and were compressed in this mould under a pressure of about 470Kg sq. cm to give a tablet of about 1.9 cm tickness and a density of about 1.7 g cc. Sodium metaborate tetrahydrate. 60 parts and sodium acetate trihydrate 40 parts were mixed in a stainless steeel container and heated to 900C with gentle stirring until molten. The molten product was a clear liquid with a viscosity of about 15 cP. The melt was then sprayed on to the tablet prepared as aboveto give a final coated tablet weight of 24.2g.EXAMPLE 2 Following the procedure of Example 1, a tablet was prepared and the melt of sodium metaborate and sodium acetate was made. To this melt 100 parts was added 5 parts of water and the diluted melt was sprayed as before to give a coating of 58 of the tablet weight. The above procedure was repeated by using 10 parts of water to dilute the melt. This made it easier to spray the melt and avoided a tendency for blockage of the spray nozzle. The coated tablets of Examples 1 and 2 are especially suitable for use in automatic dishwashing machines and have an excellent, strong, water soluble coating.EXAMPLE 3 Similar results are obtained when the procedures ofExamples 1 and 2 are followed, but using as the melt material any one of the following sodium acetate trihydrate, sodium metaborate tetrahydrate, sodium orthophosphate dodecahydrate, sodium potassium tartrate and potassium aluminium sulphate. EXAMPLE 4 A spray dried granular detergent composition has the following composition Parts Parts sodium tripolyphosphate 28 28 Sodium alkyl benzene sulfonate 20 Sodium sulfate Sodium silicate having an SiO2 n to Na2O ratio of 2 1 14 Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 0.7 Optical brightener 0.14 A 1 1 mixture of Pluronic F68 and condensation products of ethylene oxide and the reaction product of propylene oxide and prcoylene glycol.They have molecular weights of abut 8i00 and 3000 respectively A mixture of hydrogenated fish oil fatty acids a sleds depressor described in British Patent 808,945 2.8 Moisture 4 990 parts of this spray dried composition are uniformly mixed with 840 parts of anhydrous granular sodium tripolyphosphate and 2 parts by weight of perfume are sprayed on the mixture. An aliquot of the mixture is charged into a tablet cavity and formed under a pressure bf 5 kg sq.cm into a tablet. The tablet is then coated with a mixture of sodium metaborate and sodium acetate according to the procedures of Examples 1 or 2. The coated tablet is suitable for use as a laundry detergent tablet. Substantially similar results are obtained when the materials indicated in Example 3 are used as coating agents. EXAMPLE 5 The procedure of Example 1 is repeated except that the tablet was dipped into the melt of sodium tetraborate and sodium acetate and then removed. The melt solidified quickly at ambient temperature and a coated tablet was obtained having a coating weight of about 5 of the total tablet weight.EXAMPLE 6 A silicone suds suppressor 0.3 parts was sorbed on to 1.2 parts of a zeolite A having a particle size of 5 microns and the loaded carrier material was then suspended in 3 parts of a coating melt as described in Example 1. The melt containing the suspended particulate carrier material was then sprayed on to the tablet of Example 1 to give a tablet with a 4.5 weight of coating. Using an analogous method, a coated tablet containing 0n3t of a nonionic surfactant can be prepared.
