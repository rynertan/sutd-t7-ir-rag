# VALVES

## Abstract
The present invention, there is provides a valve compris ing a flexible sleeve having first and second axially spaced sleeve portions 7, 8 first and second coaxially disposed, relatively angularly movable rings 2, 16 relative to which the first and second sleeve portions 7, 8 are respectively fixed and means 1 for mounting the first and second rings around an opening through which the flow of material is to be controlled by the valve wherein the first and second rings form parts of an epicyclic gear mechansim and wherein means 32, 34 are provided for effecting angular movement of part of the epicyclic gear mechanism between a first position corresponding to a fully closed position of the valve and a second position corresponding to a fully open position of the valve, said epicyclic gear mechanism producing an increased angular relative movement of the rings 2, 16 for a given angular movement produced by said angular movement effecting means 32, 34.
