## Description
AMINE TERMINATED POLYBUTADIENE COMPOSITIONS AND PREPARATION THEREOFBackground of the Invention The present invention is directed to novel amine terminated polybutadiene compositions and to methods for the preparation of such compounds involving reacting an alkane or arenesulfonate ester with a primary amine or ammonia. Diamino terminated compounds containing sulfur dispersed in the carbon carbon chain are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,388,107.U.S. Patent 4,015,061 describes the preparation of N,N bis trialkylsilyl amino terminated polymers by treating a lithio N,N bis trialkylsilyl aryl amine with a diene monomer which are converted to a mono or di primary aryl amine ended polymer. U.S. PatentNos. 4,070,344 and 4,151,222 describe the preparation of anionically polymerised monomers such as conjugated dienes which are end capped with polyisocyanates or polyisothiocyanates which are then reacted with amide containing compounds to given an imide type end group. The imide type terminated polymer is hydrolysed to form an amine terminated polymer. U.S. Patent No. 4,316,967 describes an amine terminated polymer connected to an epoxy polymer to form a copolymer. The amine terminated polybutadienes of the present invention are easily produced in high yield with a minimum of any side product formation. The amine terminated polybutadienes can be reacted with isocyanates to give polyurea resins or with esters and epoxides to form polyamides and epoxy resins respectively. The amine terminated polybutadienes may also be reacted with various other polymer segments such as polyimides, polyureas, etc., to give block or graft copolymers. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a novel amine terminated polybutadiene compound having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R is hydrogen, a straight or branched chain alkyl group containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or aralkyl group containing one or more benzenoid rings which may be fused or joined by single valency bonds and n is an integer of from about 5 to 1500. Further according to the present invention, there is provided a method for the preparation of the amine terminated polybutadiene compound, the method comprising reacting an alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene having the formula EMI2.2 wherein R is an alkane group containing from 1 to 16 carbon atoms or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group or aralkyl group containing one or more benzenoid rings which may be fused or joined by single valency bonds and n is an integer of from about 5 to 1500, at a temperature of from about 250C to 2000C, preferably from 500C to 1100C, with a primary amine to form a secondary amine terminated polybutadiene or with ammonia at an initial ammonia pressure which will provide at least a stoichiometric amount, and preferably an excess, of ammonia to form a primary amine terminated polybutadiene.Generally the ammonia pressure will range between about 200 psig and 500 psig. Optionally the process is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. The alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene compounds employed in the instant invention may be prepared, for example, by reacting, at a temperature of from about 150C to 150at, preferably between 250C and 500C, optionally in the presence of an inert solvent, a polyhydroxybutadiene homopolymer with an alkane or arenesulfonyl chloride or fluoride in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst. Typical and preferred alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene compounds are the lower alkane compounds such as methane or ethane sulfonate terminated polybutadiene or paratoluene sulfonate terminated polybutadiene. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation in high yield of a secondary or primary amine terminated polybutadiene in a two step procedure of first reacting a polyhydroxybutadiene sold commercially for example by ARCO Chemical Co., a division of Atlantic RichfieldCompany, under the trademark Poly bd R 45T or R 45M with an alkaneor arenesulfonyl chloride or fluoride in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst to form a sulfonate terminated polybutadiene compound which in turn is reacted with a primary amine or ammonia to give the desired amine terminated polybutadiene.Briefly a general postulated equation for the reaction system of the present invention may be represented as follows HO CH2CH CH Ch2 n0H t RS02C1EMI4.1 tb tamine SEP tb catalyst tb polyhydroxybutadiene sulfonyl chloride R SO,OCCH CH CH CH, O S03R CH CH NH 2 2 2n 2 3 2 2 EMI4.2 tb heat tb pressure tb sulfonate terminated polybutadiene primary amine or ammonia EMI4.3 amine terminated polybutadiene In accordance with this aspect of the invention an amine terminated polybutadiene is prepared by a novel two step process which comprises 1 reacting at a temperature of from about 150C to 1500C, optionally in the presence of a solvent, a polyhydroxybutadiene homopolymer with an alkane or arenesulfonyl chloride or fluoride in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst which will react with generated hydrogen chloride to give a tertiary amine hydrochloride to form an alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene and 2 reacting the formed alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene in situ, or after removal from the reaction system with or without purification, at a temperature of from about 250C to 2000C preferable 500C to 1100C with a primary amine to form a secondary amine terminated polybutadiene or with ammonia at an initial ammonia pressure which will provide at least a stoichiometric amount, and preferably an excess of ammonia, to react with the sulfonate compound to form a primary amine terminated polybutadiene. Generally the ammonia pressures will range between about 200 psig and 500 psig.Optionally the process is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. The polyhydroxybutadiene homopolymers employed in the reaction with the alkane or arenesulfonyl chloride or fluoride will have a viscosity range of from about 20 to 390 or up to about 550 poises at 3DO C. .Preferably the homopolymers have a viscosity of about 35 to 60,or up to about lSO to 260 poisEs. Thus, the polyhydroxybutadiene homopolymers are liquid or semi solids flowable, at least when subjected to moderate pressure, at ambient temperatures or at temperatures up to about 2000C. The hydroxyl containing butadiene homopolymers will have molecular weights in the range of about 400 to 25,000 or higher as determined by cryoscopic, ebullioscopic or osomometric methods. The polyhydroxybutadiene hydroxy containing butadiene homopolymers employed in the process differ from diene polymers known to be telechelic and or hydroxy containing in that the majority of unsaturation in the former is in the main hydrocarbon chain and in that the hydroxy components are in predominantly terminal positions on the main hydrocarbon chain and are predominantly primary and allylic in configuration.Ordinarily, at least about 1.8, often at least about 2 or more, frequently 2.1 to 2.8 and up to about 3 or more hydroxyl groups are present on the average per polymer molecule. Since these hydroxyl groups are predominantly primary, terminal and allylic in structure, with approximately two of the hydroxyl groups being at terminating positions on the main carbon chain, the polymers are highly reactive. The dienes which are employed to make the polyhydroxybutadienes include the unsubstituted, 2 substituted or 2,3 disubstituted 1,3 dienes of 4 up to about 12 carbon atoms. The diene preferably has up to 6 carbon atoms and the substituents in the 2 and or 3 position may be hydrogen, alkyl, generally lower alkyl, e.g., of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, aryl substituted or unsubstituted , halogen, nitro, nitrile, etc. Typical dienes which may be employed are 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, 2 cyano 1,3 butadiene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene, 2phenyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 methyl3 phenyl 1,3 butadiene, etc. Although polyhydroxybutadienes of the abovedescribed type, averaging more than one predominantly primary hydroxyl per molecule, say about 1.8 to 3 or more per molecule, may be employed they preferably have an average of at least 2 or more or about 2.1 to 2.4 up to 2.8 hydroxyl groups per molecule and the hydroxyl groups are predominantly in terminal allylic positions on the main, generally longest, hydrocarbon chain of the molecule. By allylic configuration is meant the alpha allylic grouping of allylic alcohol that is, the terminal hydroxyls of the intermediate polymer are attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond carbon. The ratio of cis 1,4 and trans 1,4 and 1,2 vinyl unsaturation which occurs in the diene polymers employed in this invention, the number and location of the hydroxyl groups and the molecular weight of the polymers can be a function of polymerization temperature and the type of addition polymerization system employed in forming the polymer. It has been found that diene polymers of the desired configuration can be obtained using hydrogen peroxide as the catalyst for polymerization in a mutual solvent system. This free radical addition polymerization usually takes place in solution at a temperature above about 1000C. to 2000C. The reaction to form the polyhydroxybutadiene preferably takes place in a mutual solvent system that is, one which dissolves both the diene monomer and the hydrogen peroxide. Suitable solvents in clude isopropanol, methanol, sec butanol, acetone, n butanol, n propanol, methyl ethyl ketone and the like, saturated alcohols or ketones preferably alkanols, having 2 to about 12 carbon atoms. The H202 solvent system is found to supply hydroxyl groups and the catalytic and solvent effects needed to produce the diene polymers of desired chemical and physical characteristics.In such a polymerization system the alcohol or ketone serves as a solvent for the peroxide and as a solvent or diluent for the diene monomer and is used in an amount suitable to promote adequately rapid but controllable polymerization of the monomer material in the solution to form the diene polymers. The solvent will be free of any group which would interfere with the production of the desired diene polymer. Saturated alcohols are pre tarred and often those having about the same carbon atom content as the diene monomer will be found most useful.Thus, propanol or isopropanol is often used in butadiene polymerization. The H202 solvent system may also contain ethers, alcohol ketones, alcohol ethers and alcohol esters which are miscible in water in all proportions and which do not contain polymerizable carbon to carbon unsaturation or otherwise interfere with polymerization or enter into the product. The peroxide material may be used in amounts of about 1 percent to 15 percent of the reaction mixture to assure a low molecular weight addition polymer product having more than two hydroxyl groups per molecule. The alkane or arenesulfonyl chlorides or fluorides employed as reactants to form the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene conform to the general formula R S02C1 or R SO2F wherein R is an alkane group, generally of.l to 16 carbon atoms, or a substituted or unsubstituted aryl or aralkyl group containing one or more benzenoidrings which may be fused or joined by single valency bonds.Representative sulfonyl chlorides or fluorides as hereinabove described include, for example, 3 acetylben enesulfonyl fluoride, benzenesulfonyl chloride, l butanesulfonyl chloride, tbutylbenzenesulfonyl chloride, 4 chlorobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 3 chloropropanesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride or fluoride, ethanesulfonyl chloride or fluoride, 4 fluorobenzene sulfonyl chloride, 2 mesitylenesulfonyl chloride, naphthalenesulfonyl chlorides, nitrobenzenesulfonyl chlorides or fluorides, toluenesulfonyl chlorides or fluorides, 2,4,6 triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride, and the like. The tertiary amine catalysts employed in the formation of. the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene will also act as scavengers to consume the chloride or fluoride ion when hydrogen chloride or fluoride is generated during the reaction of a polyhydroxybutadiene with an alkane or arenesufonyl chloride or fluoride thus forming a tertiary amine hydrochloride or hydrofluoride which may precipitate from solution depending on the solubility of same in the particular solvent that may be employed.Representative tertiary amines suitable for use in the process of the invention include, for example, the trialkylamines such as trimethyl, triethyl, tripropyl, tributyl, trihexyl, trioctyl, tridecyl, tridodecyl and the like, triphenylamine, n dodecyldimethyl amine, n tetradecyldimethylamine, n hexyldecyldimethylamine, N,N,N ,N tetra methylethylenediamine, N,N dioctyl l octylamine, 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane, 4, N,N dimethylamino pyridine, pyridine, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene, methyldiethylamine, butyldimethylamine, benzyldimethylamine polyvinylpyridine and the like. The amount of tertiary amine employed in the process will be at least a 1 1 molar ratio based on the alkane or arenesulfonyl chloride or fluoride and is preferably used in slight excess at, for example, a molar ratio of 1 1.05. Optionally solvents or mixtures of solvents which are stable and substantially chemically inert to the components of the reaction system at reaction temperatures may be employed in the formation of the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene, if desired.The same solvent without removal or a new solvent may also be employed in the conversion to the amine terminated product if desired.Preferably the reactants will be soluble in the solvents employed in order to obtain a convenient rate of reaction. Suitable solvents which may be used in this invention include, for example, alkanes such as hexane, heptane, dimethylhexane, pentane, nonane, decane and the like, alkenes such as pentene, hexene, trimethylpentenes, hexadecene and the like, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, xylene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, diisopropylbenzenes, dibutylbenzenes, substituted benzenes, naphthalenes, and the like, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, diphenyloxide, amides such as dimethylformamide, cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, methyl cyclopentane, ethyl cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cyclooctene, and the like, sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide propylethylsulfoxide, sulfones such as sulfolane, diisopropyl sulfone, etc. The primary amines which may be employed in the reaction with the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene include, for example, ethyl amine, propylamines, allylamine, n amylamina, butyl amines, cyclohexylamine, n tetradecylamine, benzylamine, aniline, toluidines, naphthylamine and the like. The preferred amines are the lower alkylamines such as n butylamine or ethylamine. The formation of the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene may be carried out at a temperature of from 150C to 1500 C, preferably between 250C and 5O0C. However, higher or lower temperatures may be employed if desirable. The conversion to the amine terminated product will proceed at temperatures of from about 250C to 2000C but is preferably carried out at between 50 C and 1100C. Except when ammonia is employed as reactant in the formation of a primary amine terminated polybutadiene, the process of the present invention is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure or the autogenous pressure of the reaction system, although higher pressures may be used and especially at the higher reaction temperatures or when the reaction temperature is above the boiling point of the catalyst, solvent and or reactant. Subatmospheric pressure may be employed if desired. The reactions of the first and second steps may be carried out in any suitable reactor which is generally equipped with means for agitation, means for regulating temperature and pressure if required. Although the order of addition of the reactants and solvents, if any, may vary, a general procedure for carrying out the reaction is to charge the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene into the reaction vessel to which is then added a primary amine or ammonia and heated to the desired temperature and pressure with stirring to form an amine terminated polybutadiene. The reaction may be carried out batchwise or as a semicontinuous or continuous process. Where the two step procedure is used a general procedure is to charge the polyhydroxybutadiene such as ARCO Chemical Co Poly bd R45 HT with the tertiary amine catalyst into the reaction vessel and then add the alkane or arenesulfonyl chloride or fluoride to the mixture to prepare the alkane or arenesulfonate terminated polybutadiene to which is then added a primary amine or ammonia and heated to the desired temperature at atmospheric pressure or higher pressures, if required to form an amine terminated polybutadiene. The reaction products are recovered and treated by any conventional method, such as distillation, evaporation or fractionation to effect separation from unreacted material, solvent, if any, and by products. The reaction time is generally dependent upon the reactants employed, solvent, temperature, pressure, as well as tertiary amine catalyst charged but will generally run for from 3 to 4 hours for the first step and 4 to 8 hours for the second step under batch conditions. 7 The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention in accordance with the principles of this invention but are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way except as indicated by the appended claims.
