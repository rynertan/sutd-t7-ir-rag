## Description
SPECIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTitle of the Invention Process for producing fluorine containing organic compound.Field of the Invention This Invention relates to a process for producing fluorine containing organic compounds.Description of the Prior Art Compounds containing fluorine have versatile useful applications by virtue of their superior stability, chemical resistance, weather resistance, water and oil repellent properties, physiological activity and so on.A variety of studies have been made on the compounds containing the fluorine containing alkyl group within their molecules, and several new synthesizing methods have been hitherto developed. There are reported of the synthesizing methods for the compounds containing trifluoromethyl group, the followings may be mentioned, 1 a method to directly fluorinate the methyl group with metallic fluorides, 2 an halogen exchange reaction on CC13 group with HF SbC15, 3 a method to fluorinate COOH group with SF4, 4 radical reaction to introduce a CF3 group into heterocyclic compounds, 5 a method to substitute iodine which is introduced into aromatic compounds for Rf by means of RfCuI Ullmanntype reaction Rf indicates fluorine containing aliphatic group hereinafter so represents .Further, it is known that the trifluoromethyl magnesium iodide CF3MgI can not be used for trifluoromethylation reaction in that the compound is very unstable due to its property to eliminate MgF2 by readily extracting F because its constituent Mg is highly bondable with F. Among above described synthesizing methods for trifluoromethyl containing compounds, the methods other than the Ullmann type reaction, the reagent for fluorination is highly hazardous, and that its handling is difficult, and that it is hard to optionally introduce the trifluoromethyl group into a desired position in a molecule. Conversely, there is reported that vB teto carboxylic acid ester can be synthesized by applying theReformatsky reaction on ester compounds. However, the reaction is difficult and least successful instances are known upto present. The details are explained as follows Firstly, alpha carboxylic acid ester 1 is caused to react with zinc in accordance with the following reaction, then a Reformatsky type reagent 2 is obtainedEMI3.1 1 R1, Rê alkyl group, 2 R alkyl group X Br In this case, as it is not desirable when the raw material, ester 1 and the product, ester 2 are condensated, andEMI3.2 is produced, it was a prerequisite to handle them without generating the above result or preventing the reaction of both esters .Accordingly, in obtaining an end product ss ketocarboxylic acid ester 4 by subjecting the above described reagent 2 to reaction with a ester compound 3 with the following formula, due to the above prerequisite, it becomes difficult to cause the reaction itself of the ester 2 with the ester 3 . EMI4.1 2 3 R3, R4 R alkyl group EMI4.2 Thus, it is necessary to select an ester that may easily react with the reagent 2 without self condensation between the ester 1 and 2 . This is a reason why there have been almost no success ful experimental results in the synthesizing of the compound as intended. In consequence, even when the fluorine containing ester which is represented by RfCOOR Rf fluorine containing alkyl group is employed as the above described ester compound 3 so as to introduce fluorine into the object compound, it is not easy to obtain a fluorine containing alkyl keto carboxylic acid ester by means of the said Reformatsky reaction. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the primary object of this invention is to present a method that can proceed the reaction for introducing the fluorine containing group into the organic compound in an and safetyunder the normal conditions. The secondary object of the invention is to present a method to synthesize organic compounds containing a fluorine containing aliphatic group such as trifluoromethyl group in particular with good yield and in a stabilized fashion. Further, the third object of the invention is to present a method that can introduce various RfCO groups into the intended compounds at the specified position preferentially and with a high yield rate under mild conditions by applying the Reformatsky reaction. The process of the present invention to produce fluorine containing organic compounds is characterized in the introduction of Rf group into the above said organic compounds by subjecting the fluorine containing aliphatic iodides which are represented by Rft, RfZnI, or RfSnX2I where Rf indicates the fluorine containing aliphatic group X indicates halogen , and organic compounds to reaction under the action of ultrasonic waves. The present invention is related to the process for producing fluorine containing diketones, and characterized, as an application of the Reformatsky reaction, to have 1 a process to generate a metallic halogenated ketone which is represented by the formula EMI5.1 where R aliphatic hydrocarbon oxy group, or aliphatic hydrocarbon group, or fluoro aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may form a ring with the carbon atoms being bonded with X X halogen Y hydrogen atom or fluorine atom and M zinc or magnesium by causing the halogenated ketone represented by the Formula EMI6.1 where R,X and Y are same as the above difinition to reaction with the metal consisting of zinc or magnesium, and to have 2 a process to generate the fluorine containing diketones which represented by the Formula EMI6.2 where R. and Y are as described before, and Rf is fluoroaliphatic hydrocarbon group and includes those containing ether bonds within the chain , by causing the metallic halogenated ketone to react with the fluoroester which is represented by the Formula RfCOOR where Rf is as described above, and R is aliphatic hydrocarbon group or aromatic hydrocarbon group , under the action of ultrasonic waves. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The method of the present invention is exemplified as follows.The fluorine containing aliphatic iodide which is represented by the FormulaRfI where Rf indicates the fluorine containing aliphatic group , and the carbonylic compound which is represented by the Formula RCOR where R and R similar or dissimilar atom or group selected from the group comprising the hydrogen atom, aliphatic group and aromatic group, and can form a ring jointly where both of them are of aliphatic groups , are caused to react under the zinc powder and the halogenated tin powder which is represented by the FormulaSnX2 where X indicates the halogen like chlorine, bromine and iodine, etc. by being subjected to the action of ultrasonic waves. Where the halogenated tin powder is employed, it is effective under the addition of the tertiary amine, in piace of the environment under the action of ultrasonic waves . Following the above reaction, the fluorine containing carbinol which is represented by the Formula EMI7.1 where Rf I R and R are the same as above , by subjecting the reaction product to hydrolysis. Namely, the reaction in accordance with the present invention is capable to synthesize the fluorine containing carbinol with a high yield and in a stabilized fashion, when the raw material Rf I and RCOR undergo reaction, preferably under the presence of the zinc powder and or the halogenated tin powder, within a reactor, under the action of ultrasonic waves, by causing the interaction between molecules, and thereby cross coupling RCOR with RfI, and thereafter causing hydrolysis.This reaction is conjectured that, for instance, where the zinc powder is employed it is similar with the halogenated tin powder , the reaction may proceed as follows RCOR RfIEMI8.1 Ultrasonic wavesEMI8.2 EMI8.3 In this case, it is thought that the above said intermediate product may be produced, in that the Zn powder and or halogenated tin powder produces a stabilized RfZnI and or RfSnX2I by first reacting with the reaction substance, particularly Rf I, and then the product is caused to have a full interaction with RCOR .Namely, with the method of this invention, although the mechanism is not fully clarified at present, it is thought that the interaction between the reaction molecules is made closer with the action of ultrasonic waves as given above, and thereby accelerates the generation of the abovementioned intermediate product.Where the halogenated tin is employed, it is also effective to cause the reaction under the addition of the tertiary amine i.e., pyridine, triethylamine, N, N dimethylaniline instead of the ultrasonic wave. It is thought that the tertiary amine is coordinated at Sn position of RfSnIX2 and activates the Rf Sn bonding.Where the ultrasonic wave or the tertiary amine is not caused to act, it is experimentally confirmed that the reaction does not proceed entirely. What is important with the method of this invention is represented by the employment of Zn and or SnX2 whereX halogens such as chlorine, bromine and iodine, etc. for the above said cross coupling. This reaction appears to be similar to the publicly known Grignard reaction. However, where Mg or Li is employed, RfMgI or RfLi itself is extremely unstable to produce the above said intermediate product, thereby it precludes its use for the synthesizing reagent. In other words, Mg or Li has a strong affinity toward F. Where Mg or Li is caused to react with RfI,MgF2 or LiF is eliminated from RfMgI or Rf Li, resulting in the production of fluoroalkene. Thus the Grignard reagent or RfLi such as RfMgI can not be used for the present invention.This fact indicates the characteristics or speciality of the present invention which introduces fluorine containing aliphatic group. Furthermore, with the method of this invention, the raw material are stabilized respectively, and also the reaction can be implemented within a single reaction vessel under the normal conditions subject to the ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Thereby easier handling is available and most practicable. Fdr the method of this invention, as the usableRfI, the fluorine containing aliphatic iodides which are represented by the Formula, CF3 CF2 I or CF3 2CF CF2 n1 can be counted. These include CF3I, CF3CF2I, CF3 CF2 2I, CF3 CF2 3I, CF3 CF2 4I, CF3 CF2 5I, CF3 2CFI, CF3 2CFCF2I, CF3 2CF CF2 2I and UF3 2CF CF2 3I. Other than these alkyl groups, tile method can use the unsaturated group, especially the iodides consisting of the alkenyl group, such as CF2 CF CF2I and CF3 CF CFI. However, it is advisable that the number of carbon atoms in the fluorine containing aliphatic iodides to be used should be at 10 or less taking into account the solubility against solvents. For the above mentioned fluorine containing aliphatic iodides which can be used, CF3 CF2 2CH2CF2I that is bonded with hydrogen atoms in the molecular chain is usable in addition to the above enumerated perfluoroalkyl group or alkenyl group. In this case, it is necessary thatF should be present adjacent to I. Also diiodides, i.e.,I CF2CF2 nI can be used. Further, other than the aboveRfI, aromatic group substituted iodides, i.e. C6H5 CF2I, C6H5 CF2 2I, may be used. As RCOR to be employed for the method of the present invention, the following compounds may be used 1 aliphatic aldehydes including HCHO, CH3CHO, C2H5CHO, C3H7CHO, C4H9CHO, C5H11CHO, CH2 CHCHO, CH3CH CHCHO, CH3 2C CHCHO, etc. 2 aromatic aldehyde including C6H5CHO, C6H5CH CHCHO, CH3OC6H5CHO 3 aliphatic ketones including CH3COCH31 CH3COC2H51 C4H9 2C0, CH2 2 CHCOCH2CH31 CH3 2C CHCOCH3 4 aromatic ketones including EMI11.1 R and R in RCOR are the similar or dissimilar atom or group, and it is permitted to use the above stated saturated or unsaturatea compounds, in addition to those introduced with a substitute group into their parts.When R and R are of aliphatic groups, it is advisable to limit the number of carbon atoms to 15 or less taking into considerations the solubility into solvents, and also to be capable to form rings jointly, especially cyclohexylic rings. For the method of the present invention, it is preferable to add the above mentioned zinc powder or SnX2 powder within a range of one to three times the number of moles against RfI so as to make the reaction proceed fully and appropriately. These metallic reagents may be used independently or jointly. Where the reagents are used jointly, it is preferable to add the total amount of zinc powder and SnX2 powder within a range of one to three times the number of moles against RfI. It will serve the purpose when the reaction may proceed to the full extent even under the ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, and a range of ultrasonic waves to be obtained with a commercially available ultrasonic cleaner is employed. The tertiary amine which is added under the conditions where the halogenated tin may be of one fifths percentage by volume of an amount of the solvent to be used. Where solvents are used for a reaction system, it is recommended to employ aprotic solvents, such as dimethylformaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, N methyl. pyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoamide, and acetonitrile.These polar solvents have a strong dissolving action in that they have a high solvation energy against cation, and act to increase a reaction rate of anionic reagents.For the method of the present invention, where the initiating substance itself is a liquid, it is not always necessary to use the above mentioned solvents. And for the hydrolysis to obtain carbinol, ordinary mineral acids such as HCl andH2S04 may be used. The inventor has also found out that the following reaction is able to synthesize a fluorine containing carbinol in a stabilized fashion and with a good yield, in addition to the above described synthetic reaction. That is, the method uses RfZnI or RfSflX2I Rf and X are similar to those described before or jointly uses RfZnI and RfSnX2I instead of the above given RfI. f 2 the substance is subjected to reaction with RCOR R andR are similar to those described before particularly under the action of ultrasonic waves where RfSnX2I is employed, it may be put to a reaction under the conditions where the above given tertiaryamine is added .Thence, where the product is subjected to hydrolysis, carbinol can be obtained as in the above described case. This reaction can be represented as follows for a case whereRfZnI is used.RCOR Rf ZnI EMI14.1 EMI14.2 tb Ultrasonic SEP Wave tb EMI14.3 EMI14.4 According to this reaction, it is characteristic to cause Rf ZnI and or Rf SnX2 I which was previously synthesized to react with carbonyl compounds. Also in this case, it is considered that, similar to the above description, the action of the ultrasonic waves or the tertiary amine may cause the closer interaction between reacting molecules, and accelerate the generation of the intermediate product as mentioned before.Namely, due to the coordinate action of the ultrasonic wave energy or the tertiary amine, it is considered that the bonding of Rf Zn or Rf Sn ofRfZnI or RfSnX2I in particular may be made weaker, and the interaction with RCOR may be strengthened, thereby the interaction may proceed to the full extent. RfZnI or RfSnX2I itself which is used well dissolves into the given solvents, and causes the reaction to proceed in an easier manner. And this Rf ZnI or RfSnX2I can be synthesized within an autoclave at a temperature at 120 to 1500C by causing the reaction of the above stated Rf I with Zn or SnX2 powder X halogen .In this case, it is desirable to use an amount of Zn orSnX2 at one to three times the number of moles against RfI.Zn and SnX2 may be used simultaneously, but it is preferable that their total amount is set at one to three times the number of moles against RfI. The solvent to be used for the reaction and the conditions for reaction with carbonyl compounds are to be similar to that of the description previously given. The fluorine containing carbinol which is synthesized according to the method of the present invention is most useful and can be used for the applications as follows 1 the substance itself can be used as a solvent, 2 the. substance can be used as a synthetic intermediate for water or oil repellent agents, medicines, agri cultural chemicals, dyes, surface active substance, etc., 3 the substance can be used as a monomer to produce fluorine containing polymers. For instance, it forms an unsaturated bonding of a monomer by removing OH group and adjacent hydrogen atoms by means of dehydration reaction. The method of the present invention may be based on the following reaction. That is, a fluorine containing aliphatic iodide which is represented by the Formula,RfI where Rf fluorine containing aliphatic group , and a halogen substituted aliphatic unsaturated compound or a halogen substituted aromatic compound is to be subjected to a reaction under the ultrasonic wave action at the presenceof zinc powder and a palladium catalyst. Thereby, introducing the above said Rf into the above multiple bond or the benzene nucleus, an unsaturated aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound which is eleminated of the above said halogen can be obtained. According to this method, where the initiating substance, RfI and a halogen substituted unsaturated aliphatic compound or a halogen substituted aromatic compound are caused to react each other, when these substances are put under the action of ultrasonic waves by bringing them into contact with the palladium catalyst under the presence of the zinc powder, the interaction between the reacting molecules is made closer with the ultrasonic wave energy, thereby RfI is efficiently cross coupled with the abovestated multiple bonding position or carbon atoms of the benzene nucleus, and finally it is possible to obtain with a good yield a product which is introduced with the fluorinecontaining aliphatic group Rf under the condition of dehalogenation. Inthis case, firstly the Zn powder reacts with RfI, resulting with the stabilized RfZnI, and also reacts by maintaining the full interaction with the halogen substituted unsaturated aliphatic compound or aromatic compound which is activated under the action of the palladium type catalyst. Conversely, where the palladium type catalyst is is not used and the ultrasonic wave is not put into action, it is ascertained that no reaction does proceed. It is considered that the above described reaction may proceed as below, where the halogenated allyl is employed instead of the above stated halogenated aliphatic unsaturated compound.EMI17.1 tb Ultrasonic SEP wave, SEP Zn tb SEP Tetrahydrofuran SEP RZnI tb SEP 5 tb SEP Palladium SEP Catalyst SEP R tb RfZnI SEP SEP R SEP SEP Ultrasonic SEP Wave tb SEP 5 SEP 6 SEP 7 tb That is., with the reaction of RfI with Zn, the intermediate product 5 i.e. perfluoroalkyl zinc iodide is generated, and the perfluoroalkylated substance 7 of a halogenated allyl is produced through smooth reaction of the halogenated allyl 6 where R alkyl group X halogen with the intermediate product 5 within the said solvent in situ under the contact with the palladium tpe catalyst. This perfluoroalkyl group is introduced into the position of the halogenated allyl 6 under the dehalogenation X condition at a probability of 95 or greater in a positionselective fashion, and thereby the desired product 7 bonded selectively at the gamma position with Rf can be obtained with a good yield. As the palladium type catalysts to be used for this reaction, various types of them were tried. Namely, various palladium . type catalysts were applied at the reaction for instance, of trifluoromethyl zinc iodide corresponding to the above 5 and cinnamyl bromide corresponding to the above 6 . It was found out that the palladium acetate Pd OAc 2 was particularly best suited to the aspect of yield of the product as indicated on the following Table 1.

For this method, as a usable RfI, it can include the fluorine containing aliphatic iodides which are represented by the Formula, CF3 CF2 nI or CF3 2 F2 nI. Included are CF3I, CF3CF2I, CF3 CF2 2I, CF3 CF2 3I, CF3 CF2 4I,CF3 CF2 5I, CF3 2CFI, CF3 2CFCF2I, CF3 2CF CF2 2I, and CF3 2CF CF2 3I, etc. In addition to these alkyl groups, unsaturated groups, particularly, the iodides consisting of alkenyl groups1 for instance, CF2 CF CF21 and CF3 CF CFI may be used.Provided that the number of carbon atoms of the fluorinecontaining aliphatic iodides to be used is preferred to be at 10 or less in consideration of the solubility against solvents. Further, as the said fluorine containing aliphatic iodides, in addition to the above enumerated perfluoroalkyl group or alkenyl group, CF3 CF2 2CH2CF2I which is bonded with the hydrogen atoms at a part of the molecular chain may be used. In this case, it is necessary that F is present adjacent to I. Also, diiodides such as I CF2CF2 nI may be used.Further, in addition to the above said Refit aromatic groupsubstituted iodides such as c6Hs cF21 and C6H5 CF2 2I may be used. And as the usable halogenated aliphatic unsaturated compounds, including the above mentioned allyl bromides, halogenated allyl compounds or their derivatives which are represented by the following Fomula may be included.EMI19.1 where R, R and R indicate an hydrogen atom, alkyl group or alkenyl group, having carbon atom numbers of 10 or less than 10, aromatic group or aromatic group substituted with substituents, X halogens such as Br, I and Cl. Here, as R, R and R , the alkyl groups such as methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group and alkenyl groups which have unsaturated bond partially may be applied. But it is preferable to let the number of carbon atoms at 10 or less. Also, as the substituent to be introduced into the above stated substituted aromatic group, it is necessary to employ the substituents which will not affect the development substantially in the dehalogenating reaction. As such substituent, alkyl group or alkenyl group may be adopted. In this case, the number of carbon atoms therein is preferred to be limited to 5 or less.And, other types of substituents to be introduced into these aromatic groups may be of aryl group, halogens such as C1, nitro group, cyano group, and alkoxy group. Also, it is possible to use the halogenated vinyl compounds or their derivatives which are represented by the following Formula, instead of the above given halogenated allyl compounds or their derivatives.EMI20.1 where R, R and R are similar to those described before.X indicates the halogens such as Br, I, Cl and etc. In this case, against the alpha position vinylic position of the halogenated vinyl compounds or their derivatives, Rf will be introduced selectively as follows under the conditions of dehalogenation X .

In this case, with the carbon atoms which are bonded with the halogen, the cross coupling is generated.EMI24.1 where X indicates halogens such as Br, I and C1 Y indicates at least one type of the substituent or hydrogen atom,which is selected from the groups consisting of alkyl group or alkenyl group having carbon atom numbers of 5 or less, or cyano group, nitro group, ester group and aryl group. Here, as Y, the alkyl group or alkenyl group such as methyl group and ethyl group can be applied, but it is preferable to limit the number of the carbon atoms to 5 or less. Also, the above given substituent Y may be introduced with the number of 1 to 3 or at one to three locations against the benzene nucleus. The Ullmann type reaction is known as a method to introduce the perfluoroalkyl group into those halogenated aromatic compounds, but the handling is extremely difficult due to difficulty in the preparation of copper powder to be used, and that the reaction is significantly affected in proportion to the amount of the copper power used. Conversely, the method of the present invention is very easy in handling, and can introduce Rf into the aromatic compounds with a higher yield. As the palladium type catalyst, when PdCl2 orPd PPh3 2Cl2 is employed, it is ascertained that a sufficient catalytic function is presented.When the palladium black was employed instead of PdCl21 and the benzene iodide and the heptafluoro Q methyl ethyl zinc iodide let reacted with the heptafluoro methyl. ethyl benzene was obtained with a yield by 53 .This fact suggests that Pd O which is thought to be generated from PdC12 or Pd PPh3 2Cl2 at the action of ultrasonic waves under the presence of Zn powder is acting as a catalyst actually. It is considered that thisPd 0 forms the following reduction oxidation cycle, and following this cycle, Rf is effectively introduced into the benzene nucleus.EMI25.1 tb R SEP I SEP SEP Ari SEP Ultrasonic SEP waves, SEP Zn Tetrahydrofuran tb SEP f SEP SEP Ar tb SEP Pd PPh3 2Cl2 tb EMI26.1 Various reactions were caused on the above given halogenated aromatic compounds or their derivatives following the method of the present invention, and obtained the results of which the Table 3 below shows.

With this method, it is preferable to let an amount of zinc powder to be added in the course of reaction being limited within a range of 1 to 3 times molar ratio that of RfI. As the initiating substances to be used are stabilized respectively, and the reaction can be caused within a single reactor under the condition of the ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, the method is most practicable because of an easier handling. It is, enough to use ultrasonic waves obtainable from a commerciably available ultrasonic wave cleaner in order to let act under the presence of zinc powder and palladium system catalyst. Thus the handling is made easier. Where solvents are used for the reaction according to the method of this invention, it is preferable to employ aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, tetrahydro furan, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoamide, acetonitrile and so on. As these polar catalysts possess a greater solvation energy against cation, they present a stronger dissolving action, and accelerate the reaction rate of anionic reagents. Further, according to the method of the present invention, where the initiating substance itself is of liquid, it is not always necessary to use the above described solvents. The present inventor has found out that, apart from the above stated synthetic reaction, the desired fluorine containing aliphatic unsaturated compound or fluorine containing aromatic compounds can be synthesized with the following reaction in a stabilized fashion and with a good yield. That is, as an initiating substance, a fluorinecontaining aliphatic zinc iodide represented by the following formula instead of the above given RfI is employed. Rf ZnI where Rf is similar to the above given one This Rf ZnI is let reacted under the ultrasonic wave action and under the presence of a halogen substituted aliphatic unsaturated compound or a halogen substituted aromatic compound and a palladium type catalyst. Thereby, the above mentioned Rf is introduced into the above said multiple bond or benzene nucleus, and it is possible to obtain an aliphatic unsaturated compound or aromatic compound which is eliminated of the above stated halogen. This reaction is characterized by the employment of the RfZnI itself which is considered to be an intermediate product at the respective reaction described as above as an initiating substance.This is represented, for instance, as follows.EMI29.1 EMI29.2 tb palladium SEP type SEP catalyst tb SEP r tb Ultrasonic SEP wave tb EMI29.3 Thence, the product similar to that of the above, for instance, a fluorine containing allyl compound derivative 3 can be obtained. The reaction conditions for palladium system catalysts, ultrasonic waves, solvents and etc. may be similar to that of above described one. According to this reaction, it is characteristic to use the pre synthesized RFZnI. Even in this case, it is thought that, similar to the above description, the action of ultrasonic waves causes a closer interaction between the reacting molecules, and with the catalystic action of a palladium type catalyst, the generation of a desired product may be accelerated. That is, it is presumed that, particularly the bonding of Rf Zn of Rf ZnI is made weaker due to the ultrasonic wave energy, and also the interaction with the reacting substance is increased, and the reaction betweeri both of them may proceed to the full extent. The RFZnI itself well dissolves into the solvent, thereby the reaction proceeds in a ready manner. Also, the RfZnI can be synthesized by causing the above saidRfI and Zn powder to react each other within an autoclave, for instance, at a temperature range, 120 to 1500C. In this case, it is advisable to use an amount of Zn at one to three times the number of mols that of RfI. The above described fluorine containing compounds which are synthesized by means of the method of the present invention are useful as the synthetic intermediates for water or oil repellent agents, medicines and agricultural chemicals, and surface active agents, or the monomers to produce fluorine containing polymers. With the method of the present invention, fluorinecontaining allyl derivatives represented by the following formula can be obtained.Formula EMI31.1 where Rf indicates the fluorine containing aliphatic group preferably with the number of carbon atoms of 10 or less R, R and R indicate the hydrogen atom, the alkyl group or alkenyl group preferably having carbon atoms of 10 or less, or aromatic group, or aromatic group substituted by the substituent. As the Rf of this fluorine containing allyl derivatives represented by the above Formula, the fluorinecontaining aliphatic groups represented by the Formula CF3 CF2 n or CF3 2CF CF2 n can be mentioned.Included are CF3 , CF3CF2 , CF3 CF2 2 , CF3 CF2 3 , CF3 CF2 4 CF3 CF2 5 , CF3 2CF , CF3 2CFCF2 , CF3 2CF CF2 2 , CF3 2CF CF2 2 t and so on. Apart from these alkyl groups, it is possible to use the unsaturated group, particularly the alkenyl group, for instance, CF2 CF CF2 , CF3 CF CF , and the like.However, it is preferable to limit the number of carbon atoms of the fluorine containing aliphatic group to be used to 10 or less taking into account the solubility against solvents. And, as the above described fluorinecontaining aliphatic group, it is possible to use not only the above enumerated perfluoroalkyl group or alkenyl group, but also, for instance, CF3 CF2 2CH2CF2 which is bonded with the hydrogen atoms at a part of the molecular chain.In addition, as the above given Rf, other than the above, the aromatic group substituted aliphatic groups, for instance, C6H5 CF2 , C6H5 CF2 2 and the like may be used. Also, as the above given R, R and R , apart from the hydrogen atoms, the alkyl groups such as methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group or alkenyl groups containingpartially unsaturated bond may be applied, but it is preferable to limit the number of carbon atoms to 10 or less. And, where the aromatic group substituted with the substituent is applied, it is necessary to use the substituent which will not substantially affect the proceeding of dehalogenating reaction.As those substituents, the alkyl group or alkenyl group may be used, but it is advisable to limit the number of the carbon atoms to 5 or less. Also, as the other substituents, other than the abovedescribed alkyl group or alkenyl group, the aryl gorup, halogens like Cl, nitro group, cyano group and alkoxy group containing 5 or less number of the carbon atoms may be counted. Further, the present invention proposes another method, in producing the desired fluoroketone groups, which is characterized with a process to generate the metallic halogenated ketone represented by the Formula EMI33.1 where R represents the aliphatic hydrocarbon oxy group, aliphatic hydrocarbon group or fluoro aliphatic hydrocarbon, and includes those forming rings between the carbon atoms being bonded with X X halogen Y. hydrogen or fluorine atom M zinc or magnesium , with the metal M consisting of zinc or magnesium, by causing the reaction with the halogenated ketone which is represented by the Formula EMI33.2 where R, X and Y are similar to the above given description and with a process to generate the fluorodiketone which is represented by the Formula EMI34.1 where R and Y are similar to the previous description, and Rf is fluoro aliphatic hydrocarbon group and includes those containing ether bonds within the chain. by causing the abovegiven metallic halogenated ketone to react with the fluoroester which is represented by the Formula RfCOOR where Rf is asdescribed above, and R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group or aromatic hydrocarbon group. under the action of ultrasonic waves. That is, this method took advantage of the strong, electrophilic property of Rf under the presence of fluorine in particular within the structure of the above given fluoroester, and by making the interaction between the fluoroester and the above given metal halogenated ketone by means of the energy of ultrasonic waves it is enough to use a commercially available ultrasonic cleaner , a full and easier reaction between both of them were attained.Thereby, it became possible to fluorinate the objects with the use of various fluoroesters, and the production of them became able to be processed with a higher yield under the milder conditions. In addition, it was found out that the reaction could proceed satisfactorily by using the commercially available zinc and magnesium without refining them, contrary to the case of the conventional Reformatsky reaction. The method of the present invention can cause the above given halogenated ketone to react with the fluoroester subjecting them to the action of ultrasonic waves under the presence of zinc or magnesium. It is therefore possible to obtain the desired compound by putting all the reacting reagents into a reactor from the start with the action of the ultrasonic waves. Conversely, it also is able to obtain the desired product, firstly by generating the above said metal halogenated ketone with the reaction of the above described ketone with zinc or magnesium under the action of ultrasonic waves, then by letting that ketone to react with the above fluoroester under the action of ultrasonic waves.In this case, the generation of the abovedescribed metallic halogenated ketone will not always require the action of ultrasonic waves, and it is possible to obtain the metallic halogenated ketone by causing the reaction of the halogenated ketone with zinc or magnesium under heating. At the method of the present invention, it is preferable to let the above stated redaction proceed within the aprotic polar solvents so as to accelerate a reaction rate. As the polar solvent, it is possible to use the tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrolidone, hexamethylphosphoamide or mixtures of two or more of the above substances. Secondly, for the reaction reagents to be used for the method of the present invention, it is possible to apply the aliphatic hydrocarbon oxy group alkoxy group such as OCH3, OC2H5, OC3H7, OC4H9 , aliphatic hydrocarbon group alkyl group such as CH3,, C2H5, C3H7, C4Hg or alkenyl group with the number of the carbon atom similar to the former , or fluoro aliphatic hydrocarbon group fluoroalkyl group such as CF3, C2F2, C3F7, C4Fg or fluoroalkenyl group with the number of carbon atom similar to the above , all of which R is to be with the number of carbon atom at 10 or less.In addition, it is sufficient that this R may be the one which forms rings between the carbon atoms which are bonded with the above described Y, as in the case of d 3 halogenated camphor. Also, it is preferable that X contained in the halogenated ketone is to be of the bromine atom or iodine atom. Further, at the above described fluoroester, Rf which becomes the source to introduce fluorine into the subject compound may consist of fluoroalkyl group or alkenyl group which contains the carbon atoms in the number of 15 or less. Included are fluoroalkyl group such as CF3, C2F21 C,F7 C4F9 or C5Fll, or fluoroalkenyl containing the similar number of the carbon atoms, also included are those fluoroalkenyl groups or alkenyl groups which are partially substituted and introduced with other halogens i.e. Cl . Also, this Rf may be the fluoroalkylether group which is represented by the following Formula, and which can form an optical isomer containing the asymmetric carbon, and forms a shift reagent being superior in NMR analysis nuclear magnetic resonance analysis EMI37.1 where n 0cm3 C asymmetric carbon And also, the R contained in this fluoroester may consist of the above given alkyl group or alkenyl group which contains the carbon atoms in the number of 10 or less. Here, the above stated method is described in a more detailed fashion. First, the Reformatsky type reagent 9 is generated by causing the brominated ester 8Bto react with zinc powder under the action of ultrasonic waves, then by letting this reagent 9 reacted with the fluoroalkylester 10 under the action of ultrasonic waves, the desired ss fluoroalkyl ss ketocarboxylic acid ester 11 can be obtained.

In the meantime, at the above described reaction, even when magnesium instead of zinc was used to let react with RfCOOR according to the Grignard method, it was found out that the required ketocarboxylio acid ester 13 could be obtained. This fact also is considered that the reaction may proceed with a high yield due to the above given properties of Rf and the action of the ultrasonic wave energy. Also, at the above reaction, it is possible to use, for the halogenated ketone 8 to produce the reagent 9 , the substance represented by the Formula EMI39.1 can be used.This halogenated ketone may be the one which introduces fluorine into the object. In this case, it is enough to substitute R with the fluoroalkyl group Rf .However, when the bond between R C of ketone is split andR is eliminated in the course of the reaction, and if fluorine F is adopted for the above described Y, even when R is not present in the object, fluorine as Y can be introduced, and the physiological activity can be maintained. Further, as this halogenated ketone, when the brominated acetone BrCHYCOCH3 of which R consists of the alkyl group is used instead of the above described brominated ester 8 , the product 11 can be obtained with a good yield. When the brominated fluoroacetoneEMI40.1 which substitutes this R with the fluoroalkyl gorup Rf is used, and this substance is let reacted with the fluoroesterEMI40.2 according to the following reaction Formula, a superior shift reagent 12 can be obtained. CF3COCH2Br ZnEMI40.3 tb Ultrasonic SEP wave tb Solvent SEP BrZnCH2COCF3 tb EMI40.4 Ultrasonic waveEMI40.5 EMI40.6 As this shift reagent has the ether bond which is bonded with the oxygen atoms between the asymmetric carbon and perfluoropropyl group CF2CF2CF3 , the bond is stabilized by oxygen, and even when the nucleophilic reagent may act,EMI40.7 will not be eliminated. Also, it is possible to select various Rf s as above, particularly as the Rf of the above described fluoroester RfCOOR , the above statedEMI41.1 where n 0 3 may be applied. Then, description is made on an example which introduced the RfCO group into d camphor as a shift reagent for NMR. According to the similar process described as above, d 3 bromcamphor 13 was let reacted with perfluoroalkylester RfCOOR 10 being irradiated with the ultrasonic waves according to the following Formula under the presence of zinc powder, and obtained the desired shift reagent 14 with ease and a high yield.EMI41.2 EMI41.3 tb Zn, SEP Ultrasonic SEP wave tb Tetrahydrofuran dimethylformamide 2 1 13 RfCOOR EMI41.4 Ultrasonic waveEMI41.5 This d camphor derivative 14 is excellent as a shift reagent, and was obtained with a high yield as shown in the following Table.

The fluoro diketone which can be obtained by the method of this invention are characterized being represented by the following Formula EMI43.1 where R represents a fluorohydrocarbon group, and fluorohydrocarbon group or hydrocarbon group which have ether bonds in their chain such asEMI43.2 including those forming rings between the carbon atoms which are bonded with Y, Y is hydrogen atom or fluorine atom, Rf represents a fluorohydro carbon group, and includes those haying ether bonds in their chains i.e. the ether bond similar to that of the above given R. The compounds among these fluoro diketones in which the asymmetric carbon C is present are effective to form achiral shift reagent such as europium chelates. That is, due to the fluorine atoms, 1 the electrophilic property is strengthened, and the chelate is activated, resulting in the increase of the Iewisacidity as the shift reagent, thereby an excellent shift effect is obtained even at a lower concentration.2 As the lesser presence of the hydrogen atoms which overlap the substrate, the overlapping with the signal of the substrate becomes decreased.3 The solubility against the organic solvents is increased.4 when the R in the above given Formula isEMI44.1 as it becomes a symmetric structure from the viewpoint of the molecular structure, the shift reagent is stabilized due to the steric effect, and it is made possible to have two asymmetric centers carbon . In addition, these fluoro diketone groups are expected to present the above described action as the fluorine compounds due to the presence of fluorine. Further, structurally, when R and or Rf in the above Formula is of a fluoroalkyl group which is represented by the Formula EMI44.2 where n C 3 the ether bond, due to 0 between fluoroalkyl groups, contributes to stabilize that structure. That is, when there is no such ether bond, and the fluoroalkyl group is directly bonded to the above givenEMI45.1 andEMI45.2 the Rf acts as a pseudo halogen, and is eliminated easily due to the 0II action of the nucleophilic reagent onto C, but because of the above stated ether bond, such chemical change is prevented, and enables to maintain the fluoroalkyl group within the molecule in a stabilized fashion. At the above Formula, the R may be of a fluoroalkyl group or alkyl group comprising the carbon atoms with the number of 7 or less, such as CF3, C3F7, C4Fg, or CH3, C2Hg, C3H7, C4Hg respectively. And also this R may be of those forming the rings between the carbon atoms which are bonded with the above given Y as in the case of d camphor. These fluoro corpora of d camphor also are useful as a shift reagent for NMR. Here, the above described fluoro diketones are exemplified in a concrete manner according to the production processes which are different from the method of the present invention. The perfluoro carbonic acid, for instance, perfluoro 2 propoxypropionic acid fluorideEMI45.3 is obtained by means of the dimerization reaction of hexafluoro l, 2 epoxypropane.This perfluoro carbonic acid fluoride 15 generates a diastereamer mixture by condensing together with mi phenylethylamine 16 according to the following Formula.Thence, the product which is obtained by separating the above said mixture by means of column gas chromatography is hydrolyzed, and optically resolved to optically active perfluoro carboxylic acid 151 EMI46.1 EMI46.2 tb Separation SEP Hydrolysis SEP lit SEP tb SEP tb Further, at this perfluoro carbo rylic acid 15 , when a perfluoroisopropyl group is applied as the above described Rf, it is known htat the 15 can be optically resolved in an extremely effective fashion from the mixture 16 . Among them, it is advisable to obtain perfluoro 2 isopropoxypropionic acid through fluoride 17 which is synthesized according to the following Formula. EMI47.1 EMI47.2 DiglymeEMI47.3 EMI47.4 Separation HydrolysisEMI47.5 EMI47.6 On the other hand, the enolate anion 19 which is obtained from the tert butyl acetate 18 in accordance with the following Formula is known to be a useful reagent to obtain the corresponding p diketone from carboxylic acid chloride.EMI47.7 Thence, perfluoro 2 propoxypropionic acid 15 , for instance, among the above given perfluoro carboxylic acid which was optically resolved, was led to its acid chloride EMI48.1 20 with phosphorus pentachloride, which was caused to react with the following Formula thereby the desired chiral ss diketonedi perfluoro 2 propoxypropionyl methane 21 was synthesized. It is possible to obtain this diketone 21 with a good yield i.e. 90 .EMI48.2 P toluenesulfonic acidEMI48.3 EMI48.4 ss diketone di perfluoro 2 propoxypropionyl methane 21 thus obtained was further led to the undergiven corresponding europium chelate 22 in accordance with the established method.EMI49.1 The following Table 6 shows the results examined on 1H NMR of several substrates by adding this europium chelate 22 .

This fact means that the shift reagent which uses fluoro y3 diketone is suffice to be of a concentration less than the public known only by 1 4 to 1 6, and fully indicates a superiority of this invention. Also, as the above given shift reagent 22 contained no hydrogen atoms which will overlap the substrate, it was found out that a very neat H NMR spectrum could be obtained. In addition, this shift reagent can dissolve into nonpolar organic solvents like carbon tetrachloride, specifically, it dissolves unlimitedly into the fluorinesystem solvent such as 1, 1, 2 trichlorotrifluoroethane, and can be maintained in a stabilized fashion within the given solution. Thus, where the NMR analysis is conducted, the above described shift reagent can be added in the form of 1, 1, 2 trichloro trifluoroethane solution by means of a microsyringe and the like. Further, the above described europium chelate 22 has not only the above mentioned conspicuous advantages, but also a pair of perfluoroproxyethyl groupsEMI51.1 which have asymmetric carbon atoms respectively are positioned symmetrically. Thereby, due to its steric effect, the molecular structure is kept stabilized, and also as it has two asymmetric centers, it presents a superior shift effect. This europium chelate generally acts to shift the spectrum toward the lower magnetic field side as a shift reagent during the NMR analysis.Contrary to that intrinsic characteristic, it is possible to form praseodymium chelate which places Pr praseodymium as the central atom of chelate instead of the above givenEu so as to shift the spectrum toward the higher magnetic field side. In addition, the above described substance 21 can be obtained with a good yield by means of the method of the present invention. Also, the abovegiven shift reagent 14 forms the chiral reagent as shown by the following Formula EMI52.1 Further, here are given more detailed description on the examples which were experimented for the present invention. The under described examples, however, will not set limits to the present invention, and that they may be deformed being based on its technical concept. Example 1 Commercially available zinc powder 0.02 gr atom , trifluoromethyl iodide 2.15 gr 11 mmol , benzaldehyde 1.06 gr 10 mmol , and dimethylformamide 25 ml which is dried by means of a molecular sieve, were put into an eggplant formed flask capacity 50 ml , and they were caused to react for 30 minutes within a water bath under the action of ultrasonic waves by means of a commercially available ultrasonic cleaner 35W, 32khz .
