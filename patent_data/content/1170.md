## Description
An improved rearing unit This invention relates to a rearing unit for farm animals and more particularly, but not exclusively, to rearing units for animals such as calves. It has been found under normal farm conditions to be difficult to rear baby calves without incurring unacceptable losses of the animals. Such losses of the animals occur due to a variety of reasons but it has been found that one major cause is due to the animals contracting pneumonia. The object of this invention is to provide a unit in which animals such as calves can be reared without incurring unacceptably high losses of the animals. According to one aspect of this invention, a rearing unit for farm animals comprises a substantially closed body having one or more cages mounted therein, the or each of which is adapted to have an animal disposed therein and constrained so that the orientation of the animal is substantially fixed relatively to the associated cage air inlet means for allowing air to enter the body and air extraction means for withdrawing air from the body characterised in that the air inlet means, the air extraction means, and the or each cage are disposed so that the flow of air through the unit is substantially directed along the length of the or each animal from the nose to the tail thereof. It has been found that animals such as baby calves are relatively sensitive to the direction of air flow past and around the animal, and if this air flow is directed from the nose to the tail of the animal, the animal is less likely to contract an infection such as pneumonianthan if the direction of air flow is uncontrolled. Preferably, the rearing unit comprises a substantially rectangular body and a row of cages is provided along each side wall of the unit with the longitudinal axis of each cage extending transversely of the unit so that the animals disposed in the cages can be arranged to face towards the longitudinal centre line of the unit. Preferably, also, the air inlet means is disposed on the longitudinal centre line of the body, and the air extraction means comprises air outlet apertures located adjacent to the side walls of the body. According to another aspect of this invention, a rearing unit for farm animals comprises a substantially closed rectangular body having one or more cages mounted therein, the or each of which is adapted to have one or more animals disposed therein characterised in that air inlet means is disposed on the longitudinal centre line of the body of the unit and air extraction means comprising outlet apertures are located adjacent to the side walls of the body so that the flow of air through the unit is directed from the centre of the body towards the sides thereof, In a rearing unit according to both aspects of this invention, the air inlet means, preferably, comprises one or more air inlets formed in the roof of the body, the or each air inlet may be provided with valve means to enable the flow of air therethrough to be adjusted.Preferably, the or each air inlet is provided with heating means for heating the air flowing into the unit and the or each air inlet may be provided with air filtration and diffusion means for filtering and diffusing the air flowing therethrough. Preferably, also, the external end of the or each air inlet is provided with a cowling to restrict or prevent the reverse flow of air therethrough. The or each air outlet aperture is, preferably, formed in the floor of the unit adjacent to the side walls thereof. Preferably, a trough is mounted on the floor of the unit at each side thereof and extends parallel to the side walls of the unit beneath the or each row of cages, and the side of each trough adjacent to the sides of the body of the unit is, preferably, raised and provided with an inclined upper surface in which air outlet openings are formed at spaced apart intervals therealong. Preferably, also, the raised side portion of each trough forms an air outlet passage providing communication between the air outlet openings in the upper surface of the raised side of the trough and the air outlet apertures in the floor of the unit.Preferably, the air extraction means also comprises one or more air extraction fans which are connected to the or each outlet aperture by ducting formed beneath the floor of the body of the unit so that air is withdrawn through the or each air outlet opening and air outlet aperture from the body of the unit. Preferably, also, the air extraction fan or fans is or are disposed beneath the floor of the unit so that the air extracted thereby is expelled beneath the unit, and two fans may be provided each of which are disposed on the longitudinal centre line of the unit. Preferably, control means is provided for controlling the speed of the or each air extraction fan, and the operation of the heating means in the or each air inlet to maintain a desired volume of air flow through the unit and also control the temperature and the humidity of the air in the unit. Preferably, also, the or each cage or series of cages are provided with removable partitions so that the sie of the cages can be varied according to the number and or size of the animals which are to be disposed therein. A feeding and drinking unit may also be provided at the end of the or each cage adjacent to the longitudinal centre line of the body of the unit. A preferred embodiment of this invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a plan view of a rearing unit Figure 2 is a side elevation of the rearing unit Figure 3 is a sectional side elevation on the line Ill Ill in Figure 1 of the drawings Figure 4 is a sectional plan view on the line IV IV in Figure 2 of the drawings Figure 5 is a sectional plan view on the line V V inFigure 2 of the drawings Figure 6 is a sectional end elevation on the linesVI VI in Figure 2 of the drawings and Figure 7 is a sectional side elevation of an alternative cowling. Referring now to the drawings, a rearing unit for farm animals such as baby calves comprises a substantially closed rectangular wooden body indicated generally at 10 which is mounted on two spaced apart longitudinally extending skid members 12. The unit is capable of being moved slidably on the skid members 12 to enable it to be located in a required position on, for example, a concrete base not shown . The body 10 comprises a rectangular wooden floor 14 having two wooden end walls, 16, 18 and two wooden side walls 20, 22 extending upwardly from the edges of the floor 14, and a wooden roof 24 extending between the upper edges of the end walls 16, 18 and the side walls 20, 22. Two rows of cages 26 are mounted in the body 10 and extend along each side wall 20, 22 over substantially the entire length thereof. The cages 26 are provided with removable partitions or divisions 28 so that the cages 26 can be arranged to consist of individual units whilst enabling the size of each cage unit to be varied to accommodate different sizes and or numbers of calves as they develop and grow. Each individual cage unit is arranged so that during the early stages of development of the calves when only one calf is placed in each cage unit, the longitudinal axis of each cage unit extends transversely of the body 10 and the calf is constrained so that the head of the calf faces towards the centre line of the body 10 of the rearing unit. The cages 26 can be formed of any suitable material and are provided with a slatted floor through which animal excrement can pass.A continuous bucket type of feeding unit 30 is mounted at the end of each cage unit adjacent to the centre line of the body 10 and two alternative mounting positions for the feeding unit 30 are provided so that the calf can either feed from a teat not shown mounted on the bucket or direct from the bucket itself. A central walkway 32 is provided between the rows of cages 28 and access thereto from the exterior of the body 10 is provided by doors 34 formed in each end wall 16, 18. Five spaced apart air inlets 36 are. formed in the roof 24 on the centre line thereof and each air inlet 36 is provided with a cowling 38 to restrict or prevent the creation of draughts in the body 10 of the rearing unit.An alternative type of cowling which could be mounted on each air inlet 36 is indicated generally at 38 a in Figure 7 of the drawings. An electrical heating element 40 and an air filter and diffuser 42 formed of an open cell foam plastics material are mounted in each air inlet 36. A valve 44 is also disposed in each air inlet 36 to enable the flow of air through each air inlet 36 to be adjusted.The valves 44 can be arranged to be manually operable or, alternstively, the valves 44 can be power operated, for example electrically, so that the flow of air into the body 10 of the rearing unit can be controlled by a separate control means not shown . Filtered and, if desired, heated air thus enters the body 10 of the rearing unit through the air inlets 36 at spaced apart points on the centre line of the roof 24, and the volume of air entering the body 10 of the unit can be controlled and adjusted by means of the valves 44. A trough 46 formed of a glass reinforced plastics material is mounted on the floor 24 of the unit at each side thereof and each trough 46 extends along the full length of the unit. Each trough 46 is disposed beneath an associated one of the rows of cages 26 and is adapted to collect the animal excrement falling through the slatted floor of the cages 26 enabling this excrement to be easily removed periodically from the rearing unit.The side of each trough 46 adjacent to the associated side 20, 22 of the body 10 of the unit is raised and is provided with an inclined upper surface 48 in which air outlet openings 50 are formed at spaced apart intervals therealong. The raised side portion of each trough 46 forms an air outlet passage 52 which provides communication between air outlet apertures 54 formed in the floor 14 and the air outlet openings 50 formed in the inclined surface 48 of the trough 46. The air outlet apertures 54 are disposed at spaced apart intervals along each side of the body 10 of the unit and are each connected by ducting 56 disposed beneath the floor 14 to one of the two electrically operated fans 58 mounted beneath the floor 14 on the centre line of the body 10.Consequently, the fans 58 are mounted directly beneath the central walkway 32 and access can be provided to the fans 58 through removable covers 60 in the central walkway 32 of the floor 14 to facilitate, for example, servicing of the fans at periodic intervals. The fans 58 draw air from the body 10 of the unit through the air outlet openings 50, the air outlet passages 52, the air outlet apertures 54 and the ducting 56 and this air is expelled by the fans beneath the rearing unit through openings 62. The withdrawal of air from the body 10 of the rearing unit by the fans 58 causes air to flow into the unit through the air inlets 36 in the roof 24. The air flowing into the unit through the air inlets 36 is filtered and the direction of flow thereof is diffused by the air filters and diffusers 42 so that a uni directional blast of air is not created. The air flow in the unit itself is directed from the centre line of the body 10 of the unit past the animals in the cages 26 towards the sides of the unit and thus flows past the caged animals from the nose to the tail thereof. The control means not shown is adapted to control the speed of the fans 58 in addition to controlling the operation of the heating elements 40 and, if desired, the operation of the valves 44 in the air inlets 36. The control means not shown is provided with a facility whereby a minimum rate of flow of air can be selected by setting each of the fans 58 to rotate at least at a minimum speed. This, of course, provides control of the minimum rate of air flow in the unit and also facilitates the accurate control of the temperature of the air in the body 10 of the unit.The temperature of the air in the unit is sensed by a temperature sensing device not shown such as a thermister and when the temperature of the air in the unit rises above a predetermined desired value, the control means increases the speed of the fans 58 to increase the air flow through the unit and simultaneously switches off the heating elements 40. This type of control arrangement facilitates the accurate control of the temperature of the air in the unit without creating sudden surges of air flow within the unit. Additional background heating within the unit can be provided by gas fired heaters 64 mounted at spacedapart intervals on the roof 24 of the unit and this background heating, if desired, is controlled by an independent thermostat not shown mounted on one wall of the body 10 of the unit. It will therefore be apparent that the above described rearing unit thus provides a carefully controlled environment for the baby calves which greatly assists the rearing of the calves and assists in minimising losses due to infections, such as pneumonia.
