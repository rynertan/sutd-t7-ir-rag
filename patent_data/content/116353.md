# A method for controlling air fuel ratio and air fuel ratio detector.

## Abstract
A sensor for detecting an air fuel ratio is fitted to an exhaust pipe of an internal combustion engine so as to effect feedback control and to keep the air fuel ratio of the engine at a predetermined value. To improve the feedback control accuracy, the sensor response must be increased. If the response is increased too much, however, the sensor output is found deviated from the true air fuel ratio, and the deviation quantity is also found proportional to the change of the air fuel ratio with respect to time. The invention makes it possible to make appropriate air fuel ratio control by com pensating for the output signal of the sensor using the signal component based upon the change of the air fuel ratio with time, among the sensor output signals.
