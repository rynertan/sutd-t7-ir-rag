# Curable composition.

## Abstract
A moisture curable composition comprising an arcylate or methacrylate polymer having a silicon functional group capable of causing crosslinking or chain extension by mois ture, at least in molecular ends, and being useful particularly as a sealing material and a pressure sensitive adhesive, said polymer being prepared by polymerizing a an alkyl acrylate or methacrylate or a monomer mixture of at least 50 by weight of the alkyl acrylate or methacrylate and other unsatu rated compounds copolymerizable therewith and b 0 to 20 parts of α,β ethylenically unsaturated organic silicon com pound in the presence of c 0.01 to 20 parts of a radical polymerization initiator having a group of the general for mula
