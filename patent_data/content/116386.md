# Time division switching system.

## Abstract
Time division switching system to which incoming and outgoing transmission channels C1H, C5H , which are designed for the transmission of bit streams subdivided into bits, are connected, The switching system which is integ rable, that is to say that a small number of chips, an acceptable number of connection pins and a small number of chip types are sufficient. Such a switching system is constructed so that it has a number N of time division switching stages T , a number N of distribution DIST and a number N of collectors COLL , that each distributor has N inputs H1W to which an incoming transmission channel is connected, that each collector has N outputs H4W to each of which is connected an outgoing transmission channel, that each distributor has N outputs C2H , each of the N outputs of a distributor being connected to an input of each of the time division switching stages T for a proportionate distribution according to a predetermined pattern of the bit stream of each incoming transmission channel over the N time division switching stages, and that each collector has N inputs C4H , each of the N inputs of a collector being connected to an output of each of the time division switching stages for collecting according to a predetermined pattern the bit streams for each outgoing transmission channel. Such a switching system is particularly suitable for use on board of a satellite.
