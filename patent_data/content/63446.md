# Apparatus for directing a lubricating liquid under pressure to a moving chain.

## Abstract
A chain spraying or lubricating apparatus 10 to engage a chain 16 of a trolley conveyor 12 . A support plate 22 secured to the support beam 14 of the conveyor has a sprocket assembly 30 suspended from it. This comprises a generally circular disc 32 with a plurality of teeth 34 supported thereon which are dimensioned to be engaged by the chain. A liquid supply tank 36 is secured to the disc and spray nozzles 130 are positioned within the teeth 34 and supplied with liquid from the supply tank 36 by pump means 110 . As the chain 16 moves, the teeth 34 engaged in the chain move causing the disc 32 to rotate. The pump means 110 is preferably a plunger 150 in an elongated chamber 119 operated by cam means 218 in response to rotation of the disc 220 to avoid excess spraying. An agitator 302 within the supply tank 36 and a pop up flag 254 to indicate when the liquid level in the supply tank 36 is low can conveniently be fitted. Such a device is compact, essentially self contained and requires no external source of power for operation.
