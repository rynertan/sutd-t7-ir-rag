## Description
The present invention relates to a small size motor. More particularly, it relates to a small size motor which is filled with an atmosphere containing an organic compound vapor so as to prolong its duration of life. A small size motor of a type comprising brushes and commutator elements slidably engaged with the brushes is, for example, used for driving a recording tape of a tape recorder, video tape recorder and the like. In case of a small size motor in which make and break of contact most frequently occur, two kinds of brushes are typically used. One of them comprises a sheet or a wire rod of an electrically conductive resilient material e.g., copper, beryllium copper alloy, copper titanium alloy, phosphor bronze and nickel silver which is cladded with or partially spot welded by a noble metal or its alloy e.g., gold, palladium, platinum, silver and copper or their alloys . The other comprises the above sheet or wire rod a part of which is provided with a brush element made of sintered carbon e.g., carbon, Ag carbon, Cu carbon, AgCu carbon, which optionally contain an additive such as SiC, MoS₂, Pb and an epoxy resin by means of an electrically conductive adhesive, spot welding or calking. The conventional small size motor has several drawbacks such that when the commutator rotates with sliding on the brushes, sliding parts of the brushes unavoidably vibrate to an unacceptable extent, which results in abnormal welding of contact surfaces of the sliding parts of the brushes contacting with the commutator segments, and that spark often generates a black material, which is a mixture of carbon and worn powder formed between the brushes and the commutator segment and induces and worsens abnormal pheno mena. In one type of the small size motor, the sliding part of the brush, which is slidably engaged with the commutator segment, is integrally molded with a brush base supported by a supporting member provided on, for example, a cover of a motor case. A contacting state between the brushes and the commutator segments of such the motor is shown in Fig.1. In Fig. 1, bent sliding parts 3,3 of brushes are mounted on respective brush bases 2,2 supported by respec tive brush supporting means 1,1. The brush bases and the sliding parts of the brushes are inherently resilient so that they are pressed against and in contact with commutator segments 4. The pressure to be exerted by the brushes are adjusted by selecting the angle between the brush base 2 and the sliding part of the brush 3. The commutator segment 4 is fixed on a revolving shaft 6 of the motor via a commutator base 5 and rotates in accordance with the rotation of the motor shaft. During commutation and on make and break of the contact, spark is generated between the commutator segment 4 and the sliding part of the brush 3 and undesirably causes electric noise, and abrasion or welding of the commutator segment 4 and or the sliding part of the brush 3. For instance, when the welding occurs at a part A of the brush where the contact with the commutator begins and ends, the welded material scratches and damages the surface of the commutator segment 4, and the thus abrased chips are trapped in gap B between the adjacent commutator segments to form of circuits between them. This results in unstable rotation of the motor. The rough surface of the commutator segment induces vibration of the brushes, enhan ces the spark generation and or causes abnormal abrasion of the brushes, and further induces noise and or dislocation of the commutation point. These result in the deterioration of the performance of the motor. The spark is most frequently generated at the part A of the sliding part of the brush 3 with which the commu tator segment 4 contacts. Needless to say, the mechanical abrasion due to other causes than the spark is generated on the commutator segment 4 and the sliding part of the brush 3. The sliding part of the brush is commonly made of the noble metal alloys or the sintered carbon as described in the above, while the commutator segment is made of the noble metal alloy e.g., AgCu, AgCd, AgCuCd, AgCuTi, etc. . In case of the noble metal brush, the sliding part of the brush and the commutator segment are made of subs tantially the same material having high surface energy as follows calculated from the sublimation heats at 20 C. cf. Chem. Rev., Fig. 2A shows a brush not having a mechanical means for preventing spark, namely means for damping vib ration. Since the sliding part of such brush vibrates with a large amplitude, it frequently induces spark and consequently abrasion and welding of the commutator segment. Fig. 2B shows a brush having means for damping vibration comprising a rubber vibration insulator 8 adhered on the sliding part of the brush 3 with an adhesive 9. Although the rubber vibration insulator absorbs vibration and prevents generation of the spark at a room temperature, adhesivity of the adhesive is deteriorated at a temperature around 60 C so that bonding between the insulator 9 and the sliding part 3 is weakened. As the result, the vibration insulating property is degraded and therefore spark is vigorously generated. This means that a motor comprising such brush does not have a long duration of life. Fig. 2C also shows a brush having another means for damping vibration comprising a vibration insulating sheet 12 adhered on the sliding part of the brush 3 with an adhesive sheet 11 comprising a substrate 10 both surfaces of which are coated with an adhesive 8. The sheet 12 prevents deterioration of the adhesivity of the adhesive at a high temperature to some extent. However, it does not satisfy requirements for a long duration of life and high quality at a high temperature. The small size motor is often used in a temperature range between 10 C and 60 C. Some literatures and experiments have been analy zed conditions under which the welding between the sliding part of the brush and the commutator segment or abnormal abrasion or circuit is caused. In such conditions, an atmosphere surrounding the sliding part of the brush contains, or the commutator segment itself adsorbs an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon e.g., styrene, toluene, etc. , which will form the black material probably a decomposed material or a carbon like polymer produced by a mechanochmical reaction or their mixture with powder abrased from the brush and the commutator segment . The amount of the black material increases when the unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon is burnt by spark between the sliding part of the brush and the commutator segment. Probably because of incomplete combustion and or its chemi cal structure, the material has dense bonding structure to form a hard carbonaceous mass. It has been found that, although a hydrocarbon other than the unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon forms a black material, the material is not hard but soft and does not induce the above described abnormal conditions of the motor. According to Examples described below, following results were obtained One object of the present invention is to provide a small size motor in which slidability between the brushes and the commutator segment is improved so that wear and welding of them are decreased and thus the abrasion or mechanical loss of them is prevented, which results in a long duration of life of the motor. Another object of the invention is to provide a small size motor which improves characteristics such as wow and flutter and a duration of life of a tape recorder and the like in that the motor is installed. These and other objects are achieved by a small size motor according to the present invention of a type comprising brushes and a commutator slidably engaged with the brushes, characterized in that the interior is filled with an atmosphere containing vapor of at least one organic compound selected from the group consisting of mono or poly hydric alcohols, ethers, cyclic ethers, esters, ketones, ether alcohols, ester alcohols, aminoalcohols, carboxylic acids, amides, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, imidazoles, imidazolines and monocyclic oxyterpenes. The organic compound is impregnated in a suitable material such as felt, a synthetic or natural plastic or rubber open cell foam and installed in the motor interior. Alternatively or additonally, it can be directly applied to an element of the motor such as the brush or the sliding part of the brush for simplicity of the motor construction. The organic compound is vaporized at an ambient temperature so as to provide an atmosphere of its vapor in the motor interior. The evaporated compound is adsorbed by the surfaces of the brush and or the commutator segment to form a mono or poly molecular layer, so that the lubricity of the surface is improved and the abrasion of the surfaces is significantly reduced. Figs. 3 and 4 each shows one embodiment of the small size motor of the invention. In these figures, the same numerals stand for the same elements in Fig. 1, and numerals 14, 15 and 16 stand for a bracket for supporting the brushes and the like, a lower motor case and a sheet felt impregnated with the organic compound according to the present invention. An evaporation rate of the organic compound can be controlled by selecting thickness of the felt fiber and or apparent density of the felt. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the impregnated felt 16 is placed on the bracket 14 near the sliding part of the brush 3, and in Fig. 4, on the brush base 2. Alternatively, the felt 16 may be placed on the sliding part of the brush 3. The place where the organic compound impregnated material is placed or the element to which the organic compound is impregnated is not limited in so far as the place or element does not interfere or deteriorate the operation of the motor. For example, the organic compound may be blended in the plastic bracket 14 or the plastic commutator base 5, impregnated in magnet wire 19 see Fig. 5 , blended in metal oil of an upper metal 18 and or lower metal 7 see Fig. 5 , placed in a gap between a magnet 21 and a motor case 22 see Fig. 5 , blended in the insulator rubber 9 or the adhesive 8. The organic compound may be contained in a gas permeable film or case made of, for example, polyethylene and placed in the small size motor. The organic compound used according to the present invention does not form such hard black material as formed from the unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon and reduces the sliding resistance between the sliding part of the brush and the commutator segment. At a high temperature and low humidity at which the abnormal conditions often occur in the motor, the motor case is provided with an atmosphere containing the organic compound. Since the organic material used according to the present invention has at least one polar group and is strongly adsorbed on a metal surface by van der Waals binding, its absorption on the metal surface is stable. The organic compound has preferably a boiling or sublimation point of 40 to 350 C, particularly 100 to 300 C under atmospheric pressure. When the boiling or sublimation point is too low, the compound is too quickly evaporated and its effect does not last long. When the boiling point is too high, it is hardly evaporated and the motor case is not quickly filled with the atmosphere containing the compound vapor.

Among these organic compounds, the poly and mono hydric alcohols and the ether alcohols are preferred. The present invention will be hereinafter explai ned further in detail by following Examples. In Examples, used was a small size DC motor of Fig. 5 having an outer diameter of 30 mm, a height of 25 mm and normal power of 0.1 W and comprising brushes made of sintered AgC and commutators made of phosphor bronze. The motor contained a sheet of polyester felt 17 which had been washed and defatted with polyfluoroethylene and impregnated with each organic compound. In each Example, following organic compound was used and the motor was operated on 4.2 V at 25 mA. The maximum period of time in which the motor was normally operated is shown in following Table 1. However, the operation was terminated at 1,500 hours. A commutating wave properly reflects the abnor mality of the motor. An abnormal wave indicates the abnormal operation of the motor such as unstable revolution, increase of demand power, failure of starting and abnormal revolution. The abnormal wave means that the noise is added on the normal wave or the abnormal part of the wave falls to the ground GND level current 0 as seen in Figs. 6 1 to 6 3. The commutating waves before and after operation are shown in Figs. 6 1 to 6 21, in which bold and thin curves represent waves before and after operation, respec tively. As understood from these waves, the motors contai ning the organic compounds used according to the present invention are stably operated after 1,500 hours while the conventional motors containing no organic compound or the unsaturated cyclic compound cannot be stably operated only after 100 or 300 hours. A motor having the same structure as that of Fig. 5, normal power of 0.04 W and comprising brushes cladded with AgPd and commutator made of a cladding material of AuAg and AdCd was operated on 12 V at 100 mA at a temperature of 10 C and RH of 20 30 . The abrased amount of the brush, wow and flutter measured according to JIS C 5551, initial no load current and initial no load noise are shown in following Table 2. According to the present invention, the organic compound is adsorbed on the surface of the brushes and the commutator segments and prevents the abrasion and welding of the sliding surfaces of them. Even if the motor interior contains the vapor of the unsaturated cyclic compound such as styrene and toluene, the sliding surfaces of the brushes and the commutator segments are protected by the organic compound used accor ding to the present invention so that the formation of the hard black material is prevented. Further, the imperfect contact between the brush and the commutator segment is prevented so that the electric noise is decreased and the motor is stably operated. This results in decrease of wow and flutter. When the small size motor with operating voltage of 1 30 V and operating current of 100 mA is operated in an atmosphere containing the vapor of the organic compound used according to the present invention, the current is decrease by 5 10 since the organic compound has a lubricating property. In addition, the organic compound adsorbed on the surface of the brushes and the commutator segments have a damping effect to prevent vibration of the brushes caused by the sliding between the brushes and the commutator segments and thus decrease the mechanical noise by 1 10 .
