# Continuous manufacturing of polymers or copolymers of trioxane.

## Abstract
The present invention starts out from the provision of a method of and an apparatus for the continuous manufactur ing of polymers or coplymers of trioxane using a continuous stirring mixing apparatus composed of two mutually parallel rotational shafts, with a large number of paddles mounted on each, and a barrel having an internal wall surface as described by the circular circumference traced during the rotation by the outer peripheries of respective pairs of paddles, the said barrel having a cross section in the shape of two circles coaxial with the two rotational shafts and said apparatus being provided with a jacket for temperature control on the outer periphery of the barrel, in which apparatus polymerization or copolymerization reactions are carried out, while stirring a mixture of trioxane, catalyst, other copolymerizable comonomers as may be the case , and additives, by rotation of the aforementioned shafts in mutually opposing directions, the mixture being continuous ly feed through the the feed supply port at one end thereof, and the fine granules of polymers or copolymers so formed being removed through the discharge port provided at the other end. From this starting point the method, as well as the apparatus, of this invention is characterized in that on the contra rotating shafts there are disposed one or more sets of paddles each having a lobed shape, with an elliptical periphery, which shape meets the requirement that the clearance beween each set of paddles, which are disposed opposite one another, one on each shaft, is always kept at less than 3 of the inner diameter of the part cylindrical barrel and wherein the set of paddles opposite each other on the two shafts are contra rotated in such manner that the clearance between the part of each paddle farthest from the rotational axis of that paddle and the inside wall surface of the barrel is always kept at less than 3 of the said barrel inner diameter.
