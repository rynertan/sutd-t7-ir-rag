# Power supply arrangement provided with a voltage converter for igniting and feeding a gas and or vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an arrangement provided with a DC Ac converter 10, 11, 13 66 to which a discharge lamp 81 is connected. The lamp is shunted by a relay 90 to obtain an electric circuit through which two electrodes 83, 84 of the lamp can be preheated. In an arrangement according to the invention, it is ensu red that the relay contact 90 is closed before a voltage occurs between the electrodes 83, 84 of the lamp 81 . Thus, it is avoided that the lamp exhibits a transient flash at too cold electrodes. A timing circuit 40 47 ensures that the contact 90 remains closed for about 1 second, after which the lamp 81 ignites at warm electrodes. No electrical losses occur in the relay 30 during operation of the lamp 81 .
