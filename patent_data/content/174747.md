## Description
The present invention relates to an exercise bicycle. FR A 2,365,890 discloses an exercise bicycle for a single user having a power display which is, however, not in the field of vision of the user when he is mounted on the exercise bicycle. DE A 2,449,440 discloses an exercise bicycle comprising a bicycle frame main body on which is mounted a seat for a user and a handle bar frame and further comprising two mutually coupled transmission systems which are coupled to a set of driving pedals and to a dynamotor arrangement for generating electric power or for providing drive. The present invention provides an exercise bicycle as disclosed in DF A 2,449,440 characterised in that two such seats, two such sets of driving pedals and two such handle bar frames are provided for respective users, said transmission systems comprise chain wheels coupled to the respective sets of driving pedals in such a manner that the sets of driving pedals can be pedalled in opposite directions to each other and the sets of driving pedals can commonly drive said dynamotor arrangement as a generator or drive a damping load, and in that said exercise bicycle further comprises a reaction training device which is common to the two users whereby the exercise bicycle can be used for both exercise and training. The exercise bicycle of the present invention can be used by two people and incorporates a common reaction training device, thereby enhancing its entertainment valve and promoting human relationships. Preferred features of the invention are defined in the dependent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are described below by way of example only with references to Figures 1 to 19 1 of the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 shows a dynamotor arrangement comprising a dynamotor set 1, the armature of which is connected to a double pole double throw switch 2 which is in circuit with a single pole double throw switch 3, a diode D1, a voltage stabliser circuit 4, a single pole switch SW3 and a reaction training device 5. The circuit is also connected to an accumulator 6 and a variable resistance is connected between terminal b of switch 3 and the junction of resistor R1 and Zener diode ZD1 of voltage stabiliser circuit 4. When switch 3 is in position a the dynamotor set 1 is driven by the user and stores electric power in the accumulator 6, as well as energising reaction training device 5. When switch 3 is switched to position b the accumulator 6 supplies electrical power to the dynamotor set 1 which exercises the legs of the user. The direction of rotation can be reversed by means of switch 2 and the power supplied by the dynamotor set can be adjusted by variable resistance 7, according to the age and health of the user. The arrangement can be switched off by switching switch 3 to the OFF position. The arrangement shown in Figure 2 is somewhat similar to that shown in Figure 1 except that the dynamotor 1 is a two phase dynamotor having a permanent magnet rotor and is connected via a single pole double throw switch 2 to a DC AC convertor 7. When selector switch 3 is switched to position a, the user can pedal to drive the rotor of the dynamotor and an output voltage is generated across stabiliser circuit 4 comprising resistor R1 and Zener diode ZD1 which is rectified by diode D1, D1 , D5 and D6. This voltage charges accumulator 6 and energises reaction training device 5, which can be switched off by switch SW3. When selector switch 3 is switched to position b, DC AC convertor 7 is energised from accumulator 6 via diode D2 and energises dynamotor 1 via switch 2. Accordingly the rotor of the dynamotor 1 rotates and applies passive exercise to the user s legs. The direction of rotation can be reversed by switching switch 2. In Figure 2, the entire arrangement is shown switched off, ie. switch 3 is shown in the OFF position. Figure 3 shows a further arrangement incorporating a separate motor 1 having D.C armature A and a dynamo 1 whose output is connected to a bridge rectifier comprising diodes D1, D2, D3 and D4. When selector switch 3 is switched to position a the dynamo 1 can be pedalled by the user to generate an output voltage which is stablised by a stabiliser circuit 4 comprising resistor R1 and Zener diode ZD1, the output of which is fed to an accumulator 6 and to a reaction training device 5 which is assumed to be switched in circuit by switch SW3. When selector switch 3 is switched to position b, the device is driven by accumulator 6 via variable resistor 7 VR1 which is used to vary the speed. The direction of rotation can be reversed by means of double throw switch 2 SW2 . The arrangement shown in Figure 4 is similar to that shown in Figure 3 except that an alternator 1 connected in series with a diode D1 is employed. The function of this circuit is similar to that of the circuit of Figure 3 and will not be described in detail. Figure 5 is a block diagram of an embodiment utilising a fly wheel 5 7 to coupled to a dynamotor set 1 for stablilisation and damping. When the system is driven th dynamotor set 1 acts as a dynamo and generates an output voltage which is rectified by circuit 4 and stablised by stabilising circuit 4. The resulting stabilised voltage energises a manual reaction training device 5. Figure 6 shows the arrangement in more detail and it will be noted that when the arrangement is driven by the pedalling of the user, the damping effect of the fly wheel increases the energy which must be expended by the user. Furthermore the fly wheel tends to stabilise the output voltage of the dynamotor set 1 which is supplied to reaction training device 5 via switch SW3. The mechanical structure of an exercise bicycle in accordance with the invention is shown in Figure 7, and it will be seen that the exercise bicycle comprises two sets of pedals which are coupled to each other so that they can be pedalled in opposite directions to each other and can commonly drive a dynamotor arrangement not shown or damping load not shown . Accordingly, two seats 12, 12 are provided on opposite sides of a common reaction training device 5 which is mounted between two handlebar frames. Figures 8 to 10 show the transmission between two chain wheels 221, 221 carrying pedals 200, 200 respectively and mounted on chain wheel axes 201, 201 respectively. Each chain wheel is provided with a chain 203, 203 coupled to driven chain wheels 222, 222 respectively which are mounted on axles 208, 208 respectively. Axle 208 carries a gear 226 which meshes with a gear 225 on axle 210 and this axle carries a further chain wheel 224 which is coupled via a chain to a chain wheel 223 mounted on axle 208 . This axle carries a damping fly wheel 207 and the bicycle frame also carries a friction belt friction gear arrangement for adjusting the damping not shown and a dynamotor set not shown . One or both of the chain wheel axles may incorporate a uni directional drive bearing. Another transmission is shown in Figures 13 to 15. This arrangement differs from that shown in Figures 8 to 14 in that axle 208 is mounted on two sets of links 213 and 214 which are pivoted about axle 208 , axles 210 and 215 being carried in the respective free ends of these links and being supported in slots 217, 216 respectively of the two sets of mounting plates. The threaded ends of axles 210, 215 carry nuts which can be loosened to enable the longitudinal position of these axles to be adjusted, and hence the chain tensions of the respective chain wheels. Figures 16 to 16 1 show a further transmission in which a gear 401 carried on axle 400 of one set of pedals engages a gear 402 mounted on axle 403. Axle 403 carries a damping fly wheel 207 and a chain wheel 404 which is coupled via a chain to a chain wheel 405 of the other set of pedals, which are mounted on axle 406. Axle 403 is threaded at its ends and is mounted in an arcuate slot 407 of a mounting plate at each end. The chain tension can be adjusted by adjusting the position of the axle in this mounting slot, on loosening the nuts. Conventionally, the fly wheel of an exercise bicycle is made of 10 to 20 kilograms of cast iron, which represents about one quarter of the total cost of the bicycle. In the embodiments shown in Figures 17 to 19 1, the fly wheel comprises two hollow metal shells 301 having a fixing hole 302 which are sealed against a sealing ring 304 of rubber or other soft flexible material as shown in Figure 19. The shell structure is filled with concrete, which is fixed relative to the shell structure by concavities in the metal shells 301. Such a design reduces the cost of the fly wheel by 40 .
