# METHOD FOR PROCESSING A BACKSIDE ILLUMINATED DETECTOR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A process for fabricating high performance backside illuminated detectors 10 is described. The process uses a transmissive adhesive 12 such as epoxy on a transmissive substrate 10 to hold the detector material 14 during the fabrication process. After fabrication and connection to a readout device 20 , such as a CCD, the substrate 10 and adhesive 12 are removed using an appropriate solvent, leaving the thin detector assembly 14, 16 , without ex traneous material, mounted directly on the CCD 20 . The process may be used for a variety of detector materials.
