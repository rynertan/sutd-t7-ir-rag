# Round top rimming machine.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an apparatus 10 for beading the edge or rim of a cup having a seamed annular sidewall and a polygonal base. A spinning head 12 having a plurality of radially moveable forming members 14 for contact with the rim to produce a bead is located over and in register with a cup supporting base plate 52 . The base plate 52 together with relatively moveable socket forming wall members 54, 55 provides a seat for the cup on a cam operated elevator device 60 which moves the cup upwardly. The socket is complementary to the polygonal base to prevent rotation of the seated and supported cup relative to the socket. The socket walls retract into a common horizontal plane with the base plate to permit rotationally driven star wheels 92, 94 to guide and confine cups onto the base plate in register with the forming means and off of the base plate away from the forming means. An air stream is directed into the cup to produce a positive pressure which inhibits dust from enter ing the cup during the formtng operation.
