# Lamp monitoring circuits.

## Abstract
It is an object of the invention to provide a circuit which will indicate failure of a motor vehicle bulb, even when the bulb is not illuminated, i.e. cold monitoring. This is achieved by the provision of a potentiometer R1, R2 and R3 with the lamp effectively connected across R2, R3 and a detecting transistor connected to a point C between R2 and R3. A small monitoring current is feed through the lamp L in the cold state and this keeps the potential at point A at a low level so that the transistor Q is not biased into conduction by the potential at the points C. Should the lamp fail, the potential at point A rises and transistor Q is biased into conduction to operate an audible and or visual warning. In order to provide for hot monitoring, a reed switch Y is provided to earth the point A when the lamp is drawing current from the supply line B. If the lamp fails, the reed switch opens and the circuit functions as for cold monitoring.

## Description
Title LAMP MONITORING CIRCUITThis invention relates to lamp monitoring circuits, particularly for motor vehicles.It is frequently not possible for a driver to know if a lamp has failed since the brightness of the light is insufficient for the difference in illumination to be detected from the driver s seat. This is particularly so in the case of side lights and rear lights.Failure of a lamp such as a side light or a rear lamp can be potentially dangerous both to the driver and occupants of the vehicle and to other road users, and to drive with a failed mandatory light is illegal.Systems have been designed that will warn the driver that there is a defective lamp when an attempt is made to switch then on.These are the so called Hhotw sensing systems.However, notice of failure only when a lamp has to be used is not wholly satisfactory, since, even if a spare bulb is available, the need for immediate replacment may be inconvenient.It is much more convenient if the driver can be made aware of a lamp failure at array time, whether the lamps are unilluminated. i.e. cold, or illuminated, i.e. hot.In order to provide for cold and monitoring, there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a lamp monitoring circuit comprising a potentiometer including a first resistance means of higher resistance than the lamp and a second resistance means, and adapted to be connected to a d.c. source, means for connecting the lamp in parallel with the second resistance means to take a small monitoring current and effectively to short circuit the second resistance means when the lamp is sound, means for detecting an increased potential difference across the second resistance means arising from failure or absence of the lamp, and means for short circuiting the second resistance means when the lamp is illuminated, the said short circuiting means being inoperative if the lamp is foiled or missing.The short circuiting means may be a reed switch operated by lamp current.The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying single figure of drawing which is a circuit diagram showing a preferred form of lamp monitoring circuit in accordance with the invention.In the diagram, the lamp is shown by the reference numeralL as being connected in series with a resistor R1 and diode D1 between a line B at supply voltage V5 and earth.The resistance of Rl is much greater than that of the lamp filament. Connected in parallel with the diode Dl and lamp L are a second diodeD2 and resistors R2 and R3. The resistors Rl, R2 and R3 together form a potentiometer and there is a pick off at point A to the diode Dl and lamp L and a pick off a point C to the base of a transistor Q which has its collector earthed and its emitter as an output from the circuit.The lamp L s normally operated by means of a switch SWI which controls a relay X having a contact X1 arranged to connect the lamp L between the line B and earth. In series with the lampL there is arranged a coil of a reed switch Y, of which the contact Yl is arranged to connect the point A to earth.With the line B connected to the supply Vs and switch SWl open two parallel current paths exist to earth. The first path is via resistor Rl, diode Dl and the lamp L. The second path is via resistor R1, diode D2, and resistors R2, R3. The resistance value of Rl is selected to be very much greater than the resistance value of the lamp. The resistance values of R2 and R3 are selected to be together much greater than that of Rl. Selection of the resistance values is such that the following occurs.With the filament of the lamp sound, the current I through the lamp is such that point A is maintained at a low potential with the result that point C will be considerably lower. Providing point C is held below the threshold potential of the forward conduction of the base emitter junction or transistor Q the transistor will not conduct. This will result in no output at the collector of transistor Q.If the lamp filament goes open circuit, the potential at pointA will rise towards V5. The selection of the values of R1,R2 and R3 is such that the potential at point C will then be taken above the threshold of conduction of the forward junction base emitter of Q. This will result in an output at the collector of Q.From the above it is clearly demonstrated that if an output exists at the collector of Q the lamp filament is not sound.The output of Q can be fed to an audible and or visual alarm circuit.If switch SW1 is closed the relay will be energised to connect the lamp L into the current at full voltage for illumination.The reed switch Y is operated by lamp current to close the reed switch to earth the point A.From the above it can be clearly seen that providing the lamp filament is sound, a current path exists from the supply V5 via the relay contacts Y, through the reed coil and through the lamp L filament to earth. The reed coil is designed to ensure that the reed switch is closed when the lamp L draws current.With the lamp drawing current, point A will thus be held at earth potential by the reed switch Y. With point A at earth potential point C will also be at earth potential and Q will not conduct. No output will exist at the collector of Q.Should the lamp go open circuit the lamp current will cease and the reed switch contact Y1 will open, removing the earth potential from point A. Point A will rise towards V5, pointC will rise towards V5 and Ql will conduct. It can be clearly seen that for a sound lamp no output exists at the collector of Q whilst for an open circuit lamp an output will exist at the collector of Q in both hot and cold states. In the absence of the reed switch Y to earth the point A when the lamp is conducting, point A would rise to a potential approaching V thereby causing the transistor Q to go conductive giving a false reading.Components RX, DX and DY shown dotted inthe circuit indicate that the resistor R2 and R3 and the transistor Q may be used in conjunction with other lamps and associated components so as to detect the failure of any one of the lamps. The diodesDX and DY act to isolate the circuits from each other for this purpose. The components RX and DX are of course analogous with R1 and D1, the remainder of the circuit components being omitted for clarity of illustration.Various modifications may be made within the scope of the invention.
