## Description
SPECIFICATION PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SUGAR CONTAINING POLYPEPTIDETechnical Field The present invention relates to a process for producing a sugar containing polypeptide. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for producing a sugarcontaining polypeptide comprising the steps of transforming a mammalian animal cell by a bovine papilloma virus derivedDNA in which a gene coding for the desired polypeptide has been incorporated in such a way as to ensure consistent expression of said polypeptide under the control of a primate viral promoter, cultivating the transformed animal cell, and recovering the desired polypeptide from the culture supernatant. The invention also relates to a culture composition containing said polypeptide.Background Art Many attempts have recently been made to produce useful and physiologically active substances by recombinantDNA technology hereunder referred to as rDNA technology .It can be said that the fundamental techniques for rDNA technology have reached the stage of completion on a laboratory scale. However, there remain many problems that have to be solved before the rDNA technology can be used on a practical basis. For example, the development of techniques for producing glycoprotein which frequently occurs in natural physiologically active substances is far from the stage of completion. In the production of useful substances by rDNA technology, procaryotic cells such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are extensively used as host cells, but these microbial hosts are not suitable for the production of glycoprotein.Therefore, an increasing amount of research has been directed to the production of glycoprotein by using eucaryotic cells e.g. yeasts and animal cells capable of producing glycoproteins as the host, but no practical host vector system has been established to data.For instance, attempts have been made to produce the desired foreign protein or polypeptide by culturing monkey cells e.g. COS cells into which a heterologous DNA coding for the protein has been introduced carried on a vector which isSimian Virus 40 hereunder abbreviated as SV40 derived from rhesus monkey see Hamer, D. H. et al., Nature, 281 35 40, 1979 Gruss, P. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,USA, 78 133 137, 1981 Gray, P. W. et al., Nature, 295 503 508, 1982 and Devos, R. et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 10 2487 2501, 1982 .However, the previous attempts have the following disadvantages 1 the size of the heterologousDNA to be inserted into SV40 and the type of host cells used are limited 2 it is difficult to transform the host cells 3 even transformed host cells may be killed by the introduced DNA which will act as a virus and 4 for these reasons, the expression of the desired foreign protein encoded by the inserted gene is inadequate. Some cf these defects have partly been cvercome by the development of new vectors Lowy, D. . et al., Nature 287 72 7, 1980 andSarver, N., Mol.Cellular Biol., 1 486 496, 1981 , but the are not yet sufficient to be used in the practical production of the desired glycoprotei. The present inventors have therefore made extensive studies in order to establish a host vector system that is free srom the above described defects of the conventional techniques and which is expected te be suit ble for comr,er cial use. As a result, the inventors have found that if mouse breast cancer cells are used as host cells and if aDNA comprising a ovine papilloma virus gene capable of expressing the desired foreign gene under the control of anSV40 early promoter is used as a vector, high yields of glycoprotein human gamma interferon, in particular can be produced with consistent results. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a process for producing a, spgar containing polypeptide comprising the steps of transforming a mammalian animal cell by a bovine papilloma virus derived DNA in which a gene coding for the desired polypeptide has been incorporated in such a way as to ensure consistent expressing of said polypeptide under the control of a primate viral promoter, cultivating the transformed animal cell, and recovering the desired polypeptide from the culture supernatant. The term sugar containing polypeptide used in this specification means that a polypeptide that will occur as a glycoprotein can actually be produced by the method of the present invention as a substance having a suger portion. A particularly preferred primate virus promoter for use in the invention is an SV40 early promoter. The method of the present invention is particularly useful for producing a sugar containing human interferon especially human gamma interferon in mammalian animal cells using a human interferon gene as a polypeptide gene.It is expected that the method of the invention is also applicable to the production of other polypeptides having a sugar portion. When producing a human gamma interferon by the method of the present invention, a human gamma interferon gene prepared by using, as a template, the corresponding messenger RNA from human spleen cells or human lymphocytes may advantageously be used as a gene coding for the intended human gamma interferon. Details of the DNA derived from bovine papilloma virus into which the polypeptide gene is incorporated, as well as the method of conducting such incorporation are found in the Example to be shown later in this specification, but it should be understood that said Example is not to be taken as limiting the invention. Any mammalian animal cells that can be transformed by the bovine papilloma virus derived DNA may be used in the method of the present invention, and mouse derived cells are one example.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of the neighborhood of the carboxyl terminal of human gamma interferon hIFN y , the corresponding base sequence, and the base sequence of the chemically synthesized DNA probe as indicated in the lower box used for separating hIFN Y mRNA Fig. 2 shows the restriction enzyme mapping of a cloned hIFN Y cDNA, as well as a schematic presentation of the method of constructing plasmid pIFY having a full length of hIFN Y gene from two hIFN Y cDNA fragments pY 1002 and p t 1018 obtained by the Okayama Berg method using pY 300DNA as a probe Fig. 3 shows schematically the method of constructing expression vector pdKCR IFN for expressing hIFN Y gene inCOS 1 cells Fig. 4 shows schematically the method of constructing expression vector pFNY for expressing hIFN gene in mouse breast cancer cells Fig. 5 snows the relationship between cell population and antiviral activity as observed during the cultivation of transformed Fry56 cells and Fig. 6 is a graph showing the effect of the concentration of fetal calf serum FCS in a culture medium on the production of hIFN z. Best Mode of Carrying out the Invention The gene cf a human gamma interferon hereunder abbreviated as hISN which is one of the glycoproteins that can be produced by the method of the present invention has already been cloned by Gray, P. W. et al. Nature, 295 5G3 508, 1982 and Devos, R, et al. Nucl. Acid. Res., 10 2487 2501, 1982 who also determined the DNA sequence of this gene. The present inventors independently obtained the hIFN gene from cloned cDNA fragments that were prepared by using, as a template, the mRNA produced by human spleen cells. First, human spleen cells are cultured in the presence of SEA Staphylococcal enterotoxin A . From the resulting mRNA, a cDNA bank may be prepared by the commonly used method of Hoeijmokers et al. Hoeijmokers, J. H. J.et al., Gene, 8 391 417, 1980 . From this cDNA bank, hIFN cDNA fragments are obtained by using a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide as a probe. Then, one of the cDNA fragments, is used as a probe for again isolating hIFN Y cDNA fragments from a cDNA bank prepared by the Okayama Berg method Okayama, H. Berg, P., Mol. Cell. Biol. 2 161 170, 1982 . The so isolated hIFN Y cDNA fragments may be properly conjugated together to form a full length of hIFN Y gene Hu IFN Y cDNA . For details of these procedures, seeFig. 2. The identity of the so obtained hIFN Y gene may be confirmed by the following procedures. First, it is inserted at BamHI site see Fig. 3 on a hybrid plasmid pdKCR containing a rabbit S globin gene, SV40 DNA and pBR322 DNA derivative pML 1 . Such hybrid plasmid was received from Dr. Breathnach of the INSERM Institute atStrasbourg, France. The inserted gene is used to transform monkey derived COS i cells received from Dr. Gluzman at theCold Spring Harbor Laboratory, U.S.A. by the calcium phosphate method Wigler, M. et al., Cell 14 725 731, 1978 .Then, the transformant cells are cultured and the antiviral activity in the culture supernatant is assayed by the method of Yip et al. Yip, Y. K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,USA 78 1601 1605, 1981 . Antiviral activity will be observed which is not lost by treatment with an antiinterferon a or anti interferon ss antibody but is lost by treatment with anti hIFN antibody. This result indicates that the obtained gene is hIFN w gene. However, the ability of the transformant cells to produce hIFN o is transient and a method using them is not suitable for use in the practical production of hIFN z. The present inventors therefore devised a more practically feasible method. First, a DNA fragment comprising the previously obtained hIFN Y gene is inserted at HindIII PvuII site on another plasmid pdBPV l a hybrid plasmid consisting of bovine papilloma virus DNA and pLM 2, a derivative from pBR322 DNA said plasmid was received fromDr. Peter M. Howley of the National Cancer Institute,Bethesda, U.S.A. and has been deposited with the AmericanType Culture Collection under ATCC No. 37134 in E. coli HB 101 ACTT No. 33694 . After deleting the pML 2 region originating from pBR322 the plasmid is used to transform mouse C1271 cells available from the American TypeCulture Collection deposited as ATCC No. CRL 1616 by the calcium phosphate method ibid see Fig. 4 .Subsequently, the transformed cells are cultured and the amount of hIFN y secreted into the culture supernatant is assayed in terms of the antiviral activity. In accordance with the inventors results, the amounts of hIFN Y produced by different strains of transformant were varied, but at least 80E of the transformants exhibited an antiviral activity. It is interesting to note that the culture supernatant of several of these transformants yielded a significantly high antiviral activity ca. 4.5 x 105 units ml . Not 2 single recorbinant gene expressing in an animal cell host has yet been found to exhibit such a high productivity. The present inventors confirmed by the Southern method Ssutherr. hybridization Southern, E. M., J.Mol. Bill., 98 503, 1975 that the plasmid pFN5 see Fig. 4 constructed by the present invention can be present in the host cell in large copy number 20 50 copies per cell and can be replicated consistently. There will be no doubt as to the presence of a sugar chain attached to the hIFN y polypeptide produced by the transformant in accordance with the present invention, because said active substance is adsorbed on Cont Sepharose, and estimation by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that said substance has a molecular weight cf 20,000 to 25,000 if it were a pure polypeptide, the molecular weight would be approximately 17,00n . The method of producing glycoprotein using the hostvector system defined in the present invention has the following advantages that make the method highly suitable for use in commercial operations the plasmid into which the desired foreign gene has been incorporated in such a manner that it can be consistently expressed has a large copy number and can be consistently replicated as an episomic DNA the intended substance is secreted as a glycoprotein in high yield in a culture medium and is therefore suitable for production by continuous cultivation. The method of the present invention is described above with reference to the case where the desired substance is human gamma interferon hIFN e . However, it will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the method is also applicable to the production of other glycoproteins such as human beta interferon and interferons derived from animals other than humans, as well as lymphokines such as interleukines 1, 2 and 3, TNF tumor necrosis factor and CSF colony stimulating factor , and hormones containing a sugar chain, and even antibodies. The host cells that can be used in the present invention are not limited to mouse breast cancer cells, and any other established animal cell lines that are capable of accepting the plasmid DNA may be used. The present invention is hereunder described in greater detail by reference to the Example which is by no means intended as limiting the invention. The plasmid and cells used in the method of the present invention are available from the sources already described.Example 1 Cloning of human gamma interferon hIFN y gene Human spleen cells 1.0 x 1010 were cultured for 60 hours at 370C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 bovine serum and 0.02 pg ml cf SEA Staphylococcal enterotoxin A and RNA 4 mg was extracted by the method of Chirgwin et al. Chirgwin, J. M. et al., Biochemistry 18 5294 5299, 1979 .Then, poly A RNA was separated by oligo dT cellulose column chromatography Aviv, H. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,USA, 69 1408 1412, 1972 . Subsequently, using RPS 40 rotor Hitachi , centrifugation 26,000 rpm x 19 hours was performed at 40C on 5 25 sucrose linear density gradient containing 50 mM tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.2M NaCl, 0.18 sodiumN lauroylsarcosine and 1 mM EDTA. Each of the fractions 0.2 ml was concentrated by ethanol precipitation, and one twentieth of the concentrate was injected into an egg ofXenopus oocytes so as to synthesize protein see Gurdon,J. B., J. Molec. Biol., 80 539 551, 1975 . Antiviral activity was observed in the fractions corresponding to 15S, which were collected and used as hIFN y mRNA containing fractions in the subsequent synthesis of hIFN cDNA. From the mRNA 20 Vg purified by centrifugation on sucrose density gradient, a double stranded cDNA 0.24 pg joined to pBR322 by the G C tail method was prepared in accordance with the method of Hoeijmakers et al. Hoeijmakers, J. H. J. et al., Gene 8 391 417, 1980 .This DNA was used to transform E. coli so as to obtain 4,000 clones of transformant having tetracycline resistance.In order to select the clones having hIFN Y cNDA, colony hybridization was performed using 32P labelled 14 mer nucleotide as a probe see Fig. 1 . The base sequence of this DNA probe was designed and chemically synthesized by reference to the DNA sequence of hIFN shown by Gray et al. Gray, P. W. et al., Nature 295 503 508, 1982 seeFig. 1 . Said labelled nuclotide probe was purchased fromMS Instruments. Four positive clones were selected by colony hybridization of the 4,000 clones of tetracycline resistance transformant. Subsequently, plasmid was separated from each of these positive clones and analyzed by cleavage with restriction enzymes on the basis of the base sequence data reported by Gray and Devos ibid . The analysis showed that the largest hIFN Y cDNA fragment obtained consisted of 300 bp while a full length of hIFN Y DNA is required to consist of at least 500 bp. This hIFN cDNA having about 300 nucleotides was therefore named pro300 and used in the subsequent separation of hIFN e cDNA from a cDNA bank. The cDNA bank in this separation step was prepared by the Okayama Berg method Okayama, H Berg, P., viol. Cell. Biol. 2 161 170, 1982 from poly A RNA 3 ug obtained by centrifugation on sucrose density gradient.Colony hybridization was performed by the same method as described above using pY300 as a probe. Two clones having hIFN w cDNA fragments were selected from 6,000 strains of transformed E. coli, and respectively named py 1002 and p 1018. The plasmid of each of these clones was analyzed by the same method as described above, and as shown inFig. 2, both cDNA fragments were found to be larger than py300. However, py 1002 lacked a 5 end portion while py 10l8 lacked a 3 end portion. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2, plasmid pIFY having a full length of hIFN Y gene was constructed by joining EcoRI PvuII fragment 1 includingAmpr , HinfI PvuII fragment 2 each from pY 1002 and EcoRI hinfI fragment 3 not including Ampr from pY 1018 by means of T4DNA ligase.The restriction enzyme mapping of the complete cDNA region, namely hIFN Y gene region, prepared from the pIFY plasmid introduced into E. coli was found to be identical with the restriction enzyme mapping proposed by Gray et al. ibid . 2 Expression of hIFN Y gene in monkey COS 1 cells The following experiment was conducted in order to check whether the hIFN Y gene obtained in 1 above would be expressed in animal cells and produce hIFN polypeptide. The expression vector plasmid pdKCR used was received from Dr. Breathnach of the INSERM Institute, Strasbourg,France. The plasmid pdKCR was composed of a DNA fragment in the initiator region of SV40 , rabbit tiglobin gene and a DNA fragment containing Blpr ampicillin resistant gene derived from pBR322 it was so designed that when a heterologous DNA was inserted at BamHI site, it would be expressed in COS 1 cells under the control of SV40 early promoter see Fig. 3 . Thus, the present inventors constructed an expression vector pdKCR IFN by first preparingSau3A DNA fragment of 850 bp by cleaving the plasmid pIFY, which contains hIFN Y gene and was obtained in 1 above, with a restriction enzyme Sau3AI and then inserting the resulting Sau3A DNA fragment into pdKCR plasmid at a BamHI site Fig. 3 .Subsequently, this vector was treated with restriction enzyme, HhaI, to remove the pBR322 derived DNA pML1 region , and thereafter, COS 1 cells received fromDr. Gluzman of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, U.S.A. were transformed by the calcium phosphate method Wigler, M.et al., Cell 14 725 731, 1978 . A control was prepared by introducing pdKCR free of hIFN into COS 1 cells. Two groups of COS l cells, one transformed with plasmid pdKCR IFN and the other by pdKCR, were cultured for 90 hours at 370C in DMEM medium Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium Nissui , purchased from Nissui Seiyaku containing 10 calf serum and the antiviral activity of the culture supernatant was determined. Antiviral activity that would be lost by treatment with anti gamma interferon antibody was observed in only the culture supernatant of the cells that had been transformed by pdKCR IFN see Table 1 . It was therefore confirmed that the pIF obtained in 1 above did have the hIFN y gene. Table 1 Identification of COS 1 cell produced interferon Anti interferon Anti interferon Plasmid Control serum serum a E serum w serum pdKCR 10 n.t. n.t. pdKCR IFN 1.250 1.150 16 n.t. not tested. As Table 1 shows, the COS 1 cells transformed by pdKCR IFN plasmid were able to produce hIFN Y but the transformed cells died very soon, resulting in only the transientFroduction of hIFN 5 by this host vector system. Therefore, the inventors proceeded with their experiment in order to construct cells capable of consistently producing high yield of hIFN . 3 Construction of cells capable of consistent production of hIFN w in high yield Plasmid pdBPV l received from Dr. Peter M. Howley ofNational Cancer Institute, Bethesda, U.S.A. was used as a plasmid vector having high copy number and being capable of consistent replication. The pdBPV l is a hybrid plasmid that has bovine papilloma virus DNA and pBR322 derived pML 2 vector DNA and which is capable of replication in mouse cells while maintaining high copy number 50 100 per cell . Plasmid pFNz capable of consistent production of hIFN y in mouse cells while maintaining high copy number was constructed by the procedures shown in Fig. 4. Stated specifically, pdBPV l was treated with HindIII and PvuII to remove the late protein region of bovine papilloma virus all of L1 and a part of L2 in Fig. 4 , and the depleted region was filled with a HindIII ThaI DNA fragment containing the hIFN Y gene region of pdXCR IFN previously obtained. Then, this plasmid pFNY was treated with BamHI to remove the pML 2 region originated from pBR322, and was thereafter used to transform mouse Cl271 cells by the calcium phosphate method described before. As a control,BamHI treated plasmid pdBPV l was also used to transform these cells by the same procedure.The cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10E calf serum that was replaced with a fresh medium every third day. Transformed strains observed at 16 days as focuses were established as cell lines. The frequency of transformation of C127I cells byBamHI treated pFNY DNA was about one fifteenth of the frequency of transformation by BamHI treated pdBPV l.However, 33 transformed strains per 10 vg of DNA was obtained. A total of 56 strains were obtained by transformation with pFNY DNA. The production of antiviral substance i.e. hIFN Y in the culture supernatant of each of these transformants was determined by the same method as described in 2 above the culture supernatant of 45 transformants had measurable antiviral activities in varying degrees. The ability of hIFE production by FY56 which was one of the transformants that exhibited high activity was further examined by the following procedures. Cells 5 x 105 were plated in DMEM medium in Petri dish with 5 cmS containing 10 calf serum and cultured at 370C. A cell count was conducted every other day while the interferon activity antiviral activity was measured daily seeFig. 5 . As is clear from Fig, 5, the antiviral activity increased until the 4th day of cultivation in proportion to the cell count, and thereafter, the antiviral activity continued to increase after the cell count substantially reached a plateau. At 6 days of the cultivation, the antiviral activity reached a surprisingly high level 5 x 105 units ml . The effect of serum concentration in culture medium on the production of hIFN y was also examined. The transformant Fy56 was cultured under the same conditions as used above and at a time when no further increase in cell count would occur i.e., after approximately 4 days of cultivation , the medium was replaced by serum free DMEM medium,DMEM medium containing 1 calf serum or DMEM medium containing 10 calf serum, and additional cultivation was conducted on each of the media at 370 C. The results of determination of antiviral activity in each of the media, conducted daily, are shown in Fig. 6. For the first three days of cultivation, both calf serum containing media exhibited a similar profile of increase in antiviral activity.The medium containing 108 of calf serum attained an antiviral activity level of 4.5 x 105 units ml at 3 days while the medium containing 18 of calf serum attained the same level at 4 days. The interferon activity in the serum free medium increased slowly with the progress of cultivation and reached a level of 3 x 105 units ml at 5 days. The above results show that the plasmid constructed by the present invention was stably maintained in the host cell, and that a foreign gene inserted into the plasmid was expressed very efficiently. In other words, the above results show the ability of the transformed cells to produce such a foreign protein as the illustrated hIFN consistently, effieicntly and continuously, suggesting the applicability of the host cells to practical production of foreign proteins. 4 Partial purification of hIFN Y and its physicochemical properties The Fy56 cells obtained in 3 above were cultured in a DMEM medium containing 10 calf serum. When the cell count had substantially reached a plateau, the cells were transferred into 0.5 ml of MEM medium Nissui containing methionine labelled with 35S 100 DCi and 10 of dialyzed calf serum. After continued culturing for 20 hours at 370C, supernatant 0.5 ml was obtained by centrifugation and mixed overnight with 25 Pl of controlled pore glass CPG 00350, 120 200 mesh, Funakoshi Yakuhin at 40C. Subsequently, the pore glass hereunder CPG beads was collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with PBS buffer 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 150 mM ofNaC1, pH 7.4 . Thereafter, the hIFN Y adsorbed on the CPG beads was eluted with PBS buffer containing 0.4 M tetramethylammonium chloride. By this procedure, hIFN Y could be recovered in a yield of more than 90 . The eluate 0.3 ml from the CPG beads was loaded onto 0.2 ml of ConA Sepharose Pharmacia Fine Chemicals column, which was washed with 25 volumes of PBS buffer.The hIFN 7 adsorbed on the ConA Sepharose was eluted by 0.1 M a methyl D mannoside solution in a recovery yield of 46t. The eluate was collected as partially purified hIFN and analyzed by electrophoresis through 15 SDS polyacrylamide gel using standard protein markers. As a result, the partially purified hIFN Y was observed as a broad band of molecular weights ranging between 20,000 and 25,000. On the other hand, according to the report of Gray et al. Gray,P. W. et al., Nature 295 503 508, 1982 , the polypeptide portion of hIFs 5 was composed of 146 amino acid residues and had an approximate molecular weight of 17,000. These results, i.e., the fact that the desired protein hIFN Y was adsorbed on ConA Sepharose and that it had a molecular weight in the range of 20,000 25,000, strongly suggest that the hIFN produced by FA56 cells is a protein to which a sugar chain has been attached. The hIFN Y gene cloned in the present invention contained a DNA region coding for a signal peptide composed of 20 amino acid residues , but with the host cells C1271 used in the Example, as suggested by Sarver et al. Sarver,N. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 1 486 496, 1981 , the signal peptide is presumably processed and therefore the polypeptide portion of the product of the invention is composed of a mature polypeptide chain, or a polypeptide having an approximate molecular weight of 17,000.
