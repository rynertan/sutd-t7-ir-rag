## Description
PROCESS so AND DEVICE FOR MAKING GRANULES CONSISTING OF FILLED PLASTIC The invention relates to a process for making plastic granules in which fillers are distributed. For making plastic granules in which fillers are distributed it is known to process the plastic and the filler in an extruder with granulating head. This process is energetically expensive and, if hard fillers are used, involves a considerable wear of the extruder parts. For the manufacturer of objects consisting of filled plastics it is an advantage to start from a plastic granulate in which the filler is already distributed in the plastic. The processing machine, for instance an extruder, will then be less liable to wear. It is the task of the plastics supplier to make low cost filled plastic granules, which requires, among other things, minimum energy consumption and limitation of the wear of the equipment to be used. The purpose of the invention is to provide a process for making plastic granules in which fillers are distributed, which process meets the requirements to be made. According to the invention this is obtained by feeding the filler to the surface of plastic web and pressing it down herein while the plastic is in a softened state and by subsequently cooling the web and processing it to granules by means of a dicing device. The filler can be pressed down into the plastic between a hard base and a pressure roll or between two pressure rolls. It is an advantage to apply the filler between two plastic webs, because the filler will then sooner be fully surrounded by plastic. While the plastic webs, in softened state, are pressed down, they will be bonded together and can, as one web, be processed to granules. According to an embodiment of the process according to the invention, the plastic is brought to a softened state before supplying the filler. The process, therefore, is particularly suitable in those cases in which, in consequence of a prior process, such as extrusion or calendering, the plastic is available in already softened state. The plastic may, however, also be heated in a different manner to such a degree as to be soft enough for the filler to be pressed into it. Heating of the web surfaces which the filler will be pressed into may already suffice. This heating can be achieved with heating rolls or infrared radiation. In this process it is not necessary for the plastic to be softened throughout. From an energy point of view it is an advantageous process to only soften the surface. The plastic can be softened also after the supply of the filler. According to a suitable embodiment, the heat required for this purpose is supplied in this process via the filler, which, to this end, has been brought to a sufficiently high temperature before being fed to the plastic web. The filler can be supplied in the form of threads, fibres, powder or grains. Particularly filler supplied in the form of threads permits of a very regular distribution in the plastic. The process is, therefore, particularly suitable for filling plastic with glass fibres. In this process the filler is fed to the plastic web in the form of glass threads. Not only that in this process the dosage can be controlled in an extremely simple manner, but the dicing applied according to the invention offers the advantage that the glass fibres are present in the plastic according to a regular distribution of length. The device according to the invention is characterized by the presence of means for the supply of plastic web, of means for heating the plastic and or the filler, of means for pressing the filler into the plastic, of means for carrying off the plastic web provided with filler and feeding it to a dicing device also present. The means for pressing the filler into the plastic may consist of a pressure base with pressure roll or of two pressure rolls rotatable in opposite directions. The pressure rolls may have a profiled surface. The method according to the invention will hereinafter be elucidated by means of an example of an embodiment of the device according to the invention shown in the drawing. In the drawing 1, 2 and 1 , 2 indicate plastic webs coming from respectively two slot die extruders 3 and 4 or from supply rolls 5 and 6. The webs 1 and 2 or l and 2 are brought between pressure rolls 6 and 7. Filler in the form of powder, grains or fibres coming from a hopper 8 or in the form of threads coming from a number of bobbins 9, the number of which can be chosen as one thinks fit, is fed to the surface of the plastic web in the nip of rolls 6 and 7. If the plastic web is obtained direct from the extruder, the supply of heat to tha plastic to soften it can be effected by the extruder itself. If the plastic webs come from supply rolls, the heat can be supplied by heating devices 10 and 11. The heat may also be supplied by heating the filler by means of a heating device 12. Once in contact with the surfaces of the plastic webs, the heated filler will transfer the heat to the plastic, which will then become soft. The filler is pressed into the plastic because the distance between rolls 6 and 7 is equal to or smaller than the total thickness of the plastic webs supplied. The surfaces of rolls 6 and 7 may be profiled somewhat, with raised parts on one roll fitting in hollows in the other roll. After the filler has been pressed into the plastic, in which process the plastic webs are more or less bonded together, the plastic will now be fed as one filled plastic web 13 to a dicer, optionally via a cooling device 15, and be processed to granules 17. The heating devices 10 and 11 may consist of rolls 17 and 18 heated with steam or electricity. Infrared heaters may also be used. Heating device 12 may also be an infrared heater. The device can also be operated in such a manner that the heat required for the softening of the plastic is supplied by a combination of the said sources of heat. The filler is supplied in a manner as to be evenly fed over the full width of the plastic webs. If the plastic of the webs is in a completely softened state, it is an advantage, for the purpose of obtaining a proper mixture, to allow an accumulation of material, also called bank , to develop in the nip of the pressure rolls.
