# Solid silicone defoaming agent and method for its production.

## Abstract
A solid defoaming composition, and a process for making the composition, is described. The defoaming com position comprises a solid nonionic surfactant, selected from aliphatic esters of glycerol and propylene glycol a solid, water soluble polymer, selected from carboxyvinyl polymers and poly vinyl alcohol s and a silicone compound, com posed of a fine silica powder and a silicone oil having a viscosity of at least 100 cS at 25 C. A molded cake of the composition of this invention does not bleed silicone oil and may be employed to defoam aqueous systems for extended periods without the need to replenish the active ingredient. The composition is particularly useful for defoaming septic tanks and sewage.
