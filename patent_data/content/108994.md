## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE 4R SUBSTITUTED MONOCYCLIC ss LACTAM COMPOUND The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of an optically active 4R substituted monocyclic ss lactam compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for preparing an optically active 4R substituted monocyclic ss lactam compound represented by the formula I EMI1.1 wherein Rê is an acyl group R is hydrogen atom, hydroxyl, an alkoxy, azido, amino, formimidoylamino, cyano, thiocyanato, mercapto, a substituted thio, dithiocarbamoyl nitro group, or a halogen atom M is hydrogen atom or a cation, which comprises subjecting a starting optically active compound represented by the formula II EMI1.2 wherein R1 is alkylsulfonyloxy, aralkylsulfonyloxy, arysulfonyloxy group or a halogen atom, to reaction comprising the steps of a conversion of the azido group at C 3 position into amino group with a reducing reagent b acylation of the amino group c substitution of the R1 group at C 4 position for a nucleophile and d sulfonation of the N l position at a temperature of about 20QC to about 70 C. The products of the present invention are useful as antibiotics and powerful p lactamase inhibitors. There are continuing needs for new antibiotics because a continued wide scale use selectively gives rise to resistant strains of pathogens.In addition, the known antibiotics suffer from the disadvantage of being effective only against certain types of microorganisms. Since the monocyclic ss lactam compounds having a sulfo group at N l position and a substituent at C 4 position were found in nature e.g. Imada et al,Nature, 289, p590 591 1981 R. B. Sykes et al, Nature, 291, P489 491 1981 , there have been known processes for preparing the derivatives thereof cf. JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication Nos. 125362 1981 and 131758 1982 . In the former publication, though there is disclosed a synthetic process of 3S amino 4R methylazetidin 2 one from allothreonine as a starting material, it is difficult to prepare compounds having a substituent other than methyl group at 4R position in this method.In the latter publication, a starting material of the 4R substituted monocyclic 8 lactam compound having an organic residue bonding to C 4 position through two carbon atoms is prepared according to the method for the preparation of cis configuration ss lactam compounds J. Am. Chem. Soc., 99, p2352 1977 using mainly stereoselective 2 23 addition ring closure reaction by W. F. Hoffman et al. The method, however, gives only a mixture of 3S,4R configuration and 3S,4S configuration compound in a proportion of 1 1. On the other hand, there is disclosed a process for preparing a 4 methoxycarbonylethyl derivative from 8 oxo 2, 2 dimethyl 3 oxa l azabicyclo 4.2.0 octane disclosed in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 100, p313 1978 1 by Johnes oxidation of the azido group at C 7 position and methyl esterification. In this case, there is no description of the next steps for preparing further various derivatives from the above compounds. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a 4R substituted monocyclic ss lactam compound in pure form. It is known that a bioactivity of 8 lactam antibiotics depends on its stereo chemistry, and the ss lactam antibiotics having 4R configuration exhibit particularly powerful bioactivity. For the purpose of preparing an optically active ss lactam compound having 4R configuration in pure form never obtained in the conventional methods, the present inventors have done intensive studies to obtain the desired compound from a pure starting compound obtained by enzymatic preparation using microorganisms and then by chemical preparation.In the course of the above studies, there have already been accomplished a process for preparing optically active aminoglutaric acid monocarbonate Japanese PatentApplication No. 132891 1982 , a process for preparing an optically active azetidin 2 one derivative from the above monocarbonate by the ring closure reaction JapanesePatent Application No. 25380 1982 , and a chemical conversion method of C 4 position of the resulting optically active azetidin 2 one derivative JapanesePatent Application Nos. 49526 1982, 49527 1982, 49528 1982 and 74377 1982 . There hitherto have been some reports on the chemical preparation of monocyclic ss lactam compound e.g. C.M. Cimarusti, et al, J. Org. Chem. 47, p176, p180 1982 M. Ochiai et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 31, p1874, p2200 1983 , but these operations can only give a limited kind of optically active 4 substituted ss lactam compound and cannot produce various optically active 4R substituted monocyclic ss lactam compounds. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved chemical process for the preparation of optically active 4R substituted monocyclic ss lactam antibiotics which are useful in both animal and human therapy. In accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a process for the preparation of an optically active 4R substituted monocyclic ss lactam compound represented by the formula I EMI4.1 wherein R2 is an acyl group R3 is hydrogen atom, hydroxyl, an alkoxy, azido, amino, formimidoylamino, cyano, thiocyanato, mercapto, a substituted thio, dithiocarbamoyl, nitro group or halogen atom M is hydrogen atom or a cation, which comprises subjecting a starting optically active compound represented by the formula II EMI4.2 wherein R1. is alkylsulfonyloxy, aralkylsulfonyloxy, arylsulfonyloxy group or a halogen atom, to reaction comprising the steps of a conversion of the azido group at 0 3 position into amino group with a reducing reagent b acylation of the amino group c substitution of the R1 group at 0 4 position for a nucleophile and d sulfonation of the N 1 position at a temperature of about 200C to about 700C. The starting compound 11 of the present invention is easily derived from 4S 2 methoxycarbonylmethyl 2 azetidinone, available by chemico enzymatic reaction M. Ohno, et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 103, p2405 1981 , for example, by using a method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 74377 1982. That is, the compound II may be prepared by substituion of sulfonate group of the above disclosed compound for a halogen atom in case that R1 group is a halogen atom, or by substitution of hydroxyl group of the 4R hydroxyethyl derivative disclosed in the aboveApplication for a halogen atom directly. According to the process of the present invention, the starting optically active compound II could be modified on three positions, that is, on N 1, 3 azido and C 4 positions. Depending on the kinds of reactants, the physicochemical properties of the products, or the reactivity or stability of each functional group, any suitable order of modification may be selected in each case. Representative examples of the process of the present invention are shown in the following reaction diagrams A to G .EMI5.1 EMI6.1 EMI7.1 EMI8.1 In the above processes A to G , the processes A to C are preferred. The detailed reaction processes are shown as follows EMI9.1 The reaction is carried out by 1 reacting the starting optically active compound II , wherein R1 is as defined above, with a nucleophile to prepare the compound III , wherein R3 is as defined above 2 reacting the compound III with a reducing reagent to convert the azido group into amino group to produce the compound IV , wherein R3 is as defined above 3 acylating the amino group of the compound IV to produce the compound V , wherein R2 and R3 are as defined above 4 and reacting the compound V with sulfonating reagent at about 20 0C to about 700C. EMI10.1 The reaction is carried out by 1 reacting the starting optically active compound it , wherein R1is as defined above, with a nucleophile to prepare the compound III , wherein R3 is as defined above 2 reacting the compound III with sulfonating reagent to prepare the compound VI , wherein R3 and M are as as defined above, at about 20 C to about 700C.3 reacting the compound VI with a reducing reagent to convert the azido group into amino group to produce the compound VII , wherein R3 and M are as defined above 4 and acylating the amino group of the compound VII . EMI11.1 The reaction is carried out by 1 reacting the starting optically active compound II , wherein R is as defined above, with a sulfonating reagent to prepare the compound VIII , wherein R1 and M are as defined above 2 reacting the compound VIII with a nucleophile to prepare the compound VI , wherein R3 and M are as. defined above 3 reacting the compound VI with a reducing reagent to convert the azido group into amino group to produce the compound VII , wherein R and M are as defined above 4 and acylating the amino group of the compound VII . According to the process of the present invention, the azido group is converted into amino group by catalytic hydrogenolysis using PtO2, Pd or Ni as a catalyst, or by chemical reduction with zinc powder and acetic acid or with sodium borohydride. Reduction with hydrogen sulfide or 1,3 propanedithiol is also used. In case of the R3 group being bonded to ethylene group atC 4 position by sulfide bond, reduction in the presence of 30 Pd BaCO3 or Urushibara Nickel as a catalyst is preferably used. Acylation of the resultant amino group is accomplished by conventional peptide forming methods, that is, i acid chloride method, ii mixed anhydride method, iii activated ester method, and iv DCC method are all used. As the R2 group, all acyl groups which are usually used in penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics may be used.Examples of R group are, for instance,D phenylglycyl, D p hydroxyphenylglycyl, D p hydroxyphenyl N 4 ethyl 2,3 diketopiperazine 1 carboxamide glycyl, and the like, and prepferable examples are, for instance, Z 2 2 aminothiazole 4 yl 2 alkoxyiminoacetyl represented by the formula IX EMI12.1 wherein R4 is methyl, CH2COOR5 or C CH3 2 COOR5 R5 is hydrogen atom, a cation. or an ester group . The cation 5 defined as R5 is an alkali metal such as lithium, sodium 5 or potassium. The ester group defined as R is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as pivaloyloxymethyl or l ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl group. The R3 group is selected from hydrogen atom, hydroxyl, an alkoxy, azido, amino, formimidoylamino, mercapto, a substituted thio, dithiocarbamoyl, cyano, thiocyanato, nitro group, or a halogen atom. Examples of the alkoxy group are, for instance, methoxy, ethoxy, phenoxy, aryloxy group, and the like. The substituted thio group is represented by the formula SQ, wherein Q is an alkyl, a substituted alkyl, phenyl, aryl, 2formimidoylethyl, 2 aminoethenyl, 3 amino 2 R methylpropyl, 3 amino 2 S methylpropyl, 2 amino 2 carboxyethenyl, carbamoylmethyl, or heterocyclic group such as 2 pyrimidyl or 2 pyridyl group. Preferable Q is 2 pyrimidyl or 2 pyridyl group. 1 The substitution of R group at C 4 position with a nucleophilic reagent is carried out in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine, triethylamine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine or diisopropylamine, or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate. It is preferred to adopt the substitution reaction in the first step of the process. In case of using an alcohol or mercaptane as a nucleophilic reagent, it is preferred to treat the nucleophilic reagent previously with a hydrogenated alkali metal such as sodium hydride or potassium hydride, an organic lithium compound such as butyl lithium, or an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, so as to form an alcoholate or a salt of mercaptide anion.When theR3 group is dithiocarbamate, thiocyanato, cyano or nitro group, an ammonium or an alkali metal salt having such a functional group may be used as a nucleophilic agent in the absence of the above mentioned base. The compound I , wherein R3 is fluorine atom, is prepared by reacting the compound II wherein R1 is mesyloxy or tosyloxy group, with KF in the presence of crown ether such as 18 crown O 6 in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran THF or 1,2 dimethoxy ethane DME . The R1 group is selected from alkylsulfonyloxy, aralkylsulfonyloxy, arylsulfonyloxy group, or a halogen atom, and preferably mesyloxy, tosyloxyl, or iodine is used. Introduction of sulfo group to N l position is accomplished by using a sulfonating reagent such as a complex of S03 with an organic base, e.g., pyridine, picoline or N,N dimethylformamide DMF . This sulfonation has been reported to be conducted at a room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere taking a long time, but the present inventors have found that the reaction is more accellerated by heating the reaction mixture at about 20 C to about 70 C, preferably at about 50 C to about 60 C for about 1 to about 5 hours under ordinary atmosphere using DMF as a solvent. The amount of the sulfonating reagent is about 2 to 5 moles per mole of the substrate to be sulfonated, preferably 2 to 4 moles.For example, the sulfonation is completed in 100 within 3 hours at about 60 0C by the process of the present invention, whereas only 50 or less sulfonation is accomplished at a room temperature even in 48 or more hours by conventional methods. The substituent defined as M is hydrogen atom, a cation or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, preferably sodium or potassium salt, ammonium salt, or a tetraammonium salt. In case of adopting the process represented by the reaction diagram B or C , tetra n butyl ammonium cation is preferably used as M, for making it easy to extract the intermediate sulfonate with an organic solvent from an aqueous reaction mixture.According to a particularly preferred process for preparing the compound I , R2 is Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyimino acetyl, R3 is 2 pyrimidylthio, and M is hydrogen atom, the compound wherein R1 is mesyloxy, tosyloxy or iodine atom, preferably mesyloxy group is first subjected to the substitution of the R1 group for a nucleophile, preferably 2 pyrimidylthio group by reacting the compound II with an excess of 2 mercaptopyrimidine in dry DMF in the presence of an organic base, preferably an excess of triethylamine, at room temperatures for 2 to 16 hours to prepare the compound III . The azido group of the compound III is then converted to amino group by treating with hydrogen gas in the presence of UrushibaraNickel A as a catalyst in ethyl alcohol.The product IV is acylated directly without purification with Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyimino acetic acid, preferably using a little excess, by a conventional peptide forming method and preferably by the activated ester method using l N mesyloxybenzotriazole in dry THF in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine or by DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide method in the presence of l N hydroxybenzotriazole monohydrate in dryDMF to produce the compound V . The introduction of sulfo group to N 1 position of the compound V is accomplished by reacting the compound V with an excess of SO3 pyridine complex in dry DMF as solvent at about 50 0C to 60 0C for about 2 to 5 hours. The optimum amount of the complex is about 2 to 5 moles per mole of the compound V , preferably 2.5 to 3.5 moles.The sulfonation of N l position in the final step of the process is much preferable because it is unnecessary to use tetra n butylammonium ion as cation M which is generally utilized to make the intermediate compound such as VI , VII or VIII easy to be extracted into organic solvent from aqueous reaction mixture. The product I is isolated from diluted reaction mixture using gel absorption chromatograhy. Though all the processes of the present invention may be carried out in a solvent such as an organic solvent or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, e.g. water acetone, waterdimethoxyethane, water THF, or water dioxane, the solvent used may not be particularly limited. A bioactivity of ss lactam antibiotics depends on the absolute configuration at C 3 or C 4 position, and generally the 3S enantiomer exhibits powerful bioactivity in monocyclic ss lactam antibiotics. The present invention includes both 3S, 4R and 3R, 4R enantiomer, and a mixture of them is also included. The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the followingExamples, wherein Rf values on thin layer chromatogram 511 TLC are represented as Rf 0.2, for example, and the superscript 511 represents a solvent system used. The solvent system is summarized as follows 511 EtOAc EtOH H2O 5 1 1 v v 311 EtOAc EtOH H2O 3 1 1 v v 411 n BuOH AcOH H2O 4 1 1 v v TAxy toluene acetone x y v v TExy toluene EtOH x y v v The 8 lactam compound was detected as a brown spot on silica gel plate by spraying 0.5 ethanolic solution ofNinhydrin after treatment with spraying 47 HBr and heating the plate at 1500 to 2000C for a few minutes.
