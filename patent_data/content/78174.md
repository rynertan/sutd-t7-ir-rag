# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING METAL THERMOPLASTIC RESIN METAL SANDWICH LAMINATE

## Abstract
A process for producing a metal thermoplastic resin metal sandwich laminate of improved bonding strength and secondary processability, wherein each metal layer is 0.1 1.0 mm thick, and the inner layer is a multilayered composite sheet comprising a thermoplastic resin core of which both sides are previously coated with another thermoplastic resin capable of adhering strongly to the metal.
