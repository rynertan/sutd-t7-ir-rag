Eine gram positive, bakterielle Expressionskontroll DNA Sequenz, enthaltend in Transkriptionsrichtung

## Description
The present invention relates to new gram positive expression control DNA sequences, to expression vectors containing these DNA sequences, to host cells transformed with these expression vectors and to methods for producing pro and eukaryotic proteins by using the new expression control DNA sequences, vectors and transformants. Most recombinant DNA work to date has been carried out with Escherichia coli E. coli . E. coli is a member of the gram negative class of bacteria which contain two layers of membranes enclosing a periplasmic space. Many of the products produced in E. coli are secreted into this periplasmic space, if secreted at all. Few products are secreted outside the living cells into the growth media. On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis B. subtilis is a member of the gram positive class of bacteria which contain only a single layer of bacterial membrane. Thus B. subtilis can produce large amounts of protein which are secreted directly into the growth medium. Moreover, production of proteins in B. subtilis is advantageous since the organism is non pathogenic and does not produce endotoxins. In addition, B. subtilis has been extensively studied and is the archetype for genetic studies among gram positive microorganisms. Although the general approach to gene cloning in E. coli is applicable to B. subtilis, attempts to produce a useful product of heterologous gene cloned into B. subtilis and secreted into the growth media have been retarded and made especially difficult because of the general lack of suitable cloning and expression vectors. This paucity of expression vectors is explained in part by the lack of recognition of foreign transcription and translation inition signals in B. subtilis.

Schoner et al., supra and the veg promoter European patent application, publication no. 116411 are the only promoters that have actually been utilized in gene expression. Under these circumstances, it is thus of advantage to develop more potent qene expression systems for use in gram positive bacteria, e.g. Bacillus, particularly B. subtilis. In this respect, the versatile expression vectors of the present invention are particularly important because they allow for the first time the expression of genes encoding prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins in Bacillus, especially B. subtilis, and other gram positive host cells under the control of transcription inition and termination DNA sequences of gram negative origin.

The present invention will be better understood on the basis of the following examples when considered in connection with the following figures Restriction endonucleases have been abbreviated as follows In addition, the following abbreviations have been used The following methods were performed as described by Maniatis et al., supra, unless indicated differently Restriction endonuclease digestions at 37 C pp. 100 101 dephosphorylation with bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP at 37 C pp. 133 134 ligation with T4 DNA ligase at 14 C pp. 390 391 transformation of DNA into CaCl₂ cells of E.coli HB101 and selection of tranformants on agar plates containing LB medium plus 100 µg ml of ampicillin pp. 250 251 DNA plasmid preparation pp. 86 94 filling in single stranded DNA tails with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment at 14 C pp. 113 114 DNA separation and fragment purification from agarose gels pp. 164 167 the use of synthetic DNA linkers in subcloning pp. 392 397 and SDS Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pp.348 349 . Transformation of DNA into cells of B. subtilis was performed as described by S. Contente and Dobnau, D. Mol. Gen. Genet 167, 251 258 1979 . In vitro transcription with RNA polymerases of E. coli and B.subtilis was performed in 50 µl assays of the following composition 40 mM Tris HCl, pH 7,9, 10 mM MgCl₂, 0,1 mM DTT, 0,1 mM EDTA, 50 200 mM NaCl, 10 v v glycerol, 150 µM ATP, GTP, CTP, 50 µM UTP, 5 µCi ³²P UTP 3000 Ci m mole, Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig , 0,05 p mole endonucleolytically cleaved DNA, 0,25 p mole RNA polymerase. Reactions were initiated by addition of RNA polymerase and allowed to proceed for between 1 and 5 mins at 37 C. Synthesised RNA was isolated by repeated ethanol precipitation and analysed by high voltage gel electrophoresis through 0,4 mm thick 5 or 8 polyacrylamide gels containing 8M urea. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodax X OMAT XAR 5 film at room temperature. Table 1 indicates the promoters which were used. Their potential was determined by in vitro run off transcription, the results of which are presented in Figure 6. In each case, promoter utilisation by B.subtilis δ⁵⁵ RNA polymerase has been determined as a function of increasing ionic strength, and compared with its efficiency when transcribed with E.coli RNA polymerase at 200 mM NaCl. Each transcription assay contains, in addition to the promoter in question, stoichiometric amounts of the B.subtilis veg promoter, previously shown to be efficiently utilised by B.subtilis δ⁵⁵ RNA polymerase Moran Jr. et al., Mol. Gen. Genetics 186, 339 346 1982 . It is clear from the data of Figure 6 that all promoters tested are recognised by B.subtilis RNA polymerase, albeit to varying degrees.
