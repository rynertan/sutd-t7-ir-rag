# Backup seal.

## Abstract
A backup seal for a main seal not shown sealing a rotary shaft 10 to a housing 12 comprises a rotary seal element 20 sealed 22 to the shaft 10 and a stationary seal element 16 sealed 18 to the housing 12 . The seal elements 16, 20 have opposing annular seal surfaces 41, 42 surrounding the shaft 10 and these are adapted to be urged together to form a running seal therebetween substan tially only by the pressure of fluid product leaking through the main seal should that fail. A second aspect of the invention provides a close fit bush 50 which helps to close the seal faces 41,42 together when the main seal fails and before any leak occurs between them.
