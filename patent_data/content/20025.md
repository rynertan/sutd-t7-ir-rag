# Process for making polyurethane foams.

## Abstract
Cold cured moulded polyurethane flexible foams having improved vibration damping properities are made by foaming in the presence of 1 a high molecular weight predominantly linear siloxane polyoxyalkylent block copolyner and 2 a solvent which is compatible with the block copolymer and which has a viscosity of 3 to 100 cps and a surface tension between 15 and 60 dynes cm.
