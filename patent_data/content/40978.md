# Fixing of tetra organo borate salt imaging systems.

## Abstract
It is highly desirable to have light sensitive imaging systems which do not use expensive silver materials in their construction, yet still have some of the proper ties of silver imaging systems such as their ability to be fixed. Light sensitive systems using tetra hydrocarbyl borates are easily constructed and do not require ex pensive materials therein. It has been found that the borates may be fixed by converting the tetra hydrocar byl borate to a compound which does not have four carbon to boron bonds.
