# HUMAN LYMPHOBLASTOID CELL LINE AND HYBRIDOMAS DERIVED THEREFROM AND ANTIBODIES PRODUCED FROM SUCH HYBRIDOMAS, AND THE PRODUCTION AND USE OF THE AFORESAID

## Abstract
A 6 thioguanine resistant subvariant of the EBV transformed human lymphoblastoid B cell line WI L2 is described. The subvariant line, designated LTR228, fuses efficiently with human cells. Human human hybridomas derived from LTR228 that produce monoclonal antibodies against tetanus toxin and blood group A are exemplified.
