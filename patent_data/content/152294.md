# Adaptive X ray lithography mask.

## Abstract
Provided is an apparatus for improving alignment accuracy by distorting in a controlled manner an X ray lithographic mask 540 to compensate for mask distortions induced primarily by thermally induced clamping effects in E beam and X ray exposure systems. A system of additional alignment sensors X₁ ₄, Y₁ ₄, Z₁ ₄ is used to provide localized misalignment information. This information is then used to provide feedback to a servo system which in turn activates electromechanically translatable clamps 610 630 which dis tort the X ray mask so as to minimize misalignment over the exposure field.
