# PLASMIDS AND CELLS FOR HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF METALLOTHIONEINS AND PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING AND USING THE METALLOTHIONEIN

## Abstract
Methods and compositions are provided for producing metallothioneins by recombinant DNA techniques. An ex pression vector containing a heterologous gene coding for metallotioneins is produced and transformed into a suitable host organism, from which metallothionein can be express ed. The metallothioneins can be used in vivo or in vitro for extraction and concentration of heavy metals. The invention described herein was made in the course of work under a grant or award from the Department of Health and Human Services.
