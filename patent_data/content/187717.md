## Description
This invention relates to a method of detecting and determining selenium quantitatively and a monitor therefor, and more particularly, it is concerned with a method of detecting and determining quantitatively gaseous selenium at a lower temperature than has been practiced hitherto by atomic absorption spectroscopic analysis. Sensitive detection and quantitative determination of selenium has lately been required by reason of the development of various compounds containing selenium for various purposes, for example, in the production of semiconductors, alloys, ceramics and glass. Atomic absorption spectroscopic analysis has hitherto been performed by atomizing selenium at high temperatures, e.g. 2000 It is an object of the present invention to provide a new method of detection and quantitative determination of selenium. The present invention is defined in claims 1,2 and 4 The temperature lower than the atomizing temperature of selenium may be in the range 220 to 1000 The accompanying drawings illustrate the invention in greater detail. Selenium is in gaseous state and is considered to exist as Se₂, Se₄, Se₆ and the like at a temperature of lower than the atomizing temperature, particularly 220 to 1000 The inventor has found a total of sixteen absorption lines 1 to 16, as shown in Figure 1, relating to this gaseous selenium. In Figure 1, the ordinate shows the absorbance voluntary units and the abscissa shows the wavelength nm . The wavelengths of the peaks numbered 1 to 16 are as follows In the absorption spectrum of Figure 1, the sixth peak at a wavelength of 335 nm is highest. Accordingly the present invention provides for the detection of selenium by selecting the peak at a wavelength of 335 nm or two or more peaks from the above described peaks 1 to 16 and simultaneously measuring. In principle, the method of detecting and determining selenium quantitatively according to the present invention can be carried out by an apparatus exemplified in Figure 2. Referring to Figure 2, emitting stage 1 emits a light corresponding to the wavelength of one of the above described peaks 1 to 16 of gaseous selenium. For example, the emitting stage 1 consists of a light source comprising a hollow cathode lamp provided with filters each having a centre frequency corresponding to each of the spectral lines 1 to 16. Sample chamber 2 is a furnace or cell provided with a heating means, which has a structure capable of retaining selenium gas, a window 3 permitting the passage of incident light from emitting stage 1 and another window 4 permitting the passage of transmitted light, after absorption thereof by the selenium gas, to a subsequent photo receiving stage 5 comprising an ordinary monochromator, detector, amplifier and meter. The principle of the method of detecting and determining selenium quantitatively according to the present invention lies in that the peak absorption of wavelengths corresponding to the lines 1 to 16 shown in Figure 1 can be obtained in proportion to the concentration of gaseous selenium. When the intensity of an incident light upon a sample chamber is represented by I On the other hand, it has been found that there is the relationship as shown in Figure 3 between the weight of selenium and absorbance D, i.e. Referring to Figure 3 , Point A represents the saturation point of selenium gas at a temperature t, which is defined by the vapour pressure of selenium as shown in the following formula wherein t is an absolute temperature. The invention may be performed with the apparatus shown in Figure 4. A sample chamber 2 provided with heater 6 received a sample containing selenium. The sample is heated to and maintained at a temperature of 450 For the further purposes of controlling the quantity of selenium supplied in a process or controlling the pressure of selenium, the method and monitor apparatus of the present invention can be usefully applied in various processes and apparatus for the production of semiconductors or semiconductor devices using selenium or to waste disposal apparatus. Examples are apparatus for the epitaxial growth of compound semiconductors such as ZnSe, CdSe and the like CVD furnaces, LPE furnaces, etc , high pressure HB furnaces, annealing furnaces, selenium pressure annealing furnaces, MBE apparatus, MOCVD apparatus and furnaces for melting alloys, ceramics and glasses containing selenium.
