# Dental abrasive disk.

## Abstract
Dental mandrels, circular in cross section, and detach able abrasive disks useful in confined areas of the mouth, in which the disk 14 can be mounted on and demounted from the mandrel 12 using finger pressure, and the disk 14 can optionally be rotated relative to the mandrel 12 when the mandrel is at rest, but the disk 14 is gripped sufficiently firmly when the mandrel 12 is spinning that no slippage of the disk 14 is apparent under dental grinding conditions. The working end of the mandrel 12 has a knob like terminal portion 26 of circular shape in cross section with a max imum diameter equal to or greater than the diameter of the circular hole in the grommet 16 of the disk 14 , a shoulder 22 for the grommet 16 and means for providing static disengagement and dynamic driving engagement between the knob like terminal portion 26 and the grommet 16 .
