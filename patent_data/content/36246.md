# Semiconductor memory device with substrate voltage biasing.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device comprises a sense amplifier 1 formed on a semiconductor substrate 10 , paired bit lines BL connected to the sense amplifier and memory cells MC connected to the bit lines. A predetermined bias voltage is applied to the semi conductor substrate, and a reading operation is performed by amplifying, by means of the sense amplifier, a voltage difference produced between the paired bit lines due to accessing the memory cells. A voltage of reverse phase relative to noise on the bias voltage applied to the substrate is fed to the semiconductor substrate via a capacitance 21 , formed on the substrate, to cancel the noise. By virtue of this feature, the influence of such noise can be minimised in the semiconductor memory device of the present invention.
