Our co pending application claiming priority from USApplication Serial No. 331,094 our internal reference numberK 3335 describes and claims certain novel compounds useful as herbicides. Certain ethers derived from the exo isomers of 2 hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,1 heptane derivatives are especially useful such ethers may be prepared from said hydroxy compounds. J. Chem. Soc. c , 1969, pages 716 721, describes a process for the preparation of 2 endo hydroxy 1 methyl 4 isopropyl 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,l heptane, However, no method is known for the preparation of the corresponding exo compound and related compounds. The present invention therefore provides a process for the preparation of a 2 exo hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,1 heptane, which comprises cyclising the corresponding cis 3,4 epoxycyclohexanol by treatment with an acid. Preferably, the exo isomer of a compound of the general formula I is prepared by cyclisation of the cis isomer of a compound of the general formula II EMI2.1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom a C1 10 alkyl group optionally substituted by up to 3 fluorine, chlorine and or bromine atoms or by a hydroxy group, a cyano group, a C14 alkoxy group, a C16 alkylsulphonyl group, a C 10 arylsulphonyl group, a C7 11 aralkylsulphonyl group, an azido group, a C 1 6 alkoxycarbonyl group, a hydroxycarbonyl group, a phosphoryl group, a phosphoryloxy group, or an amine oxide, carbamoyl or thiocarbamoyl group in which the nitrogen atom is substituted by hydrogen or by l or 2 C 1 4 alkyl groups an aryl or aralkyl group, each containing from 6 to 11 carbon atoms, and 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl portion, each optionally ring substituted by one or more fluorine, chlorine and or bromine atoms or by a C12 alkyl or alkoxy group optionally substituted by one or more fluorine and or chlorine atoms or a group CO2R6 or CON R6 2 in which R6 is a hydrogen atom or a C16 alkyl group R2 is a hydrogen atom or a straight chain C16 alkyl group each R3 is independently a hydrogen atom a chlorine atom a bromine atom or a C 1 4 alkyl group optionally substituted by up to 3 fluorine, chlorine and or bromine atoms or two R3 s when located on adjacent carbon atoms together form an epoxide ring or a carbon carbon bond R4 is a hydrogen atom or a C1 4 alkyl group optionally substituted by up to 3 fluorine, chlorine and or bromine atoms each R5 is independently a hydrogen atom a C14 alkyl group optionally substituted by up to 3 fluorine chlorine and or bromine atoms a hydroxy group or a C1 4 alkoxy group.

More preferably, R1 is a hydrogen atom or a C 1 3 alkyl group optionally substituted by chlorine, for example a methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl or l chloro l methylethyl group. Preferably R2 is a straight chain C 1 4 alkyl group, especially a methyl or ethyl group. Especially preferred for use in the process of the invention are compounds in which R1 is an isopropyl group and R2 Ú Ú is a methyl group R and R2 are both ethyl groups or R is a l chloro l methylethyl group and RZ is a methyl group. Each R3 is preferably independently a hydrogen atom a chlorine atom a bromine atom or a methyl or ethyl group. Most preferably each RB is a hydrogen atom. Preferably R4 is a hydrogen atom. Preferably each R5 is a methyl or ethyl group or, especially, a hydrogen atom. Most of the compounds of the general formulae I and II are novel. The invention therefore also provides a compound of the 1 4 and 5 general formula I or II per se, wherein R , R , R, R and R have the meanings given above, with the proviso that when R2 represents a methyl group and all of R3, R4 and R5 represent hydrogen atoms, then RI is other than an isopropyl group. The cyclization reaction is surprising in its relatively high yield of the exo hydroxy configuration of the resulting 2 hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,1 heptane. Many acids will catalyze this reaction, but a relatively strong acid, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric or sulphonic acids, or an acidic ion exchange resin, such as Amberlist Trade Mark sulphonic acid, is especially suitable. Preferably, the acid has a pKA of I or less. Most preferably, the acid is an organic sulphonic acid, for example an alkyl, alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acid, such as methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, p toluenesulphonic, m nitrobenzenesulphonic, 2, 4 dimethylbenzenesulphonic, or benzenesulphonic acid. Of these, p toluenesulphonic acid is preferred. The amount of acid used is not critical preferably it is used in amounts from 0,001 to 0.5 mole per mole of cisepoxycyclohexanol, suitably from 0.01 to about 0.1, and especially from 0.02 to 0.04 mole of acid per mole of cis epoxycyclohexanol. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include for example chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers, hydrocarbons, and ketones.Typical chlorinated hydrocarbons contain from 1 to 4 chlorine atoms in combination with an alkane chain containing from 1 to carbon atoms or a benzene ring, for example carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene and 1,2 or 1,3 dichlorobenzene. Preferred ethers are generally those containing from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, for example diethyl ether, methyl tert butyl ether and diisopropyl ether.Tetrahydrofuran and dioxane are also useful. Suitable alkanes contain for example from 5 to 10 carbon atoms petroleum fractions rich in alkanes are suitable. Petroleum ether is also suitable. Cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane are examples of useful cycloalkane solvents containing from 6 to 8 carbon atoms.Suitable aromatic hydrocarbon solvents preferably contain from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, for example benzene, toluene, o , m , and p xylene, the trimethylbenzenes and p ethyltoluene. Suitable ketones include acetone and methyl ethyl ketone. If an excess of epoxycyclohexanol is present, this may, if desired, serve as solvent so that no additional solvent is necessary. Preferably the reaction is carried out in the substantial absence of water. The reaction temperature is conveniently in the range of from 0 750C, in particular from OOC to 500C. Suitably, the temperature is from 5 C to 400C, preferably from IOOC to 300C. The resulting 2 exo hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2 lJheptane derivative may be purified by conventional techniques or converted without isolation into useful ether derivatives. The cis 3,4 epoxycyclohexanol used as starting material in the process according to the invention may be prepared by epoxidation of the corresponding cyclohexenol, using a suitable oxidising agent. Preferred cyclohexenols are those of the general formula.EMI5.1 in which R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the meanings given above. Any oxidizing agent that will form the epoxyalcohol may be used. Preferred oxidising agents include peroxy acids, hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, perphthalic acid, cumene hydroperoxide, persuccinic acid, pernonanoic acid, an alkyl hydroperoxide such as tert butyl hydroperoxide, persulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Preferably, the oxidation is carried out using an alkyl hydroperoxide or hydrogen peroxide and is conducted in the presence of an appropriate transition metal catalyst. Such a catalyst is preferably present in an amount of from about 0.0005 to 0.10 mole of catalyst per mole of peroxide, preferably from about 0.01 to 0.03 mole catalyst per mole of peroxide. Suitable transition metal catalysts are complexes of metals of atomic numbers 22 31, 40 49 and 72 81. Preferably the complex is an organic complex, for example with beta diketones, o hydroxybenzaldehydes or o hydroxybenzophenones and particularly with acetylacetone. Catalysts containing molybdenum or, especially, vanadium, are preferred for example, vanadium IV bis 2,4 pentanedionate oxide is especially useful. The oxidizing agent may suitably be used in an amount from 0.5 to 3, preferably in an amount from 1.0 to 1.2 moles per mole of cyclohexenol, most preferably from 1.0 1.1 moles per mole of cyclohexenol. The treatment with an oxidizing agent is preferably conducted in a solvent, ideally of the type also useful in the subsequent cyclization as described above. The reaction temperature is conveniently in the range of about IOOC to 750C, in particular from 10 to 500C.Generally, the preferred temperature is from 50C to 400 C, preferably from 10 C to 300C. The resulting epoxy alcohol may be purified by conventional techniques or converted without isolation into the 2 exohydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,1 heptane by cyclization. Especially useful for obtaining a 2 exo hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,1 heptane is treatment of the appropriate cyclohexenol with either tert butyl hydroperoxide and vanadium IV bis 2,4 pentanedioate oxide as catalyst in a solvent, for example methylene chloride, or hydrogen peroxide and the vanadium catalyst in a solvent, for example acetone, followed by treatment of the intermediate epoxide, preferably in situ, with a sulphonic acid, particularly p toluenesulphonic acid. In some cases, acid generated during the epoxidation step from a peroxy acid, e.g. m chloroperbenzoic acid, produces the desired cyclised product directly. The epoxidation and ring closure steps may be carried out successively alternatively, the 3 cyclohexen 1 ol may be treated conveniently with an oxidizing agent and an acid, to produce cyclisation of the epoxide in situ. Most of the compounds of the general formula III are novel, and the invention therefore also provides a compound of the general formula III per se, wherein RÚ , Rê, R , R4 and R have the meanings given above, with the proviso that R1 and R2 are not both hydrogen atoms, and with the proviso that when Rê represents a methyl group and all of R3, R4 and R5 represent hydrogen atoms, then R1 is other than an isopropyl group. The 2 exo hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,1 heptanes exhibit geometrical and optical isomerism. From the various optical and geometrical forms of the materials of the invention and various combinations thereof ethers may be prepared which usually have different herbicidal activities. The materials of formula I that have the OH group exo formula Ia below with respect to the oxygen containing bridge result in exo ethers usually more herbicidally active than the ethers of the endo hydroxy form formula Ib below or the exo endo mixture.EMI8.1 lS exo form lS endo form Formula Ia Formula IbWhen R2 is hydrogen, then the compounds of formula Ia and Ib have the 1S absolute configuration shown above. Such compounds of the invention of Ia that correspond in configuration are preferred. In situations where the endo form is desired it can be obtained by oxidation of the 2 exo hydroxy compound to the corresponding ketone followed by reduction of the ketone with sodium borohydride. The compounds of the general formula I are useful intermediates in the preparation of the corresponding novel ethers having herbicidal properties in which the hydrogen of the 2 hydroxy group is replaced by a group WCQ2 in which W is an optionally substituted unsaturated group of up to 4 carbon atoms an optionally substituted, aromatic or heterocyclic group containing up to 14 carbon atoms a C3 10 cycloaliphatic group optionally substituted by C1 3 alkyl or a C3 10 secondary alkyl group and both of Q are hydrogen atoms or fluorine atoms.These ethers and their use to control the growth of unwanted plants are disclosed in our copending Application claiming priority from U.S. patent application Serial No. 331, 094, filedDecember 16, 1981, our internal reference number K3335 . Such ethers may be prepared by treating the 2 exo hydroxy 7 oxabicyclo 2,2,ljheptane of formula I with a compound of the formula WCQ2L, in which L is a suitable leaving group, for example a halogen atom, such as bromine, chlorine or iodines or an organic sulphonyloxy group, for example a mesyloxy or tosyloxy group. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a strong base and an inert diluent, and preferably in the presence of a catalyst. The strong base is suitably an alkali metal hydride, amide, hydroxide or carbonate, including, for example, sodium hydride, sodium amide, sodium hydroxide and potassium carbonate. Inert diluents are suitably organic solvents, such as ethers, sulphoxides, aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons including, for example, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, methylene chloride and the like.Suitable catalysts are organic bases, such as tertiary amines and ammonium compounds, for example triethylamine or benzyltriethylammonium chloride. The reaction is most conveniently carried out under normal pressures and ambient temperatures. Suitable temperatures for the reaction are from about 0 to about 1200C, preferably from 20 to 100 C. The 3 cyclohexen 1 ols can be synthesized as described below or obtained from natural sources. a Where R2 is methyl and R1 is isopropyl, and the remaining R s are hydrogen, the compound is terpinen 4 ol, which occurs naturally in optically active and racemic forms, or can be prepared by epoxidation of terpinolene, followed by reduction of the epoxide. b Substituted l oxaspiro 2,5 oct 5 enes are useful for preparing 3 cyclohexen 1 ols where R1 is substituted by OH, OR,SR, Nor2, N3, P O OR 2. Treatment of a l oxaspiro 2,5 oct 5 ene with water or an alcohol in the presence of a strong acid affords the corresponding 3 cyclohexen 1 ol substituted in the l position by a hydroxymethyl or alkoxymethyl group. Treatment of l oxaspiro 2,5 oct 5 ene with thiophenol, or an alkyl, C6 11 aryl, or C7 11 aralkyl mercaptan, in the presence of a catalyst, such as sodium hydride, and a suitable solvent, produces a thio substituted 3 cyclohexen 1 ol that can be converted to the corresponding sulphonyl derivative in the course of the oxidation process described above.Where R is halo substituted, the haloalkyl substituted 3 cyclohexen l ol may be prepared by treating a spiro compound as defined above with an ethereal hydrohalogenic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid.From the haloalkyl substituted compounds thus obtained haloalkyl substituted ethers may be made which can then be dehydrochlorinated to yield the corresponding 4 alkenyl substituted ethers where R1 is alkenyl with the use of a base. Compounds where R is alkenyl may also be made by rearrangement of the spiro compounds upon treatment with protic or Lewis acids . Where R1 is substituted by an amine oxide group, a spiro compound as defined above may be treated with the appropirate dialkylamine in the presence of a catalyst such as triethylaluminum the subsequent epoxidation step produces the amine oxide. Where R1 is dialkoxyphosphoryl, the compounds may be prepared by treatment of a 1 oxaspirol 2,5 oc 5 ene with the appropriate phosphite ester. c Preparation of 3 cyclohexen 1 ols can be effected from suitably substituted phenols by Birch type reduction see for example Rodd s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Second Edition,Vol. II, Part B, pages 1 4 1968 . . d Where R is CO2R , CON R 2 , CN, or alkyl, the 3 cyclohexen 1 ols can be prepared starting from suitableDiels Alder adducts, followed where appropriate by modification of R1.
