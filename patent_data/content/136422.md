# LC FTIR system with thermospray solvent separation.

## Abstract
Effluent from an LC liquid chromatograph 10 is passed through a thermospray nozzle 17 which flash vaporizes substantially all of the solvent while directing any sample components as a collimated beam 19 onto a moving tape 20 so that the various components form spots on the tape. The tape is moved along a path that intercepts the optical path of the FTIR Fourier transform infrared spectrometer 30 whereby IR energy from the spectrometer is passed through each sample component and is then spectrally analyzed 40 45 . The tape can be wound up 22 , stored, and later used for further analysis of the spots, as desired, in the FTIR spectrometer.
