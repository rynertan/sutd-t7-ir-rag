# PHOTODETECTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An integrated circuit incorporating a PIN diode con nected to the gate of an FET, wherein the semiconductive layers used to construct the diode are also the layers used to construct the FET, and provide a relatively low capacitance per unit area for the diode compared with that ot the gate of the FET.
