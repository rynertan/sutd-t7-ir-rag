# Closure.

## Abstract
A closure for a container having a small diameter neck at the upper end of a generally frusto conical upper end portion of the body of the container, the neck being formed as a curl and providing a pour opening which is closed by a thin sheet metal plug 40 having a cylindrical wall closed at its lower end by a radial wall, both walls being expanded to underlap the lower edge of the neck, the upper end of said cylindrical wall being curled outwardly against a sealing agent on the upper end of the neck curl. The radial wall, the cylindrical wall and the curl portion are scored 52 to form a tear strip which is connected to a tab 55 which overhangs the body portion of the container and is operative upon being pwardly pulled to tear the tear strip and thus rip open the closure for easy removal.
