# Spiral type one way clutch mechanism and a clutch assembly comprising the mechanism.

## Abstract
A spiral type one way clutching mechanism utilizes a monolithic annular outer body member 11, 31 having an inner surface 15, 35 of spiral configuration defining an axially oriented opening therein. A monolithic annular in ner body member 16, 36 is concentrically positioned in the axially oriented opening and has an outer surface 34 of spiral configuration which is tangentially congruent to the outer body inner surface, the spiral surfaces defining a spiral race 21, 41 therebetween. At least one of the inner 16, 36 and the outer 11, 31 body members have a radi ally directed slit 17, 37 extending therethrough. The outer body member 11, 31 and the inner body member 16, 36 are relatively rotatably oscillatable with respect to each other. A plurality of axially oriented rollable wedging members, e.g., abutting roller members 22, 42 , is posi tioned in the spiral race 21, 41 , each such member being in contact with the inner and the outer spiral surfaces. Structure 20 is provided which acts between the body members, e.g., at least one limit spring 18, 38 for limiting the relative oscillatory movement therebetween. This mechanism is thus insensitive to transverse for ces substantially eliminates overrunning frictional wear on the critically shaped surfaces of its members and subs tantially eliminates the role of chance in establishing the clutching load distribution between its members. The me chanism may be used in a clutch assembly with both active and passive clutching modes.
