# Spectrally filtered lens producing plural f numbers with different spectral characteristics.

## Abstract
A photoresponsive apparatus is disclosed which in cludes a photoresponsive device that provides an output or response having a characteristic which varies as a function of the radiant power and wavelength incident on a photore sponsive surface thereof. Included is a spectral filtering means associated with an optical assembly so as to provide the assembly with different f number zones for each of the respectively different proportionalities of wavelengths such that the spectral composition of incident radiation reaching the surface is controlled by the spectral filtering means to effect a desired change in the response of the photorespon sive device.
