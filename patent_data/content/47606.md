# Input device for data processing system.

## Abstract
The device employs a page sheet unit 14 having a plurality of individual page sheets 140 each bound at one end to a base sheet 141 of the page sheet unit 14. The page sheet unit 14 has a linkage pin 142. The page sheet unit is fed in through an ex change mouth 4 of the device and is taken up onto a rotatable shaft 91 and wound up in the fashion shown in Figure 5 by rota tion of the shaft 91 in a first direction. To release a wound up page sheet unit 14 the rotatable shaft 91 is rotated in the oppo site direction. The rotatable shaft 91 is rotated in the first direction by a rotating force transmitted through gears from a drive shaft 92. On the other hand, the shaft 91 is rotated in the opposite direc tion by rotating force transmitted to the shaft 91 by an endless belt 93 through the page sheet unit 14 taken up onto the shaft 91.
