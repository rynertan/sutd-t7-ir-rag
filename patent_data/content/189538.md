# Apparatus for inspection of the walls of deep holes of minute diameter.

## Abstract
The inspection of the walls of a deep hole 12 of minute deameter in a strcture such as an integrated circuit board 10 is carried out by inserting into the hole a reflective optical sphere 14 having a diameter at least slightly smaller than the hole diameter. A coated optical fiber 18 having a diameter substantially less than the diameter of the sphere has one end attached to the sphere. An optical scattering means 22 is interposed between the sphere and the fiber to disperse illumination from the optic fiber to illuminate the walls of the hole. A source of illumination 20 is provided at the opposite end of the optic fiber, and an optical system 24 is positioned axially at the end of the hole to pick up the image of the illuminated walls reflected from the sphere.
