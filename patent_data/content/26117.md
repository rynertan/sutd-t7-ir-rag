## Abstract
Electrical contact 10 for an electrical connector, which contact in a first version comprises a plurality of axially aligned electrical conducting brush wires assembled together in a bundle 50 an elongated deep drawn holder 11 adapted for receiving the wire bundle 50 and having an axial passage, an enlarged shoulder 12 , and an intermediate flange 20 disposed rearward the shoulder 12 and bent radially inwardly from an inner surface of the holder 11 to a position immediately adjacent the opposite inner surface of the holder 11 to provide a checking aperture 30 rearward the flange 20 and a limit stop for the wire bundle 50 . An elongated deep drawn sleeve 40 having an axial passage 46 extending therethrough is positioned over the holder 11 to transform the first contact version into a second version of the contact 10 . The wire bundle 50 and the holder 11 , in the first version, and the wire bundle 50 , the sleeve 40 and the holder 11 , in the second version, are crimped together at a position forward the shoulder 12 by a plurality of dies spaced apart in a circular arrangement.
