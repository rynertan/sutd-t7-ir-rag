## Description
AN ENGAGING DEVICE EOR LENS APPLICABLE TO EYEGLASS FRAMES This invention relates to an engaging device for lens applicable to eyeglass frames. Standard eyeglass frames comprise two lens supports, each of which including an open ring of various shape, the ends of which are approached and maintained in contact with each other so as to firmly hold the lens. Said supports are maintained at spaced apart relationship from each other by a connection element and are connected to the side bars.At present, particularly in metal frames, said supports for lens comprise an open ring of various shape, the ends of which are made to contact and are engaged by a screw, threaded projections being provided at each of said ends. Such a type of engagement involves substantial disadvantages during repeated asse. ..blirg and disassembling where a lens has to be replaced. Vitus, the screws are of extremely small size for operation thereon and may strip particularly when repeatedly unscrew d and rescrewed, and the whole must be rethreaded. been, during use, the screw grip may become loose.Another engaging device comprises a connecting element fixed to one end of the lens support. Said connecting device is provided with an opening in which a projecting element, arranged at the other end of the ring , is inserted. m s solution is rather complex to carry out and its components must be realized with great precision. Moreover it envolves an occupation of space which is unacceptable for the present eyeglass frames which tend to be very light.Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide an engagement device for the ends of the supports for lens which pratically engages the two ends without any threaded elements and which however are formed by few elements having a minimum occupation of space. Said engagement device must involve a minimum cost and is directed for both nasal and temporal application, jus as provided in metal eyeglass frames of known type.This object has been achieved by providing a device characterized by comprising a snap engagement means, so as to maintain the ends of each support in contact with each other to build up a closed ring or loop of various shape. An embodiment provides that the snap engagement means comprise at least one resilient element apt to work on at least one projection provided at one end of the lens holding support, tnile the other end of the support is integral with the means engaging said resilient element.A particular embodiment provides that said resilient element is placed on the connection element between the two supports.Particularly, a solution provides that said snap engagement means is temporally disposed, that is at the side bars.A further embodiment provides that said resilient element is fitted with a lead in surface for engagement with the projection on the support end.A particular embodiment provides that at least one of the projections on the support end has a lead in surface for engagement with the resilient element.A solution also provides that said snap element comprises a resilient element associated with a pin, which is suitable for insertion in a seat on one end of the support while the other end is integral with engaging means of t.he resilient element. Additionally, both the pin end and seat may be made with lead in surfaces to help the engagement.A further embodiment provides a hooking element for holding the engagement between said pin and support end. An embodiment provides that said snap element comprises a hooking means for firmly holding the two ends of the support.A particular embodiment provides that said support ends are fitted with abutment elements for abutting against each other linen the support ends contact.A further embodiment provides that said hooking means are fitted with surfaces for snap engaging said abutment elements.The invention will now be further described by some embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1, la and 2 show a first embodiment for lens nasal engagement Figs. 3 and 4 show another embodiment similar to that of Figs. 1 and 2, but for a temporal engagement Figs. 3a and b show an embodiment similar to that of Figs. 3 and 4 Fig. 4b shows an explodes view of the few constituting elements of the embodiment of Figs. 3a and 4a Figs. 5 and 6 show a further embodiment for a lens nasal engagement Figs. 7 and 8 show a solution similar to that of Figs. 5 and 6 for a temporal engagement andFig. 9 shows a further embodiment also of temporal engagement type.Fig. 1 shows a detail of the engagement device of nasal type.The ring shaped is separated at support 2 end 2a and the end 2b, which will be hereinafter referred to as lower end and upper end, respectively. Sucii enJ s must be kept at convict relationship in order to hold the lens 3 there between. Each of the upper ends 2L are provided with two projections 4, as Showy in Fig. la. The connection means 1 between the twj ocular supports 2 are provided with a seat for a resilient foil 5. Said resilient foil 5 has a wedge like end 7 to aiu the engagement with the projection 4 which also has a wedgelike surface conjugated with the one of said resilient foil.Optionally, one of said projections 4 could be provided with seats or grooves not shown in order to aid any engagement with the resilient foil.The solution of temporal engagement is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. These figures show the connection element 11 which is fixedly welded to the lower end 12a of the ocular support. The upper end 12b is also provided with two projections 14. A resilient element 15 is fixedly disposed in said connection element 11 for engagement with the seat between said projections 14, as shown in Fig. 4.A similar simplified embodiment of temporal engagement is show in Figs. 3a, 4a. This figure illustrates a support having the end 52b terminating with a projecting element 54. A resilient element 55 is fixed in the connection element. Said resilient element, in the engaging condition, works on the projecting element 54, keeping it in close proximity with end 52a. Similar solution, i.e. comprising only one projectiug element may be adopted for the nasal engagement. Optionally the projecting element can terminate with a small pin 56 apt to penetrate into recess 57 arranged at end 52b of the support of course on different planes so as to keep uncranged the reciprocal positions of the ends during the nonral use, i. e when the lens is inserted within the support.Fig. 4b is a plant exploded view of the few constituting elements accorailt to this embodiment.In order to engage the supports with the lens according to the solutions shown in Figs 1, Ia, 2, 3, 3a and 4, such a lens is inserted in the open ocular support, that is with the ends disengaged. Then the two ends of the support are approached until the element 5 or 15 or 55 snaps urging at least one of the projections toward the ring end. In case, an element may be provided for covering the whole. Thus, the lens is fixedly engaged within the support. In order to disengage the device, an action should be carried out by a suitable implement acting upon the resilient element. In case, the cover element could be provided with proper slots for easy access to the resilient element without disassembling the entire device. Figs. 5 and 6 show a solution for nasal engagement of the lens.Also in this case, supports 42 are divided at the ends 42a and 42b. The end 42a is secured to the element 41 and the end 42b is provided with two suitably shaped projections 44. The nasal connection element 41 has a seat for a transversely arranged spring 45, which has small pins 47 at the two ends.Said small pins can snap into the seat 46 between the projections 44, thus clamping said erds 42a and 42b agairi each oliver. Obviously, said spring 45 is suitably blocked within the connection element 41. Also in this case, both the end of said srell pins 47 and at least one of said projection Mii are provided with lead in surfaces to aid said engagement.For the disengagement it is necessary to move the small pin 47, which must be accessible through an opening provided in the cover element. By a suitable implement the small piri can be moved, compressing the spring. In this way the smal pin disconnects from the recess 46 between said two projections.Figs. 7 and 8 show a further embodiment still for lens temporal engagement. m s embodiment also provides the ocular support 22 comprising the ends 22a and 22b. The lower end 22a is fixedly engaged with a connection element 21.Internally, said connection element 21 provides a resilient element, for example a spring 25, which terminates with a small pin 26 exiting from said connection element. A hooking element 28 is also provided. The upper element 22b of the support is fitted with a projection 24 internally provided with a seat 24a. In order to engage the lens with the supports, the projections 24 must be moved near the small pin 26, so that the latter would snap and insert in said seat 2Ma. Said hooking element 28 acts as a stop to avoid disengagement. In order to disconnect the assembly, an implement must be inserted for small pin retraction on the cover element usually provided. Then, possible slots are provided for access to the small pin, as well as lead in surfaces between said small pin and projections.Fig. 9 sI ows a particular solution for temporal application. The two ends 32a and 32b of the ocular are provided with abutment elements 34a and 3mob. Particularly, the abutment element 34a integral with the bar engaging device not shown is also provided with a projection 35. The two ends are approached, then the hooking element 33 fixed to end 32b, is engaged, which element is provided with at least a projection 33t for snapping and holding at least part of the abutment elements 34a and 3mob. Disengagement occurs by a known implement.It clearly appears that various solutions have been shown and described particularly for enabling snap engagement between the two ends of the ocular supports which, when holding the lens, must be firmly interengaged.
