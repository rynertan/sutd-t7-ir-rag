# Demodulator for multilevel amplitude modulation system.

## Abstract
Multilevel baseband signals are applied to a full wave rectifying section 30 which produces a first and second outputs P1, P2 . These outputs are applied to an analog to digital converting means 20, 22 which produces a plurality of recovered binary digital signal and an error signal y . A controller 32 is supplied with at least one recovered binary digital signal and the error signal, and produces two control signals y1, y which are fed to the full wave rectifying section to compensate a first DC drifts superimposed on the multilevel baseband signal and b second DC drifts generated within the full wave rectifying section itself.
