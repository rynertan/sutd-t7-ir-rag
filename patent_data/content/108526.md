## Description
METHOD AND REAGENT FOR THE DETERMINATION OF PEROXIDE AND PRECURSORS THEREOF Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to an improved method for the determination of peroxide and a reagent for use therein.2. Description of the Prior Art In a widely used method, the quantity of a given compound, e.g., cholesterol, in a sample is determined by treating a sample with an oxidase and measuring the amount of hydrogen peroxide formed. Generally, hydrogen peroxide is quantitatively determined by a method wherein the hydrogen peroxide is reacted with a colorimetric reagent comprising a peroxidase, a hydrogen donor, and an electron or radical acceptor which react together stoichiometrically with the hydrogen peroxide to form a pigment. The amount of hydrogen peroxide is then calculated from the relationship between the amount of pigment formed and the absorbancy at a visible portion of the spectrum. As the hydrogen donor, the colorimetric reagent generally contains a compound such as phenol, dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, o tolidine, o toluidine, ptoluidine, o phenylenediamine, N,N dimethyl p phenylenediamine, benzidine, o anisidine, p anisidine, dianisidine, o cresol, m cresol, a naphthol, B naphthol, catechol, guaiacol, pyrogallol, 2,7 diaminofluorene, leucoindophenol, 2,4 dichlorophenol, or 2 hydroxyl 3,5 dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid. As the electron or radical acceptor, the colorimetric reagent generally contains a compound such as 2 thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazine, benzidine, 3 methyl 2 benz thiazoli one hydrazone, and a 4 aminoantipyrine represented by the formulaEMI2.1 wherein each of R and R1, when taken separately, is alkyl, R2 is an aromatic moiety, each of R3 and R4, when taken separately, is selected from a group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, and Y is selected from a group consisting of oxygen and sulfur. As the peroxide activiting agent, the colorimetric reagent generally contains a compound selected from a group consisting of peroxidase, tungstic acid, salts of tungstic acid, molybdic acid, salts of molybdic acid, a mixture of an iodide and one of these inorganic compounds, and ions of iron, copper, cerium, and vanadic acid. Of the hyrogen donors listed above, only phenol, 3,4 dichiorophenol, and 2 hydroxyl 3,5dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid are commonly employed in commercial colorimetric reagents. These hydrogen donors have various disadvantages, e.g., unpleasant odor phenol and 2,4 dichlorophenol , poor stability, 2 hydroxyl 3,5dichlorobenzenesulfonic acid , or relatively low sensitivity phenol . Although a considerable amount of research has been carried out in this area 1 5 , there is still a need for an improved hydrogen donor for use in a colorimetric reagent for the determination of peroxide or a precursor thereof.

More preferably, the colorimetric reagent and method of the instant invention are used for the determination of hydrogen peroxide. In a particular aspect of the present invention, the above described colorimetric reagent and method are used in the quantitative determination of precursor materials such as glucose, uric acid, cholesterol, choline esterase, phospholipid, or creatinine. These precursor materials can be converted incrematically and quantitatively into hydrogen peroxide using an oxidase enzyme. To this end, there may be included in the colorimetric reagent of this invention an oxidase capable of quantitatively converting a precursor material into hydrogen peroxide, whereby the amount of such precursor material present in the original sample may be determined . Correspondingly, the present invention also includes a method of determining the amount of such precursor material in a sample by treating that precursor material with an oxidase and quantitatively determining the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced by a method as above defined using the compounds for Formula I as the hydrogen donor. The method and reagent of this invention may thus be used in the determination of cholesterol, phospholipid, glucose, uric acid, etc., by initial treatment of the sample with an enzyme such as, respectively, a cholesterol oxidase, a choline oxidase, a glucose oxidase, or a uricase followed by colorimetric determination of the hydrogen peroxide used by measuring the visual absorbancy of the sample when subsequently treated with the colorimetric reagent, i.e., the peroxidase in combination with the hydrogen donor and the electron or radical acceptor. In the present invention, the hydrogen donor is used in an amount enough to react with hydrogen peroxide present or formed in situ in the sample. This amount is generally 2 to 5 equivalents to hydrogen peroxide. The absorbancy of the colored solution produced is then measured at a visible portion of from about 490 to about 530 nm and the amount of hydrogen peroxide is calculated from a standard curve for a standard sample. The present invention also provides a kit consisting of an oxidase capable of reacting with a precursor material to produce hydrogen peroxide, and a colorimetric pick up system for quantitatively converting the formed hydrogen peroxide into a colorimetrically detectable product. The following examples are provided for the purpose of further illustration only and are not intended to be limitations on the disclosed invention. Example 1 Reagent Within the Scope of Invention A reagent containing the following ingredients was prepared Ingredients Concentration cholesterol esterase 1 IU ml cholesterol oxidase 0.5 IU ml peroxidase horseradish 100 IU ml Na cholate 6.9 mM 4 aminoantipyrine 1.6 mM m hydroxy benzoic acid 5 mM buffer sodium phosphate 100 mM pH variable Example 2 Reagent Outside the Scope of Invention A reagent containing the same ingredients with one modification was prepared. The sole modification was the use of 5 mM phenol in place of the 5 mM m hydroxy benzoic acid. Phenol is hydroscopic and possesses an unpleasant, strong, pungent odor. In contrast, m hydroxy benzoic acid and the other hydrogen donors listed inTable I do not possess any unpleasant odor and are not hydroscopic. Accordingly, the hydrogen donors suggested for use in the present invention are easier to work with due to their different physical properties. Example 3 Assay Procedure Within Scope of Invention An aliquot 1 ml of the reagent prepared inExample 1 was placed in a spectrophotometric cuvette.The optical density OD thereof was read at 500 nm. An aliquot 10 pl of a calibrator 200 mg dl cholesterol was then introduced into the cuvette and mixed. The reaction was incubated at 300 C. and allowed to each an end point. After about 10 minutes the OD was read. The data obtained from this experiment is set forth in TableII. Example 4 Assay Procedure Outside Scope of Invention The methodology employed in Example 3 was repeated using the reagent of Example 2. The data obtained is also set forth in Table II. Table II pH A Reagent Within Scope of Invention Example 3 6.5 0.320 7.0 0.385 7.5 0.395 Reagent Outside Scope of Invention Example 4 7.5 0.330 The data set forth in Table II indicate that one is able to obtain an increase in sensitivity of approximately 20 by using a reagent system differing solely in that, instead of employing phenol, the hydrogen donor employed therein is one within the scope of the instant invention, namely, m hydroxy benzoic acid. Based on this disclosure, many other modifications and ramifications will naturally suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. These are intended to be comprehended as within the scope of this invention.
