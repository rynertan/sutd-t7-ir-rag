# Thermoset acrylic resin composition for coating metallic materials and stainless steel coated with the composition.

## Abstract
A thermoset acrylic resin composition for coating metallic materials, particularly stainless steel, having a superior adhe sion thereonto and hence giving superior resistance to forming after coating, and a stainless steel piece coated with a coating material comprising the above composition, followed by bak ing, and having a superior colourability and endurability, are provided, which compositions is obtained by radical copoly merizing a 40 to 80 by weight an acrylic or methacrylic acid ester having 1 to 12 C in the ester moiety, b 20 to 5 by weight a hydroxyl group or epoxy group containing acrylic or methacrylic acid ester, c 20 to 0.01 by weight a vinyl group containing polysiloxane and d 20 to 2 by weight a vinyl group containing silane compound, these by weight being based on the total weight of monomers a to d .
