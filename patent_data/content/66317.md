# Modular data storage system.

## Abstract
A modular data storage system for a plurality of identical data carriers 3 comprises at least one recorder apparatus 9 and at least one storage module 10 , the storage modules comprising an internal transport device 32 and an external sport device 13 outside the storage modules, which external transport device can transport data carriers between a recorder apparatus and the storage modules. The recorder apparatus is constituted by a recorder module which together with the storage modules can be arranged on top of and adjacent each other to form an optical configuration adapted to suit specific requirements and the external transport device cooperates with all recorder and storage modules at the back and is located inside the cabinet of the modular data storage system.
