# Improvements in or relating to secondary surveillance radar.

## Abstract
A secondary surveillance radar is arranged to monitor the relative amplitudes of sum signals and difference signals received from a target in response to interrogations. Only those replies for which the sum signal exceeds the difference signal by a predetermined amplitude are accepted as valid to avoid degradation of the performance of the radar due to punch through . Punch through stems from distortions in the radiation pattern of the radar and is often caused by reflections of the radar signals by large objects. A directional receiving antenna 3 generates sum Σ and difference Δ signals, and replies are accepted as valid and gated to an output 21 only if a quantity log Δ Σ exceeds a reference 19 when compared at the comparator 18.
