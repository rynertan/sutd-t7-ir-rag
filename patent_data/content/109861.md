# METHOD FOR ISOLATING CELLS

## Abstract
A method for isolating from a cell population those cells producing and secreting antibody exhibiting a high binding affinity for a particular antigen. The isolation depends upon the ability of any such antibody to displace from the antigen previously bound F ab fragments of antibodies exhibiting less binding affinity for the antigen, and then using the F c region of any such displacing antibody as a site for the binding of materials which bring about a selective distin guishable condition which can be used as an indicator of the location of cells in the population which produced and secreted the displacing antibody.
