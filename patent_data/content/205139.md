# Distributed feedback semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a distributed feedback semicon ductor laser device and a method of manufacturing a semi conductor laser. The semiconductor laser device comprises an active layer for emitting light in response to the injection of current, a diffraction grating neighboring said active layer to interact with the light, current injecting means for injecting current into said active layer and control means for controlling the distribution of current which is injected into said active layer in a configuration which corresponds to the field intensi ty ditribution of the light in the direction of the laser optical axis inside said active layer. The semiconductor laser device is operable in a stable single mode and producible in a high yield.
