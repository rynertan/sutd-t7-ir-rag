# An air fuel induction system for a multi cylinder internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An air fuel induction system includes a pair of solenoid valves injecting fuel into an induction passage of a multicylin der engine. The valves supply fuel upstream of the inlet mani fold to the engine and do not therefore direct fuel to specific cylinders. The solenoids 36, 36a operate alternetely through pulses developed by drive units controlled by a microproces sor based control unit 19 . Each valve is independently timed by a respective timer counter 44, 45 and valve operation overlaps in some circumstances. This allows smaller valves to be used and overcomes the problem of gusting at low speeds. The system may be applied to an LGP fuel system used as an additional fuel supply.
