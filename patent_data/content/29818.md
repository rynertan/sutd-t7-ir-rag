## Description
DiSCHIPTION Arrangement in FloorsTechnical Field The invention relates to an arrangement in floor of the kind which under h load carrying layer of boards or panels, is provided with heating means in the form of pipes, adapted for having a heating medium in the vapour or liquid phase flowing through them.Background Art Previously known floors which are heated by means of pipes, through which a heating medium flows, generally have their pipes laid in concrete in the form of repeatedly S bent coils or serpentines. Such coils have also been laid in sand beds under so called floating floors, and it has also occurred that the coils have been freely arranged under a floor on studs.Floors with the pipes laid in concrete or sand are slower to regulate than is desired, and all the previously known floor types result in fairly uneven temperature distribution over the floor surface. If the heating medium leaks as a result of damage to some pipe coil, the whole floor, or large portions thereof, must be broken up to localize the leak and to make the necessary repairs, after which a new floor must be laid either completely or partially. Possible leakage thus generally leads to very extensive and expensive work.Disclosure of Invention The object of the invention is therefore to provide a means of the kind described in the introduction, the pipe system of which can be easily repaired by exchanging damaged pipe sections, after work on the floor of small destructiveness or extent. The desired result is obtained by the arrangement being given the characterizing features apparent from the following patent claim 1.Brief Description of Drawings Some embodiments of the invention are desoribed in detail in the following while referring to the appended drawings. Figure 1 is a partial view of the arrangement in accordance with the invention, seen from above with the whole of the load carrying floor layer removed. Figure 2 illustrates to a larger scale a vertical section according to 11 11 in Figure 1. Figure 3 similarly illustrates to a larger scale a vertical section along the line III III in Figure 1. Figure 4 also shows to a larger scale a vertical partial section according to IV IV in Figure 1, supplemented by a load carrying floor layer of panels not shown inFigure 1 which is covered by a carpet. Figures 5 and 6 show to an even larger scale a vertical partial section according to V v in Figure 1, supplemented by a metal foil layer not shown in Figure 1. diode for Carrying Out the Invention The arrangement is applicable to floors of the kind which are provided with heating means in the form of pipes 2 under a load carrying floor layer 1 Figure 4 of boards or panels, said pipes being adapted for flowing through by a heaS ing medium in the vapour or liquid phase. The arrangement has a sub floor of heat insulating slabs 3, the word slabs also intended to signify here members with a thickness in relation to their other two chief dimensions such that they have the character of blooks. These slabs are formed with upwardly open channels 4 for the pipes 2. Along two opposing walls of the room the slab floor is provided with recesses 5 running along each of these walls. Figures 1 3 show the recess 5 at one wall. The arrangement of a corresponding recess along the other wall is thus also a prerequisite.Distribution and collection heads 6 for the pipes 2 are arranged in the recesses 5. If the head 6 illustrated in Figure 1 is assumed to be a distribution head, the head not shown at the opposing wall is a collection head, and vice versa. The pipes 2 thus run connected in parallel between these heads and each pipe is removably connected to the head by means of connectors 7 adjacent each head 6. The load carrying floor layer 1 in the area of each recess 5 is made with removable or openable boards or panels 8 Figure 4 . The simple arrangement of openings is thus enabled along both the opposing walls, whereby the recesses 5 and the distribution and collection heads 6 are completely laid open. The pipes 2 are of the soft kind, e.g. soft pipes with the trade name Wirsbo PEX and so flexible that they oan be pulled out of the channels 4 as well as being pushed into said channels, via the openings just mentioned, which have been afforded by the boards or panels 8 being removed or opened. If there is damage to some pipe 2, it can thus be dismantled and replaced by a new one without the floor needing to be broken up in the area of the damage. The heat insulating slabs 3 suitably constitute cellular plastic slabs known per se, with let in nailing battons 9 Figures 1 and 4 on their upper sides for attaching the floor layer 1 see Swedish Patent specification 73 17276 9 . As is apparent from Figure 1 channels 4 for the pipes 2 have been made in slabs of this kind, the channels being parallel to the nailing battons 9, while the recesses 5 for the distribution and collection heads 6 are oriented substantially at right angles to the channels 4 in separate cellular plastic slabs 10. In oomparison with a pipe coil which runs conventionally in the floor with repeated S bends, the pipes 2, connected in parallel offer a generally more even temperature distribution over the floor surface. In order to provide further temperature equilization within part surfaces of the floor, it is suitable to make the sub floor slabs 3 with a plurality of upwardly open grooves 11, crossing the channels 4 and arranged in all such areas of the slabs through which the channels 4 extend. Por the sake of simplicity however, these grooves 11 have only been set out on the drawings in Pigures 1 and 2 within a minor section of the sub floor.These grooves can have a certain equilizing effect by serving as air ducts for heat transport by convection, but can also be filled with a material with substantially better heat conductivity than the material in the heat insulating slabs 3. The filling not shown oan to advantage constitute a granular material, e.g. sand, and a binder, e.g. waterglass. With the same aim, the channels 4 can be clad with a material having good heat conductivity and preferably good radiation absorbing capaoity, e.g. a mat blaok metal foil 12, following the bottom and side walls of the channel, and possibly extending a distance out over the upper side of the sub floor 3 on either side of the channel 4, as illustrated in Figure 5.The foil 12 can to advantage be laid out over substantially te whole of the surface of the sub floor, e.g. extending between the nailing battons 9, but not covering them, with regard to possible glueing of the floor layer 1 to the battons. Alternatively or even additionally, the ducts 4 oan be covered by foils 13 having good heat conductivity, as illustrated in Figure 6, e.g. aluminium foil, which are laid out on the upper side of the sub floor. The foil 13 and or the foil 12 suitably extend a good distance out on either side of the channel it covers, or substantially over the whole of the floor surface. At least the part of it exposed to the pipe 2 can be made with good radiation absorbing capacity. Further to oontributing to better heat distribution, the foil 12 has the task of carrying the pipes 2 and affords less friction than the cellular plastics in the slab 3, for example, whereby the movement of the pipe 2, resulting from expansion and contraction in response to temperature changes on regulation of the heat supply, can be taken up without disturbing noise oocurring. To advantage, the bottoms of the recesses 5 can therefore also be clad with foil sinoe the heads 6 must be able to glide in all directions in the bottom plane. Por a possible leakage in a pipe 2, the foil 12 also serves to lead leaking heating medium out to the recesses 5, in which moisture detectors not shown, see the SwedishPatent speoifioation 7602561 8 are adapted as leak indicators. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate how the separate slabs 10 for the recesses 5 can be suitably formed for joining to the other slabs 3, a nailing batton 14 let into the slab 10 together with a tongue 24 of the slab 10 extends in under a tongue 25 of the slab 3, so that the nailing battons 9 and 14 are situated opposite each other and oan take up through going nails 26 for mutual fixation of the slabs. Batons 15 oriented along the wall are arranged in the slabs 10 for removable attachment of the boards or panels 8 Figure 4 , e.g. by means of screws. The separate slabs 10 are composed of a bottom slab 17 with nailing batton 14, and on this slab there are ranged rows of blocks 27 along the edges of the slab.The battons 15 and similar battons for possible attachment of an extra board 16, are arranged in the block 27 In Pigures 2 4 it is shown how this extra board 16 is arranged recessed as reinforcement to carry boards which oould have a length joint not shown situated above the recess 5. Both rows of blocks 27 are arranged with spacing which, with reference to the inner row, affords space for the passage of the pipes 2 into the recess 5. The outer row has corresponding spacing, which thereby serves as passages for airing the spaces 11, 4 and 5 in the sub floor via a gap 28 between the wall of the room and the slab 16, floor panel 8 a carpet 18 and skirting board 22 see also Pigures 3 and 4 . Moisture variations, e.g. as a result of temperature changes, are smoothed out by the airing. Figure 4 furthermore illustrates how a floor panel forms the upwardly swingable hatch 8 for exposing the recess 5, for a floor layer 1 comprising floor panel with said carpet 18 which is wall to wall glued totie panels. A strip 19 recessed in the floor panels runs under the carpet 18 over the joint between the panel forming the hatch ss and the adjaoent one of the other panels. The strip is screwed into te nailing battons 9 of the sub floor by means of screws 21, which have their heads situated under the oarpet. When required, the hatch can be opened by removing the skirting board 22 some of the screws not shown in the vioinity of the wall and the screws 21 of the strip, the carpet then serving as a hinge, due to the action of the strip. Holes for the screws are made in the carpet.
