# A DEVICE FOR DETECTING THE PRESENCE OF NONCONDENSABLE GAS IN STEAM STERILIZERS

## Abstract
A device for indicating the presence of unacceptable le vels of noncondensable gas, such as air, in a steam steril ization chamber. The device 10 includes an insulated heat sink 12 having an upper end 14 and a lower end 16 . The upper end of the heat sink is in such open communication with the sterilization chamber that the steam enters the heat sink. The device also includes a chamber 34 proximate the lower end of the heat sink. The heat sink defines a path 18 through which the steam travels from the upper end toward the chamber. The path is adapted to provide sufficient expo sure of the steam to the heat sink so that the steam conden ses within the path, releasing any noncondensable gas as sociated with the steam and forcing it toward the chamber. The chamber includes means 40 for indicating the pres ence of noncondensable gas accumulated therein. The de vice also includes means such as the air in the chamber for preventing the condensate from affecting the indicating means.
