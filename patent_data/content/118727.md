# AMPLITUDE ADJUSTING EQUIPMENT IN A SIGNAL TRANSLATION LINE

## Abstract
An amplitude adjusting circuit used for a contrast adjusting circuit of resistor division type in which a video signal is applied across a pair of series connected resistors 23,251 and an output is produced from the junction point of the two resistors. At least one of the resistors is used as a variable resistor. The amplitude adjusting circuit comprises a current source for supplying a constant current steadily between the terminals of the variable resistor, a high gain amplifier 29 for controlling the resistance value of the variable resistor, and a filter 31, 33 for separating the video signal component from the change of the value of the variable resistor represented by a voltage change, and introducing the resistance change to the high gain differen tial amplifier.
