# Optical fibre reinstatement.

## Abstract
The primary coating 2 of an optical fibre element is reinstated over a fused joint between two silica fibre ele ments 3 by a casting process. The jointed silica fibre ele ments are arranged in a groove 8 of a mould 9, 10, 11 and liquid uncured primary coating material placed into the groove, the groove ends being blocked by the existing pri mary coatings 2 on the fibre elements 3 . The coating ma terial in the groove is cured by, for example, heating the mould. Secondary coating material 1 may be injection moulded using a two part mould to reinstate the secondary coating over the cast primary coating.
