# Angulating lateral fluoroscopic suspension.

## Abstract
Means for coupling an independently suspended medic al x ray source and detector for lateral fluorograpriic studies such as angiography. When coupled, the x ray source and detector move vertically in opposite directions, move hori zontally toward or away from each other, and pivot about horizontal axes so the distances between the focal spot and isocenter of examination and between the isocenter and image each remain constant, and so the central ray of the source coincides with the central ray of the detector. The bridge also rotates to rotate the entire assembly about a vertical axis passing through the isocenter. The x ray source and detector are independently hung from the ceiling to support them directly above their centers of weight, eliminating the bending moments and oscillation which are inherent features of prior C arm structures.
