# Wedge type fastener.

## Abstract
A wedge type fastener 10 which is economical to man ufacture and can be installed using known installation tools, such as those used in Europe. The fastener 10 comprises a main body portion 11 having an exterior adapted to be grasped by a tool to hold the same and an insert mounted in its interior keyed to the interior of the main body portion for rotation therewith. A threaded stud having a head keyed to the interior of the insert is also mounted within the body portion 11 having a threaded portion 47 extending out of one end of the body portion 11 . The body portion 11 is closed off at one end by a snap in cap 14 which also aligns the threaded stud in the body portion 11 and abuts against the insert. The threaded portion 47 of the stud extends through the cap 14 and terminates in a snap on cap 16 that keeps a threaded nut 15 threaded on the threaded por tion 47 of the stud between the first cap 14 and the second cap 16 from running off the stud. The stud, at its other end, includes a pair of wire elements 18, 19 fixedly secured therein. The wire elements 18, 19 extend out of an opening in the insert and out of the main body portion 11 and a spreader 17 , trapped within the body portions, is retained between the wires 18, 19 and held within the body portion 11 . When the body portion 11 is held by a tool and the nut 15 is rotated and abuts against the first cap 14 , the body portion 11 , insert, and spreader 17 do not rotate while the stud extends out of the body portion 11 pulling the wire elements 18, 19 within the body portion 11 with the spacer 17 forcing the elements 18, 19 away from each other to thereby clamp surfaces on the blind or non acces sible side of the aperture in which the fastener 10 is inserted.
