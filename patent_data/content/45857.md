# Process control apparatus.

## Abstract
A process control apparatus capable of adjusting control constants of a process control operation which controls a controlled process. The process control apparatus includes an identification signal generator 20 for producing a maximum length sequence signal, an adder 18 for adding this maximum length sequence signal and a control signal and supplying it as an operation signal to a process 26 , an operation circuit 24, 30 for identifying the pulse transfer function of a process in response to the process signal and the operation signal and processing the transfer function by Laplace transforming the step response of the pulse transfer function, and a circuit 32 for processing control constants according to the transfer function.
