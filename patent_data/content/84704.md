# ANGULAR RATE SENSOR APPARATUS

## Abstract
An angular rate sensor structure displaying high im munity to noise and feedback vibration is disclosed. Mount ing means 15, 31A supports by one end each of a pair of vibratory elements 10, 30 in symmetrical alignment about a nodal axis 20 . The vibratory elements 10, 30 are driven in a first mode of movement, in direct opposition to one another about the nodal axis 20 . Sensing means detect movement of the vibratory elements 10, 30 in directions other than in the first mode of movement resulting from application of external angular rate forces applied to the vibratory elements 10, 30 . In one illustrated embodiment the vibratory elements 10 each comprise a pair of rectan gular piezoelectric bender crystals 10A, 10B joined end to end but rotated 90 from one another, whilst in another embodiment the vibratory elements 30A, 30B are driven electromagnetically in the first mode of movement, and their vibration in other directions is sensed by electromagnetic sensing means 38, 39 .
