## Description
ANALGESIC PROCESS AND COtSOSITION This invention relates to a process and a composition for the management of pain by the administration of narcotic analgesics. Narcotic analgesics have been used for the relief of moderate to severe pain. Severe pain, particularly, has required the use of narcotic analgesics in large and increasing dosage amounts. A disadvantage of the narcotic analgesics is the development of dependence or addiction and tolerance to their action. Further, adverse reactions, including respiratory and circulatory depression, are observed when large doses are used. Ibuprofen and flurbiprof en are non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. They have been used in rheumatic and degenerative diseases of the joints, for reducing platelet adhesiveness, and for dental pain. It has now been found that, when separately or simultaneously administered to a subject,a narcotic analgesic and ibuprofen or flurbiprofen, or a salt or ester thereof, can act synergically in the management of severe to moderate pain. Narcotic analgesics are, in general, well known.Suitable such compounds for use in the present invention are the naturally occurring opium alkaloids and their semi synthetic and synthetic derivatives. Examples are morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, levorphanol, methadone, meperidine, anileridine, alphaprodine, fentanol, codeine, codone, and oxycodone. The narcotic analgesics are used together with ibuprofen p isobutylhydratopic acid or flurbiprofen 3 fluoro 4 phenylhydratropic acid or a pharmacologically acceptable salt or ester thereof. Suitable salts are the alkali metal, alkaline earth and ammonium salts. Suitable esters are the C1 8 alkyl esters, including the isomeric forms thereof. It can be that utilisation of the in vention results in better control of pain while delaying or eliminating narcotic dependance and resistance. The dosage amount initially is the usual dosage amount for the narcotic analgesic and about 50 mg of ibuprofen four or five times a day. After two days of administering the combination, the dose amount of narcotic analgesic is gradually lowered over a period of fourteen days to the lowest acceptable amount of narcotic to maintain analgesia from the combination. After fourteen days when the lowest narcotic amount is determined, the amount of ibuprofen is lowered to 100 200 mg day to maintain the same control of pain. For flurbiprofen the dosage amount initially is the usual dosage amount for the narcotic analgesic and about 50 mg of flurbiprofen four or five times a day. After two days of administering the combination, the dose amount of narcotic analgesic is gradually lowered over a period of fourteen days to the lowest acceptable amount of narcotic to maintain analgesia from the combination. After fourteen days when the lowest narcotic amount is determined, the amount of flurbiprofen is lowered to 100 200 mg day to maintain the same control of pain. The narcotic analgesic and ibuprofen or flurbiprofen can be administered in the same dosage unit or can be prepared in separate dosage units and the dosage units administered at the same time. Different forms of dosage units can be used, i.e., a tablet of ibuprofen or flurbiprofen and an injection of narcotic. The compositions of the present invention are preferably presented for systemic administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, suppositories, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, sterile nonparenteral solutions or suspensions, and oral solutions or suspensions and the like, containing suitable quantities of the synergistic combination of active ingredients. For oral administration either solid or fluid unit dosage forms can be prepared. Powders are prepared quite simply by comminuting the active ingredients to a suitably fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted diluent. The diluent can be an edible carbohydrate material such as lactose or starch. Advantageously, a sweetening agent or sugar is present as well as a flavoring oil. Capsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture and filling into formed gelatin sheaths. Advantageously, as an adjuvant to the filling operation, lubricant such as talc magnesium stearate, calcium stearate and the like is added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry of active ingredients with an acceptable vegetable oil, light liquid petrolatum or other inert oil or triglyceride. Tablets are made by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and pressing into tablets. The powder mixture is prepared by mixing the active ingredients, suitably comminutd, with a diluent or base such as starch lactose, kaolin, dicalcium phosphate and the like. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as corn syrup, gelating solution, methylcellulose solution or acacia mucilage and forcing through a screen.As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be slugged, i.e., run through the tablet machine and the resulting imperfectly formed tablets broken into pieces slugs . The slugs can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. Advantageously, the tablet can be provided with a protective coating consisting of a sealing coat or enteric coat of shellac, a coating of sugar and methylcellulose and a polish coating of carnauba wax. Fluid unit dosage forms for oral administration such as syrups, elixirs and suspensions can be prepared wherein each teaspoonful of composition contains a predetermined amount of the active ingredients for administration. The water soluble forms can be dissolved in an aqueous vehicle together with sugar, flavoring agents and preservatives to form a syrup. An elixir is prepared by using a hydroalcoholic vehicle with suitable sweeteners together with a flavoring agent. Suspensions can be prepared of the insoluble forms with a suitable vehicle with the aid of a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, methylcellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the active ingredients and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The active ingredients, depending on the form and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the ve hide. In preparing soluLion35 the water soluble active ingredients can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Cosolvents such as ethanol or propylene glycol can be used in the solvent system.Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the active ingredients are suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The active ingredients can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the active ingredients. In addition to oral and parenteral administration, the rectal and vaginal routes can be utilized. Active ingredients can be administered by means of a suppository. A vehicle which has a melting point at about body temperature or one that is readily soluble can be utilized. For example, cocoa butter and various polyethylene glycols carbowaxes can serve as the vehicle. The term unit dosage form as used in the specification and claims refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specification for the novel unit dosage forms of this invention are dictated by and are directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitation inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for therapeutic use in humans, as disclosed in this specification, these being features of the present invention. Examples of suitable unit dosages forms in accord with this invention are tablets, capsules, troches, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, cachets, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls, dropperfuls, ampules, vials, segregated multiples of any of the foregoing and other forms as herein described.
