# An improved method for preparing ABS type resin.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved process for prepar ing ABS resins wherein an alkadiene rubber is grafted in aqueous emulsion with styrene and nitrile type monomers, forming a grafted rubber, extracting said grafted rubber into a monomer phase and separating said monomer grafted rub bar phase from said aqueous phase followed by mass polymerizing said grafted rubber monomer phase to form an ABS polyblend, wherein the improvement comprises, carry ing out the mass polymerization of said monomers in the presence of sufficient carbon dioxide to provide an ABS resin having a substantially white color.
