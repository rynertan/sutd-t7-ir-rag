## Description
Friction pad assembly for disc brakesThe present invention relates to a friction pad assembly for vehicle disc brakes, of the type comprising a backing plate with a central tab on its upper edge, a pad of friction material fixed to the backing plate, and hold down spring means formed from wire and supported by the backing plate in correspondence with the central tab, the spring means including two sprung arms extending outwardly from an attachment part for releasably connecting the spring means to the backing plate in correspondence with the central tab.The term hold down spring is intended to mean a spring arranged to bias the backing plate against the guides with which the disc brake is provided so that the pad can slide towards and away from the disc during use of the vehicle. Since there is normally a clearance between the guides and the pad, the purpose of the spring is to avoid rattling of the pad relative to the guides and the noise resulting from such rattling.The object of the present invention is to provide a friction pad assembly of the type specified above, in which the spring means are simple and cheap to manufacture, easy to fit to and dismantle from the backing plate, occupy a small space, and are firmly connected to the backing plate when assembled.In order to achieve this object, the present invention provides a friction pad assembly for disc brakes of the type specified above, the main characteristic of which lies in the fact that the attachment part of the spring means has an open configuration and partially surrounds the backing plate with a form coupling such as to prevent relative movements between the attachment part and the backing plate in use.In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the spring means are constituted by a spring in which the two sprung arms are partly adjacent a first main face of the central tab of the backing plate and extend upwardly in a V shape from the ends of a substantially C shaped attachment part which partially surrounds the base of the central tab and lies in a plane substantially perpendicular to the backing plate, the portion of the attachment part which is adjacent the second main face of the central tab having a non rectilinear configurationFurther characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description which follows with reference to the appended drawings, provided purely by way of non limiting example, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a friction pad assembly for a disc brake of a motor vehicle, including a biasing spring according to a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the spring used in the pad of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view of the opposite side of the friction pad assembly illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a perspective view of a variant of Figure 1, without the biasing spring Figure 5 is a partial section taken on the lineV V of Figure 4, Figure 6 is a perspective view of a variant ofFigure 1, Figure 7 is a perspective view of a variant ofFigure 6, Figure 8 illustrates a further variant in which two biasing springs are used, Figure 9 is a variant of Figure 8, Figure 10 is a further variant of Figure 8, Figure 11 is a partial section taken on the lineXI XI of Figure 10, Figure 12 illustrates a perspective view of a further variant of Figure 1, Figure 13 is a variant of Figure 12, Figure 14 is a further variant of Figure 12, Figure 15 is a section taken on the line XV XV ofFigure 14, Figure 16 is a perspective view of a further variant of Figure 1, and Figure 17 is an exploded perspective view of Figure 16.In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 to 3, a friction pad assembly for disc brakes comprises a metal backing plate having a central tab 2 and a pad 3 of friction material fixed to one of the faces of the plate 1.The plate 1 has lateral shoulders la which, when the friction pad is fitted to a sliding caliper disc brake, are supported on guides so that the pad can slide towards and away from the disc. The pad has a hold down spring which biases the shoulders la against the guides to prevent rattling of the pad during use of the brake and the noise resulting from this rattling.The hold down spring is formed from wire and comprises two sprung arms 4 which are partly adjacent the face 2a of the tab 2 facing the friction pad 3 and extend upwardly in a V shape from a substantially C shaped attachment part 5, 6, 7, 8 which partially surrounds the base of the tab 2 and lies in a plane substantially perpendicular to the backing plate 1.The attachment part comprises two substantially U shaped facing parts comprising a horizontal portion 5 adjacent the face 2a, a lateral portion 6, a substantially horizontal portion 7 adjacent the opposite face 2b of the tab 2, and a non rectilinear connecting part 8 joining the ends of the two U shaped parts opposite the sprung arms 4 and adjacent the face 2b.Preferably, as illustrated in the drawings, the connecting part 8 is V shaped with its vertex uppermost.The spring described above may be easily fitted to and removed from the backing plate, occupies a very small space and, by virtue of the particular above described form coupling with the backing plate, cannot, in its assembled position, move relative to the backing plate except for deformations due to flexing of the sprung arms 4.Preferably, as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, the rear face 2b of the central tab 2 has a shaped groove 10 with the same profile as the two portions 7 and the connecting part 8.The groove 10 serves to house the parts 7 and 8 of the spring illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 so that these parts do not project from the surface of the backing plate on which the piston of the hydraulic operating cylinder of the pad acts in use.Preferably, the groove 10 is formed by coining.In the variant illustrated in Figure 6, the two inclined arms 4 are interconnected at their upper ends by a substantially horizontal portion 11, and the ends of the two U shaped portions 5, 6, 7 opposite the arms 4 are not connected together as in the preceding example but each have an end portion 12 which is inclined upwardly. The spring illustrated in Figure 7 is similar to that illustrated in Figure 6 except that the two inclined arms 4 are crossed to form an X shape and are connected directly to the lateral portions 6 which, in their turn, are connected directly to the upwardly inclined portions 12.In the embodiments illustrated in Figures 8 to 11, the hold down spring means are constituted by two springs instead of a single spring as in the previous examples.In Figure 8, each spring comprises an inclined arm 4 connected to a straight horizontal portion 5 which is connected, in turn, to a lateral portion 6a shorter than the thickness of the tab 2. The free end of the portion 6a is bent at 90 , as shown at 13, and engages a horizontal hole in the tab 2The two springs illustrated in Figure 9 differ from those illustrated in Figure 8 in that the final portion 13a of each spring is engaged in a vertical hole in the upper edge of the plate 1 adjacent the base of the tab 2.In the two springs illustrated in Figures 10 and 11, the inclined arms 4 are crossed and the arm of each spring is connected to a U shaped part 5a, 6, 12 by a curved part 14. The two curved parts 14 partially surround a pin 15 forming part of a bolt or rivet fixed to the tab 2, and are retained by a head 16 of the pin 15.The variant illustrated in Figure 12 uses a biasing spring which is similar to that illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 but is mounted upside down and has the bent ends 4a of its arms 4 perpendicular to the plane of the plate 1 and bearing slidably on the upper edge of the plate 1.In this case, as the spring flexes, the portions 4a slide on the edge of the plate I and the contact between the spring and the brake caliper occurs without relative sliding.In order to achieve centering and restraining of the spring in the example illustrated in Figure 13, the tab 2 has a pin similar to the pin 15 shown in Figures 10 and 11, this pin having a head 16 for retaining theV shaped part of the spring.Instead of the pin, the tab 2 could have a projection or rib integral with the tab itself. The variant illustrated in Figures 14 and 15 differs from that illustrated in Figures 12 and 13 in that the centering and positioning of the spring on the friction pad is effected by the bending of the top of the part 8 inwardly into a V shape to form a semi circular portion 17 which engages a vertical groove 18 formed by coining in the face 2b of the tab 2.The opposite face 2a of the tab 2 could have a rib formed simultaneously with the coining of the groove 18.This rib, extending between the inclined arms 4, could be used to make the centering of the spring still more effective.Clearly, the part 8 could have a profile different from the V shape illustrated in the drawings as long as it were able to fulfil the same function. Figures 16 and 17 illustrate a variant in which a spring of the type illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 has its lateral portions 5 housed in two transverse grooves 19 formed in the upper edge of the metal backing plate on the two sides of a tab 2a having a central recess 20 and a height less than that of the tab 2 shown in the preceding Figures.The groove 13 serves for the restraining, centering and secure positioning of the spring.In this case, the spring may be mounted with theV shaped part 8 located on the side with the friction pad or on the opposite side.The face of the metal plate 1 opposite the friction pad 3 may be coined to accommodate the parts of the spring adjacent this face, in order to reduce the projection of the spring and ensure the precise assembly of the spring.
