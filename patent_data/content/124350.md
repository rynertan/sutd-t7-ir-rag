# MONITORING DEFLOCCULATED PARTICLES IN A SUSPENSION

## Abstract
A method of monitoring the deflocculation of particles in a suspension, which particles, when deflocculated, are such that they can become aligned in an applifed field, comprises ap plying a beam of radiation of a region of the suspension, apply ing a field to the region and detecting a change, if any, in radia tion scattering properties of said region due to the aligning of deflocculated particles if any, of the suspension in the field.
