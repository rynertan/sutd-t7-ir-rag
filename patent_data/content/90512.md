# Process for treatment of oxide films prior to chemical cleaning.

## Abstract
A method for an oxidizing pretreatment of chromium III oxide containing films, resulting from corrosion of base metal surfaces of piping systems and the like, to render the corrosion films more amenable to conventional chemical cleaning treatments. The method uses a dilute aqueous solution of an iron VI salt FeO₄² .
