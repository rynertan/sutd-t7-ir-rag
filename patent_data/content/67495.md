# Method for the containment of nuclear waste.

## Abstract
Method of containing nuclear waste. A composition is first prepared of from 25 to 80 , calculated as SiOâ‚‚, of a partially hydrolyzed silicon compound, up to 30 , calculated as metal oxide, of a partially hydrolyzed aluminum or calcium compound, from 5 to 20 , calculated as metal oxide, of a partially hydrolyzed boron or calcium compound, from 3 to 25 , calculated as metal oxide, of a partially hydrolyzed sodium, potassium or lithium compound, an alcohol in a weight ratio to hydrolyzed alkoxide of 1.5 to 3 and sufficient water to remove at least 99 of the alcohol as an azeotrope. The azeotrope is boiled off and up to 40 , based on solids in the product, of the nuclear waste, is mixed into the composition. The mixture is evaporated to from 25 to 45 solids and is melted and cooled.
