# SERIAL DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A serial data communication system comprises digital send receive logic 103 and analog send receive circuitry 104. Data is transmitted over a bus 105, encoded as no pulse for a ONE, alternate positive and negative pulses for succes sive ZERO s. For transmitting, circuitry 103 includes a tim ing flip flop which produces a ³ ⁴ bit period STROBE signal for each ZERO, and a toggle flip flop for pulse polarity. For receiving, incoming positive and negative pulses drive sepa rate digital differentiators. A synchronizing counter is con trolled to include an extra tick or omit a tick from a normal 16 tick bit period appropriately. A further counter detects a string of at elast 8 ONE s, representing the end of transmis sion, the data being pre coded to ensure that such a string of ONE s cannot occur in true transmission of information.
