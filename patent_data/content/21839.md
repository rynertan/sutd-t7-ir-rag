# SPROCKET FOR MULTI STAGE CYCLE SPROCKET ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
This invention relates to a sprocket for a multistage sprocket assembly for use in a speed changing device for a cycle by means of which device a drive chain 3 is switched from one said sprocket A to another B , said sprocket comprising a sprocket body 1 having a circumferentially extending plurality of peripherally disposed sprocket teeth 11 each said tooth 11 tapering from its base towards its tip 11a . In order to reduce interference between the drive chain 3 and the sprocket teeth 11 during gear changing at least one said tooth 11 has a chamfer 12 at the corner between the top radially outer edge 11e of the tooth 11 and the front edge 11c thereof with respect to the forward direction of rotation of the sprocket, said chamfer 12 extending from the top edge 11e at or in proximity to a longitudinally intermediate point of the tooth 11 .
