# LASER DEVICE AND METHOD FOR A SELF ALIGNED MULTILAYER EPITAXY STRUCTURE DEVICE

## Abstract
A method of forming the proper metallization contacts in a multilayer epitaxy laser device is provided. By selecting the proper crystal plane orientation in etching nonplanar fea tures like channels 7,7 for the device, a differential etch rate in a free etch can be effected to remove only selected portions of the top layer 9 and to provide self alignment in the metallization process.
