# Mounting arrangement for powered equipment used with a tractor and trailer.

## Abstract
Powered equipment 76 e.g. a vacuum device for transferring grass cuttings from a tractor mounted mower to a towed trailer is mounted on a platform 70 which is, in turn, mounted on a frame 42 . A rear part 43 of the frame is clamped onto the trailer tongue 37 by plates 44, 45 and bolts 46 . A front part 51 of the frame has a forward socket 60 for attachment to the hitch ball of the tractor. In order to provide good steering of the trailer the front and rear parts of the frame are connected by an articulated joint 50, 56 while a link extends from a universal joint on the front part 50 to a universal joint on the tractor spaced laterally from the hitch ball so as to allow pitching and rolling substantially without any yaw. The frame may have retractable wheels or a removable dolly to enable one person handling of the frame carrying the powered equipment when it is being attached and detached.
