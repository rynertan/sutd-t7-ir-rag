# Improved process for producing ethylene glycol.

## Abstract
In the preparation of ethylene glycol by reacting metha nol, formaldehyde and an organic peroxide, improved yields of ethylene glycol are achieved by the reaction of portions of the total amounts of formaldehyde and peroxide to be reacted with methanol. Formaldehyde and peroxide are incrementally added to a liquid medium containing metha nol in controlled amounts during the reaction to permit conversion of each portion of said formaldehyde and peroxide reactants prior to the next addition. The portions are added such that the concentration of glycol in the reaction medium to which a later portion is added is greater than that to which an earlier portion is added. The reaction is continued until all the formaldehyde and peroxide has been incrementally added to the reaction medium and subjected to reaction conditions for a suitable period of time.
