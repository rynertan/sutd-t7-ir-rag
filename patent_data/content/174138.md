# ELECTRICAL POWER ASSISTED STEERING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An electrical power assisted steering system for a vehicle. The system includes a battery 20 , having two terminals at different voltages and a center tap, and a bidirectional electric power assist motor 10 having two terminals, one terminal being connected to the centre tap of the battery. In an electric vehicle, said battery would be the traction battery. A control circuit 28 responds to movement of the vehicle s steering wheel 12 to generate a pulse width modulated PWM signal to drive the motor 10 to assist in steering. The pulse widths are directly proportional to the driver s rotational displacement of the steering wheel and the amount of current flowing through the motor and inversely proportional to the speed of the vehicle. The PWM signal is applied to a selected one of two driving transistors 24,26 , the first of which is connected between one of the terminals of the battery 20 and the free terminal of the motor 10 , the other of which is connected between the other terminal of the battery 20 and the free terminal of the motor 16 . Upon receipt of the PWM signal, the selected driving transistor 24,26 connects the motor 10 to its associated terminal of the battery 20 to cause the motor to turn in a desired direction and deliver torque proportional to the width of the pulses. Also disclosed are monitoring circuits 74 82 which monitor the operation of the control circuit 28 and discon nect the motor 10 from the battery 20 when a malfunction is detected.
