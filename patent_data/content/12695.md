# Composition and method for sealing phosphatized metal components.

## Abstract
Composition for sealing phosphatized metal compo nents to improve corrosion resistance and paint adhesion, which consists essentially of a from 5 to 80 weight percent phosphoric acid b from 1 to 16 weight percent of an acidsolubie zinc compound c from 0.1 to 10 weight percent of a heavy metal accele rator and or crystal refiner d from 1 to 80 weight percent of a phosphonate corro sion inhibitor and e sufficient water to dilute the composition to its desired strength.
