# Laundering process for dual bleaching stained fabrics.

## Abstract
Stained textile fabrics, especially cotton polyester, rayon polyester blends stained in use with blood stains, can be reclaimed and returned to use by the process of washing and bleaching said fabrics in the presence of a non ionic and anionic surface active agent, together with an oxygen releasing bleaching agent and a chlorine releasing bleaching agent, said bleaching agents used either successively or simultaneously. The laundering process involves the use of aqueous solutions of bleaching agents at elevated temperatures and at a high pH. The process of the invention provides a synergistic improvement in the removal of stains as compared with the use of either an oxygen releasing bleaching agent or a chlorine releasing bleaching agent. The process can include a hot aqueous acid sour treatment to remove rust stains and an aqueous sour to neutralize alkalies in the bleached fabric. The treatment can be completed in a period of time of about 30 to about 90 minutes.
