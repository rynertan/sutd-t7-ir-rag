# Organosilicon compounds, their preparation and anti tumor agents containing the same.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel anti tumor agent highly effective for inhibiting growth of several tumor or cancer cells with low toxicity. The active ingredient contained in the anti tumor agent is an ω triorganosilyl substituted linear alkanoic acid anilide which is a hitherto unknown novel compound prepared by the reaction of corresponding acid chloride and aniline. The compound has the general formula R₃Si CH₂ C₆H₅ where R is a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydro carbon group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and n is an in teger from 1 to 5.
