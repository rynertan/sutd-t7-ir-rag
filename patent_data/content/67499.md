# Process for producing alpha amino acids.

## Abstract
A process for producing efficiently and economically without using strong acids nor strong bases, α amino acids from α amino acid amides by hydrolyzing α amino acid amides in an aqueous medium in the presence of ammonia. If necessary, the resultant hydrolyzate liquid from which α amino acid has been removed may be reused.
