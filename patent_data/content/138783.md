# LARGE PORE CATALYSTS FOR HEAVY HYDROCARBON CONVERSION

## Abstract
Disclosed is a catalyst, a method for its preparation. and a process for its use in the production of high octane gasoline and or other valuable liquid hydrocarbon products from car bo metallic oils contaminated with heavy metals and cocke precursors. The catalyst is prepared from a shapable com position containing reticulated carbon black particles which are subsequently removed by burning, as in a catalyst re generator, to provide large feeder pores in a shaped catalyst structure. The catalyst and process conditions for its use facilitate conversion of the contaminated oils to lighter products at catalytic sites within the catalyst structure which may contain zeolitic materials.
