# PROCESS FOR PREPARING N ACYLPHENYLALANINES.

## Abstract
A process for preparing N acylphenylalanines repre sented by formula II wherein R³ and R⁴ each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a phenoxy group, a hydroxy group or a methylenedioxy group, R represents a methyl group or a phenyl group, by catalytic reduction of an N acyl β phenylserine represented by formu la I wherein R¹ and R² each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a phenoxy group, a benzyloxy group or a methylenedioxy group, and R is as defined above, in a solvent in the presence of a reducing catalyst or both a reducing catalyst and an acid.
