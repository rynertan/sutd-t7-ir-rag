## Description
The present invention relates to plasmids and bacteria containing them and more particularly to plasmid vectors capable of replicating in In order to enhance productivity of fermentation products of Therefore, an object of the present invention is to produce recombinant plasmid vectors capable of replication in In order to solve the foregoing problem, the present inventors have produced plasmids which replicate in A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein In the present invention, marker genes present in the plasmids are derived from The gene which expresses trimethoprim resistance when introduced into Mutants having resistance to trimethoprim may readily be obtained, e.g. by exposing the parent strain to mutation inducing agents such as N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine, etc., followed by selecting strains that have acquired trimethoprim resistance from a culture medium containing trimethoprim. The strains which acquire trimethoprim resistance may be obtained by adding at least 100 µg ml, preferably over 200 µg ml, of trimethoprim to the culture medium. A typical medium, for example, is minimum medium, which contains 2 g dl of glucose, 1 g dl of ammonium sulfate, 0.25 g dl of urea, 0.1 g dl of KH₂PO₄, 0.04 g dl of MgSO₄.7H₂O, 2 ppm of ferric ions, 2 ppm of manganese ions, 200 µg l of thiamine hydrochloride, 50 µg l of biotin, and 1.5 g dl of agar and has been adjusted to a pH of 7.0. Resistant strains are readily obtained by selecting strains that grow on the medium. For separating the genes expressing trimethoprim resistance, chromosomal genes are first extracted for example, a method described in H. Saito and K. Miura, In addition to the above mentioned glutamic acid producing To obtain plasmids capable of replicating in As the wild type plasmids capable of replicating in The plasmids having replication region DNAs are typically cleaved with the same restriction enzyme used for cleaving the chromosomal genes in order to produce plasmid terminals capable of ligating with the DNA that encodes trimethoprim resistance. The chromosomal DNA cleaved fragments and cleaved plasmid DNAs are subjected to a ligation reaction as they are or, if necessary, after connecting them with an oligonucleotide having complementary base sequences at each of the terminals. To introduce the thus obtained recombinant DNA comprising the chromosomal DNA and the plasmid DNA into recipient bacteria of the In the protoplast technique, sufficiently high frequency can be obtained even by the above described process used for After transformation, strains having acquired trimethoprim resistance are separated as the desired transformants. Such transformants contain recombinant DNA having incorporated therein genes expressing trimethoprim resistance. To isolate the recombinant DNA, the transformants are lysed, for example by a treatment with lysozyme and SDS, and then treated with phenol. Two volumes of ethanol are then added thereto to precipitate and recover the recombinant DNA. The thus obtained plasmids capable of replicating in The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified. After DNAs, 5 µg, of pAJ 228 prepared in Example 1 were treated with restriction endonuclease Hae II 5 units at 30 C for 30 minutes to partially cleave them. Thereafter, the same procedure as in Example 1 was repeated to perform a ligation reaction of DNA strands with DNA ligase derived from T₄ phage. After completion of the reaction, heat treatment was carried out at 65 C for 10 minutes. After the addition of a 2 fold amount of ethanol, the precipitated and collected DNAs were subjected to protoplast transformation in a manner similar to Example 1, using as the recipient cell Plasmid pAJ 228 carries the cleavage sites for restriction enzymes as shown in Table 1, but as the site for one cleavage, Cla I, Hpa I, Sma I, Xba I, Xho I and Xma I alone are known. On the other hand, in plasmid vectors capable of replicating in DNAs, 0.1 µg, of pAJ 228 were treated with restriction endonuclease Hpa I at 37 C for 2 hours. After completely cleaving them, heat treatment was carried out at 65 C for 10 minutes. To the reaction solution, 100 pmole of Pst I linker d pG C T G C A G C manufactured by Takara Brewery Co., Ltd., whereby a ligation reaction of DNA strands was carried out with T₄ phage derived DNA ligase at 10 C for 24 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol. After heat treatment at 65 C for 5 minutes, a 2 fold amount of ethanol was added to the reaction solution to precipitate and harvest DNAs after completion of the ligation reaction. The thus obtained DNAs were introduced into When genetic DNA is incorporated into a plasmid vector and a promoter in charge of expression of the gene is present on the incorporated genetic DNA, genetic expression is achieved by the action of the promoter. However, when no promoter is present on the incorporated genetic DNA, it is necessary to express the gene utilizing a promoter in the vector. Accordingly, vectors in which a cleavage site for insertion of genetic DNA with a restriction enzyme is positioned downstream of the promoter region possessed by the vectors are extremely useful as vectors for expression. Plasmid vectors pAJ 228, pAJ 225 and pAJ 226 shown in Examples 1, 3 and 4 had poor utility as expression vectors since the cleavage site for insertion of genetic DNAs with restriction enzyme was not always located downstream of the promoter region. Thus, in this example, there is shown a method for forming expression vectors having the cleavage site wtih restriction enzyme located downstream from the promoter region present in pAJ 228. For detecting the promoter region in pAJ 228, it is convenient to use as a probe a DNA fragment that carries no promoter region and expresses in Next, a method for constructing an expression vector from pAJ 228 using this DNA fragment harboring HK genes will be stated below. An outline of the method is shown in Figure 4. At both terminals of a DNA fragment of 2.9 Kb cleaved out of pAJ 211 through partial cleavage with restriction enzyme Pst I, a synthetic oligonucleotide linker having cleavage sites of BamH I, Sal I and Pst I as shown in Figure 4 was ligated with DNA ligase derived from T₄ phage. Then cleavage was performed with restriction enzyme BamH I. The thus obtained DNA mixture was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to separate and extract a DNA fragment of about 2.9 Kb. By ethanol precipitation, the DNA fragment was recovered. The thus obtained DNA fragment has a structure in which the cleavage sites with Pst I, Sal I and BamH I were aligned at both terminals of DNAs containing the 2.9 Kb of HK genes Figure 4 . On the other hand, pAJ 228 was partially cleaved with restriction enzyme Mbo I followed by heat treatment at 65 C for 10 minutes. The DNA fragment containing HK genes obtained in the method described above was added to the resulting reaction solution to perform a ligation reaction of DNA strands with T₄ DNA ligase. After completion of the reaction, heat treatment was carried out at 65 C for 5 minutes. By the addition of a 2 fold amount of ethanol, precipitated and harvested DNAs were subjected to protoplast transformation in a manner similar to Example 1, using recipient The colonies were replicated in minimum medium containing 200 µg ml of trimethoprim but containing no threonine required by recipient to obtain 4 strains resistant to trimethoprim and having lost theonine auxotrophy. From these strains, lysates were prepared in a manner similar to Example 1. By detection of plasmid DNAs by agarose gel electrophoresiss, plasmids of 14.9 Kb, 12.2 Kb, 9.6 Kb and 6.5 Kb were detected. Of these, the plasmid having the smallest molecular weight was named pAJ 224 HK. AJ 12076 introduced with pAJ 244 HK showed very high activity of HK. Next, pAJ 224 HK was completely cleaved with restriction enzyme Pst I. Thereafter, a 3.6 Kb fragment which was believed to be miniaturized vector pAJ 228 was recovered from agarose electrophoresis gel. The fragment was subjected, in a manner similar to Example 1, to a ligation reaction of DNA strands with T₄ DNA ligase and protoplast transformation using as recipient Plasmid pAJ 224 has a function as expression vector. It can be confirmed, as stated above, from the fact that when a DNA fragment of HK genes carrying no promoter region is inserted at the cleavage site with restriction enzyme Pst I, threonine auxotrophy of HK deficient strain disappears. Further for the purpose of examining the intensity of its expression activity, the following experiment was carried out. As an index for the intensity of the expression activity, resistance to chloramphenicol, which expresses in Next, After pAJ 224 HK produced as in Example 5 was completely cleaved by restriction enzyme Sal I, a ligation reaction of DNA strands was carried out with T₄ DNA ligase. In a manner similar to Example 1, thermal denaturation and ethanol precipitation were carried out. The thus obtained DNAs were subjected to protoplast transformation using Each bacterium was inoculated on agar plate of complete medium containing chloramphenicol and cultured at 30 C for 24 hours.
