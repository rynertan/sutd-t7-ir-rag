## Description
This invention relates to certain substituted 4 hydroxy and 4 acyloxy 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 1,1 dioxides having at the 3 position a 2 substituted 1,3,4 oxadiazol 5 yl or a 2 substituted tetrazol 5 yl group which demonstrate selective 5 lipoxygenase 5 LO pathway inhibitory activity. Arachidonic acid is the biological precursor of a group of endogenous metabolites, the leukotrienes. Said metabolites arise via the action of arachidonate lipoxygenases and give rise to allergic reactions. 5 Lipoxygenase, for example, catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonic acid at C5. This is the first step in the biosynthesis of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A , a bronchoconstrictive agent believed to cause allergic asthma in man. Although discovery of the antiinflammatory activity of 1,2 benzothiazines has given rise to intensive investigation of said compounds, especially of the 1,1 dioxide derivatives thereof wherein the substituent at the 3 position is a substituted carboxamide, few people have synthesised 1,2 benzothiazines having a heterocyclic moiety at the 3 position. GB A 1492716 and GB A 1492718 disclose certain 1,2 benzothiazine 1,1 dioxides having a 2 1,2,4 oxadiazol 3 yl substituent, as anti inflammatory agents, however no one appears to have disclosed the use of 1,2 benzothiazines as inhibitors of 5 lipoxygenase. The 5 LO inhibiting activity of several structural types of compounds is reported in the literature The overall medical significance of the problems of bronchoconstriction and pulmonary diseases gives rise to the need for selective and efficient inhibitors of 5 LO in order to prevent, at least to minimise, the formation of SRS A in man and, as a consequence, to reduce allergic asthma reactions. The 5 LO inhibitors of this invention have formulae I and II wherein, in formula I, R¹ is alkyl having form 1 to 8 carbon atoms or CH₂ Preferred compounds of the invention are those of formula I wherein R¹ is alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or methoxyethoxymethyl Of particular interest because of their potent and selective 5 LO inhibiting activity are those compounds of formula I wherein R¹ is alkyl having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R² is benzoyl, cyclohexylcarbonyl or acetyl and R³ is alkyl having from 9 to 11 carbon atoms, phenyl, methoxyphenyl or tolyl and those compounds of formula II wherein R¹ is alkyl having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R⁴ is acetyl, and R⁵ is alkyl having from 8 to 10 carbon atoms, methoxybenzyl or methylbenzyl. Particularly preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein R¹ is ethyl R² is acetyl, cyclohexylcarbonyl, or benzoyl or R³ is alkyl having from 7 to 11 carbon atoms, phenyl or tolyl. Particularly preferred compounds of formula II are those wherein R¹ is ethyl R⁴ is acetyl and R⁵ is alkyl having from 8 to 10 carbon atoms or methylbenzyl. The compounds of this invention are prepared from N cyanomethylsaccharin 2 cyanomethyl 1,2 benzisothiazol 3 2H one 1,1 dioxide by the abbreviated reaction sequence presented below In the first step, N cyanomethylsaccharin III is converted to o carboalkoxy N cyanomethylbenzenesulfonamide IV by cleavage of the cyclic imide by reaction with an alkali metal alkoxide of 1 4 carbon atoms in a C The product IV is isolated by neutralization of the reaction mixture, desirably below room temperature, e.g. from 10 15 C, and the precipitated solid recovered. The second step involves alkylation of the sulfonamide moiety of IV with the appropriate halide, R¹ X, wherein X is iodo, chloro or bromo in the presence of an acid acceptor and in a reaction inert solvent. The reactants are generally reacted together in stoichiometric or approximately stoichiometric amounts at a temperature of from 25 to 5 C. Suitable reaction inert solvents i.e., those which do not react to any degree with the reactants and or products in such a manner as to significantly reduce the yield of a given reaction. Representative of such solvents are acetone, water, N,N dimethylformamide, methylene chloride, chloroform and mixtures thereof. The choice of acid acceptor is somewhat dependent upon the solvent system used. It is desirable, in order to achieve optimum removal of by product from the reaction, to use an acid acceptor which is soluble in the solvent system used. However, acid acceptors which are insoluble in the solvent can also be used. Aqueous systems are the more versatile systems in that both inorganic and organic acid acceptors can be used. When using a non aqueous solvent system, tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N methylmorpholine, N ethylpiperidine and N,N dimethylaniline are suitable acid acceptors. Aqueous systems permit use of the aforementioned bases and also of inorganic bases such as alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates. Inorganic bases can, of course be used in non aqueous solvents. For example, the inorganic bases enumerated above can be used as acid acceptors in N,N dimethylformamide as those skilled in the art will recognize. The compounds of formula IV and N substituted derivatives of formula IV compounds can, if desired, be isolated by known procedures, or they can be converted to the cyclic compound of formula V . It is generally preferred to at least obtain the formula IV compound in concentrated form before cyclizing it to a formula V compound. The cyclization of formula IV compounds, N unsubstituted or N substituted derivatives thereof , is readily accomplished by means of alkali metal C Conversion of formula V compounds to the tetrazol 5 yl derivatives of formula VI is accomplished by reaction of the cyano derivative, formula V , with azide ion in the presence of an acid addition salt of ammonia or of amines and in a reaction inert solvent. The azide ion can be derived from a variety of sources. The only criterion appears to be that the particular source chosen be capable of releasing azide ion under the conditions i.e., solvent, temperature, of a given reaction. Suitable sources of azide ions are inorganic and organic azides. In the case of organic azides, the organic moiety must be strongly electron withdrawing in nature. Representative sources of azide ions are metal azides, especially alkali metal azides, trialkylsilyl azides having from one to four carbon atoms in each of the alkyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl azide and triethylsilyl azide, tetra n butylammonium azide, tetramethylguanidinium azide, hydrazoic acid, ammonium azide, trifluoromethylazide, N,N dimethylanilinium azide, N methyl morpholinium azide and triethylammonium azide. The molar ratio of azide to cyano reactant of formula VI is generally held in the range of from 1 1 to 6 1. Higher ratios can be used but are generally accompanied by reduced yields of the desired tetrazole product. In practice, molar ratios of 2 1 have been found to afford high yields of the desired tetrazol 5 yl compounds of formula VI . The presence of from 1 to 5 moles of ammonium chloride or of acid addition salts of amines to azide reactant during the reaction is desirable. The acid addition salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines can be used. The nature of the acid portion of the acid addition salt is immaterial to the operability of this process. However, certain acid addition salts are favored over others for such reasons as availability, ease of preparation and solubility in the reaction mixture. The suitability of a given amine acid addition salt is easily determined by carrying out the process of this invention using the particular amine acid addition salt. Favored acid addition salts are the salts with mineral acids and organic acids such as alkane sulfonic acids such as methane and ethane sulfonic acids, p toluenesulfonic acid, benzene sulfonic acid, napthalenesulfonic acids, alkanoic acids such as acetic, n butyric, octanoic, benzoic and substituted benzoic acids and cation exchange resins. The preferred amine acid addition salts are the hydrochloride salts of tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tri n propylamine, tri n butylamine, trimethylamine, N,N dimethylaniline, N methylpiperidine and N methyl morpholine because of the satisfactory conversions of nitrile to tetrazole they afford in this process. Especially preferred is ammonium chloride. Suitable reaction inert solvents for this process are N,N dimethyl formamide DMF , halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethanes, chloroform, and methylene chloride, ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl and diethyl ethers of ethyleneglycol and diethylene glycol, macrocylcic polyethers crown compounds , benzene, xylene, tetralin and pyridine. DMF is a favored solvent in view of the favorable yields it affords and the ease of recovery of the tetrazolyl products therefrom. In order to expedite the reaction the solvent should desirably be one which completely dissolves all reactants. As one skilled in the art appreciates, complete solubility is, however, not necessary. Partial solubility of reactants in the solvent system is sufficient to permit reaction to occur at an acceptable rate. The reaction is generally conducted over the range of from 20 C to 110 C. The favored temperature range is from 25 C to 80 C and the preferred range from 40 C to 70 C. Temperature is not a critical factor and lower or higher temperatures can be employed. Lower temperatures, of course, require longer reaction times than do the higher temperatures. Temperatures above about 110 C. are usually avoided to minimize decomposition of reactants and products. The reaction period depends in part upon the reactants and the solvent system used. As a general rule, the reaction is completed in periods ranging from 2 to 24 hours. In the conversion of formula V to formula VI compounds, the use of an acid rather than acid addition salts of ammonia or of amines also affords satisfactory reaction. Acids such as those enumerated above under acid addition salts of amines are representative of suitable acids. The tetrazole compounds of formula VI are converted to oxadiazoles of formula I via the Huisgen reaction. This reaction comprises acylation of the tetrazole VI to produce a compound of formula II A or II . Said acylation is carried out under standard acylation conditions using the appropriate acid, acyl halide or acyl anhydride. Suitable solvents for the acylation reaction are aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene chlorinated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane and chloroform. When the acylating agent is a liquid, e.g. acetic anhydride, it is advantageously used in excess to serve both as reactant and solvent. When isolation of the acyl derivative is desired, the reaction is conducted at temperatures ranging from 5 25 C in order to avoid thermal fragmentation of the tetrazole derivative with loss of nitrogen and ultimate formation of a 1,3,4 oxadizole derivative. Acylation with the appropriate acyl halide is carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor such as pyridine, triethylamine, N methylmorpholine or N,N dimethylaniline, at temperatures of from 5 25 C, in a solvent such as those enumerated above. Alternatively, an excess of the acid acceptor, e.g. pyridine, can be used as solvent. Acylation with an acid is conducted in a solvent such as those enumerated above and in the presence of a dehydrative coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide according to known procedures. The acylation products are isolated, if desired, by conventional methods as by filtration or, if not solid forms, by concentration of the reaction mixture to an oil. In many instances the oily product obtained can be obtained as a solid, or as crystals, by addition of n hexane or other solvent. When an acyl halide is used as acylating agent in the presence of an excess of acid acceptor, the products are conveniently recovered by diluting the reaction mixture with aqueous acid, e.g. dilute hydrochloric acid, and removal of the solid product by filtration. When excess acid acceptor is not used, dilution of the reaction mixture with an organic solvent and extraction of the resulting solution with aqueous acid e.g. dilute HCl and water affords the acylated product. Mono or diacylated products are produced depending upon the stoichiometric ration of acylating agent to tetrazole reactant of formula VI . The use of up to one equivalent of acylating agent per mole of formula VI compound affords the monoacyl derivative as principal product. Greater amounts of acylating agent favor diacylation i.e., at the 4 hydroxy group and at the tetrazolyl group. The use of two or more equivalents, of course, favours diacylation. An alternative procedure for acylating formula VI compounds comprises reacting said compounds with the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a dehydrative coupling agent such as carbodiimide, ethoxyacetylene, alpha chlorovinyl ethyl ether, N,N carbonyldiimidazole, N hydroxysuccinimide and 2 ethyl 5 3 sulfophenyl 1,2 oxazole betaine. Preferred as coupling agent is dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Said dehydrative coupling agents when used to prepare acylated products of this invention are used according to standard procedures. For example, the formula VI compound and appropriate acid are reacted in a reaction inert solvent such as toluene or xylene, at the reflux temperature in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. To insure satisfactory yields excesses of carbodiimide and acid, based on the formula VI compound, are used. In practice mole ratios of formula VIII compound to acid to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide of 1 3 3 have been found satisfactory. The 4 acyl derivatives of compounds of formula I are readily converted to the corresponding 4 hydroxy derivatives by alkaline hydrolysis, especially by use of alkali metal alkoxides in an alkanol solvent corresponding to the alkanol from which the alkoxide is derived. The hydrolysis occurs at room temperature. The 4 hydroxy derivative is recovered by removal of the solvent and adjustment of the pH of an aqueous mixture of the residue to about 1.5. The 4 hydroxy formula I compounds thus obtained can then be reacylated with a different acylating agent, if desired. The reacylation is carried out according to the conditions described above. The isolated compounds of formula II are transformed to formula I compounds by heating to an elevated temperature, e.g. from 80 150 C, in a reaction inert solvent such as toluene, benzene, xylene, acyl anhydride excess . Lower temperatures require too large a heating period to be practical. Higher temperatures can, of course, be used but afford no advantage. The oxadizole compounds are recovered by concentration of the reaction mixture, cooling the concentrate to precipitate a solid which is filtered off. The acylation products of formula II need not be isolated prior to converting them to oxadiazoles of formula I . The conversion of formula VI to formula I compounds can be carried out Compounds of formula II wherein R⁵ is benzyl, methoxybenzyl or methylbenzyl are prepared from formula II compounds wherein R⁵ is H by reaction of said formula II compound with the appropriate aralkyl halide such as benzyl bromide, 2 methoxybenzyl chloride and 4 methylbenzyl chloride, in a reaction inert solvent in the presence of an acid acceptor. It is preferred to use an aralkyl bromide as reactant. When an aralkyl chloride is used as reactant, it is advantageous to add a small amount of alkali metal iodide as accelerator because of the relatively lower reactivity of aralkyl chlorides compared to aralkyl bromides. Suitable solvents are N,N dimethylformamide, N,N diethylformamide, N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide, toluene and xylene. The reaction is conducted at ambient temperature until complete or substantially complete. Potassium carbonate is favored as acid acceptor when N,N dimethylformamide is used as solvent. However, other acid acceptors, inorganic and organic in nature, such as sodium carbonate, alkali metal hydrides or alkoxides tertiary amines such as pyridine, triethylamine, N methylmorpholine can also be used. The products are isolated by known procedures as, for example, by dilution with water or dilute aqueous acid followed by filtration of the product. A mixture of the 2 aralkyl and 1 aralkyl isomers is generally obtained. The isomers are separated by taking advantage of their solubility differences. The 5 LO inhibiting activity of the compounds of this invention is tested by a cell culture assay which determines the effect of said compounds on the metabolism of arachidonic acid and, therefore, their ability to inhibit the activity of 5 LO. The procedure is described by Jakschick et al., Prostaglandins Because of their 5 LO inhibiting activity, the compounds of formulae I and II are effective agents for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of bronchoconstrictive and pulmonary diseases in man. When used for this purpose, said compounds are administered via the oral, parenteral or topical routes. The compounds may be administered The 5 LO inhibitor compounds of this invention may be administered in single or multiple doses. The particular route of administration and the dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician in keeping with the condition of the individual to be treated and said individual s response to the treatment. In general, for oral administration, doses of from 10 mg to 1000 mg per day in single or multiple doses are sufficient. For parenteral administration, doses of from 5 mg to 750 mg per day are used in single or multiple doses. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects to occur provided that such higher dose levels are first divided into several smaller doses that are to be administered throughout the day. For purposes of oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium sterate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules preferred materials in this connection would also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and combinations thereof. For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water soluble alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts previously enumerated. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. Additionally, it is also possible to administer the aforesaid compounds topically and this may be preferably done by way of creams, salves, jellies, pastes or ointments, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.

To a suspension of N cyanomethylsaccharin 276 g in methanol 1000 ml was added dropwise 28 sodium methoxide 145 ml over 30 minutes at 5 10 C. After stirring at 5 10 C. for 1 hour, 6N HCl ca. 230 ml was added dropwise maintaining the temperature at 10 15 C. The resulting crystals were collected by filtration, washed with water and dried To a mixture of o carbomethoxy N cyanomethylbenzenesulfonamide 116 g and sodium hydroxide 16.8 g in water 80 ml and acetone 400 ml was added methyliodide 28 ml at 20 25 C. After stirring for 3 hours at 20 C., the solvent was stripped off to give a viscous oil. Water 400 ml was added and the mixture extracted with dichloromethane. The resulting extract was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give the product as a viscous oil, 108.2 g 88 . To a solution of o carbomethoxy N cyanomethyl N methylbenzenesulfonamide 108 g in toluene 600 ml was added 28 sodium methoxide methanol solution 83 ml with vigorous stirring. After 2 hours the solvent was evaporated to ca. 400 ml and water 800 ml added to dissolve the viscous residue. The pH was adjusted to ca. 2 with 6N HCl. The resulting crystals were granulated for 1 hour, filtered off, washed with water and dried A mixture of o carbomethoxy N cyanomethylbenzene sulfonamide 6.25 g 0.025 moles , ethyl iodide 2 ml and potassium carbonate 1.73 g in dimethylformamide 30 ml was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours at at 50 C. for 2 hours. The resulting mixture was poured into water 50 ml and extracted with dichloromethane. The extract was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give an oil 6.69 g. The oil was dissolved in toluene 33 ml , then 28 sodium methoxide in methanol 4.6 ml was added. After being stirred at 20 C. for 16 hours, the mixture was concentrated to a viscous oil, to which was added water 50 ml and then 6N HCl to pH 2.0. The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with water and dried In like manner, but using n propyl iodide or isopropyl iodide in place of ethyl iodide, the corresponding 2 n propyl and 2 isopropyl compounds are prepared 3 cyano 2 isopropyl 4 hydroxy 1,2 benzothiazine 1,1 dioxide To a solution of o carbomethoxy N cyanomethylbenzenesulfonamide 6.25 g in dichloromethane 50 ml was added triethylamine 2.5 g and then beta methoxy ethoxymethyl chloride 3.12 g at 5 10 C. After being stirred for 1 hour at room temperature, the mixture was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. To the resulting oil was added toluene 33 ml and then 28 sodium methoxide in methanol 4.6 ml and stirring was continued for an additional 16 hours at room temperature. The mixture was extracted with water 50 ml and the aqueous layer was acidified to pH 2 with 6N HCl and extracted with dichloromethane. The resulting organic layer was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to a viscous oil, which was submitted to silica gel column chromatography SiO₂, 100 g and eluted with a mixed solvent CH₂Cl₂ CH₃OH 4 1 to give the title product as a viscous oil.
