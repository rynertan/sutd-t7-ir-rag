## Description
Transdermal drg delivery device and its preparation Different theoretical and technical approaches have been employed to develop pharmaceutical dosage forms for transdermal controlled administration of potent drugs for systemic therapeutic effects. Several transdermal delivery systems which have been developed include the use of rate controlling membranes U.S. Patent Nos. 3,996,939 and 4,031,894 a polymeric diffusion matrix European PatentApplication No. 13,606 and a gel diffusion matrix U.S.Patent No. 4,336,243 . The foregoing are approaches to controlled drug delivery that yield acceptably predictable drug availability for relatively long duration, i.e. 24 hours and in some instances greater than 48 hours. Synthetic high molecular weight hydrophilic polymers of acrylic acid, referred to as carbomers, have been used in pharmaceutical applications as a thickening and suspending agent, a bulk laxative, a binder for tablets and as a reactive agent for preparing medicinal salts. It has now been discovered that a pharmaceutical transdermal delivery device can be prepared by solvating a compressed hydrophilic polymer containing a drug. The invention relates to solvated or hydrated compressed matrices for transdermal administration of a drug for use in human and veterinary medicine. These compositions are suitable for establishing therapeutically active blood or skin levels of drug. The matrix comprises a hydrophilic polymer capable of being solvated with a hydrophilic solvent to produce a flexible matrix containing a predetermined amount of liquid, drug and, Optionally, compatible additives. More particularly, the invention relates to a transdermal drug delivery device comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a drug and from 20 to essentially 100 by weight of a hydrophilic polymer said hydrophilic polymer being a synthetic water soluble polymer of acrylic acid cross linked with allyl sucrose containing 56 68 carboxylic groups and having a molecular weight range of from about 1,250,000 to about 4,000,000 which polymer is solvated with 20 to 70 by weight of a hydrophilic solvent. The polymeric materials utilized in preparing the transdermal device of the present invention are characterized as being hydrophilic and possessing suitable flow properties to allow direct compression of the polymer to a tablet or disk configuration. They are water soluble materials which are directly compressible to a tablet or disk configuration. These resins are known as carbomer resins and are available in the trade under the designation CarbopolR resins a trademark of B.F. Goodrich . The preferred R members of this class of resins are CarbopolR 934 P, 940 and 941. The molecular weight of these materials range about 1,250,000 to about 4,000,000. The polymeric matrix may contain other hydrophilic polymers in addition to the carbomer resin. Suitable hydro philic polymers which may be used in combination with carbomer resins include algin, xanthan gum, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and hydrophilic cellulose ethers, for example methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, polypeptides for example, gelatins. When one of the above noted hydrophilic polymers is used in combination with the carbomer resin, it is present from about 1 to about 50 by weight of the total dry weight of the matrix. The dry compressed matrix is solvated with various solvents and solvent systems. Examples of solvents which are useful in preparing the device of this invention are water, buffered aqueous solutions, triethanolamine solution, organic amines, for example, ethomine, and aqueous or hydroalcoholic solutions. It has also been found advantageous to use aqueous solvent systems containing hydrophilic organic solvents or surfactants to solvate the compressed matrix. Hydrophilic organic solvents suitable for solvating the compressed matrix include glycerin, propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like. Mixtures of from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight of a hydrophilic organic solvent are useful. A mixture of glycerin and water, e.g. 20 by weight glycerin in water, allows good retention of the solvent in the matrix, and improves the flexibility and the adherence of the device to the skin. Aqueous solutions of surfactants have also been found useful to solvate the compressed matrix. Suitable surfactants which are useful in the practice of this invention include anionic surfactants, for example, sodium alkylsulfonates nonionic surfactants, for example, polysorbate 80 polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate and cationic surfactants, for example, cetyl pyridinium chloride and benzalkonium chlorides. Aqueous solutions comprising about 0.5 to about 25 by weight of surfactant are useful to solvate the compressed matrix compositions. The amount of drug incorporated in the delivery device of the present invention to obtain the desired therapeutic effect will vary depending upon the desired dosage and the length of time the device is to remain in contact with the skin. The drug may be present in dosages from about 0.01 mg to 1.0 gram for systemic or topical administration. Generally, the loading dose exceeds the available dose. A ten fold excess of drug may be optimal. however, the dose may vary from 1 to 20 times the dose released. In practicing this invention one can employ any drug which will be absorbed by the skin to which the device is applied, or any drug that benefits the patient, even locally. The amount of drug necessary to obtain the desired therapeutic effect will vary depending on the particular drug used.

Examples of penetration enhancers include l dodecylazacycloheptan 2 one, propyleneglycol, and surfactants. In accordance with the present invention the transdermal drug delivery device is prepared by a forming a mixture of a therapeutically effective amount of a drug with about 20 to about 100 by weight of said hydrophilic polymer, b compressing said mixture into a tablet configuration, c solvating said compressed tablet with a hydrophilic solvent, and d removing said hydrophilic solvent to provide said hydrophilic polymer with a solvation degree of from about 20 to about 70 by weight of said hydrophilic solvent. In step a the drug ingredient is mixed with the hydrophilic polymer using conventional mixing techniques utilized in the preparation of pharmaceutical tablets. After sufficient mixing of the ingredients, conventional direct compression or granulation tablet technology is employed in step b produce a tablet matrix of drug and hydrophilic polymer, or drug hydrophilic polymer and additives. A flat surface die of about one inch diameter affords a convenient compressed tablet matrix. It has also been found advantageous to use a die which produces a tablet or disk with a hole in the center. The hole in the tablet or disk allows one to carry out the heating or curing process more conveniently. For example1 a tablet containing a hole can be prepared by core rod tooling on a Menesty Type F3 machine.In compressing the ingredients, pressures of from about 160 to about 960 bar, preferably about 320 to 800 bar are suitable for preparing the compressed matrixes of the present invention. In step c the compressed tablet matrix is solvated with a hydrophilic solvent or solvent system to produce a flexible gelled matrix tablet. The solvents and or solvent systems useful in the practice of this invention are described hereinabove. The dry compressed matrix is solvated under controlled conditions. Solvation is carried out by immersing the dry compressed matrix tablet in the solvent or solvent system at room temperature or higher temperatures. The time the compressed matrix is immersed in the solvent or solvent system may vary from about 1 minute to about 60 minutes. In step d the excess solvent is removed from the solvated compressed matrix under controlled drying conditions. The solvent can be removed by heating the solvated matrix at an elevated temperature depending on the stability of the drug and on the gelation properties of the polymer.Removal of the solvent can be accomplished by heating with microwaves, forced air or under ambient conditions. The temperature range for removing excess solvent can range from about room temperature to about 1000C, preferably about 700C when the solvent is water. The heating process can vary from several minutes to two hours. Generally, a one hour heating period is sufficient to afford a satisfactory product. The degree of solvation may also be controlled by using a vacuum apparatus or vacuum oven. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the device for transdermal drug delivery may be in the form of a two layered compressed tablet. One layer comprises a hydrophilic polymer, for example, the carbomer resin disclosed hereinabove, and a second layer comprises the hydrophilic polymer, i.e. carbomer, and drug. This configuration affords a matrix which contains a high concentration of drug in a thin second layer of carbomer. The two layered matrix is prepared by the techniques disclosed hereinabove for the single layered matrix. For example, the two layered matrix may be prepared by successive compression of the carbomer resin alone followed by compression of the drug containing carbomer resin. The two layers may be compressed under similar or different compression forces. For example, compression of the first layer of carbomer may be compressed about 80 bar and the second layer may be compressed at about 320 bar. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. the device for transdermal drug delivery may be in the form of a two layered compressed tablet composition.One layer of the two layered tablet comprises a hydrophilic polymer containing the drug. for example. the carbomer resin disclosed hereinabove and a second layer comprises a hydrophobic polymer or mixture of hydrophobic polymers. The carbomer resin functions as a hydrophilic reservoir and the hydrophobic layer functions as a release rate limiting layer. Suitable polymers which can be used as the second hydrophobic layer include cellulose derivatives, for example cellulose ethers, such as, ethyl cellulose, and the like, or other hydrophobic materials that can be bound by incorporation of other materials. The hydrophobic layer may also contain various proportions of the hydrophilic carbomer resin. The carbomer resin imports elasticity and adhesivity to the hydrophobic layer which otherwise may disintegrate during the solvation process. The two layered transdermal matrix in a dry state comprises from about 5 90 by weight of hydrophilic polymer and from about 95 10 by weight of hydrophobic polymer or polymers. The two layered matrixes are prepared by techniques disclosed hereinabove for the single layered matrix. For example. the doubled layered matrix may be prepared by successive compression of the hydrophilic polymer, i.e.carbomer, and the hydrophobic polymer or mixture of polymers. The two layers may be compressed under similar or different compression forces. For example, compression of the first layer of hydrophobic resins may be compressed at about 80 bar whereas, the second layer is compressed at about 320 bar pressure. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the device for transdermal drug delivery may be covered with a rate controlling membrane or film. Examples of rate controlling membranes and films which are useful in the practice of the present invention include a polyurethane film available in the trade under the designation RTegaderm , a trademark of 3M Company . The drug delivery device of the present invention requires a means for attaching the matrix to the desired site of the patient. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many and varied means may be employed for securing the device of this invention onto the patient at the desired location. Such means can take various forms, such as an occlusive backing layer forming a kind of bandaged with the drug delivery device being held against the skin of a patient being treated. Any adhesive bandage tape is contemplated as being useful with the present invention. It can also take the form of an elastic band, such a cloth band, a rubbery band, or other material.
