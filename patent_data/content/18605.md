# Enterosoluble capsule and method for its preparation.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel enterosoluble capsule for containing a medicament, which is shaped with a hitherto not used novel cellulose derivative. The cellulose derivative is a mixed ester of an alkyl , hydroxyalkyl or hydroxyalkyl alkyl cellulose esterified with succinyl anhydride and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid anhydride. The enterosoluble capsules have excellent enterosolubility behavior as well as sufficient pliability even without the addition of a plasticizer which is almost indispensable in the prior art materials. The cellulose derivative can be shaped into capsules not only by the con ventional dipping method but also by the plastic deformation at an elevated temperature under pressure such as compres sion molding, vacuum forming, matchedmold forming and the like.
