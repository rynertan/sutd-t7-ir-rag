# Electrical circuit arrangement for igniting and feeding a gas and or vapour discharge tube.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a circuit for an inductively stabilized discharge tube 1 , which is provided with two preheatable electrodes 2, 3 . The ends of one electrode 2 are connected via a first capacitor 22 and a second capacitor 24 , respectively, to the corresponding ends of the other electrode 3 . According to the invention, the second capacitor 24 remote from the supply is shunted by a PTC resistor 23 , the discharge tube 1 and inter alia the PTC resistor 23 forming part of a lamp unit. The discharge tube 1 ignites even at low ambient temperatures readily. In the operating condition, the influence of the PTC resistor 23 is neglible.
