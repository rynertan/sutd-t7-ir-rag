# Process for making pants like undergarment incorporating a partially rigid and partially elastic structure for retaining abdominal tissue in place, particularly for retaining inguinal hernias in place and pantslike obtained with such process.

## Abstract
A pants like undergarment serving as a truss includes an elastic structure, for retaining abdominal tissues, particularly for retaining abdominal inguinal hernia, is of the kind including at least a girdle or belt 1 covering the hernia affectable critical region, at least a pair of undercrotches 2 providing an inter sewn structure evenly elastic joining together with the girdle 1 , at least one opening 4 for genitals, at least one strip 40 of cloth or fabric, covering the opening 4 for genitals and at least an internal pocket 5 , to receive at least one retaining pad 50 . Such pants like is characterized in that, being with out legs and of reduced forward extension, strictly limited to the hernia affectable critical region, it is in the form of pants and each of both undercrotches components 2 results from intersewing of at least one elastic segment 20 and one non elastic segment 22 whereby the total lengthening attitude of each undercrotch 2 is concentrated into the inguinal region.
