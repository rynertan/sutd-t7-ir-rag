# Method for controlling an engine installed with continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
A method for controlling an engine 1 using a con tinuously variable transmission 4 , in which the fuel con sumption of the engine 1 is decreased during a transient shifting condition. When a driver depresses the accelerator 75 and the magnitude of the difference between a steady state engine speed, which corresponds to the amount the throttle means of the engine 1 is opened, and a previously detected engine speed, differs from a predetermined con stant value, the engine speed is gradually changed to the steady state engine speed.
