## Description
CONTINUOUS EXTRACTION OF POLYPHENYLENE SULFIDEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the recovery and purification of poly arylene sulfide resin from the reaction mixture. In another of its aspects, this invention relates to the extraction of water soluble impurities from poly arylene sulfide particles. In still another aspect of this invention, it relates to a continuous process for separating impurities from poly phenylene sulfide particles. In yet another aspect of this invention it relates to the use of a closed cycle of heat exchange streams for heating and cooling polymer slurry. In the production of poly arylene sulfide , particularly poly phenylene sulfide , the reaction mixture usually contains ash producing substances, particularly alkali metal salts. Methods for separating the polymer from the liquid ingredients of the reaction mixture, i.e., unreacted reactant such as dihalobenzene and polyhalobenzene containing more than two halogen constituents polar diluents, such as N methylpyrrolidone and residual water are well known in the art. Some solid contaminant is also removed with the removal of these conponents of the reaction mixture, but often fairly large amounts of ash producing, solid contaminants, such as sodium chloride, remain with the polymer. Up to now, the solid contaminant remaining with the poly arylene sulfide has been removed by repeated extraction with hot water. It has now been found that at an increased temperature level, a continuous process for extracting contaminants from poly phenylene sulfide particles provides a quicker, more efficient method of separation than batch processes of the same temperature. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide an efficient method for the removal of ash forming contaminants, particularly soluble alkali metal salts from poly phenylene sulfide particles. It is another object of this invention to provide an efficient continuous method for removing contaminants from phenylene sulfide polymers utilizing a closed cycle of heat exchange medium in the heating and cooling of the treatment slurry. Other aspects, objects and the various advantages of this invention will become apparent from a reading of the specification, examination of the drawings, and reading the claims.THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, a method is provided for extracting water soluble impurities from aqueous slurries of arylene sulfide polymers containing water soluble impurities. In the method, the polymer containing the impurities is continuously contacted with a sufficient amount of water to produce a slurry containing about 5 to about 20 per cent by weight arylene sulfide polymers with the slurry being continuously transferred in indirect heat exchange contact with hot heat exchange medium to raise the temperature of the slurry to within the range of about 260 to about 4200 F and then continuously separating the polymer from the water. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the slurry is cooled by indirect contact with a heat exchange medium after being heated to a temperature within the range of about 360 to about 4200 F and before separation of polymer from water. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a closed cycle of heat exchange medium is employed to at least partially heat and to at least partially cool the slurry in preparation for the extraction and separation phases of the process. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, a method is set out, as is exemplified herein, in which heat exchange media are indirectly contacted with a treatment slurry after it has been contacted with the closed cycle heat exchange medium in both the heating and the cooling phases of the operation and with passage of the slurry through an agitated tank during the period at which it is held at the highest temperature attained to assure good contact of the contaminant with the heated extractant. The phenylene sulfide polymer which can be treated by the process of this invention can be of any particle size produced in the recovery of polymer from the reaction mixture. The usual particle size of the polymer will range from a fine powder ranging in average size of particle from about 5 to about 1500 micrometers and generally within the range from about 10 to about 150 micrometers such as are produced by recovery from the polymer slurry by a method such as flashing the polar diluent. It is also applicable for the extraction of polymer particles of greater size which are produced by recovery of polymer in the reaction slurry by other methods. The method of extraction according to this invention is applicable to polymers produced by any of the known methods for producing poly arylene sulfide such as those set out in U.S. Patent No. 3,354,129 in which polyphenyl aromatic compounds, alkali metal sulfides, and organic amides are contacted at polymerization conditions, or alternatively, by such methods as set out in U.S. Patent No. 3,919,177 in which 2 dihalobenzene, and alkali metal sulfide, and organic amide, and an alkali metal carboxylate are contacted as polymerization conditions, often together with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, and or a polyhalo aromatic compound, such as 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene. If desired, a lithium halide such as lithium chloride, can be used in place of the alkali metal carboxylate in the production of the polymer.If desired, water which can be present with the reactant can be removed by distillation prior to the polymerization reaction. The processes set out above to produce these polymers will also produce ash forming contaminants such as alkali metal halides, particularly sodium chloride, and also include such contaminants as an amino acid salt, e.g. alkali metal N methyl N 4 chlorophenyl 4 aminobutyrate. Sodium chloride is often produced in an amount of 1 pound of salt per pound of polymer. It has been found that 2 to about 3 percent based on poly phenylene sulfide of the amino acid salt can also be produced in the reaction process.According to the process of this invention, a sufficient amount of these contaminants can be removed from poly phenylene sulfide particle products to provide the sufficiently low ash content required for commercial uses. In the process of this invention, it has been found that for a continuous successful extraction operation, a water slurry containing 3 30 per cent by weight polymer particles, preferably about 5 to about 20 percent by weight polymer particles, must be raised to a temperature in the range of about 300 to about 4200 F to dissolve the contaminants in the water extraction agent. As will be set out below in the examples which are to be read in conjunction with the drawing, the present invention provides a continuous process for extraction of contaminants of the polymer particles which is quicker and more efficient than the previously used processes.THE DRAWING In the drawing, Figure 1 is a line drawing of a continuous high temperature salt extraction unit. Figure 2 is a line drawing of a continuous high temperature salt extraction unit incorporating a closed cycle heat exchange medium system. Example I, below, illustrates the process as set out in Figure 1 and Example III illustrates the process as set out in Figure 2. The examples should be taken as illustrative of the invention and not descriptive. EXAMPLE I In this example, a continuous process for extracting water soluble impurities, chiefly sodium chloride, from essentially uncured poly phenylene sulfide PPS is described. As shown in Figure 1, commercially produced RytonE PPS resin that had undergone several warm water washing operations was mixed in a stirred tank 1 with warm water to produce a slurry having a temperature of about 1400 F and containing about 8 to 14 percent by weight of PPS.The PPS water slurry was pumped, to a pressure of over 200 psig, at a rate of 0.4 gallon per minute by a high pr ssure Moyno pump 2 through several sections of jacketed pipes in series having inner tubes of i inch diameter. In the first pipe section 3 being 16 feet long, a hot heat transfer oil Mobiltherm, marketed by Mobil Oil Company having a temperature of about 3600 F was pumped through the outer jacket countercurrently to the flow of the PPS water slurry in the inner tube.The slurry was heated from about 1400 F to about 3800 F, while the heat transfer oil was cooled to about 1800 F. The residence time of the slurry in this pipe section was about 2 seconds. The slurry was then pumped through several pipe sections 4 so as to attain a total residence time of about 80 seconds, during which the deashing salt extraction at about 3700 F occurred. Subsequently the hot slurry was cooled in an 8 foot long, jacketed pipe section 5 with cold water to a final temperature of about 1500 F and collected in a tank 6 and held there under nitrogen pressure of 200 psig. Then the pressure was relieved, and the cooled slurry was filtered through a 5 square feet Bird Young filter and, optionally, washed with cold water. EXAMPLE II Wet, washed PPS samples deashed by the process of Example I were analyzed for ash content. Ash levels and pertinent process parameters are listed in Table I. TABLE I Type of Weight Deashing Ash Content Deashing of PPS in Temperature weight Run Operation slurry DF Wet Basis 1 Feed 1.6 1.8 2 Continuous 8.0 365 0.94 3 Continuous 8.0 365 0.92 4 Continuous 14.0 372 0.88 5 Continuous 14.0 372 0.80 6 Batch Wise 8.0 360 0.80 0.83Data in Table I indicate that an approximately 50 percent reduction in ash content of prewashed PPS Run 1 was achieved by a continuous deashing operation at 365 3720 F, which lasted about 1.5 minutes. The ash level of PPS samples of Runs 2 5 was comparable to that of Run 6 deashed by a batch process in a stirred vessel at 3600 F, which lasted 5 10 minutes.This result indicates that salt extraction from PPS according to the continuous process of Example I was considerably faster and thus more efficient than a batch process conducted at a comparable temperature. EXAMPLE III In this calculated example the design of an energy efficient continuous process for extracting impurities, primarily sodium chloride, from PPS resin with hot water is described. As shown in Figure 2, an aqueous slurry of PPS having a temperature of about 1400 F is prepared in a slurry tank 1 and is pumped by means of a high pressure pump 2 through a heat exchanger 3 consisting of a steel tube of 1.5 inch diameter and approximately 20 feet length enclosed in a jacket. A hot heat transfer fluid 4 having a temperature of about 3600 F is pumped through the outer jacket of said heat exchanger countercurrently to the flow of the PPS water slurry in the inner tube. The slurry is heated to about 3200 F, while the heat transfer fluid 4 is cooled to about 1800 F and pumped in a closed loop to heat exchange unit 10 .The residence time of the slurry in heat exchanger 3 is about 1 10 seconds. The slurry then passes through a second heat exchanger 5 , which is of similar dimensions as 3 . The temperature of the slurry is raised to about 4000 F by the controlled countercurrent flow of hot oil 6 having a temperature of about 5000 F. The flow rate of 6 is controlled by a valve 7 interfaced with a temperature sensor 8 located in the slurry line behind heat exchanger 5 . The slurry then flows into a tank 9 of about 15 gallon capacity for extracting a substantial portion of water soluble impurities from PPS at a temperature of about 4000 F during a residence time of about 1 3 minutes. The tank 9 can, optionally, be equipped with a stirrer for enhanced agitation. The PPS water slurry is subsequently cooled to about 2200 F in heat exchanger 10 with dimensions similar to the ones of heat exchanger 3 . Heat transfer fluid 4 from 3 having a temperature of about 1800F is passed countercurrently through the outer jacket of 10 and cools the slurry to about 220 2300 F while itself being heated to about 3600 F and recycled to 3 . The slurry is finally cooled to below 2000 F in another heat exchanger 11 with cold water as the cooling fluid, collected in a slurry tank 12 and filtered. A pressure control valve 13 regulates the pressure in the entire deashing system to be approximately 200 psig.
