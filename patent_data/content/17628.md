## Description
Description of the invention entitled Pneumatic activating device In the name of Massimo CA SSIWA RI in Milan Submitted on under Tiro. The subject of this invention is a pneumatic device causing activation by means of a rotary motion to be more .precise, the invention concerns a pneumatic device able to bring about a rotary motion to be employed, for instance, to activate valves or other apparatus.Many devices are commercially available that produce activation with a, rotary motion and use two opposed pistonswhich, through the action of a fluid, move with an alternate .straight, up and down movement in a cylinder. This straight movement is transformed into a rotary movement by means of devices which may be a piston with a slotted link or a piston with a rack. The most frequent shortcoming of these devices, which comprise a pair of pistons having an alternating movement in a cylinder, consists in the tendency of two pistons to lose their alignment or to swivel in the cylinder, with the outcome that they seize up and or damage the inner surfaces of the cylinder, thereby impatrinQ the good watertight seal of the same.A further drawback, which often happens in these types of devices fed with a fluid, lies in the fact that the moving parts are hard to lubricate as the lubricant tends to be drawn away by the pressure of the fluid, with the outcome that the pistons may seize up in the cylinder. Said devices often involve the further shortcoming that a plurality of outside feed pipes has to be fitted so that the fluid can be introduced at one and the same time into the two chambers opposite the pistons so that the latter can be provided with the movement towards each other which is needed to transmit the rotary movement to the prinary shaft. Nith reference to the foregoing the author has conceived and designed a pneumatic activating device providing a rotary motion, which can make use of the crank and slotted link sys .tem or the rack system to transform a straight movement into a rotary movement, as said earlier. According to the invention the pistons have a plurality of guide shafts arranged perpendicularly to the disk which acts as a piston the shafts of one disk are oriented to wards the other disk but are advantageously offset in res .pect of the shafts of the disk towards which they are orient .ed. The shafts lie parallel to each other but, as said, are .advantageously staggered at different angles. Moreover, the shafts have different sizes, and one or more guide shafts can be used to transmit motion to a slot ted link or to a pin ton. According to the invention one or more springs may be .visualized as being located between the disk acting as a piston and the corresponding end of the cylinder. According to a variant said springs can be envisaged as .being positioned between the disks acting as pistons or be between the disks and the axle which takes the rotary motion .to the outside. According to the invention the feed for the two chambers lying between the disks acttng as pistons and the corresponding ends of the cylinder is realized with a duct made in the jacket of the cylinder, so that only one feed is needed for.both chambers. According to the invention once more, the hole to feed. the chamber lying between the two disks acting as pistons is advantageously located near to the feed for the two end cham be rs. The invention tends, therefore, to provIde many advantages and benefits for an end user inasmuch as the latter can avoid frequent checking and maintenance operations, difficult and costly connections and the disadvantage of being condit stoned by the device, and so forth. Furthermore, the invention has the aim of making the drive suitable for the requirements of the user by simply changing some parts and leaving the rest unaltered. The Therefore, the invention is formed with a pneumatic act ivating device suitable for transforming a straight movement pin to a rotary movement, whereby the device is compact and is characterized by having in reciprocal cooperation and coord 4na t ion a plurality of shafts or arms present in the piston disks and stretching towards the other piston disk, at least one shaft per piston having equipment fitted to itself, one single feed duct for both end chambers and feed inlets positioned near to each other, whereby at least one return spring can be included. Let us now see some variants of the invention with the help of the attached tables, which have been given as nonrestrictive examples. In the figures we have the following .Fig.I shows a device with a rack type drive at the outer end .of its run. Fig.2 shows the example of Fig.I at the inner end of its run. Figs. 3a Sb show two possible lay outs of the shafts. Fig.4 shows a cross section along the axle providing output. of the motion. Fig.5 shows a variant using a slotted link at the outer end of its run. .Rig.6 shows the example of Fig.5 with the pistons at the .inner end of their run. .Fig.7 shows a cross section along the axle providing output.of the motion.
