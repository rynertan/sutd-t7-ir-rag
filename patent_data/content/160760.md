# Preparation of trimethoxybenzoate esters and trimethoxybenzoic acid.

## Abstract
A mixture of intermediate products including a carboxy lic salt of 3, 4, 5 trimethoxybenzoic acid TMB acid and a dimethoxy benzoic acid derivative of such salt further containing an oxygen anion in the 3 , 4 , or 5 position is prepared by initially reacting hydrolyzable tannin with a methylation agent in an alkaline medium under methylation conditions to form methylated tannin and thereafter hydro lyzing the methylated tannin by reaction thereof with a hydrolysis agent under alkaline hydrolysis conditions. The resulting reaction mixture is then methylated to form a reaction mixture containing methyl 3, 4, 5 trimethoxybenzoate and a salt of 3, 4, 5 trimethoxybenzoic acid. TMB acid can be formed in high yield by conversion of both the methyl ester thereof and the salt thereof. Such conversion can be effected by hydrolyzing the reaction mixture followed by acidification thereof.
