# Fusion bondable sheet.

## Abstract
A fusion bondable sheet 1 comprises a a crosslinked polyolefin sheet 4 , b a fusion bondable layer 5 formed on one surface of the crosslinked polyolefin sheet, which layer is mainly composed of a polyolefin having a melting point of 80 200 C, a polyolefin having a melting point of 30 75 C and a tackifier, and c a flame retardant sheet 2 bonded to the other surface of the crosslinked polyolefin sheet 4 through a binder or adhesive layer 3 . Preferably, the flame retardant sheet 2 is larger in size than the crosslinked polyolefin sheet 4 and the edges of the former sheet 2 outwardly extend from the edges of the latter sheet 4 . The fusion bondable sheet 1 may be used as an overtape for covering a joint portion of a heat shrinkable cover sheet applied onto a joint of steel pipe or cable and may be also used as a cover sheet for repairing a damaged protecting cover of a steel pipe.
