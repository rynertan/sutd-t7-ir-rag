# A METHOD OF REMOVING A SHEET FROM THE DRUM OF A FACSIMILE TRANCEIVER UNIT

## Abstract
A method of removing a sheet 42 from the drum 30 of a facsimile transceiver unit wherein a drum gripper bar 30 grips an edge of a sheet 42 to be scanned during system operation. On termination of operation, the drum 30 direction is reversed allowing the beam strength of the scanned sheet 42 to lift the free edge 50 of the sheet off the drum 30 . The sheet is then picked off by a suitable member 52 and directed out of the facsimile transceiver unit. At the same time, the gripper bar 32 is opened releasing the sheet for easy operator removal. In a preferred method, the sheet 42 is jogged by the raised gripper bar 32 to ensure release of the sheet from the facsimile transceiver unit.
