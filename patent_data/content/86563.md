The sulphonation reaction may be conveniently performed using a sulphur trioxide complex, examples of which include pyridine sulphur trioxide, dimethylformamide sulphur trioxide, trimethylaminesulphur trioxide, lutidine sulphur trioxide, dioxansulphur trioxide and chlorosulphonic acid sulphur trioxide. A preferred reagent is pyridine sulphur trioxide. The sulphonation reaction is performed at a non extreme temperature such as O 800C, more suitably 100 50 C and conveniently at ambient temperature. Normally the reaction is performed in a solvent, for example an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, dioxan, tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof. Of these the p eCe sseJ solvent is dimethylformamide. It will be appreciated that the sulphonation reaction may lead to the preparation of a specific salt of the ss lactam, for example where the reagent used is pyridine sulphur trioxide, the salt formed is the pyridinium salt. This may be converted to any other desired salt using conventional methods of ionreplacement, for example using ion exchange resin, ion pair extraction, crystallisation and precipitation. Compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is protected amino may be converted to compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is carboxylic acylamino via the intermediacy of the compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is amino. Suitable amino protecting groups include those known in the ss lactam art to be convertible to amino, for example hydrogenolysable groups, such as benzyloxycarbonylamino.

The oxirane is preferably a C1,6 1,2 alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. The acylation reaction using an acid halide may be carried out at a temperature in the range 500C to 500C, preferably 200C to 200C, in aqueous or non aqueous media such as aqueous acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the reaction may be carried out in an unstable emulsion of water immiscible solvent, especially an aliphatic ester or ketone, such as methyl isobutyl ketone or butyl acetate. The acid halide may be prepared by reacting the acid IX or a salt thereof with a halogenating eg.chlorinating or brominating agent such as phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Alternatively, the N acylating derivative of the acid IX may be a symmetrical or mixed anhydride.Suitable mixed anhydrides are alkoxyformic anhydrides, or anhydrides with, for example carbonic acid mono esters, trimethyl acetic acid, thioacetic acid, diphenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, phosphorus acids such as phosphoric or phosphorous acids, sulphuric acid or aliphatic or aromatic sulphonic acids such as p toluenesulphonic acid.

Preferably in the sulphonation of a compound of the formula VIII to provide a compound of the formula I , and during any subsequent interconversion of a group R1 to another group R1, the 3R CH2OH group may be protected, for example, as a silyl derivative removable by hydrolysis, or by fluoride ion or an acylated group removable by hydrogenolysis. Examples of such suitable protecting groups include tertiarybutyldimethylsilyl or benzyloxycarbonyl or a substituted benzyloxycarbonyl such as p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, so that a silyloxy or benzyloxycarbonyloxy group is formed. In a further aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I or VIII which process comprises the reaction of a coiapour.d of the formula X EMI17.1 wherein R2 and R3 are as hereinbefore defined, R17 is hydrogen, SO3H or a protecting group, and R18 is an optionally substituted aromatic ring with formaldehyde and thereafter, if necessary i optionally protecting the CHzOH group ii converting R18 CH N to an amino group iii converting said amino group to a carboxylic acylamino group iv converting a compound wherein R17 is not SO3H to a compound wherein R17 is SO3H, v removing any protecting groups.

The solution was vigorously stirred for 18 hours in the presence of 3A molecular sieves. The mixture was filtered through Kieselguhr and the filtrate evaporated. The residue slowly crystallised and was recrystallised from hexane to provide 33 3.26 g alpha 19D 205 c 0.8 in CHCl3 max CHCl3 1740, 1635, 1520, and 1350 cm 1 CDC13 0.99 9H, s , 3.47 1H, dd, J 6.5 and 3Hz , 3.68 1H, dd, J 6.5 and 6Hz , 5.0 1H, m , 7.92 2H, s, J 8Hz , 8.28 2H, s, J 8Hz , and 8.55 lH, slightly broadened s, J ca 0.5Hz .
