# Hydrazine thruster.

## Abstract
Hydrazine thruster 10 is mounted on support flange 14 with thermal mass 12 therebetween. The thermal mass 12 extracts sufficient heat so that the incoming hydrazine in inlet line 20 and the surrounding catalyst is maintained at a tempera ture below the hydrazine saturation temperature at the pres sure within chamber housing 24 so that at any on off operating duty cycles for that installation, the hydrazine is discharged into the catalyst in chamber housing 24 as liquid.
