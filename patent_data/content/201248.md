# Controlled electrical contacts for electrical switchgear.

## Abstract
An electrical switch for current interruption comprises, on a contact surface 26 thereof, a semiconductor switching assem bly 16 having a gate electrode 18 for controlling electrical flow therethrough. For D.C. applications, the switching assembly may include a source region, a drain region and a gate electrode. For A.C. applications, the switching assembly may comprise two sub assemblies 16a, 16b of four elements each, each sub assembly comprising alternating P type and N type elements mounted in anti parallel configuration on the contact surface.
