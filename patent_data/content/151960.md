# Implement for pre skiing exercices.

## Abstract
The object of the invention is a pre skiing exercise implement which enables to perform body and leg move ments which are similar to those performed when turning Christiania like to the right and to the left during a downhill run. This implement comprises two support bars 2 which are set in a parallel, side by side relation in the fashion of a par of ski, and which are provided with means 3 for fastening to each one of them a ski boot, either directly or through the respective ski 4 . These support bars 2 have their rest end section slidably bearing on an inverted V shaped supporting cross member 6 , and at an intermedi ate position are supported by an articulated bar supporting device 7 , in which each one of the bars 2 can rock independently from the other bar, around an associated horizontal axis of inclination X which is transversal thereto, and both bars 2 can simultaneously perform concordant equal angular movements around associated upstanding axes of rotation Y , which are vertical, or are preferably inclined rearwardly toward the inverted V rear supporting cross member 6 .
