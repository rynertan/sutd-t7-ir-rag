# Vibration damper with variable rate springs and damping friction.

## Abstract
A vibration damper assembly for the clutch driven plate utilized in an automotive vehicle which provides a first stage of travel with a low spring rate and zero or low damping friction and a second stage of travel with an increased spring rate and increased damping friction as required for the remaining travel. A generally conventional clutch driven plate assembly has aligned spring windows in the plates and hub flange receiving low rate compression springs and additional aligned spring windows receiving the higher rate compression springs the windows in the hub flange being enlarged relative to the windows in the plates, a generally annular friction plate 35,48 received within the central opening of the spring retainer plate with peripheral tangs 36,50 on the friction plate received in enlarged notches 32,51 in the retainer plate inner periphery to provide a limited lost motion, and a thrust plate 37,46 and Belleville spring 39 urging said friction plate against the hub.
