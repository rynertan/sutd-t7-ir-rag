# Method and apparatus for the high precision manufacture of glass products, in particular lenses.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for the high precision manufac ture of glass lenses, in which a roughly measured volume of softened glass is transferred in a product holder from a fur nace to a position between two moulds, the moulds being sub sequently moved towards one another so that the excess glass is pressed away from between the moulds. The moulds and the product holder are moved at relative speeds such that the moulds contact the article simultaneously the movement of the moulds being terminated when they reach a given position with respect to one another.
