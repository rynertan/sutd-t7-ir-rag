# Vertical semiconductor integrated circuit chip packaging.

## Abstract
A semiconductor chip 10 is so designed that the signal and power terminals 12 are brought to one edge of the integrated circuit chip. The integrated circuit chip is then mounted vertically on a substrate 11 which provides signal interconnection and power distribution to the inte grated circuit chips as well as a thermal path for conduc ting heat away from the chips. The electrical connection from the semiconductor chip to the substrate may be by solder reflow or thermal compression bonding techniques. The package is particularly advantageous for memory in tegrated circuit chips. The vertical integrated circuit chips may alternatively be carried by a tape carrier 30, 52 which is formed into a convoluted form with all integrated circuit chips positioned substantially vertically thereon. This car rier is then bonded electrically and physically to a substrate 65 in areas associated with the integrated circuit chips 50 so that when the substrate is substantially horizontal the integrated circuit chips are substantially vertical in re lation thereto. In this alternative, electrical connections may be made to more than one edges of the integrated cir cuit chips.
