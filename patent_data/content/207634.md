# Bonding primer composition.

## Abstract
The novel primer compositions of this invention com prise 1 a silane containing at least one t butyl peroxy group and no silicon bonded ethylenically unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals, 2 an organosilicon compound containing at least two alkoxy groups and at least one addition or condensation reactive functional group per molecule, 3 an organotitanate ester and 4 sufficient organic solvent to achieve a solution of the desired viscosity. These compositions, cohesively bond silicone rubber, particularly fluorosilicone rubber, to a variety of substrates.
