# PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER FOR USE IN SUBLIMATION TRANSFER COLOR HARD COPYING.

## Abstract
Photographic paper for use in sublimation transfer color hard copying comprising a base material having formed thereon a layer comprising a thermoplastic resin dyeable with dispersed dyes part of which resin is replaced by a compound having two or more radical polymerizable un saturated bonds in the molecule. This paper is designed so that a sublimatable dye is transferred to the resin layer to form color. It can effectively prevent welding with a dyeing ribbon upon conducting color hard copying and enables to complete transfer of dye, thus realizing good coloration.
