# Apparatus for removing liquid during the winding of a filament.

## Abstract
For removing excess liquid coating medium from the surface of a cylinder formed from winding a filament treated with the coating medium an inclined elongate collector 2 is disposed beneath a path of travel of the filament 6 from a wetting bath 13 to the cylinder 1 . A follower 9 pivotally mounted on the collector 2 is urged continuously into con tact with the cylinder 1 during winding to remove excess coating medium from the surface of the cylinder and to deposit the excess in the collector for return to the wetting bath.

## Claims
Claims 1.

Apparatus according to claim 1 including selectively adjustable means 12 for urging the follower 9 into contact with the cylinder 1 .

## Description
Improvements in winding apparatus This invention relates to apparatus for winding a filament treated with liquid coating medium into a cylinder. In particular, the invention concerns apparatus for removing excess coating medium from the cylinder during a winding operation. During winding operations a filament or fibre can be impregnated or coated with a medium which when set and cured serves to embed the filament or fibre winding in a solid encaaement. It will be appreciated that the removal of excess medium resulting from the winding of impregnated or coated filament or fibre is desirable in providing a body which is regular or symmetrical in shape and quality such that the encasement is of controllable and reproduceable thickness and properties. According to the invention, apparatus for winding a filament treated with liquid coating medium into a cylinder comprises an inclined elongate coating medium collector disposed beneath a path of travel of the filament from a wetting bath to the cylinder, a follower pivotally mounted on the collector and urged continuously into contact with the surface of the cylinder at a position above the centre line during winding whereby to remove excess coating medium from the surface of the cylinder and to deposit the excess coating medium in the collector for return to the wetting bath. The invention will be described further, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a side elevation of an apparatus for removing excess coating medium from a winding during formation of the winding. A winding comprises a cylinder 1 formed from a filament or fibre 6 coated or impregnated with an encasing medium which is in liquid form when applied but is subsequently gelled and cured to solidify it and encase the filament or fibre winding. A mandrel can be employed during winding and subsequently removed, with or without a solid former or internal liner left in position after winding. One example is of glass fibre winding with epoxy resin as coating medium, with or without a metallic former or liner. The apparatus comprises an elongate length adjustable coating medium collector 2 supported by a stand or bracket 4, length adjustability enabling the collector 2 to accommodate an increase in diameter of the cylinder 1 during winding thereof. The collector 2 has a pulley 7 at one end, to guide the filament or fibre 6 to the cylinder 1. The cylinder 1 is rotated anti clockwise in this example, as shown by the arrow. The length of the collector 2 can be adjusted manually by means of a ratchet 3. The collector 2 is formed with sides and a floor and also with a removable cover 5 having a handle 8. In its operational position the collector is inclined as shown to return coating medium to a wetting bath 13. The filament is passed through the medium in the bath and then along the length of the collector to the pulley 7 and on to the cylinder 1. A follower 9 is carried by a bracket 11 which straddles the collector. The end of the follower bears against the cylinder 1 at a position above the centre line of the cylinder. The bracket 11 is pivotally mounted on the collector and is counterbalanced by a removable or adjustable weight 12 whereby to selectively adjust the load applied by the follower 9 to the cylinder 1. The follower 9 is channel section with the floor 10 of the channel uppermost. In use, the follower 9 removes excess coating medium from the surface of the cylinder 1. The excess coating medium as removed drops off the follower into the collector and is returned to the reservoir.
