# Aluminum nitride sintered body and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an aluminum nitride sintered body compris ing aluminum nitride, rare earth element aluminum com pounds and alkaline earth metal aluminum compounds, and a process for producing an aluminum nitride sintered body, which comprises adding to aluminum nitride powder a powder of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of rare earth element oxides, rare earth element fluorides and compounds capable of being con verted into these oxides or fluorides by calcination, and b powder of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of alkaline earth metal oxides, alkali earth metal fluorides and compounds capable of being converted into these oxides or fluorides by calcination, in a total amount of 0.01 to 20 wt as calculated on the weight of the oxides or the fluorides, and then molding and sintering the resultant mixture.
