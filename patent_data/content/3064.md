# METHOD FOR INTRODUCING ANALOGS OF VITAMIN A INTO THE RESPIRATORY TRACT OF A CIGARETTE SMOKER

## Abstract
Natural and synthetic analogs of vitamin A are introduced into the mouth and respiratory tract of a cigarette smoker in the form of droplets 11 or aerosol by incorporating the vitamin A analog in at least one rupturable capsule 13 contained within the mouthpiece end or over the entire length of a cigarette 1 , which may also be filtered. The capsules are rupturable under the influence of pressure or heat. The heat can be derived from the hot tobacco smoke or directly from the burning tobacco charge.
