## Description
The instant invention is directed to a new class of substituted tetrazolinone compounds. More specifically, the instant invention relates to a new class of substituted tetrazolinone compounds which are useful as pre emergence herbicides, post emergence herbicides, and or as plant growth regulators. The synthesis of certain substituted tetrazolinones is known in the art. Thus, Howitz, et al, JACS, EP 0146279 discloses certain substituted tetrazolinones for use as herbicides. Plant growth regulant utility is not disclosed. The need for effective herbicides, both pre emergence and post emergence needs no special emphasis. The control of weeds and undesirable vegetation is of great economic importance since weed competition inhibits the production of foliage, fruit or seed of agricultural crops. The presence of weeds can reduce harvesting efficiency and the quality of the harvested crop. Weed control is essential for maximum production of many agronomic and horticultural crops including corn, Moreover, the need for agricultural chemicals having significant effects on the growth and development of crop plant species is similarly well known. Thus, for many crops, it is highly desirable that certain plant growth regulatory effects by accomplished. In general, these growth regulatory effects include one or more of the following dwarfing, cessation of terminal growth, inhibition or stimulation of axillary and intercalary growth, retardation or stimulation of internode elongation, inhibition or stimulation of flowering or reproductive development, and the like. It has now been found that a new class of substituted tetrazolinones unexpectedly provides excellent pre emergence and post emergence herbicidal properties and or plant growth regulatory effects. In accordance with the instant invention, a compound having the formula wherein R is In further accordance with the instant invention a composition is provided comprising the compound of this invention with a carrier. In still further accordance with the present invention a method for controlling weeds and undesirable vegetation employing the composition of this invention is taught.

The present invention is directed to a compound having the structural formula wherein R is Among the more preferred compounds of this invention are those wherein Particularly preferred compounds include More preferably, when the compound of this invention is to be employed as a plant growth regulator, the invention is directed to a compound having the structural formula given above wherein R is Most preferred compounds for plant growth regulatory purposes include The compounds of this invention are prepared by reacting a tetrazolinone compound having the formula wherein M is hydrogen or alkali metal such as Li, Na or K and R is as defined above with a carbamoyl halide having the formula XCONR¹R², wherein X is chlorine or bromine and R¹ and R² have the meanings above. When M is hydrogen, the reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of a suitable acid acceptor such as pyridine or a tertiary amine e.g., triethylamine . It is noted that this tetrazolinone compound may be synthesized by the methods disclosed in the Horwitz et al and Tsuge et al references mentioned above. The equivalent ratio of X M as representative of the above reactants may vary from about 0.75 1 to about 2 1, preferably from about 0.9 1 to about 1.5 1. Excess of M may be advantageous in the purification of product since the M type tetrazolinone is soluble in base. The reaction temperature may range from about 40 C to the boiling point of the solvent used. Typically, the reaction is conducted under reflux conditions. Suitable solvents are those which are inert to the reactant, such as acetone, acetonitrile, toluene, chloroform and the like. The reaction time may vary from several minutes or less to several hours or more depending on factors such as reaction batch size, reaction temperature, and the like. The instant invention is also directed to a composition comprising the substituted tetrazolinone compound of this invention and a carrier therefor. The carrier employed in one preferred embodiment of this invention is a finely divided or granular inorganic or organic material such as attapulgite clay, sand, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, activated carbon and the like. The compound of this invention may be impregnated on the finely divided or granular material. The carrier may also be an inert powder. Preferably, the inert powder is one of the mineral silicates, e.g., mica, talc, pyrophyllite and clays. In this case, the composition is formed by grinding the compound of this invention into a fine powder and mixing it with the inert powder to which a surface active dispersing agent has been added. A third carrier is the combination of the above inert powder and water. This carrier employs the wettable powder dispersed in water. Yet another carrier is a solvent and water. In this embodiment the compound of this invention is dissolved in a solvent such as benzene, toluene or other aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon. An emulsifiable concentrate is formed with the addition of a surface active and or dispersing agent. The emulsifiable concentrate is then dispersed in water.

It is noted that the surface active agents preferred for use in the composition of this invention are well known to those skilled in the art. In addition, suitable surface active agents for use in the composition of this invention are provided in McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers, 1970, Allured Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, N.J. U.S. Patent 2,614,916, columns 2 to 4 and U.S. Patent 2,547,727, columns 3 and 4. The present invention is furthermore directed to a method of controlling weeds, both pre emergence and post emergence, by application of a herbicidally effective amount of the composition of this invention. In the case where the composition comprises impregnated granules of the compound of this invention, application, to control weeds, is by spreading on the soil. The wettable powder may be similarly applied. In the case where the wettable powder is dispersed in water, this composition controls weeds by spraying the dispersion on weeds or unwanted vegetation or onto the soil surface. Where an emulsion is formed that emulsion is likewise sprayed onto the weeds or onto the soil surface. When employed as a herbicide, the concentration of the compound of this invention in the composition of this invention may vary widely, e.g. from 1 to 95 . The concentration of active compound in dispersions applied to the soil or foliage is generally from 0.002 to about 75 . For use as a pre emergence herbicide the compound of this invention is typically applied at rates of from about 0.05 to about 25 pounds per acre from about 0.056 to about 28 kg ha to soil which contains weed and crop seed, namely either to the surface of the soil or incorporated into the upper one to three inches 2.5 to 7.5 cm. of soil. As a post emergence herbicide, the compound is typically applied at rates of from about 0.05 to about 25 pounds per acre from about 0.056 to about 28 kg ha to the foliage of weeds. The compound may be employed singly or as a mixture of two or more chemicals. When employed as a herbicide, the most suitable rate of application in any given case will depend on such factors as soil type, soil pH, soil organic matter content, the quantity and intensity of rainfall before and after treatment, the air and soil temperature, light intensity and light duration per day. All of these factors can have an influence on the efficacy of the chemicals for a given weed control use. The herbicide use may include control of vegetation at industrial sites or selective weed control in crop fields.
