# Apparatus recording information on an electrically conductive backed medium.

## Abstract
The recorder includes a CRT 24 to create an image on a carbon backed dry silver paper web 22 , and a brush 14 for directing electrical energy to the carbon backing to heat the paper and hence develope the image. The brush is made up of a large number of wire bristles which contact the web in a substantially continuous fashion across the web, the bristles being fine enough to bend and make flexible contact with the carbon backing.
