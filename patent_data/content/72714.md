# SILVER HALIDE PRECIPITATION PROCESS WITH WITHDRAWAL OF A PORTION OF THE DISPERSING MEDIUM, THROUGH THE REACTION VESSEL

## Abstract
A process comprising forming a radiation sensitive silver halide dispersion by reacting silver and halide salts in solution within a dispersing medium to form silver halide grain nuclei within the dispersing medium and allowing silver halide grain growth to occur in a reaction vessel in which the silver halide grain nuclei and the dispersing medium are present. During silver halide grain growth, a portion of the dispersing medium is withdrawn from the reaction vessel through an ultrafiltration membrane while the silver halide grains are retained within the dispersing medium remaining within the reaction vessel.
