# Supported catalyst for the synthesis of 1 2 dichloroethane by oxychlorination of ethylene within a fluidized bed.

## Abstract
A supported catalyst for the C₂H₄ oxychlorination within a fluidized bed, comprising a Cu compound in amounts cor responding to a content from 1 to 10 by weight as Cu metal on a carrier preferably selected from the group con sisting of microspheroidal Al₂O₃, microspheroidal SiO₂ and microspheroidal silica alumina, characterized in that the molar ratio outer Me outer Cu , as determined by means of XPS analysis, is at least 40 higher than the molar ratio
