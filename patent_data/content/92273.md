# Sauce compositions containing agglomerated particles of specified size distribution.

## Abstract
Vegetable protein particle containing sauces, such as spaghetti sauces, which are organoleptically superior to the same sauces containing real meat can be prepared by provid ing protein particles having a specified particle size distribu tion. This is preferably accomplished by agglomerating finely comminuted protein particles with binder in a heating step.
