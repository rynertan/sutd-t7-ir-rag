# Preparation of olefin polymerization catalysts and their use.

## Abstract
Catalysts for use in the polymerization of 1 olefins in combination with aluminium organometallic compound cocatalysts are made by A removing surface absorbed water from a support material which is silica and or alumina having surface hyd roxyl groups by i drying or calcining the support at an elevated temp erature, or ii reacting the support with an organosilicon com pound, and B reacting the treated support with i an organosilicon compound which is reactive with the surface hydroxyl groups and which has the formula R₃Si ₂NH, in which the R groups, which may be the same or different, are C₁ C₂₀ alkyl, aryl, akaryl or aralkyl groups, the amount of the organosilicon compound being in excess of that required to react with the surface hydroxyl groups pres ent in the support, ii a Group IIA organometallic compound or a complex of a Group IIA organometallic compound with a Group IIIA organometallic compound, and iii at least one compound of a Group IVB or Group VB transition metal.
