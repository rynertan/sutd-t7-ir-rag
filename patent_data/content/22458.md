# Hierarchical computer system for entrance control.

## Abstract
Hierarchical three level computer system for receiving input messages from signal sources 23 and for conditionally activating output devices 26 according to input messages the system comprising a host computer 15 , a terminal computer 27 and a number of micro computers 22 . The central computer enters condition tables into specific storage modules 2A 2E within the terminal computer. These tables can be displayed on the terminal computer screen 10 and may be updated from the terminal computer keyboard 8 . The micro computer receives input signals from a signal source 22 and composes input messages, which are transferred to the terminal computer. The terminal computer makes a comparison between input messages and condition table data and selectively activates the output devices 26 .
