# A device for induction welding.

## Abstract
A device for induction welding, comprising an electrical ly conducting arrangement for creating a magnetic field. A layer comprising essentially non magnetic, electrically conducting particles in a support matrix of an electrically non conducting material is arranged for modifying the magnetic field, such that the available energy may be collected in the welding area areas .
