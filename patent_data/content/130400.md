# Microphone.

## Abstract
A wind breath screen for a microphone 1 includes a rigid perforated structure 2 for enclosing the microphone, and mounted by a resilient grommet on the microphone support arm. The microphone has a physical isolation from the rigid perforated structure by the surrounding air space 3 which is maintained as dead air by a porous latex foam layer 4 which encloses the rigid perforated structure.
