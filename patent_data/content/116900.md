# Ski shoe sole.

## Abstract
A ski shoe sole 1 of a type provided with a rear recess 16 and a peg 9 in the sole bottom toe portion for removable engagement with ski bindings has on its inside a reinforcing element 8 extending longitudinally and central ly over approximately the full length of the sole 1 . The reinforcing element 8 is enlarged and flattened at the front, and has progressively increasing thickness and width dimen sions toward the rear. The reinforcing element 8 is formed from a plastic material and the sole remainder is cured, heat formed, or injected all around it. The recess 16 is formed rearwards of the reinforcing element 8 , and the front peg 9 is secured to a metal plate 11 accommodated in the reinforcing element 8 parallel to the sole main plane. The sole 1 is substantially rigid as far as ski binding induced stresses are concerned, but is adequately flexible at the toe region to facilitate normal walking.
