# Optical scanning arrangement.

## Abstract
A scanning arrangement for an infra red imaging device in which a column of I.R. detectors, and similarly a column of L.E.D. s, scans a field broadside to produce a band of parallel line scans, a number of such band scans being provided to cover the field. Each band scan is performed by a respective mirror facet of a rotating polygonal drum, the facets being tilted at slightly different angles to provide the band displacement. Non uniformity of the column of I.R. detectors or the L.E.D. s or the interconnecting channels tends to produce the same pattern of non uniformity within each band. This is overcome according to the invention by periodically tilting the drum by a random fraction of a bandwidth so that on successive occasions a particular element of the field is processed by different detector L.E.D. channels.
