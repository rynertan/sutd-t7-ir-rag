# PC board transparent quiet connector for integrated circuits.

## Abstract
A connector for an integrated circuit or other electronic component includes means for mounting and electrically connecting a decoupling capacitor 64 entirely within the housing of the connector to provide an interconnection board transparent quiet connector. The capacitor is mounted within a central slot 18 provided therefor in the housing. Clips having insulation displacing IDC slots 60 and integr ally formed cantilever beams 68 are mounted within slots provided therefor in the housing. Internally to the housing, the IDC slots electrically contact the leads of the capacitor, and the cantilever beams electrically contact preselected ones of the signal contacts of the connector. When the quiet connector is mounted to a printed circuit PC or other interconnection board, its leads are transparent to the board requiring neither special drilling thereinto nor other specialized handling.

## Description
Title PC Board Transparent Quiet Connector for Integrated Circuits. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is drawn to the field of electrical interconnection devices, and more particularly, to an interconnection board transparent quiet connector. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Miniature, integrated circuits are commonly mounted into DIP electrical connectors and other socketed bodies. The sockets of the connectors typically have a female portion adapted to removably receive the leads of the integrated circuits, and an extending male portion adapted to be inserted in, and soldered to, either printed circuit or other interconnection boards. So called quiet connectors are employed whenever it is desirable to suppress undesirable voltage spikes and other transient signals. The heretofore known quiet connectors for integrated cL. cuits have a decoupling capacitor mounted within a recessed slot provided therefor in the housing of the connector.The leads from the capacitor are accepted in clips that are bottom loaded into the housing of the quiet connectorThe clips each have an elongated, depending electrode that extends below the housing and butts preselected ones of the extending male portions of the sockets of the connectors in a parallel and contiguous manner. Among other disadvantages, the combined thickness dimension of the parallel and contiguous butted leads requires the special provision of over sized lead receiving holes therefor in PC and other interconnection boards. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The novel quiet connector for integrated circuits and other electronic components of the present invention overcomes these and other disadvantages and neither requires external, butted leads nor oversized holes therefor in PC or otherInterconnection boards.
