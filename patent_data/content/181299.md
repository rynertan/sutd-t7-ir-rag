# A METERING VALVE

## Abstract
A metering valve for extracting a given volume of fluid from a first fluid flow and introducing the thus extracted volume of fluid to a second fluid flow, comprising a stationary valve component provided with a first and a second supply channel and a first and a second discharge channel, and a metering component which can be rotated relative to the stationary valve component and which incorporates a metering channel of the aforementioned given volume. In accordance with the invention, the valve component 2 has a planar surface 9 into which the aforementioned supply and discharge channels open out. The metering component 7 also includes a planar surface 10 which abuts against the planar surface 9 of the valve component 2 and into which the two ends of the metering channel open out. These ends are so located that in the first position of rotation of the metering component 7 in relation to the valve component 2 they connect the first supply channel with the first discharge channel of the valve component 2 and in a second position of rotation connect the second channels of the valve component 2 .
