# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which patterns are formed in a layer of sillicon nitride by means of ion implantation.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, in which ions are implanted into a layer of silicon nitride 2 over a part of its surface, after which the layer is subjected to an etching treatment. After the implantation, but before the etch ing treatment, the layer of silicon nitride 2 is subjected to a heat treatment, as a result of which the implanted part 4 of the layer obtains a higher resistance to etching than the nonimplanted part thereof. Thus, a negative image of a pat terned ion irradiation can be formed in the silicon nitride layer 2 . As a result, the number of cases in which an etching or oxidation mask can be formed in a silicon nitride layer without using additional masks is increased considerably.
