# CATALYST, CATALYST COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF OLEFINS

## Abstract
A catalyst composition can be obtained by treating a magnesium halide tetravalent, halogenated titanium compound mixture with a magnexium alkoxide. The catalyst composition can be combined with a metallic hydride or, preferably, an organometallic co catalyst, e.g., an organoaluminium compound, to form a catalyst useful for the polymerization of alpha olefins.
