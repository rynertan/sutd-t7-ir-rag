# High current density, acid free electrolytic descaling process.

## Abstract
A process for removing an oxide scale from the surface of a metallic body is disclosed comprising the steps of providing an electrolyte consisting of an aqueous solution containing 15 to 25 weight percent sodium sulfate, maintain ing the electrolyte at a temperature of at least 65.6 C 150 F , and immersing the metallic body into the electrolyte such that the surface to be descaled is exposed to the electrolyte. During immersion, the metallic body is subjected as the anode to the action of a direct electric current for a period of at least 10 seconds at a current density of at least 46.5 amps dmÂ² 3 amperes per square inch .
