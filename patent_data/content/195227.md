# MAGNETO OPTICAL DISC MEMORY

## Abstract
Magneto optical disc memory. In a recording medium which has a disc like substrate 1 and a magnetic film 2 provided thereon so that the data can be written thereon relying upon the change in the direction of magnetization, a magneto optical disc memory wherein said magnetic film 2 is provided with spiral or concentric guide tracks 21 which have said recording medium with a magnetic pole of a direction opposite to that of a recording region 22 between said guide tracks, and which further have an optical head that can be relatively moved in the radial direction of said recording medium, said optical head being equipped with an optical system 11, 12, 13 which applies a light beam 14 onto the recording region of said recording medium to write or reproduce the data and which also applies a light beam 15 to erase the data, and said optical head being further equipped with a detector system 16, 17, 18 which detects the direction of polarization of the light beam reflected by said recording medium.
