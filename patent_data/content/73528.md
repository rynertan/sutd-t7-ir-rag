# CONNECTOR FOR A FLEX MEMBRANE

## Abstract
A connector for coupling membrane connectors 22 on a flex membrane to the conductive tracers 17 on a printed circuit board 16 comprises an elongated connec tor body 11 having a resilient pressure member 12 mounted along the lower edge thereof. The pressure member overlies the flex membrane and biasing means 13 draw the connector body to the printed circuit board pressing the membrane connectors 22 into contact with the conductive tracers 17 .
