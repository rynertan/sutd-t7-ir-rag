# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EVAPORATIVE COOLING

## Abstract
Evaporative cooling particularly useful for semiconduc tor integrated circuits is more efficient when a liquid is com pletely evaporated at the heat radiating surface. The liquid is converted to droplets and mixed with the gas at the heat radiating surface. In the figure, heat from chip 2 is transferred to heat ex change member 3 comprising heat sump 4 and porous sin tered member 5. Water, air and exhaust products are deli vered and removed by manifold 11 and conduit member 12. Water is delivered through the space between elements 13, 14, air through the space between elements 14, 15 and the exhaust products removed through space 18.
