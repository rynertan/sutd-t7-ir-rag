# Focussing error detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A focussing error detecting apparatus includes a compound lens 30 and a photo detector 8 disposed behind the lens 30 . The lens 30 comprises a pair of lens regions 30a, 30b divided by a boundary plane T including an optical axis O of light incident on the lens 30 , the lens regions 30a, 30b having back focal lengths which are different from each other, and optical axes 0₁0₂ of the lens regions 30a, 30b being spaced apart from each other. The photo detector 8 is so placed that the photo detect ing face thereof is at a middle position on the optical axis O of the incident light between focal points at which the emitted light from the lens regions 30a, 30b is focussed. The photo detector 8 comprises first and second photo detecting elements 8A, 8B for receiving the emitted light which has passed through the first lens region 30a at outer and inner regions relative to the boundary plane T , and third and fourth photo detecting elements 8C, 8D for receiving the emitted light which has passed through the second lens region 30b at outer and inner regions relative to the boundary plane T . Based upon a difference between a sum of signals from the first and fourth photo detecting elements 8A, 8D and a sum of signals from the second and third photo detecting elements 8B, 8C , a focussing error signal is produced.
