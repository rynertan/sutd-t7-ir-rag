# Sheet material.

## Abstract
A laminated wrapping sheet material comprising a layer of paper bonded to a layer of plastics film, is formed such that a layer of paper of 15 35 gsm gauge is discontinuously bonded to a layer of plastics film of 8 35 microns such that pockets of air are defined between the layers. The sheet material is useful in the construction of a captive flap bag formed of a paper plastics film laminate and comprising two superimposed walls with plastics film on the inside, closed at the bottom and on each of the two side edges, and open at the top edge, at least one wall having a reflex internal flap along the top edge sealed at each of the side edges, to define an internal inverted pocket, the two walls not being sealed to each other in the region of the pocket or pockets.
