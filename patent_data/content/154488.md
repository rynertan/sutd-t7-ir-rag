## Abstract
A non asbestos clutch facing has an actual density such that the facing is permeable to air. The clutch facing is preferably a moulded facing containing short reinforcing fibres and having an actual density not greater than 90 of theoretical. The facing may be made by a technique in which a pre form is prepared, moulded to the desired density and then cured under a pressure such as not to cause substantial further density change.
