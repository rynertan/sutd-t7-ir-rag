# Preparation of monolithic support structures containing high surface area agglomerates.

## Abstract
High surface area agglomerates of a porous oxide for the support of catalysts are provided. The agglomerates, in coarse particulate form, are incorporated into a sinterable ceramic structure as a discrete discontinuous phase. The agglomerates provide the high surface area necessary for effective catalyst support within the ceramic structure, which is sintered to provide appreciable density and strength. The particles of a high surface area agglomerate are provided by a mixing into a substantially homogeneous body i a porous oxide having a surface area of at least 20 mÂ² g selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, spinel, titania, zeolite, zirconia, and mixtures of these and ii a binder for the oxide, b drying the body and c forming the body into particles having a median diameter of 50 250 microns.
