# Optically active isocarbostyril derivatives and a method of preparing the same.

## Abstract
Four different optical isomers of a new compound, 1 2 o methoxyphenoxyl 1 methylethylamino 3 4 isocarbostyriloxyl 2 propanol are now provided as new sub stances. These four optical isomers are now nominated as 2R, 1 S 1 2 o methoxyphenoxy 1 methylethylamino 3 4 isocarbostyriloxy 2 propanol, 2S, 1 S 1 2 o meth oxyphenoxy 1 methylethylamino 3 4 isocarbostyriloxyl 2 propanol, 2S, 1 R 1 2 o methoxyphenoxy 1 methyl ethylamino 3 4 isocarbostyriloxy 2 propanol, and 2R, 1 R 1 2 o methoxyphenoxy 1 methylethylamino 3 4 isocarbostyriloxy 2 propanol, respectively. There four optical isomers have different activities for their Î² adrenergic blocking effect and n adrenergic blocking effect and are expectable to be more valuable agent for therapeutic treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, as compared to an optically inactive racemic mixture of said isomer compounds. These four optical isomers may be produced and isolated from each other by chromatographing 1 S or 1 R N 2 o methoxyphenol 1 methylethyl 5 4 iso carbostyriloxymethyl 2 oxalidones to isolate either its 5R, 1 S isomer and its 5S, 1 S isomer, or its 55, 1 R isomer and its 5R, 1 R isomer therefrom separately, and then hydrolysing each of these isolated isomers under alkaline conditions to obtain separately 2R, 1 S , 2S, 1 S , 2S, 1 R and 2R, 1 R 1 2 methoxyphenoxy 1 methylethylamino 3 4 isocarbostyriloxy 2 propanols.
