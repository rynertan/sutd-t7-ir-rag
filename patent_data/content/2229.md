# Sheet feed apparatus.

## Abstract
A sheet feed apparatus for use with a copying machine comprises a sheet stacking means 100 for stacking recording sheets thereon, and a pair of sheet feed rollers 52, 60 for feeding the recording sheets one by one, which are arranged coaxially on a driving shaft 46 disposed on the sheet stacking means 100 , and one sheet feed roller 52 is located at an appropriate position and the other sheet feed roller 60 is movable along the driving shaft 46 . The sheet stacking means 100 can take two positions, a sheet feed position and a sheet replenishment position, by sliding the sheet stacking means 100 in and out of the body of the copying machine. When the sheet stacking means 100 is slided out of the body of the copying machine to the sheet replenishment position and recording sheets are stacked on the sheet stacking means 100 and then slided into the body of the copying machine, the position of the movable feed roller 60 is automatically determined appropriately in accordance with a partition plate which is to be set in accordance with the size of the recording sheets.
