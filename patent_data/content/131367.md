# Method of and apparatus for machining ceramic materials.

## Abstract
Efficient, high precision machining of ceramic materials is achieved by supplying on to a workpiece of a ceramic material a liquid electrolyte having components at least one of which is normally inert to but becomes chemically reactive with the ceramic material at an elevated temperature, and applying to a limited zone of interface between the liquid electrolyte and the workpiece, localized energy of a mag nitude sufficient to heat the liquid electrolyte and the ceramic material there to the elevated temperature and to remove from the workpiece the locally heated ceramic material in a form at least partially chemically degenerated with the at least one electrolytic component. The limited zone acquiring the localized energy is displaced in a scanning manner from one region to another on the workpiece along a programmed path to consecutively remove the ceramic material along the path from the workpiece.
