# Process for the preparation of cyclohexyl cyclohexanone.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for the preparation of cyclohexyl cyclohexanone CHA . Cyclohexanone is self condensed to yield a mixture of cyclohexylidene cyclohexanone CHDA , water, and unconverted cyclohexanone. The CHDA in the mixture is directly hydrogenated to CHA under an atmos phere of hydrogen and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, the presence of water and cyclohexanone not affecting the reaction. The CHA may be separated from the other compo nents by, for example, fractional distillation following the hydrogenation.
