# Superconducting device.

## Abstract
A superconducting device 9 including a superconduct ing coil is suitable for use in a nuclear magnetic resonance computer tomography NMR CT apparatus which requires a highly uniform, highly stable magnetostatic field. However, a serious problem arises when a large sized superconduct ing coil is to be installed in a small room of a hospital or the like. A superconducting device capable of solving this problem is disclosed in which a very low temperature vessel 1 having the form of a cylinder contains a superconducting coil in a state that the superconducting coil is immersed in a very low temperature coolant 12 , and a very low tempera ture coolant inlet port 6 communicating the very low temperature vessel 1 for introducing the very low tempera ture coolant into the very low temperature vessel 1 is provided along a radial direction perpendicular to the horizontal center axis of the superconducting device and inclined at a desired angle with a vertical direction. The above superconducting device can be installed in a small room of a hospital, and makes easy a very low temperature coolant introducing operation.
