# Ink jet printing apparatus having an ink pressure transient suppressor system.

## Abstract
An ink jet printer includes a compact ink drop generating module 10 comprising an ink jet print head 14 mounted to a body 12 which contains high and low frequency ink pressure transient suppressing mechanisms 90, 68, 80 . These mechanisms inhibit the ingestion of air into print head 14 and formation of print head clogging air bubbles. The body 12 also includes a purgable bubble trap 72 . Head 14 may be of the air assisted type. Air supplied to the head pressurizes ink at one side 82 of the diaphragm 80 and at the other side 84 of the diaphragm to increase the fluid capacitance of the diaphragm. The module 10 is easy to replace as a unit.
