# Electrodeposition of chromium and its alloys.

## Abstract
A process for electroplating chromium comprising pre treating the surface of a part to be plated with chromium by forming a deposit of a sulphur compound thereon, which sulphur compound accelerates the reduction of chromium ions to chromium metal. Preferably the deposit is formed cathodically in a solution containing a sulphur species. The sulphur species include thiocyanate, or species having S O or S S bonds or a species having a C S or C S group within the molecule. Alternatively the sulphur compound can be chemically deposited by evaporating sulphur on to the surface or by immersing the part in a solution of sulphide ions.
