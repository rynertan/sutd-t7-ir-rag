## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING DICHLOROSILANEThis invention relates to a process for producing dichlorosilane.The recent remarkable development of the electronics industry has brought about a rapid growth in the silicon industry for semiconductors. Equally, in view of the problem that fossil energy is being exhausted, utilization of the solar energy has been regarded as a pressing need, and thus the use of high purity metal silicon for solar electricity generation has been energetically studied.Heretofore, trichlorosilane has been mainly used as the raw material for high purity metal silicon for semiconductors, but utilization of dichlorosilane has recently been noted as a more economic process.Furthermore, it has been noted to use dichlorosilane as a raw material for epitaxial silicon and amorphous silicon. Thus, the advent of a cheap process for producing dichlorosilane has been desired. The past processes for producing dichlorosilane have been directed mainly to disproportionation processes.According to this process, however, 1,700 kg of tetrachlorosilane is byproduced in producing 1,000 kg of dichlorosilane. Conversion of such tetrachlorosilane into trichlorosilane requires high temperature and high pressure and hence it is uneconomical. Thus, a process for producing dichlorosilane directly from silicon has been noted. As such a process, USA Patent 2,499,009 discloses that silicon can be reacted with hydrogen chloride in the presence of copper as catalyst.However, the proportion of dichlorosilane produced is lower than that of trichlorosilane produced hence such a process is unsatisfactory.The object of the present invention is to improve the known process of reacting silicon with hydrogen chloride in the presence of copper as catalyst to increase the proportion of dichlorosilane which is produced.The present invention resides in a process of reacting silicon with hydrogen chloride in the presence of copper as catalyst, the improvement which comprises using a metal having a Pauling s electronegativity of 1.9 or more and or a nitrogen compound, with the copper. In order to make the reaction rate higher, it is preferred that silicon, copper and the other metal catalyst, if any, be in powdery or porous form and these components be sufficiently mixed with each other. For adequate mixing in this case, there may be employed a process of sufficiently mixing them in the form of powder as small as possible or a process of converting them into an alloy including the case of melt mixing and those obtained by thermal diffusion .As the metal used in the present invention and having aPauling s electronegativity of 1.9 or more, Ru, Os, Rh, Ir, Pt, Ag, Au, Bi, Te, Po, Tc and Re are exemplified, and mixtures thereof may be used. Among these metals,Ru. Os, Rh, Ag, Bi and Te are preferred.As the nitrogen compounds usable in the present invention, any of those containing nitrogen may be used and examples thereof are ammonia. ammonium salts, amines. salts thereof, nitro compounds, nitroso compounds, cyanides including nitriles and cyano complexes and metal nitrides such as Si NAs the nitrogen compoumds, those in liquid or solid form are preferred, and also those having a high proportion of nitrogen are preferred. Further, it is also preferred to sufficiently mix these nitrogen compounds with silicon and copper. The amounts of the catalyst components, i.e. the copper, the metal having a Pauling s electronegativity of 1.9 or more and the nitrogen compound used in the preesent process when based on 100 parts by weight of silicon may be about 1 to 100 parts by weight, about 0.1 to 20 parts by weight and about 1 to 100 parts by weight, respectively.In order to contact silicon and copper and other catalyst components with hydrogen chloride, the silicon, etc may be placed in an atmosphere of hydrogen chloride or hydrogen chloride diluted with an inert gas, or these gases may be passed through silicon, etc in contact therewith.The reaction temperature in the present invention is preferably in the range of about 200 to 4000C. If it is lower than 2000C, the reaction rate is small, and if it exceeds 4000C, there is a fear that dichlorosilane is decomposed.According to the present invention, it is possible to produce dichlorosilane directly from silicon and hydrogen chloride with a high yield hence the present invention has a great commercial meaning. The present invention will be further described by way of non limiting Examples and by way of reference toComparitive Examples.In the following, reference is made to the accompanying drawing which shows a flow sheet illustrating an apparatus employed in the Examples and ComparativeExamples.The drawing shows a reaction tube 1 with a layer of 2 of silicon and catalyst in an electric furnace 3 wose temperature is monitored with thermometer 4.
