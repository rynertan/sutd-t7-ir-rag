# Pouring tank transfer assembly.

## Abstract
A pouring tank transfer assembly comprises support tracks 10, 12, 22, 24 for respective transfer cars 20, 28 adapted to mount pouring tanks not shown filled with molten metal which thus can be rolled from respective loading stations 14, 26 to a pouring station 16 . The support tracks 10, 12, 22, 24 are of a double rail configuration and are at an acute angle to one another whose vertex is at the pouring station 16 . A third, guide rail 18, 30 extends parallel to each set of tracks 10, 12, 22, 24 . Each transfer car 20, 28 is equipped with flangeless wheels which roll along the transfer tracks, and has a support arm 52, 53 from which guide rollers extend. Such guide rollers contact the respec tive guide rail 18, 30 to provide lateral stability for each car 20, 28 .
