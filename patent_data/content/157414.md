# RANGE MEASUREMENT METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A passive range measurement device and method are described with utilizes a digitized image stream derived from images taken by a camera 10 which is also part of the device. The device also includes a digital processor 18 which operates on the image stream to extract the coefficients of an address modification function from which range to each point in the scene, relative camera scene, and camera platform orientations may be derived. The extraction process is based upon calculation of a vector field which describes the pixel to pixel misregistration between two mages. Improvements in the modification function are found from global, then localized averages of the vector field. Thus, a topographic map of the scene which is referenced to the position of the camera and platform is created, and may be used to create a terrain following capability.
