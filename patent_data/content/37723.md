# EXPRESSION OF HORMONE GENOMIC CLONES

## Abstract
Cloned DNA segments comprise a gene coding for a human polypeptide hormone and are derived from human genome and are capable of being expressed in a eucaryotic cell. The human polypeptide hormone may be human insulin. The cloned DNA segments may be comprised in a DNA trans fer vector.
