# Transfer, encapsulating, and fixing of toner images.

## Abstract
A method of transferring, encapsulating, and fixing dried liquid toner images in electrography is provided. Stable, abrasion resistant articles are disclosed which have a subs trate bearing a polymeric receptor coating, the receptor coating having encapsulated therein particles of substantial ly submicron size distributed in image wise fashion in a homogeneous continuum up to about eight particle diameters thick and having a resulting transmission optical density within the range of 0 to 4.0, the particles being encapsulated in the receptor coating so that at least 75 are not protruding from the surface of the coating.
