# UNIVERSAL GRIPPER APPARATUS FOR ROBOTIC DEVICE

## Abstract
A gripper apparatus is provided for use with a robotic device. The apparatus includes a plurality of master jaws pivotally mounted to a housing and radially aligned with respect to one another. Appropriately shaped grippers are mountable on each master jaw. Rotational movement of the master jaws is effected by an actuator piston slidably disposed within the housing. The actuator piston is moved in response to hydraulic or pneumatic fluid selectively directed into the housing.
