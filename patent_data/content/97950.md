## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION STABILIZED ASPARTAME COMPOSITION, A PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND AN AQUEOUS FOOD BACKGROUND OF TH2 INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to stabilized compositions of aspartame such as aqueous foods containing aspartame which contain a stabilizing agent which allows long term storage of the composition or food without significant deterioration of the aspartame.Description of the Prior Art Niith the recent increase in the consumption of low calorie beverages and health foods, a5partar, a low calorie sweetener offering an intense sweetness os very good quality, has come to be considered one of the best candidates for incorporation in such beverages and foods. But as is often pointed out, one great problem with storing aspartame c L as artyl L phenylalanine methyl ester in the presence of water is. that its quality is impaired during storage due to the 2H and temperature at which such foods and beverages are normally stored.In foods and beverages wherein both water and aspartame are present sunder weakly acidic or alkaline conditions, in foods and beverages containing aspartame together with a high water content irrespective of pH, or in foods and beverages which are manufactured, stored or distributed at high to medium temperatures while containing aspartame in the presence of water, the aspartame is partially decomposed to diketopiperazine, which is non toxic and perfectly safe but has no sweetness. This results in reduced sweetness of the food or beverage containing the aspartame.This decrease in the quality of aspartame in the presence of water during storage can be a barrier to its extensive use in sweet aqueous foods and beverages, such as soft drinks and juices, that currently use high volumes of sweeteners and potentially are a major market for low calorie sweeteners. Therefore, enhancing the storage stability of aspartame in water is very Important for expanding its use in processed foods. This demand has been partially met by storing aspartame at low temperatures and at a controlled 2E the aspartame is stable In a pH range of 4 to 4.5 , y adding a Ca or Mg ion releasing material Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 77569 75 , or by encapsu lating the aspartame Japanese Patent Application OPI . o. 202268 32 and Japanese Patent Publication No.53063 82 . However, none of these techniques are completely satisfactory since they cannot be applied to soft drinks and juices with sufficient ability to stabilize the aspartame contained therein. Furthermore, aspartame does not have sufficiently high dispersibility or solubility in water to be used as a table sweetener or an additive to processed foods as easily as sugar. One method conventionally used to improve the solubility properties of aspartame is to dry it together with an excipient highly soluble in water. The use of an excipient contributes to the improvement of the dispersibility and solubility of te aspartame, but in many cases, aspartame treated by this method does not become as stable in water as aspartame that is coated with water insoluble substances such as fats and oils.Therefore, no conventional technique Is ideal in that it cannot satisfy simultaneously the requirements of high storage stability and improved solubility and dispersibility which are generally incompatible with each other. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition containing aspartame which is stable toward long term storage in an aqueous environment. It Is a further object of this nvention to provide aspartame containing oods and beverages having a high water content which are stable during long erm storage. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method of producing compositions of the invention and foods and beverages of the invention which are stable during long term storage. These and other objects of the invention as will hereinafter become more readily apparent have been accomplished by providing a stabilized aspartame composition comprising aspartame and a sugar derivative selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins and sucrose fatty acid esters. BRIEF DESCRIPTION 0 THE DRAWINGS A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 shows the long term stability of aspartame in 1 aqueous solutions containing 18 of a sucrose fatty acid ester and 2 otherwise identical solutions containing no such ester and rIGtDE 2 shows the long term stability of asparta e in 1 aqueous solutions containing 3 of a sucrose fatty acid ester and 2 otherwise identical solutions containing no such ester. DESCRIPTION OF TEIE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the process of achieving the present invention, the present inventors made extensive studies to develop an aspartame composition which has improved stability in water as well as enhanced dispersibility and solubility and have found that the stability of aspartame in water can be improved by using it together with a cyclodextrin. The dispersibility and solubility of aspartame in water can also be enhanced by entrapping the aspartame in the cyclodextrin.Additional studies further demonstrated that the stability of aspartame in water can be further improved by Incorporating a sucrose fatty acid ester conventionally used as an edible surfactant into the aspartame composition, either alone or in combination with a cyclodetri. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to an aspartame composition which contains a cyclodextrin preferably in a molar ratio of 2CO 1 to 1 50 with respect to the aspartame as well as to an aqueous food or beverage that contains salc composition. The invention also relates to a process for producing te sweetener composition by mixing the aspartame with the cyclodextrin in the presence o, water and o,Evan aqueous solvent, optionally followed by ring of the mixture. he cyclodextrin used In the present invention hereafter abbreviated as CD is a cyclic oligosaccharide homolog that is also known as a cycloamylose. It consists of 6 to 10 D glucopyranose groups bonded through c 1,4 glucoside bonds to form a cyclic structure. It is named a CD, ss CD or y CD according to the degree of polymerization 6, 7 or 8 glucose units . The interior of the ring contains C H bonds or ether bonds and is hydrophobic, while the exterior of the ring is interspersed with OH groups and is highly hydrophilic. Because of this structure, CD is capable of entrapping various compounds in the interior of the cyclic molecule.Previousy, CD has been used in foods in order to mask a fishy smell in the protein processing industry , to prevent oxidation in the fat and oil processing industry , to preserve flavor in spices , and to prevent moisture absorption and deliquescence in sugared foods . CD is usually produced from stare by treating it ng with an amylase or a similar enzyme produced fre Bacillus macerans or an alkali resistant bacterium. There are no particular limitations on the CD that can be used in the present invention ith respect to the conditions for producing it or other factors.according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, o CD, S CD and gamma CD may be used ester independently or as a mixture, although tne intended object of the present invention can be achieved with any type of CD. The stability of aspartame in water can be improved by using CD in a trace amount in a molar ratio of 1 200. Using CD in an amount greater than 50 times the amount of aspartame is not only uneconomical, but it is also detrimental to the purpose of reducing the caloric content. Therefore, the practical acceptable molar ratio of aspartame to CD is in the range of from 200 1 to 1 50. The stability of aspartame in water can be improved by simply using it together with the CD, but for the purpose of improving its dispersibility and solubility in water in addition to its stability in water, it is preferred that at least a tart of The aspartame be entrapped in the CD. One particular useful application of this aspect of the invention is that it allows the preparation of an aspartame sweetener composition i.e., a composition intend Xor use by the ultimate consumer as a table sweetener.Thus the aspartame compositions containing a cyclodextrin, and particularly those in which aspartame Is entrapped within the cyclodextrin, have sutf c ent solubility and dispersibility that they may be used as table sweeteners, either in solid or liquid for. Any method can be used for entrapping the aspartame in the CD, and a tical method is descri for purposes of illustration. First, the aso artame s mixed with CD in the presence of water or an aqueous solvent such as aqueous alcohol. If desired, an excipient such as dextrin, sugar, sugar alcohol, polysaccharides, protein, amino acid, or salt or a flavor or any other quality modifier may also be used Water and other aqueous solvents may be used in any amount that enables the formation of the desired entrapped compound.However, if the mixture must be subsequently dried, water and other aqueous solvents should not be used in an amount greater than that necessary for forming a slurry or paste of the mixture of aspartame and CD e.g., 0.3 to 3 times the amount ofCD in order to avoid an increase in the energy cost and to prevent browning and the loss of the sweetness the aspartame due to extended drying at elevated temperatures.The resulting solution or slurry containing both the aspartame and CD is preferably heated to a temperature between about 30 and 90 C in order to increase the solubility of the aspartame andCD to such an extent that they can be dissolved in the least possible amount of water i.e., a uniform product is produced by using a minimum amount of water and the efficiency of the subsequent drying is increased . The aspartame may be added either as a mixture with CD or as a separately prepared solution or slurry of the aspartame. But apart from the case where the aspartame has been made easily soluble by using another excipient, the preparation of a separate solution or slurry of the aspartame is preferred in order to facilitate the subsequent step of dissolving the CD. The slurry is intimately mixed in a homogenizer, a kneader or the like for a period which generally ranges from about 30 minutes to a few hours. Mixing continues until the viscosity of the slurry is slightly increased to provide a pasty hydrous product wherein all or part of the aspartame is entrapped in the CD. When the mixture of aspartame and CD is a solution, it is stirred for a period of about 30 minutes to a few hours. In consequence, the greater part of the entrapped aspartame is obtained as a precipitate, which may be recovered by any suitable method such as removal of the solvent or recrystallization by cooling. Removal of the solvent is desirably effected by vacuum drying, by drying with dehumidified air, or by a similar method at low temperatures, preferably below 800C. Needless to say, the solution or slurry containing the aspartame and CD may be directly used as a liquid or pasty sweetener. The dried product also can be distributed as a sweetener after it is formed into a suitable shape, such as a powder, granules,tablets,or cubes,either independently or together with an excipient, a binder, etc. This sweetener having aspartame entrapped with CD shows a higher dispersibility and solubilitv of the aspartame in water than one having no entrapped aspartame that is pulverized, granulated or pelletized from a solution or a slurry of a simple mixture of the aspartame and CD. Thus this preferred dried product according to the present invention not only has high dispersibility and solubility in water but also has enhanced stability against storage in water, so it can be used advantageously as a sweetener for incorporation in processed foods and beverages or as a table sweetener. Another significant feature of the present invention is to provide fluid or semi fluid aqueous foods wherein the aspartame keeps its initial quality for an extended period. The stability of the quality of the aspartam can be improved without entrapping it in the CD.Furthermore, the amount of the CD added can be held to a minimum, so an aqueous food that has a very low calorie content and which can be stored for an extended period can be produced with high efficiency according to the present invention. To give a specific example, a beverage as sweet as an ordinary soft drink, for example, one containing 5 g of sucrose per 100 ml, can be offered by the present invention while reducing the calorie content to a negligible level, i.e., about 1 100 to 5 1,000 of the calorie content of the conventional soft drink. The present invention also includes compositions which contain, eIther alone or in combination with 2 cyclodextrin as described above, a sucrose fatty acid ester. Preferred aspects of this invention therefore relate to an aspartame containing aqueous food that contains 0.008 to 3 wtt of a sucrose fatty acid ester The term sucrose fatty acid ester as used in the present invention refers to an edible surfactant composed of sucrose and a fatty acid, many examples of which are known to the prior art for use in other methods and compositions.Numerous references are available which describe sucrose fatty acid esters and their production. These include Sucrose Ester ofFatty Acid Part 1 , Ishizuka et al., Journal of Food Industry, 14 1971 Sucrose Ester of Fatty Acid art 2 Fundamental Physiological 3rooerties , Watanase 2 al., Journal of Food Industry, 14 12 , 65 71 1971 Sucrose Ester of Fatty Acid Part 3 , watanace Journal of Food Industry, 14 16 , 105 111 1971 TheSurface Chemistry of Alkyl Esters of Sucrose , Osipow et al., J.A.U.C.S, 35, 127 129 1558 and DK Ester a monograph on sucrose fatty acid ester by DKS International, Inc. . Since sucrose fatty acid esters are digested in the human body and absorbed as sucrose along with a fatty acid, their se in foods is unlimited. The exact nature of these corpounds varies greatly according to the proportions of the fatty aclds e.g., stearic acid, palmitic acid, lauric a d and oleic acid used to form the ester. Any type can be used in the present invention and preferably it has an HLB value within the range of from 2 to 19. The sucrose fatty acid ester is preferably used in a concentration of 0.008 to 3 wt of the food in which it is incorporated. If the concentration of the sucrose fatty acid ester is less than 0.008 wt , its intended ability to stabilize aspartame is not achieved.There is no particular upper limit to the concentration of the sucrose fatty acid ester, but, organoleptically, it should not exceed 3 in terms of the concentration in the actual form of food intake this also applies to a concentrated food . More specifically, the range of 0.01 to 1 wt is optimum for enhancing the stability of aspartame in water without impairing the organoleptic characteristics of the food. As long as the concentration of the sucrose fatty acid ester is within the range of 0.008 to 3 wt , any other edible surfactant such as glycerol fatty acid ester,sorbitan fatty acid ester or soybean phospholipid may also be used in a concentration of about 0.005 to 1 . The sucrose fatty acid ester may be added by any method and at any time during preparation of the composition so long as it is uniformly dispersed or dissolved in the aqueous phase of the final product. However, if the aspartame is heated in the presence of water during food production or if there is the possibility of reduced aspartame stability due to the aging, it is more effective to add the sucrose fatty acid ester prior to or simultaneously with the aspartame. It is also desirable to incorporate either cyclodextrin as described above or a conventional agent capable of enhancing the stability of aspartame in water or to incorporate an agent to control the pH to be in a stable region for aspartame e.g., a pH lowering agent such as an organic acid or amino acid, a pH increasing agent, or a pH buffering agent . The compositions of the invention are suitable for use in any aqueous food to replace sugars normally used as sweeteners. The term aqueous foods as used ere refers to all foods except dried foods and oily foods, and includes beverages such as juice, cola, sports drinks i.e., isotonically balanced drinks , coffee, tea,cacao dairy milk, fruit flavored milk, coffeeflavored milk, soybean milk, conditioned soybean milk, flavored soybean milk, amazake sweet sake made from fermented rice , silko azuki soup with rice cake , ginger ale, milk shakes, tomato juice and other vegetable juices yogurt, jelly, Bavarian cream, pudding, and mousse sauces such as ketchup, mayonnaise, salad dressings, Worcester sauce, fruit flavored sauce, chocolate sauce, tomato sauce and chili sauce creams, toppings, fillings and jams frozen desserts such as ice creams and sherbets pickle syrups, and pickling syrup chewing gum, bean jellies, condensed milk, cooked beans and yokan Japanese sweet jelly of bean . The present invention is particularly effective for enhancing the stability of aspartame in the above named aqueous foods and beverages which are canned, bottled, pouched, packed or otherwise packed in manners suitable for shipping and display at room temperature or in a chilled state. A particularly preferred embodiment of the invention comprises fluid and semi fluid aqueous foods produced as described herein. The. term fluid aqueous foods as used herein refers to beverages such as those described above or other readily flowing compositions of high water content. The term semi fluid aqueous foods11 as used herein refers to viscous flowable foods, optionally containing solids, such as yogurt, jelly,Bavarian cream, pudding, ketchup, mayonnaise, salad dressings, chocolate sauce, tomato sauce, and similar items. The invention is of particular relevance to these fluid and semi fluid aqueous foods because of the high water content of these foods, which normally contributes to rapid degradation of aspartame. There is no particular limitation on the concentration of aspartame in these foods, and the concentration may be properly determined according to the sweetness of the aqueous food in which the aspartame is to be used. Needless to say, the aspartame may be used together with known natural sweeteners such as sucrose, saccharides, sugar alcohol and stevioside, as well as with artifical sweeteners such as saccharin. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified. In the examples, all percentages and parts are by weight. Example 1 Aqueous solutions containing aspartame and CD in the amounts indicated in Table 1 were prepared. As a control, an aqueous solution containing only aspartame was prepared. All samples were stored at 24 C to check the long term stability of aspartame. Table 1 Sample ccmósition percent residual aspartame conc. of conc. of stored at 240C aspartame D mole 1,000 ml mole 1,000 ml 18 days 45 days 1 0.365 0 92.8 80.0 2 0.365 0.002 93.5 81.8 3 0.365 0.012 94.0 83.0 4 0.365 0.023 97.9 87.1 5 0.365 0.083 99.0 88.6 The table shows that the long term stability of the aspartame could be improved by using B CD in a low concentration which was only about five thousandths of a mole with respect to one mole of the aspartame. The aspartame mixed with ss CD in a molar ratio of about 1 5 underwent little decomposition when it was stored at 24 C for 18 days. Example 2 Cyclo TC is the trade name for a cyclodextrin manufactured by Toyo Jozo Co., Ltd., with a cyclodextrin formulation of 30 a CD and 50 total CD. Cyclo TC 30 parts was mixed with water 90 parts to form a slurry, to which was added a wet cake prepared by mixing aspartame 1Q0 parts with water 30 parts .While retained at 35 5 C, the mixture was agitated in a kneader for one hour. The resulting hydros mixture was vacuum dried at 40 50 C and ground with a speed mill to produce a particulate compound wherein the aspartame was entrapped in Cyclo TC water content 3.5 , particle size 330 Wm in 50 . The solubility of the so prepared sample of the present invention was compared with that of a control sample which consisted of only bulk aspartame. The results are shown in Table 2 from which one can see that the dispersibility of the aspartame in water can be increased by entrapping it in the cyclodextrin, as evidenced by a shorter time required for dissolving the sample of the present invention in water 1 3 to 1 5 of the time necessary for dissolving the control sample .

Example 3 Celdex is the trade name for a a cyclodextrin manufactured by Japan Maize Products Co., Ltd. Celdex N 100 parts was mixed with water 200 parts to orm a slurry, to which was added a wet cake prepared 5 mixing aspartame 200 parts with water 60 parts .The mixture was processed as in Example 2 to prepare a particulate compound wherein the aspartame was entrapped in CD The solubility of the so prepared sample of the present invention was compared with that of a control sample which consisted of only bulk aspartame. The results are shown in Table 3, from which one can see that the water solubility of the aspartame entrapped inCD was higher than that of the untrapped aspartame by about 24 at SOC and 10 at 250C .

Control No. 1 was prepared from a mixture of aspartame 1.3 parts , Celdex N 0.7 part and sucrose 198 parts by the same method. Control No. 2 consisting of only bulk aspartame was also prepared.The dispersibility, dissolution rate, and aspartame stability against storage at 24or were checked for each sample. The results are shown in Table 4.

As Table 4 shows, the granular sweetener of the present invention could be dissolved in water in a period which was only 1 3 to 1 26 of the time necessary for dissolving the controls wherein the aspartame was not entrapped in CD furthermore, the storage stability of the sample of the present invention was 5 to 20 higher than that of the controls. Example 5 Water 75 parts was added to Cyclo TC 30 parts , and the mixture was heated at 40 C. Then, a slurry prepared by adding aspartame 30 parts to water 300 C was added to the mixture. The resulting mixture was kneaded as in Example 1 to prepare a paste, which was dissolved under stirring in a mixture of a strawberry flavor 0.15 part , citric acid 0.3 part and water 35 part to provide a strawberry syrup pH 4.2 . The syrup was stored in an incubator 15 C for 60 days. The decomposition of the aspartame was negligible and its residual content was as high as 99.5 . In an organoleptic test, the number of the panelists who liked the flavor of a sample of the present invention was significantly larger than that of those who liked the flavor of a strawberry syrup having the same degree of sweetness. Example 6 To 500 ml of Coca Cola manufactured by Fuji CocaCola Bottling Co., Ltd. , 0.35 g of the aspartameentrapped compound prepared in Example 2 was added.The mixture was rebottled and sterilized by heating in water 80 C for 20 minutes to prepare an aspartamecontaining Coca Cola. A control Coca Cola containing 0.27 g of bulk aspartame was prepared by the same method. The two Coke samples were stored in an incubator 240C for 45 days. The sample having the aspartame entrapped in CD retainined 87.2 of the residual aspartame, which was about 10 higher than the percent residual aspartame in the control 79.8 . In an organoleptic test, the Coke sample having the aspartame entrapped in CD was found to have a more intense sweetness of better quality than the control. Example 7 To 500 ml of commercial orange juice manufactured by Pocca Lemon Co., Ltd. , 0.53 g of the aspartameentrapped compound prepared in Example 1 was added.The mixture was bottled and sterilized by heating in water 800C for 20 minutes to prepare an aspartame containing orange juice. A control orange juice containing 0.41 g of bulk aspartame was prepared by the same method. The two orange juice samples were stored in an incubator 24 C for 45 days. The sample having the aspartame entrapped in CD retained 86.3 of the residual aspartame, which was about 8 higher than the percent residual aspartame in the control 79.28 . In an oraganoleptic test, the orange juice sample having the aspartame entrapped in CD was found to have a more intense sweetness of better quality and was more flavcrful than the control. Example 8 A solution of 1 of sucrose fatty acid ester product of Dai Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd. in 0.93 aqueous aspartame was put in 150 ml bottles, and heated at 80 C for 30 minutes. The bottles were then held in an incubator 44 C for defined periods to determine the long term stability of the aspartame. As controls, aqueous aspartame solutions containing no sucrose fatty acid ester were prepared. The solutions in both the test group and the control group had a pH of 6.2. The time dependent change in the residual aspartame is shown in FIGURE 1, from which one can see that in the test group containing 1 of the sucrose fatty acid ester, 70 of the aspartame remained intact even after 30 days, but in the control group, almost all aspartame was lost in 5 days. Example 9 A solution of 3 of sucrose fatty acid ester product of Dai Ichi Kogyo Seiyaku Co., Ltd. in 0.82 aqueous aspartame was distributed among 150 ml bottles, and heated at 80 C for 30 minutes. The bottles were ten held in an incubator 44 C for defined periods to check the long term stability of aspartame. As controls, aqueous aspartame solutions containing no sucrose fatty acid ester were prepared. The solutions in both the test group and the control group had a pS of 6.5. The time dependent change in the residual aspartame is shown in FIGURE 2, from which one can see that in the test group containing 3 of the sucrose fatty acid ester, at least 40 of the aspartame remained intact even after 30 days, but in the control group, almost all aspartame was lost in 2.5 days.

They were also stored at room temperature for 3 months to examine the stability of the aspartame. The results are shown in Table 5 below.

The effectiveness of the fatty acid ester was particularly significant during storage. Example 11 A mixture of aspartame 0.6 g , citric acid 0.25 g , 85 phosphoric acid 0.3 g , caramel 4 g , sodium citrate 0.L g and distilled water 150 ml was heated to form a solution. To the solution was added 0.1 g of green leaves extract that had been dissolved in 25 ml of distilled water by heating. The resulting mixture was cooled in ice water and blended with 1 ml of a flavor mix consisting of 0.5 mg of cola essence W4723 by Takasago Perfumery Co., L.a. , 0.23 ml of vanilla extract and 0.25 ml of cola nut extract. To the mixture, 800 ml of cold carbonated water was added to make a total volume of 1,000 ml. The resulting solution was equally distributed among four bottles.During the preparation of these colas, samples of sucrose fatty acid ester product by Dai Ichi KogyoSeiyaku Co., Ltd. were added in concentrations of 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.10 and 1.00 . The long term stability of aspartame in the test cola preparations was compared with that of controls having no sucrose fatty acid ester. The results are shown in Table 6 below, from which one can see that the stability of the aspartame in cola was improved by adding the sucrose fatty acid ester, and its effectiveness was increased as more sucrose fatty acid ester was used.

To 400 g of the concentrate, 1.7 of aspartame and 330 g of SE 130 a reduced starch hydrolyzate of Matsu,anL Kagaku Kogyo Kaisha Ltd. were added, and the mixture was cooled to cause the crystallization of lactose at a controlled rate. The cooled mixture was packed in cans. During the preparation of these sugared condensed whole milk samples, a sucrose fatty acid ester was added simultaneously with the addition of the aspartame so that the final concentrations of the ester in the final product were 0.5 , 1.0 and 3.0 , respectively.The long term stability of aspartame in the test samples were compared with that of controls having no sucrose fatty acid ester. The results are shown inTable 7.

Example 13 A measured amount 250 g of the pulp of mandarin oranges was prepared by a conventional method and packed in each of six No. 5 cans, which were also filled with 67 g of syrup samples having the formulations indicated below. The cans were sealed with an automatic vacuum curler and the contents were sterilized at 80 850C center temperature 72 73 C for 12 minutes and cooled.

They were stored in the respective baths for 3 months to check the long term stability of the aspartame. The results are shown in Table 8, from which one can see that the stability of aspartame could be greatly improved by adding the sucrose fatty acid ester. The effectiveness of the ester was enhanced as its amount was increased, but in the storage at 400 C, the addition of 0.03 ester was sufficient to give a residual aspartame content at least twice the level achieved in the absence of the ester.

A 3.5 g portion of the premix was dissolved into 1000 ml of distilled water, and the solution was adjusted to pH 3.0 by an addition of citric acid solution concentration of 20 and packed in bottles. The bottled solution was heated at 800C for 30 minutes and placed in a constant temperature bath at 440C for 30 days for the purpose of measuring storage stability of aspartame. As a control, an aspartame solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of aspartame into 1000 ml of distilled water was used. The results of the time dependent change in percent residual aspartame content are shown in Table 9, from which one can see that the storage stability of aspartame could be greatly improved by the addition of sucrose fatty acid ester over the control. That is, the sample containing the sucrose fatty acid ester retained more than 90 of the residual aspartame and a loss of sweetness could not be perceived for the sample in an organoleptic test, while the control for which a loss of sweetness could clearly be perceived in the test, retained about 40 of the residual aspartame. In addition, the sample of the invention showed a great improvement in solubility and wettability of aspartame over the control.
