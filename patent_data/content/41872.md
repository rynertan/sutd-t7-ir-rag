# Phase difference compensation between separately recorded luminance and chrominance signals.

## Abstract
Luminance and chrominance signals, which are inter leaved with respective synchronization signals, are recorded through the use of two video transducer heads 9, 9 , 20, 20 alternately in skewed separate tracks of a recording tape. Upon reproduction, the timing signals are separated from the luminance and chrominance signals and compared in phase by a comparator 60, 110 to detect the phase difference bet ween the luminance and chrominance signals. A variable delay line 80I, 80Q 105, 106 is provided to introduce a vari able delay interval as a function of the detected phase differ ence to the one of the signals which is advanced in phase relative to the other. The time axis deviation of the video signal from a standard phase is also detected by a second phase comparator 101 which makes a comparison between the time base, or horizontal sync pulse, and a reference time base to introduce a delay time to both the luminance and chrominance signals.
