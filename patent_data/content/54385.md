# Xylene isomerization.

## Abstract
Reduced downgrading in xylene isomerization of ethyl benzene depleted feeds is achieved by carrying the process out over gallosilicate or borosilicate zeolites, preferably in the form of compositions comprising a core of catalytically inactive crystalline silica with an overlying zeolite layer. The composites are prepared by introducing preformed silica particles, preferably with a crystallite size greater than 0.1 µ, into a reaction mixture comprising a silicon source, a source of the modifying element, and preferably an organic tem plate such as tetraalkylammonium compound. The weight ratio of the silica core to SiO₂ in the reaction mixture is preferably 0.5 1 to 25 1.
