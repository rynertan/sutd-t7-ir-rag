# FORCE RESPONSIVE SWITCH

## Abstract
In response to a deceleration force, a rapidly reacting magnetic system causes a switch to change state. A prede termined time after the force ceases, a second, relatively slowly reacting magnetic system causes the switch to return to its original state. In a preferred ambodiment each magnetic system may include a fixed magnet and a magnet movable within a recess. A reed switch situated in a housing proximate the recesses is controlled by the positions of the movable magnets. The recess through which the movable magnet of the slowly reacting system moves contains a fluid. This magnet carries a pair of self positioning members which cooperate with the fluid to regulate the speed of the movement of the ma gnet within the recess, in accordance with its direction of movement, such that the slowly reacting system maintains the switch in the changed state and, thereafter, returns to its original state.
