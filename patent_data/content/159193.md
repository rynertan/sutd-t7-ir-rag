## Description
PLANTING APPARATUSThis invention relates to planting apparatus and in particular to apparatus for depositing seedlings in a furrow and closing the soil of the furrow over the roots thereof.Many crops are started in nurseries under controlled conditions and are then transplanted as seedlings into fields where the plants reach maturity for cropping.With such crops grown on a commercial scale it is necessary to transplant large numbers of such seedlings in a short period of time if the growth cycle is not to be interrupted.Various forms of planting apparatus are available which can perform this operation but most suffer from the drawbacks that they are complicated, and therefore expensive, and many will only cope with one particular type of seedling.The invention seeks to provide a simple and inexpensive planting apparatas which is versatile in application. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a planting apparatus which comprises a frame including a pair of inclined rear wheels and a furrow opening plough, the apparatus being adapted to be towed such that the plough opens a furrow and the wheels thereafter close it, the frame carrying a plurality of turrets adapted to contain seedlings arranged on a rotatable carousel over a chute communicating with the trailing portion of a furrow opening plough, the chute being arranged for reciprocation from within the trailing portion of the plough to a position close to the inclined wheels, the turrets being arranged so as to open in timed relationship with the movement of the chute to deposit a seedling into the chute when the latter is at or close to its most advanced position.The reciprocation of the chute pushes a seedling placed therein into the furrow formed by the plough and supports it in the furrow while the inclined rear wheels close the furrow over the roots thereof. The chute then retracts to is seedling receiving positio n to receive the next successive seedling and the operation is repeated. The rotation of the carousel is timed so that each successive turret moves over the chute and opens to allow the seedling to fall into the chute when the chute is at its most advanced position within the trailing portion of the furrow opening plough. The chute is preferably driven from a common gearbox with the turrets so as to ensure the correct timed relationship.Each turret is preferably arranged to open by having a hinged bottom portion which is supported on one or more frame members while the carousel is rotated, except in the area over the chute at which position the hinged bottom falls open allowing the seedling to be deposited into the chute.This invention also seeks to provide an improved form of chute for use with the above planter which provides adequate support for the seedling before the latter is pushed into the furrow and yet does not foul the foliage thereof.In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is provided aplanting apparatus which comprises a frame including a pair of inclined rear wheels and a furrow opening plough, the apparatus being adapted to be towed such that the plough opens a furrow and the wheels thereafter close it, the frame carrying means for successively supplying seedlings to a chute communicating with the trailing portion of the furrow opening plough, the chute being arranged for reciprocation from within the trailing portion of the plough to a position close to the inclined wheels and having a lid biased towards a closed position when the chute is at its most advanced position and arranged to open in timed relationship with the movement of the chute so as to clear the foliage of a seedling when the chute is at or close to its most rearward position at which the seedling is deposited into the furrow.The chute will generally be enclosed on three sides and be open on the fourth side facing rearwardly towards the inclined wheels. The lid is preferably pivotally attached toward the upper portion of the chute so as to cover the rearwardly facing open face of the chute when the latter is in its most retracted position that is within the trailing portion of the plough . This is the point at which a seedling will be dropped into the chute from the means supplying seedlings, for example a series of turrets on a carousel as described hereinafter. As the chute reciprocates rearwardly toward the position close to the inclined wheels the lid is pivoted open by means of, for example, an actuating rod coming into contact with a bar fixed to the frame. The degree to which the lid is opened may be adjusted by adjusting the position of the bar affixed to the frame.It is preferred that the drive for the chute and for the means for supplying seedlings to the chute is independent of the wheels of the apparatus so as not to act as a drag thereon, and will preferably be supplied from a suitable power take off, for example of the towing vehicle. This also has the added advantage that by adjusting the rate of drive supplied, the planting rate can be altered independently of the speed of towing.By simply replacing the reciprocating chute with one of a different configuration, the apparatus of the invention can simply be adapted for use for different types of seedling an is therefore extremely versatile as well as being simple in construction and economical to produce.The invention will be described further, by way of example, ith reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a partial diagrammatic elevational view of an apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention Figure 2A is a detail view of the carousel drive arrangement Figure 2B illustrates the opening of the turrets Figure 3 illustrates the chute from one side andFigure 4 illustrates the chute from the other side.Referring to the drawings, planting apparatus generally designated 10 comprises a main frame 12 having a pair of mutually inwardly inclined rear wheels 14 attached thereto by means of an axle 16. Depending from the frame 12 by means of a suitable support member 18 is a furrow opening plough 20 shown in Figure lb as viewed in the direction of arrow A in Figure la which comprises two side walls 22 as joined at the leading edge to resemble the bow of a ship The plough 20 is open at its trailing portion 24.Within the trailing portion 24 of the plough 20 is positioned a chute 26 which is pivotally attached to the apparatus at 28 and may be reciprocated by means of a connecting rod 30, as hereinafter will be described, from the position shown at 26 in Figure l to the position shown at 26a. A number of plant receiving turrets 32, in this case four, are arranged on a carousel 34 which is rotated by an axle 36 of an angle gear box 38. The gear box 38 is driven via a shaft connected to its input shaft 40, for eample from the power take off of the towing tractor. The gear box 38 is provided with an external drive gear 42 which in turn drives a gear 44 having an eccentric 46 mounted thereon and thereby imparting a reciprocal drive to he connecting rod 30. The ratio between the gears 42 an 44 will depend on the number of turrets on the carousel. In the present case there being four turrets 32,the ratio of the gear 42 to that of the gear 44 is 4 1 so that the rod 30 completes four cycles for every revolution of the carousel 34. Figure 2B illustrates a turret 32 as it revolves on the carousel 34 over the chute 26. The turret 32 has a base 4 hinged at 50 which is held in the closed position by frame members 52. In the area above the chute 26 there are no frame members and, as the turret moves from the position illustrated at a to that illustrated in b the base 48 swings open to the position shown at c allowing seedling 54 contained therein to drop into the chute and come to rest in the plough 20 at the position shown in figure la, where the chute is at its most advanced position.As the apparatus continues to be driven, the turret base 48 contacts a further frame member 56 which closes it again to receive a further seedling, and the chute is moved from the position 26 to the position 26a by the connecting rod 30. This pushes the plant 54 into the furrow formed by the plough 20 immediately before the furrow is closed by the inwardly inclined wheels 14 in a manner known per se.The chute 26 is provided with a lid 60 pivotally mounted thereto at 62 and, in the postion indicated at a inFigure 3 closing the open rearwardly directed face 64 of the chute 26. This is the position that corresponds to that illustrated at 26 in figure 1, that is with the chute at its most advanced position. It is at or close to this point that the seedling 54 is dropped into the chute from one of the turrets 32. Attached to the lid 60 about the pivot 62 is a cranked bar 66 which cooperates with a laterally directed rod 68 fixed to an actuating bar 70.The bar 70 is fixed to the frame 12 of the planter by means of a screw and slot arrangement 72 so that the position of the bar 70, and therefore the rod 68, is adjustable.As the chute 26 reciprocates to the left as viewed in figure 3 that is towards the position 26a in figure 1 the rod 68 bears against the bar 66 causing the lid 60 to pivot open, that is from the position shown at a in figure 3 towards the position shown in b in figure 3.The degree of opening can be adjusted by adjusting the actuating bar 70. The lid 60 is biased towards its closed position, that is the position illustrated at a , by means of a spring 74 or other resilient member also connected between the lid 60 and the frame 12. The size of the lid is such that at its fully open position b it would easily clear the foliage of a plant or seedling 54 contained within the chute 26. On the other hand in the closed postion a the seedling 54 is supported on all sides, including the rearwardly facing side of the chute 26 and cannot therefore fall over or otherwise become disoriented before planting. The apparatus will normally have a seat for an operative supported on the frame 12 and, conveniently located adjacent thereto, a plant receiving tray containing a large number of seedlings to be transplanted. The operative will load the seedlings into the turrets 32 immediately after each has deposited the previous seedling and its base has returned once again to the closed position. In an alternative form of carousel, the turrets 32 may take the form of side opening receptacles, in some ways similar to the chute 26. Instead of there being a separate base, one side wall is hinged at or near the top of the receptacle and is spring biassed in towards the opposite side wall. An actuating rod or lever may be attached to this side wall and may be cammed out by suitably placed fixed cams at or near the feed station. Such an arrangemen is described in our co pending European applicaton ref P44094 . Additionally, the plough 20 may be adjustable.The apparatus according to the invention is very reliable in operation and yet remains economical and uncomplicated as well as being versatile in operation.
