# Case stay.

## Abstract
A stay for controlling the extent of opening and the rate of closing a case is disclosed which is intended to be less prone to damaging the contents of the case and accidental injury to fingers of the user. A first version includes a flat, plate like member 14 or resilient synthetic plastic having one end 15 pivotally connected to a stud 24 affixed to the inner end wall surface of one luggage shell 12 . One of a pair of elongate, parallel curved slots 19 and 20 formed in the plate 14 is received onto a second stud 27 affixed to the other luggage part 11 such that when the two luggage parts are opened or closed on each other, the stud 27 will slide along and be guided by the slot 19 . The second stud 27 has cross sectional dimensions larger than the width of the slot 19 which distends the plastic material 22 between the two slots 19 and 20 producing a resilient clamping action on the stud 27 . A second version includes a metal plate 32 with an end 33 pivotally connected to a stud 42 on the inner surface of one shell 12 . A slot 37 in the plate 32 is received onto a stud 43 on the other luggage shell 11 such that the stud will slide along and be guided by the slot 37 . A thickened ear 40 is located immediately adjacent the slot 37 as a stop. A spring 48 and washer 47 on the stud 43 exert transverse pressure on the plate 32 as the stud 43 moves along the slot 37 deterring any tendency for the case parts to slam together.
