# Apparatus for and a method of deploying wires.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a roller 25 and a templet 6 having a working surface 8 with wire deploying grooves 26 therein, extending from a wire staging surface 14 . The roller 25 can be advanced towards one end 12 of the templet 6 to roll each of wires 2 into one of the grooves 26 . In order to improve the ease with which the wires 2 can be positioned in the grooves 26 , the grooves 26 originate at distances from the staging surface 14 which progressively increase laterally of the rolling direction, whereby an outermost wire 2 first positioned in a groove 26 acts as a stop for positioning the next outermost wire 2 in its groove.
