## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM UTILIZING THERMOSETTINGGELSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A goal of pharmaceutics is to efficiently deliver a therapeutic drug to a patient by administering it to a body cavity, by, topical, injectable or ophthalmic administration to the site of action. Over the years, numerous methods have been developed in an attempt to either develop a new method or improve the conventional method in achieving this goal. A major loss of drugs administered to the eye is via the lacrimal drainage system so that only a small fraction of the dose remains in the eye for an extended period of time from a liquid drop formulation. Different approaches have been taken to slow down this rapid loss of drug by using viscous solutions, gels, ointments and solid inserts. Improvement in drug delivery has been achieved by these methods especially with the use of solid inserts where a large reduction in dose is possible while achieving the same therapeutic response as a liquid drop which must be administered more frequently and at higher drug concentration. A principal advantage of the ophthalmic mode of administration is that it permits the accurate, reproducible unit dosing of a drug or active entity by using volumetric fluid delivery of the dosage prescribed while effecting the ultimate delivery of a semi solid or rigid gel state. Conventionally, it is not possible to deliver preformed gels from multiple dose containers readily by volumetric means.Gravimetric dosing is thus required to achieve uniform content in delivering reproducible quantities. Conventionally, voids and packing or consolidation problems result when administering semi solid preparations volumetrically. The present ophthalmic mode of administration provides extremely accurate and uniform content of dose which is critical for many potent drugs. A significant disadvantage to a solid insert however is that many patients have a difficult time inserting a solid object into the cul de sac of the eye and removing said solid object. We describe here a unique drug delivery system which at room temperature and lower has the property of a liquid but when administered topically to the skin becomes a semi solid or gel when warmed by the body. The advantages of such a system for application to the skin are 1 the drug delivery system can be applied to tender, sensitive skin by a pour on application with no need to rub the area to obtain coverage, and 2 a liquid will flow into crevices and pores providing intimate contact with the skin. When gelled, the drug delivery system remains in place with a flexible covering to the area of skin on which it is applied. Drugs are delivered to the skin from the gel but these drugs can also be removed by running cool water over the area. Such a drug delivery system will have application especially for burn patients where application and removal of drugs require gentle techniques because of the tender surface to which application is to be made. Another approach to these problems is to use a formulation which is a liquid at room temperature but which forms a semi solid when warmed to body temperatures. Such a system has been described inU.S. Patent No. 4,138,373 using PluronicQpolyols as the thermally gelling polymer. In this system the concentration of polymer is adjusted to give the desired sol gel transition temperature, that is lower concentration of polymer gives a higher solution gel sol gel transition temperature. However with the currently commercially available Pluronic polymers the ability to obtain a gel of the desired rigidity is limited while maintaining the desired sol gel transition temperature at physiologically useful temperature ranges near 26 35 C. Similarly Canadian patent 1072413 which relates to poloxamer gel systems with gelling temperatures higher than room temperature uses additives to bring about the gelling characteristics of the polymer which contains therapeutic or other type agents. Also in this Canadian patent Tetronics polymers are used as additive agents rather than the primary polymeric agent as in the instant case.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a pharmaceutical vehicle which is useful in delivering pharmacologically active medicaments to a body orifice such as the rectum, vagina, urethra, external auditory meatus, nasal passage or buccal or oral cavity by injecting into the patient s body human and animal via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection to the skin of a patient human and animal for topical, dermal and or transdermal delivery ofcandidatedrugs and to the eye and in some cases as in dry eye using the vehicle alone.The drug delivery system consists of a clear physiologically acceptable liquid which forms a semi solid gel at human body temperatures. The sol gel transition temperature and rigidity of the gel can be modified by changes in polymer concentration combined with the pH and ionic strength of the solution. We describe herein a unique drug delivery system which at room temperature has the properties of a liquid, but when administered by injection subcutaneously or intramuscularly , topically, rectally, nasally, vaginally or optically or to the oral cavity, buccal pouch or urethral lumen, changes to a semi solid or gel when warmed by the body. The advantages of such a system are the convenience of handling a liquid during the administration phase including the property of a liquid to make intimate contact before gel formation and after gelling prolonging the release time of the drug at the site of administration thereby resulting in a reduced therapeutic effective amount of said drug being administered.The gelling characteristics of this system also enhance the retention of product formulations within body cavities or lumens which might normally be rapidly depleted if dosed exclusively as liquids. The injection formulation when administered as a liquid will flow within soft tissue and after gelling will respond as a deformable gel so as to minimize much of the discomfort associated with solids injection and encapsulation. The gelled injection site may also serve as a drug depot location. The dose sparing ability of such a drug delivery system is realized when serious side effects of some drugs are reduced. The drug delivery system consists of a clear physiologically acceptable liquid which forms a semi solid or gel at body temperature. The unique gelling characteristics of the various formulations permit retention of the system at skin interfaces which might otherwise be rapidly depleted of liquid drug delivery systems in areas such as between fingers or toes, in groin areas, under breasts or arms or on the scalp. The sol gel transition temperature and rigidity of the gel can be modified by changes in polymer concentration combined with the pH and ionic strength of the solution. It has been discovered that certain polymers are useful vehicles having the properties set forth above. The polymers are tetra substituted derivatives of ethylene diamine poloxamine, w 2 inFormula I , propylene diamine w 3 , butylene diamine w 4 , pentylene diamine w 5 or hexylene diamine w 6 . The substituents are block copolymers of poly oxypropylene and poly oxyethylene of various chain lengths and ratios x to y in the general formula of the polymer shown below.EMI6.1 Formula I wherein w is an integer from 2 through 6. A typical polymer system of our invention would contain a polymer containing approximately 40 to 80 poly oxyethylene and approximately 20 to 60 poly oxypropylene . The total molecular weight of the polymer used in our invention is at a minimum about 7,000 and can go as high as 50,000 but preferably. is in the range of 7,000 to 30,000 and x and y are any integers within the above constraints.Preferred polymers are those of the formula above where w 2, namely the poloxamine polymer. The aqueous drug delivery vehicle would contain from 10 to 50 by weight of the entire vehicle as polymer described above. The aqueous drug delivery vehicle would also contain the drug or therapeutic agent in addition to various additives such as acids or bases to adjust the pH of the composition, buffers to maintain the pH, preservatives to control bacterial contamination, other additives to provide for drug solubility and stability and formulation performance with purified water making up the remainder of the drug delivery vehicle.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention consists of a pharmaceutical composition or drug delivery system which is a clear physiological acceptable solution at room temperature or lower but which forms a semi solid or gel when placed in the eye. The unique feature of this system is that both the gel transition temperature and or the rigidity of the gel can be modified by adjustment of the pH and or ionic strength and polymer concentration. The ability to change the sol gel transition temperature by pH adjustment is a critical feature of the invention which overcomes many of the disadvantages of previous approaches. Also the sol gel transition temperature can be modified somewhat by ionic strength adjustment. An example of a drug delivery vehicle in accordance with this invention consists of an aqueous solution of, for example, a tetra substituted ethylene diamine block copolymer of poly oxyethylene poly oxypropylene where w 2 in Formula I in which the substitution at the nitrogen is to the poly oxypropylene block and the polymer consists of about 40 80 as the poly oxyethylene unit and about 20 60 as the polypropylene unit and which has a total average molecular weight of 7,000 to 50,000 with a preferred range of 7,000 30,000. Such polymers are included in the polymers sold under the trademark TetronicX polyols by BASF Wyandotte Corporation. Other polymers where w 3 to 6 of Formula I can be made according to methods known in the art Block and Graft Copolymerization, Vol. 2 edited byR.J. Ceresa published by John Wiley and Sons, 1976 by using the appropriate initiators such as for example propylenediamine, butylenediamine, pentylenediamine and hexylenediamine. The preferred polymers are those which form gels at a concentration range of 10 to 50 of the polymer to water. A good example of a typical polymer used in the drug delivery system of our invention is TetronicX 1307 which thermally gels over a concentration range of about 15 to 35 in water with gelling temperatures of about 300C to IOOC at neutral pH. The gel strength at 358 concentration is much more rigid than at the 15 ael concentration.However, with a solution gel transition temperature of about 100C for the 35 solution any useful liquid product would have to be refrigerated below this temperature. A useful vehicle can be prepared however by modification of both concentration and pH. For example a 27 TetronicX 1307 solution at neutral pH has a gel sol transition temperature of about 160C but at pH 4 adjusted to such with HC1 at 100C the transition temperature is about 25 C. The gel formed under these conditions meets the requirements of a fairly rigid gel which is a liquid at room temperature. The effect of pH and polymer concentration on gelling temperature for Tetroni1307 is shown in Fig. 1. Thus, for example, at a concentration of polymer to water of 25 the gelling temperature is 190C at pH 6 and increases to 260C at pH 4. For administration of the drug delivery system of our invention to various body cavities, that is to the rectum, urethra, nasal cavity, vagina, auditory meatus, oral cavity or buccal pouch by injection either subcutaneously or intramuscularly by application to the skin and application to the eye as drops, the pH of the system can range from 2 to 9 with the preferred pH range being 4 to 8. The pH, concentration and gelling temperatures will vary for any individual polymer falling within the class covered in this invention and these factors can be determined by those skilled in the art in possession of this concept. The pH of the drug delivery system is adjusted by adding the appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to obtain the required pH. The acid or base can be any that are known to persons skilled in the art but are preferably hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. In general the drug delivery vehicle of the present invention will contain from about 0.01 to about 5 of the medicament or pharmaceutical, from about 10 to about 50 of the polymer and from 90 to about 45 water. In special situations, however, the amounts may be varied to increase or decrease the dosage schedule. If desired, the drug delivery vehicle may also contain, in addition to the medicament, buffering agents and preservatives. Suitable water soluble preservatives which may be employed in the drug delivery vehicle are sodium bisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, ascorbate, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric borate, parabens, benzyl alcohol and phenylethanol. These agents may be present in amounts of from 0.001 to 5 by weight and preferably 0.01 to 2 . Suitable water soluble buffering agents are alkali or alkali earth carbonates, phosphates, bicarbonates, citrates, borates, acetates, succinates and the like, such as sodium phosphate, citrate, borate, acetate, bicarbonate and carbonate. These agents may be present in amounts sufficient to maintain a pH of the system of between 2 to 9 and preferably 4 to 8.As such the buffering agent can be as much as 5 on a weight to weight basis of the total composition. Another factor which can affect the gelling temperature of the drug delivery vehicle or pharmaceutical composition is its ionic strength and this can be varied by adding to the drug delivery vehicle a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride or mixtures thereof or even suitable alkali metal salts such as sodium sulfate and the like. The effect of adding sodium chloride is to decrease the gelling temperature by about 30C for a change of 0.2 molar in ionic strength. Fortunately for a typical ophthalmic dosage the pH and ionic strength effects will help maintain the drug delivery system as a gel in the eye. For example, a 27 thermally gelling solution thermogel at pH 4 and low ion ic strength about 0 when in the eye will be bathed with pH 7.4 and isotonic lacrimal fluid which at the surface of the gel will act to lower tae gel sol transition temperature thus helpinq to maintain and insure a qelled formulation in the eye rather than having the drug delivery system liquefy and perhaps be eliminated rapidly from the eye throuqh the lacrimal drainage system Under mome conditions of use when used siibriitanniis 1u or hv intromuscular iniection or when administered to a body cavity the body s pH and ionic strength will help maintain the druq delivery system as a gel. A unique aspect of the gel which is formed in situ in the eye or preferably in the inferior cul de sac of the eye is its prolonqed residence time compared to conventional ophthalmic solutions. The tear turnover usually dilutes and depletes the druq reservoir very rapidly in conventional solutions.The thermogel formulation dissolves more slowly and promotes an enhanced delivery of the dissolved or dispersed agent within it. This prolonged residence time leads to more effective levels of concentration of agent in the tear film. An example of this lonqer residence time of the drug in the tear film is shown in Fiqure 2. The two thermoqel formulations show a higher concentration of timolol for an extended period of time than the conventional marketed product. A dose sparing effect on the total amount of drug or agent applied and greater therapeutic effectiveness can be achieved with the thermoqel formulations due to higher concentration of agent in the tear film when the agent penetrates the eye if this is desired or within the tear film if penetration is not desired. Any pharmaceutically active material diagnostic agent may be delivered in the druq delivery system of this invention. Preferably the drug or pharmaceutical is water soluble althouqh some drugs will show greater solubility in the polymer system than others. Also the drugs or diagnostic agents can be suspended in the polymer vehicle.

The preparation of the drug delivery systems are described below and the appropriate examples which follow were all carried out according to this procedure. Since the polymer systems of this invention dissolve better at reduced temperatures, the preferred methods of solubilization are to add the required amount of polymer to the amount of water to be used. Generally, after wetting the polymer by shaking, the mixture is capped and placed in a cold chamber or in a thermostated container at about OOC to 100C to dissolve the polymer. The mixture can be stirred or shaken to bring about a more rapid solution of the polymer. The drug substance or medicaments and various additives such as buffers, salts and preservatives are then added and dissolved. The final desired pH adjustment can be made by adding the appropriate acids or bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide to the drug delivery system. When used in the eye the pharmaceutical composition will be administered as a fluid by any conventional means of delivering drop formulations to the eye such as by means of an eye dropper or by using an Ocumete . Typically these formulations are intended to be administered into the inferior cul de sac of the eye. This can easily be accomplished by distending the lower lid from the eye and applying the drop within the sac and then releasing the lid. When used to deliver drugs by injection, the pharmaceutical composition will be administered as a liquid by use of an appropriate syringe adapted with the appropriate delivery tube or needle. When used to deliver drugs rectally, urethrally or vaginally, the pharmaceutical composition will be administered as a liquid by use of an appropriate syringe adapted with the appropriate delivery tube or needle. Also when used to treat conditions o the ear or nose the pharmaceutical composition will be administered as a liquid by any conventional means of delivering drop formulations such as by means of an eye dropper or by using a Squeeze bottle such as an Ocumete Any convenient method can be used to apply the pharmaceutical composition to the skin such as a bottle from which the solution is poured from. A ball roller can be used or a dropper type application employing a rubber dropper. EXAMPLES The following examples are illustrations and are not intended to be restrictive of the scope of the invention. All percentages are given in w w and all pH measurements are for 100C. In the animal experiments, 25 mg of each solution was administered to the inferior cul de sac of the eye. OPHTHALMIC EXAMPLE 1 The use of the polymer vehicle to deliver pilocarpine. Solution 1 Solution 2 Solution 3Pilocarpine 0.58 0.18 0.5 Tetronic 1307 27.0 27.0 pH adjusted with HC1 to 4.0 4.0 4.0 sufficient purified water to make 100 100 100 gel sol transi tion temp. 260C 260C Pilocarpine is known to produce a miotic effect constriction of the iris . In an experiment in rabbits the mimic effect of pilocarpine in the thermally gelling solutions 1 and 2 was compared with solution 3, a conventional liquid drop. The pupillary diameter change was measured over 3 hours.The results showed solution 1 had a larger area under the curve than 2 or 3 and that solutions 2 and 3 had about the same AUC. The relative area under the curve measurements Solution Relative AUC 1 1.3 2 0.9 3 1.0 These results indicate about a 5 fold reduction in pilocarpine concentration in the thermally gelling solution solution 2 can produce a similar pharmacological response as a conventional drop solution 3 . EXAMPLE 2 The use of. the polymer vehicle to deliver timolol. Solution 1 Solution 2Timolol maleate 0.68 0.68 Tetronic 1307 22.0 27.0 pH adjusted with HC1 to 4 4 sufficient water to make 100 100 gel sol transition temperature 300 260 The thermally gelling solutions 1 and 2 were compared to the commercially available TimopticX solution Timolol maleate 0.68 . The experiment involved measurement of the lacrimal fluid concentration of the drug with time. Even though a biological response is not measured, the effect of the thermally gelling solutions in maintaining higher drug concentrations for extended periods of time provides an indication of the response the drug should have. The solutions can be compared from the first order decay rates and AUC. Relative Solution Half life AUC Solution 1 3.8 min. 2.7 Solution 2 13 min. 3.3 TimopticzR 1.1 min. 1 The thermally gelling solutions provide much slower elimination rates of the drug from eye.

The elimination rates of norfloxacin were slower for the thermally gelling solutions 1, 2 and 3 and produced larger AUC. Solution Relative AUC 1 2.2 2 1.7 3 1.9 4 1 EXAMPLE 4 Solution I Solution 2Norfloxacin 0.4 . 0.2 Tetronic 1307 27.0 0 0 pH adjusted with HC1 to 4 4 sufficient purified water to make 100 100 The solutions in Example 4 can be used to demonstrate that a larger dose of drug can be administered in the thermally gelling solution without exceeding the saturation level of the drug.Solutions 1 and 2 in the rabbit eye both give initial concentrations of about 2 mg ml even though solution 1 has twice the concentration. The slower release from such a thermally gelling solutions would be of value under such conditions.
