## Description
The present invention is directed generally to photocurable compositions for use as protective surface coatings on various substrates such as metal, wood, plastic and paper. This invention relates to novel 100 percent solids, solvent borne, nitrile resin, photocurable coating compositions. In another aspect, the invention relates to novel coating compositions and the process for curing the coating compositions, which coatings have excellent appearance, adhesion and hardness, good barrier properties and very good corrosion resistance. In another aspect, this invention relates to an improved novel photocurable process employing thermal post cure treatment of coating compositions. Many varieties of coating compositions have been used in the past based on various polymeric materials. These coatings are either solvent borne or water borne. Solvent borne coatings are disadvantageous in that large amounts of volatile organic solvents are present. These solvents may be costly and hazardous. Water borne coatings are also disadvantageous in that they are not continuous and have been found to contain more pinholes and voids than the solvent borne coatings. Furthermore, the cure of these coatings often requires excessive input of thermal energy. Photocured coating compositions are becoming popular because they eliminate the air pollution problems associated with removal of solvents in the thermally cured coating composition. As a consequence, the search for essentially a solvent free, non polluting, low energy utilizing coating process has led to the use of radiation curable coating systems. The advantages of a solventless coating system includes the minimization of surface defects due to the absence of solvents and excellent heat and chemical resistance. A current approach as found in U.S. patent 4,359,370 involves partial vinyl epoxy ester which can be partially cured by UV radiation followed by a post thermal cure. As a result of an increasing need for photocured coating compositions, new processes need to be developed that produce photocurable coating compositions with improved properties. The use of nitrile barrier latex coatings are known in the art. Representative examples of nitrile latex coating compositions and their preparation include those disclosed in U. S. Patent Nos 4,379,875 and 4,374,948. These patents teach that the nitrile latex coatings are thermally cured. Thermally cured nitrile latex coating processes require a high thermal energy input. Further, thermally cured coating compositions generally are 5 15 mils thick for corrosion resistant systems. A general discussion of photoinduced curing is available in Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Volume 19, p. 607, Radiation Curing , John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 1982. It is an object of this invention to provide high nitrile coating compositions which are photocured at ambient temperatures. It is another object of this invention to develop a new photocurable process for producing photocurable coating compositions. It is another object of this invention to develop a process to produce photocurable coating compositions which are corrosion resistant and have good adhesion to various substrates. These and other objects, together with the advantages over known methods shall become apparent from the specification which follows and are accomplished by the invention as hereinafter described and claimed. This invention relates to a coating composition comprising a a high nitrile resin, b a photopolymerizable solvent, and c a photoinitiator. The novel coating compositions of the present invention are hard, resistant to chemical attack, tenaciously adhere to various substrates, are capable of being coated as a thin film and are cured by irradation, avoiding high thermal energy input. The novel coating compositions of the present invention avoids solvent volatility and the need for solvent recovery. The invention further includes a process to produce said coating compositions, comprising The invention further includes an improved process for preparing photocurable coating compositions comprising The high nitrile photocurable coating compositions of this invention can be used for industrial corrosion protection of metals where coating properties such as adhesion, hardness and corrosion resistance are important. The photocurable process of the instant invention produces coatings that can be used for industrial corrosion protection of metal, wood, plastic, paper and the like. Major uses for the coatings would be in the automotive industry as primers, in the oil industry as coating for pipeline and others. Further, the coating compositions may also be used in other fields such as adhesives, sealants, electrical components and the like. The photocurable coating compositions of the instant invention are the reaction products of the high nitrile resins, photopolymerizable solvents and photoinitiators. The coating compositions of the present invention contain high nitrile resins in at least from 10 percent to 60 percent of the total weight. More preferably, the coating compositions contain high nitrile resins in from 20 percent to 55 percent, and most preferably from 30 percent to 50 percent of the total weight. In the practice of this invention any of the high nitrile resins can be employed either alone or in combination. High nitrile resins used in this invention comprise by weight, 40 90 percent nitrile monomer, 5 40 percent monovinyl monomer, and 1 30 percent rubber component. The high nitrile resins useful in the inventive coatings can be prepared by any method known in the art. Preferably, these high nitrile resins are prepared by polymerization in an emulsion of a major portion of an olefinically unsaturated monovinyl nitrile, a second monovinyl monomer component copolymerizable therewith and a preformed rubber component. The preparation of typical high nitrile resins are more fully described in U. S. Patent No 4,379,875 which is herein incorporated. The preferred high nitrile resins comprise a copolymer produced by the polymerization of a major portion of a vinyl mono unsaturated nitrile and a minor portion of a second monovinyl monomer component. The olefinically unsaturated nitriles used in the present invention are the alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated mononitriles having the structure The monovinyl monomer component copolymerizable with the olefinically unsaturated nitrile includes one or more of the esters of olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids, vinyl esters, vinyl ethers, alpha olefins, vinyl aromatic monomers and others.

The second component of the coating compositions of the present invention is a photopolymerizable solvent. These solvents are any which are compatible with the high nitrile resin components and are generally well known in the art. During photocure a radical induced polymerization of the solvent is triggered photochemically by exposure to irradiation. The coating compositions are classified as 100 percent solids because the photopolymerizable solvent crosslinks and is incorporated into the coating. Minor amounts of other solvents may optionally be used which may be volatile, which does not defeat the object of this invention, to provide a substantially 100 percent solid coating composition. These photopolymerizable solvents can be employed either alone or in combination. The coating compositions generally contain, in percent of the total weight, from 30 percent to 99 percent, preferably from 40 percent to 80 percent and most preferably from 50 percent to 75 percent the photopolymerizable solvent. Types of suitable photopolymerizable solvents include acrylates, olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids and their anhydrides, vinyl esters, vinyl halides, vinyl cyanides, vinyl amides, vinyl amines, olefins and others.

The most preferred are N vinyl pyrrolidone, gamma butyrolactone and styrene. The third component of the coating composition of the present invention is the photoinitiator. During cure the photoinitiators absorb actinic radiation, forming reactive free radical intermediates that react further with the photopolymerizable solvent and resin. A general discussion of chemical reaction initiators is available in Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 13, pp. 355 373, Initiators , John Wiley and Sons, 1978. These photoinitiators can be employed either alone or in combination in an amount sufficient to effect the photocure of the coating composition upon irradiation. The coating composition generally contains, in percent of the total weight, from 0.1 percent to 10 percent by weight, preferably from 0.1 percent to 5 percent by weight, and most preferably from 0.5 percent to 2 percent by weight, of the photoinitiator. These photoinitiator additives and the cure thereof are generally well known in the art. Examples of suitable photoinitiators include acetophenone derivatives, azo compounds, benzoin derivatives, amines and their derivatives, anthraquinone derivatives, dibenzyl ketones, benzophenone derivatives, benzoin alkyl ethers and the like. Particular non limiting examples of the photoinitiators include benzophenone, benzyl, benzoin ethyl ether, and azobisisobutyronitrile. Most preferred is benzophenone and ethyl diethanolamine or similar amines. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the coating compositions of the instant invention may be further modified by the addition of plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, dispersants, defoamers, surfactants, extenders, fillers, reinforcing agents and other film formers. The coating compositions of the instant invention may also optionally contain various flattening agents, surface active agents, thixotropic agents, UV light absorbers, flow control agents viscosity agents, antioxidant agents and dyes. All these additives and the use thereof are well known in the art and do not require extensive discussion, it being understood that any compound possessing the ability to function in such a manner, i.e., as a flattening agent, surface active agent, UV light absorber and the like, can be used so long as they do not deleteriously affect the photocuring of the coating composition and do not adversely affect the characteristics of the coating. The process of the instant invention can employ any coating compositions that can be photocured, in particular the novel coating compositions described in this specification. Coating compositions cured by irradiation require a first component coating resin comprising monomers, oligomers or polymers having at least one reactive site, a second component comprising photoinitiators which induce polymerization by free radical formation and optionally a third component comprising photopolymerizable solvents. Typical exemplary first components in the photocurable coating compositions include but are not limited to high nitrile resins, epoxies, acrylics, polyesters, aliphatic polyurethanes, aromatic polyurethanes, nitrile rubber polymers, vinyl chlorides, vinyl acetate containing polymers, amideacrylates, cyclized rubbers, allyic esters, phenolic polymers and acid functional acrylic resins and the like. Typical exemplary photoinitiators and photopolymerizable solvents used in the photocurable coating compositions are any of the aforementioned photoinitiators and photopolymerizable solvents. These compounds of photocured coating compositions are generally well known in the art and can be easily prepared by a skilled artisan. In the practice of this inventive process, the photocurable coating compositions are first compounded by adding together monomeric, oligomeric or polymeric components, preferably a high nitrile resin, and the photopolymerizable solvent, if desired, in any order to form a mixture. To this mixture is then added the photoinitiators, preferably in the dark, with stirring. Optionally, at any step prior to the photocure in the process, any of the aforementioned additives may be stirred into the mixture. The various component of the photocurable coating composition are thoroughly mixed to form a generally homogeneous coating composition. A thin, relatively uniform film of coating resins is applied onto a substrate by any of the known means such as Guardco wet film applicator rods, knife, bar, airless spraying, dipping, roller coating, flowing, brushing, conventional and or electrostatic spray gun, electrodeposition, and the like. The various substrates employed can be wood, paper, metal, pretreated metal, plastic and the like. Generally, the coating composition is applied in an amount sufficient to provide a dry cured coating thickness of from 0.05 mil to 5 mil, preferably from 0.1 mil to 3 mil and most preferably from 0.2 mil to 1.3 mil. Optionally, multiple coats of the composition may be applied to the substrate. The coating composition is then cured by irradiation. The light source preferably emits wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectrum from 2,200 Angstroms to 14,000 Angstroms. Irradiation exposure should be for a strength and time sufficient to cause crosslinking resulting in a tack free cured coating. The systems used to generate ultraviolet radiation for the photopolymerization reaction can be any known in the art such as low pressure, medium pressure, high pressure, or super high pressure, mercury lamps mercury, carbon and plasma arc lamps xenon lamps UV light emitting diodes UV emitting lasers and the like. The photopolymerizable coating compositions can also be cured using an electron beam apparatus. The coating compositions are photocured to a tack free coating at ambient temperature as low as about 10 C with the upper temperature limits at about 100 C. During photocure, as the temperature increases there can be simultaneous UV and thermal cures occurring to the coating compositions. After UV curing, there is present on the surface of the substrate a hard, non tacky, mar, adhesion and chemical resistant coating which tenaciously adheres to the substrate. The photocured coating compositions in another embodiment are then baked after the photocure step at a temperature from 40 C to 240 C preferably from 90 C to 180 C, and most preferably from 100 C to 140 C. The photocured coating compositions are post baked for 30 seconds to 24 hours, preferably for 1 minute to 8 hours, most preferably for 2 minutes to 2 hours. After photocuring and post baking there is present on the surface a hard, non tacky, mar, adhesion and chemical resistant coating. The coating compositions are comprised of the photoreaction products of the high nitrile resins, the photopolymerizable solvents and the photoinitiators. It is theorized that the photocured coatings of the instant invention most likely form additional crosslinks by grafting a solvent onto resin. Upon absorption of radiation the photoinitiator forms a radical species which initiates polymerization. Upon initiation of polymerization grafting may occur. Grafting may occur between resin and resin resin and solvent and solvent and solvent with the photoinitiators incorporated therein. That is, it is believed that the coating is comprised of several polymerizable monomers grafted onto the high nitrile resin. 100 percent solids coating compositions occur because the photopolymerizable solvent upon curing, crosslinks in the coating compositions thus the photopolymerizable solvent is polymerized and is not volatile. It is further believed that by employing a thermal post treatment to the compositions, further crosslinking and grafting occurs. The thermal post treatment results in an enhanced corrosion resistant photocured coating compositions because the additional crosslinks and grafts causes the composition to have improved barrier properties and improved corrosion resistance. The coatings superior properties are derived not only from the ability of the polymer matrix to crosslink and graft but also from the ability of the nitrogen containing monomers to act as corrosion inhibitors. A general discussion as to how coatings function is available in, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Volume 7, p. 113, Corrosion and Corrosion Inhibitors , John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1979. and L. Blecher, D.H. Lorenz, H.L. Lowd, A.S. Wood and D.P. Wyman, Handbook of Water Soluble Gums and Resins , R.L. Davidson, ed., McGraw Hill, N.Y. 1980. The high nitrile resin photocurable coating compositions of the present invention exhibit excellent photocurability to irradiation, long term storage stability and give a rigid film having good bonding properties and workability after the photocuring step. By selection of components and additives the compositions may be applied both as transparent coatings and opaque coatings. The thermal post treatment employed in the photocurable coatings process of the instant invention enhances the corrosion resistance of the coating compositions. The following examples demonstrate the process and advantages of the present invention. The following photocurable coating compositions 1 14, A, B and C were prepared by dissolving a high nitrile resin in a photopolymerizable solvent by stirring. To this solution, in the dark, was added the photoinitiator system. The resulting mixture was stirred to form generally a homogeneous mixture of the composition. The coating composition of 1 14, A, B and C were applied by Guardco available from Paul N. Gardener, Lauderdale By The Sea, Florida wet film application rods to the surface of two phosphate cold rolled steel approximately 10 cm x 15 cm test panels. Coated panels 1 14, B and C were then exposed to ultraviolet light until a tack free coating composition resulted. Photocured coated panels 13 and 14 were then heat treated at the temperature and for the time indicated in Table III. Comparative photocured panels B and C were not post heat treated. Comparative Example A which has the same coating composition as Example 2 was cured by employing a thermal process. The coated panel was placed in an oven at 100 C for 30 minutes. In each case, ASTM standard adhesion tape test and hardness pencil tests were carried out in the coated metal substrate. Identical duplicate coated metal substrates were subjected to salt fog exposure. The adhesion tape test ASTM D3359 78 was carried out by applying a strip of Scotch Brand No. 670 tape 3M to a cross cut section previously made by a sharp tool in the coated substrate. The tape was then removed. The percent adhesion, of coating remaining on the substrate, was assessed on a 0 100 scale with no adhesion being 0 and 100 percent adhesion being no loss of coating. The hardness test measures the rigidity of the organic coating applied to rigid substrates such as metal panels. The hardness test, ASTM D 3363 74 was carried out by forcing pencil leads of increasing hardness values against the coated surface in a precisely defined manner, until one lead mars the surface. Surface hardness is defined by the hardest pencil lead which just fails to mar the coated surface. Test ranges are 6B to 8H with 8H being excellent, that is, the hardest lead failed to mar the coating. The Impact ASTM D 2794 82 test measure the tendency for a coating to crack after being deformed by an impacting force. A falling stainless steel ball weight hits a panel with the coated side down for the reverse impact test and the coated side up for the direct impact test. The height of the fall in inches multiplied by the dropping weight in pounds is the impact energy. Test ranges are 0 160 inch pounds in lb . To pass the test, a tape of standard scotch brand is applied to the impacted area and snapped off and the coating must remain intact. A 160 means there is no loss of coating after the tape is snapped off and 0 is a failure. The results are shown in Table I for each of the compositions 1 12. The salt fog ASTM B 117 test measures the corrosion resistance of the coating composition. Salt fog testing was carried out by masking with black tape uncoated portions of the panel. Then the rest of the panel is coated with the coating composition and a large X is scribed in the dried coated panel. The panel is placed in a salt fog cabinet for a given period of time. The cabinet induced accelerated corrosion testing through exposure of the specimens to a salt fog atmosphere. A rating is given based on the degree of rusting and length of time the sample have been exposed to the salt fog atmosphere. Test ranges are 0 to 10, with a 0 rating for all rust and a 10 rating for no appreciable rust, furthermore, the scale is logarithmic between the two extreme endpoints. The results of the salt fog testing are shown in Table II. The results of the coating compositions 1 12 with varying thickness demonstrates 60 percent to 100 percent adhesion, 2H to 8H hardness with most of the test points showing excellent hardness, a 5 in lb to 160 in lb direct impact, and 0 in lb to 100 in lb reverse impact. These results demonstrate that the coating compositions of the instant invention show excellent adhesion, hardness and good barrier properties. The results for Examples 13 and 14 and comparative examples B and C showed 100 percent adhesion and 8H hardness for all test specimens. The ASTM standard adhesion, hardness, impact and salt fog measurements could not be carried out because the coating compositions did not form, it was only tacky film on metal substrate. The results from the hardness and adhesion tests demonstrate that the excellent hardness and adhesive properties of the photocured coating compositions are not changed by the post thermal treatment in the process of the instant invention. The results of the salt fog testing demonstrate that photocurable coating compositions 1 12 provided in accordance with this invention renders protection from corrosion such that there is no appreciable rust from 24 to 1050 hours. These results exemplify the very good corrosion resistance of the coating composition of the instant invention. The results from the salt fog tests 13, 14, B and C demonstrates that the corrosion resistance is significantly enhanced by the process of the instant invention employing a thermal post treatment of photocured coating compositions. The coating compositions of the instant invention can be employed for various uses where all the properties are not required for good coating compositions, for example a good corrosion resistent coating may not be employed in an environment requiring high impact strength. Although the invention has been described in detail through the preceeding examples, these examples are for the purpose of illustration only, and it is understood that variations and modifications can be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.
