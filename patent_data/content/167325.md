# METHOD OF ADDING ZSM 5 CONTAINING CATALYST TO MOVING BED CATALYTIC CRACKING UNITS

## Abstract
A process for changeover of a moving bed catalytic cracking unit s catalyst inventory from conventional catalyst to ZSM 5 containing catalyst is disclosed. Moderate amounts of catalyst rich in ZSM 5 are added to the circulating catalyst inventory over an extended period of time to avoid a sudden change in catalyst characteristics. After 20 80 percent of the catalyst inventory has been replaced with ZSM 5 rich catalyst, future catalyst additions are made with catalysts containing a reduced ZSM 5 content, or only intermittant ZSM 5 rich catalyst addition is practiced.
