# Slide fastener stringer having continuous thermoplastic molded coupling element strip.

## Abstract
A slide fastener stringer 1 having a continuous zigzag shaped thermoplastic molded coupling element strip 3 . The strip 3 includes a succession of spaced coupling ele ments 5 , each having a pair of first and second legs 9, 10 extending from a head 8 in a common direction, and a plurality of first and second solid connecting portions 6, 7 alternately disposed at opposite sides of the strip 3 and extending one between each adjacent pair of the coupling elements 5 . Each first connecting portion 6 and each second connecting portion 7 extend between an adjacent pair of the first legs 9 and between an adjacent pair of the second legs 10 , respectively. The connecting portions 6, 7 are thin or slenderer than the legs 9, 10 . A pair of connector threads 11, 12 transversely of the coupling ele ments 5 through the full length of the strip 3 and em bedded in the first and second legs 9, 10 , respectively, of each coupling element 5 , each connector thread 11, 12 eing disposed close to and extending along a respective one of such two series of the first and second connecting portions 6, 7 .
