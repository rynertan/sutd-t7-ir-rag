# A combination car system.

## Abstract
A combination car system made up from a first car 1 and a second car 100 , both of which are capable of tur ning independently. The first car includes a pair of front wheels 3 by which it is driven, a pair of rear wheels 4 , an engine, a braking system, and a transmission and the engine, the braking system, and the transmission, when the first car is running independently, are controlled from the first car 1 . The second car 100 includes a pair of front wheels 103 , a pair of rear wheels 104 by which it is driven, an engine, a braking system, and a transmission. The engine, the braking system, and the transmission, when the second car is running independently, are control led from the second car. The first car 1 and the second car 101 are couplable together into a coupled car which runs on the pair of front wheels of the first car 101 and the pair of rear wheels of the second car, with the pair of rear wheels 4 of the first car and the pair of front wheels 103 of the second car being removed from road contact. The operation of the engine of the first car is at this time coupled to the operation of the engine of the second car, so that the combined operation of both these engines is controlled from the first car 1 and the operation of the braking system of the first car is coupled to the operation of the braking system of the second car, so that the com bined operation of both these braking systems is controlled from the first car. Further, at this time the transmission of the second car is controlled from the first car.
