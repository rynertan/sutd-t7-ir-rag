# ELECTRIC HEATER FOR INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING MACHINERY IN GENERAL

## Abstract
This invention relates to an electric heater for industrial processing machinery in general. A currently much felt problem in the manufacture of electric heaters for industrial processing machines is that it is not always possible to achieve a uniform and accurate distribution of temperature at the region to be heated. The above technical problem is solved hereby with an electric heater 1 for industrial processing machinery in general, which comprises a supporting housing 2,3 adapted for association with a region of an industrial processing machine to be heated. The housing carries, on its side facing the region to be heated, a plurality of electric resistors, preferably in the form of electric wire coils inserted in quartz tubes 20 , adapted to deliver heat mainly by radiation to said region to be heated.
