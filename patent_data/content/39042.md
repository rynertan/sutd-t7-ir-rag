# Deflection control in a roll.

## Abstract
A roll comprises a supporting, non rotating shaft 1 and a rotatable mantle portion 2 supported thereon by means of a plurality of bearing units 3a,3b . The bearing units 3a at the end portions of the shaft 1 are provided with a flexible mounting 6,8,9 with respect to the shaft 1 and or the man tle portion 2 . The flexible mounting 6,8,9 is connected to flexible elements 4 influencing the support of the mantle portion 2 . The spring modulus of the flexible elements 4 is adapted to the stiffness of the shaft 1 , so that, under external loading of the roll, the flexible elements 4 allow the ends of said shaft 1 to move radially relative to said mantle portion 2 , but resist this movement with an elastic force being dependent on the angle of deflection of said shaft 1 , thereby keeping the deflection of said mantle portion 2 within pre determined limits.
