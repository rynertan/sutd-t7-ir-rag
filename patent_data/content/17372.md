# Method of and apparatus for non destructive testing.

## Abstract
A method of non destructive testing wherein ultrasonic signals from a transducer are converted into television wave form and stored on video recording magnetic tape for reproduction as required. Because the signals are recorded live rather than in the form of a cathode ray oscilloscope display they can be rectified as necessary. Positional co ordinates of the transducer may be stored so that B scans at varying thresholds can be reproduced. Position and ultraso nic signals are interleaved on the video recording magnetic tape. Apparatus for performing the method includes a video recording device having a rotatable head and interface units for converting the radio frequency signals into television wave form and for decoding the signals for reproduction.
