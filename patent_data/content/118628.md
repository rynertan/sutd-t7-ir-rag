## Description
REINFORCED FILM AND LAMINATING METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURE THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method and apparatus for forming a flexible, reinforced plastic sheet material of indeterminate length and more particularly relates to forming a laminated plastic sheet material made from two films of a multi layer thermoplastic material and a rectilinear web of machine direction MD and transverse direction TD strands or films which are simultaneously laid down between the films. Shipping sacks are used to store and ship 25 100 pound commodity lots of many diverse materials for example, grain, cement, fertilizer, peat moss, minerals, chemicals, plastic resins, etc. Bulk sacks are used for shipping and storing much larger quantities of many of these same materials. Among the numerous component materials which are used for such sacks are single ply 4 10 mil LDPE or ItDPE HDPE co extruded film and cross laminatedMD oriented HDPE film. Reinforced composite sheets are also available for such sacks, as described, for example, in U.S. 4,161,559. Other uses for reinforced composite sheets are coverings for greenhouses, barns, buildings under construction, and commodities which must be stored in the open. The reinforcing material may be in the form of a non woven or pre woven scrim or woven mesh material having openings between the strands that are wider in inverse proportion to the severity of the loads to be met. Such a reinforced composite sheet is described in U.S. 3,616,130. Methods for producing reinforced composite sheets include the layering of a scrim between a pair of flexible films U.S. 3,186,893 4,088,805 and 4,106,261 and the formation of a woven or non woven pattern of MD and TD fibers simultaneously with or immediately prior to the layering operation U.S. 1,914,801 3,169,087 3,272,679 3,414,453 3,496,053 3,511,739 3,686,062 and 3,950,583 . Non woven patterns may be sinusoidal U.S.1,914,801 , MD TD grid U.S. 2,851,389 , or helical U.S.3,169,087 3,272,679 3,332,823 and 3,332,824 . Apparatuses for forming such non woven patterns include the following diverse arranments a an endless reciprocating tape and guide bar arrangement for forming a cyclically deposited web U.S. 3,272,679 b a rotary apparatus for winding a helix of strands around a pair of endless carriers having opposed and substantially parallel reaches U.S. 3,332,823 and 3,332,824 c a horizontal rotary drum mounted above a rotating table at the top end of a post carrying plastic strands for making laminated webs of filamentary reinforcing material U.S. 3,414,453 d a positioning plate for moving warp strands under tension imparted by creel andtension carts about the surface of a cylindrical support while adhesively coated fill strands are wound about the warp strands to form a tubular web of fabric U.S.3,496,053 e a plurality of strand guide bars carried by a reciprocating tape and operated simultaneously in reciprocating movements, with a phase shift of 1800 between the guide bars, to produce an array of reinforcing strands having sinusoidal configurations with multiple overlap patterns U.S. 3,511,739 and f a fixed creel containing reels in two parallel rows making a first lap of warp threads, a rotary creel containing a series of reels spaced apart about the circumference of a coaxial circle, an elongated comb for distributing the warp threads into a plane, a circular plate for winding the weft threads into an annular lap in flattened spirals about the lap of warp threads, and cutters for opening up the annular lap U.S. 3,950,583 . Co axially extruding two different thermoplastic materials from a single annular extruder die to form a duplex film by the blown tube method is described in U.S. 3,223,761 and 3,467,565. Various combinations of polymers and co polymers in multi layered duplex plastic sheets, having differing melting points in the inner and outer layers for bonding by heat and pressure to a web of reinforcing material therebetween, are described in U.S. 3,616,130. Many of these processes produce composite sheet materials having excellent strength properties, but the materials have such excessive thicknesses or the processes operate at such slow speeds or are afflicted with so many maintenance or adjustment problems that costs are excessive.In consequence, shipping sacks made from plastic film have thus far been utilized in a small fraction of the shipping sack packaging business. Accordingly, a thinner composite sheet having adequate strength and other physical properties at a basis weight that is at least 30 less than the weight of presently available composite sheets is needed. A simpler on machine method and an apparatus for forming a reinforcing grid and for bonding the grid to the film on either side thereof to form the thinner composite sheet at lower cost are equally needed. Additionally, a method of bonding this novel sheet along the edges thereof to form a tubular article, in order to retain the desirable properties of central portions of the sheet, is also desirable in order to obtain shipping sacks with uniformly suitable properties. It is therefore an object to provide a composite film sheet of indeterminate length, having a selectively high strength at a basis weight which is approximately 30 less than that used in shipping sacks at the present time. It is also an object to provide a composite film sheet comprising two films and a reinforcing grid in which the transverse direction film is continuous, is in parallel reaches at a selected spacing between the reaches, and has 1800 loops connecting the ends of the reaches and disposed entirely within and between the films. It is additionally an object to provide a grid of machine direction fibers, having a selected first strength weight ratio and a selected first spacing between the filaments, and a single transverse direction fiber which has a selected second strength weight ratio and is disposed transversely and adjacent to the machine direction fibers as parallel reaches which 1 are connected sequentially by loops, 2 have a selected second spacing between the reaches, and 3 are bonded to the MD fibers. It is further an object to provide a fiberreinforced composite film sheet of indeterminate length, comprising a pair of co extruded film sheets which are disposed in straddling relationship to the MD fibers and TD fibers so that each film sheet comprises an outer layer having a low softening temperature, whereby the pairs of film sheets, the MD fibers, and the TD fiber are bonded together under heat and pressure. It is still further an object to provide a fiberorienting apparatus for continuously forming a single fiber into a plurality of transverse direction reaches which are connected at the ends thereof by 1800 loops. It is also an object to provide an apparatus for continuously juxtaposing a pair of films, the machinedirection fibers, and the looped transverse direction fiber into a sandwich. It is another object to provide a means for removing the loops from the film orienting apparatus without displacement of the loops and transverse direction reaches within the film sheets. In accordance with these objectives and the principles of this invention, a composite film sheet of indeterminate length, having a selectively high strength at a basis weight which is approximately 50 less than that used in shipping sacks at the present time, is prior vided.This composite film sheet comprises A. X MD fibers having a selected first strength weight ratio and a selected first spacing between the fibers B. a single TD fiber which has a selected second strength weight ratio and is disposed within the composite film as parallel reaches which 1 are connected sequentially by loops, 2 have a selected second spacing therebetween, and 3 are disposed transversely to the MD filaments and C. a pair of co extruded film sheets which are disposed in straddling relationship to the MD fibers and the TD fiber so that the loops are enclosed between the film sheets, each film sheet comprising an outer layer having a high softening temperature, and an inner layer having a low softening temperature, whereby the pairs of film sheets, the MD fibers, and the TD fiber are bonded together under heat and pressure. Preferably, the film sheets are co extruded, and the inner layers are bonded to both the MD fibers and the TD fiber. If necessary in a particular combinati9n of fiber and film compositions, an adhesive is added to the fibers. It is particularly suitable that such an adhesive be deposited on the MD fibers, such as by coating the fibers before usage thereof. However, it is further within the scope of the invention to coat the film sheets and the TD fiber, alternatively or additionally. It is also a part of this invention to utilize fibers in the form of co extruded tape, having external layers of low density polyethylene, whereby no adhesive is needed. The continuous method of this invention for manufacturing a composite sheet material, having a combination of high strength properties and light weight, comprises the following steps A. continuously drawing a plurality of machine direction MD fibers from bobbins within a creel B. passing these MD fibers in longi tudinally forward movement through a comb and forming a first planar lap of parallel, longitudinally aligned fibers, C. drawing a single transverse direction end fiber from a bobbin at a high linear velocity D. passing this single TD fiber between spindles within an interweaving section of a pair of endless, spindle equipped chains which coopera tively comprise the interweaving section, a diverging section, and a parallel section while revolving in opposite directions as a pair of planar patterns which are parallel to the first planar lap E. engaging the single TD fiber around the successively interweaving spindles of the spindle equipped chains to form a successive plurality of closely spaced loops when each spindle of one chain pulls the TD fiber toward and beyond the previously passing spindle of the other chain F. laterally extending the single fiber, by longitudinal movement of the inward sides through the diverging section, to separate transversely alternate loops in the plurality of loops and form two rows of loops and a plurality of closed spacedTD fiber reaches which are transversely disposed to the longtudinally aligned MD fibers and connected at ends thereof by the plurality of loops G. continuing to move the transversely disposed TD reaches and loops through the parallel section of the pair of chains H. drawing a pair of films from a supply thereof I. forwardly passing the pair of films in straddling and parallel relationship to the plurality of longitudinally extending fibers and the plurality of transversely disposed fibers J. converging the films, the TD reaches, and the MD fibers to form a fiber film sandwich K. edge sealing the sandwich along each edge but inwardly of the adjacent row of loops L. withdrawing the loops from the spindles M. transversely stretching the withdrawn sandwich N. laminating the longitudinally extending films, the transversely disposed reaches and loops, and the pair of films to form the composite sheet and 0. winding the laminated sheet. The pair of films are suitably formed by slitting a flattened tube of extruded film, drawn from a roll thereof as the supply of step E, at the sides thereof.If the roll of extruded film is on approximately the same level as the laminating apparatus, each of the films is passed over a turning bar, whereby the drawing of stepH and the forwardly passing of step I are perpendicularly related. The films are transversely stretched by passage through a lateral expansion means, after the turning operation. Laminating the fiber film sandwich inwardly of the loops, for holding the transversely disposed TD reaches and the MD fibers in place within the sandwich, forms a laminated strip on each side of the sandwich.Such strip laminating is done by two pairs of opposed heated rolls. The withdrawing of step L is performed by a pair of cams which lift the loops from the spindles. The transverse stretching of step M is performed by transversely disposed rolls having frictional surfaces with respect to the films. The laminating of step N is performed by a pair of heated rolls. The extruded film is suitably a co extrusion of high density and low density polyethylene. Preferably, the high density polyethylene is 25 of the film by weight, and the low density polyethylene is adjacent to the fibers.The fibers are suitably coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive. The MD and TD fibers may be in the form of monofilaments or may be MD oriented polypropylene tape.Alternatively, polypropylene tape is extruded with lowdensity polyethylene, whereby lamination between MD andTD fibers and between the fibers and the film requires no adhesive. The fiber reinforced film sheet of this invention generally comprises a non woven fiber network which is laminated between two layers of co extruded plastic film.The machine direction fibers suitably consist of five hundred denier 0.050 inch wide by 0.002 inch thick oriented polypropylene tape. The fibers are disposed a suitable distance apart within the first planar lap. This distance apart is in accordance with the strength required for end use of the film sheet. For example, they may be 0.375 inch apart, on centers. The transverse direction fiber is disposed in a serpentine form, with adjacent reaches of the fiber disposed 0.375 inch apart, also measured on centers, as an exemplary distance apart. The three eighths inch spacing between MD and TD fibers is one specific example which is widely useful, but many other spacings are feasible and highly suitable for particular applications The MD fibers and. the TD fiber are generally both polypropylene.Polypropylene tape is one highly satisfactory embodiment, but monofilaments and multi filaments of polypropylene and other high strength polymers can be used to form specific products having certain desired properties. Polypropylene in the form of tapes, fibers, and filaments which are oriented in the machine direction for optimum strength properties are well known. When in the form of a single homogeneous product that is extruded and drawn from a round die orifice, a monofilament is produced which has high strength 75,000 psi and medium cost. When extruded from a flat die and slit into narrow widths in the machine direction and MD oriented, polypropylene tape is produced, having medium strength 50,000 psi and low cost. This type of polypropylene fiber is the most widely used in the textile industry at the present time.When extruded from a multitude of fine holes spinerette and spun into the finished yarn, a multifilament strand is produced which has a number of fibers in the strand e.g., 50 , producing a yarn of conventional appearance, much greater flexibility than the monofilament, and wider usefulness in regular textile applications.This product has medium strength 45,000 psi and a higher price than either the monofilament or the polypropylene tape. The tubular co extruded film is 1.5 mil thick and comprises 258 high density polyethylene EDPE and 75 low density polyethylene LDPE . The collapsed tube is slit at the sides or edges to form the pair of single layer films. In addition to polyethylene as the raw material for the co extruded film, liquid or gas barrier materials, such as nylon and films of heavier gauges or lighter gauges, are useful. A suitable apparatus for manufacturing the fiber reinforced or composite film sheet of the invention comprises A. a machine direction multi fiber feed ing assembly B. a transverse direction single fiber feeding assembly C. a fiber orienting means for forming the single fiber into a plurality of transverse direction reaches which are connected by loops at the ends thereof and move in the machine direction at the same speed as do the machine direction fibers D. a film feeding assembly for a pair of co extruded films of indeterminate length which are arranged in straddling relationship to the MD and TD fibers E. a converging assembly for the machine direction and transverse direction fibers and the pair of films to form a fiber film sandwich F. a high temperature nip roll system for laminating the fiber film sandwich together to form the fiber reinforced film sheet and G. a winder for winding the laminated fiber reinforced film sheet into a roll. The apparatus further comprises A. a pair of expander rolls for smoothing and widening the pair of films in the transverse direction, prior to reaching the converging assembly and B. an edge sealing assembly for heat seal ing the pair of co extruded films of the sandwich to the transverse direction reaches within a pair of strips which are disposed close to the loops at each edge but inwardly of the loops, whereby the fiber film sandwich is conjoined within the two strips. This fiber orienting means is an apparatus comprising a pair of endless roller chains which are disposed to revolve in a pair of elongated patterns within a common plane. The opposed portions of the patterns move forwardly and comprise an interweaving section, a diverging section, and a parallel section. Each roller chain comprises a triple strand of linked rollers and a row of spindles which are attached to but are laterally offset from the rollers to project outwardly from the pattern. Each triple strand roller chain comprises pin link plates, roller pins, straight lug link plates, spindle arms attached to the straight lug link plates, and spindles which are rotatably attached to each arm. Each spindle comprises a spindle body having a convex groove for tracking the TD filament. The groove has a crown angle at its center of about SO. The spindle body further comprises a tapered fiber lift off surface having an angle of about 450 to the axis of the spindle. The fiber orienting apparatus, for producing the TD fiber reaches and loops, more specifically comprises a pair of endless roller chain assemblies which each comprise 1 a triple strand roller chain, 2 a row of chain attachment plates, 3 a row of spindle arms, each arm being riveted at one end to one of the attachment plates and extending transversely to the roller chain, 4 a row of spindles, each spindle being attached to the other end of a spindle arm, and each spindle comprising a a central screw and nut which are attached to the arm, b a spindle shaft which coax ially surrounds the screw, c a pair of spindle bearings surrounding the shaft, and d a spindle body having a fiber supporting portion and a tapered lift off portion. The chain system comprises a plurality of spindles lying within a common plane on which the loops are held.For lifting each row of loops from the spindles after passing the edge sealing assembly, a cam means is provided in cooperation with an overlying idler roll which enables the nip rolls to function as an elevating means for directing the fiber film sandwich obliquely to the common plane in which the spindles revolve. Two pairs of edge pulling brushes and two pairs of short Mt. Hope rolls are also incorporated into the apparatus in order to stretch the fiber film sandwich in the transverse direction before reaching the high temperature nip roll system. The method for making this fiber reinforced composite film sheet and the apparatus for carrying out this method are both inherently flexible. The method has flexibility as to adjustable width of the composite film sheet, for example, because the apparatus includes means for selectively moving the pairs of bushing chain assemblies, nip roll systems, loop disengagement devices, and edge pulling devices toward or away from each other.To achieve this flexibility, the idler sprockets on the inner side of the chain loops, the converging assembly, the edge sealing rolls, the loop release cams, the edge pulling brushes, and the tautening rolls 1are all mounted on a pair of frame plates which are transversely movable relative to the frame of the laminator for changing the width of the composite film sheet without changing the overall pitch length of the chain assemblies. The method is also flexible as to construction features of the composite film sheet in order to achieve acceptable performance of a film laminant bag in any specific application by tailoring the strength properties of the composite film sheet so that the bag can pass the requisite performance tests for its type, such as progressive drop, 6 sides drop, and creep. Such construction flexibility can be obtained by using fibers containing various desired proportions of high and low density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamides, polyesters, polystyrene, polyacrylonitriles, polyvinyl chloride, rayon, cotton, wool, and other synthetic and natural fibers, including copolymers, and the like. The denier of the fibers, the center to center spacing therebetween, and the adhesive for bonding MD fibers toTD fibers and for bonding both fibers to the films can also be varied.In addition, low density polyethylene can function as a heat activated adhesive if co extruded as the outer layer for a polypropylene fiber core. Further flexibility of construction can be obtained by varying the type of polymer, its crystallinity, the thickness of the films, and the proportions of polymer types if a layered film construction is selected, such as 25 high density polyethylene and 75 low density polyethylene. The film sheet of the invention may be converted into a tube either by sewing or by hot melt gluing along the edges, provided that there is sufficient overlapping that the rows of filament loops are in overlying relationship to provide a seam having the equivalent strength of the body of the laminate. This tube may then be fed to a bag making operation which can produce bags of desired sizes and strength properties by sewing or gluing along the bottom and top edges of the bags.

The transverse direction fiber storage and feeding assembly 50 comprises a pair of TD fiber bobbins 51, which are supported on a support frame 53, and a TD fiber first feed guide 55 which is also supported on frame 53. Associated. with TD fiber storage and feeding assembly 50 is a TD engagement support stand 64, shown in perspective in Fig. 13, comprising a base 65 which is attached to such components of the apparatus frame as vertical members 48 and horizontal members 49, as seen in Fig. 2. S ipport stand 64 also comprises an upright support 66 which is attached to base 65, a laterally adjustable member 67 and a longitudinal member 68 which are attached to the top end of upright support 66, and a vertically adjustable member 69 at the forward end of member 68. Member 69 has jaw supports at its lower end for clamping a TD fiber eyelet 63 which is made of ceramic and is at the same level as. spindles 90.Eyelet 63 is so positioned, as seen in Figs. 6 and 7, that it is disposed between each spindle 90,90 and the roller chain assemblies 80,8O to which the spindle is attached and is also exactly between the shafts of idler sprocket 79 and drive sprocket 79 , whereby it is at the point where maximum intermeshing of spindles 90,90 occurs in. order to introduce TD fiber reach 57 between spindles 90,90 and above their respective arms 85,85 . The apparatus further comprises a pair of chain drive and support mecsa sms 70,70 and a pair of roller chain assemblies 80,80 for pulling the TD fiber into transverse direction reaches connected by 1800 loops. The drive and support mechanism 70,70 for chains 80,80 comprises a drive sprocket 71 which is visible in Fig. 6, a plurality of bearings 73,73 , shafts 75,75 , gears 77,77 , two pairs of loop fiber relaxation sprockets 78,78 , three pairs of idler sprockets 76, and idler sprocket 79 and drive sprockets 79 at the point of intermeshing, as seen in Fig. 4.

No. 35 3 of the Browning ManufacturingDivision of Emerson Electric Co., pin link plates 81,81 , roller pins 84,84 , straight lug link plates 83,83 such asBrowning A.S.A. No. 3 2 spindle arms 85 which are each attached with a rivet to a link plate 83,83 and extend transversely to z to the vertical row of rollers 82,82 , wear strips 86 which are each attached to and underlie a spindle arm 85, and spindles 90,90 , each spindle being attached to the outer end of an arm 85, as best seen in Figs. 6,7 and 8.Each roller chain assembly 80,80 is arranged to revolve endlessly in a planar pattern that is slightly T shaped so that the two chains in combination form a U, in plan view, which is open toward the discharge end of the apparatus, as shown in Fig. 4.

Spindle shaft 91 and spindle bearings 93 coaxially surround bolt 92. Viewing Fig. 7 as spindles 90,90 revolve in clockwise and counter clockwise directions, respectively, it is readily apparent that they move inwardly past one another and leave a space therebetween which permits eyelet 63 to remain in place without contact with spindles 90,90 . As spindles 90,90 continue to revolve, they move outwardly past one another and leave interweaving section 87 just as they begin to engage the TD fiber which is leaving eyelet 63 to form initial TD reaches 58. Spindles 90,90 then move further apart in diverging section 88 and finally move parallel to one another in parallel section 89 of chains 80,80 , with facing spindles 90,90 moving in the machine direction, while forming TD reaches 59 which are connected by 1800 loops 141 over grooves 98. An auxiliary spindle drive 230 is shown in Figs.21 and 22. An air motor 231 is attached by a shaft to a drive rotor 233 which turns a drive roll 235 having an elastomeric drive surface 237 which contacts the inner sides of spindles 90. Air motor 231 is supported by a base 239 which is attached to an arm 238 and a bar mount 224 which is in turn supported by a clamp and bar support 236 At least one auxiliary spindle 230 is ounted alongside each diverging section 88, close to drive and support mechanisms 70,70 . Preferably, spindle 230 is disposed at spindle No. 5 designating spindle No. I as being on the imaginary line connecting shafts 75,75 A second spindle 230, shown in phantom in Fig. 21, is sutiably disposed at spindle No. 25.The spindles are driven by drive surface 237 at a somewhat higher speed than the speeds imparted by the moving E9 fiber. With such a pair of ansiliary spindle drives 230 as helper drives for chains 80,80 , a maximum speed of 10 12 feet per minut that was obtained on the laminator at the maximum laminator width setting, as compared to about 4 5 feet per minute with no helper drive. With two auxiliary drives 230 along each diverging section, as shown in Fig.21, a speed of 35 feet per minute has been achieved at the maximum width setting. It has been found that using a higher speed than these mtsmum speeds breaks the fiber at its point of maximum tension which is at the maximum divergence point. Additional auxiliary drives 230 may be installed, or a plurality of elastomeric belt drives may be disposed along the entire inner lengths of diverging reaches 88 to impart sequentially greater rotational speeds to spindles 90,90 . Film storage and feeding assembly 100 comprises a roll support stand 101, a dancer and slitter stand 102, three idler rolls 103 which are supported on stand 102, a dancer idler roll 104 which is supported by a counterweighted arm 105 which is pivotally attached to stand 102, four idler rolls 106,107, a pair of edge slitters 108, and an electromagnetic unwinding brake 109, as may be seen inFigs. 1 and 3. Film turning assemblies 120 comprise a support member 121 and two turning bars which are visible inFigs. 1,2,3,4, and 5 and are disposed horizontally and at 450 to the machine direction. They are upper turning bar 123 and lower turning bar 125 which are attached to support 121. Associated with turning bars 123,125 are a pair of idler rolls and a pair of expander rolls for sidewise stretching of the upper and lower films 114,115. These are an upper idler roll 126, an upper Mt. Hope expander roll 127, a lower idler roll 128 and a lower Mt. Hope expander roll 129 which may be seen in Figs. 4,5,9, and 10. Convergence assembly 130 is attached, at each end thereof, to a width adjustment plate 46 of the apparatus and comprises an upper edge plate 131, a lower edge plate 132, side supports 133, and support members 139 to which side supports 733 are attached. Plates 131,132 each comprise a pair of sliding members 134, having adjusting slots 135 and bolts 136, as shown in detail in Fig. 11. The lower edge 137 of plate 131 and the upper edge 138 of plate 132 are the functioning members of convergence assembly 130 then upper and lower edge plates 131 2 have been properly adjusted so that there is virtually no horizontal clearance between them, as indicated in Fig. 10. Edge sealing assembly 150 comprises, as may be clearly seen in Fig. IS, an upper sealing roll 151, a lower sealing roll 152, a pair of gears 153, a sprocket drive 154, a pair of siphon pipes 155, a pair of rotary couplings 156 which are attached to siphon pipes 155 for circulating hot oil through the unit, and an air cylinder 157 for selectively pressurizing rolls 151 and 152 and for vertically retracting roll 151 from roll 152. The assembly is attached to and supported by a frame member 158 through width adjustment plate 46. Rolls 151,152 contain channels 159 through which the hot oil is circulated from pipes 155. Film pickup assembly 160 comprises a cam 161 which is visible in perspective in Fig. 14. Cam 161 comprises a ramp 162, a triangular ledge 163, a top surface 166, and a rigidly attached clamp 165 for attaching cam 161 to a cylindrical support member. Film pickup assembly 160 further comprises a pickup roll 164 which is disposed directly above cam 161 so that there is barely sufficient clearance for sliding passage of the edge laminated sandwich 140 between surface 166 and roll 164, as seen in Figs. 15 17. Edge puller assembly 170, as seen in Fig. 5, comprises two pairs of counter rotating brushes 171,173, two pairs of short Mt. Hope rolls 176, and support stands which are attached to width adjustment plates 46 but are not visible in the drawings. Brushes liy,173 have frictional surfaces which enable them, when counter rotating, to engage the upper and lower surfaces of the film sandwich and pull the outer edges 148 away from each other, thereby smoothing strips 145,147. Rolls 176 keep the entire sheet in taut condition across its surface before it enters the laminator. Laminating assembly 180 comprises an upper heater roll 181, a lower heater roll 183, a frame 185 by which rolls 181,183 are rotatively supported, a pair of air cylinders 187 which control the nip pressure between rolls 181,183 and separate rolls 181,183 for thread up of incoming sandwich 140, and an idler roll 189 which is adjustably positioned on a support member 186. Winder assembly 190 comprises a frame 191, an axle 195, and a drive 193, as seen in Figs. 1 and 2. A toll 197 of the fiber reinforced composite film is wound on axle 195 as the apparatus operates.2. Operation of the Apparatus In the apparatus shown in Figs. 1 17, the fiberreinforced composite film sheet of the invention is formed in four basic steps which are as follows A. forming a machine direction MD multi fiber planar lap 37 by 1 continuously drawing a plurality of machine direction MD fibers 27 from a plurality of bobbins 23, passing these MD fibers in longitudinally forward movement through a guide 22 and eyeboard 29 to converge the MD fibers vertically and spread them horizontally, thereby forming a first planar reach 37 of parallel, longitudinally aligned MD fibers after passing through a guide 36, and 2 moving the MD fibers obliquely upwardly as climbing reach 41 and converging reach 45 to reach convergence assembly 130 and became part of sandwich 140 B. forming a transverse direction TD single fiber planar lap by I drawing a single TD fiber from bobbins 51 at a high linear velocity, 2 passing this single TD fiber between spindles 90,90 of a pair of endless, spindle equipped chains 80,80 which cooperatively comprise an interweaving section 87, a diverging section 88, and a parallel section 89 while revolving in opposite directions as a pair of planar patterns which are parallel to the first planar lap, 3 engaging the single TD fiber 52 around the successively interweaving spindles 90,90 of the spindle equipped chains 80,80 to form a successive plurality of closely spaced taut loops 141 when each spindle of one chain 80,80 pulls the TD fiber toward and beyond the previously passing spindle of the other chain 80 ,80, and 4 laterally extending the single fiber 52, by longitudinal movement of chains 80,80 through diverging section 88, for trans versely separating loops 141 and forming two rows of loops connecting a plurality of closely spaced TD fiber reaches 58 which are trans versely disposed to longitudinally aligned MD fibers 37, and 5 continuing to move the TD fiber as transversely disposed TD reaches 59 and loops 141 of a second planar lap through parallel section 89 of the pair of chains 80,80 and into convergence assembly 130 see Figs. 7 and 10 C. straddling the MD and TD laps with a pair of films to form a sandwich 140 by I drawing a flattened tube from a supply Ill therefor and cutting its opposite edges with edge cutters 108 to form a pair of films 114,115, 2 forwardly passing the pair of films 114,115 as reaches 116,117 in straddling and parallel relationship to TD fibers 58 and MD fibers 41 see Fig. 5 , and 3 converging the films as reaches 118,119 toward TD reaches 59 and MD fibers 45 to form a fiber film sandwich 140 at con vergence assembly 130 and D. laminating sandwich 140, to form the film reinforced composite sheet of the invention in roll form, by 1 edge sealing sandwich 140 within narrow strips 146 see Fig. 15 , close to each side edge 148 but inwardly of the adjacent row of loops 141 by means of edge sealing assembly 150, 2 withdrawing taut loops 141 from spindles 90 by means of apparatus 160 to form relaxed loops 143, 3 transversely smoothing and stretch ing the withdrawn sandwich 140 by means of edge pulling assembly 170, 4 laminating sandwich 140, con sisting of longitudinally extending fibers 45, transversely disposed reaches 59, released loops 143, and the pair of films 118,119, to form the composite sheet 200 by means of laminating assembly 180, and 5 winding the laminated sheet com posite into rail 197 by means of winder assembly 190. More specifically, a plurality of MD fibers 24 are drawn from bobbins 23, passed horizontally through guide 22 and break detector 25 and convergingly into eyeboard 29, over idler rolls 33,35, through first set of MD fiber guides 36, and horizontally in the machine direction as parallel reaches 37. As best seen in Figs. 5 and 10, horizontally moving MD fibers 37 then pass beneath idler roll 39, move obliquely upwardly as reaches 41, go through fiber guides 43, climb more gradually as MD converging reaches 45 in adjacent relationship with lower film 119, and form a part of a sandwich 140 at convergence assembly 130. The single TD fiber 52 is pulled at a high velocity alternately from the pair of bobbins 51, which are disposed outside of the composite sheet forming apparatus, through first guide 55. As seen in Figs. 2 and 13, fiber 52 is then passed obliquely beneath turning bar 123 and above MD fibers 37 as reach 54, then through secondTD fiber guide 62 to TD fiber eyelet 63 while moving at an angle to the horizontal of about 200 as descending reach 57 to pass over revolvingly approaching spindles 90,90 which are attached to the pair of chains 80,801. Immediately after leaving eyelet 63, the TD fiber is between the interwoven spindles 90,90 and the respective roller chains 82,82 , as seen in Figs. 5,6, and 7, within interweaving section 87 of chains 80,80 . As spindles 90 revolvingly disengage from each other in the initial part of diverging section 88, theTD fiber begins to be pulled into lengthening reaches 58 throughout diverging section 88. Then, throughout parallel section 89, reaches 59 of uniform length are formed, each reach 59 being closely spaced and connected at each end by a taut loop l41 around one of spindles 90,90 to the succeeding and preceeding reaches 59. Fiber 52, as wound on bobbins 51, is suitably coated with a very thin layer of heat activated adhesive.The preferred fiber film adhesive is S2lGH of Morton ChemicalCo., which is applied as a 2 by weight solid solution, using trichioroethane as solvent. This solution is applied on both sides as 21 by wet weight of the fiber and is dried thoroughly before winding onto TD fiber bobbins 51.There is no adhesive action until heat is applied, the coated fiber 52 being fairly slippery over convex surfaces 98 of spindles 90. Fiber loops 141 are shown in Fig. 12 as sandwich 140 is passing through edge sealing assembly 150. With reference to the right side of the apparatus which is principally illustrated in the drawings, these loops 141 are lifted from spindles 90 by cams 161 while chains 80,80 are slightly approaching one another, as best seen in Fig. 4, while moving past relaxation sprockets 78,781 , and as the edge sealed sandwich is passing beneath idler roll 164 of sandwich pickup assembly 160. Although the released loops 143 and outer edge portions of films 145,147 droop over ledge 163 of cam 161 and tend to hang down while entering reach 167 during upward travel toward laminating assembly 180, as seen in Figs. 16 and 17, they are smoothed and pulled outwardly by edge pulling assembly 170, as seen in Fig. 5. As seen in Fig. 3, the collapsed tube of coextruded film is pulled from a roll 111 on film support stand 101 and passed over first idler roll 103 to a tension adjusting means comprising counter weighted arm 105, which is pivotably supported on dancer and slitter stand 102, and dancer idler roll 104. The flattened tube therefore leaves roll 111, passes over first idler roll 103, dancer idler roll 104, and second idler roll 103, whereby tension may be sensed and vertical tensioning reaches 112 may be adjusted by movement of arm 105. The flattened roll of film then passes under third idler roll 103 to edge slitters 108 as horizontal reach 113. The edges of the tube are slit in each apparatus 108 to form upper and lower films. The upper film then passes under and over rolls 106 to form upper reach 114, and the lower film passes over and under rolls 107 to form lower reach 115.Both reaches 114,115 pass through film turning assemblies 120. Specifically, as seen in Fig. 5, the upper film passes over and then under upper turning roll 123 and leaves as reach 116 which is oriented at 900 to reach 114. The upper film then passes over idler roll 126 and under expander roll 127 as slightly descending reach 118.The lower film passes under and then over turning roll 125 and proceeds as reach 117 to lower idler roll 128 and then over expander roll 129 as slightly ascending reach 119. The relationship of the lower film in reaches 117 and 119 to idler roll 128 and expander roll 129 may also be clearly viewed in Fig. 10. Returning to Fig. 5, film reaches 118,119,MD fiber reaches 45, and TD fiber reaches 59 converge into a single Sandwich 140 at convergence assembly 130 which is shown in section in Fig. 10 and in front elevation in Fig. 11. The films and fibers pass through the slot formed by the separated plates 131,132, beneath lower edge 137 and above upper edge 138, respectively, of edge plates 131,132 to form a closely juxtaposed sandwich 140 which proceeds to edge sealing assembly 150, as seen in Fig. 12. Operation of edge sealing assembly 150 creates a thin seal strip 146 along each edge of sandwich 140 but inwardly of tensioned loops 141 which are around spindles 90. A seal strip 146 is visible in Fig. 15. Consulting Fig. 2, it is apparent that sandwich 140 moves from edge sealing assembly 150 to film pickup assembly 160 which is shown in detail in Figs. 14 17.Chain assemblies 80,80 , as shown in Figs. 1 and 4, move slightly inwardly toward each other while passing between relaxation sprockets 78,78 . At this point, cams 161 are beneath sandwich 140 and idler roll 164 is directly thereabove. The relaxed sandwich 140 is then lifted on each side by ramp 162 of each cam 161 so that relaxed loops 143 are progressively lifted past tapered lift off surfaces 97 of spindles 90, while passing over top surfaces 166 of cams 161 and while being progressively raised by outwardly sloping ledges 163 of cams 161, until they hang down between edge film strips 145,147, as seen in Figs. 16 and 17.Cams 161 and relaxation sprockets 78,78 therefore function, in combination, as loop disengagement devices for taut loops 141, and roll 164, in combination with the elevated position of laminating assembly 180, functions as a pick up device for sandwich 140, whereby the edge sealed film sandwich can travel diagonally upwardly as reach 167. As seen inFig. 15 in combination with Fig. 5, while sandwich 140 moves obliquely upwardly as reach 167 toward the laminator, edges 148 extend beyond relaxed loops 143. En route to laminator 180, sandwich reach 161 is acted upon by edge puller assembly 170 which is visible in Fig. 5. Counter rotating brushes 171,173 engage tHe outer portions of sandwich 140 and pull strips 145,147, with relaxed loops 143 therebetween, outwardly while straightening out wrinkles in edge strips 145,147. Disposed along each edge of reach 167, between brushes 171,173 and laminator 180, are a pair of short Mt. Hope rolls 176. These rolls 176 are visible only in Fig. 5. They are disposed at about 100 to the machine direction and tauten the entire sandwich 140 transversely, just before it enters laminating assembly 180. While passing through laminating assembly 180, the entire sandwich 140 is softened by heat and pressure so that both films and both fibers are laminated together between rolls 181,183 to form the integral fiber reinforced composite sheet 200 which next passes under lower roll 183 and over selectively positioned idler roll 189 to leave laminating assembly 180 as reach 188 which then proceeds, as seen in Figs. 1 and 2, to winding assembly 190. In winding assembly 190, reach 188 is wound into a product roll 197 of a fiber reinforced composite film sheet 200 which can be stored and processed as desired to make shipping bags and bulk bags of any required strength and size characteristics. The width of sheet 200 can also be adjusted within selected limits without changing the overall pitch length of chain assemblies 80,80 . Such flexibility for width adjustment is an important requirement because of the varieties of bag widths that are used in the shipping sack industry. To achieve this flexibility, idler sprockets 78,78 and 76,76 on the inner sides of chain assemblies 80,80 , each end of convergence assembly 130, each pair of edge sealing rolls 151,152, each loop release cam 161, each pair of edge pulling brushes 171,173, and each pair of Mt.Hope tautening rolls 176 are all mounted on a single pair of horizontally and longitudinally disposed frame plates 46 which are slotted and adjustably attached to horizontal frame members 46 by bolts 44. The width adjustability that is achievable by sideways movement of these plates 46 can best be understood by referring to Figs. 9,11, and 12. The four edge sealing rolls 151,152 and the upper and lower laminating rolls 181,183 are generally heated by a hot oil system which utilizes a heating oil such asDowtherm A. A suitable heating and circulating system for this material comprises a storage tank containing theDowtherm A, a pump for circulating it, a heater, and a piping system for passing it through the heater into all four edge sealing rolls in parallel, into the laminating rolls in series, and back to the tanks. The system operates at about 30 psi. The edge sealing rolls are each about 12 inches in diameter and about two inches in width. The resulting fiber reinforced composite film sheet 200 is shown in Fig. 18 in plan view. MD fibers 201,TD reaches 203, TD loops 205, and both films 207 form a selectively strong product having one fourth the weight, much greater water resistance, improved tear and impact properties, and greater grease resistance as compared to a comparable product of paper construction. This composite sheet also has one half the weight, the ability to, utilize a sewn closure, breathability at the cost of minimal loss of strength, better strength and tear properties, more stiffness with no opening problems, hot filling capabilities, grease proofness, and better resistance to finger puncture as compared to comparable products of plastic construction. These comparisons are made for a fiber reinforced composite film sheet having a total average thickness of 2.5 mil, utilizing 0.25mil high density polyethylene and 0.75 mil low density polyethylene in combination with 500 denier polypropylene tape as both machine direction and transversedirection fibers. This composite film sheet derives a part of its novel strength properties from the 1800 loops 205 being entirely within and between the films 207 whenever its usage requires conjoining the edges of a single sheet as a lap seam to obtain greater width, as for making a bulk bag, or to produce a tubular bag, such as a shipping bag.3. Manufacture of a lap seam. Such a lap seam 210, with loops 215,225 in overlapping relationship, is shown in plan view in Fig. 19 and in section in Fig. 20. MD fibers 211 form a grid with TD reaches 213, and both fibers 211,213 are between and laminated to films 217,219 of the upper composite film sheet. MD fibers 221 form a grid with TD reaches 223, and both fibers 221,223 are between and laminated to films 227,229 of the lower composite film sheet. Loops 215 are inside edges 218 of upper films 217,219, and loops 225 is inside edges 228 of lower films 227,229. Loop overlap 224 is generally about 1.0 1.5 inches and preferably about 1.0 inch. Edge overlap 226 is generally 1.5 2.5 inches, preferably about 1.5 inches. Adhesive strips 216 are between films 219,227 and substantially coincide with loops 215,225.4. Manufacture of shipping bags. The fiber reinforced composite film sheet or fiber film laminate 200 of this invention is believed to be a bag making material having exceptional design flexibility for meeting a very wide variety of market needs. A number of diverse bags are accordingly manufactured and tested to meet such needs by forming various selected fiber reinforced composite film sheets of the invention into tubes of indefinite length, having lap seams as illustrated in Figs. 19 and 20. The tubes are then cut into required lengths and sewn at bottom and at top ends after filling with selected test materials, as described in the following example. Example L Bags made of 3 ply 50 lb. paper and 5 to 6 mil low density polyethylene LDPE are used in the marketplace for shipping and selling 50 Ibs. of such squashy products as mulch and some fertilizers. A fiber film laminate bag is produced from a 2.5 mil fiber film composite sheet 200 which is formed from 2 sheets of I mil film, reinforced in both directions with 500 denier polypropylene PP fiber, by using hot melt adhesive to conjoin sides thereof as a lap seam 210. The product is estimated to be satisfactory in its general characteristics for this use.Example 2 The 2.5 mil bag of Example I is tested with 50Ibis. of granular polyethylene PE resin. The results are unacceptable in the 6 side drop test because the drop performance is merely 4 feet. The bag is then manufactured with a fiber film laminate made of 500 denier MD fibers and 1000 denierTD fiber. The drop performance increases from 4 feet to 8 feet, making the bag satisfactory for the resin market currently served in Europe by 8 9 mil PE bags and by 5 ply paper bags in the U.S. one of the plys may be polyethylene .Example 3 Among 30 different mixes marketed by a large regional feed supplier, whole corn is regarded as the most difficult feed material to package safely. Fiber film laminate bags are manufaC tured with 500 denier MD fibers and l000 denier TD fiber The edge drop distance is 3 feet and is unacceptable. The bag is then manufactured with 1000 denier polypropylene fiber in the MD direction, and the resulting bag has an edge drop performance of 5 feet which is an acceptable height. This bag, comprising two 1 mil films plus I mil polypropylene fibers, is able to compete with a 4 mil all polypropylene woven fiber bag for handling 100Ibis. of whole corn.Example 4 In the initial concept of the fiber film laminate bag, it was felt that the loops at the laminate edge would add to the strength of the lap seam because in the event of a seam failure, each loop must pull through or out of the heat sealed sandwich and thus should add to the overall strength of the lap seam. There are more variables involved than simply loops vs. no loops for example, fiber to film bond strength and the weight of hot melt adhesive used to form the loop seam have an important effect on overall seam strength. Furthermore, the type of hot melt adhesive can make an important difference. Referring hereinafter to Figs. 19 and 20, a lap seam 210 is prepared from a fiber reinforced composite film sheet made from co extruded films 217,219,227,229 coextended from 80 low density polyethylene polyethylene 682 of Dow Chemical Co. and a blend of 14 high density polyethylene polyethylene TR 130 of Phillips Petroleum Co. and 6 polybutylene. The fiber film laminate is prepared by placing the low density polyethylene adjacent to fibers 211,221. The hot melt adhesive used for adhesive strips 216 is Munel 610 hot melt a adhesive of Gulf Oil Co. The fiberto film bond strength is 5 Ibis. per fiber inch of shear surface. TD fibers 213,223 are 0.375 inch apart, measured on centers. Test samples are prepared by cutting one inch wide strips from lap seam 210 in which the TD fibers are 3 8 apart. lii testing is done with two fibers in each lap of the seam by selectirz cutting of the test samples to provide an enclosed loop between the two fibers. In the case where the loops of each sample side are offset, the sample is cut to provide two TD fibers on one side and three TD fibers an the other side. The loops have a oneinch overlap in the transverse direction. The onerilch wide test samples are placed between the jaws of a tensile aEEseUng machine recording both stress and strain, with two inches of sample length exposed between the jays, The results are given in the first line of Table I. Nine sa1 are then cut from a lap seam 210 made with the same hot melt adhesive and the same film and fibers but with a different fiber adhesive furnishing 6.8Ibis. of bond strength per fiber inch of shear surface and with no loops within the seam area. The results are given in the second linF of Table I. TABLE IExample Loops Bond Strength, Break Force, Lbs. Elong. at No. No Loops Lbs.

The results are given in the fifth and sixth lines of Table I. The conclusions from these tests of Examples 4 6 are as follows 1 With a low fiber to film strength 5 ibis. per fiber inch of shear surface , loops add pproximately 308 to the force required to break the seam This is a bond strength level that would be expected with 500 denier fiber, using typical fiber adhesive under the best conditions. 2 With a higher bond strength of 7 to 8 Ibis. there is no advantage for the loops over straight fiber because breaking force is the same in both cases. This is a level of bond strength that would be expected with a 1000 denier fiber under optimum conditions. 3 Therefore, the advantages of the loop construction occurs a when using narrower fiber widths and or other fiber reinforcing materials such as monofilaments and multi filaments, wherein the area for adhesive bond between the film and the fibers is substantially reduced from that obtainable with 1000 denier polypropylene fiber, and b as insurance or back up protection for TD fibers of any denier, to protect against localized non deposition or unanticipated failure of the fiber adhesive.Example 7 Samples of a 3 ply paper bag, a 6 mil bag made of low density polyethylene LDPE , a 9 mil LDPE bag and a woven 1000 denier polypropylene PP bag are cut to obtain samples of their sheet materials which are subjected to the following six sheet characterization tests Yield ASTM D882 expressed in lbs inch of sample width is a measurement of the force the mate rial can take without permanent distortion and repre sents the static load carrying capability of the shipping sack material. The lesser of the MD and TD values is used. Dart drop ASTM D1709 measures in inch pounds the amount of energy required for a 1 1 2 diameter, 2 lb. ball to pass through a clamped film sample. This test is to evaluate the film s ability to absorb shock loads such as bag drop. PPT ASTM D2582 test measures the length of a tear caused by a one pound sharp projection which moves into and parallel to a 8 inch wide film sample after a 20 inch free drop. The result is converted to an average force in pounds required to make that length of tear. It is used as a measure of snag resistance. The lesser of the MD and TD values is used. Elmendorf initiated tear ASTM D1922 mea sures the average force in grams that it takes to propagate an initiated tear and is used to measure the film material s ability to prevent slight punctures from propagating to a large opening. The lesser of the MD and TD values is used. Puncture measures the force in pounds that it takes a 0.937 diameter head to penetrate through a clamped film sample. It is used as a measure of resistance to a finger or blunt object puncture. The 9 mil LDPE bag is a square bottomed bag, made on a Windmiller Holsher machine, which is the standard bag in Europe. The woven polypropylene bag is fabricated with sewn seams. Then single samples of these commercial bags are also subjected to the following four performance tests The progressive end drop is used to evaluate the bag material, as this test orientation results in the most severe loads on a given material at a given drop height. The procedure is to start at 2 ft. and continue to drop the same bag at progressively greater heights at one foot increments til the bag breaks. The progressive edge drop is used to check the bottom and top seams of the bag. At a given drop height, this test orientation results in the greatest loads on the end seams. The 6 side drop is specified in the heavy duty plastic bag specification adopted by some ship ping associations. In this test, a bag is dropped from a specified height, once on each end, once on each edge, and once on each face. Nine out of 10 bags should pass this test without failure. The results of the six sheet characterization tests and the three bag performance tests are given in the first four columns of Table II. Example 8 A fiber reinforced composite sheet 200 of this invention, more simply termed a fiber film laminate having an overall thickness of 2.5 mil and an appearance as seen in Figs. 18 and 19, is made from co extruded film of one mil thickness, which comprises 25 high density polyethylene HDPE and 75 of low density polyethylene LDPE , and from 500 denier MD and TD fibers. The laminate is subjected to the same six characterization tests. Then the laminate is formed into a tube of indefinite length, having a lap seam 210 as seen in Figs. 20 and 21, which is cut into suitable lengths for making shipping sacks. The lengths are sewn at their ends. They are subjected to the same three performance tests as inExample 7. The sheet characterization and bag performance test data are given in the fifth column of Table II. The results indicate superior characteristics and performance in most categories.Example 9 The same procedure is used in making a fiber film laminate having a 2.75 mil overall thickness, using the same co extruded film but with 500 denier MD fibers and 1000 denier TD fiber. The same characterization and performance tests are performed as in Examples 7 and 8. The data are given in the sixth column of Table II. It is apparent that the laminate has equivalent properties to the material used for the 9 mil LDPE bag, a Lthough drop performance is not quite as good.

It is evident that this fiber film laminate has equivalent performance to the woven PP bag. The sewn seam is the weak point of the woven PP bag.
