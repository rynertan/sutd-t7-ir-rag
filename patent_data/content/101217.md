# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO VALVE CAP DEVICES

## Abstract
The invention relates to a pilfer proof cap, for example for a beer container, which comprises two shell portions 4, 6 connected by a hinge 8 incorporating a tear strip, and capable of being secured round the valve of the container by a non releasable fastening means 14, 16 . When authorised opening of the container is required, the tab 12 of the tear strip is pulled away from the cap and releases the valve for use.
