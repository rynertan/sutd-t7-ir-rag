# A DATUM POINT LOCATOR

## Abstract
A datum point locator tool 12 , for use with a machine tool, comprises an assembly 14 to be located in the chuck or collet of a machine tool, said assembly including a protruding electrically conductive tip 16 which is movable from a position in which it rotates eccentrically relative to the axis of the chuck or collet to a position in which it rotates concentrically with the chuck or collet. The datum point locator additionally comprises a light source 30 and means for controllably illuminating the light source in response to the existence of non existence of contact between said tip and a workpiece, when said tool and said workpiece are mounted on a machine tool. Said light source 30 is mounted on the tool so that light from the light source emanates from the tool at a point spaced from the axis of rotation of the tool. In locating a datum point when using a machine tool, the datum point locator tool 12 is inserted in the chuck or collet of the tool, with the tip 16 thereof offset so that it rotates eccentrically. The workpiece is advanced towards the tool as it rotates, thus moving the tip 16 until it rotates concentric ally, and the light emitted by the light source 30 is observed, a steady state condition indicating that the datum point has been reached.
