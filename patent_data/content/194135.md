# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FINISHING WAISTBAND END PORTIONS

## Abstract
Improvements to a waistband end folding and stitching ap paratus of the type in which the open terminal free end portion of an unfinished waistband having opposed fabric plies is presented to a folding station where the end portion is 1 in verted into the space between the spread plies to form an in turned edge 2 the multiple plies of fabric are flattened by the application of pressure from a pair of opposed feet to facilitate sewing 3 automatically transferred laterally in a horizontal plane to a seaming or stitching station, and 4 positively posi tioned in alignment with the sewing head for the application of at least one row of stitches parallel to and adjacent the inturned edge. The moving parts of the apparatus are hydraulically and pneumatically operated responsive to the predetermined pro gram. At the end of the transfer stroke, the waistband end por tion is received by a gripping apparatus then shifted into posi tive engagement with a lower stripper plate in proper alignment with the needle for the stitching operation.
