# Device and method for detecting and measuring a gaseous anhydride.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and to an electro chemical device for detecting a gaseous anhydride and measuring its concentration in an oxygen containing gas, based on measurement of a difference of potential using a solid electrolyte junction 10 whereby the gas containing the gaseous anhydride to be detected does not necessarily come into contact with one of the metal electrodes 9, 11 that complete the electrochemical chain. This electrolytic junction 10 is brought into contact with the gas contain ing the gaseous an hydride to be detected so as to form a triple junction. The invention further provides a method for detecting a gaseous anhydride in a gas in which the partial pressure of oxygen varies independently of the total pressure or gas flow rate. The device supplies a continuous signal, in milli volts, which is proportional to be logarithm of the activity of the anhydride to be detected and can be easily corrected to take into account the partial pressure of the oxygen in gas containing the anhydride.
