# Process gas introduction, confinement and evacuation system for glow discharge deposition apparatus.

## Abstract
A system 70 for introducing, confining and evacuating process gases adjacent the cathode region of glow discharge deposition apparatus is disclosed, the apparatus being adapted to deposit at least one layer of semiconductor material onto a substrate 11 . The deposition apparatus includes at least one dedicated deposition chamber 28 into which process gases are introduced for glow discharge disassociation into species. The system 70 includes a baffling manifold 52 adjacent the cathode 34 , said manifold 52 adapted to substantially reduce areas of localized rarification and compression of process gases flowing through the plasma region for substantially preventing adjacent stagnant and rapidly moving areas of process gases from forming non uniform flow patterns as the semiconductor layer is deposited on the surface of the substrate 11 . The system 70 is also adapted to expose the entire transverse width of the substrate 11 for the deposition of semiconductor material thereunto.
