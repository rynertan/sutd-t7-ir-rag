Also included in this invention are the stereochemical isomers of the compounds of formula I which result from asymmetric centers contained therein. These isomeric forms may be prepared by chemical methods and are purified readily by crystallization or chromatography. Individual optical isomers, which might be separated by fractional crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts formed thereof, for instance, with d or l tartaric acid or D a bromocamphor sulfonic acid, are also included. The compounds of formula I are capable of forming acid addition salts with therapeutically acceptable acids. The acid addition salts are prepared by reacting the base form of the appropriate compound of formula I with one or more equivalents, preferably with an excess, of the appropriate acid in an organic solvent, for example, diethyl ether or an ethanol diethyl ether mixture. These salts, when administered to a mammal, possess the same pharmacologic activities as the corresponding bases. For many purposes it is preferable to administer the salts rather than the base compounds.Examples of suitable acids to form these salts include the common mineral acids, e.g., hydrohalic, sulfuric or phosphoric acids the organic acids, e.g., formic, acetic, maleic, methanesulfonic, malic, citric, or tartaric acid and acids which are sparingly soluble in body fluids and which impart slow release properties to their respective salts, e g., pamoic acid, tannic acid or carboxy methyl cellulose. The addition salts thus obtained are the functional equivalent of the parent base compound in respect to their therapeutic use. Hence, these addition salts are included within the scope of this invention and are limited only by the requirement that the acids employed in forming the salts be therapeutically acceptable. The discovery in the mid 1960 s of two major dopamine DA systems indicated that this neurotransmitter exerted control over a number of physio logical functions. Against this background an interest arose to develop DA receptor agonists to study the function of the dopaminergic systems and to evaluate these agonists as possible therapeutic agents in Parkinson s disease and certain neuroendocrine disorders, for example, hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, impotence, hypertension and other central nervous system disorders. The DA receptor agonists exert a variety of pharmacological effects, some of the most characteristic being the ones that occur in animals in which DA deficiency is brought about to mimic the Parkinsonian syndrome.An important model was developed by U. Ungerstedt, Acta. Physiol. Scand.,Suppl. 367, 69 93 1971 who, by means of unilateral injections of 8 hydroxy dopamine 6 OHDA into the DA pathway, could produce selective lesions of the ascending DA pathways on one side of the brain. Ungerstedt 1971 demonstrated in these lesioned rats that DA receptor agonists induced rotational behavior towards the innervated side. The response is due to the development of receptor supersensitivity in the denervated striatum resulting in a higher degree of DA receptor activity on the denervated as compared to the innervated side after treatment with DA receptor agonists. Due to this imbalance between the two sides, a rotational behavior is elicited, the direction being always towards the less activated side.It is of interest that in the discovery of the DA receptor stimulating properties of bromocriptine, the 6 OHDA rotational model was utilized H. Corrodi et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 25, 409 412 1973 j. In the test for rotational behavior in rats following the unilateral 6 OHDA induced destruction of one nigrostriatal pathway, the method described by C.J. Pycock and C.D. Marsden, Europ. J. Pharmacol., 47, 167 1978 was followed. The rats 230 250 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 40 mg kg i.p. and intracerebral injections were made using a Stoelting stereotaxic instrument, C.H. Stoelting Co., Chicago, Ill., U.S.A. .Unilateral injections of 6KHDA hydrobromide 8 lug 3 lil delivered at a rate of 1 ul per min were made into the ascending median forebrain bundle MFB in the lateral hypo made into the ascending median forebrain bundle MFB in the lateral hypothalamus according to the coordinates of the De Groot brain atlas, J. DeGroot, Verhandel, Koninkl. Ned. Akad. Wetenschap. Natuurk. 52 1 40 1959 , A 4.6, L 1.9, V 2.71 6 OHDA was made up in ice cold distilled water containing 0.2 mg ml ascorbic acid Three weeks after operation, the rats were tested for rotational behavior in response to apomorphine hydrochloride 0.25 mg kg, s.c. .Rats which consistently showed more than 5 turns min after apomorphine were selected and the compound of formula I was then administered. The rat was immediately placed in the rotometer, described by K. Voith and J.R. Cummings,Can. J.

Barbeau,Eds., Raven Press, New York, pp. 427 432 1974 , shows that rats exhibit almost complete akinesia in an open field following the bilateral injection of 6 OHDA into the anterolateral hypothalamus. The compounds of formula I can reverse this 6 OHDA induced hypokinesia as a result of their functioning as dopamine receptor qonists. In this test for dopamine receptor agonists, the compounds of formula I can exhibit a pharmacological response that is comparable to that of apomophine and bromocriptine. Experiments are performed on male Sprague Dawley rats housed in air conditioned quarters. The room is lighted between 0700 and 1900 hr daily and maintained at a temperature of 24 C 20 C. The method of Smith and Young, cited above, is followed. Rats approximately 280 g are operated on under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia.Using a Stoelting stereotaxic instrument, the tip of a 26 gauge cannula is positioned in the anterolateral hypothalamus 7 mm anterior to the interaural line, 2 mm lateral to the midline and 8 mm below the dura according to theDe Groot brain atlas, noted above. Via a polyethylene tubing PE 20 , the cannula is connected to a 10 p1 syringe which is mounted in a Starrett micrometer head drive, C.H. Stoelting Co., Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. All injections are bilateral.Each injection consisted of 4 iil of distilled water containing 6 OHDA 6.5 ug base ul and ascorbic acid 0.4 ug ul . The animals have free access to Purina Laboratory Chow pellets and tap water. However since anterolateral hypothalamic 6 OHDA injections produce aphagia and adipsia, intragastric feeding is necessary in order to prevent drastic weight loss. The rats receive a daily gastric intubation of 2 g of the modified rat tube feeding diet ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A mixed with approximately 2 ml tap water. Ambulation in the open field is evaluated in an apparatus consisting of a wooden box 69 cm x 69 cm x 42 cm with an arborite floor. The floor is divided into 36 squares ll.5 cm x 1l. 5 cm . The placement of all four limbs in one square is taken as one ambulation score. In the present experiments all compounds are evaluated four days after the intracerebral injection of 6 OHDA. The rat is placed into the center of the open field and observed for a 2 min period. Only rats with almost total akinesia are used. Apomorphine, bromocriptine or the compounds of formulaI are injected s.c. to groups of 4 12 rats. Subsequently, the number of squares are counted which the animal entered during several 2 min observation periods.Apomorphine is evaluated at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min bromocriptine at 2, 3, 4,5,6 and 7 hr and the compoundsofformulal at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection. Each animal is used only once. The results are expressed as cumulative number of ambulation scores, which are the sums of the scores obtained during the 2 min observation periods. The following substances are used apomorphine hydrochloride Macfarlan Smith Ltd.,Edinburgh, Scotland , bromocriptine CB l54 Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, N.J., U.S.A and 6KHDA hydrobromide AldrichChemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. . The compounds are dissolved in distilled water or suspended in distilled water with a few drops of polysorbate 80 Tween 80 Tween is a registered trade mark . If the compound is an oil, 0.4 ml of dim ethyl sulfoxide is added. Solutions are prepared fresh on the day of the experiment. The 6KHDA solution is kept in ice throughout the injection procedure. All doses refer to the base. Using the above described method, apomorphine at a dose of 0.5 mg kg exhibits a score of 135 41 and bromocriptine at a dose of 10 mg kg exhibits a score of 112 23. Similarly, the following compound of formula I is an effective dopamine receptor agonist, 6,7,8,9 tetrahydro N,N dipropyl 3H benz e indol 7 amine at a subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg kg of body weight exhibited a cumulative ambulation score of 155 28 , 6,7,8,9 tetrahydro N,N dipropyl 3H benz el indoF8 amine at a subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg kg of body weight exhibited a cumulative ambulation score of 287 109 , and 6,7,8,9 tetrahydro 3 methyl N,N dipropyl 3H benz el indol 8 amine at a subcutaneous dose of 10 mgjkg of body weight exhibited a cumulative ambulation score of 68 34 . The above described test methods for dopamine receptor agonists show that the compounds of formula I are active as dopamine receptor agonists.The compounds, thus, can be used clinically in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea. impotence, diabetes, Parkinsonism, acromegaly, hypertension and other central nervous system disorders, which respond to dopamine receptor stimulation. The compounds of formula I of this invention are used alone or in combination with pharmacologically acceptable carriers, the proportion of which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of administration and standard biological practice. For example, they are administered orally in solid form i.e. capsule or tablet. They can also be administered orally in the form of suspensions or solutions or they may be injected parenterally. For parenteral administration they can be used in the form of a sterile solution containing other solutes, for example, enough saline or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The tablet compositions contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutical excipients known to be suitable in the manufacture of tablets. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients are, for example, starch, milk sugar, certain types of clay and so forth. The tablets can be uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques so as to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. The aqueous suspensions of the compounds of formula I contain the active ingredient in admixture with one or more non toxic pharmaceutical excipients known to be suitable in the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.Suitable excipients are, for example, methylcellulose, sodium alginate, gum acacia, lecithin and so forth. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents. Non aqueous suspensions can be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin, and the suspension may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. These compositions can also contain a sweetening agent, flavoring agent and antioxidant. The dosage of the compounds of formula I as dopamine receptor agonists will vary with the form of administration and the particular compound chosen. Furthermore, it will vary with the particular host as well as the age, weight and condition of the host under treatment as well as with the nature and extent of the symptoms. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compounds of this invention are most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects. For example, the effective dopamine receptor stimulating amount of the compounds for i.p.administration usually ranges from about 0.1 mg to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses although as aforementioned variations will occur. However a dosage level that is in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses is employed most desirably for i.p. administration in order to achieve effective results. For oral administration, effective amounts can range from about 0.5 to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses preferably about 1.0 to 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. The compound of formula I, or a therapeutically acceptable salt thereof, also can be used to produce beneficial effects in the treatment ofParkinsonism, hyperprolactinemia and related disorders when combined with a therapeutically effective amount of an agent commonly used in the treatment of Parkinsonism, hyperprolactinemia and related disorders.Such agents include, for example, apomorphine and its derivatives, piribedil and its derivatives, dopaminergic ergot derivatives, especially bromocriptine and lergotrile, 2 amino 6 ,7 dihydroxy l,2 ,3 ,4tetrahydronaphthalene ADTN , levodihydroxyphenylalanine levodopa , combination of levodopa with carbidopa, Irprolyl Irleucylglycinamide MIF and its derivatives, especially L prolyl N methyl D Ieucylglycinamide pareptide , biperiden, cycrimine hydrochloride, procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, benztropine mesylate, chiorphenoxamine hydrochloride, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, orphenadrine hydrochloride, ethopropazine hydrochloride and the enzymes, monoamine oxidase B and catecholVmethyl transferase.
