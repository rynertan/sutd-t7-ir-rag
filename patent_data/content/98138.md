# MICROBIAL CELLS AND THE USE THEREOF TO PRODUCE OXIDATION PRODUCTS

## Abstract
Newly discovered and isolated microorganism strains and their natural mutants and genetically engineered deriva tives are capable of growth under aerobic conditions in a culture medium containing a C₂ C₁₀ alkane or a C₂ C₁₀ alkyl radical donating compound as their major carbon and energy source. These microbial cells, which possess a high content of protein, can be utilized as feedstuffs or in oxidizing oxidizable organic substrates containing at least two carbon atoms, for example, converting alkanes and alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons to alcohols and or ketones, alkenes, dienes, and vinyl aromatic compounds to 1,2 epoxides, and secondary alcohols to methyl ketones. Genetically en gineered derivatives and enzyme preparations derived from these microbial cells may also be employed in the oxidative conversions.
