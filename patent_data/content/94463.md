A parallel beam of light P is established between the opposing walls of guide members M of the measuring gate 2 , which are provided with slits S for emission and reception of the parallel beam. To remove or prevent the collection of particulate contaminant on the optical components 4, 5, 6, 7 within the gauging head 1 the guide members M have internal ducts D so that air may be directed to the ducts D and passed through each opposing slit S to set up a curtain of air across the measuring gate 2 thus repelling particulate contaminant floating in the guideway which would otherwise enter the slits S .

## Description
Optical Measuring Apparatus FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to an optical measuring device and particularly to such a device for determining the dimensional properties of an article. BACKGROUND ARTOptical instruments for use in measuring the dimensional properties of various articles statistically or dynamically such as for example the dimensional properties of cables, grass fibres, glass rods, alluminium and steel profiles produced by extrusion, are known.The ability to take accurate measurements on such devices has proved difficult due to the presence of floating particles which are prone to collect on the optical components of the measuring device. Such particles can be in the form of dust, chalk, steam, water droplets, fungus, oil and smoke fumes, all of which can normally be found in industrial environments.Hence in prior devices, in order to maintain accuracy, the optical surfaces.of the optical components making up the measuring device, have to be frequently dismantled and carefully cleaned. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of the invention therefore to eliminate the disadvantages of the prior art and to provide an optical measuring device which is capable of providing highly accurate measurements while obviating the need to dismantle the apparatus at frequent intervals to clean the optical components.According to. the invention tnere is provided an optical measuring device for calculating a dimensional property of an article from the shadow produced by the article passing through a light beam and comprising a gauging head formed with a guideway for passing an article to be optically measured,opposing slits in a pair of spaced guide members of the guideway in communication with the interior of the gauging head, through which light is emitted and received respectively by an optical system within the gauging head to establish said beam of light across the guideway characterised in that each guide member is provided with internal ducting for directing a particlefree gaseous medium through the opposing slits to the guideway thereby to set up a particle free gaseous curtain across the guideway and prevent contaminating matter from entering said slits.The advantage of this arrangement is that since there is a continuous supply of particle free gas, preferably air, across the guideway unwanted floating matter is unable to reach the optical components of the device thus preventing them settling on these components and effecting accuracy of the measurements.In particular the ingress of particles into the slits and thus onto the optical components of the device is prevented by the opposing draught of air emanating from the slits.Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the description that follows and illustrated in the drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSAn embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example with refrence to the accompanying drawings wherein Figures 1 and 2 illustrate schematically an optical measuring device according to the prior art andFigures 3 and 4 illustrate schematically an optical measuring device according to the invention. BEST MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONThe prior art optical measuring device shown in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a gauging head l having an optical measuring gate 2 forming a guideway G for passage of an elongate article 3 whose dimensional properties are to be determined.The gate 2 is composed of two guide members M to each side of the guideway G , the members M being arranged such that respective wall surfaces W face one another across the guideway G .Each wall surface W is provided with a narrow slit S the slits S being in optical communication through its associated member M , with the interior of the gauging head 1 .An optical system is mounted within the gauging head 1 as will be seen from Figure 2. The optical system comprises a light source 4 , and pair of lenses 5 one on each side of the guideway G .A beam of light is projected from the light source 4 to the first of the lenses 5 through two scanning mirrors the second mirror in the light path from the light source 4 being positioned on the optical axis of the first of the lenses 5 so that said first lens projects a parallel beam of light P across the guideway G through one of the slits S and is received by the second of the lenses 5 which focuses the beam onto a photocell 7 , through the other slit S . The photoell 7 is connected by leads 8 to an indicator unit 9 having a digital display 10 and a parameter deviation meter 11 .The article 3 intercepts the parallel light beam P and its presence causes a shadow to fall on the second of the lenses 5 which is picked up by the photocell 7 , the shadow or dark portion corresponding to the diameter, in the example shown, of the article 3 passing along the guideway G .The optical light and dark portions are converted to electrical signals by the photocell 7 and fed via the leads 8 to the indicator unit 9 which performs electronic calculations to relate the shadow to the dimension being measured.In the example shown the actual diameter is displayed on the digital display 10 and any deviation in diameter as the article 3 passes through the guideway 5 is shown on the meter 11 .With the prior art device as described above difficulties are experienced in obtaining highly accurate measurements and these are due to the build up of contaminants on the electrical components of the lens mirror system 4,5 and 6 . Such foreign matter floating freely in the optical gate 2 of the gauge head 1 , will find its way naturally through the narrow slits S through which the light beam passes to eventually deposit on the lenses 5 and mirrors 6 and after a while forming an opaque surface impairing light transmission.In order to restore the situation the lenses and optical surfaces have to be periodically removed from the gauging head 1 which of necessity is time consuming and not wholly effective.These problems have been overcome by the invention as depicted by way of example to Figures 3 and 4. This device relies on a clean curtain of air being at all times present at the measuring gate 2 , this curtain of air having the capability of repelling all unwanted particles in free flight in that area from entering the two narrow slits S in the measuring gate 2 and fouling the internally mounted optical components.To this end each guide member M is provided with internal ducting D for directing a gaseous medium, preferably air, through the guide members M to the slits S , and thus in the path of the light beam P , to set up opposing draughts of air across the guideway.To achieve the delivery of particle free air to the ducting D , a pneumatic system is employed as shown in Figures 3 and 4 comprising a filter 12 , a pneumatic pump 13 for drawing air from ambient through the filter 12 , and a duct 14 for ducting the air to the measuring gate 2 . The duct 14 is connected to branched passageways 15 at the base of the guideway G , the branched passageways 15 being integrally formed with an associated guide member M , and leading to the internal ducting D therein.Since the air in passing from the internal ducting D in a respective guide member M to atmosphere, does so through the narrow slits S which act as restrictions, the consequent air pressure build up with the ducting D and upstream of the slits S , acts as an additional repellent to the ingress of dust particles and similar contaminatory materials from entering the slits S and settling on the optical components of the device. In use the pump 13 sucks air from the atmosphere through the fine filters 12 where all particles which would normally be in free flight are trapped. The pump 13 delivers air which has been totally cleaned and free from particulate contamination through the delivery duct 14 and the measuring gate 2 .Thus it will be appreciated that the problems of the prior art device are eliminated in that the need to clean the lenses and other optical components does not become necessary during a measuring operation and therefore continuous measuring is possible freed from maintenance and reading inaccuracies.
