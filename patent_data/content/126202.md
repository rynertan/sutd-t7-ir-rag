# Brassiere and method of making same.

## Abstract
A molded brassiere formed of a thin fabric includes a nipple patch or cover smoothly adhered to an apex portion 19 of each breast cup 18 to impart a pleasing and modest appearance. The nipple patch 20 is sized, shaped and of an opacity to comfortably cover the nipples and surrounding areola. Further, the nipple patch is sufficiently rigid to de press the nipples, which might otherwise protrude through the thin cup fabric and, thereby, provide a smooth contour along the natural arc line of the bust. The method of making the breast cup of the brassiere is easily and simply accomplished by juxtaposedly position ing a coated patch fabric 20 onto a central portion of the flat cup fabric 19 and simultaneously adhering and mold ing the fabrics at preselected temperatures to form an uni tary, three dimensional breast cup including the nipple patch.
