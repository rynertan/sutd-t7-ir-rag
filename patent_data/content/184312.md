# APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING A VEHICLE WINDOW WIPER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A control apparatus for separately driven, potentially interfering wiper blades 11, 14 includes position sensors 24, 25 for each wiper blade and a memory 23 which stores, for each pattern, numbers representing inner 26, 27 and outer 26 27 wipe positions with acceleration, constant velocity and deceleration regions therebetween and a com mand velocity for the constant velocity regions. The memory further stores numbers defining a zone 29 27 , 26 28 of potential blade interference and, for each position of each blade within this zone, a non interference zone 27 29, 28 26 for the other blade. The control apparatus further includes closed loop velocity control apparatus 18, 21, 23 responsive to the signals from the position sensors and the command velocity to maintain the command velocity in the constant velocity region, accelerate to the command velocity in the acceleration region and decelerate from the command velocity in the deceleration region. The control apparatus also synchronizes the wiper blades at each of the inner and outer wipe positions and includes apparatus responsive to signals from the position sensors indicating that both of the blades are within the zone of potential blade interference to derive from the memory, for the position of the blade in advance in the direction of common blade movement, the non interference zone for the other blade and prevent the other blade from leaving this zone.
