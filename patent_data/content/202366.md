# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR STERILIZING ARTICLES

## Abstract
In a method of sterilization an article to be sterilized is suspended over a water bath through which ozone is bubbled, the moist ozone contacting the article. The article is then immersed in the water and subjected to ultrasonic vibration for short periods to dislodge the bacteria and improve water article contact whilst ozone is bubbled through the water. The method has been found to kill even the most difficult bacteria end spores in shorter times than ethylene oxide sterilizers and which can be used for instruments which cannot stand steam temperatures or pressure changes. Because no pressure chamber or heat is required, the sterilizer is much lighter, portable, and cheaper.
