# Preparation of magnetic catalysts, and hydrocarbon reforming process using the magnetic catalyst.

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of a magnetic catalyst, parti cularly a magnetic reforming catalyst, in which a Group VIII no ble metal is incorporated within an inorganic oxide particulate mass, suitably by impregnation of preformed particles com prising the inorganic oxide. The metal containing inorganic ox ide particulate mass, in the desired proportion, is then ad mixed with magnetic alloy particles notably iron alloy or cobalt alloy and an inorganic oxide precursor which serves as a bin der, to form a particulate composite mass comprised of parti cles of magnetic alloy dispersed as inclusions within an inor ganic oxide matrix. The particulate composite mass is dried and fired. The method of preparation avoids plating out of the noble metal on the magnetic alloy. When used in a reforming process, particles of the cata lyst are fluidized in a bed by a hydrocarbon feed and hydrogen while being subjected to an applied magnetic field which stabi lizes the fluidized bed.
