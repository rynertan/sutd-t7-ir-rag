## Description
The present invention relates to binder compositions and methods for making, curing, and using such binder compositions. The binder compositions of the present invention are especially useful as molding compositions such as for making refractory and or abrasive articles and for molding shapes such as cores and molds. The preferred binder compositions of the present invention are especially useful in obtaining foundry shapes. The binder compositions are capable of being cured at room temperature by a basic curing agent. US A 3,409,579 and 3,676,392 disclose binder compositions made available as two package systems comprising a resin component in one package and a hardener component in the other package. The resin component comprises an organic solvent solution of phenolic resin. The hardener component comprises a liquid polyisocyanate having at least two isocyanate groups per molecule. At the time of use the contents of the two packages may be combined first and then mixed with the sand aggregate or preferably, the packages are sequentially admixed with sand aggregate. After a uniform distribution of the binder on the sand particles has been obtained, the resulting foundry mix is molded into the desired shape. In US A 3,409,579 the molded shape is cured by passing a gaseous tertiary amine through it. In US A 3,676,392 curing is effected by means of a base having a pKb value in the range of about 7 to about 11 as determined by a method described by D.D. Perrin in Dissociation Constants of Organic Bases in Aqueous Solution Butterworths, London 1965 . The base is introduced originally into the resin component before it is mixed with hardener or it may be introduced as the third component of a three package binder system comprising, in separate packages, the resin component, the hardener, and the base. In both US A 3,409,579 and 3,676,392 the preferred phenolic resins are condensation products of a phenol having the general formula wherein A, B, and C are hydrogen, hydrocarbon radicals, oxyhydrocarbon radicals, or halogen with an aldehyde having the general formula R CHO wherein R is a hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, prepared in the liquid phase under substantially anhydrous conditions at temperatures below about 130 C in the presence of catalytic concentrations of a metal ion dissolved in the reaction medium. The preparation and characterization of these resins are disclosed in greater detail in US A 3,485,797. The phenolic resin component of the binder composition is, as indicated above, generally employed as a solution in an organic solvent. The second component, or package, of the binder composition comprises an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic polyisocyanate having preferably from 2 to 5 isocyanate groups. If desired, mixtures of polyisocyanates can be employed. Less preferably, isocyanate prepolymers formed by reacting excess polyisocyanate with a polyhydric alcohol, e.g., a prepolymer of toluene diisocyanate and ethylene glycol, can be employed. Suitable polyisocyanates include the aliphatic polyisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, alicyclic polyisocyanates such as 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and aromatic polyisocyanates such as 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and dimethyl derivatives thereof. Further examples of suitable polyisocyanates are 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, and the methyl derivatives thereof, polymethylenepolyphenyl isocyanates, chlorophenylene 2,4 diisocyanate, and the like. Although all polyisocyanates react with the phenolic resin to form a cross linked polymer structure, the preferred polyisocyanates are aromatic polyisocyanates and particularly, polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The polyisocyanate is employed in sufficient concentrations to cause the curing of the phenolic resin. In general, the polyisocyanate will be employed in a range of 10 to 500 weight per cent of polyisocyanate based on the weight of the phenolic resin. Preferably, from 20 to 300 weight per cent of polyisocyanate on the same basis is employed. The polyisocyanate is employed in liquid form. Liquid polyisocyanates can be employed in undiluted form. Solid or viscous polyisocyanates are employed in the form of organic solvent solutions, the solvent being present in a range of up to 80 by weight of the solution. The general state of the art in this matter of solvents has remained static over a long period and is well set out, firstly a long time back in US A 3,409,579 and 3,676,392, then more recently in US A 4,268,425 and finally very recently in EP A 169882. The teaching in those references is specifically that the difference in the polarity between the polyisocyanate and the phenolic resin restricts the choice of solvents in which both components are compatible. Such compatibility is necessary to achieve complete reaction and curing of the binder compositions. Polar solvents of either the protic or aprotic type are good solvents for the phenolic resin, but have limited compatibility with the polyisocyanates. Aromatic solvents, although compatible with the polyisocyanates, are less compatible with the phenolic resins. It is therefore recommended to employ particularly combinations of aromatic and polar solvents. In fact, a number of patents concerned with systems of the type disclosed in US A 3,409,579 and 3,676,392 are directed to specific polar solvent additives. Such patents include US A 4,273,179 3,905,937 and 4,246,157. Finally, there should perhaps be mentioned US A No. 3,429,848 representing an earlier less developed state of the art in which the solvents suggested were ethers, esters, ordinary mineral spirits and kerosene. That teaching did not even recognise the requirement to use aromatic solvents for compatibility with the polyisocyanates. According to the present invention, there is provided a binder composition consisting of, in admixture, a resin component, a hardener component and optionally common additives, for curing by means of a basic curing catalyst said resin component consisting of a solution of a substantially non aqueous phenolic resin, i.e. containing less than 5 by weight of water, in an organic solvent medium the resin being a condensation product of a phenol having the general formula where A, B, and C are hydrogen, hydrocarbon radicals, or halogen, with an aldehyde having the general formula R CHO where R is a hydrogen or hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 8 carbon atoms wherein at least 1 mole percent of said phenol is an alkyl substituted phenol, and the organic solvent medium is at least 77.3 per cent by weight of aromatic hydrocarbons but contains no more than a maximum of 1.5 by weight of polar solvents based upon the weight of the phenolic resin and said hardener component being in liquid form and consisting of a polyisocyanate containing at least two isocyanate groups per molecule and optionally a solvent being at least 50 by weight aromatic but containing no more than a maximum of 1.5 by weight of polar solvents based on the weight of the polyisocyanate. The curing catalyst is preferably a gaseous tertiary amine or a base having a pKb value of 7 to 11. Preferably, at least 5 mole percent of the phenol and more preferably 10 50 mole percent of the phenol is an alkyl substituted phenol, more particularly an alkyl phenol containing 1 to 26 carbon atoms. It has been found, in accordance with the present invention, that when the phenol resin is from a phenol constituent containing at least 1 mole percent of an alkyl phenol, contrary to the prior art teachings, it is not necessary to employ a polar solvent in the solvent combination for compatibility with the phenol. The solvent medium of the resin component can be substantially free from polar solvents. The present invention is also concerned with molding compositions which comprise a major amount of aggregate and an effective bonding amount of up to 40 by weight of the binder composition described hereinabove based on the weight of the aggregate. Moreover, the present invention is concerned with a process for fabricating foundry shapes which comprises mixing foundry aggregate with a bonding amount of up to 10 by weight of the binder composition described hereinabove based upon the weight of the aggregate. The foundry mix is introduced into a pattern and hardened to become self supporting. The shaped foundry mix is removed from the pattern and allowed to further cure to thereby obtain a hard, solid, cured foundry shape. Furthermore, the present invention is concerned with a process for casting a metal. The process comprises fabricating a foundry shape as discussed hereinabove and pouring the metal while in the liquid or molten state into or around the shape. The metal is allowed to cool and solidify and the molded metal article is then separated from the foundry shape. The binder compositions used in the practice of the invention contain certain phenolic resins and polyisocyanate combinations. Such phenolic isocyanate binder systems are admixed at or about the time of use in the presence of sand. Typically, the reactive ingredients of such binder compositions are sold, shipped, and stored in separate packages i.e., a multiple package core binder to avoid undesirable deterioration due to premature reaction between the components. Catalysts, various additives, and other known binders can optionally be used in conjunction with the phenolic resin and the isocyanate. The phenol content of the phenolic resins employed includes at least 1 mole percent, preferably from 5 to 100 mole percent, more preferably 5 to 80 mole percent of an alkyl phenol, and most preferably, 5 to 50 mole percent of an alkyl phenol. The alkyl group preferably contains 1 to 26 carbon atoms and, most preferably, 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable alkyl substituted phenols include 2,6 xylenol, o cresol, m cresol, p cresol, 3,5 xylenol, 3,4 xylenol, 2,3,4 trimethyl phenol, 3 ethyl phenol, 3,5 diethyl phenol, p butyl phenol, 3,5 dibutyl phenol, p amyl phenol, p octyl phenol, dodecyl phenol, and nonyl phenols such as paranonyl phenol. The preferred alkyl substituted phenols include the cresols and the nonyl phenols and, most preferably, o cresol and p nonyl phenol. Mixtures of alkyl phenols can be used, if desired. The phenolic resins are substantially free of water and are organic solvent soluble. In addition to containing at least one alkyl phenol, the phenolic component may include any one or more of the phenols which have heretofore been employed in the formation of phenolic resins and which are not substituted at either the two ortho positions or at one ortho and the para position, such unsubstituted positions being necessary for the polymerization reaction. Any one, all, or none of the remaining carbon atoms of the phenol ring can be substituted. The nature of the substituent can vary widely, and it is only necessary that the substituent not interfere in the polymerization of the aldehyde with the phenol at the ortho and or para positions. Substituted phenols employed in the formation of the phenolic resins include aryl substituted phenols, cyclo alkyl substituted phenols, alkenyl substituted phenols, alkoxy substituted phenols, aryloxy substituted phenols, and halogen substituted phenols, the foregoing substituents containing from 1 to 26 and preferably from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Specific examples of suitable phenols, in addition to the alkyl phenols, include phenol, cyclohexyl phenol, 3,5 dicyclohexyl phenol, p phenyl phenol, 3,5 dimethoxy phenol, 3,4,5 trimethoxy phenol, p ethoxy phenol, p butoxy phenol, 3 methyl 4 methoxy phenol, and p phenoxy phenol. Such phenols can be described by the general formula wherein A, B, and C are hydrogen, hydrocarbon radicals, oxyhydrocarbon radicals, or halogen. The preferred phenol component employed is a mixture of one or more of these phenols with the alkyl phenols. The phenol component is reacted with an aldehyde to form phenolic resins, more preferably, benzylic ether resins. The aldehydes reacted with the phenol can include any of the aldehydes heretofore employed in the formation of phenolic resins such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, furfuraldehyde, and benzaldehyde. In general, the aldehydes employed have the formula R CHO wherein R is a hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 8 carbon atoms. The most preferred aldehyde is formaldehyde in its aqueous forms or in the paraformaldehyde form. If desired, the reaction mass for the preparation of the phenolic resins can include other reactants such as difunctional phenolic materials including resorcinol, hydroquinone, and the bisphenols e.g., bisphenol A, bisphenol C, and bisphenol F . The phenolic resins employed in the binder compositions can be either resole or A stage resins or novolak resins. The resitole or B stage resins, which are a more highly polymerized form of resole resins, are generally unsuitable. The phenolic resin employed must be liquid or organic solvent soluble. Solubility in organic solvent is desirable to achieve uniform distribution of the binder on the aggregate. The substantial absence of water in the phenolic resin is desirable in view of the reactivity with water of the binder composition of the present invention. The term non aqueous or substantially water free, as employed herein, is meant to define a phenolic resin which contains less than 5 percent water and preferably less than 1 percent water based on the weight of the resin. Mixtures of phenolic resins can be used. Both the resole resins and the novolak resins can be employed in the binder compositions of the present invention and, when admixed with polyisocyanates and a foundry aggregate and cured by use of catalysts, form cores of sufficient strength and other properties to be suitable in industrial applications. The resole resins are preferred over the novolak resins. The preparation of resole resins is known in the art and, for that reason, is not specifically referred to herein. By phenolic resin is meant the reaction products of a phenol with an aldehyde in which the final mixture of molecules in the reaction products is dependent upon the specific reactants selected, the starting ratio of these reactants, and the conditions of the reaction for example, the type of catalyst, the time and temperature of the reaction, the solvents and or other ingredients present, and so forth . The reaction products, that is, the phenolic resin, will be a mixture of different molecules and may contain, in widely varying ratios, addition products, condensation products, and unreacted reactants such as unreacted phenol and or unreacted aldehyde. By addition product is meant reaction products in which an organic group has been substituted for at least one hydrogen of a previously unreacted phenol or of a condensation product. By condensation product is meant reaction products with two or more benzene rings. The phenolic resin component of the binder composition is employed as a solution in an organic solvent. The nature and the effect of the solvent will be more specifically described below. The amount of solvent used should be sufficient to result in a binder composition permitting uniform coating thereof on the aggregate and uniform reaction of the mixture. The specific solvent concentrations for the phenolic resins will vary depending on the type of phenolic resins employed and its molecular weight. In general, the solvent concentration will be in the range of up to 80 percent by weight of the resin solution and preferably in the range of 20 to 80 percent. It is preferred to keep the viscosity of the phenolic component at less than X 1 on the Gardner Holt Scale. The solvent constituent of the resin component is substantially free from polar solvents. Substantially free from polar solvents means a maximum of 1.5 percent by weight of polar solvent based upon the weight of the phenolic resin. Preferably, the solvent contains 0 to 1 by weight of a polar solvent based upon the weight of the phenolic resin. Most preferably, the solvent is entirely free from polar solvents. The solvents employed preferably have flash points of at least 100 F 38 . The solvents employed are aromatic hydrocarbon solvents with or without the addition of aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents and containing at least 80 percent by weight aromatics. Suitable aromatic solvents are naphthalenes, alkyl substituted naphthalenes, alkyl substituted benzenes, and mixtures thereof. The most preferred aromatic solvents are mixed solvents that have an aromatic content of at least 85 percent and a boiling point range of 280 F 138 C to 450 F 232 C . Suitable aliphatic solvents are kerosene, mineral spirits, 140 solvent from Ashland, and, low odor base solvents from Ashland. Accordingly, the present invention makes it possible to exclude the more expensive polar solvents without a concomitant loss in the required compatibility. The second component, or package, of the binder composition comprises an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic polyisocyanate having preferably from 2 to 5 isocyanate groups. If desired, mixtures of organic polyisocyanates can be employed. Suitable polyisocyanates include the aliphatic polyisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, alicyclic polyisocyanates such as 4,4 dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate, and the dimethyl derivatives thereof. Further examples of suitable polyisocyanates are 1,5 naphthalene diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, and the methyl derivatives thereof, polymethylenepolyphenyl isocyanates, chlorophenylene 2,4 diisocyanate, and the like. Mixtures of isocyanates can be used. Although all polyisocyanates react with the phenolic resin to form a cross linked polymer structure, the preferred polysiocyanates are aromatic polyisocyanates and particularly polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanates such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate. The polyisocyanate is employed in sufficient concentrations to cause the curing of the phenolic resin. In general, the polyisocyanate will be employed in a range of 10 to 500 weight percent of polyisocyanate based on the weight of the phenolic resin. Preferably, from 20 to 300 weight percent of polyisocyanate on the same basis is employed. The polyisocyanate is employed in liquid form. Liquid polyisocyanates can be employed in undiluted form. Solid or viscous polyisocyanates are employed in the form of organic solvent solutions, the solvent being present in a range of up to 80 percent by weight of the solution. Most preferably, the isocyanate is employed in a stoichiometric amount about 20 percent based on the available hydroxyl groups of the phenolic resin. The solvent employed for the polyisocyanate is at least 50 percent by weight aromatic and also substantially free from polar solvents. Mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic solvents are usually employed. The binder compositions are preferably to be made available as a two package system with the solution of the phenolic resin in one package and the isocyanate components in the other package. The binder components can be combined and then admixed with sand or a similar aggregate to form the molding mix or the mix can also be formed by sequentially admixing the components with the aggregate. Methods of distributing the binder on the aggregate particles are well known to those skilled in the art. The mix can, optionally, contain other ingredients such as iron oxide, ground flax fibers, wood cereals, pitch, refractory flours, and the like. When preparing an ordinary sand type foundry shape, the aggregate employed has a particle size large enough to provide sufficient porosity in the foundry shape to permit escape of volatiles from the shape during the casting operation. The term ordinary sand type foundry shapes , as used herein, refers to foundry shapes which have sufficient porosity to permit escape of volatiles from it during the casting operation. Generally, at least 80 percent and preferably 90 percent by weight of aggregate employed for foundry shapes has an average particle size no larger than 50 mesh Tyler Screen Mesh 290 µm . The aggregate for foundry shapes preferably has an average particle size between 50 and 150 mesh Tyler Screen Mesh 290 and 105 µm The preferred aggregate employed for ordinary foundry shapes is sand wherein at least 70 weight percent and preferably at least 85 weight percent of the sand is silica. Other suitable aggregate materials include zircon, olivine, aluminosilicate sand, chromite sand and the like. When preparing a shape for precision casting, the predominant portion and generally at least 80 percent of the aggregate has an average particle size no larger than 150 mesh Tyler Screen Mesh 105 µm and preferably between 325 mesh and 200 mesh Tyler Screen Mesh 44 µm and 74 µm . Preferably, at least 90 percent by weight of the aggregates for precision casting applications are fused quartz, zircon sands, magnesium silicate sands such as olivine, and aluminosilicate sands. When preparing a refractory such as a ceramic, the predominant portion and at least 80 weight percent of the aggregate employed has an average particle size under 200 mesh 74 µm and preferably larger than 325 mesh 44 µm . Preferably, at least 90 percent by weight of the aggregate for a refractory has an average particle size under 200 mesh 74 µm and preferably larger than 325 mesh 44 µm . The aggregate employed in the preparation of refractories must be capable of withstanding the curing temperatures such as above 1500 F 816 C which are needed to cause sintering for utilization. Examples of some suitable aggregates employed for preparing refractories include the ceramics such as refractory oxides, carbides, nitrides, and silicides such as aluminum oxide, lead oxide, chromic oxide, zirconium oxide, silica, silicon carbide, titanium nitride, boron nitride, molybdenum disilicide, and carbonaceous material such as graphite. Mixtures of the aggregate can also be used, when desired, including mixtures of metals and the ceramics. Examples of some abrasive grains for preparing abrasive articles include aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, boron carbide, corundum, garnet, emery and mixtures thereof. The grit size is of the usual grades as graded by the United States Bureau of Standards. These abrasive materials and their uses for particular jobs are understood by persons skilled in the art and are not altered in the abrasive articles contemplated by the present invention. In addition, inorganic filler can be employed along with the abrasive grit in preparing abrasive articles. It is preferred that at least 85 percent of the inorganic filler has an average particle size no greater than 200 mesh 74 µm . It is most preferred that at least 95 percent of the inorganic filler has an average particle size no greater than 200 mesh 74 µm . Some inorganic fillers include cryolite, fluorospar, silica, and the like. When an inorganic filler is employed, along with the abrasive grit, it is generally present in amounts from 1 to 30 percent by weight based upon the combined weight of the abrasive grit and inorganic filler. Although the aggregate employed is preferably dry, it can contain small amounts of moisture, such as up to 1 percent by weight or even higher based on the weight of the aggregate. In molding compositions, the aggregate constitutes the major constituent and the binder constitutes a relatively minor amount. In ordinary sand type foundry applications, the amount of binder is generally no greater than 10 percent by weight and frequently within the range of 0.5 to 7 percent by weight based upon the weight of the aggregate. Most often, the binder content ranges from 0.6 to 5 percent by weight based upon the weight of the aggregate in ordinary sand type foundry shapes. In molds and cores for precision casting applications, the amount of binder is no greater than 40 percent by weight and frequently within the range of 5 to 20 percent by weight based upon the weight of the aggregate. In refractories, the amount of binder is no greater than 40 percent by weight and frequently within the range of 5 percent to 20 percent by weight based upon the weight of the aggregate. In abrasive articles, the amount of binder is generally no greater than 25 percent by weight and frequently within the range of 5 percent to 15 percent by weight based upon the weight of the abrasive material or grit. Although the aggregate employed is preferably dry, moisture of up to 1 weight percent based on the weight of the aggregate can be tolerated. This is particularly true if the solvent employed is non water miscible or if an excess of the polyisocyanate necessary for curing is employed since such excess polyisocyanate will react with the water. The molding is molded into the desired shape, whereupon it can be cured so as to retain this shape upon removal from the mold. Curing can be effected by passing a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or dimethylethyl amine, through the molded mix as described in US A 3,409,579. A valuable additive to the binder compositions of the present invention in certain types of sand is a silane such as those having the general formula wherein R is a hydrocarbon radical and preferably an alkyl radical of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R is an alkyl radical, an alkoxy substituted alkyl radical, or an alkyl amine substituted alkyl radical in which the alkyl groups have from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The aforesaid silane, when employed in concentrations of 0.1 to 2 percent by weight based on the weight of the phenolic binder and hardener, improves the humidity resistance of the systems. Examples of some commercially available silanes are Dow Corning Z6040 and Union Carbide A 187 gamma glycidoxy propyltrimethoxy silane Union Carbide A 1100 gamma aminopropyltriethoxy silane Union Carbide A 1120 N beta aminoethyl gamma amino propyltrimethoxy silane and Union Carbide A 1160 Ureido silane . Other valuable additives include wetting agents bench life additives and internal release agents such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols and or derivatives of these materials, and silicone materials such as dimethyl , methylphenyl , and diphenylpolysiloxanes. A suitable fatty acid is sylfat 96 from Sylvachem Corp. which is based on oleic and linoeic acids. In order to further understand the present invention, the following non limiting examples concerned with foundry shapes are provided. All parts are by weight, unless the contrary is stated. In all examples, the tensile strength samples are cured by the so called cold box process by contacting with dimethylethylamine.
