# Legibility enhancement for a data display.

## Abstract
By switching a character generator between two dif ferent dot patterns or fonts for each character in response to the state of a normal reverse mode control the legibility of reverse video fonts is increased. In the reverse font 32 , each vertical stroke has two or more consecutive dots in the vertical strokes wherever the normal font 31 has a single dot.
