# THERMOSENSITIVE RECORDING MATERIAL

## Abstract
Thermosensitive recording material T comprising a support 1 , a polyolefin resin layer 2 and a thermosensitive recording or coloring layer 3 , both formed on one side of the support in that order. The thermosensitive coloring layer is made of a dispersion, in a binder, of a colorless or pale colored leuco dye and an acidic material capable of color formation of the leuco dye when it is heated. When a pressure sensitive adhesive layer 5 and a release paper 6 are formed on the other side of the support in that order, the thermosensitive recording material can be used as a thermo sensitive recording label.
