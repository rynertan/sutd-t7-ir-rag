# FLUORESCENT DISCHARGE LAMP.

## Abstract
A fluorescent discharge lamp with greater lumines cence. In the lamp, plural fluorescent material layers 3 , 4 are laminated on the base body of a glass tube 1 and the density of activating material in the fluorescent material layer 3 , the one layer nearer to the glass base body, is set to be less than that of the activator material in the fluorescent material layer 4 , the other layer further from the glass base body, so that a fluorescent layer with a lower ultraviolet ray reflection factor is formed on the discharge side and a fluorescent layer with improved quantum efficiency and a higher ultraviolet ray reflection factor on the glass base body side. Thus, the emitted ultraviolet rays are absorbed into the fluorescent layers to a greater degree than in the conventional lamp, thus increasing luminescence. The lamp is used in the illumination field or the like.
