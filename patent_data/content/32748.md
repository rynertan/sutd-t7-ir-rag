The carrier material, used for the uniform distribution of the present compounds in effective amounts, may be either a liquid or particulate solid material, and is not limited to specific materials. Suitably usable solid carrier materials include, for example, various kinds of kaolin, clay, diatomaceous earth, talc, silica and the like.Suitably usable liquid carrier materials may be those which are inert solvents for the present active ingredient compounds and those which are non solvents therefor but capable of dispersing or dissolving said active ingredient compounds by the aid of appropriate adjuvants used in combination therewith. Such liquid carrier materials include, for example, benzene, xylene, toluene, kerosene, alcohols, ketones, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide and the like. By using such liquid carriers in admixture with appropriate surface active agents and other formulation aids, for example, spreading agents, sticking agents and the like, the present active ingredient compounds can be formulated into, and used as, aqueous solution or emulsions. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be used in admixture with other fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, etc.for the purpose of lessening the labor and of ensuring the controlling effect of the present compounds. When operating in accordance with the present invention, effective amounts of the compounds or compositions of this invention are applied to the plants in any convenient fashion. The application of liquid and particulate solid compositions to plants can be carried out by conventional methods, e.g., power dusters, boom and hand sprayers and spray dusters. The compositions can also be applied from airplanes as a dust or a spray because of their effectiveness at low dosages. The application of an effective amount of the compounds or compositions of this invention to the plant is essential for the practice of the present invention.The exact amount of active ingredient to be employed may vary depending on several factors including the response desired as well as the plant species to be treated and stage of development thereof, and the amount of rainfall as well as the specific type of compound used. Generally, however, the active ingredients are applied in amounts of from about 100 grams to about 1,000 grams per hectare.

After evaporating the acetone while removing the upper cover of the Shale overnight, the compound containing agar plate medium is inoculated by means of platinum loop with a spore suspension of the test fungus previously cultured in a slant medium. After culturing at 240C. for 48 hours, the growth of the test fungus was investigated according to the following standard for determining the growth of fungus.The results obtained are as shown in Tables 12a and 12b. Standard for determining the growth of fungus No growth of the fungus is recognized at all. Formation of only few colonies is observed at the portion where the spore suspension has been applied to, while the growth of the fungus is markedly prohibited. Formation of many colonies is observed at the portion where the spore suspension has been applied to, but the whole surface of the applied portion is not covered yet by colonies, and the growth of the fungus is markedly prohibited. The growth of the fungus is observed practically all over the surface of the applied portion, but the degree of the growth of the fungus is moderately poor. The growth of the fungus is observed all over the surface of the applied portion, and the fungus normally grows. Table 12aCompound Cono.
