## Abstract
A banked control store for conditional branching comprises an address multiplexer 22 for receiving original instructions, branch instructions, and increment instructions for controlling the selection of an output of said address multiplexer a control store address re gister 24 receiving the output of the address multi plexer a single microinstruction memory 92 for receiv ing the output from the control store address register and for producing a memory output a multiple micro instruction memory 96 for receiving the output from the control store address register a memory select network 94 for receiving the output of the single micro instruction memory and said multiple microinstruction memory and having an output consisting of a selected memory output an output register 36 for said memory select network a single microinstruction flip flop 26 for controlling the memory select network, the single microinstruction flip flop receiving an output from the address multiplexer 22 a branch logic network 54 for producing a control output which is provided to the address multiplexer and microcode branch condition re gister 56 for providing branch condition inputs to branch logic network.
