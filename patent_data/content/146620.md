## Description
Interpolymers of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, are well known. This present disclosure pertains to such interpolymers when made under steady state conditions in stirred reactors at high pressure and elevated temperature and using a free radical type initiator, in contradistinction to polymers made under non steady state conditions or in non stirred tubular reactors or in batch reactions, and in contradistinction to block copolymers or graft copolymers. Patents which disclose interpolymerizations of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids in a steady state reaction at high temperature and high pressure in a stirred reactor in the presence of a free radical initiator are, e.g., Canadian Patent 655,298 and its U.S. counterpart No. 4,351,931 U.S. 3,239,370 U.S. 3,520,861 U.S. 3,658,741 U.S. 3,884,857 U.S. 3,988,509 U.S. 4, 248,990 and U.S. 4,252,924. U.S. 3,239,370 discloses a random copolymerization of ethylene with an unsaturated carboxylic acid e.g. acrylic acid in a stirred autoclave operated at 112.5 M Pa 16000 psi , and 210 C using a peroxy initiator, the so formed copolymer being particularly useful as a coating for non metallic substrates. U.S. 3,520,861 discloses a substantially homogeneous, compositionally uniform, random copolymer of ethylene unsaturated acid e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid prepared in a continuous manner in a stirred autoclave at high pressure and elevated temperature, using a free radical initiator such as a peroxide .

The pressure of the polymerization is disclosed as being in the range of at least 98.1 M Pa 1000 atmospheres , preferably between about 98.1 294.3 M Pa 1000 3000 atmospheres , esp. between 107.9 186.4 M Pa 1100 1900 atmospheres . Canadian Patent No. 655,298 and its U.S. counterpart U.S. 4,351,931 discloses homogeneous, compositionally uniform, random copolymers of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids e.g. acrylic acid wherein said copolymer comprises at least about 90 by weight of ethylene with a melt index of 0.01 to 30 g 10 minutes.

U.S. 3,658,741 discloses homogeneous copolymers of ethylene and unsaturated carboxylic acids and esters, prepared in the presence of a chain transfer agent, a free radical catalyst, a temperature between 100 C 300 C and pressure between 9.81 98.1 M Pa 100 and 1000 atmospheres , using turbulent agitation the reaction is said to take place in the vapor phase and prepares very low mol. wt. copolymers. U.S. 3,884,857 and U.S. 3,988,509 disclose the preparation of copolymers, such as ethylene acrylic acid copolymers in a continuous, high pressure, free radical polymerization process, at 100 250 C and 98.1 245.25 M Pa 1000 2500 atmospheres of pressure. U.S. 4,248,990 discloses copolymers, e.g. ethylene acrylic acid copolymers which are said to distinguish over the random copolymers of Canadian 655,298 and of U.S. 3,520,861 by virtue of being non random. This non randomness is said to be the result of operating the steady state, high pressure, stirred reactor at a pressure of from 0 to about 3.5 M Pa 500 psi above, and at temperature of from 0 15 C above, that needed to maintain a single phase reaction mixture at the given concentration of copolymer in the reaction mixture and at the given acid comonomer content of the copolymer. U.S. 4,252,924 discloses the preparation of non random copolymers, e.g. ethylene acrylic acid copolymers in at least two constant environment, stirred autoclaves in series, each using a single phase reaction mixture, but where each succeeding autoclave is maintained at a temperature of at least 30 C above that of the preceding autoclave. In the ordinary course of events, operators of processes are not inclined to employ more energy temperature and or pressure than is deemed necessary to obtain a given product, in the absence of any recognized benefit to be derived from such additional expense. We have now found that there are unexpected benefits to be derived from employing more energy temperature and pressure than is generally deemed to be sufficient in the production of interpolymers of ethylene. With reference to random interpolymers of ethylene and olefinically unsaturated organic comonomers prepared in a well stirred autoclave, in the presence of a free radical initiator, under substantially constant conditions of temperature and pressure and substantially steady state, continuous operation, it has now been found, surprisingly and unexpectedly, that substantial and useful improvements are found by maintaining the synthesis conditions of temperature and pressure elevated high enough above the phase boundary that exists between the two phase and single phase conditions, for a given comonomer concentration and polymer concentration in the polymerization mixture, to reach, and or surpass the respective molecular weight distribution MWD boundary, i.e., the synthesis conditions at which the ratio of the weight average mol. wt. number average mol. wt. is at its maximum. Figure 1 is presented as a visual aid for relating the present inventive concept. In Figure 1 it is shown that as the synthesis conditions are increased substantially beyond the conditions at which the phase boundary is exceeded and at which single phase operation is achieved, there is found an increase in the ratio of weight average molecular weight MW Whereas the present inventive concept is perceived as being broadly applicable to interpolymers of ethylene and olefinically unsaturated organic comonomers, where ethylene comprises the majority amount of the monomer mixture, it is especially applicable to acrylates, methacrylates, vinyl esters, and olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids as comonomers. It is most especially applicable, and preferably used, in preparing polymers of ethylene interpolymerized with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. The ensuing descriptions reflect this preference of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid as comonomers. This disclosure pertains to a process for preparing improved, homogeneous, random ethylene copolymers, especially to improved copolymers of ethylene and carboxylic acid comonomers. It is an objective of this invention to provide ethylene copolymers which are especially well suited for adhesive, coating and or packaging purposes and as extrusion resins. The objectives of the present invention are accomplished by preparing, especially, a copolymer of ethylene and 0.1 35 weight percent of an α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid e.g., acrylic acid and methacrylic acid having a melt index in the range of 0.01 to about 5000 g 10 min ASTM D1238E . By homogeneous, random , it is meant that substantially all of the copolymer molecules have substantially the same chemical composition although their molecular weight can vary, and that the copolymer has a ratio of weight percent adjacent acid to total weight percent carboxylic acid in the copolymer less than 0.44 as determined in accordance with U.S. 4,248,990 . The copolymers of the present invention combine toughness, flexibility and chemical resistance with outstanding transparency, increased heat seal strength, improved hot tack strength, excellent extrusion coating properties and reduced microgel levels. One of the surprising attributes of the copolymers of the present invention is the outstanding transparency obtained at relatively low comonomer concentrations i.e., 10 percent by wt. . At such low concentrations, the copolymers of the present invention exhibit transparency ordinarily achievable only at high acid concentrations or via the additional preparation step of acid salt neutralization, e.g. as described in U.S. 3,264,272, U.S. 4,248,990, and U.S. 4,351,931. Thus, these copolymers are extremely useful as high clarity blown films in such applications as flexible packaging where the additional advantages of exceptional draw down, handleability, adhesiveness and printability without corona or other forms of pretreatment as well as excellent processability are observed. The interpolymers of this invention can also be readily prepared with molecular weight distributions determined by gel permeation chromatography, which may require esterification pretreatment suitable for coating applications where improved draw rates, adhesion and heat seal strengths are observed. The previous ethylene carboxylic acid copolymers commonly known in the art normally exhibit poor blown film optical properties that preclude their widespread utilization in some packaging applications. Therefore, the known art of acid salt neutralization for the preparation of ionomers is sometimes employed to confer substantial transparency to the acid copolymer. However, ionomer preparation tends to compromise some of the bulk adhesiveness by neutralizing carboxyl or acid groups imparting the adhesion. Routinely, blown film converters, coaters and laminators must pretreat the ionomer product to regain adequate adhesion. Other disadvantages of the known route to transparent, adhesive film grade or coating grade products is the fact that the ionomer is rheologically harder to process on conventional polyethylene extrusion equipment i.e., ionomers draw high amperages and require additional extruder cooling and is detrimentally moisture sensitive. The lack of transparency exhibited by commercially known copolymers indicates that these products are characterized by comparatively broad molecular weight distributions and or inadequate homogeneity. Pieski and Sashihara U.S. Patent 4,248,990 teach copolymer homogeneity as an attribute of single phase synthesis. Therefore, to prepare the homogeneous but non random copolymers of U.S. 4,248,990, the position of the phase boundary i.e., the transition from two phase to single phase reaction conditions must be identified, and the reaction zone must be maintained in steady state at a reactor pressure of from 0 to about 3.5 M Pa 500 psi above, and at a reactor temperature of from 0 to about 15 C above, that transition point. The improved homogeneity of the single phase products described in U.S. 4,248,990 is evidenced by lower levels of micro gels or grain than comparable two phase products. However, these single phase products still possess a fair amount of grain due to their preparation at synthesis conditions in the close proximity of their respective phase boundaries. Such single phase products will also show broader molecular weight distributions than comparable two phase products with a subsequent decrease in transparency, and hence, require acid salt neutralization to achieve the transparency needed for a variety of packaging applications. The broad molecular weight distributions of these single phase products, which are not offset by improved homogeneity, also result in a decrease in the maximum draw rate for film, filament, or coatings as compared to comparable two phase products. At synthesis temperatures and pressures above the range specified by Pieski and Sashihara, the resultant single phase products are said to be random versus non random as indicated by lower ratios of percent adjacent acid to total weight percent carboxylic acid. Such single phase products like those prepared at synthesis conditions in the specified range directly above the phase boundary are assumed to possess increasingly broader molecular weight distributions as reactor temperature and pressures are progressively increased. With reference to Figure 1, which plots the MW In accordance with the present invention, homogeneous, random single phase ethylene copolymers with significantly improved transparency, heat seal strength and hot tack strength, and with molecular weight distributions similar to two phase products, are readily prepared well above the position of the phase boundary and above the range of non randomness disclosed in U.S. 4,248,990. Analogous to the phase boundary, we have found that there exists a transition boundary from broad molecular weight distributions to narrow molecular weight distributions. Unlike the phase boundary, the molecular weight distribution MWD boundary is not identified by the dramatic changes in initiator demand efficiency , or by the significant changes in reactor stirrer motor amperage that are well known to those skilled in the art. However, this position can be conveniently identified at a given comonomer concentration by observing the discontinuity in molecular weight distribution at a constant product melt index and comonomer concentration as synthesis conditions are changed in a manner to pass through the molecular weight distribution MWD boundary Figure 1 . Before reaching this molecular weight distribution MWD boundary, random single phase products exhibit broader molecular weight distributions than comparable two phase products and non random single phase products. However, as the MWD boundary is approached, the random single phase products will exhibit homogeneity that, surprisingly, offsets their broad molecular weight distributions and permits significantly improved transparency, heat seal strengths and drawdown rates. When synthesis conditions are increased further and or progressively above the MWD boundary, the respective molecular weight distribution correspondingly narrows, i.e., the ratio of MW where Although the exact position of a MWD boundary depends upon comonomer concentration and a number of other variables, tests as above will demonstrate that the position is well above the corresponding phase boundary for the given comonomer concentration. For example, the MWD boundary occurs 14 M Pa 2000 psi above, and 15 above, the phase boundary when producing an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer containing nine percent acrylic acid by weight. In addition to the ability to tailor the desired molecular weight distributions and achieve improved transparency and coating properties, in accordance with the present invention, single phase products prepared just below, at, or above the MWD boundary possess less microgels or grain than comparable two phase products as well as less grain than the non random, single phase products prepared e.g. in U.S. 4,248,990. In fact, at or above a corresponding MWD boundary, completely grain free products can be readily prepared. This reduction in microgels or grain has an aesthetic appeal, and the presence of excessive amounts of grain can contribute to inadequate heat seal and hot tack strengths, as well as promote delamination by compromising the adhesiveness. The improved heat seal and hot tack strengths of these single phase products is also an object of this invention. The copolymers of the present invention can be conveniently prepared at reactor pressures from about 126.5 to about 351.5 M Pa about 18,000 to about 50,000 psi and at reactor temperatures from about 150 to about 350 C so long as the phase boundary conditions are appreciably exceeded. The preferred reactor is a continuous autoclave with a 1 1 to about a 16 1 L D ratio. The reactor may consist of one or more reaction zone s by installing baffling systems common in the art the reactor may be in series with one or more other reactors and the reactor may also be provided with one or more comonomer entry point s as described by British Patent 1,096,945. Hence, when more than one reaction zone is employed, the reactor s can be maintained to provide an intrazone and or interzone constant environment or it is also possible to operate in such a manner that a gradient of environments exists between and or within the zones and or reactors. The products of this invention can be prepared with or without the use of solvents or hydrocarbons as telogens and or carriers for the comonomer s and or initiator s . These products are also useful as base resins for the preparation of ionic copolymers, known in the art as Ionomers , wherefrom additional improvements in transparency, chemical resistance and hot tack strength are readily obtained. The gels that often characterize ethylene carboxylic acid interpolymers can be of many different shapes, varying sizes and of more than one origin. For instance, microgels or grain i.e., very small and fine gels are shown in accordance with this disclosure to be an attribute of operating within and or in the close proximity of a respective phase boundary large gels i.e., gels 25µ in diameter are usually an attribute or the result of thermal oxidation degradation however, microgels or grain can actually seed these larger gels. In this disclosure, the following gel rating is used The following examples are to illustrate embodiments of the present invention, but the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated. A 38µm 1.5 mil blown film was prepared from an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer that contained 6.5 percent acrylic acid by weight and had a 2.5 g 10 min melt index ASTM D1238E . The copolymer was prepared about 0 3.5 M Pa about 0 500 psi above and about 0 15 C above its respective phase boundary and the film exhibited excessive microgels or grain , a Gardner clarity of 12 percent transmission, a 20 film gloss of 25 percent reflected light, a film haze of 5.5 percent scattered light, a heat seal strength, at a 154 C 310 F sealing bar temperature, of 0.57 kg cm 3.2 lbs in width and a hot tack strength, at a 149 C 300 F sealing bar temperature, of 59 g cm 150 grams inch . Conversely, a 6.5 percent acrylic acid by wt. copolymer having the same melt index was prepared about 24.5 to about 31.5 M Pa about 3500 to about 4500 psi above and about 16 to about 18 C above its corresponding phase boundary. The resultant blown film of this product had a Gardner clarity of 47 percent, a 20 gloss of 45 percent, a film haze of 3.2 percent, negligible microgels or grain , a 0.87 kg cm 4.9 lbs in heat seal strength at 154 C 310 F and a 78.7 g cm 200 g in in hot tack at 149 C 300 F . Both samples were fabricated into 38.1µm 1.5 mil film on an NRM 20 1, L D extruder that was equipped with an air ring, mandrel, annular die, and a take off unit. Both fabrications maintained 204 C melt temperature with a 2.25 1 blow up ratio. Data for the above examples and for additional samples of ethylene acrylic acid copolymers are shown in the following tables. Whereas Examples 1, 5, 8, 11 and 15 are examples of prior art used in making non random copolymers at 0 3.5 M Pa 0 500 psi above, and 0 15 C above, the phase boundary, the remaining examples illustrate various embodiments of the present invention, all of which were produced at a temperature above the phase boundary temperature.
