# A cooling system of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A steam from a water jacket 32 of the engine 30 is pressurized to form a pressurized steam. The steam thus pressurized is then cooled and condensed by air cooled condenser 44 to form a pressurized water. The pressurized water is then decompressed to have a normal pressure and then introduced into the water jacket for recirculation.
