## Description
Sectional conveyor chain for granulated and or powdered materials, particularly for foddersThe invention cnncerns a composable chain for conveyors of granular and or powdered materials, especially animal feed, that is to say a chain consisting of interchangeable filiform metallic elements of constant section and constant step interconnected among each other by spacial joints with forced insertion of each element into the adjacent one, The chain is pulled in a gliding way, with or without slack, at the inside of a straight or not straight tube, but in any case oriented in the space, The shape of the chain elements is suitable to provoke the entrainment of the material to be conveyed, when the chain is pulled at the inside of the conveyor tube the material to be can veyed may be at the state of middling, even ground or at the state of flour, moist or sticky or slippery.The prior state of art comprises tubular cylindric conveyors, at the inside of which the entrainment of the material to be conveyed is obtained by causing a metallic con tinuous cable or chain with not interchangeable links, equipped with a series of blind plastic disks, to slide at the inside of the conveyor tube these disks are arranged at constant step intervals in a plane that is perpendicular to the cable or to the link chain, The above said disks have a smaller diameter than that of the inside of the con veyor tube in order to avoid excessive flood of material in the single sections comprised between two of the above said disks, allowing part of it to pass between the periphe ral edge of the disks, and the inner surface of the tube and particularly above the upper sector of the disk edge, as the various disks lean on a small angular sector of the inner surface or wall of the tube due to gravity in the sec tions that are not vertical, In the above said conveyor ty pes frequently there are deposits formed in case of carrying moist or sticky materials, and these deposits may deter mine the irregular operation or also the stopping of the conveyor with, moreover, a possibility of breakage of the disks, which are fastened by means of hubs or shaped, du ring the construction phase, directly on the cable or on the pull chain. In case of breakage of the plastic disks, the cable, or the pull chain, it is necessary to extract the cable or the chain completely from the conveyor tube in order to repair it, which generally requires the inter vent ion of skilled technicians1This prior state of art is susceptible of further improve ments concerning the possibility of repairs without being compelled to extract the cable or the chain completely from the conveyor tube in case of their breakage concerning the possibility to avoid the forming of deposits at the inside of the tube of such a volume that they determine obstructions and resistance to movement, thus provoking damage of the plastic disks or even breakage of the cable or pull chain concerning the possibility to obtain an inexpensive, sturdy conveyor of simple construction, which may be used to convey granular, powdered, moist or dry, sticky or slippery materials even in tubes with large diameters for great rates of flow,From the aforesaid results the necessity of resolving the technical problem of finding an economical pulling device with a composable chain, the elements of which can easily and quickly be replaced on site, without any necessity of intervention of a skilled technician such a pulling devi ce having to be suitable to clean the inner surface of the tube from deposits this chain having to be composed of in terchangeable elements with spacial joints so that they can overcome bends of the tube even with a very small radius and up to a right angle moreover such a pullitig device has to be sturdy, light, movable in both directions, of simple and economical construction and suitable for use in conveyor tubes of large diameter for great rates of flow such as those used in factories and harbours for the quick load ing and unloading of great rates of flow of powdered materials in dry, moist, sticky or slippery state even over ver tical distancesThe invention resolves the above said technical problem by adopting a composable chain consisting of filiform metallic elements of constant section and constant step, interconnected among each other by spacial joints with forced insertion of each element into the adjacent one said filiform elements are formed by a longitudinal stem connected at one end by a component with one or more coils arranged in an inclined or perpendicular plane, compared to the stem, in such a way that they form the conveyor element of the material to be transported and or the scraper element of the inner tube surface it is foreseen that the conveyor element can be equipped with one circular coil only, at the inside of which a shutter diaphragm of plastic material is fixed in order to obtain a better entrainment of the material in case of conveyors for great rates of flow and with large diameter tubes. The connexion of the various chain e lements is obtained by equipping the elements with coupling devices to the two adjacent elements, the coupling being ma de by slightly forced or snapping insertion of one element into the other.These coupling devices limit the reciprocal movements in axial direction of the chain elements and guarantee a relative rotation in the space of one element compared to the other adjacent one over angles that can reach values of even 900 and, moreover, connect the single elements one with the other.In the following, three ways of carrying out the invention are described a first way, illustrated in Figures 1 to 9, in which the chain elements are equipped with coupling devices only at one end, whereas at the other end of the stem they are equipped with one or more coils of different shape, depending on whether the chain element has the function of conveying the material to be transported or of scraping the inner tube wall a second way, illustrated in Figures 10 to 13, in which the chain elements are equipped with simple and efficient coupling devices at both ends and, at one end, only with a flat component of coils, which are the same for all chain elements1 The third realization, illustrated in Figures 14 to 23 adopts a composable chain particularly suitable for conveyors with large diameter tubes for great rates of fow. The advantages obtained by this invention are great sim plicity of assembly and disassembly of the chain elements, especially with the second and third types of realization, which consent to make quick chain repairs on site without any need of intervention of skilled technicians regular operation of the conveyor without crawling, as the chain elements scrape off the possible deposits that have come into existence on the walls of the conveyor tubes during their movement estremely simple and sturdy construction, especially with reference to the second and, above all, to the third way of carrying out the invention possibility of using the chain in tubes arranged in any request ed way owing to the type of joint adopted between one chain element and the adjacent ones, especially in the second and third way of realization possibility of using the chain also for conveyors with large diameter tubes for great rates of flow, constructing the chain according to the third method of realization of the invention,The three ways of carrying out the invention are illustrat ed, just to give an example, in the eight enclosed design tables, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a chain

element having more than one coil in order to reduce the void front area, moreover, with progressive de crease of the diameter beginning from the outer circular coil and with re entrance of the final sector Figure 20 is the left hand view of Figure 19 Figure 21 is the longitudinal section of a length of chain with circular coil formed by a turn in one plane only, equipped with a plastic shutter diaphragm fixed at single points, particularly in order to obtain a vertical entrain ment without losses of the material conveyed within large diameter tubes, when it is necessary to avoid the use of metallic wire in order to keep the weight within certain limits Figure 22 is the section XXII XXII of Figure 21 Figure 23 is a detail of another plastic shutter diaphragm continuously fixed to the circular metallic coil1The items are indicated as follows 1 is the stem of a com posable chain element, consisting of preferably stainless metallic wire wound in helical cylindrical stiffening coils 2 and, consecutively, in helical coil 3 so as to form a truncated cone of entrainment of the type having a major base with a diameter inferior to that of the conveyor tube in order to convey the animal feed without clogging and without stopping 4 is an inverse and inclined bend length of the end of stem 1, immediately followed by an appendix 5 parallel to the stem itself, the end of which 6 can, if necessary, be bent sideways towards the outside like a catch after the insertion into the grommet 8, the opening of the latter being of lesser width than the stem 1 diameter 9 indicates one or more

such a way as to present a peripheral front scraper edge 12 suitable to scrape the inner tube wall,against which it is lightk8tpushed by effect of the elastic material the outer diameter of the last coil being such as to consent the edge 12 to remain elastically adherent to the inner wall of said tube the scraper element can be inserted, for istance, between every five, ten or twenty entraining elements 13 is the conveyor tube, in any case bent and oriented in the space 14 indicates some deposits, 15 so me conglomerates formed with the concurrence of moisture or fallen off the tube 16 indicates the granular and or powdered material to be transported all the composable elements have the same length 17 Figure 9 is the scrap ing coil of a scraper element, beveled in such a way that it presents along its whole outline a peripheral front and rear scraping edge 18 19 is a coil of a smaller diameter than that of coil 17, located behind the coil 17 in the sense of the movement and partially surmounting it the coil 19 serving as a reinforcement of coil 17 against possible relaxation due to the action of scraping the inner tubewall the coupling of one chain element to the previous one is obtained by introducing the end 4 through the central void of the coils, elastically approaching the catch to the stem 1 of the element in order to permit its passage through said void so that it will penetrate into the grommet 8 20 Figure 10 indicates an arch shae ed bend towards the rear of one end of the stem 1 of a chain element constructed according to the second way of carrying out the invention, so that it forms a crook surrounding the grommet 23 together with the following length 21, convergent towards the stem 1 and with the final length 22, divergent from said stem 24 indicates a neck at the entrance of the grommet 23 with a width slightly smaller than that of the stem 1 diameter in order to consent the snap coupling of the following chain elements 25 indicates the stem 1 end opposite from the hook, bent to U shape in the opposite sense and in a plane of 900 compared to the hook itself, forming the loop 26 27 is a spiral contained in an orthogonal plane compared to the stem and having its origin at the end 25 bent to U shape, the spi ral ending with a fraction of coil 28 deviated from the plane of the coils 27 towards the side opposite to that of the grommet 23 and bent with a minor radius up to a point, where its free end 29 re enters into the diameter of the outer circle of the spiral, practically coinciding with the inner one of tube 13, or slightly inferior to it in order to avoid that the end itself scores the inner surface of said tube 30 Figure 14 indicates a circular coil lying on a perpendicular plane compared to the axis of stem 1, forming a rear and side extension of theU shaped bending 31, lying on the same plane as the stem 1 by means of the connexion length 32 33 indicates the free end of the coil 30 spaced from the connexion length 32 in order to avoid the formation of deposits 34 is a spiral with major development of a turn, the final length 35 of which is bent towards the rear out of the plane con taining one or more turns of the spiral in order to superimpose itself to the rear of the coil with greater dia meter without projecting peripherally from it and cooperat ing to form a circular peripheral outline 36 indicates a connexion length between the U shaped bend 31 and the coil 30, followed by a length of re entering rear coil 37 and by a fraction of coil or a whole coil or more than one coil like 38 lying at the inside of the coil 30, in the same plane of it or in a plane comprised between the initial one of coil 37 and the plane of coil 30 39 Figure 21 is a concave plastic diaphragm equipped with projections 40 intended for fixing it to coil 30 peripherally equipped with semicylindrical housing springer for the snap coupling with the inner surface of the coil 30 41 Figure 23 is an other type of concave shutter plastic diaphragm snap coupled with the coil 30, equipped with a peripheral semi cylindrical continuous housing springer 42 with peripheral edges respectively 43 and 44 firming an anti extraction grip on the coil itself 45 indicates a centre line notch of U shape of the diaphragm 3 or 41 to consent the straddling insertion of the U shaped bend 31 and of the joint 32 In case of Figures 1 9 the operation is the following having pulled the stems 1 in the direction of the 3rrow Figures 7,8 , the coils 3 carry the greater part rf the material to be conveyed, whereas part of it escapes between the most exterior coil 3 and the wall of the ube 13 the peripheral edge 12 of the coil 10 of a scraper element glides with moderate elastic pressure on the inner wall of tube 13, thus eliminating the deposits 14 or preventing their forming the detached deposits and possible agglomerates of material 15 pass through the coil 10 without slow ing down the moving of the conveyor, even if they are big the grommet 8 of the inclined bend 4 of the front end of stem 1, put on the connexion length between the stem and the first coil 2, 9 determines the position of coupling and the step of the chain elements during the transport in direction of the arrow, the extraction being prevented by the side catch 6, which consents an axial play and also the angular oscillation in the space of a chain element compared to the adjacent ones up to the limit consented by the position of the above said catch end and by its shifting, which must consent the elastic insertion of the end itself through the central void of the coils 2,9 As to the element of Figures 10, 11, 12, 13, the operation of scraping the inner tube 13 surface is made by the periphe ry of the extreme outer coil 27, 28, the end of which 29 is hidden by the backside of a length of the preceding coil the snap coupling between two chain elements is brought about by forcing the U shaped bend 25 through the neck 24 of the crook 21, 22 in such a way that the archshaped bend of stem 1 of an element couples with the bend 25 of the other element in this situation the bend 25 is inserted with a clearance in the grommet 23 it is to be noted that the axial play between two consecutive chain elements in both senses is limited by the neck 24 at the opening of the grommet 23 and that the articulation angle in the space is only limited with equal rear projection of the U shaped bend 25 by the leaning of the last coil 28, against which stem 1 comes to rest in case of an elbow bending of the tube 13 the articulation angle can therefo re reach the value of 900. Finally, in case of Figures 16 to 23, there is a greater resistance and elasticity in lon gitudinal direction besides obtaining the scraping and cou pling conditions foreseen in the previous cases, because of the effect of the coplanarity of the crook 20, 21 22 with the U shaped bend 31, thus obtaining the possibility of overcoming possible crawling with damage and without intervention of the calibrated safety device, which in terrufa s the chain pull as soon as the extension exceeds a pre established value moreover, the adoption of a cir cular coil 30 in one turn only with connexion 32 in the plane of the U shaped bending 31 consents to introduce in to its inside an extractable concave shutter diaphragm 39, 41 with U shaped notch to improve the entrainment of the material without increasing the use of heavy metallic wi re to fill the inner area of said coil, the effect of the concave shutter diaphragm being such as to cooperate in the entrainment of the material, limiting also its peripheral scattering it is to be noted that the peripheral edges of the diaphragm are reinforced, on the motion side, in order to permit its stable rotation, when its bottom bends because of the resistance of the materialIn the practical realization the material, the dimensions, and the execution details can be different from those indicated, but should be technically equivalent, without leaving thejuridical dominionof this invention
