## Description
The present invention relates to cosmetic compositions, containing glycerin, which are useful for imparting moisture to the skin of humans. Hitherto, glycerin has been suggested for use in the treatment of dry skin conditions but one disadvantage of any composition which contains a high concentration of glycerin is that it leaves a wet and coated feeling on the skin which is cosmeticallyunacceptable to the user. U.K. Patent Application GB A 1,575,201 which is equivalent to DE A 2,601,049 and US A 3,932,614 discloses a cosmetic preparation comprising water, carboxypolymethylene and 1 to 50 by weight of a lubricating agent selected from the group consisting of chlorotrifluoroethylene resin, the homopolymer of tetrafluoroethylene, the homopolymer of hexafluoropropylene, and the copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene having the formula CF₂CF₂ CF₂CFCF₃ n where n is an integer corresponding to the number of repeating units in the copolymerized chain. It has now been found that the above disadvantage can be overcome or reduced by including polymer particles in a cosmetic composition containing high levels of glycerin. At the same time, the skin moisturising properties of glycerin can be efficiently utilised. According to the present invention, there is provided a cosmetic composition for moisturising skin, comprising from 10 to 30 , by weight of the composition, of glycerin, from 0.2 to 5 , by weight of the composition, of particulate polymer or copolymer which is capable of reducing the lubricity of glycerin, and a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the amount of glycerin is from 15 to 30 . Other suitable amounts of glycerin are from 10 to 20 , or 20 to 30 . The preferred amount of polymer or copolymer is from 0.2 to 2 , particularly preferably about 0.5 . The polymer or copolymer in the composition of the invention should be capable of reducing the lubricity of the glycerin so that the composition has a non oily, non wet feel on the users skin. Polymers which are particularly useful in the composition according to the invention are acrylic copolymers such as those described in United States Patent Nos. 4,043,952 and 4,090,013, and starch graft copolymers such as those described in US Patent Nos. 3,935,099, 3,981,100, 3,985,616, 4,069,177, 4,045,387, 4,116,899, 4,134,863 and 4,194,998. The composition of the invention preferably contains from about 0.5 to about 1 of acrylic or starch graft copolymer, particularly preferably about 0.5 . Other useful polymers are polyethylenemicrospheres, such as Polymist B 6 The polymer or copolymer is in the form of particles having an average particle size in the range of 5 to 15µm microns , preferably 5 to 7µm microns . In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of imparting moisture to skin which comprises applying to skin an effective amount of a composition of the invention. The composition of the invention may include any of the ingredients customarily used in cosmetic formulations intended for application to skin. Typical ingredients are preservatives, perfumes, colouring agents and anti oxidants. The cosmetically acceptable carrier may comprise conventional materials such as oil in water or water in oil emulsions. The composition of the invention may be prepared by admixture. Accordingly, the invention also provides a process for preparing the cosmetic composition of the invention, which comprises admixing the components of the composition in the required proportions. The admixing should be carried out so that the polymer or copolymer is uniformly dispersed throughout the final composition. The oil in water or water in oil emulsion may be prepared according to general methods described in UK Patent Specification Nos. 1 489 133 and 2 026 319. The emulsion may then be mixed with the glycerine and copolymer or polymer to produce the final composition of the invention. The invention is now illustrated by means of the following examples. The following moisturizing composition was prepared Permasorb 10 Acrylic copolymer National Starch and Chemical Co. The following moisturizing composition was prepared Permasorb 10 Acrylic copolymer The following moisturizing composition was prepared Permasorb 10 Acrylic copolymer The following moisturizing composition was prepared Permasorb 10 Acrylic copolymer The following moisturizing composition was prepared Permasorb 10 Acrylic copolymer The following moisturizing composition was prepared Permasorb 10 Acrylic copolymer The following moisturizing composition was prepared The following moisturizing composition was prepared The following moisturizing composition was prepared The following moisturizing composition was prepared The following moisturizing composition was prepared Similar compositions to those of Examples 8 to 11 were prepared in which the Polymist B 6 was replaced by the same percentage by weight of Orgasol 2002D.
