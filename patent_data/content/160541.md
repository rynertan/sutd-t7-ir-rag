# Pneumatic tires.

## Abstract
A pneumatic tire having improved wet performance comprises a tread 1 of a rib type pattern divided into three or more ribs 2 by at least two circumferential grooves 5 so that the tread defines both side regions Ssh and the remaining central region Sc by a pair of the circumferential grooves arranged close to both side ends of the tread and is provided at each region with sipes 3, 4 . In this type of tire, each of the sipes 3 arranged in both side regions is inclined at a small angle with respect to the latitudinal line e of the tire and each of the sipes 4 arranged in the remaining central region is inclined at a small angle with respect to the longitudinal line m of the tire.
