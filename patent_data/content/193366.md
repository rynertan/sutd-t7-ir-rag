# Power booster switching at zero current.

## Abstract
A power booster module is described for use in a zero current switching converter array which includes a signal pulse train generator external to the power booster module, the pulse train having a frequency corresponding to the frequency of energy transfer cycles occurring in the array. The power booster module includes a zero current switching converter and a control input port to which the pulse train is applied to trigger energy transfer cycles in the booster module at the frequency of the pulse train, whereby the booster module operates coherently with the array to provide a share of the power drawn by a load.
