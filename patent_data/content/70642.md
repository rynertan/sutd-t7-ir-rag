## Description
A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING TANTALUM PENTOXIDEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing tantalum pentoxide. More specifically, it relates to a method and apparatus for manufacturing tantalum pentoxide Ta,O, from tantalum hydroxide Ta OH containing hydrofluoric compounds.EMI1.1 llhere Ms been increasing demands tor single crystalline litnium tantalate of high purity for use in producing, for example, surface acoustic wave filters. Since naturally occurring tantalate salts are of limited quantity and, in any event, expensive to obtain, the prior art has recovered the Ta205 from scrap products containing tantalum. These scraps could consist of scraps of tantalum products or scraps produced during the production of tantalum products. In the prior art, Ta2O5 is produced or recovered, for example, by the following process. A Ta source such as tantalate salts or a scrap product containing tantalum is dissolved in a solution of hydrofluoric acid. Sulphuric acid and methyl isobutyl ketone MIBK are added to the solution, and Ta is, thereby, extracted. Impurities in the Ta source such as, for example, niobium, silicon, iron, aluminum, calcium, etc. are extracted together with the extracted Ta, and are then removed by a reverse extraction method, using sulphuric acid and hydrofluoric acid.Next, a potassium salt, such as potassium carbonate, is added to the extraetion acid causing the Ta to be deposited in the form of potassium tantalum fluoride K2TaF7. The deposit is then filtered and is dissolved again in warm water at approximately 800 C . The dissolved solution is then hydrolized by the addition of aqueous ammonia, and a precipitate of tantalum hyroxide is obtained. After filtering the tantalum hydroxide, it is heated at approximately 9000C to give Tea205. In this method of manufacture, however, a residue of hydrofluoric acid used for dissolving the Ta source remains in the Ta OH s, and is not removed by the additional processing discussed above. As a result, the fluorine in the hydrofluoric acid reacts with the tantalum to produce tantalum fluoride Taxs, thus reducing the purity of the Ta205 obtained. This impurity adversely affects the growth of single crystalline lithium tantalate.Additionally, since the boiling point of TaF5 is low 229.5 C , it volatilizes and escapes during heating so that there is a progressive loss of Ta, resulting in lower yield.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention seeks to provide a method for producing Ta205 from Ta OH s containing fluorine compounds such as hydrofluoric acid with high yield and high purity. The invention also seeks to provide an apparatus for producing Ta205 of high purity from Ta OH s containing fluorine compounds such as hydrofluoric acid. According to the invention, powdered Ta OH s containing fluorine compounds is heated to a temperature sufficient to form Ta205 approximately 9O00C in accordance with the following formula EMI2.1 As previously discussed, TaFs is produced by the residual fluorine compounds.According to the invention, this TaFs is converted into T205. Additional steam is introduced into the reaction system to hydrolyze the TaFs into Ta2 O5 and hydrofluoric acid HF in accordance with the following formula EMI2.2 In this way TÃ¡ OH s containing fluorine compounds is changed into Ta20s by simultaneous dehydration and defluorination. The method mentioned above effectively reduces the amount of TaF5 contained in the produced Tea205 thereby increasing purity and yeild. According to another embodiment of the invention, an apparatus for manufacturing Ta205 from Ta OH 5 containing fluorine compounds is prdvided. The apparatus comprises, in the preferred form, a reactor having a reaction chamber or zone to receive the Ta OH 5 powder, a heating means for heating the reaction zone, an exhausting means for separating the gaseous reaction products and unreacted steam from the reaction zone and a steam supplying means for supplying steam into the i. cacti on zone.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In Fig. 1, a reactor 12 made of refractory material is provided. Reactor 12 has a reaction chamber 14 in which powdered Ta OH 5 16 is introduced and placed on a base member 20 within the chamber. Reaction chamber 14 is provided with a heating means 22 positioned along the side walls 24 of the reactor. Chamber 14 also includes a cover 26 which closes the chamber during the reaction process. An exhaust outlet 28 in the side wall of the chamber is used to completely separate the gaseous reaction products and unreacted steam from the tantalum pentoxide product. Exhaust gases, such as hydrofluoric acid, generated steam and unreacted steam in the chamber is removed through exhaust outlet 28. Steam from a steam generator 32 is introduced into chamber 14 through a steam supply pipe 30.Steam generator 32 comprises a water container 34, a boiling heater 36, an air pump 38 and air supply t19L pipe 40 Water 42 within water container 34 is boiled by g boiling heater 36. Air is supplied by air pump 38 through air supply pipe 40 into boiling water 42 so that steam is easily generated. The generated steam is supplied into reaction chamber or zone 14 through steam supply pipe 30. Air pump 38 and the temperature of heater 36 controls the flow rate of the steam supplied to the reaction zone. A more detailed explanation regarding the structure of reactor 12 is made with reference to Fig. 2. Reactor 12 is constructed of refractory material and has a cubelike form. The outer dimensions of reactor 12 aue w approximately 1 m x 1 m x 1 m having a wall thickness of approximately 10 cm. Heating means 22 comprises spaced heating rods 44 made of, for example, silicon carbonate and embeded within the walls 24 of chamber 14. The ends of each heating rod 44 extends, to the outside of the reactor through the walls of reaction chamber 14. Electric current from a power source not shown is supplied to each end of heating rods 44 for heating the interior of the reaction chamber.The power consumption of the entire heating rod assembly is approximately 52 kW h. Several vessels 18 containing Ta OH 5 powder 16 are placed on base member 20 at the bottom of the reaction chamber or zone. Steam supply pipe 30 entering reaction chamber 14 br off into three spray pipes 46, 48, 50. Each of the spray pipes 46, 48 and 50 has small holes 52 along its length for spraying out steam supplied by pipe 30. Steam supplied by pipe 30 is sprayed on the Ta OH powder through 5 holes 52. An inner cover 54 is provided over the spray pipe, as shown in Fig. 1, for preventing dispersion of the steam. When operating the apparatus, the temperature inside the reaction chamber 14 should normally be kept at about 8000 C or higher. The amount of steam needed will depend upon the amount of Ta OH 5 that has been placed in the reaction zone. It is preferred that the tantalam hydroxide be heated for at least about half an hour and the steam introduced at a flow rate of at least 2 liters minute per kg of tantalum hydroxide. It is also preferred that the steam be introduced at a tempeSure from about 70 1000 C. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the amount of steam liters min and the amount of F PPM contained in Tea 205 for various amounts of Ta OH 5 powder kg used as a starter. The data shown in Fig 3 was obtained by adding Ta OH 5 powder containing about 5,000 ppm of F to the reaction zone, the temperature of the steam was maintained between 70 100 C, and the reaction chamber, having a volume of 120 liters, was maintained at about 9000C for approximately 2 hours. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the amount ofF contained in the Ta205 product is substantially reduced by introducing steam, and the amount of the steam required depends upon the amount of the Ta OH 5 powder charged. The larger the amount of Ta OH 5 powder charged, the longer the required flow rate of steam.For example, if it is required to obtain Ta205 containing below 50 ppm ofF, at least 20 liters minute of steam should be supplied for 10 kg ofTa OH 5 powder, while at least 80 liters minute of steam should be supplied for 20 kg of Ta OH 5 powder. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between heating time H and theamount of F contained in the Ta205 for various amounts of Ta OH 5 powder kg . The data shown in Fig. 4 was obtained by adding Ta OH 5 powder containing about 5000 ppm of F to the reaction zone, the flow rate of steam was approximately 500 liters minute with a temperature of 70 100 C and the reaction chamber, having a volume of 120 liters, was maintained at about 9000 C. It is clear from Fig. 4 that about 0.5 hours of heating will reduce the amount of F contained in Ta205 below 100 ppm. According to a prior art comparison experiment using the apparatus mentioned above, substantialEMI5.1 in yield and purity were obtained. When 10 kg and 20 kg of Ta OH containing 4700 ppm and 5100 ppm of FEMI5.2 placed in the reaction zone, and steam was introduced for 2 hours at flow rates of 400 liters min and 600 liters min, respectively, quanttive analysis of the Ta2O5 powder obtained, by theAlfson absorptiometric method, showed the presence of fluorine in amounts below 10 ppm in each case. The amounts of fluorine in Ta205 obtained by conventional methods, however, were 360 ppm and 540 ppm, respectively. Although illustrative embodimentS of the invention have been described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For example, the electric heating means can be substituted by some other heating means such as steam heating or high irequency heating.
