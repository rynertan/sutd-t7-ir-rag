# Bis aminopyridinium salts and their use as phase transfer catalysts for aromatic ether imide preparation.

## Abstract
Novel bis aminopyridinium salts are useful as phase transfer catalysts in the preparation of aromatic ethers by the reaction of hydroxyaromatic compound alkali metal salts e.g., bisphenol A disodium salt with activated halo or nitro substituted aromatic coumpounds e.g., 4 Nitro N methyl phthalimide . The bis aminopyridinium salts may be pre pared by the reaction of aminopyridines with bis carbonium ion generating compounds such as dibromoalkanes.
