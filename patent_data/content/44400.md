# FET memory cell structure and process.

## Abstract
A dense, vertical MOSFET memory cell 12 has a high charge storage capacitance per unit area of substrate surface. The charge storage capacitor structure is formed within a well 25 etched in the silicon semiconductor substrate 11 by a combination of reactive ion etching and a self limiting wet etch.
