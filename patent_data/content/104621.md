# Adjustable anchor mounting device.

## Abstract
An adjustable anchor mounting device suitable for use in a vehicle seat belt. The device comprises a base 12 having a plurality of interlocking means 20 provided spacedly along the direction of displacement of an anchor 17 , a slide member 13 guided along the base and carrying the anchor thereon, a latch piece 14 supported on the slide member, biasing means 15 normally urging the latch piece so as to keep it in engagement with one of the interlocking means, and release means 16 adapted to make the latch piece disengaged from the one of the interlocking means so as to permit the adjustment of position of the anchor. The latch piece is preferably supported by at least two points on the slide member with the corresponding interlocking means interposed between the two points. The device permits a prompt, smooth and fail free adjustment of the position of the anchor, e.g., a deflector. The latch piece can be kept in engagement with the one of the interlocking means even if the vehicle is overturned.
