# Diverter valve.

## Abstract
Diverter valve, controlling the flow of viscous fluids through one or the other of a pair of filters and having no isolated flow areas subject to stagnation constructed of a slide plate 54 sandwiched between a manifold block 50 and a backing plate 52 . The slide plate defines a passageway which mates with ports provided in a sealing surface of the manifold block so that a continuous flow path is provided between inlet and outlet of the diverter valve. Sealing pressure is maintained between the slide plate and the manifold block by a plurality of tie bolts urg ing the slide plate into contact with the manifold block.
