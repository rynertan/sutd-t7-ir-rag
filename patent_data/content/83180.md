# Valved coupling for conduits.

## Abstract
A coupling for conduits through which passes a liquid that must be kept from spilling and or from being exposed to the air, comprises a pair of parallelepipedal blocks 1 , 3 in each of which is disposed a ball valve 31 . Two flat faces of the blocks mate, whereupon the blocks are releasably secured together by bolts 59 . The ball valves are disposed as close as possible to the mating interface of the blocks and the liquid passageway that opens through the mating faces is surrounded by an annular bevel 45 . Each ball valve has an operator 33 whose rotation through 90 between open and closed valve positions is predetermined by a pin 47 on the operator that engages one or the other face of a recess milled in the block. A pin 39 disposed in a hole 37 in the block is disposed in an annular groove in the valve operator to retain the operator in the block.
