# Optical disc players.

## Abstract
An optical disc player for reproducing an information signal from an optical disc on which the information signal is re corded in the form of pits arranged in a record track, comprises an optical arrangement 5 for directing a light beam onto the optical disc so as to be modulated by the record track and re flected therefrom, a photodetecting assembly 11, 12 for re ceiving reflected light beam from the optical disc to produce in response to the received light beam an output from which a re produced information signal can be obtained, and a control cir cuit portion including a tracking error signal producing circuit 20, 33, 41, 51 for generating a tracking error signal from the output of the photodetecting assembly 11, 12 when a beam spot formed by the light beam on the optical disc is positioned on a pit, and a focus error signal producing circuit 20, 34, 42, 52 for generating a focus error signal from the output of the photodetecting assembly 11, 12 when the beam spot formed by the light beam on the optical disc is positioned on a plane portion of the optical disc between pits.
