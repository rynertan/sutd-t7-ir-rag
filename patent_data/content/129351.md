# Pneumatic gun having improved firing valve.

## Abstract
A pneumatic gun having an improved firing valve 22 is disclosed wherein the firing valve 22 is sealingly secured to the housing 11 of the gun by a pair of rolling diaphragm seals 86, 89 . On the underside of the firing valve 22 , there is a deflector 85 having a downwardly curled outer edge opera tive to direct air flow into the top of the cylinder 21 upon opening of the firing valve 22 . The firing valve 22 is so configured that exposure of multiple differential areas of the valve to a common high pressure results in the valve 22 being biased toward a sealed position relative to the cylinder 21 of the gun while in the unfired position.
