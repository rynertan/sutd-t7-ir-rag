# Diagnostic test methods.

## Abstract
Agglutination assays, particularly latex agglutination assays, for simultaneous testing for a multiplicity of ligands. The reagents for use in the assays comprise two or more insoluble coloured substances, each substance being adapted to form a distinctively coloured agglutinate in the presence of a specific ligand or specific group of ligands.
