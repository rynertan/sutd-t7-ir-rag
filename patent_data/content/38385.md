## Abstract
By providing a molded or extruded plastic base cylinder or plate with a surface coating of an etchable metal, a low cost printing media is achieved for use in intaglio or gravure print ing. The plastic base cylinder may be machined to a low tolerance diameter before being substantially uniformly plated with an etchable metal such as copper or nickel about its entire outer peripheral surface, thereby assuring uniform balance and concentricity. The plated surface is then engraved or etched with the information to be printed, result ing in a low cost printing cylinder for use in intaglio or rotog ravure printing. In one embodiment, the cylinder incorporates a substantially uniform diameter shafting bore along its cen tral axis in order to provide for mounting the cylinder on a shaft or other fixture, while another embodiment provides for accurately disposed and engaging lugs which rotationally drive the cylinder. In this way, uniform pressure resistance and complete peripheral surface concentricity and balance is achieved during the printing, engraving, plating, and polish ing processes. Preferably, the plastic base comprises polyp ropylene, which may incorporate various fillers or resins for improving the plastic s physical characteristics.

## Description
METAL PLATED PLASTIC BASE IMAGLIO PRINTING CYLINDERSAND PLATES This invention relates to intaglio and gravure printing cylinders and plates, and more particularly to low cost, plastic based, metal surface cylinders and plates and the manufacture thereof. Generally, intaglio or rotogravure printing is obtained from cylinders mounted to rotate about their central axis with the outer peripheral surface of the cylinders having been etched with the particular information to be printed.The prior art cylinders generally comprise an outer peripheral layer of copper which when ground and polished to the exact desired diameter is then etched in order to carry the particular information to be printed. The prior art cylinders themselves generally comprise seamless tubing of steel or iron which has been cut to length and counterbored at its ends for the receipt of mounting gudgeons. The gudgeons are secured to the tubing in a variety of methods, such as welding, bolting, etc. with shafts extending from the center of the gudgeons in order to mount the resulting cylindrical,drum. The cylinder with the gudgeons and shaft is then mounted in a plating tank so that the entire outer peripheral surface of the cylinder is plated, Once the plating process is completed, the copper surface is polished until the exact diameter required in the printing machine is obtained Then, the image transfer ready cylinder is engraved or etched by one of a variety of well known methods, thereby embedding the desired information into the cylindrical surface. Finally, the cylinder is mounted in the rotogravure printing apparatus and printing is initiated. The rotogravure printing process has long been known as a process having low waste, flexibility and unexcelled quality in the resulting print. However, in spite of these inherent qualities in the rotogravure and intaglio printing methods, this process has only been employed generally for long run production, because of the extremely high cost for the production of cylindrical bases. One of the inherent features of the rotogravure printing process is its ability to print a complete 360 degrees while also being able to produce an infinitely variable repeat of information, within the capabilities of the machinery, onto a roll of paper without any mismatch or registry problem, since the cylinder can be etched about its entire periphery if so required by the design. As a result, the rotogravure printing process is presently employed in the production of wallpaper, wrapping paper, printed boxes, package wrappers, as well as catalogues and magazines as examples of publi cation and commercial printing applications , and other similar long run continuous patterned printed product lines where large rolls of paper or substrate can be continuously printed without interruption.Furthermore, it has only been economically feasible for such type of product lines to employ rotogravure printing since the high cost of tooling and setup can be amortized over the length of the run. Aside from the difficulty and the expense of setting up present rotogravure cylinders, the prior art cylinders suffer from the inherent difficu ty of having only firm contact with the rotation inducing shaft at the ends of the cylinder where the gudgeons are mounted. Since the information to be printed is engraved or etched in the cylinder s surface, tonal variations of the ink density can be achieved by varying the depth of the etch as well as the area of the etch. As a result, considerable pressure is exerted by the impression roller against the etched surface of the printing cylinder in order to force the paper passing between them down into the etched depressions in the cylinder s surface, thereby receiving these tonal variations. Due to this extreme pressure, the prior art cylinders have difficulty with the etched surface not coming into complete contact with the paper. This failure is generally due to internal bending of the cylinder against the pressure of the rollers or imperfect concentricity of the surface.As a result of the deflection and concentricity problems, any desired increasing of the effective length of a cylinder creates complex engineering problems. In some applications, solid steel drums have been employed to reduce the deflection problem, however such cylinders are obviously very expensive and extremely difficult to handle, as well as being very difficult to be made perfectly concentric to its central axis about the entire contact surface. Another problem inherently found in prior art rotogravure cylinders is the difficulty of maintaining a high degree of balance throughout the cylinder as the cylinder rapidly rotates. The typical construction of prior art cylinders with end mounted gudgeons driving either a tubular structured cylinder or a solid, heavy metal mass, creates an intrinsically unbalanced cylinder. Since one major advantage of rotogravure printing is its high speed, any detectable cylinder unbalance, no matter how slight, will create an increasing problem, first with tonal variations and eventually with system breakdown. Although prior art cylinders have been constructed with increasing tolerance levels being maintained, the basic structure of these prior art units prevents complete elimination of balance problems. In the first class of prior art cylinders, a solid heavy mass of metal is employed as the base. In this construction, balance can be minimized by extremely expensive machining procedures. However, since completely perfect balance is not economically feasible, the balance imperfections, however minor initially, become increasingly pronounced due to the unequal centrifugal pull exerted by this massive, heavy structure. The other general class of prior art cylinders is tubular structured.These cylinders are inherently unbalanced, since insufficient internal rigidity is employed or gudgeon like driving systems are used which are incapable of commercially feasible perfect balance. The best known prior art are the following references. However, these references are not believed to in any way teach or suggest the present invention. Ballard U.S. Patent 1,643,046 Koch French Patent 1,289,119 Hunn U.S. Patent 2,872,349 Trzyna U.S. Patent 3,693,544 Barker U.S. Patent 3,832,948 Ballard.discloses the typical prior art rotogravure cylinders which employ solid metal cylindrical bases, or thick walled metal cylindrical shells, with the etchable metal affixed thereto. In Koch, merely a plastic gravure plate and method of manufacturing thereof is disclosed. Koch shows in Figure 4, a hollow, cylindrically shaped multi layered plastic construction, however, there is absolutely no teaching or suggestion as to the construction of the supportive base on which this hollow, cylindrical shell will be mounted and driven. Furthermore, the disclosure relating to Figure 4 clearly shows that element 17 is an elongated electric lamp which extends along the axis of the hollow cylinder and is used to expose the gelatin layers forming the plate construction, in order to develop the layers in accordance with the disclosed process. There is no teaching or suggestion of any kind in Koch which in any way teaches a complete operative rotogravure printing cylinder or image ready cylinder. Similarly, both Trzyna and Hunn do not disclose an isotonic and isotropic plastic base construction which is capable of meeting the standards and criteria for an operative rotogravure printing cylinder. In Trzyna, the cylindrical core material was formed in place while Hunn discloses a carveable plastic cylinder for making a relief type surface.Neither disclosure is capable of teaching a cylindricallyshaped molded plastic supportive base capable of performing as a base of a rotogravure printing cylinder. In Barker, a flat plastic supporting base is taught which is directly etched in order to provide a printing master. This is completely divergent from the teaching of the present invention wherein plastic is employed as a supporting base only and is not directly etched. Furthermore, the plastic base of the present invention is surrounded with an etchable metal into which the printing information is etched. None of the best known prior art references in any way teaches or suggests a lightweight molded plastic supportive base for an operative gravure or intaglio printing system, as defined in the present application, with its isotonic, isotropic, stress and void free inherent characteristics as detailed in this present disclosure. These prior art references merely typify the problems, discussed in detail above, that have constantly faced the gravure printing field. and have heretofore gone unresolved. In the prior art gravure plates, the first generation or original plate is produced in a solid sheet of pure copper having a thickness ranging generally between 0.020 and 0.125 inches, and consequently, are heavy and expensive.Due to the high cost of investment required for a gravure plate to be etched or engraved, there is a complete lack in the industry of an image ready transfer gravure plate which could be maintained as a stock item ready for direct engraving and immediate use. Objects of the Invention Therefore, it is a principal object of this invention to provide gravure or intaglio printing cylinders and plates which are lightweight and inexpensive. Another object of this invention is to provide rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinders having the characteristic features defined above which are perfectly balanced and uniformly concentric. Another object of this invention is to provide rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinders having the characteristics defined above, which resist bending during the printing process at every point about the periphery of the cylinders. Another object of the invention is to provide rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinders having the characteristics defined above which are easily handled during assembly in the printing equipment. A further object of the invention is to provide rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinders having the characteristics defined above which can be manufactured in any desired length and can accommodate any diameter rotation inducing shaft. Another object of this invention is to provide gravure or intaglio printing cylinders having the characteristic.features defined above which accommodate end mounted driving means which eliminates the use of gudgeons. Another object of this invention is to provide gravure or intaglio printing plates which can be maintained as a stock item ready for direct engraving or etching and immediate use when required. Other and more specific objects will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereafter. Summary of the Invention The rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinder of the present invention eliminates all of the prior art difficulties by providing a molded plastic base cylinder of substantially the size and shape of the rotogravure cylinder required, which is plated about its entire peripheral surface with either copper or nickel and then etched. In the preferred embodiment, polypropylene is employed as the plastic for the cylinder. In one embodiment, the cylinder is provided with a single bore along the central axis of the cylinder to accommodate the rotation inducing shaft of the printing apparatus. Another embodiment employs axially extending arcuately disposed fingers or lugs which engage the ends of the cylinder and are mounted to a rotationally driven plate. By employing a molded plastic base for the rotogravure cylinder of the present invention, a cylinder is commercially obtainable, having perfect balance and perfect concentricity about its central axis. This heretofore unobtainable result is now realized by providing a molded plastic base which comprises both isotonic and isotropic distribution of the plastic throughout the cylindrical base. Since the isotonic and isotropic bases are stress and void free, every point on the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder exhibits precisely identical compression resistant forces. Since the cylinder base is plastic, the cylinder base of the present invention is easily and economically machined to have an outer peripheral surface which is perfectly concentric with the central axis of the cylinder. This perfect concentricity coupled with a precision balanced driving system, which is also perfectly concentric to the central axis of the cylinder, assures a statically and dynamically balanced rotogravure cylinder capable of performing at high speeds with complete and consistent results for the typical long duration rotogravure runs. The necessity for having a completely perfectly balanced and concentric rotogravure printing cylinder is clear from the operation of a rotogravure printing system in which it is imperative that the entire etched surface of the rotogravure printing cylinder comes into complete contact with the paper or print medium in order to provide the desired results.Prior art cylinders all have difficulty in this area, generally due to the internal bending of the cylinder against the pressure of the roller or due to imperfect concentricity of the cylinder surface or imperfect balance. This imbalance and imperfect concentricity is then further compounded by the high speed operation of the rotogravure printing system and the heavy weight of these prior art printing cylinders, causing the cylinders to run in continuously increasing elliptical paths due to the unequal centrifugal pull exerted by the heavy weight of the prior art cylinders. Clearly, the inherently balanced cylinder of the present invention eliminates all of these prior art difficulties and provides a unique and operative rotogravure or intagli o printing cylinder. Furthermore, by employing a molded plastic based cylinder which is plated with the desired metal surface, a rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinder is obtained which is extremely lightweight and easily handled. The molded plastic base cylinder is preferably either driven by a bore through the central axis of the cylinder at a diameter equal to the driving shaft diameter or by end driving plates. In this way, the resulting rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinder, which is obtained after coating and engraving or etching, incorporates a uniform cross sectional area throughout its length at right angles to the central axis, and a constant uniform material density throughout the entire cylinder, completely stress and void free. Consequently, every point on the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder has exactly the same amount of resistance to buckling or deformation as every other point thereof. Another advantage of the cylinder of the present invention is its ability to easily withstand the high pressures which result during the printing process without any deformation at any point of the cylinder. This same result is also achieved with an even lighter plastic cylinder by carefully engineering the amount and position of the material removed for the weight relief, while still maintaining the structural integrity of the cylinder itself. Furthermore, since the rotogravure printing cylinder of the present invention incorporates a base material capable of being manufactured by pouring, casting, or extruding the plastic material in a suitable mold or die, a large variety of different diameters and lengths can be easily obtained.Also, any desired driving shaft size can be accommodated by merely boring the base cylinder to the desired diameter. As a result, all requirements for varying diameters and lengths for any particular printing operation can be achieved quickly and inexpensively. The gravure plate of the present invention overcomes all of the prior art objections by providing an inexpensive, easily handled, plastic base with an etchable metal surface.Preferably the plastic base is extruded in a single sheet having the desired thickness, plated with an etchable metal, and then cut to the particular size required. In this way, an image ready transfer plate is provided which can be maintained as a stock item, ready for direct engraving or etching of the desired image or information into the etchable metal surface and immediate use of the resulting gravure plate. Throughout this specification both etching and engraving are used synonymously and interchangeable to represent any method or specific process desired by which the desired image or information is formed in the surface metal of the cylinders and plates of this invention. As previously mentioned, the gravure process is capable of achieving color variation by altering both the area of the etching and the depth of the etching. This capability in the gravure process provides superior tonal variation control than is obtainable with raised surface printing wherein only the area can be varied to achieve the tonal variations. As a result, the gravure process is extremely advantageous but heretofore had only been employable for a specific product line because of the expense and difficulty of obtaining and setting a gravure press. With the easily handled, inexpensive gravure cylinders and plates of the present invention, this high quality printing process can be used in a greater variety of applications wherein the use of the process up till now would not have been feasible,. The invention accordingly comprises the several steps and the relation of one or more such steps with respect to each of the others, and the articles possessing the features, properties, and relation of elements, which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims. THE DRAWINGS For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a conventional rotogravure printing machine incorporating one embodiment of the rotogravure cylinder of the present invention FIGURE 2 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the molded base cylinder of the present invention ready for plating and etching FIGURE 3 is a side elevation view of the plastic base cylinder of FIGURE 2 mounted for plating, partially submerged in a plating bath FIGURE 4 is a cross sectional side elevation view of one embodiment of the rotogravure printing cylinder of the present invention taken along line 4 4 of FIGURE 5 FIGURE 5 is a front elevation view partially in crosssection of one embodiment of the image transfer ready cylinder of the present invention wherein the keyway shafting bore can best be seen FIGURE 6 is a front elevation view of the plastic base cylinder of the present invention similar to FIGURE 3, with the cylinder mounted for plating FIGURE 7 is a perspective view partially in crosssection of the gravure or intaglio plate of the present invention FIGURE 8 is a cross sectional elevation view of a second embodiment of the plastic base rotogravure printing cylinder of the present invention incorporating an alternate driving system and FIGURE 9 is a front elevation view of the cylinder driving plate of the driving system of FIGURE 8. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In FIGURE 1, the rotogravure cylinder 20 of the present invention is shown mounted on a typical rotogravure printing machine 22. Cylinder 20 incorporates an outer peripheral surface 26 in which a design or image 28 has been etched.Design 28 is etched on surface 26 of cylinder 20 throughout the entire outer peripheral surface thereof, or as otherwise required by the art work. For simplicity, only a portion of design 28 is shown. In juxtaposed spaced relationship to cylinder 20 is impression roller 24 which is in intimate contact with rotogravure cylinder 20 during the printing operation. Cylinder 20 is partially immersed in an ink tray 25 and is in frictionally engagement with a doctor blade 27, which wipes off the excess ink returning.this. xcess to ink tray 25. The web of substrate or paper 29 to be printed passes between rotogravure cylinder 20 and impression roller 24 and is maintained in firm intimate contact with cylinder 20 by properly adjusting roller 24. As fully described above, the rotogravure printing process is extremely advantageous since the depth of the et ching on the surface is controllably varied as well as the area of the etching, in order to control tonal variations of the printed material. As a result, the intimate contact of the substrate or paper 29, upon which the printing is placed, with cylinder 20 is extremely important in order to assure the transfer of all available ink to the printing surface and to achieve the tonal variations obtainable from the cylinder.As a result, impression roller 24 must maintain constant force and pressure on the rotogravure cylinder 20 with printing paper 29 moving therebetween, in order to assure the desired printed result. In typical rotogravure printing, impression roller 24 maintains a constant force of about 150 pounds per linear inch against the printing cylinder 20. This force is dependent upon the material being printed and may range between about 50 and 300 pounds per linear inch. Impression roller 24 generally comprises a metal tube 60, which incorporates bearings for rotation, with a natural or synthetic rubber or other synthetic material covering 61. The radial thickness of covering 61 generally ranges between 1 4 of an inch to 1 inch with 3 8 of an inch being typical. Also, covering 61 has a hardness between 600 and 900, measured on the Shore A scale, with a Shore hardness of 800 being typical. Due to the constant, high, equi distributed, compressive force applied to the cylinder by roller 24, every point on the outer peripheral surface of cylinder 20 must resist this excessive pressure without any buckling or deformation. If the surface of cylinder 20 were to deform under the pressure exerted by impression roller 24, that particular area of the cylinder would not print on the surface of paper 29 as the paper passes across it, and the desired fully printed final product would not be achieved. Also, since rotogravure printing machines generally operate at high speeds with little or no manual control during the operation, it is extremely important that the cylinder functions properly throughout the entire printing operation in order to prevent any misprinted paper which would result in an extremely expensive shutdown and repair. Cylinder Construction In FIGURE 2, one embodiment of plastic base 30 of this invention is shown prior to plating, with keyway bore 32 incorporated therein extending along the central axis of cylinder 30. In this embodiment, plastic base cylinder 30 is manufactured by casting or pouring polypropylene in a mold of the desired diameter which may incorporate a tapered plug for providing keyway shafting bore 32. Also, the cylinder can be manufactured by extrusion of the plastic through a suitable die. Since it is important to manufacture a plastic cylindrical base which is both isotonic and isotropic, care must be exercised in producing the plastic base cylinder 30. It has been found that isotonic and isotropic plastic billets, which are both stress and void free, can most economically be manufactured in one of three preferred ways. The first method is in situ in which a mold or suitable cavity is filled with dry resin. Then, the mold and resin unit is slowly brought to the melt temperature and then slowly cooled down. If desired, vacuum may be used in order to remove air bubbles. The second preferred method is a casting process in which the resin is first pre melted and degassed in an extruder or similar apparatus, and then the plastic resin melt is poured into a suitable mold or cavity which has been preheated. The entire cavity and resin unit must be insulated and allowed to slowly cool down. Again, vacuum may be desirable in order to remove air bubbles. The final process in which a suitable plastic base cylinder can be economically produced is through extrusion.In this process, the plastic resin is pre melted and extruded through a suitable die into sn insulated receiver. Then theextruded product must be annealed after cooling in order to release stresses. If care is not exercised both in the cooling process and in the annealing process, shrink voids may form which, of course, would render the cylinder totally ineffective. After the molding operation, cylinder 30 is removed and trimmed to the exact diameter desired for the cylinder prior to plating. Also, as is more fully described below, it is desirable to form rounded corners 34 at both ends of the cylinder during the trimming operation in order to prevent any plating build up in these areas. It has been found that machining the plastic cylinder prior to plating is advantageous for obtaining the precise diameter cylinder required, while also providing an outer peripheral surface which is more receptive of the plating material. This peripheral trimming process is extremely important if agents have been used in the resin mixture, since most addition agents migrate during the manufacture of the plastic part to the outer periphery of the plastic unit.This creates a non isotonic periphery which will not affect the balance of the cylinder but will affect bonding, since a concentration of agents weakens the outer surface. Consequently, trimming the outer diameter of the cylinder removes the nonisotonic layer and assures a strong bond with the plating metal. Preferably, a universally applicable base cylinder is formed, without a shaft bore, since the shaft bore if so desired can easily be machined during the trimming operation.This procedure is preferred since 1 shaft diameters vary, 2 a precision sized bore can most economically be achieved by boring the shaft receiving hole after the molding operation and 3 alternative driving methods may be desired. In any case, the shafting bore is preferable constructed with a concentricity of 0.0005 inches. In this way, the requisite balance is achieved. After extensive research of various plastic materials, it was discovered that polypropylene provided the most unique combination of characteristics for use as the cylinder base. In part icular, polypropylene has a low molecular weight, is solvent resistant, has sufficient hardness, is platable, can be easily molded, can be easily machined, is strong and is of relatively low cost. Another plastic material which has been found to also have sufficient combination of characteristics to be usable as the cylinder is polyphenylene sulfide. Other plastics could be employed but are believed to be less desirable. As is well known in the art, by incorporating fillers into the plastic material during the molding process, additional specific characteristics may be obtained. One of the advantages that can be achieved by employing fillers in the molded plastic material is that the adhesion and platability of the plastic can be enhanced. Also the mechanical properties or physical characteristics of the plastic can also be enhanced.Generally, such fillers as glass, carbon, asbestos, metallic flakes, or silica are employed. However, the use of fillers is not mandatory for the successful plating of the plastic cylinder of this invention since the entire outer surface of the cylinder is plated.As a result, the use of fillers is not required. In fact, the use of fillers is not suggested for the cylinder of this invention, unless the filler is homogeneously distributed throughout the entire plastic cylinder. This arrangement is preferred, since the plastic cylinder of the present invention can best be utilized by manufacturing a generally required diameter and machining the diameter down to the desired specifications. As a result, if only surface fillers are employed, the effect of the filler will not be obtained if the cylinder diameter is machined below the effective depth of the filler. However, the use of fillers is more desirable in the construction of the metal plated, plastic base printing plate of this invention. In the construction of the plastic base for the plate, surface fillers which promote the adhesion of an etchable metal to its surface may be very useful since adhesion becomes an important factor when encapsulation of the entire plastic base is not anticipated. As described above, the plastic base cylinder of the present invention is preferably manufactured in a single molding operation as an entire homogeneous cylinder which is then machined to the desired outer diameter and also machined to incorporate the desired driving system, which incorporates, in the two preferred embodiments, a cylindrically shaped, elongated shafting bore along the central axis of the cylinder. It has been found that the use of either a keyed shafting bore, through which the desired shaft is secured, or endformed driving lug cavities, provides substantially greater advantages over the typical system of molding metal inserts into the cylinder for use as a shaft. Since plastics are not very compatible with metal inserts and the inclusion of a metal insert for a shaft adds weight and adds to the shipping cost as well as complicating the chemistry of the plating treatment, a shaft less cylinder is preferred.Furthermore, the incorporation of a shaft into the cylinder itself would require a greater variety of molds than is presently required by merely boring out the shaft hole.Consequently greater flexibility and variety of diameter sizes for various shaft sizes can be achieved with the systems presented in this disclosure. As discussed above in reference to Figure 2, one embodiment of the driving system for the rotogravure cylinder of the present invention is the use of the keyway bore 32 through which a cooperating shaft is mounted in order to drive cylinder 20 of the present invention. Although keyway bore 32 is preferred for its simplicity of manufacture and use, various potential problems may develop during its use. Clearly, the effective operative use of cylinder 20 of the present invention depends upon the successful power transmission from the rotationally inducing drive source to surface 26 of cylinder 20, with sufficient consistency and dependability to overcome the force of the friction drive of impression roller 24 and cause the printing media 29 to be frictionally driven therebetween. Since cylinder 20 is driven along its center line, it is necessary to transmit and distribute the driving forces from the center line of the drive shaft out through base 30 to surface 26 where the rotary shear forces are induced at the interface between cylinder 20 and impression roller 24. Although the use of a keyway shaft has been successfully employed in driving steel cylinders and is employable with the plastic base 30 of the present invention, it has been found that when the load placed upon surface 26 of cylinder 20 approaches 200 psi, potential driving failure may result.Although no such failure results in a steel cylinder, the shear strength of steel is about 29,000,000 while the shear strength of plastic is about 290,000. Consequently, as the load forces approach 200 psi, the keyway driving shaft will attain a driving force as a moment of torque which could exceed the modulus of elasticity of cylinder 20. Such an occurrence will produce improper driving of cylinder 20, requiring a shutdown of the rotogravure printing system. In order to overcome potential power transmission problems, an alternative driving system has been developed.This system in its preferred embodiments is shown in Figures 8 and 9. In this embodiment, base 30 incorporates a plurality of lug receiving cavities 60 formed in both ends of base 30, along with a plate receiving cavity 63 similarly formed on both ends of base 30 and cooperating with lug receiving cavities 60. The actual number of lug receiving cavities 60 which are f rme An base 0 and their precise position depends upon both the design considerations and force requirements to which the cylinder will be exposed. However, each lugreceiving cavity is preferably formed in base 30 at the optimum radial distance from the center line of base 30.The optimum radial spacing for the lug receiving cavities depends upon many factors such as base material, driving forces required, base diameter, and diameter of alternate bases to be driven by same equipment. With these major factors in mind, the optimum lug cavity position is determined and then formed in the ends of the base with extreme precision. Base 30 also incorporates an elongated shaft receiving bore 64 extending entirely through base 30. In the preferred embodiment, shaft receiving bore 64 comprises a concentricity of 0.0005 inches. This embodiment of the driving system of the present invention is then completed by providing an elongated shaft 65, a fixed driving flange 61, and an adjustably positionable lockable driving flange 66. Shaft 65 is manufactured with concentricity tolerances identical to shaft receiving bore 64 and a diameter to which shafting receiving bore 64 was made. In this way, a rotationally driven shaft is provided along which cylinder 30 can be mounted in order to achieve an intrinsically balanced cylinder construction. Flange 61 is securely mounted to shaft 65 and incorporates a substantially flat plate member 67 and a plurality of outwardly projecting lugs 62 which are securely journaled in or mounted to plate 67. The actual radial position of lug 62 about plate 67 and the arcuate distances between the lugs is a matter of design choice, as discussed above in reference to lug receiving cavities 62 of base 30. However, a typical lug construction and arrangement is shown in Figure 9. Since lug receiving cavities 60 and plate receiving cavity 63 are constructed to be identically compatible with lugs 62 and plate 67, base 30 when mounted on shaft 65 is moved axially along shaft 65 until each lug 62 is securely positioned within a lug receiving cavity 60 and plate 67 is securely contained in plate receiving cavity 63 at the first end of base 30. The driving system is then completed and ready for a successful driving operation by securely positioning adjustably positionable, lockable flange system 66 in position with lugs 62 of plate 68 thereof securely retained in lug receiving cavities 60 and plate 68 secured in plate receiving cavity 63 at the other end of base 30. Once driving flanges 61 and 66 are securely positioned in their receiving cavities ready for rotationally driving base 30, flange 66 is locked in position, and the rotogravure cylinder of the present invention is ready for operation. Although a plurality of various systems can be employed to provide an adjustably positionable, lockable flange, one embodiment for this sliding and lockable flange assembly is shown in Figure 8. In this embodiment, multi positionable, lockable flange assembly 66 also comprises a locknut 70, a threaded extension member 71, journaled in plate 68 and extending therefrom in a direction opposite from lugs 62, and an adjustable, slidable, collar assembly 72. Collar assembly 72 comprises a split ring, shaft engaging collar and ascrew locking. means 73 for securely locking collar 72 in any position along shaft 65. In operation, the sliding and locking flange assembly 66 is secured and locked in any desired position by first adjustably sliding flange assembly 66 along shaft 65 until lugs 62 and plate 68 are securely positioned within their respective cavities. Then, screw means 73 is tightened causing the arms of split ring collar 72 to advance towards each other, and securely and lockingly engage shaft 65. The flange locking is then completed by rotating locknut 70 in the direction causing plate 68 to advance axially into base 30 against locked collar assembly 72, thereby assuring secure receiving cavities. It is important to note that by employing a plurality.of radially positioned lugs which engage plastic base 30 in a plurality of receiving cavities, the surface area employed for driving plastic base 30 is substantially increased to an optimum area which will assure that all driving forces are easily overcome. In this way, the lower shear strength of plastic base 30 will not in any way affect its performance as an operative rotogravure printing cylinder. Providing a reliable driving system for the plastic base cylinder of the present invention which assures the cylinder s performance as an operative rotogravure printing cylinder is extremely important, since the plastic base rotogravure printing cylinder of the present invention provides a variety of important benefits heretofore unattainable with prior art systems. The major benefits obtained with the cylinder of the present invention is the attainment of an intrinsically balanced rotogravure cylinder which is both dynamically and statically balanced. Also, the plastic base possesses an inherent quality of self lubrication, which allows a closely toleranced shaft bore construction while still providing an easily achievable slide fit of the shaft through the cylinder s shaft bore regardless of the length of the cylinder. Finally, the present invention achieves an image ready rotogravure cylinder base which can be easily adapted to any printing press journal configuration without any variation in the basic design of the cylinder itself. These extremely important considerations, along with the considerations and advantages stated above, clearly show that the rotogravure printing cylinder of this present invention overcomes the prior art problems, that have heretofore gone totally unresolved, and attains a totally new concept for an operative rotogravure printing cylinder. Plating Once the base plastic cylinder has been molded, machined to the desired diameter with the shafting bore machined therethrough, the plastic base cylinder is ready for plating.It has been found that a variety of metals can be electrodeposited upon the plastic base cylinder, with copper plating preferred for its low cost and ease of workability. The plating process can best be understood by referring to Figures 3 and 6 wherein plastic base cylinder 30 is shown mounted for rotation in electyolyte reservoir 36. Plastic base cylinder 30 is mounted on a titanium shaft 38 which is connected for rotating plastic base cylinder 30 in electrolyte reservoir 36. In prior art plating processes, current conduction presented no difficulty since the base material was metallic. However, in the present invention, the use of plastic base cylinder 30 presents additional problems since the plastic is in of itself non conductive. As a result, current connections are made by employing bronze or brass sleeves 40 on titanium shaft 38 along with copper endplates 42 mounted at both ends of base cylinder 30. In this way, the titanium shaft picks up the current through brass sleeve 40. Also, a brass ring 41 is employed near the end of shaft 38 to pick up the cathode current and a non conductive spacer 43 is employed between brass rings 40 and 41 in order to maintain the desired spacing therebetween. The preferred anode employed are bar copper anodes 44 which are located parallel to the face of base cylinder 30.It has been found that the best plating is attained by employing anodes parallel and equidistant to the axis of the cylinder. During the plating operation, base cylinder 30 is rotated by means of the titanium shaft 38 which can be controlled by any suitable variable speed motor drive through drive connection 45. The electrolyte tank in which electrolyte 36 is contained may be independent of base cylinder 30, titanium shaft 38, and the various driving and current conducting equipment.In this way, the tank can be mounted on a lifting device which allows the tank and its contained electrolyte to be raised up to base cylinder 30 in order to permit immersion of base cylinder 30 up to 50 or more of its diameter during the electrodepositing process. Although this arrangement is not required, the flexibility achieved has been found to be advantageous. After the metal has been deposited onto plastic base cylinder 30 in a sufficient amount to achieve the desired diameter, the metal plated plastic base cylinder is removed from the plating tank. As shown in Figure 4, after electrodeposition of the metal peripheral surface, intaglio printing cylinder 20 comprises a cylinder incorporating a shafting bore 32, a plastic base cylinder 30 and an outer peripheral metal deposited coating 46, which encapsulates the plastic base and is ready for final polishing and etching. Preferably, metal plated coating 46 is of a sufficient depth to exceed the exact outer diameter requirement for the rotogravure or intaglio printing cylinder. As a result, cylinder 20 is then polished to impart the desired surface characteristics to metal plating 46 while also achieving the precise diameter desired in the particular rotogravure printing system.After the polishing operation, cylinder 20 which is at this time an image transfer ready cylinder is then sent for etching of the particular information on to metal plated surface 46 in order to impart the particular printing information to cylinder 20. In the preferred embodiment, the etchable metal coating comprises a thickness of at least 0.010 inches and no greater than 0.040 inches. Furthermore, the metal surface should have a hardness of at least 140 Vickers when measured on theVickers Scale. In order to plate the surface of the cylinder of this invention with an etchable metal, a variety of plating processes can be employed. Many techniques have been tested and each have been found to produce a plated cylinder capable of being polished and etched to form the metal plated plastic base intaglio printing cylinder of this invention. Basically, the plating processes comprise first conditioning the peripheral surface of the plastic cylinder with various conditioning agents in order to establish a surface which is readily receptive of the metal being electrodeposited. Once the surface is properly conditioned, the cylinder is placed in an electrolytic plating bath in order to deposit a thin coating of the etchable metal on the surface of the cylinder.This electrolytic plating, if employed, renders the previously non conductive surface conductive. Then, the cylinder is mounted as described above in the electrolyte reservoir and rotated while the etchable metal is plated about the entire exposed surface of the plastic base cylinder. Once the desired thickness of metal has been deposited onto the surface of the plastic. base, the metal plated plastic base cylinder is polished to the exact diameter desired for the particular rotogravure process, and the image transfer ready cylinder is then engraved or etched with the desired image or information, and is then ready for use in the printing equipment. Although a variety of plating techniques can be employed, it has been found that plastic treatment followed by an electrolytic plating exposure and then electrodeposition of copper, provides the most economical plating technique. The outer surface of the plastic base is first treated with a conditioning solution which develops sites on the plastic surface where bonds between the plastic and the copper deposit may be established. The conditioning agent also renders the plastic surface wettable by the subsequent electrolytic copper solution. After the application of the conditioning solution, the surface is treated with an acid bath and then further treated with additional surface preparation solutions.These additional solutions further enhances the plastic surface for the subsequent plating by making the surface more receptable to the formation of an adherent, fine grain metallic deposit. If desired, the surface can be treated with a solution which deposits a thin metallic film on the surface of the plastic in order to further promote the deposition of the desired adherent, fine grain, metal deposit Next, the cy linder is placed in an electrolytic copper bath to establish a thin copper coating on the cylinder surface. In this way, the previously non conductive surface becomes conductive. Once the surface of the plastic base cylinder has been properly treated and coated, the cylinder is mounted in a copper electro plating bath and rotated, as described above, until the desired thickness of copper has been deposited on the entire exposed surface of the plastic base cylinder. The copper surface is then treated in a manner well known in the art in order to provide a clean, bright copper surface ready for polishing and etching. A firm, tightly engaging bond between the plastic base and metallic plate is not required, as has been generally taught in prior art references. However, due to the different thermal expansion properties inherent in the plastic base and the metallic coating, some degree of adhesion between the interfacing, contacting surfaces of these materials is preferred in order to prevent unwanted detachment. According to resin manufacturers, the typical plastic polymer for the cylindrical base of the present invention has a thermal expansion co efficient of 6 at 250C 1000C and, according to the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, copper has a thermal expansion co efficient of 16.8 at 25 C 100 C. Under these conditions, an adhesion of 9.6 pounds per inch has been found to be sufficient to permit normal thermal cycling without any detachment problems.This normal thermal cycling inciudes temperature changes.through all stages of manufacture, elevated warehouse temperatures encountered during storage, and temperature rises encountered in the printing press due to friction or contact with a hot substrate. Although 9.6 pounds per inch has been found to be preferred, at similar adhesion would be within the scope of this disclosure, as well as vastly different adhesion rates, when alternative materials or conditions are employed. One example of a plating process for the electrodeposition of copper, which has been found to provide an extremely strong and adherent copper surface on the plastic base of this invention, is described below in detail. The surface conditioning, surface preparation, and plating solutions defined in this particular process are identified by trade names employed by Enthone, Incorporated of West Haven,Connecticut The solutions defined are all readily available in the industry and are used in this disclosure as examples of the types of solutions and electrolytes which can be employed in the plating process. The first step in the process is to treat the surface of the plastic base cylinder of the present invention withEnplate Conditioner 474 at 150oF. for 20 minutes. This is then followed by a water rinse. The second step is to additionally treat the surface of the plastic base cylinder of this invention with 20 hydrochloric acid by volume for one minute followed by a water rinse. Then the plastic base cylinder is treated with Enplate Sensitizer 432 for one minute, water rinsed, and then treated with Enplate Activator 440 for one minute followed by a water rinse. The plastic base cylinder is then placed in the electrolytic plating bath which contains Enplate Electrolytic Copper Cu 404 and maintained in this bath for 15 minutes and then water rinsed.Then the cylinder is placed in sulfuric acid, 5 per cent by volume, for one minute and water rinsed. The fully treated and coated cylinder is then mounted on a titanium shaft and secured on the shaft in position with the various collars and associated conductive material mounted on the shaft on both ends of the cylinder, as fully described above. The entire assembly is then secured for rotation in the electrolyte tank which contains EnthobriteCu 942. The cylinder is rotated in the copper electrolyte until the desired thickness of copper is built up on the exposed cylinder surface. Generally, a surface coating of about 0.015 inches is desirable. The resulting copper plated plastic based cylinder is then water rinsed, dried, and treated in the manner well known in the art for providing the copper plate with the desired finished qualities. Once the copper plated plastic based cylinder is polished, the image transfer ready cylinder of this invention is completed, ready for etching or engraving in the conventional manner to produce the rotogravure printing cylinder of this invention. Alternate plating processes which can be employed in order to provide the plastic base cylinder with an etchable metal surface can be found in the following references Metallic Coating Of Plastics, Vol. 2 William Goldy, Chapter 26, pages 359 374. Principles of Electroplating and Electroforming, 3rd edition, Blum and Hogaboom, Chap. VIII, pages 220 235. Canning Handbook On Electroplating, 21st edition, Chapter 27, pages 683 694. As shown in Figure 2 and referred to above, the incorporation of rounded edges 34 in plastic base cylinder 30 assures that any build up of electrodeposited coating 46 on base cylinder 30 at these corners will not exceed the overall diameter of printing cylinder 20, as shown in Figure 5. It has been found that if rounded corners 34 have not been incorporated in the base cylinder 30, additional build up of electrodeposited material 46 will result at the corner and thereby produce additional post plate machining to avoid undesirable degradation of the doctor blade during the printing and inking operation.However, it is important to note that rounded corners 34 must be employed in combination with proper anode. arrangement in order to assure that no undesirable plating build up occurs at the corners. Furthermore, current density shields, well known in the art, can also be employed to control the metal build up at the corners. Cylinder Advantages The attainment of an operative rotogravure printing cylinder having a gravure metallic surface totally supported by a plastic base possesses numerous advantages over prior art cylinders, many of which have been discussed throughout this Application. The major advantages achieved by the present invention are 1 a substantial reduction in weight, 2 perfect intrinsically obtained balance, both dynamically and statically, 3 repeatable economic manufacturability of support base with isotonic and isotropic qualities, 4 handling ease, 5 maintenance of precision level tolerances with ease and reproducibility, 6 self lubricating qualities for slidability of precision made shaft through shaft bore regardless of length of cylinder, 7 deflection resistance, and 8 adaptability to any printing press configuration without modification of basic cylinder design. These features are then enhan ced and made realistic by providing the rotogravure printing cylinder of the present invention with a driving system capable of delivering these unique advantageous qualities to a printing press. The combination of the plastic base cylinder and the proper driving system assures rotational driving of the plastic base rotogravure printing cylinder of this invention, in a rotogravure printing press with all of the pressures, frictional forces, and long running operational requirements being attained and all of the prior art difficulties eliminated. Among the most important physical characteristics obtained by the cylindrical plastic supporting base of this invention are its isotonic and isotropic qualities. By achieving a supporting base which is reproduceably and economically manufactured with stress and void free characteristics in combination with complete, total homogeneity of the support material throughout the entire cylindrical base, the plastic supporting base of this invention establishes an intrinsically balanced cylinder, which realizes deflectionfree operation under the pressure loads encountered in rotogravure printing. As shown in Figures 5 and 8, both embodiments of the intaglio and rotogravure printing cylinder 20 incorporates a precision made shaft bore, which extends axially along the entire length of printing cylinder 20. In this way, each and every vertical cross section of the cylinder 20 which is taken perpendicularly through the shafting bore will result in identical cross sectional areas, since the. entire printing cylinder 20 is isotropic, comprising an identical compos ition density throughout its entire length. Also, cylinder 20 is isotonic being completely stress and void free. Consequently, the pressure applied to cylinder 20 during the printing operation will have identical resisting forces at every point on the outer peripheral surface of cylinder 20.In this way, any areas which may otherwise result in buckling or forced deformation during the printing operation are completely eliminated. Consequently, cylinder 20 comprises a printing cylinder capable of thoroughly and completely resisting all of the compressive forces placed thereon during the printing operation without any deformation or buckling of the printing surface. This built in force resistance of cylinder 20 is extremely important in assuring that the superior advantages of rotogravure printing such as tonal variation control, high production, long continuous operation, and infinitely variable repeat information, can be achieved with the inexpensive, easilyhandled cylinder of this invention. Obviously, this achievement provides a more desirable print quality, imparts greater confidence in the printing cylinder for constant and consistent printing results throughout the entire length of the run, and allows other heretofore unthought of printed product lines to employ the rotogravure cylinder of this invention at an economical cost. Since rotogravure printing, as discussed above, employs a series of rollers all rotating at high speeds, dynamic and static balance of the printing cylinder is extremely important in order to assure normal production rates as well as maintain the required close register and reduce machine and cylinder wear. By providing an isotonic plastic supporting cylindrical base, having a shaft receiving bore which is toleranced to 0.0005 inches to the center line of the cylinder, the cylindrical plastic supporting base is intrinsically balanced and capable of meeting all of the operational requirements of the rotogravure printing press. This achievement provides a new concept, completely divergent from the classic tubes and gudgeons employed in rotogravure printing systems which are intrinsically unbalanced. By referring to various well established formulas for balance and deflection, the attainment of an intrinsically balanced, deflection resistant, plastic base rotogravure printing cylinder is better understood from a theoretical basis. In the basic formula for determining the sensitivity of a balance, assuming the three knife edges of a balance lie on a straight line, the deflection theta e produced by any imbalance is represented by tan THETA mL Mh In this formula, M is the we ight of the beam, h is the distance of the center of gravity or balance point below the knife edge in this case the center line of the shaft to the center of gravity, m is the small mass or amount of imbalance, and L is. the length of the beam . From this formula, it can be seen that when an intrinsically balanced cylinder, which possesses a low modulus of elasticity, is compared to an intrinsically unbalanced cylinder of a h igh modulus of elasticity under identical conditions of loading and rotation, the dynamic sum of deflection will be less in the balanced cylinder than in the unbalanced cylinder. The next critical calculation important for rotogravure cylinders is a measurement of its actual deflection.Rotogravure cylinder bases are generally manufactured to performance specifications based on the classic formula for calculating deflection in a simple beam, uniformly loaded.This formula is as follows 4 MAX DEFLECTION 5w1 , where 384EI w wt. load unit length 1 length of cylinder E Modulus of elasticity I Moment of Inertia Also, in order to obtain the maximum impression for the maximum deflection, the following formula is employed DELTA MAY M. Defl 384 Mod Elas 1 5 1 to 4th Power As shown in these formulas, maximum deflection is directly proportional to the weight of the cylindrical base.Consequently, the substantial reduction of the weight of a rotogravure cylinder, which is achieved with the plastic base rotogravure printing cylinder of this invention, produces a substantial reduction of the maximum deflection The other important variable in this formula is the modulus of elasticity, since the modulus of elasticity of the plastic base is about 1 10 of the modulus of elasticity of a steel base. It ha s been found that by providing the isotonically distributed cylindrical plastic base of this invention with its stress and void free characteristics with a modulus of elasticity of at least 250,000 psi, the plastic base rotogravure printing cylinder of this invention will perform as a rotogravure cylinder wherein maximum deflection under dynamic conditions will not result in loss of print quality due to unequal pressures. The achievement of this result is also dependent upon the shaft bore having a concentricity of 0.0005 inches to the outer circumference for a slide fit of the steel shaft, which is typically and preferably fabricated from AlSl C1045 hot rolled carbon steel or grade with similar properties, with the plastic base cylinder having electrodeposited circumferential shell of copper with.a thickness of between .010 inches and .040 inches and a hardness of 140 Vickers measured on the Vickers Scale.Under these preferred conditions, the plastic based rotogravure cylinder of this invention provides a rotogravure cylinder capable of achieving the operative standards placed upon rotogravure printing systems regardless of the force requirements and pressure demands of the rotogravure printing press. Plate Construction and Advantages For simplicity of disclosure, the foregoing description has concentrated on the rotogravure cylinder of this invention, since the construction and operation of the cylinder presents various unique and complex problems However, many details contained in the foregoing description apply equally to the gravure plate construction of this invention and, although the cylinder is specifically mentioned, the substance of the foregoing disclosure should be interpreted as also applying to the plate construction of this invention where such interpretation is realistically applicable. In Figure 7, a garvure or intaglio plate image ready transfer 50 of this invention is shown with an etchable me tal surface 51 mounted to plastic base 52. As detailed above, although various etchabl e metals may be employed, it has been found that copper plating is best for economy and workability. Plastic base 52 may comprise various plastics, however, polypropylene has been found to be best suited for use as the base plastic. One of the major advantages of polypropylene, which is particularly significant with the use of plate 50, is the resistance polypropylene has to the degrading action of the inks employed in the printing process. Since metal surface 51 is preferably secured to only the top surface of base 52, the ink may well come into contact with plastic base 52 about the edges thereof.As a result, the use of a plastic, such as polypropylene, which has a physical characteristic extremely resistant to degradation by the ink, is an extremely significant factor which must be considered when selecting the particular plastic base. Plastic base 52 may be formed in a variety of plastic forming processes. However, it has been found that the formation of plastic base 52 by extrusion provides the most economical manufacturing method. Once the extruded elongated piece of plastic has been formed, the plastic base is plated with the etchable metal, cut to the desired size, and surface finished if required. Having obtained plastic base 52, the etachable metal is then secured to the top surface of plastic base 52. Again, various methods of depositing or securing etchable metal 51 to plastic base 52 are possible. Basically, the various processes can be divided into two most distinct techniques.One technique would be to electrodeposit a film of copper, or other etchable metal, onto the surface of plastic base 52, using a process similar to that detailed above. The other technique would be to employ a pre formed sheet of copper, or other suitable etchable metal which is cut to a desired size, and intimately bond the copper sheet to plastic base 52. Although either of these two basic approaches can be employed to obtain the gravure plate of this invention, it is believed that the deposition of the etchable metal on the plastic base provides the best method for achieving a secure intimate bond between etchable metal 51 and plastic base 52 which will resist all of the forces and corrosive climate to which the gravure plate will be subjected. Once etchable metal surface 51 has been intimately secured to plastic base 52, the metal surface is then polished in order to provide the surface with the desired surface characteristics. Then, as described above, the particular ima ge or information to be printed is directly engraved or etched into metal plate 51 in order to provide a gravure plate ready for operation. In one embodiment, the gravure plate of this invention is covered with photo resist after the plating and polishing operation. In this way, image ready transfer plate 50 will be res ponsive to ultraviolet light, upon exposure, in order to quickly and easily produce a gravure plate having the desired information or ima ge therein. If desired, the photo resist can be eliminated in order to provide image ready transfer plate 50 which is ready for direct etching or engraving, by other processes, whenever so required by the user. As previously discussed, gravure plates presently employed in the industry do not have the flexibility and inexpensive characteristics which are inherent in the gravure plate of the present invention. Because of the extremely high cost in manufacturing and producing the present day gravure plate, no such plate is capable of being maintained as a stock item and must be specially ordered for specific product lines. By employing the gravure plate of the present invention, an inexpensive, easily handled, readily available gravure plate is achieved which can be maintained as a stock item in a plurality of sizes.By having the metal plated plastic base plate of this invention an image transfer ready plate can be stocked and directly etched or engraved when its use is required, in order to quickly and efficiently attain the gravure plate needed for immediate production. In this way, greater flexibility and useability of gravure plates can be attained and the quality of work inherent in the gravure process can be expanded into areas where the use of this quality process has never been economically feasible, It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in carrying out the above process and in the construction set forth without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the invention which, as a matter of language, might be said to fall therebetween. Having described my invention, what I claim as new and desire to secure by Letters Patent is
