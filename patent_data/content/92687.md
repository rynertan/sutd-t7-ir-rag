EXAMPLE In oraer to test an automobile coolant composition for effectiveness with and without the use of nitrate, several compositions were formulated, as identified in Tabie I below. The base fluid consisted of an aqueous borate phosphate glycol compositon. Each of tne compositions given in Tangle I below was subzectea to standara potentioaynamic anode polarization tests using a Princeton Applied Research Hovel 350 testing apparatus to give two values on a pure aluminum sample, namely the general surface corrosion value for a given fluid tuorr and the tendency to pit value EBr . The tests were conaucted at room temperature with agitation of each of the compositions. The results are given in Table I below TABLE I ELECTROCHEMICAL DATA Fluid Composition ICorr EBr 10 1 BASE 5,000 1.3 10 2 SILICONE A 5,317 1.4 10 3 NITRATE 5,600 1.7 10 4 SILICONE A TITRATE 8,542 1.5 10 .5 SILICATE . 670 1.3 10 6 COPOLYMER A 596 1.2 10 7 SILICATE, NITRATE 1,190 1.8 10 8 COPOLYMER A , NITRATE 700 1.7 Silicone A is an organosiloxane within the scope of this invention which is commercially present in Prestone and was employed tor testing purposes here in an amount identical to the amount found therein. Copolymer A is a copolymer of the invention consisting ot the reaction product of Silicone A anaSilicate. The results, as given in Table I above, indicate that, for a given composition, the aadition of nitrate provides a reduction in the tendency to pit as measured by an increase in the EBr value. The silicate provides a reduction in the general surface corrosion as measured by a decrease in the ICorr value. The silicone alone shows no improvement in either tendency to pit or surface corrosion rate as compare to the base fluid. The combination of silicate ana nitrate shows a nigh general surface corrosion rate ICorr and a low tendency to pit EBH refer. to fluia 7 in Table I. The testing of fluia 8, in contrast, shows an unexpected improvement. The combination of nitrate with silicone silicate provides a minimal general surface corrosion rate, as indicated by the very lowICorr shown for fluid 8 of Table I, an a surprisingly effective protection against pit corrosion, as indicated by the high EBr value.
