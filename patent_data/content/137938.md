# Pneumatic position controller.

## Abstract
In a pneumatic position controller for controlling the position of a pneumatic servomotor 10 to a value deter mined by a pneumatic command pressure, the command pressure acts through a movable wall member 30 on a pivotable balancing member 40 . The balancing member 40 controls through a baffle plate 52 the outlet nozzle 56 of a peumatic amplifier 24 . The balancing member 40 is axially spaced from a feedback lever 44 , with aligned pivot axes. A helical torsion spring 50 has one end attached to the balancing member 40 and the other end attached to the feedback lever 44 . The feedback lever 44 is rotatable by the servomotor 10 . An advantageous and compact con struction permitted by the use of the helical torsion spring 50 is described.
