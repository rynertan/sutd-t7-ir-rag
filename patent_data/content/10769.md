# Adsorption separation method and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
Method for separating a starting fluid containing at least two components with different absorption character ic comprising a first step of feeding the starting fluid to an intermediate portion of the packed bed 1 to 3 while withdrawing a fluid rich in either of the components in a corresponding amount from a position downstream a second step of stopping the feed to and the withdrawal from the separator and moving the remaining fluid in a downward direction, and a third step of feeding a desor bent fluid to the separator and simultaneously with drawing a fluid rich in either of the components in a corresponding amout from a position downstream of the desorbent feed port, the withdrawal of the fluid being conducted at least in two portions, the adsorption bands being left in part of the packed bed 1 to 3 , in the third step, as well as an absorption separator for such method.
