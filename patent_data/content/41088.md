# A method for manufacturing textile reinforced conveyor beltings.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method for manufacturing tex tile reinforced conveyor beltings comprising subjecting the outer surfaces of a textile carcase constituted wholly of synth etic fibre yarns, or comprising at least a major proportion of synthetic fibre yarns, to a brushing or raising action so as to break and raise or to roughen a proportion of the filaments in the extreme outer yarns prior to impregnation and or coating of the carcase, for example with PVC or rubber or other polymeric or elastomeric material, so as to improve bondabil ity between the synthetic fibre and the impregnating or coat ing material.
