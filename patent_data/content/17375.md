# Exhaust gas sensor having porous metal impregnated ceramic element.

## Abstract
An improved sensor having a ceramic element 46 that undergoes a change in an electrical characteristic in re sponse to a change in the partial pressure of oxygen in a mixture of gases to which the ceramic element 46 is exposed. Sensors of this type are used to detect the air fuel ratio of mixtures supplied to internal combustion engines. Prior art sensors are characterized by little change in their respective electrical characteristics at low operating temper atures. A charge transfer material, platinum or platinum rhodium is applied to the ceramic element 46 to facilitate or make possible the electron transfers required for sensor operation at low temperatures.
