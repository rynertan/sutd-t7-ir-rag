# Method apparatus for forming a double walled thermoplasctic tube with integral bells and tube produced thereby.

## Abstract
Double walled thermoplastic tubes, with corrugated outer walls 18 and smooth inner walls 24 are formed with integral bell sections spaced along the tube. The outer, corrugated wall is formed with a bell section. One of the walls 18 is pierced between the ends of the bell section 34 to allow the escape of air, and the inner wall 24 is pressed outwards into engagement with the bell section 34 of the outer walls 18 .
