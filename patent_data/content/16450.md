# Synthetic fur and process for preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A synthetic fur closely resembling a natural fur comprises relatively long and thick guard hair like raised synthetic fibers, each having a transverse cross section wherein at least one constricted part is formed, and underfur like raised synthetic fibers, each having a rate of dissolution in a solvent or of hydrolysis with a hydrolyzing agent higher than that of said guard hair like raised fibers, and a length and fineness less than those of said guard hair like raised fibers. The synthetic fur is prepared by applying a viscous treating liquid contain ing a solvent or hydrolyzing agent to a raised surface of a fabric comprising relatively thick raised synthetic fibers, each having a transverse cross section wherein at least one con stricted part is formed, and relatively fine raised synthetic fibers, each having a rate of dissolution in the solvent or of hydrolysis with the hydrolyzing agent higher than that of said relatively thick raised fibers.
