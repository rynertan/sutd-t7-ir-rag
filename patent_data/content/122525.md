# PARALLEL SHIFT FAILURE RECONFIGURATION

## Abstract
A reconfigurable parallel group of identical functional units 11 and a method for reconfiguring this parallel grouping of identical functional units upon the occurrence of a failure by shifting the contents of the failed unit and the contents of all units 11 between the failed unit and a spare unit 20 one unit toward the spare unit 20. A paired system of input and output busses allows control lines 23, 25 to activate and deactivate the appropriate busses A or B of each unit 11, 20 so that a constant input output interface is maintained despite the fail ure provoked shift. This reconfigurable parallel group can also be stacked together to form larger configurations comprising various levels of reconfigurable parallel units or sub units.
