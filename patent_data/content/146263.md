Equation 6EMI14.1 The reaction is carried out at 78 C to 800C in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or nitroethane for 1 to 48 hours alone or in the presence of a FriedelCrafts catalyst as taught in U.S. 4,368,067 and 4.473.394. The sulfamoyl chloride intermediates X are prepared by reacting the heterocyclic amines III with chlorosulfonylisocyanate by methods taught in U.S. 4.401.816. The intermediate sulfonylisocyanates W . O and eulfonylisotbiocyanates W I S of Formula II fromEquation 1 can be prepared as shown in Equations 7. 8 and 9. As shown in Equation 7. many of the sulfonyl isocyanates of Formula Ila where J is other than J3 and J4 can be prepared by the reaction of sulfonamides of Formula IV with phosgene, in the presence of n butylisocyanate and a tertiary amine catalyst. at reflux in a solvent such as xylene by the method of U.S. Patent 4.238.621.Equation 7EMI14.2 The sulfonylisocyanates can also be prepared from the sulfonamides by a two step procedure involving a reacting the sulfonamides with butyl isocyanate in the presence of a base such as K2CO3 at reflux in an inert solvent such as 2 butanone forming a n butylsulfonylurea and b reacting this compound with phosgene and a tertiary amine catalyst at reflux in xylene solvent. The method is similar to a procedure taught by Ulrich and Sayigh. Newer Methods of Preparative Organic Chemistry. Vol. VI. p. 223 241.Academic Press, New York and London, W. Foerst Ed. Alternatively. as shown in Equation 8. many of the sulfonylisocyanates of Formula IIa can be prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides VIII with cyanic acid salts.EQuation 8 J SO2ClXI EMI15.1 J SO2N C O IIa The reaction is carried out at 25 to 100 C in an inert aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile for 0.5 24 hours in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide and an alkali metal salt such as lithium iodide according to the teachings of Japanese Patent No.76 26,816 Chem. Abst.. 85 77892e 1976 . Many of the sulfonylisothiocyanates of FormulaIIb where J is other than J3 and J4 can be prepared. as shown in Equation 9, by contacting the sulfonamides of Formula IV with carbon disulfide in the presence of two equivalents of a strong base. The resulting salt is then reacted with phosgene according to the teachings of K. Hartke. Arch. Pharm., 299. 174 1966 . Equation 9J SO2NH2 IVEMI15.2 J SO2N C S IIb The sulfonamides of Formula IV of Equations 2.3. 5. 7 and 9 are important intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of this invention.

Hawking and J. S. Lawrence. The Sul fonamides.N H. K. Lewis and Co.. London, 1950 and E. H. Northey. The Sulfonamides and Allied Compounds. Reinhold Publishing Corp.. New York. 1948. Alternatively. many sulfonamides IV can be prepared by dealkylation of their corresponding N tbutyl sulfonamides XII as shown in Equation 11.Equation 11 J SO2NHC CH3 3 XIICF3CO2HEMI16.2 HC1 CH30HIV The reaction is carried out by contacting theN t butyl sulfonamide XII with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or methanolic HC1 at 25 to 50 C for 0.5 to 24 hours. The N t butyl sulfonamides XII are readily prepared by reacting sulfonylchlorides XI with t butylamine and are useful either as an aid in purification. to enhance solubility for subsequent reactions such as Equation 12 below or to protect the sulfonamide function from competing with reactions at other parts of the molecule. Many of the unsaturated sulfonamides of FormulaIVa and IVb can be prepared from the corresponding saturated sulfonamides of Formula lvc and IVd by the two step procedure shown in Equation 12. G1 G2 isCO O. 502 NR6 CO NH4 or O SO2 and R is H orC CH3 3.Equation 12 a EMI17.1 The first step involves alpha bromination byN bromosuccinimide to give a monobromide which is subsequently dehydrobrominated in a second step by reaction with a suitable base such as triethylamine or potassium t butoxide in an inert solvent such as THF.This method has been used to prepare isocoumarins from 3.4 dihydroisocoumarins. see R. Barry. Chem. Rev.. 64, 229 1964 . In cases where R1 or R1 is a methyl function. competitive bromination at this site may occur resulting in a mixture. The desired bromide may be separated at this stage. or after treatment with the base, by standard methods. Many of the sulfonamides of Formula IVe and IVf can be prepared from sulfonamides of Formula IVg and IVh. respectively by dehalogenation as shown inEquation 13. G1 G2 G3 is Q CR2R3 CH .CO CR2R3 CH2. CO O CR4R5. SO2 NR6 CHR5. CO NR4 CHR5 or O SO2 CHR5 R1 and R are C1 orBr and R is H or C CH3 3.Equation 13EMI18.1 A typical dehalogenation method involves contacting the halo compound with zinc in aqueous acetic acid at 25 to 1000C for 0.5 to 24 hours. A variety of dehalogenation methods are known. for example. see H. D. Hartough. Thiophene andDerivatives. Vol. III of The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds. Interscience. New York. 1952. Additionally. as shown in Equation 14. many of the sulfonamides of Formula IVi and IVj can be prepared by oxidation of sulfonamides of Formula IVk and IV1. respectively. m is 1 or 2. R1 is notSCH3 and R is H or C CH3 3.Equation 14EMI19.1 The oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and sulfones are widely reported in the literature. for an overview see Organic Chemistry of Sulfur . PlenumPress, New York. 1977, S. Oae Ed. Many of the sulfonamides of Formula IVm and IVn can be prepared by functionalization of the corresponding N unsubstituted sulfonamides ofFormula IVo and IVp, respectively, as shown inEquation 15. G1 G2 is CH2 n CHR5 orCH CR5. R is H or C CH3 3 and X is Cl. Br, I or other readily displaceable groups. Equation 15EMI20.1 The reaction is carried out by contacting the sulfonamides IVo or IVp with the appropriate electrophile in the presence of a suitable base such as K2C03 in an inert. polar solvent such as DMF at 0 to 1000C for 0.5 to 24 hours. In some instances the R6 function can also be introduced by Michael addition of IVo or IVp to the appropriate Michael acceptor as known to one skilled in the art. While many of the R6 groups can be introduced directly. as described above. some of the R6 groups may best be prepared by standard functional group manipulations upon compounds of Formula IVm or IVn containing an appropriate R6 group precursor as will be known to one skilled in the art.Some examples of these manipulations are the preparation of IVm or IVn where R6 contains an epoxide by the expoxidation ofIVm or IVn where H6 contains a carbon carbon double bond. the preparation of IVm or IVn where R6 contains a sulk one by the oxidation of IVm or IVn where R6 contains a thioether function. the preparation of IVm or IVn where R6 containsOC O CH3 by acetylation of IVm or IVn where R6 contains OH. or the preparation of IVm or IVn where R6 contains NH2 by the reduction of IVm or IVn where R6 contains NO2. The sulfonyl chlorides of Formula XI of Equations 8 and 10 can be prepared by methods outlined inEquations 16 to 18. As shown in Equation 16. many of the sulfonyl chlorides of Formula XIa and XIb can be prepared from thiophenes of Formula XIIIa and XIIIb. respectively by direct chlorosulfonation. R1 is not H.Equation 16EMI21.1 Direct chlorosulfonation can be carried out by standard methods such as those cited by Hartough loc.cit. for the preparation of thiophene sulfonylchlorides. Por compounds of Formula XIIIa. R1 cannot be hydrogen in order to avoid chlorosulfonation at the more reactive 2 position of the heterocyclic ring. For compounds of Formula IXb. mixtures may result when R1 is hydrogen due to competitive chlorosulfonation at the 5 position of the heterocyclic ring. These isomers can be separated by standard fractional crystallization, fractional distillation or chromatographic methods. When G is NH or NCH3. direct ring sulfonation with pyridine sulfur trioxide complex may be preferable as known to one skilled in the art. The resulting sulfonic acid can be converted to the sulfonyl chlorides by standard methods. Alternatively. many of the sulfonyl chlorides ofFormula XIa and XIb can be prepared from compounds ofFormula XII Ia and XIIIb by the four step sequence shown in Equation 17.

The same regioselectivity in nitration is observed as described for the chlorosulfonation of XIIIa and XIIIb vide supra . The reduction of the intermediate nitro compounds to amines can be carried out by any of several methods as described in Preparative OrganicChemistry. 4th Edition. p. 557 563. John Wiley and Sons,New York and London. G. Hilgetag and A. Martini Ed.Diazotization of the amines with sodium nitrite in HC1. followed by reaction of the diazonium salt with sulfur dioxide and cupric chloride in acetic acid analogous to the teachings of Yale and Sowinski, J. Or. Chem.. 25, 1824 1960 provides the desired sulfonyl chlorides. Alternatively. the sulfonyl chlorides can be prepared by a modification of the above procedure whereby the diazotization reaction is carried out in dilute sulfuric acid and the resulting diazonium salt is reacted with sulfur dioxide. HC1 and cupric chloride in a cosolvent mixture consisting of acetic acid water 1 1 and an immiscible. inert solvent such as l chlorobutane or methylene chloride at 00 400C for 1 to 24 hours. Sulfonyl chlorides of Formula XIc and XId can also be prepared from the bromothiophenes XIIIc and XII Id by the three step sequence shown in Equation 18. Q is 0.S, CH2 or CHCH3 R1 is not SO2CH3. Br or NO2. Equation 18EMI23.1 The compounds are contacted with 1.0 equivalents of n BuLi at 780C in a solvent such as THF to give a 3 lithio species via metal halogen exchange. The lithio species is reacted with sulfur dioxide to give an intermediate sulfinate salt which precipitates and is isolated by filtration. The salt is dissolved in a solvent such as acetic acid and treated with a chlorine source such as N chlorosuccinimide to give the desired sulfonyl chloride. The bicyclic heterocycles XIII. many of which are reported in the literature, can be prepared by standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The amines of Formula III in Equations 1 and 4 are also important intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of this invention and are described below.

The amines of Formula III where X is OCF2H orCF3 or I1 is OCF2H and or Y is WCF2T wherein w is O or S and T is H. CHClF. CHBrF or CHFCF3 can be prepared by methods taught in South African PatentApplication 82 5045. or by suitable modifications that would be obvious to one skilled in the art. The pyrimidines of Formula IIIa Z CH whereY is CR5 OCH3 2.

Many of the aminoheterocyclic intermediates of Formula III where R is methyl may be prepared by a two step procedure as described for IIIg inEquation 19. X. Y and Z are as previously defined.Equation 19EMI26.1 A solution of the amine IIIa in concentrated hydrochloric acid is treated with sodium nitrite solution and the chloro compound X is isolated in the usual manner by filtration of the acidic solution. A representative procedure is described by Bee and Rose in J.Chem. Soc. C. 2031 1966 . for the case in which ZCH. and X Y OCH3. Displacement of the chlorine ofX may be accomplished by heating with an excess of methylamine in water to obtain the methylamino heterocycle IlIg . Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds ofFormula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example. metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula I with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g.. hydroxide. alkoxide. carbonate or hydride .Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cat ironic exchange can be effected by direct contacting of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound ofFormula I e.g.. alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water. e.g.. a copper salt. and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g.. an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this method. the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble. e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts. useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I with a suitable acid, e.g.. R toluenesulfonic acid.trichloroacetic acid or the like.

They include dusts. granules, pellets, solutions. suspensions.emulsions. wettable powders. emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations. broadly. contain about 0.1S to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s .More specifically. they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table VII Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions. 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can. of course. be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are some times desirable. and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins. et al., handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers . 2nd Ed.. Dorland Books. Caldwell. New Jersey. but other solids, either mined or manufac tured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are de scribed in narsden. Solvents Guide. 2nd Ed.. Interscience. New York. 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution con centrates are preferably stable against phase separa tion at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual . MC Publishing Corp.. Ridgewood, New Jersey. as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents . Chemical Publishing Co., Inc.. New York. 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of addi tives to reduce foaming. caking, corrosion. microbio logical growth. etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually. grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy sill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see. for example. Littler. U.S. Patent 3.060.084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning. Agglomeration . Chemical Engineering. December 4, 1967. pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill. New York.1973, pp. 8 57ff. In the following examples, all parts are by weight unless otherwise indicated.

They should have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks. ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots. drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Alternatively. many of the subject compounds should be useful for plant growth modification. such as growth retardation. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors.including their use as selective or general herbicides, the crop species involved. the types of weeds to be controlled. weather and climate. formulations selected. lode of application. amount of foliage present. etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 50 to 1000 g ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine. triazole, uracil. urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. Combinations with mefluidide are useful as well. The herbicidal and plant growth modifying properties of the subject compounds were discovered in the greenhouse.
