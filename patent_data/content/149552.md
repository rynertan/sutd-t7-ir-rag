# Microporous polybenzimidazole Particulates.

## Abstract
Novel microporous particles of polybenzimidazole PBI resin, characterized by a reduced bulk density, a surface area of at least 10mÂ² g, a porosity of at least about 10 , and an average pore diameter of from about 50 to 500 Angstroms are provided by emulsification precipitation or atomizing non solvent quenching techniques. The disclosed micropor ous PBI particles are particularly suitable for use as subs trates in chromatographic processes such as ion exchange, separations, purifications, etc., as well as catalysts or chemical reagents in polymer supported reactions. Micro porous PBI particles of varying acidity basicity and or anionic cationic exchange characteristics, and or containing various functional groups for use in chemical conversions, may be obtained by treatment of the PBI resin with various organic and inorganic acids, either during particle formation or subsequent thereto.
