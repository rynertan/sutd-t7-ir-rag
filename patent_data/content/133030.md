# WATER SOLUBLE COOLANT FOR FORMATION OF DRAWN AND IRONED CANS

## Abstract
The coolant comprises an aqueous solution containing 0.1 to 20 by weight of a phosphorus containing compound obtained by esterifying an epoxidation product of at least one higher unsaturated fatty acid or its ester with phosphoric acid. The ester may be derived from a monohydric or polyhydric alcohol and may be a mixture containing a glycerol ester of the fatty acid, e.g. a vegetable oil or animal fat. The coolant has a lubricating and anti corrosive effect on the can produc tion process.
