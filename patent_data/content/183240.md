# SURFACE POSITION SENSOR

## Abstract
A surface position sensor is devised which utilizes a beam of energy 80 86 reflected from a surface 40 through an optical receiver 46 to a detector 48 wherein an energy blocking member 75 having a receiver aperture 76 permits only energy substantially parallel to the optic axis 80 of the optical receiver to pass to the detector.
