# Molecular sieve type gas separation systems.

## Abstract
A molecular sieve type gas separation system 10 capable of delivering oxygen enriched air 14 by increasing the oxygen content of air 15 fed to the system has control means including a valve arrangement 16 associated with each sieve bed 11, 12, 13 for cyclically subjecting each bed to a charge adsorption on stream phase followed by a purge desorption regeneration phase. During the regeneration phase of each sieve bed the gas pressure in the bed at least substantially equals the ambient atmospheric pressure or a pressure related thereto such as the ambient pressure of an outlet to which the oxygen enriched air is being delivered and, for a predetermined range of outlet ambient pressure, the overall cycle time and the relative durations of the phases are fixed at values such that the oxygen content of air delivered by the system remains within physiologically accept able limits for breathing. In application of the system to an aircraft for supplying oxygen enriched air to aircrew, the outlet will generally comprise one or more oral nasal breathing masks and during the regener ation phase the beds are preferably opened to the ambient atmospheric pressure of the aircraft.
