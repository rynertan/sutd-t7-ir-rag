EMI2.1 There is a continuing need for safe and effective antiinflammatory agents. Inflammation is a disease process characterized by redness, fever, swelling and pain. Arthritis in its various forms, is the most prevalent, chronic, and severe of the inflammatory diseases. Traumatic injury and infection also involve inflammation, and antiinflammatory drugs are often used in their treat met. The usefulness of most commercial anti inflam..atories is limited because of toxicity and adverse side effects.Many produce gastric irritation and other effects, such as change in blood cells and central nervous system. Adrene cortical steroids produce gastric irritation and suppression of normal adrenal function.

Synthesis The compounds of this invention can be pre pared from 2,3 diarylpyrroles, methods for the preparation of which are described in European Patent 5,156 U.S. Patent Applicaticn Serial No. 10,259, filed February 8, 1979 . Reaction of 2,3 diarylpyrroles with the cyclic dimer of hexafluorothioacetone 2,2,4,4 tetrakis trifluoromethyl l,3 dithietane in the presence of phosphines, such as triphenyl phosphine, gives the products containing a hexaflucroisopropyl group ir the 5 position of the pyrrole. This reactionEMI6.1 is run in solution in an inert solvent, such as toluene or the like, usually at the boiling point of the solvent. Alternatively, the hexafluoroisopropyl group can be introduced b a three step process involving 1 introduction of a hexafluoroisopropanol group into a diaryl pyrrole,EMI7.1 2 dehydration of the alcohol to an azafulvene andEMI7.2 3 reduction of the azafulvene to the desiredEMI7.3 hexafluoroisopropyl compound. Introduction of the hexafluoroisopropanol group reaction 1 is accomplished by reaction of the 2,3 diarylpyrrole with hexafluoroacetone or its various hydrates. This reaction may be conducted in a sealed pressure reactor at a temperature from ambient to 2000C. It can also be conducted in a reflexing solvent, such as toluene, in a flask with hexafluoroacetone or its various hydrates. Acidic catalysts, such as AlCl3, BF3, p toluenesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, can be used but are not required. Reaction times are usually 4 24 hours. The use of hexafluoroacetone trihydrate in refluxing toluene without catalyst is preferred. The dehydration to the azafulvenes reaction 2 can be run with standard dehydrating agents. The preferred conditions involve heating the alcohol rn excess acetic anhydride as solvent at reflux for several hours. The reduction of the azafulvenes reaction 3 can be accomplished either by catalytic hydrogenation or by metal hydride reduction. The preferred conditions involve lithium aluminum hydride in ether at room temperature. The preparation of these compounds is further illustrated by the following examples. In the following examples, all temperatures are in degreesCentigrade. Example 1 2.3 Diphenyl 5 2,2,2 trifluoro 1 trifluoromethyl ethl lH pxtrrole. To a solution of 2.2 g 0.01 mole of 2,3 diphenyl lH pyrrole in 50 ml ether at 7E under nitrogen were added 3.64 g 0.01 mole of 2,2,4,4 tetrakis trifluoromethl 1,3 dithietane and 0.26 g 0.001 mole of triphenyl phosphine. The reaction mixture was stirred at 78 for one hour, then allowed to warm to room temperature. The tlc indicated very little reaction, so the ether solvent was removed by distillation, gradually adding toluene to replace it. The toluene solution was then heated at reflux for 1.5 hours. Then additional amounts of the dithietane 3.64 g and triphenylphosphine 0.26 g in 1 ml toluene were added and the mixture was heated at reflux overnight.The mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the residue was purified first by column chromatography on 00 g silica gel eluting with 60 40 hexane toluene then by preparative HPLC to give, after recrystallization from hexane, 0.5 g 14 of 2,3 diphenyl 5 2,2,2 tri fluoro 1 trifluoromethyl ethyl ethyl 1H pyrrole, m.p. 112 114 .

They can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The dosate administered willt of course, vary depending upon known factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration age, health, and weight of the recipient nature and extent of symptoms, kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a daily dosage of active ingredient can be about 0.05 to 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily 0.1 to 20, and preferably 0.2 to 10 milligrams per kilogram per day given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day or in sustained release form is effective to obtain desired results. Dosage forms compositions suitable for internal administration contain from about 5 milligrams to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will orginarily be present in an amount of about 0,5 95 by weight based on the total weight of the composition. The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions. It can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Gelatine capsules contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose glucose , and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions.Solutions for parenteral administration contain preferably a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid either alone or combined are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl or propyl paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described inRemington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, E.W. Martin, a standard reference text in this field. Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of formular I can be illustrated as follows Capsules A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two piece hard gelatin capsules each with 50 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 110 milligrams of lactose, 32 milligrams of talc, and 8 milligrams magnesium stearate. Capsules A mixture of active ingredient in soybean oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 50 milligrams of active ingredient. The capsules are washed in petroleum ether and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit is 50 milligrams of active ingredient, 7 milligrams of ethyl cellulose, 0,2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 7 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 11 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of cornstarch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5 by weight of active ingredient in 10 by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is made isotonic with sodium chloride and sterilized by commonly used techniques. Suspension An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 milliliters contain 100 rilligrams of finely divided active ingredient, 200 milligrams of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 milligrams of sodium benzoate, 1.0 grams of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 milliliters of vanillin. Pharmaceutical Utility A procedure for detecting and comparing the antiinflammatory activity of compounds in this series and standard drugs for which there is a gooa correlation with human efficacy is the adjuvant induced arthritis test in rats. The test procedure employed for determining antiinflammatory activity is described blow.Established Adjuvant Induced Arthritis in Rats Charles River Lewis male rats 130 150 grams are injected subcutaneously in plantar area of the right hind paw with 0.1 ml of adjuvant Difco heat killed, lyophilized Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in mineral oil 5 mg ml . 20 non arthritic controls are injected with mineral oil. The animals are held for 2 weeks to allow development of arthritis. Paw volumes uninjected, left hind paw are measured and the adjuvant injected rats are culled and distributed to treatment groups of 10 of equal disease severity. Non arthritic controls are distributed to 2 groups of 10. The rats are given oral doses of compound or PVA Acacia Polyvinyl Alcohol 1 , Gum Acacia, U.S.P. 5 , Methylparaben 0.5 10 ml kg by gavage on that day and on the 6 following days. One day after the last dose the paw volumes uninjected, left hind paw are measured using a Ugo Basile VolumeDifferential Meter Molde 7101.Arthritic Control Treatment GroupMean Paw Volume ml Mean Paw Volume ml x 100 Arthritic Control Non Arthritic ControlMean Paw Volume ml Mean Paw Volume ml Decrease from Control Mean Paw Volume. Dose response regression lines of the decrease are plotted on semi log paper by visual fit and theED50 decrease from control paw volume is determined by inspection.
