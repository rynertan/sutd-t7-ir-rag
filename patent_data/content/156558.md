# Stable fiber optic polarizer.

## Abstract
This invention relates to fiber optic apparatus and methods for polarizing light for use in fiber optic devices, such as rotation sensors. A phase grating 52 formed of alternating layers of dielectrics 54,56 having different indices of refraction is placed adjacent a half coupler 12 that includes a fiber 20,22 having a cladding thickness which forms an interaction region. The evanescent field of light of a selected polarization interacts with the phase grating 52 to couple out of the fiber 20,22 while light of a second selected polarization remains in the fiber 20,22 .
