# Clutch drive with link spring.

## Abstract
A clutch drive 10 comprising a spindle 16 on which are rotatably mounted a driving member 94 and a driven member 122 , said driving member including itself a pressure plate 96 movable axially along the spindle 16 to engage and disengage from the driven member 122 , the engagement of these elements being caused by resilient means 106 while their disengagement is effected by a piston 52 operated by compressed air. According to this invention, the resilient means include a plurality of circumferentially spaced springs 106 mounted between aligned bosses 100, 104 of the driving member 94 and pressure plate 96 , respectively, said springs 106 acting both to yieidably urge the pressure plate 96 into engagement with the driven member 122 and to transmit driving torque from the driving member 94 to the pressure plate 96 . For use particularly as fan clutch drive for a vehicle engine.
