# Use of adhesive quaternary ammonium polymer compositions in bonding flexible covering to rigid substrate, and laminated articles produced therewith.

## Abstract
An adhesive composition comprising either i a latex polymer having a Tg from 10 C to 25 C or ii a mixture of soft latex polymer and hard latex polymer, each polymer being either 1 a copolymer of quaternary monomer prepared by reacting an epihalohydrin of the formula The compositions are useful in bonding a flexible covering layer, such as fabric covered polyurethane foam, to a rigid substrate such as glass fibre mat to produce laminates including automotive headliners and acoustic panels.
