# Top drive drilling systems.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for facilitating the drilling of a well with a top drive unit having a motor which is connected to the upper end of the drill string and moves upwardly and downwardly therewith. The methods and apparatus of the invention enable the drill string 14 to be pulled upwardly off of the bottom of the well each time an additional length of drill pipe is added to the string, with the connection between that added length and the upper end of the string being made at an elevated location spaced above the rig floor 12 . In one form of the invention, an elevated platform 82 is provided on which a person may move to a location near the raised upper end of the string 14 for assisting in making the connection, with that platform 82 preferably being mounted to swing between a retracted position in which it remains during the drilling operation and an active position in which it projects to a point near the top of the string 14 during the connecting process. In another form of the invention, a back up tool 107 for preventing rotation of the upper end of the string may be controlled remotely and be removable relative to the string between an active position in which it can grip the elevated upper end of the string and a retracted position in which it remains during drilling.
