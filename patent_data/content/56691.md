# Nuclear magnetic resonance detection method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Method and Apparatus for producing an N.M.R. picture of a plane through an object by isolating the plane using an oscillating gradient and interrogating the plane using a rotating gradient and a multiplicity of R.F. pulses which are averaged over a defined period to produce an average response which is used to produce the N.M.R. picture.
