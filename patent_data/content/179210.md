# Fan clutch.

## Abstract
A fan clutch includes an input member 32 , an output member 18 , and clutch plates 28, 58 connected to the input and output members 32, 18 which are driven into drive engagement with one another when the clutch is engaged to connect the output member 18 for rotation with the input member 32 . The clutch plates 58 carried on the input member 32 are mounted on a separate clutch plate carrying member 52 , which is machined before installation on the input member 32 to thereby facilitate manufacture and assembly of the device. A fluid pressure responsive piston 90 operates the clutch plates 28, 58 , and has an outer diameter slidingly and sealingly engaged with the wall of a bore of the housing 34 of the input or driving member 32 , and its inner diameter slidingly engaged with an annular retainer 82 which is mounted for rotation with the input member 32 . A pair of roller bearings 62, 64 mount the input or driving member 32 on a fixed spindle 14 and on the output member 18 , and a bypass passage 74 is provided around the bearing 64 to assure that fluid pressure can be relieved from an oil seal 66 sealing the bore and the bearing 32 within the housing defined by the input or driving member 32 .
