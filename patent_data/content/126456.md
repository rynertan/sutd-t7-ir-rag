# Navigation apparatus for automotive.

## Abstract
A navigation apparatus mounted on a vehicle com prises a distance sensor 1 sensing the travelled distance of the vehicle, a direction sensor 2 sensing the advancing direction of the vehicle, an information storage unit 4 stor ing map data, a signal processor 3 computing the present position of the vehicle on the basis of the output signals from the distance sensor and direction sensor for displaying the computed present position of the vehicle on a color cath ode ray tube 503 together with a map read out from the in formation storage unit. In the navigation apparatus, the map data are provided by position coordinate information or font formation of division points dividing a road map into sec tions that can be linearly interpolated.
