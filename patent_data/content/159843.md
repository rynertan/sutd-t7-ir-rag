# Low detonation velocity explosive composition.

## Abstract
A liquid explosive composition having a relatively low de tonation velocity and a shock wave component that is small re lative to total energy release, containing as the explosive com ponent metriol trinitrate, diethylene glycol dinitrate or nitro glycerin and a detonation modifying ester including dibutyl and dioctyl phthalate, dioctyladipate, tricresyl phosphate, di nitrotoluene, and triacetin, as preferred.
