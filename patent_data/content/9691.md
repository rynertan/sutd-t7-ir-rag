## Description
LACQUER REMOVERThis invention relates to a removal preparation and application procedure, and it is particularly desirable as for removal of so called nail polish or nail lacquer or nail enamel from a person s fingernails or toenails.Concepts of the present invention provide, in a desirable embodiment, a lacquer remover preparation which is packaged in a dispenser, with the remover substance dispensed therefrom and applied in the form of a foam. Other forms of the remover preparation, with other types of containers and dispensing means, are also included.The concepts also provide an advantageous and desirable remover substance or mixture.Many advantages are provided by the inventive concepts.Particularly contrasting conventional or usual removal methods for removing nail polish or lacquer from fingernails, for example, the present invention overcomes or greatly reduces the messiness, bother, and other disadvantages of conventional liquid polish removers.That is, conventional nail polish remover liquid is somewhat messy to apply and use, usually being done with the aid of cotton swabs or tissues. If the liquid spills, either some drops or the whole bottle, it has a very bad and difficult to repair effect on the finish of many surfaces. Its odor is often not pleasant. The polish tends to smear onto skin regions adjacent the nail. The physiological effect o conventional removal liquid is a harsh or caustic drying effect on the user s nails and skin, causing a disadvantageous removal of natural oils from the user s skin. Conventional remover can be painful if the user has any hangnail or cut or scratch on the cuticle or other skin adjacent the nail itself. Much of the remover liquid is wasted, by either spillage or evaporation.Extra time and bother is often used, to avoid spillage and evaporation, by a succession of closure and opening procedures for the remover liquid container s cap. It is a fire hazard.The concepts of the present invention, quite in contrast, provide in a preferred embodiment a convenient ease of application and procedure, whereby a dispensing of a foamtype remover is easily done specifically onto the nail and only a small area adjacent the nail. It need be left on only several seconds, much less than a minute, and usually about only one fourth of a minute. Then a relatively simple wipe off with a tissue is usually all that is required and the nail is not only satisfactorily clean of the polish, but neither the nail nor the adjacent skin is apparently harmed in the least, and the nail has a nice odor and feel.Further, there is only a minimal danger of any spilling onto a surface which would be damaged, and there is no unpleasant odor and any fire hazard of the lacquer solvent is minimal, much less than with conventional removers.Moreover, the succession of closing and opening of a bottlecap is avoided. Further, the foam nature seems to provide a special advantage, in that as the foam bubbles break down on the user s nail, there is achieved a sort of an automaticallyachieved time delay action by which more of the solvent will be successively fed to the nail lacquer, achieving a more thorough lacquer removal per unit of solvent dispensed.In considering the nature and the many advantageous of the present invention, those factors may be possibly easier evaluated if one might look by hindsight to the disadvantageous but long standing and long unimproved prior art, particularly since the problem of nail polish removal has so long existed, without much change of procedure or nature thereof or of the removal substance itself. And after all, the acetone base removal liquids have been known for many years and also, foamy dispensate and foamdispensers have been known for many years for such things as shaving cream, depillatories, upholstery cleaners, etc.Perhaps the answer to such a hindsight inquiry is in either one or more of certain factors, or perhaps a combination of them. That is, perhaps the failure of the prior art has been just a non creativeness, a lack of the creative insight to create a substantial change in a product which has existed for scores of years in a form and nature which, after all, is of course workable and useful even though it has had the known disadvantages such as mentioned above. Or, perhaps attempts of improvement in the prior art have been toward other characteristics or other factors of the polish remover substance or procedure and the present inventive concepts, particularly with respect to the foam type embodiment, are a departure from the prior art product and from the prior art s attempted changes. According to concepts of the present invention or discovery, the polish remover in a preferred embodiment is provided as a foamy dispensate, greatly facilitating the application thereof and providing other advantages already mentioned.Several embodiments have been found to be desirable and workable, these showing percentages on a weight weight basis A preferred embodiment A Glycerin 10.10 Stearic acid 7.14 KOH 0 82 Water 18.37 Alcohol SDA 40 15.31 Acetone 30.82 Ethyl acetate 17.35The percentages throughout do not count in other substances which may or may be present, such as propellant, fragrance, etc Certain things should be noted as to this embodiment, as well as to the others. Very little KOH is required.Although it is expected to form a salt with stearic acid, that is, potassium stearate a soap its general effect is that of a catalyst. Thus the KOH and stearic acid create a foaming means or agent. Also, the water and the alcohol serve generally the same purpose of a carrier, although the alcohol has an extra effect of its higher volatility hastening a drying process, and the alcohol is a mutual solvent to the propellant and the foaming agent and the emollient. Thus if one of these ingredients is increased, the other may be correspondingly decreased, except that some alcohol is desirably included to provide its special properties noted above. Similarly, the acetone gnd the ethyl acetate both serve a solvent function however, other solvents such as other ketones e.g., methyl isobutyl ketone, MIBK or other acetates may be used.Thus one may be increased, with a corresponding decrease of the other. The glycerin is an emollient or conditioner and the other emollients such as lanolin, peanut oil, etc. may be used instead of, or with, the glycerin shown above.Also, in dispensers for foamy dispensate application, desirably the above mixture of concentrate is provided as 90 , the other 10 being a propellant known as A 46, containing about 87 iso butane and about 13 propane.Further, it is to be noted that whatever foaming agent is used, it must be compatible with the solvent and preferably, just enough foaming agent is used to get the substance to foam, because of extra cost of certain foaming agents and because it is desired that the foam break down rapidly to achieve a fast contacting of the solvent with all of the area having polish or lacquer to be removed. Although this foaming agent of this embodiment is the stearic acid and KNOB, it is believed that others of the prior art would be also operable, such as metallic salts of fatty acids e.g., calcium stearate , salts of complex organic phosphorus esters e.g., GAFAC LO 529 and GAFAMIDE CDD 518, sold by General Analine and Film Corp., 140 W. 51st Street,New York, N.Y. 10020 , sulfates, sulfonates, metallic and non metallic salts, and others known to the prior art. As a comment generally applicable to any embodiment in which acetone is mentioned as a solvent, other ketones or solvents e.g., methyl ethyl ketone, methyl iso buthyl Acetone, methyl acetate, iso propyl acetate, butyl acetate may be used as an alternative to the acetone.As shown in this embodiment, the solvent preferably in cludes an ester the ethyl acetate listed is an ester providing a reduced flammability and more desirable scent in comparison to acetone itself, and also serves as an emollient or conditioner.If such alternatives are used, probably an increase of the stearic acid and the KOH will be desirable, depending upon what is needed to reate the desired foam characteristics in consideration of the particular solvent alternative used.Also as applicable to the various embodiments, whereas here the carrier is shown as water and alcohol, other carriers can presumably be used such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and or fatty alcohols e.g., cetyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol .The glycerin serves as a skin conditioner and emollient.Other emollients could be used, such as lanolin, mineral oil, fatty esters, and glycols. Polyhydric alcohols e.g., sorbitol, fatty esters, and fatty acid amino tor amino betaine derivatives illustrate other. conditioners which could be used.Continuing the comments generally applicable to all the embodiments, it should be noted that there seems to be no close range or limits as to the various ingredients. That is, for exemple, in this Embodiment A , the ranges can probably be at least as wide as follows, particularly also recalling the above comments concerning corresponding increases and decreased of certain ingredients Glycerin about 1 to 12 Stearic acid about 5 to 8 KOH about 0.5 to 1.5 Water about 0 to 25 Alcohol DA 40 about 1 to 20 Acetone about 0 to 50 Ethyl acetate about 0 to 50 Embodiment B This, and subsequent embodiments, are stated with actual proportions weight weight , as well as overall ranges bearing in mind the above comments as to overall ranges Actual Range Glycerin 10 about 1 to 12 Stearic acid 7 about 5 to 8 KOH 0.8 about 0.5 to 1.5 Water 20 about 0 to 25 Alcohol SDA 40 15 about 1 to 20 Acetone 47.2 about 40 60 60 As before, the above concentrate that is, the composition which includes the substances just listed is desirably about 90 weight weight of a foam dispensable mixture in which the propellant is a foaming agent, such as formed of 87 iso butane and 13 propane.Embodiment C In the remaining embodiments, for brevity as before the actual proportion is given, with the ranges given also in the same listing Actual Range Ethyl acetate 41.24 about 0 to 45 Methyl Cellosolve 13.40 about 0 to 35 IPA , 10.31 about 5 to 15 .

Type 941 m.w. 1,000,000 Type 934 m.w. 3,000,000 .Thus, TEA Carbopol 941 0.2 by weight refers to an aqueous solution of Carbopol 941, partially neutralized by TEA, which was added in approximately the same molecular weight ratio as that of the Carbopol itself. It serves as a surface active agent surfactant , a carrier, and as an emollient. The calcium stearate is a soap, and that herein used was called Petrac 1255, of Petrochemicals, Inc., Ft. Worth,Texas. It serves as a foaming agent and a surfactant. Embodiment 1,F Another embodiment, which has a low odor and is an effective polish remover, although desirably dispensed in a form of liquid or spray, or a gel, in contrast to a foam, is as follows Acetone 25 Methyl ethyl ketone 50Z Water 20 Carbopol 934 . less than 1Z GAFAC RE 610 .2.5 GAFAMIDE CDD 518 2.5 Perfume may be added if desired, in. this as well as other embodiments. If this is desired as a gel or paste, the Carbopol 934 should be increased to about 1 , and neutralized with a neutralizing agent such as TEA.The acetone and the methyl ethyl ketone proportions, they both being solvents, may be varied correspondingly as desired, although a larger proportion of the methyl ethyl ketone is desired ro raise the flash point and thus minimize the fire hazard.The Carbopol 934 .is a water soluble resin generally similar to the TEA Carbopol 941 mentioned above but with a higher molecular weight.As to the GAFAC RE 610 and the GAFAMIDE CDD 518 The GAFACRE 610 is a complex organic phosphate ester an anionic surfactant sold by General Analine and Film Corp., 140 W.51st Street, New York, NY 10020. The GAFAMIDE CDD 518 a non ionic surfactant is a coconut oil diethanolamine condensate, CTFA name cocamide DEA, sold by the same company. Being surfactants, these are foaming agents.The propellant of this as a spray dispensate is desirably a hydrocarbon propellant, such as A 46 formed of 87 isobutane and 13 propane.Embodiments G, H, and I Liquid forms, such as for pump type dispensers or selfpressurized dispensers or other liquid application procedures, including not only liquid as such but sprays or foams or gels or pastes, have been discovered as follows Embod.

Advantages of these forms include a reduction of the fire hazard, reduction of the toxicity, and reduction of odor, yet they still maintain effectiveness of the polish remover characteristics.Either the methyl Cellosolve1, ingredient or the ethyl acetate may be used wholly or partially in place of the other in these embodiments, both being solvents and this is the difference indicated between embodiments G, H, and I . Other variations in their relative proportions are assumed also to be workable and useful in a formulation for this purpose.The calcium stearate, the coco amino betaine, and the sorbitan ingredients may be varied, presumably as high as about 5 for any of them, leaving out the others partially or wholly so that the total weight proportion of all three would be only about 5 . They serve as foam agents, are surfactants, and also act as emulsifiers and lubricants.Adjustments as to concentration vary according to the desired means of dispensing, i.e., as a spray or foam or liquid or gel.The coco amino betaine used was Lonzaine 12 C, 32 active material, as sold by Lonza, Inc , No. 22 10 Route 208,Fair Lawn, N.J., 07410. This material is an amphoteric surfactant. It promotes foam properties. The POE refers to polyoxyethylene it is reacted with sorbitan monostearate, and forms a non ionic surfactant that functions as a solubilizing agent for the perfume addition. The form used was that of Tween 60 , which is a material sold under that trademark by ICI United States, its Atlas Chemicals Div., New Murphy Road and Concord Pike,Wilmington, Delaware, 19897.The carboxy polymethylene TEA Carbopol 934 used was 0.2 by weight water solution which was neutralized by the TEA reagent. As a triethanolamine salt gel it functions as a thickener, stabilizer, and flow control agent and it is an anionic surfactant. Probably, up to a 20 upper limit, the amount of this ingredient may be. raised if increase in thickness of suspension is desired, this depending upon what propellant, if any, is to be used. Conversely, if less viscosity is desired, less of this reagent should be used, even none at all if the composition is to be dispensed in free flowing liquid form.The fragrance reagent used was that of Lemon No. 498585 sold by Universal Flavor and Fragrance Co., 5650 W. RaymondStreet, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46241, which is a special lemon fragrance which effectively masks the odor of the ethylacetate.As to the N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, it advantageously raises the flash point, reducing volatility in contrast to that of ethyl acetate, yet it serves as a solvent for the polish or lacquer material being removed. Having properties of a solvent, it may be used in the other embodiments also, It is thus seen that a lacquer remover preparation, particularly in a foam type application, according to the present inventive concepts, provides a desired and advantageous substance for the removal of lacquer or nail polish, or nail enamel, achieving many advantages such as ease, convenience, and handiness, and other advantages of less harm to the person s nails and skin, less hazard from spillage and surface marring, less fire hazard, improved odor, less loss by spillage or evaporation, etc.Even without the foam nature of the preparation, most of these advantages are still present.Accordingly, it will thus be seen from the foregoing description of the invention according to these illustrative embodiments, that the present invention or discovery provides new and useful concepts of lacquer removal preparation and procedure, yielding desired advantages and characteristics, and thus accomplishing the intended objects, including those hereinbefore pointed o t and others which are inherent in the invention.Modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of the invention accordingly, the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments or forms or formulations herein described or shown.For example, the inventive concepts include herein embodiments for polish removal substances whic h are not in the form of a foam even though the foam nature seems to provide special advantages. Thus, for example, the composition shown for Embodiment F was noted as preferably in a form of a liquid or spray or gel in contrast to a foam. The other embodiments. F through I may be modified as desired with respect to form for example, they may be provided with additional foaming agents, and with a propellant or other pressure systems. Perfume or other fragrances may be incorporated as desired. Further, ingredients of one embodiment may be utilized in other embodiments also, to the e xtent that they perform their desired function, i.e., solvents for solvents, foams for foams, emollients for emollients, etc. Although the utilization is herein mentioned primarily as that for removal of nail polish or lacquer, the inventive concepts include the use of these compositions for whatever purpose may be achieved, particularly removal of other lacquer coatings. Thus, as used herein, the term nail polish is used to indicate also whatever is the lacquer or enamel which is to be removed by the preparation.
