# Baffle plate for a heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A baffle plate 28 , for supporting tubes 16 in a heat ex changer shell 12 , comprises a sheet of non metallic mate rial formed with a plurality of closely spaced cylindrical holes through which the tubes pass. The sheet material is such that it swells upon contact with oil, which is passed through the shell and around the tubes, to grip the tubes.
