# Self shift type gas discharge panel.

## Abstract
In order to prevent abnormal wall charge accumulation, and thereby to prevent accidental erroneous discharges resulting from such abnormal accumulation, paths for leak age of wall charges accumulated on dielectric layers 3 are provided in dielectric layers 3 corresponding to a write elec trode W1 at one end of a shift channel and a final shift elec trode y2n at the other end of the shift channel. A path for leakage of wall charges may be provided by a crevice 11 in the dielectric layer 3 which extends from the surface of the dielectric layer 3 to the surface of the write electrode W1 or the surface of the final shift electrode y2n. Other means of providing such a leakage path are also disclosed.
