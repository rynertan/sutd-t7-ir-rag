# Radiation image recording system.

## Abstract
In a radiation image recording system in which a radiation image is recorded on a stimulable phosphor sheet 2 and then read out and reproduced into a visible radiation image, a high power light source 20 is built in the system to erase the noise due to the previously stored radiation image and the fog in the phosphor sheet by a single erasing operation immediately before the phosphor sheet is to be used to record thereon a radiation image. The light source 20 has an exposure amount of at least 500,000 1x sec. and is positioned between a phosphor sheet feeding section 3 and a section 10 where a radiation image is recorded on the sheet. The system is also provided with a mechanism 14 for sending the phosphor sheet from the recording section to a sheet receiver 5 or radiation image read out and reproduc ing apparatus.
