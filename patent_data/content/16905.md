# Continuous casting method and apparatus for structurally defined metallic strips.

## Abstract
Structurally defined continuous metal strips are formed by forcing molten metal 2 onto the surface 1 of a moving chill body 7 under pressure through a slotted 10 nozzle lo cated in close proximity to the surface of the chill body. The surface 1 of the chill body chill surface whereon casting of the strips takes place has a contoured surface, i.e. it is pro vided with structurally defined protuberances and or indenta tions, which are faithfully replicated by the formed strip, the thickness of the strip being substantially uniform throughout, regardless of whether it replicates a level area of the chill sur face or a raised or indented area.
