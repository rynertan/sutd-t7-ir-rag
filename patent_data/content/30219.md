# A frequency matched signal device for persons with impaired hearing.

## Abstract
A frequency matched signal device for persons with impaired hearing, including an activating member 1,2,3 , a signal generator 4 activated thereby for producing an elec trical signal with a fundamental frequency which is within the range of audibility of a person having a normal sense of hearing, and an amplifier 16 having a loudspeaker 6 con nected after it for amplifying the signal into an acoustic signal. A first device P1 permits an optional setting of the fundamental frequency of the signal generator a second device P3, R1 13,14,15 permits an optional setting of the signal generator so that it will deliver at least one additional electrical signal of at least one second frequency which is optionally adjustable and related to the fundamental fre quency. The additional second signal or signals, respec tively, is are amplified in the amplifier and an alternator 8 which is connected to the signal generator causes the electri cal output signal of the signal generator to alternate between said frequencies at a predetermined slow rate.
