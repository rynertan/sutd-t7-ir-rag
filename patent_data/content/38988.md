# Organic peroxide compositions.

## Abstract
A solid organic peroxide composition comprises from 50 to below 70 by weight of a solid organic peroxide, such as benzoyl peroxide, at least 10 preferably at least 15 of a liquid desensitiser such as a liquid ester of phthalic acid, benzoic acid or phosphoric acid, a silicone oil or a liquid chlorinated hydrocarbon and a solid organophilic compound such as a solid ester of phthalic acid, benzoic acid or phos phoric acid a solid chlorinated hydrocarbon or a salt of a higher fatty acid in, preferably, less than 20 by weight. The compositions are particularly insensitive to impact.
