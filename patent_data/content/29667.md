# Gas lubricated bearings and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A hydrodynamic gas lubricated bearing comprises a rotor 1 with a smooth bearing surface 3 , and a fixed bear ing plate 2 with a grooved surface 4 . The grooves 10 are of spiral configuration being separated by lands 13 the top surface 14 of each of which has a convex profile. The cen tral portion 15 of the surface 14 is raised above the edges 17 so that wedge shaped regions 18 are formed between the surface 3 of the rotor 1 on both sides of the central portion 15 . The surface 4 of the fixed bearing plate 2 may be formed with an overall convex surface. The grooved sur face 4 of the fixed bearing member 2 is made by forming a pattern of grooves 10 in a smooth blank and subsequently rounding off the top surface 14 of the lands 13 by rotating the bearing part under pressure against a soft abrasive cloth.
