# Copolymeric nucleating agent for polyester.

## Abstract
Novel nucleating agents have been discovered which are effective in polyesters, especially poly ethylene terephtha late . The novel nucleating agents are copolymers derived from a poly alkylene terephthalate and a sulfonate salt. Also provided by this invention are a process for nucleat ing polyesters, particularly poly alkylene terephthalates , especially poly ethylene terephthalate and the compositions so produced.
