# Fiber optic connector.

## Abstract
A fiber optic connector is disclosed for optically coupling a pair of fiber optic cables 12 or a single fiber optic cable and a light source or detector. A terminal member includes a pair or identical matching halves 20a,b defining a through hole extending axially therethrough. The through hole has a first portion 44 extending through a mating end of the terminal member and sized to snugly receive a length 14 of the fiber core stripped of the outer coating and properly positioning the core with respect to the mating end of the terminal member. The through hole has a second portion 46 extending through a rear end of the terminal member and sized for receiving the outer coating 16 of the fiber optic cable. Projections are formed in the second portion of the through hole for clamping the outer coating to prevent lengthwise movement of the fiber optic cable 12 relative to the terminal member. A ferrule member 22 is positionable over the rear end 68 of the terminal member for biasing the projections into clamping engagement with the outer coat ing of the fiber optic cable.
