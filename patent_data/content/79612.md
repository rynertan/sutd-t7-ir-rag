# Earth station transmission power control system.

## Abstract
In an earth station 11 , an amplifier 15 amplifies a pilot information signal with a variable gain. An up link pilot is thereby transmitted with a controllable transmission power. A beacon receiver 28 detects a level or C N with which a beacon signal emitted by a satellite reaches the station 11 . A pilot receiver 33 detects a level or C N for a down link pilot radiated by the satellite in response to the up link pilot. A controller 37 controls the gain to keep a ratio between the levels or C N s constant. Up link signals transmitted with the power so controlled, are radiated by the satellite as down link signals with a substantially constant EIRP despite an attenua tion which might be caused to the up link signals by rain or mist.
