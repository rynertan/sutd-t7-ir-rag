## Description
2,2,6, 6 TET AMETHYL 4 PIPE IDYL SUBSTITUTED HETEROCYCLIC RING COMPOUNDS, A METHOD FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND POLYMERS CONTAINING THE SAME This invention relates to 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4piperidyl substituted heterocyclic ring compounds and to a method for their preparation and to stabilised polymer compositions containing such compounds. The invention relates to a method for the stabilisation of polymers wherein the said 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl substituted heterocyclic ring compounds are admixed to the polymer. That synthetic, and even many natural, organic polymers require stabilisation against the action of light, particularly ultraviolet light, and heat induced discoloration and deterioration of physical properties is well known. Organic polymers subjected to outdoor exposure often discolor and show a loss of physical properties as a result of the exposure to a number of degradation inducing factors e.g. ultraviolet light, heat, water and oxygen . Outdoor use of organic polymers not only subjects the polymers to the action of the ultraviolet light of the sun but also the heat of the sun. This outdoor exposure to ultraviolet light and heat takes place in the presence of oxygen in the air. Thus, there can exist various combinations of factors working to degrade the organic polymer.On the other hand there exist other uses of organic polymers which result in their exposure to heat and oxygen in the absence of ultraviolet light, or ultraviolet light and oxygen in the absence of heat or even heat in the absence of oxygen. Thus, many organic polymers require protections against deterioration inauced by a variety of environmental conditions. Factors uch as heat and oxygen are not only present during the commercial use of organic polymers but are also present during the processing of the polymer into finished articles of commerce. Stabilisation of organic polymers against discoloration and loss of physical properties during processing into finished products is also required. ln view of the numerous applications and large scale use of organic polymers, it is very important to stabilise such organic polymers against the deteriorating effects of environmental factors during processing and use. To protect many organic polymers against undesirable changes in physical properties and discolouration during processing and use, various stabilisers and stabiliser mixtures have been added to the organic polymers. Included among such stabilizers are, for example, the well known metal salts, organometallic compounds, phenols, hindered phenols, substituted and un substituted benzophenones, salicylates, mercaptans, expoxides and benzothiazoles. More recently hindered amine stabilisers having tetraalkyl substituted piperidino groups have been proposed as stabilisers.Although a large number of stabiliser compounds and stabiliser combinations, including the hindered amine type of stabilisers have been proposed and some of them used, there continues the search for better stabilisers to overcome the deficiencies of known stabilisers. Among these deficiencies there are, for example, included low stabilising efficiency, high cost, stabiliser instability, initial coloration of the polymer, volatility and odour. ore effective, stable, easy to use and lower cost stabilisers are always sought. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl substituted heterocyclic ring compound. Another object is to provide as a highl effective stabiliser for organic polymers a 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl substituted heterocyclic ring compound.A further object is to provide highly stable organic polymer compositions comprising an organic polymer and a 2,2,6,6tetramethyl 4 piperidyl substituted heterocyclic ring compound.A further object is to provide a method for preparing the 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl substituted heterocyclic ring compounds of this invention. In accordance with this invention there is provided 1 a compound having one or two bis 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4piperidyl substituted heterocyclic rings in which said heterocyclic ring has five ring atoms, two of said ring atoms being non adjacent nitrogen atoms whilst three are carbon atoms there being a 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl 4 piperidyl group bonded to each nitrogen atom of the heterocyclic ring which compound is hereinafter called the hindered amine compound and 2 a stabilised polymer composition comprising an organic polymer normally susceptible to light and or heat induced degradation together with the above described hindered amine compound according to this invention.Further, this invention contemplates a method of stabilizing an organic polymer normally susceptible to light and or heat induced degradation comprising the addition to said polymer of the above described hindered amine compound as well as a method for preparing the above described hindered amine compound comprising reacting a compound having the following general formulaEMI3.1 with an aldehyde having the general formulaEMI3.2 and, if desired, reacting the resulting product with a halide having the general formula R4Y wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, R4 is C1 to C4 alkyl, C7 to C18 aralkyl or C2 to C8 alkenyl, R5 is a straight or branched aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group having a valence equal to n, n is 1 or 2 and Y is a halogen atom. There has now been discovered a hindered amine compound, as described herein, which can be used to stabilise organic polymers against light and or heat induced degradation without many of the disadvantages of the prior art compounds used for the same purpose. The hindered amine compounds described herein in accordance with this invention have low volatility, are essentially non migrating in an organic polymer and are readily compatible with organic polymers.Low volatility is an important feature especially during the incorporation of the stabiliser compound into the organic polymer and subsequent processing of the organic polymer into finished articles o commerce. Such low volatility reduces or prevents significant odours and contamination of the work place atmosphere as well as reducing or preventing undesirable losses through volatilisation of the stabiliser compound during processing. The non migrating feature is advantageous for obtaining uniform distribution of the stabiliser throughout the organic polymer. High compatibility of the stabiliser with the polymer improves the mixing of the stabiliser into the polymer to achieve a uniform distribution of the stabiliser in the polymer. In addition to being useful as a stabiliser for organic polymers, it is contempled that the hindered amine compound according to this invention may have such other uses as an insecticide, a fungicide, an anticorrosion agent, a bacteriocide and an antiviral agent.
