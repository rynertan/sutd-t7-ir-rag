# Improvements in or relating to methods of and or apparatus for punching holes in sheet metal.

## Abstract
A machine for punching holes 21 in sheet metal 10 has a punch roller 3 carrying a plurality of punches 4 and a back up roller 6 having a groove therein which has a bottom 14 at a predetermined depth in the back up rol ler 6 . Its method of use is to run sheet metal 10 through the nip between the two rollers 3 and 6 so that the punches 4 punch out slugs 12 of metal so that a point 13 on each slug 12 bears against the bottom 14 of the groove which acts as a pivot point 13 on which the slug 12 pivots to cause the slug 12 to be completely freed from the parent metal 10 by the further action of the punch 4 .
