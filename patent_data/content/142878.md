# Electrochemical cell comprising stable hydride forming material.

## Abstract
An electrochemical cell having a negative electrode comprising a compound derived from LaNiâ‚…, in which La is optionally substituted by a plateau pressure increasing ele ment and in which Ni is substituted entirely or partly by a plateau pressure reducing element, for example, Co and or Cu, with the object of considerably reducing volume steps and hence crack formation of the intermetallic compound during charging and discharging. Moreover, the corrosion of the intermetallic compound is counteracted by adding small quantities of Al, Cr and or Si, which metals enhance the formation of a protecting oxide layer.
