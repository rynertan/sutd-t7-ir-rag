# Method and apparatus for transporting a recording medium with an adaptive velocity change profile.

## Abstract
An adaptive velocity change profile for control of a video tape transport apparatus during a cue mode. The tape transport apparatus moves the video tape to a cue point in the shortest time available by adapting a deceleration velocity change profile to the actual ballistics of transport of the tape. The deceleration velocity change profile is opti mized as according to the distance separating the selected frame location the cue point and the measured ballistics of transport of the tape. The measured ballistics of transport of tape varies according to variances in inertial loading repre sented by transport.
