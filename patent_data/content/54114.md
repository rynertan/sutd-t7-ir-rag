# Liquid droplet forming apparatus.

## Abstract
Described is a dual cavity multinozzle drop generator adaptable for use in an ink jet printer. The drop generator includes a first housing member 12 with an inner cavity 14 . The cavity converges to one side of the housing member. A cylindrical vibrating assembly 30, 34 is posi tioned within the cavity. The configuration is such that an annular cavity 36 is formed between the outer surface of the vibrating assembly and the inner surface of the housing member. A second housing member 44 having a converging ink cavity 38 therein is coupled to the first housing member. The arrangement is such that the ink cavity is in linear alignment with the inner cavity. A relatively stiff membrane 40 is disposed between the inner cavity 36 and the ink cavity 38 . The inner cavity 36 is filled with an acoustical rubber material. A nozzle plate 43 , having a plurality of spaced linear apertures, is mounted onto the second housing member so that the apertures are in liquid communication with the ink cavity.
