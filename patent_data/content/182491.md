## Description
This invention relates to new azulene derivatives and to anti hypercholesterolemic agents containing the same. The azulene derivatives of this invention appear to be novel per se, but in addition there does not appear to be any suggestion in the prior art of compounds with an azulene nucleus having an anti hypercholesterolemic effect. DE B 1059447 Hafner describes azulene hydrocarbons structurally different to those claimed in the present invention and it makes no disclosure regarding pharmaceutical use of these compounds. Hyperlipemia, especially hypercholesterolamia, is known to be a cause for arteriosclerosis and related diseases, and there has been a demand for the development of better agents and new compounds that can be used as active ingredients in the same. We have succeeded in synthesizing new azulene derivatives representated by the following general formula and found that these compounds show no side effects and can be used as active ingredients in anti hypercholesterolemic agents. In the formula given above, R¹ and R² are the same or different, and are selected from hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms e.g. methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t butyl and n pentyl , or alkenyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms e.g. vinyl, allyl, isopropenyl and isopentenyl . R¹ and CHO groups may be present in any different positions on the five membered ring 1 , 2 and 3 , positions , and R² may be attached to any position on the seven membered ring 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 positions . The azulene derivatives of this invention can be prepared, for example, by the reaction shown below wherein R¹ and R² are as defined above . The introduction of formyl into the five membered ring may be effected by the Vilsmeier reaction for example, reaction with dimethylformamide and phosphorus oxychloride . The azulene derivatives of this invention can be isolated from the reaction mixture by removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, followed by purification by column chromatography on alumina. The azulene derivatives of this invention are effective in preventing and treating hyperlipemia of humans and mammals, and may be administered orally in the form of tablets, capsules or elixirs, or parenterally in the form of solutions or suspensions. The total daily dose of the azulene derivative is in the range from 1 mg to 2000 mg 0.2 to 500 mg several times a day . The optimum dose may vary with the severity of disease, weight of patient and other factors known to those skilled in the art. When used as an anti hypercholesterolemic agent, an azulene derivative of this invention about 0.2 to 500 mg is shaped, together with physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, antiblocking agent, preservative, stabilizer, flavouring or other additives, into unit dosage form. Typical examples of additives that can be used in tablets and capsules are binders such as gum traganth, gum arabic, corn starch and gelatin excipients such as micro crystalline cellulose swelling agents such as corn starch, pregelatinized starch and alginic acid lubricants such as magnesium stearate sweeteners such as sucrose, lactose and aspartame and perfumes such as peppermint. Other additives include edible oil as liquid carrier in capsules shellac, sugar and a combination thereof tablet coating . Parenteral injections may employ, as a vehicle to dissolve or suspend the active ingredient, water, natural vegetable oils such as sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil and cottonseed oil, and synthetic oils such as ethyl oleate, and may also contain buffering agents, preservatives and anti oxidants as required. The following Examples will further illustrate this invention. An ice cooled solution 15 ml of 2.32 g phosphorus oxychloride in dimethylformamide was added dropwise to a solution 15 ml of 1.5 g 1 ethyl 5 isopropylazulene in dimethylformamide. Stirring under ice cooling was continued for seven hours, and the reaction mixture was poured into about 200 ml of ice water for decomposition. After adjusting the pH to 10 with a caustic soda solution, the mixture was thoroughly extracted with benzene. Distilling off the solvent from the benzene extract gave 1.6 g of crude 3 ethyl 7 isopropylazulene 1 aldehyde yield 95 , which was recrystallized from n hexane, affording the pure product melting at 60 to 62 C. Table 1 lists the properties of this and other azulene derivatives prepared in a similar way. ICR male mice 21 days old were fed on a commercial diet for two days, and then supplied with an experimental diet containing 1 cholesterol for seven days. The composition of the experimental diet used in this test is as follows The substances listed in Table 2 1 were orally administered forcibly to each mouse by means of a gastric catheter on the sixth and seventh days from the start of feeding on the experimental diet. Test animals were grouped prior to the first administration on the sixth day each group consisting of 10 rats, with each member weighing 21.2 1.2 g on average . After the second administration on the seventh day, the animals were made to fast for 16 hours, blood samples were taken under ether, the plasma was obtained by the usual method, and the total cholesterol was determined by Hitachi Model 706D Automatic Analyzer. The growth data and cholesterol measurements are summarized in Table 2 2 the enzymic method was used for cholesterol measurement . The total cholesterol was substantially reduced by administration of the azulene derivatives of this invention, while no significant difference was observed in the gain of body weight, nor any detectable abnormality upon dissection. SD male rats 28 days old were used for this test. The animals were housed individually with free access to diet and water. Each rat was fed on a commercial diet for two days, and then supplied with an experimental feed containing 0.7 cholesterol for seven days. The composition of the experimental feed used in this test is as follows The substances listed in Table 3 1 were orally administered forcibly to each rat by means of a gastric catheter on the sixth and seventh days from the start of feeding on the experimental diet. Test animals were grouped prior to the first administration on the sixth day each group consisting of 6 rats, with each member weighing 122.4 6.0 g on average . After the second administration on the seventh day, the animals were made to fast for 16 hours, and the total serum cholesterol was determined in the same manner as in 1 above. The result is summarized in Table 3 2. The total cholesterol was markedly reduced with increasing dose of the azulene derivatives of this invention, while no significant difference was observed in the gain of body weight. Fatty livers, which were observed in the control group, were found to have been relieved in the 400 mg Kg test group. The result is shown in Table 3 2. The components listed above were intimately mixed, the mixture was passed through a 60 mesh screen, and the fine powder thus obtained was charged in gelatin capsules 200 mg per capsule .
