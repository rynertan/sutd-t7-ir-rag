# Refrigerant gas injection system for refrigeration cycle having a screw compressor.

## Abstract
A refrigerant gas injection system for a refrigeration cycle of the type having a screw compressor provided with a slide valve 16 for controlling the compression capacity of the screw compressor, an economizer 8 disposed in a passage 6a for re frigerant liquid and adapted for subcooling the refrigerant liq uid by the refrigerant of a reduced pressure, and a refrigerant gas injection line 11 through which the refrigerant gas gen erated in the economizer 8 is injected into the compression chamber of the screw compressor in its compression phase. The refrigerant gas injection system has a gas injection con trolling means 25, 26 adapted for enabling the injection of the refrigerant gas when the screw compressor is operating at full 100 capacity or load level and to prevent the injection of the refrigerant gas when the screw compressor is operating in un loaded state.
