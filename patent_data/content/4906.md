# Method and apparatus for measuring the weight of a moving object, in particular of a gob of molten glass.

## Abstract
The gob 10 is directed along a curved channel 12 having a force measuring device 14 over which the gob 10 passes for measuring the force exerted by the gob 10 normal to its path. The velocity of the gob 10 is determined both before and after the normal force is measured by means of two sets of two position sensors P1, P2 and P3, P4 , one set located on each side of the force measuring device 14 , and a timer which determines the time period for the gob 10 to move between the position sensors P1, P2 and P3, P4 of each set. The timer also determines the time between velocity measurements. The date is used to calculate a value of acceleration which is substantially proportional to the acceleration normal to the path. The acceleration value and the output of the force measuring device 14 are then interrelated in order to calculate the mass of the gob 10 .
