# Indication system for a four wheel drive vehicle.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine comprises a transmis sion for transmitting a power from the engine to two main driving wheels, a clutch for selectively transmitting the power to another two wheels, a selection lever for engaging said clutch, compares the speeds of the two pairs of wheels and gives a signal when the wheel slippage occurs, to warn the driver that four wheel drive should be engaged. The indication system comprises speed detectors 23, 27, 28 and 22, 29, 30 which detects the speeds of the main driving wheels and the other two wheels. An electric circuit 32 38 compares the speeds and illuminates a warning lamp 18 when the difference between the speeds exceeds a pre determined level, whereby slippage of the main driving two wheel is detected.
