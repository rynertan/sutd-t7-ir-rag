# Framing assembly for a multi passenger seating unit.

## Abstract
An improved framing system for a multi passenger seat incorporates a generally inverted L shaped rear leg 26 whose shorter leg portion is joined to a rear stretcher tube 20 at its free end and to a compression member 28 at its point of intersection with its longer leg portion. The com pression member 28 and short leg portion form one side of a triangle which includes the front leg 24 and a support member 22 connecting the front 18 and rear 20 stretcher tubes. The longer leg portion forms one leg of a triangle which includes the compression member 28 and a seat track covering member 30 . The design provides greatly improved passenger leg room for close pitch seating arrangements.
