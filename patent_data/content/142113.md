# ACTIVE MATERIAL FOR BATTERIES

## Abstract
An active material for batteries comprising a fiuorinated carbon obtained by reacting a carbon black having a specific surface area of not less than 100 mÂ² g. The active material is excellent in discharge characteristics, particularly in flatness of discharge voltage, in height of discharge voltage and in discharge level at initial stage.
