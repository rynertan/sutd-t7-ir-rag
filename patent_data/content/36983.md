# Analyzer for measuring laser pulse characteristics.

## Abstract
Apparatus, including a detector array, analog to digital converter, a microprocessor including a memory, and dis play for determining the total energy, divergence and position of an applied laser beam from a single laser pulse. The detector array is coupled to the microprocessor and computer memory by way of the analog to digital converter. The microprocessor controls the detector array scanning and computes the values for the desired characteristics. The display provides for a numerical, alpha numerical or printed record of the calculated values. A method of determining the total energy, relative position and divergence is also pro vided.
