# System for the control and regulation of electrodes in the electro slag remelting process.

## Abstract
The system for the control and regulation of electrodes immersion depth in an ESR process according to the pre sent invention, is suitable for the case in which two elec trodes 4, 5 are connected in series to a power source 3 and each of the electrodes has an independent feed mechanism. The present invention is based on the assumption that the slag used in the ESR process has a composition which does not vary during the process, thus also enabling to assume that two equal lengths of slag have equal electrical resistance. Hence the slag comprised between the elec trodes tips and the molten metal bath can be considered as two variable resistances which are equal only when the electrodes tips are at the same distance from the molten metal bath. Thus said two variable resistances can be used in a sort of electrical bridge, which can be suitably balanced. Should an electrode be consumed more rapidly than the other, the thickness of the slag, as well as its electrical resistance, existing between the electrode tip and the molten metal will increase, thus unbalancing the bridge. The amplitude and direction of this unbalancement will tell both which elec trode is consumed more rapidly and to which rate, thus enabling the operator, or an automatic device, to correct the feed rate of the electrode.
