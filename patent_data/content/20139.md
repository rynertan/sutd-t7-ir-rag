The conveyor comprises a series of carriages 34 movable along an endless path. Each carriage 34 has a pair of tongs 36a, 36b which are movable between closed and open positions to grip and release a confection. The closed positions of the tongs are adjusted by an adjustable stop assembly 278 which co operates with a deflector 304 mounted in a stationary position and which adjusts the closed positions of the tongs as the carriages 34 move past the deflector 304 . The deflector 304 can be moved to readjust the stop portions of all the carriages 34 .
