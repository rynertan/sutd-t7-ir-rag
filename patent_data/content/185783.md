## Description
IMPROVED EMI SHIELDING EFFECTIVENESS OF THERMOPLASTICS Nan I Liu 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is concerned with conductive thermoplastic compositions having improved surface conductivity and improved electromagnetic radio frequency interference EMI RFI shielding effectiveness at high frequencies. These improved properties are obtained by the incorporation of conductive carbon powder in conductive thermoplastic compositions, wherein said conductive thermoplastic composition comprises a thermoplastic polymer having incorporated therein a synergistic Ã§ombination of metal flake and one or more conductive fibers, preferably metal or metal coated fibers. Electronic equipment, particularly sensitive electronic equipment such as computers, business machines, communications equipment and the like are all susceptible to malfunction as a result of EMI RFI.Furthermore, in addition to being sensitive to foreignEMI RFI, many of these electronic devices generateEMI RFI. Previously, EMI RFI shielding of electronic equipment was accomplished by conductive metallic housings. However, with the boom in the use of non conductive plastic materials in the electronic industry, particularly as sturdy, lightweight hous ings, EMI RFI has become a great problem. Much research has been undertaken to provide plastic housings having EMI RFI shielding effectiveness. Until recently, EMI RFI shielding effectiveness in plastics was accomplished by conductive coatings, metallization, and plating of molded plastic parts.These methods, while effective, are costly and labor intensive in that they require substantial amounts of material and involve secondary operations in preparing the final product. Recently, attempts have been made to prepare conductive plastics by incorporating in engineering thermoplastics certain conductive fillers.Specifically,. these fillers include conductive powders, flakes and fibers. Generally, approximately 25 40 by wt.of conductive powder, 36 49 by wt.of conductive flake or 25 30 by wt. in extruded parts, 3 6 in injection molded parts of conductive fiber must be present in order to obtain EMI RFI shielding. Materials Engineering, March, 1982, P. 3,7 43 Modern Plastics International, September, 1982,P. 46 49 . More recently, attempts have been made to find synergistic combinations of conductive fillers so as to provide extrudable andlor moldable i.e. injection molding, RIM, blow molding and the like compounds having consistent shielding at lower loadings which maintain properties in the finished part and are economical to make. Such combinations have included mixtures of flake and powder and mixtures of metallized glass fiber and carbon fibers. PendingEuropean Patent application 81 109 368 discloses the use of aluminum flake and or carbon fiber or a combination of either of them with carbon black powder. Although these compositions have high overallEMI RFI shielding effectiveness, they suffer from a loss of EMI RFI shielding effectiveness of up to 10 db or more at higher frequencies and a relatively low and inhomogeneous surfaces conductivity. SUMmARY It has now been discovered that conductive thermoplastic compositions may be prepared having high overall EMI RFI shielding effectiveness, improvedEMI RFI shielding effectiveness at high frequencies and improved surface conductivity. Generally, these properties are exhibited in thermoplastic compositions which have incorporated therein a synergistic combination of conductive fillers, namely metal flake, conductive fiber and conductive carbon powder. Specifically, the novel compositions of the present invention comprise a a thermoplastic polymer or polymer blend in which is incorporated b a combination of conductive fillers consisting essentially of 1 from about 25 to about 50 by weight of metal flake, 2 from about 2 to about 12 by weight of conductive fiber, and 3 from about 2 to about 15 by weight of conductive carbon powder wherein the weight ratio of metal flake to conductive fiber is from about 4 1 to about 14 1. Especially preferred conductive compositions are those where the conductive filler b consists essentially of 1 from about 25 to about 40 by weight of metal flake, 2 from about 4 to about 8 by weight of conductive fiber and 3 from about 3 to about 10 by weight of conductive carbon powder, wherein the weight ratio of metal flake to conductive fiber is from about 6 1 to about 10 1. Preferred thermoplastic polymers for which the invention is applicable include polyesters, polycar bonates, copolyestercarbonates, polyamides, polyarylene ether sulfones and ketones, polystyrenes, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers, polyetherimides, polyamide imides, polyphenylene ethers or blends thereof. These thermoplastic polymers may further comprise one or more addition polymers and or one or more rubber or rubber modified thermoplastic resins. Suitable metal flakes may be prepared from aluminum, copper, silver or nickel or alloys thereof.Any known conductive fibers may be used in the compositions of the present invention, however, the preferred fibers are metal or metal coated fibers.Metal fibers may be selected from the group consisting of silver, copper, nickel, aluminum or stainless steel. The metal coated fibers comprise a base fiber of glass, graphite and the like upon which a metal coat of nickel, silver, copper or aluminum is applied. The compositions may further comprise up to about 25 of glass fibers for reinforcement and or effective amounts of flame retardants. The novel compositions or composition of this invention can be Folded, foamed or extruded into various structures or articles, especially electronic equipment components or housings, requiring EMI shielding, and such structures or articles are included within the scope of this invention.

Suitable fibers may be of essentially any length and diameter which is practical from both a composition and processing standpoint, as known in the art. For example, aluminum fibers measuring 6 mm in length by 90 microns diameter are useful and practical, whereas stainless steel fibers of similar dimensions may be impractical and cause unnecessary wear on processing equipment instead stainless steel fibers of 3 mm length by 4 microns diameter may be more suitable. Generally, all suitable fibers will have a length of about 14 mm or less, preferably about 7 mm or less and a diameter of 0.2 mm or less, preferably of 0.1 mm or less. Once again, the actual dimensions of the fibers used depends in part on the composition of the fibers and their availability.

The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by known methods. For example, the additive ingredients may be placed into an extrusion compounder with the thermoplastic resin to produce molding pellets wherein the additive ingredients are dispersed in a matrix of the thermoplastic resin.Alternatively, the ingredients may be mixed with a thermoplastic resin by dry blending, then either fluxed on a mill and comminuted, or extruded and chopped. Further, the ingredients may also be mixed with powder or granular thermoplastic resin and directly molded, e.g., by injection or transferred molding techniques. Finally, the conductive thermoplastic composition of the present invention may be prepared by first forming a concentrate of any one or more conductive fillers in the base thermoplastic resin or any compatible thermoplastic resin i.e. one which will not cause delamination in the blended composition and then incorporating the concentrate into the composition by any of the foregoing methods or methods known in the art. The compositions of the present invention have many advantages over the conductive thermoplastics of the prior art. Generally, these compositions have improved overall EMI RFI shielding effectiveness.Most importantly, however, these compositions have greatly enhanced EMI RFI shielding effectiveness at high frequencies combined with greatly improved surface conductivity. The novel compositions or composites of this invention can be molded, foamed or extruded into various structures or articles, especially electronic equipment components or housings, requiring EMI RFI shielding, and such structures or articles are included within the scope of this invention.Examples, but not limited thereto, are panel boards for printed circuits, radio and television panels and housings, and housings for computers and large calculators, audio and high fidelity equipment, sensitive test instruments and the like. In order that those skilled in the art may better understand how to practice the present invention, the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. EMI Shielding effectiveness data was determined based on a coaxial transmission method developed byBattelle Laboratory of Columbus, Ohio. Shielding effectiveness is a measure of the attenuation ofEMI RFI expressed in decibels wherein attenuation is a function of the electrical conductivity and or magnetic susceptability of the shield. The decibel unit is a logarithmic measure of the degree of the shielding. A 10 decibel reading indicates that 90 of the EMI RFI energy is effectively dissipated. Twenty decibels means that 99 of the EMI RFI is dissipated, and so on. The shielding effectiveness is measured at various radio frequencies in MHz . In each of the following examples, shielding effectiveness was determined over a frequency range of 0.5MHz to 1000MHz. Unless otherwise specified, the following compositions were prepared extrusion compounding.
