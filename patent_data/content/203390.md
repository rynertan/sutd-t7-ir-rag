# PARTIAL HYDROLYZATES CONTAINING HYDROLZABLE MOIETIES FROM ORGANOSILANE COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
Disclosed is an ungelled partial hydrolysis product of an organosilicon containing material, a method for preparing the partial hydrolysis product, and a composition such as a coating composition containing the partial hydrolysis product. The or ganosilicon containing material for preparation of the ungelled partial hydrolysis product has an average functionality based on easily hydrolyzable Y groups attached to silicon atoms of greater than or equal to 2.4. The organosilicon containing ma terial for preparation of the ungelled partial hydrolysis product contains greater than or equal to 10 mole percent of at least one organosilane compound corresponding to the formula, R Si Y₃. in the aforesaid formula, R represents hydrogen or a C₁ C₁₀ group joined to Si through an Si C linkage. Each Y in the aforesaid formula represents an easily hydrolyzable group. The partial hydrolysis product is prepared by hydrolyzing a portion of the easily hydrolyzable groups of the organosilane com pound with a controlled amount of water. The amount of water employed in the controlled hydrolysis is determined according to the following formula, E
