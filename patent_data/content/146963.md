# Iir digital filter.

## Abstract
In an IIR digital filter, same polynomial is multiplied to both denominator and numerator of system function for the IIR digital filter so as to eliminate first order term from the denominator of the system function, thereby an IIR digital filter for high speed signal can be attained using an opera tion element of relatively low speed and small power consumption.
