# Liquid fluorine containing polymer and a process for the production thereof.

## Abstract
A process for producing a readily crosslinkable liquid fluorine containing polymer having a narrow molecular weight range distribution and containing iodine in the molecule in an amount of from 1 to 30 by weight based on the weight of the polymer, which process comprises polymerizing vinylidene fluoride and at least one other fluoroolefin in the presence of a radical producing source and an iodinated compound of the formula Rf.lx wherein Rf is a saturated perfluorocarbon group, a saturated perfluoroch lorocarbon group or a saturated fluorohydrocarbon group and x is an integer at least 1 corresponding to the bonding valency of Rf, whilst maintaining the proportion of the mole number of the monomeric components M to the mole number of the iodinated compound I in the range of from 10 to 1,200.
