# Process for making polyetherimides.

## Abstract
A process for making polyetherimides involving reacting an aromatic bis ether anhydride with an organic diamine in an inert solvent to form a prepolymer solvent mixture, effecting solvent removal by thin film evaporation, and heating the resulting prepolymer to a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the final polyetherimide product and less than 450 C to form the polyetherimide.
