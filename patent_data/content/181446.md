# Radiation image recording and read out system.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording system comprises a sup porting material 701 provided with a stimulable phosphor layer 702 an image recording section for exposing said stimulable phosphor layer to a radiation passing through an object 705 to store on said stimulable phosphor layer a radiation transmission image of said object an image read out section provided with a stimulating ray source 706 , means 707 for scanning said stimulable phosphor layer carrying said radiation image stored thereon in a first direction with a stimulating ray from said source, and a photoelectric read out means 708,709 for obtaining an electrical image signal an erasing means 710 means for moving said supporting material 701 relative to said read out section from a start position and in a second direction substantially parallel to said first direction thereby to allow two dimensional scanning means for returning said supporting material 701 and said read out section to said start position after the radiation image is read out from said stimulable phosphor layer, whereupon said erasing means 710 may operate to eliminate the radiation image remain ing on said stimulable phosphor layer prior to further image recordal thereon.
