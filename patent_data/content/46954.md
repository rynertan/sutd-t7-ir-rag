# SHAPED ARTICLE OF AROMATIC POLYAMIDE

## Abstract
A shaped article, such as film or fiber, of an aromatic polyamide is provided. The shaped article is prepared by incorporating in an aromatic polyamide 0.5 30 wt. , based on the aromatic polyamide, of a silicone compound such as a compound of the formula X Si OR â‚ƒ wherein R is alkyl and X is an organic functional group , and then, treating the resulting polymer composition with heat, ultraviolet rays and or electron beams. In addition to the silicone compound, a minor amount of a specified crosslinking compound may be incorporated in the aromatic polyamide. The shaped article exhibits improved heat resistance, electric characteris tics and dimentional stability.
