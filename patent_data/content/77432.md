# Retaining clip for an electrical connector.

## Abstract
A connector clip 12 is shown having a U shaped body member 30 including a base 34 and two parallel, extending legs 32 . The ends of each of the legs 32 define camming surfaces 42 and a socket retaining notch 44 . The clip includes a pair of first spacing feet 47 positioned medially upon each leg 32 and a pair of second spacing feet 36 located at the ends of a base member 34 . The feet 36, 37 serve to limit relative movement between the clip 12 and a plug 14 which holds the clip 12 to a circuit board 22 . A pair of spaced fingers 48 together with the circuit board 22 and the facing surfaces of the legs 32 define an access opening which serves to align the socket 24 with a plug 14 . The second embodiment of Figures 5 and 6 includes a pair of arms 50 which engage the circuit board 22 surface opposite the surface upon which the plug 14 is mounted. The arms 50 prevent relative movement between the clip 12 and the circuit board 22 .
