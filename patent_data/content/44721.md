# AIR FILTERS

## Abstract
Air filter elements employing a block of deep pleated paper and methods of their construction. A preferred filter element comprises top and bottom end members both adapted for through passage of air and a first pair of side walls, a block of deep pleated paper between the end members and the side walls, connections between adjacent edges of the end members and the side walls, at least two connections being hinged and at least one connection being interengaging elements, sealing structure comprising a second pair of side walls and at least one flange around one end member, the material of which structure rigidifies the connections and forms a seal with the pleated paper. The sealing structure is formed preferably from an elastomer which solidifies in situ. In a preferred method of construction the first side walls are hinged up from the bottom wall around the pleated paper block and connected at the top. The second side walls and end flanges are then formed of elastomeric material. Various other filter elements and constructional methods are described.
