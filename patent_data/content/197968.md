## Description
The invention relates to antiseptic cleansing compositions and in particular to those containing a water soluble salt of chlorhexidine N,N bis 4 chlorophenyl 3,12 diimino 2,4,11,13 tetraazatetradecanediimidamide as its active antibacterial ingredient. The transmission of pathogenic microorganisms by hands in medical practice has long been recognized as a source of infection in the treatment of patients and in surgery. Physical barriers such as surgical gloves often prove insufficient protection because of the high incidence of punctures and minor cuts by surgical instruments. Following the usual scrub up procedure, the application of antiseptic fluids to the hands of operating theatre staff prior to surgery is common practice to reduce viable organisms on the skin to a minimum. It would therefore be a great advantage to combine washing and disinfectant action in one single operation. Most suitable for a combined hand washing and degerming product would be an antibacterial agent which combines a broad antibacterial spectrum, covering the whole range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, with continuous residual bactericidal activity after application, and low irritation to the skin. Chlorhexidine has such properties and is available in water soluble forms such as the gluconate and acetate salts. A disadvantage of the chlorhexidine antibacterial agents is that through their cationic character they are incompatible with anionic surfactants. Combination with cationic surfactants for hand washing is not advisable as the high concentration of the cationic surfactant necessary for good detergency could give rise to skin irritation. Amphoteric surfactants, due to their anionic and cationic character, depending upon pH are equally unsuitable for the reasons given above. It was further found that chlorhexidine in combination with nonionic surfactants suffers considerable losses in antibacterial activity. Australian Patent 459 343 describes a skin cleansing composition containing salts of chlorhexidine in combination with a polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymer. The block copolymer is a low foaming nonionic surfactant, and high proportions of as much as 20 25 of such copolymers are necessary to give sufficient sudsing expected from that type of product, even when foam boosters such as an alkyl amine oxide is incorporated in the composition. The compositions exemplified in Australian Patent 459,343 contain 4 w v chlorhexidine which is well above the amount which normally would be required for skin disinfection. This is due to the fact that at the high concentration of nonionic surfactants, considerable deactivation takes place leaving only a small amount of the chlorhexidine available for antibacterial activity. US A 4456543 discloses a cleansing composition containing a bactericidal bisbiguanide compound and a surfactant selected from certain polyoxypropylenepolyoxyethylene block copolymers and polyoxyethylenepolyoxybutylene block copolymers. US A 4420484 discloses a cleaning composition comprising a basic amino or ammonium antimicrobial agent, a polyethylene glycol ester surfactant and a further surfactant selected from certain classes of betaines and amine oxides. EP A 136 231 discloses compositions containing chlorhexidine. Example 2 describes a hand cleansing composition containing a small amount of chlorhexidine, a small amount of an ethoxylated fatty alcohol and a much larger amount of an amphoteric betaine as a main cleansing agent. Example 5 in this reference describes a concentrate for dilution by 20 50 times , which concentrate contains 5 ethoxylated fatty alcohol. At a dilution of 1 20, the diluted concentrate will contain only 0.25 of the ethoxylated fatty alcohol. US A 2830006 discloses fungicidal and bactericidal compositions prepared by the reaction of an amine with dicyandiamide in the presence of a non ionic surfactant, as solvent. Examples 1 3 and 6 in this reference describes the preparation of compositions containing chlorhexidine dihydrochloride. It is well known that nonionic surfactants have an adverse effect on the skin, through defatting which increases with higher concentration especially on sensitive skin. High concentrations of chlorhexidine have an irritating effect on the skin. Reduction of the concentration of chlorhexidine and nonionic surfactants in a nonionic surfactant system, while still remaining sufficient available chlorhexidine for the desired antibacterial effectiveness, would not only effectively reduce the risk of skin irritation on repeated application, but also reduce costs of such compositions by a considerable degree. The hand and skin cleansing compositions of the invention have the following advantages These advantages of the new compositions do in fact allow the extension of their use from antiseptic hand and skin cleansing products to low cost compositions for the disinfection and cleansing of surgical instruments and inanimate surfaces in general. The present invention, therefore, provides an antiseptic cleansing composition comprising a water soluble salt of chlorhexidine, a nonionic surfactant and an inert diluent or carrier characterised in that the nonionic surfactant is one compound having the general formula RO CH₂CH₂0 The compositions of the invention find application as cleansers for animate or inanimate objects and surfaces. They can be used for cleansing and sterilising surgical and other instruments and as bath or shower additives or liquid antiseptic soaps. Suitable concentrations of water soluble chlorhexidine salt, for skin cleaners are from 1 to 4 w v, preferred concentrations being 2 and 4 w v and, for surface cleansers, up to 1 w v. The compositions of the invention can, if so desired, be manufactured as concentrates containing 5 to 10 w v of chlorhexidine for subsequent dilution. Any water soluble chlorhexidine salt selected from the gluconate, isethionate, formate, acetate, glutamate, succinamate, mono diglycollate, dimethanesulfonate, lactate, di isobutyrate and the glucoheptonate salt may be used in the compositions of the invention. These salts all have a water solubility of not less than 0.5 w v at ambient temperature. The preferred salts are the gluconate and the acetate. The optimum amount of chlorhexidine and the optimum ratio of chlorhexidine to surfactant will depend upon the surfactant chosen and can readily be determined within the specified limits experimentally. The nonionic surfactant chosen will depend on the intended application of the composition and is a compound of the general formula If it is desired to boost the activity of the compositions of the invention against Gram negative bacteria, suitable amounts of disinfectants active against Gram negative bacteria, such as antibacterial quaternary ammonium compounds can be added. Suitable inert diluents or carriers include water, the lower alkanols, such as ethanol or propanol, and mixtures of two or more thereof. If increased foaming characteristics are desired in the compositions of the invention, especially in hand washing compositions, foam stabilisers and boosting agents such as the higher alkymono or diethanolamides or alkyldimethylamino oxides can be included in the compositions of the invention. Such suitable agents are, for example, the lauryl or cocodiethanolamide or monoethanolamide condensates or the lauryl or cetyl dimethylamine oxides. Suitable quantities range from 2.0 to 4.0 by weight of the total volume, but their use is not restricted to such quantities depending on the concentration of the chlorhexidine salt and type of nonionic surfactant contained in the composition as such agents usually have some deactivating action on the antibacterial efficiency of the chlorhexidine salt. It will thus be necessary to check the effect of such agents on the antibacterial activity of the composition, and if necessary, adjust the quantity of foaming agent or chlorhexidine accordingly. If it is desired to increase the stability of the compositions of the invention for shelf life and temperature variation encountered in normal storage conditions, a small amount of an alcohol such as ethanol or isopropanol can be added. Suitable quantities are in the order of 3 to 5 v v. For optimal bactericidal efficiency, the pH of the final composition should be between 5 and 7, and preferably about 6.5. Any acid compatible with the components of the composition can be used to adjust the pH. Acetic acid is suitable in most cases. pH greater than 8 should be avoided to prevent precipitation of the chlorhexidine free base. The compositions of the invention may contain further conventional additives such as colouring agents and fragrances. Suitable dyes are for example, carmosine C.I. Food Red 3 , Blue E G C.I. Food Blue 2 and tartrazine C.I. Food Yellow 4 , or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the dyes are prepared as concentrates and added to the prepared composition. Other optional ingredients include preservatives, antioxidants, emollients and thickeners compatible with chlorhexidine. The following examples illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention. They should not be construed as limiting the claims hereto. The chlorhexidine gluconate is added to a quantity of water with stirring followed by the nonylphenolethoxylate until all has been dissolved. The cocodiethanolamide is added and the pH adjusted to 6.5 with 5M acetic acid followed by the glycerol. Carmosine dissolved in water is then added followed by a fragrance dissolved in isopropanol. The volume was made up to 100mL with water. This formulation is suitable for hospital ward and general use. The components were mixed as in Example 1. This product is intended for operating theatre, infectious ward and intensive care ward use. Procedure of Examples 1 and 2 was repeated with the inclusion of 0.5 and 1.0 w v of hydroxyethylcellulose respectively.
