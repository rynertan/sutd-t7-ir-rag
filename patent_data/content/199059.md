# Weft feeding device for weaving looms.

## Abstract
A weft feeding device for weaving looms comprises means to regulate the motor speed, according to the amount of yarn wound on the drum, said means consisting of at least two photoelectric cells 11, 12 , one of which 11 checks the amount of yarn 3 wound on the drum 1 , while the other 12 measures the transparency of the protection glass 15 provided on the cells. These photoelectric cells 11, 12 cooperate with an electronic circuit, which processes their signals 31, 32 in order to automatically compensate the transparency variations in said protection glass 15 , thereby allowing a more uniform regulation of the motor speed of the weft feeding device.
