# Parallel register transfer mechanism for a reduction processor evaluating programs stored as binary directed graphs employing variable free applicative language codes.

## Abstract
A parallel register transfer mechanism has been dis closed above for use in the evaluation of expressions of a variable free applicative language stored as binary directed graphs. The expression is reduced through a series of transformations until a result is obtained. A register file is provided with several crossbar networks interconnecting the various registers in the file for simultaneous transfer of their contents.
