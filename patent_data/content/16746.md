Neuroleptic effectsBehavioural and biochemical studies suggest that neurc leptic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol block central dopamine DA receptors. The DA receptor blockade as measured by different in vitro and in vivo techniques correlate roughly with the antipsychotic efficacy. The blockade of the behavioural effects induced by the DA receptor agonist apomorphine is highly correlated to the antipsychotic effect of various neuroleptics. The ability of potential neuroleptics to block the apomorphine induced behaviours may thus be a valuable predictor of the anti psychotic efficacy in man.MethodsMale Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 250 300 g, were used.The rats were observed in perspex cages and the behaviour was scored 5, 20, 40 and 60 min. after apomorphine. The compounds were injected intraperitoneally 60 min. prior to apomorphine hydrochloride 1 mg kg dissolved in saline , which was injected subcutaneously into the neck. This dose and form of administration was found to produce a very consistent behavioural response and very low variation in the response strength. Directly after the injection the animals were placed in the cages, one in each cage. Scoring of the stereotyples was performed by a modified version Fuxe et al. in Rhinencephale Neurotransmetteurs etPsychoses, by G. Masson, Paris 1977, F. 253 of the system introduced by Costall and Naylor Eur. J. Pharmacol. 24 B 1973 .The number of animals, displaying hyperactivity caused by apomorphine, was scored. Each group consisted of 6 8 animals. Saline controls were always run simultaneously.The ED50 s for stereotypies are the doses which reduce the strength of the stereotypies by 50 over the observation period of 60 min. The Ed50 s for hyperactivity are the doses which reduce the number of animals showing hyperactivity by 50 over the observation period of 60 min. ED50 s were calculated from log dose curves from 4 6 levels with 6 8 animals per doss level. The test compounds were dissolved in saline or water.ResultsThe results are summarized in Table 1. The secondary amine Example 3 was active and showed a preferential inhibition of the apomorphine induced hyperactivity. The hydroxyethyl piperazine compound Example 4 was found to block preferentially the apomorphine induced locomotion. Said compound was as potent as clozapine to block apomorphine induced hyperactivity and was more potent than clozapine to block the stereotypies.Table 1EMI14.1 tb SEP cl SEP ED50, SEP pmol kg SEP i.p. tb SEP Diastereomer SEP Stereo SEP Hyper tb Example SEP No. SEP A SEP ratio SEP typies SEP activity tb SEP Compounds SEP of SEP the tb SEP invention tb SEP 3 SEP A SEP SEP NHCH3 SEP 20 80 SEP 65 SEP 15 tb SEP 4 SEP N SEP N CH2CH2OH SEP 70 30 SEP 70 SEP 24 tb SEP Prior SEP art SEP comzounds tb SEP N CH3 2 SEP 55 45 SEP 35 SEP 6.4 tb SEP Chlorpromazine SEP 6.2 SEP 6.2 tb SEP Clozapine SEP 104 SEP 26 tb The apomorphine induced hyperactivity and stereotypies have been suggested to be due to stimulation of DA receptors in the limbic areas e.g. nucleus accumbens and striatum, respectively.It has also been proposed that the antipsychotic effect of the neuroleptics is connected with a blockade of DA receptors in the nucleus accumbens and the extrapyramidal side effects of these drugs to a blockade ofDA receptors in the stratum. The results of the present study indicate that the amines of Examples 3 and 4 may have antipsychotic effect s with low tendencies to induce extrapyramidal side effects. 2. Heart effectsMethodsMale Sprauge Dawley rats weighing 290 360 grams were used.The animals were prepared for recording the arterial blood pressure through a catheter implanted into the abdominal aorta and for injection of drugs through a catheter implanted into the abdominal vena cava. Both catheters were exteriorized at the base of the neck. At least five days were allowed for recovery after the operation.The animals were kept immobilized in restraining cages during the experiment. The arterial blood pressure was continuously monitored on a Grass Model 7 Polygraph via aStatham F23Gc transducer. Electrocardiograms were taken from subcutaneously placed thin needle electrodes and recorded on a Mingograph 34 Elema Schrnander AB, Sweden . Groups of rats ere given consecutive increasing intravenous doses of the test compounds from the dose scale 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, B, 16, 32 and 64 mol kg. The test compounds wereInjected over a period of 30 seconds at an interval of five minutes at doses of 0.25 8 umol kg and with an interval of 15 minutes at higher dose ranges.The minimum doses that caused changes in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, PR, QRS and OT intervals of more than 15 from values before administration were arbitrarily defined as a drug effect.ResultsThe results are shown in Table 2. The compounds of the invention caused heart effects only in doses substantially higher than the dose of the prior art compound that caused such heart effects. While the prior art compound produced a.rhytmias at 2 4 umol kg the tested compounds of the invention produced such effects only after administration of 16 and 64 mol kg, respectively. It is concluded from these findings that the compounds of the invention are markedly less heart toxic than the prior art compound tested.
