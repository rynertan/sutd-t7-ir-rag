# REFRESH CIRCUIT FOR DYNAMIC MEMORY OF A DATA PROCESSOR EMPLOYING A DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS CONTROLLER

## Abstract
In a data processing system including a dynamic RAM 14 and a programmable, prioritized direct memory access DMA controller 16 having a plurality of channels, the highest priority channel 0 is dedicated to a memory refresh operation. The system clock P CLK from the CPU 12 is applied to a divider counter 22 which produces a refresh clock R CLK having a period sufficient to generate the minimum number of refresh cycles within the minimum period required to refresh the RAM 14 . The refresh clock R CLK is used to set a D type latch 24 whose output, is turn, sets the highest priority DMA channel 0 request line DREQO , thereby initiating a memory refresh cycle. The latch 24 is cleared by the DMA acknowledge signal DACKO indicating the cycle is completed.
