# Echo canceller.

## Abstract
A digital adaptive echo canceller for use in cancelling echo signals caused by trans hybrid losses in two wire to four wire converters comprises first and second adaptive filters 20,22 each arranged to generate synthetic echo signals. Transfer control logic 23 compares difference signals relative to the difference between the synthetic echo signal generated by the first filter 22 , and a real echo signal and the synthetic echo signal generated by the second filter 20 and the real echo signal, and if the synthetic echo signal from the first filter 22 is closer to the real echo signal causes transfer of the coefficients of the first filter 22 to the second filter 20 such that the synthetic signal mixed with transmit ted speech signals in a mixer 24 is updated when neces sary.
