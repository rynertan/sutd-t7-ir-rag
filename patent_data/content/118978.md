# ADDRESS SEQUENCER FOR PATTERN PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An address sequencer 224 produces an address stream which includes a plurality of interleaved sequences of addresses. Each sequence is a function of input data which is received when an input pattern is sampled by that sequence, so that a repetitive address loop is generated which characte rizes the pattern. The address sequencer 224 includes a shift register 250 with a programmable feedback circuit 252, 254, 256, 258 which provides a feedback bit to the first stage of the shift register 250 based upon bits from selected stages of the shift register 250 . During each operating cycle of the address sequencer 224 , a counter 262 provides a sequence identification number which identifies a particular sequence. A stored address selected by the sequence identification number is provided as the present address for that sequence and the output of the address sequencer 224 . In addition, the shift register 250 is loaded with a multibit word derived from that stored address. The shift register 250 is then shifted a predetermined number of times, and the feedback bit is derived from stages of the shift register 250 which are selected based upon the sequence identification number. The next address of the sequence is derived from the contents of the shift register 250 after the shifting and is selected based upon a comparison of the input data which was received in response to the present address with a reference value. The next address is stored for use the next time the sequence identification number for that particular sequence occurs. A new cycle is then com menced by providing a new sequence identification number from the counter 262 . The production of interleaved sequences of addresses in the addressed stream enhances resolution of the pattern processing system, and permits processing of an image which contains a grey scale.
