# A three component polyester composition of use as a beeswax substitute.

## Abstract
Compositions useful as substitutes for natural beeswax are disclosed. Such compositions comprise a reaction product obtained by reacting under esterification conditions 1 an alcohol containing from about 10 to about 22 carbon atoms, 2 a glycolic component selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol having a molecular weight from about 100 to about 1500, and polyoxypropylene glycol having a molecular weight from 150 to about 1025, and 3 a difunctional acid containing from about 7 to about 36 carbon atoms. The foregoing reaction product may be optionally mixed with other esters, or with minor amounts of natural beeswax.
