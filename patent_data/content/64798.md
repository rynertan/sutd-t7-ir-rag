# Sensing devices for mounting in chamber walls and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A sensing device incorporating a sensing element 10 and terminals 12 for making electrical connection to the device is manufactured by placing the sensing element and the terminals in a mould and injection moulding a plastics body 14 around them. The integral plastics body firmly bonds the parts of the device together and can be shaped outwardly with a screw thread and a hexagonal nut portion so that the device can be screwed into a threaded aperture in a chamber wall. On application is a temperature indicator screwed into an automobile engine block.
