# Method and plant for generating power.

## Abstract
Power is generated by circulating Freon in a circuit where the Freon is vapourized, drives a gas turbine, and is condensed. The circuit is closed. The Freon can be condensed in a condenser 8 which is cooled by liquid natural gas in the process of being gasified. The Freon can be vapourized in a condenser 3 where hot steam coming from an industrial plant is condensed, while heating the Freon.
