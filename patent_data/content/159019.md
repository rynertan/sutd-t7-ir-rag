# AUTOMATIC AND AUTONOMOUS FLOATING PURIFIER WITH ROTARY BELT SEPARATION AND EXTERNAL RADIAL CIRCULATION

## Abstract
This Patent covers an automatic and autonomous float ing purifier consisting of a normally cylindrical and upright housing 1 with numerous compartment 4 each divided into two chambers 5, 7 , the outer chamber 5 being sup plied with polluted water through inlet openings 6 at water surface level where as the other chamber 7 is acting as a collecting tank for the pollutant, which is sticking to a mobile belt 8 a large number of mobile boxes 13 moving on the water surface by means of sliding or articulated devices, re ceiving the polluted water numerous suction pumps 17 each aspirating the water from a set of boxes one or more discharge outlets in the chamber 5 of the compartments 4 discharging the pollutant radially below the water surface so as to create a toroidal circulation by which the surface pol lutants are accumulated and directed towards the chambers 5 of the compartments 4 where the oil is separated from the water by adhesion to the belt 8 a storage tank 20 for the pollutants coming from the various chambers 7 and compartments 4 the storage tank being continuously emp tied and drained at intervals by pumping 21 . The separately driven recirculating pumps 17 will provide a jet by which the purifier can be moved and steered without needing any other conventional propelling devices. Furthermore, the pur ifier is fitted with all equipment and connections for com pletely automated operation and remote control.
