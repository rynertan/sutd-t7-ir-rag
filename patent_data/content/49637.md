## Description
Title Implement Supporting Arrangement The present invention concerns an improved implement supporting arrangement. There are known agricultural implements which are mounted on a wheel supporting arrangement or chassis, the position of the wheels relative to the chassis being movable to bring the implements from an operative ground engaging position to on inoperative transport position in which the implements are raised above ground level. Normally these chassis are of a general rectangular configuration the width of which is equal to or less than the maximum width permitted by road traffic regulations, and at least part of the implements can be pivotably mounted thereon such that in the transport position they lie within said maximum width. In certain instances it may be possible to mount various different implements on the chassis but in view of the configuration of the chassis and the mounting of the transport wheels the mounting facilities for the various implements and the space in which they may work is limited. Furthermore, the load applied to the chassis by different implements mounted at different points along the length of the chassis considerably varies the load on the tow bar. To a certain extent this variable load can be accomodated by the tractor linkage but this is not often possible or desirable. It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate these disadvantages. The invention provides therefore an implement supporting arrangement comprising a chassis, a tow bar assembly, meons whereby the inclination of the chassis with respect to a towing point of the tow bar assembly is odjustoble, o wheel assembly and means whereby the position of an axle of the wheel assembly with respect to the chassis is adjustable. Preferably the tow bar assembly has a variable length whereby the distance between the towing point and the axle of the wheel assembly is adjustable. Preferably the tow bar assembly comprises a frame pivotally attached to the chassis by link means and actuating meons connected between the chassis and the frame to control the pivotal movement of said link means relative to the frame and chassis thereby controlling the length between the tow bar assembly and the inclination of the chassis with respect of the towing point. The actuating means is preferably an hydraulic piston and cylinder device. Preferably holes may be provided in the link means, the chassis and or the frame such that the assembly is lockable in a number of positions by passing pins through corresponding holes. Preferably the frame is an A frame and Qlink is pivotally mounted to the ends of each limb of the A frame and to a cross member of the chassis. Preferably the chassis is provided by a single longitudinally extending member located along a central axis of the implement supporting arrangement. The single member may be a box section beam. Cross members may be fixed to the beam. A pair of axle support arms may be pivotally mounted to one of said cross members, the arms each supporting a stub axle extending on either side thereof, the stub axle carrying at least one wheel on each side of the arm. Preferably a linkage incorporating a bell crank lever and a connecting link is connected between each arm and the chassis and actuating means are provided for pivoting the bell crank and consequently noving the corms between upper and lower positions.The linkage including the bell crank and connecting link is so arranged that once a predetermined angle between the axis of the connecting link and that of the arm of the bell crony to which it is connected is reached further relative rotation therebetween is prevented as that further movement of the stub axles relative to the chassis is impossible. A cross bar is provided to interconnect the other arms of the bell cranks and actuating means, for example any hydrsulic piston and cylinder device may be pivotally connected between said cross bar and the chassis. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the acconpanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a plan of an implement support ar angement Fig. 2 is a side elevation thereof and Fig 3 is On end elevation thereof.In t drawings ports have been omitted from sone of the figures for clarit An implement support arrangement or trailer comprises a main longitudinal chassis member 10 arranged centrally of the arrangement, cross members 12 and 14 being fixed to each end of the member.A to bar assembly is attached to the front cross member 12 and comprises an A flame 16 having a towing eye 18 and a standard tow bar rest 20 at its apex, parallel members 22 fixed to the free ends of the A frame limbs, the members 22 supporting pivot pins 24 on which lints 26 are pivotally mounted, the links, at their other ends, being fixedly cunte about fixings 28 carried by the cross member 12. An hydraulic ram 30 is connected between the cross member 12 and the apex of the A frame and it will be realised that nsi n and contraction of the causes pivot l venant of fra 16 a out the pivot pi n ccorresponding movement of the towing eye to vary the inclination of the chassis member 10 with respect to the frame and the towing point. Sy this means the distance between the towing eye 18 and, for example the cxl of the wheels to be described later attach to the main member 10 may be varied to suit varying loads exerted on the arrangement. series of holes not shown are provided in the links 26 and members 22 of the P frame so that pins can be passed through corresponding holessio render the tow bar assembly immovable. An in.ermediote cross member 32 is fixed to the main member 10 and carries a bar 34 on which, ct either end, are pivotally rounted support arms 36, each arm being provided near its lower end with Q stub axle 38 extending on both sides of the arm and supporting one wheel 40 on each side of the arm. The lower end of each arm is provided with a pivot pin 42 about which a connecting link 44 is mounted, the connecting link in turn being pivoted about a pin 46 provided at the end of an arm 48 of a bell crank lever pivoted about a rod 50 supported on a further cross member 53 fixed to the main member 10. The ends of the other arms 52 of the bell cranks are pivotally mounted to c bar 54 which extends across the arrangement and is connected to one end of the piston of an hydraulic ram 56, the cylinder of which is pivotally connected to the rear cross member 14 of the arrangement.It will be realised that by extending and retracting the ram 56 each bell crank will pivot about its axis 50 and will cause pivotal movement of the wheel arms causing a raising or lowering of the wheels 40 relative to the main member 10. As a safely precaution to prevent movement of the wheels beyond a certain lowered position abutment means are provided on zh arm 48 of each bell crony so that when the axes of th pivots 50, 46 and to lie in a straight line further pivotal movement of the connecting links 44 relative to the arms 4w is prevented. The cross members and the nain member are adopted to support soil working implements, for example disc harrows, ploughs, rollers, and the unoccupied space beneath and to the sides of the main r r r facilities the mounting and opnrotion of these implements. None of the cross members exceeds the maximum width dimension for a trailed vehicle set down by road traffic regulations and the implements may be mounted in such a way that they can be pivoted bock within this dimension such that they can be transported on the public highway. In operation the hydraulic ram 56 is connected by way of suitable connections to the towing troctor s hydraulic system and is actuated to bring the wheels i, 2 zlr lowermost transport position so that the arrangement carrying the ground working implement can be towed to the location in which it is to operate. The implement can then be moved into and fixed at its operative position and thn ram 56 operated again to retract the wheels 40 so that the implements come into contact with the ground. It may be desirable to effect c weight transference and this may be achieved by adjusting the length of the tow bar assembly utilising hydraulic ram 30 so that the distance between the centre of gravity of the arrangement and the towing eye 18 is varied. The inclination of the chassis relative to the towing point is also varied in this manner. Thus if a first implement is fitted towards the towing point end of the chassis and c second implement is fitted to the rear side of the chassis, variation of the said inclination will cause either the first or the second implement to engage the ground. Also, one or more implements are preferably attachable to the chassis in one of a number of positions by co opération of fixings on the implements with additionel hole in the chassis. Various modifications can be made without departing fran the scope of the invention. The main chassis member need not be o rectongulcr section box girder but could, for example, be of circular section additional cross members could be provided thereon. The hydraulic rams could be replaced by other actuating means. The arrangement of wheels on the arms could be varied cnd the means for lowering and raising the wheel corrying arms modified, Attachment reans for a load platform or trailer could be provided on the main end cross m nbert. hereby the arrangement could be used as a load carrying trailer when the implements are not in u c.
