# The aglycone and pseudo aglycones of the AAD 216 antibiotics.

## Abstract
Novel aglycone and pseudo aglycones of the AAD 216 antibiotics are prepared by partial acid hydrolysis of the AAD 216 antibiotic complex or its individual factor antibiotics. AAD 216 aglycone, AAD 216 pseudo aglycone and AAD 216A pseudo aglycone, AAD 216B pseudo aglycone and AAD 216C pseudo aglycone exhibit antibacterial activity and are useful in animal health applications.
