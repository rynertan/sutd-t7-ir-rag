## Description
A remote control device for electric power load mana gement.The present invention relates to a remote controlled device for the limitation of the power which users can load on to an electric network.It is well known that the systems for the production transformation and distribution of electric power are negatively affected by peak loads which substan tially reduce the overall energy efficiency thus lowering the system utilization Factor.It is also well known that the yearly curve oP produced Dower,as referred to the average values ,h.as a particularShape, composed, mostly of waves that can be charac terized by amplitude and Frequency and to a lender extent. by other components of a casual type, which can not be systematiCally determined.It is also known that the correspondinq daily week ly, monthly and seasonal curves have different shapes according to the particular activities involved work ing, commercial, services, recreation etc.In addition, since electric power cannot be stored as it is, there are different ways of and diffieul ties in satisfyinq the variations in power demand, which may be related to long periods e.g. one months, or to short periods e.g. one day .In the first case, long term variations in power dc many, can be easily satisfied by operating or stopp ing one or more power plants the supply of power is thus easily regulated and usually. nothing more can be or is demanded by the consumers. In the second case. the short term variations in power demand actually present greater difficul ties, and certainly there are not strict and ef ficient methods for the regulation of both the supply and demand of power . At present, energy supply is controlled, even if in a discontinuous and occasional way, by discon necting, when it is strictly necessary and the peak power stations are not sufficient, some a reas of users. This procedure i however seldom possible, due to the presence of uer engaged in essential and or public utility services this procedure is adopted. rather to prevent the ex tension of a black out.The demand for power is instead modified, Certain ly not by a direct controlling. with suitable promotions or deincentivations through Pacilitat ed rates in the hours of lower load i.e. in the night hours or overcharged rates for the load peaks .But the reduction of the load peaks and the shift ing of the power to be loaded on the network to other periods of greater availability, whenever possible, is entrusted to the evaluation made by the individual customer of the practical disad vantage deriving from such operations versus the savings that can be thus realized and, usually.the disadvantages prove to be greater than the advantages related to lower rates offered,for the industrial, the commercial and the residential users.In some caees,differential rates cause waste of energy for the community,due to the shifting of the use of electricity instead of the use of fuel,by customers. It is also known that. at resent. in an electric network the remote control signals for the reduc tion of the loads are usually inserted at a le vel of voltage, said level being higher than that with which the user is supplied.This implies the solution, variable according to different cases, of remarkable technical problems, in addition to the need for the use of a remote control device requiring a high level of power and voltage to prevent the signals attenuation, particularly when they are passing from one level of voltage to the following one, through trans or mers and phase shifting transformers. The limita tions concerning the frequencies to be used for said signals are also known, an well ae the con sequent technical difficulties for the enlarging of the networks and of the growth of the number of users.Besides, the methods presently used are usually able to codify signals of the pulse interval kind.Finally, the existing direct load management systems have proved to be expensive, complicated and spe cially oriented just to switch out determined and prefixed specific loads, which, however , are not chosen by the users.The purpose of the present invention is to program and realize a direct load management with the re duction of peak loads, said reduction being con trolled by the Utility, leaving the individual u ser free to reSet liS load in the further greater power availability.Another important purpose is the prevention of black outs due to overloads, with respect to the effective supplying capability of the network, by limiting at a safety level the supplied power, by means of limited proportional reductions of the power loaded on the network.Another purpose, even if an optional one, of the present invention, is to modify the rate of the meters during the limi.ted offer periods, to gi ve users a discount on a fraction of power used, corresponding to a prefixed rate discount.An additional purpose of the present invention is to introduce the remote control signals di rectly at the level of the voltage of the users, and thereby to modulate the signal so that it can reach the individual user by means of the power line carrier system.Another purpose of the present invention is that of facilitating the use of analogical and digital signals.Finally, this invention has the purpose of ope rating with signals and equipment having a low power absorption, high reliability and low atte nuation. Other purposes and advantages will be apparent from the following description and from the enclosed drawing, showing, for exemplification purposes, an embodiment of the present invention.The set of devices needed to reduce, in the hours when it is deemed necessary, the maximum power a available to every individual user, in percentage of the maximum value stated in the contract with the Utility, consists of an electronic device in stalled by each individual user, whereby said de vice 1 is able to detect, through a proper signal, the instantaneous power loaded by the user 2 is able to detect and decodify the signal trans mitted by the Utility, and compare the same with the former signal, and, under certain con ditions, partially or totally to switch off the user s load, at the same time activating the optional module for rate reduction, and or other possible modules. Resuming, the basic concept of the equipment is the following when the Utility considers it con venient, in the interest of the service and the refore of the community, to reduce the load on the network, it can transmit to the above devices a signal having an intensity proportional to the percentage of the expected reduction, this latter signal then produces at local level, for those u sers which in that moment are absorbing an amount of power higher with respect to the contract va lues than the value related to the transmitted signal, a partial disconnection of the load, thus causing the desired load reduction on the network for the planned period.This operation clips the load peaks, and the ad vantages that can be obtained are all those of social and eecllc mical order due to a lower cost of power, through better planning of energy re sources, and investments, and through the pre vention of black outs. Tests with prototypes highlighted the effect veness and the advantages of the present inven tion.The present invention, in a preferred embodiment, is shown in schemes in the enclosed drawing, whe re in four interconnected block diagrams are in dicated, in the following order Schema A an electric network, in a single wire representatioii Schema B a signal generator GS Schema C a relaying device RT Schema D a receiver R , connected with each other in the way and for the functions which will be hereafter exposed.Schema A shows the production line P with the power plant G and the external supplier vector AC , followed by the high voltage AT , medium voltage MT and finally by the low vol tage BT lines, interconnected through substa tions and step down transformers T .Also the users U are indicated, either for the low and medium, or for high voltages, the last two having usually their own substations and step down transformers T1 . Here also the positions of the relaying deviceRT and of the receivers R in the low voltage BT systems are indicated.In the meditun MT and high voltage AT systems appear the modified receivers R1 , which will be discussed later.Schema D shows the bloc diagram of the signal generator GS, consisting of a regulated pfxçrer supply 1 e.g. 220V AC 12V DC, 500 mA a fixed frequency oscillator working in the audio t al .. 3900 Hz a pilot generator 3 , producing the desired frequency comprised, e.g., between 30 and 100 Hz square wave a modulator 4 , which modulates the fixed fre quency with the frequency of the pilot gene rator e.g. in modulated frequency with a 5 deviation a system of filters for low pass 5 and high pass 6 , limiting the band of frequency of the resulting signal e.g. an active filter with a cutting frequency, respectively. of 3400 and 2400 Hz, so as to leave available, in the telephone channel, the 300 to 2400 Hz band for other possible uses an output stage 7 which regulates the out put impedance in such a way as to allow the contemporary loading of several telephone lines 8 . The output signal is then sent, through a line of the telephone type, to the RT relaying devices.It must be borne in mind that the pilot generator 3 that establishes the signal to be sent is ma nually operated or also, possibly, automatical ly to obtain a particular reduction of the loads on the power network in the desired times and for the desired durations e.g. 30 Hz cor respond to a O 0 reduction, while 100 Hz corre spond to an 80 reduction of the allowable power drawing, an amount equal to 209 being the mini mum guaranteed for the essential and undelayable neetis , and tiat the area covered by a signal generator GS can be anyhow extended, as the te lephone network assures the quality of the trans mitted signals.Schema C 1 shows the block diagram of the RT re laying device, which is composed of a regulated power supply 9 e.g. 22AV AC 8V DC, 10 mA in stand by and 100 mA when the entire circuit is operating an input circuit with telephone transformer 13 which delivers the signal to demodulator 14 a demodulator 14 which gives the demodulated signal ald the order for the starting up of the whole receiver e.g. a synchronous recei ver, based on the integrated circuit I.C. NE 567 tone decoder rhase lacked loop , which will supply the frequency demodulated signal along with an on off signal according to the presence or respectively the absen ce of the carrier a controller 11 of the relays 10 and 19 e.g. a medium power transistor, controlled by the carrier of the demodulator 14 a relay 10 , which gives power to the second part of the circuit a fixed frequency oscillator 12 , generating the carrier frequency e.g. a 140 kiiz sine wave a modulator 15 , which modulates the oscilla tor s 12 carrier e.g. amplitude modulation by interruDtion of the carrier with the sig nal received from the demodulator 14 e.g. 30 to 100 Hz square wave , and supplies a low power signal a narrow band nd filter 16 a power amplifier and a coupling filter 17 a set of relays 18 to introduce the signal in the power network a second stabilized power supply 20 switch ed on by relay 19 e.g. 220V AC 18V DC, 5A a relay 19 to connect the power supply 20. Schema D shows the layout of the receiver R.It is composed as follows the meter t27 installed by the Utility a current limiting switch 28 with function of power limiter, of the same kind as that installed by the Utility, but with a releas ing coil e.g. 220V AC, 100 VA a possible blocking inductance 34 tuned on the carrier, if the blocking inductances of the meter s 27 amperometric coils and tho se of the limiter 28 and of the current to voltage converter 31, are insufficient a stabilized power supply 29 e.g. 220V C 8V DC, 10 mA in stand by and 100 mA when the receiver is in full operation a current to voltage converter 31 with very low losses, which supplies to the comparators 32 and 25 a signal which varies in direct pro portion to the user load current e.g. a set of miniature transformers, with a silicon steel core and trimmed air gap, whose prima ry windings are composed of one or two turns with a suitable section wire, connected in series on each phase of the incoming power line, and whose secondaries, made of several thousands turns, are connected to a rectify ing levelling circuit whose output voltage is determined by the most loaded phase a differential comparator amplifier 32 which, over a given threshold, will supply a signal to pilot a circuit 33 for the intervention of the electronic switch 30 an electronic switch 30 to feed the entire remaining circuit e.g. a medium power tran sistor a trigger circuit 33 which controls the ele ctronic switch 30 and is excited by the dif ferential comparator 32 and is possibly kept on by the signal emitted by the device 26, when the signal is on an input circuit 21 with high galvanic in sulation, to pick up the signal from the pow er line e.g. through a capacitive coupling an amplifier 22 a demodulator 23 e.g. a synchronous recei ver based on the mentioned I.C. NE 567 tone decoder phase locked loop , Prom which the signal on ofF will be picked up, so as to fully utilize the characteristic of high out of band signals and noise rejection, obtaining the 30 to 100 Hz square wave sig nal at the output a Prequency to voltage converter 24 e.g., based on the I.C. LM 2907, which delivers an output voltage, which varies proportio nally to the input frequency a comparator 25 which compares the output CF the freuency to voltage converter 24 with that of the current to voltage converter 31 and delivers, when the former voltage is great er than the second one, a control signal to relays 35 and 36 a treshold device 26 which, in the present ce of an output signal coming from the fre quency to voltage converter 24, even if this signal is not sufficiently high to be operat tive for the comparator 25, will supply and maintain a controlling voltage to the trigger circuit 33 and to the optional rate reducer 37 a solid state delayed relay e.g. 3 sec. 35 , which controls the coil of limiter 28, an optional, solid state delayed relay e.g. 2 sec. 36 , controlling the coil of a re mote control switch 40 that the user can in stall for delayable loads the relay 36 can be multiplier for tlrariual delays, depending on the demand of the users one or more possible remote control switches 40 of the user a possible user s switch for essential unde layable loads, 39 an optional control for rate reduc.tions 37 which, when excited by the same pulse activat in 3 the switch 40 and kept alive by the thresh old device 26, will activate the relay 38 a relay 38 for inserting a calibrated impe dance in series wit the voitmetric one of the meter 27 a warning light 41 , informing the user that the system is in operation and that the rate reduction is being applied.In the cases of users connected to the high AT and medium MT voltage network which have their own transforming units, the receivers R, modi fied to type R1, must be mounted directly after the transformers.There are no RT relaying devices.The GS signal generators send their signals di rectly to the receivers which have been modified in the following way R1 the moduli 21, 22 and 23, which are respectively receiver, amplifier and demodulator for carried waves, are replaced by the moduli 13 and 14, which are respectively receiver and demodulator for te lephone signals therefore also the solid state relays 35 and 36 and other possible ones will drive suitable power remote control switches, and the current to voltage converter 31 may be connected to the network through convenient measurement tranrformers, the same as it could be done with the meters 27.Resuming, the system remains basically the sa me, with the difference that measurements, signals and operations are made through the conventional measurement transformers and remote power control switches.The system, which remains the same also in the conceptual line from the inventive standpoint, will improve the industrial characteristics the reof because of the fact that, by eliminating the power line carrier system, the same practically eliminates any complication, although solved, due to the signal to noise ratio, anti improves the technical economical performances thereof, as said system can be applied to the more privi leged users, particularly to the medium voltageMT users the high voltage AT users being gene rally self producers and or users with particu lar contracts regarding the interruption of the supply , that represent only a small percentage of the users, although those users contribute to a large part of the load on the electric network.The global dynamic operation of the system will be resumed hereinbelow For clarity sake, the internal working of the signal generator GS and of the relaying deviceRT, and also some details of the receiver itself will be overlooked, also because the same were already sufficiently described in the precedinq general illustration of the block diagrams.It is already said that the signal generator can be operated manually7and also automatically.Anyhow the operation depends on the analysis of the existing difference, instant by instant, on the network between the power requested by the us ers and the power available in the network, and also on the rate of growth of this difference and on the dynamic level of risk that the Utility wants to assume in short, it depends on all tho se parameters presently available to an area dispatcher through the reading of instruments and messages. At present, the dispatcher operates at a supplymanagement level, and only if the probability of a black out issilaping out, disconnects the lower priority areas. It does not instead effect any operation for the load management1,. The proposed system foresees, instead, the re duction of the loads on the network through the operation, on appropriate scale, of the signal generator GS. The signal will reach, with the particular value that the same can attain in any instant, the comparators 25 of the receivers in stalled in the premises of the users.On the other hand, the comparator 25 receives also a signal coming from the current to volta ge converter 31, and which represents the electric load of the user in form of a percentage of its contract for the supply, inclusive of a minimal fraction, determined by the comparator 32, re lated with the essential, undelayable needs.These two signals are expressed by low current, reference voltages, which assume the zero value for a zero load, and maximum reduction, and re spectively unitary value for the maximum con tract load and zero reduction.As long as the reduction voltage is greater than the l load voltage , the system is non ope rating. Otherwise, as soon as the reduction voltage goes lower that the load voltage or, obviously, the load voltage rises above the reduction voltage , a signal will be given by the comparator this signal will power first the relay 36, properly delayed to avoid the in tervention thereof in cases of momentary over loading by the user.The relay 36 will activate the remote control switch 40 which, if existing, will disconnect the own fraction of load, properly selected by the user, so that if the residual load does no longer cause the condition voltage reduction voltage load , the same will switch off any o ther intervention.On the contrary, and after the prescribed time for the greater delay of the relay 35 has e lapsed, this relay will operate the limiter 28, thus disconnecting the user. The reset of the voltage can be done by the user by resetting the remote control switches, after a proper re duction of the load. The total load can be charg ed again as soon as the power reduction is longer operating, a condition that can be signal led to the user by a warning light 41.For what concerns the rate reducer 37, the intro duction whereof being optional, the same can ope rate by two different modes the first one is by operating only after the first operation of the relay 36 that is, from the moment in which the signal sent by the Utility has caused a re duction of the power used by tht userB, and the second mode is by operating in any case with the presence of the signal through the device 26 both modes will end as soon as the Utility stops operating the reduction.For what concerns a preferred embodiment, refe rence can be made to the indications given, for exemplifying purposes, in the text, generally between brackets.It must be kept in mind that some of the moduli and some of the components of the invention are either optional or can be replaced with similar moduli and components having analogous functions, anyhow combined, and this depends both on the specific lay out of the distribution network, on the production and design structure of the firm charged with the serial production of the devic es, and on the market availability of the compo nents, at the time of the production.As an example, the distribution signal could al so be a binary signal, coded by modulating the transmission with a sequerlce of bits having a fixed length. In this last case, it would be necessary to decode it by means of a serial parallel converter, at the output whereof it would be found the value of the binary number, represented digit by digit e.g. with four bits the values from zero to 15 can be shown . Through a further decoding, this number can ser ve one of several outputs or, through a digi tal to analogic converter, said number can ge nerate d if f er ent reference voltages. It is rstood that the result of the descrip tion, whcih has explicative purposes and in no way represents a limitation, can be varied, a dapted and combined, without therefore going out of the limits of the present cntion. This means that the present invention, illustra ted and described hereinbefore for exemplifying purposes, must be considered as extensible to such accessory variants which are comprised in said invention.
