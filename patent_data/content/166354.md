## Description
Cholecystokinin CCK is a neuropeptide composed of thirty three aminoacids. See Mutt and Jorpes, Among additional effects of CCK are stimulation of colonic motility, stimulation of gall bladder contraction, stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion, and inhibition of gastric emptying. CCK reportedly co exists with dopamine in certain mid brain neurons and thus may also play a role in the functioning of dopaminergic systems in the brain as well as serving as a neurotransmitter in its own right. See A. J. Prange et al., Peptides in the Central Nervous System , CCK antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of animals, especially humans. Three distinct chemical classes of CCK receptor antagonists have been reported. One class comprises derivatives of cyclic nucleotides detailed structure function studies have demonstrated that of the various members of this class, butyryl cyclic GMP, is the most potent. See N. Barlos et al., Several benzofused Lactam compounds are known as inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme as described in EP A 0 119 161, EP A 0 072 352 and EP A 0 107 095 but so far have not been used for the manufacturing of preparations which are CCK antagonists. It has now been found that the benzofused lactam compounds of this invention are antagonists of cholecystokinin CCK . These CCK antagonists are useful in the treatment and prevention of CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, especially humans.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in U.S. Patents 4,256,108 4,160,452 and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release. In some cases, formulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions normally contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients may be The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n propyl p hydroxybenzoate one or more coloring agents one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspension may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin.

In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. A composition prepared according to the inventive use may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compositions of the invention are employed. The compositions are suitable for the administration of the desired daily dosage. The said dosage will vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient s symptoms. However, in most instances, the effective dosage per unit will be so, that it makes possible the administration in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg kg and preferably 5 mg to about 500 mg kg related to a compound of formula I in a single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. Therefore, it should be understood that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The biological activity of the compounds of Formula I have been evaluated using an ¹²⁵I CCK receptor binding assay and CCK 33 was radiolabeled with ¹²⁵I Bolton Hunter reagent 2000 Ci mmole as described by Sankara et al. Male Sprague Dawley rats 200 350g were sacrificed by decapitation. The whole pancreas was dissected free of fat tissue and was homogenized in 20 volumes of ice cold 50 mM, Tris HCl pH 7.7 at 25 C with a Brinkmann Polytron PT 10. The homogenates were centrifuged at 48,000 g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in Tris Buffer, centrifuged as above and resuspended in 200 volumes of binding assay buffer 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.7 at 25 C, 5 mM dithiothreithrol, 0.1 mM bacitracin, 1.2 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mM o phenanthroline . For the binding assay, 25 µl of buffer for total binding or unlabeled CCK 8 sulfate to give a final concentration of 1µM for nonspecific binding or the compounds of Formula I for determination inhibition of ¹²⁵I CCK binding and 25 µl of ¹²⁵I CCK 33 30,000 40,000 cpm were added to 450 µl of the membrane suspensions in microfuge tubes. All assays were run in duplicate or triplicate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes and centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge 4 minutes immediately after adding 1 ml of ice cold incubation buffer. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded, pellets were counted with a Beckman gamma 5000. CCK 33 was radiolabeled and the binding was performed according to the description for the pancreas method with modifications according to Saito, et al. Male Hartley guinea pigs 300 500g were sacrificed by decapitation and the brains were removed and placed in ice cold 50mM, Tris HCl plus 7.58 g l Tritma 7.4 pH 7.4 at 25 C . Cerebral cortex was dissected and used as a receptor source. Each gram of fresh guinea pig brain tissue was homogenated in 10 ml of Tris Trizma buffer with a Brinkman polytron PT 10. The homogenates were centrifuged at 42,000 g for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in Tris Buffer, centrifuged as above and resuspended in 200 volumes of binding assay buffer 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.7 at 25 C, 5 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM EGTA, 0.4 BSA bovine serum albumin , 0.25 mg ml bacitracin . For the binding assay, 25 µl of buffer for total binding or unlabeled CCK 8 sulfate to give a final concentration of 1µM for nonspecific binding or the compounds of Formula I for determination inhibition of ¹²⁵I CCK binding and 25 µl of ¹²⁵I CCK 33 30,000 40,000 cpm were added to 450 µl of the membrane suspensions in microfuge tubes. All assays were run in duplicate or triplicate. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 C for 2 hours and centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge 4 minutes immediately after adding 1 ml of ice cold incubation buffer. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded, pellets were counted with a Beckman gamma 5000. Male Hartley guinea pigs 400 600 g were sacrificed by decapitation. The whole gall bladder was dissected free from adjacent tissues and cut into two equal halves. The gall bladder strips were suspended along the axis of bile duct in 5 ml organ bath under 1 g tension. The organ bath contained a Kreb s bicarbonate solution NaCl 118 mM, KCl 4.75 mM, CaCl₂ 2.54 mM, KH₂PO₄ 1.19 mM, Mg SO₄ 1.2 mM, NaHCO₃ 25 mM and dextrose 11 mM maintained at 32 C and bubbled with 95 O₂ and 5 CO₂. Isometric contractions were recorded using Statham 60 g 0.12 mm strain gauges and a Hewlett Packard 77588 recorder. The tissues were washed every 10 minutes for 1 hr to obtain equilibrium prior to the beginning of the study. CCK 8 was added cumulatively to the baths and EC₅₀ s determined using regression analysis. After washout every 10 minutes for 1 hr , the compound of Formula I was added at least 5 minutes before the addition of CCK 8 and the EC₅₀ of CCK 8 in the presence of the compound of Formula I similarly determined. Longitudinal muscle strips with attached nerve plexus were prepared as described previously Compounds of Formula I inhibited specific ¹²⁵I CCK 33 binding in a concentration dependent manner with an IC₅₀ less than or equal to 100 µM such as for example 1 t butoxycarbonylmethyl 3 1 carboethoxy 3 3 indolyl 1 propyl aminohomodihydrocarbostyril at 4.2 µM shifted CCK dose response to the right approximately 2.6 fold without affecting maximal responses in guinea pig ileum. Ethyl 3 1 ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl amino 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 2 oxo 1H 1 benzazepine 1 acetate at 26 µM caused about 10 times shift of CCK dose response in the guinea pig gall bladder without reducing maximal responses. These results indicate that the compounds of Formula I are competitive antagonists of CCK in these tissues. The compounds of this invention can also be administered in combination with antihypertensives and or diuretics and or calcium entry blockers. Typically, the individual daily dosages for these combinations can range from about one fifth of the minimally recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly. The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by any convenient process. Useful processes are illustrated by the following reaction equations wherein R₁ R₅ and n are as defined above unless otherwise indicated. Benzofused lactam Groups R₅ may be modified by known methods, if desired. For example, if R₆ Et or t Bu, the diester I can be converted to the monoester R₆ Et or H by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. If R₆ Et, I can be converted to the diacid R₆ H by basic hydrolysis. Alternatively, III may be alkylated with V in the presence of a strong base, like sodium hydride, and the intermediate IX converted to VI by reaction with an azide salt as described above. If desired, IX may be prepared by the alkylation of X prepared from II using the alternate conditions of Nagasawa, above with V to afford intermediate XI . Treatment of XI with hydrogen and a catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, affords IX . Alternatively, IX Y Cl, Br R₆ OH may be converted to the iodo compound IX X I by known methods, for example, sodium iodide in acetone. Reaction of this iodo lactam with an amino acid ester in a solvent such as toluene or DMF in the presence of a halide scavenger such as Ag₂O gives I R₆ OH . If desired, IV may be reduced with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst to afford XII which can be alkylated with a ketoester in the presence of hydrogen on a suitable catalyst to give XIII. Alternatively, sodium cyanoborohydride may be used. Alkylation of XIII to afford I R₆ OH can be carried out with an iodoester in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as THF. In the compound of Formula I, the carbon atoms to which R₁, R₂ and R₄ are attached and the ring carbon atom to which the group is attached may be asymmetric. Thus, the compounds of this invention exist in diastereoisomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The processes described above can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as starting materials. When diastereomeric intermediates or products result from the synthetic procedures, the diastereomeric intermediates or products can be separated by chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. When racemic mixtures result, they may be resolved by crystallization of salts of optically active acids or bases or by other methods known in the art. The partstructures of Formula I can be in two configurations S or R and both are within the scope of this invention, although S is generally preferred. Both configurations at the carbon to which R₂ is attached are encompassed within this invention. The following Examples illustrate preparation of representative compounds of Formula I.

A solution of 0.7 gm of 1 t butoxycarbonylmethyl 3 amino homodihydrocarbostyril Compound D, Example 3 , 0.6 gm of ethyl 4 β indolyl 2 oxobutyrate and 0.27 ml of acetic acid in 10 ml of absolute ethanol was stirred 1 hour at room temperature. To the stirred solution was added dropwise over a 7 hour period a solution of 0.38 gm of NaCNBH₃ in 10 ml of ethanol. After stirring a further 12 hours, the reaction was concentrated at reduced pressure and partitioned between H₂O and ethyl acetate. After extracting twice with ethylacetate, the combined organic layers were filtered through MgSO₄, concentrated The dimethyl ester The mono ethyl ester The mono benzyl ester Z may be prepared from 3 amino hexahydrobenzoazocine by a sequence analogous to that described in Example 7.
