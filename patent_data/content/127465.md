# Pressure sensing device for holding a toothbrush.

## Abstract
A device 10 for sensing the amount of force applied to the teeth during brushing is disclosed. The device includes a toothbrush holder 100 pivotally supported inside a sleeve 200 . O rings 120, 122 mounted on the holder act both as fulcrum for the holder and as resistance members to resist the pivoting of the holder inside the sleeve. An adjustment cap 220 is threadedly mounted on the sleeve and can adjustably compress the O rings to provide variable resistance to the pivoting of the holder. An electrical circuit comprised of fixed and floating contacts detects the holder pivotal movement and lights up a bulb 216 to indicate that the holder is pivoting. A battery 206 is carried in the sleeve to power the circuit.
