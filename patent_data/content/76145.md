# PROCESS FOR FORMING A BARRIER PHASE IN COSMETIC PRODUCTS AND THE LIKE

## Abstract
A process for forming a barrier phase between two incompatible phases comprising forming a thin layer of barrier material on the outer surface of a pin placing the coated pin into a package or mold form designed to contain the total product, putting the molten outer phase into the space between the coated pin and the outer wall s of the package or mold form and allowing the outer phase to solidify removing the pin leaving the barrier phase attached to the outer phase and putting the inner phase into the space previously occupied by the pin.
