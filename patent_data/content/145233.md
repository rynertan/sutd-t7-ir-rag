# Separation processfor a 3 hydroxybutyrate polymer.

## Abstract
An aqueous suspension of micro organism cells con taining a 3 hydroxybutyrate polymer are subjected to a proteolytic enzyme digestion and or a surfactant digestion in order to solubilise cell material other than the 3 hydroxy butyrate polymer. Prior to, or during the digestion, but before any proteoly tic enzyme digestion step, the suspension is heated to at least 80 C to denature nucleic acids which otherwise hinder separation of the 3 hydroxybutyrate polymer containing residue from the suspension.
