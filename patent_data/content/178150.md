# PRODUCTION OF IMPROVED PELLETS FROM MELT PROCESSABLE POLYMER WHICH IS CAPABLE OF FORMING AN ANISOTROPIC MELT

## Abstract
Improved pellets comprising a melt processable thermo tropic liquid crystalline polymer e.g., a wholly aromatic poly ester are provided. The molten anisotropic melt forming poly mer, while present as a thin film of the specified thickness at an appropriate temperature, is subjected to reduced pressure conditions whereby residual volatiles are evolved and re moved, and the polymer thereby is densified to the specified degree prior to pellet formation. The resulting densified polymer next is melt extruded and is cut to form pellets while at an appropriate temperature. It sur prisingly has been found to be of prime importance that the resulting pellets possess a density of at least 95 percent of the theoretical maximum eg., a polymer density of approximately 1.35 to 1.4 gram cc. if the advantages of the present inven tion are to be fully realized. These pellets have been found to be capable of undergoing melt processing to form shaped arti cles having improved physical properties. For instance, such shaped articles exhibit markedly smoother surface characteris tics and can be used at elevated temperatures for extended periods of time while better retaining the desired surface char acteristics.
