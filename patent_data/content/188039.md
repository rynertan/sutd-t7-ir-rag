## Description
,PROCESS FOR SYNTHESIS OF 2 VINYL 4,6 DIAMINO S TRIAZINE Background of the Invention 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of 2 vinyl 4,6 diamino S triazine hereinafter referred to as VT . More particularly, the present invention provides a process for preparing VT in large quantities at low costs. 2 Description of the Prior Art VT is a compound which is valuable as a comonomer, and it is known that if a diamino S triazine is introduced into side chains of a polymer, the softening point and glass transition point of the polymer are greatly elevated as compared with those of the unintroduced polymer, and the specific gravity is increased and the solubility is prominently changed see, for example, Nadao and Kakurai Collection of PolymerTheses, 32, 308 1975 and T. Seo, K. Abe, H. Honma andT. Kakurai Polym. Prepn., 20, 661 1979 . Several processes as described below are known for the synthesis of VT. Namely, there can be mentioned a process in which biguanide is reacted with acrylic acid, chloride C. G. Overberger et al J.A.C.S., 80, 988 1958 , a process in which dicyandiamide is reacted with dimethylaminopropionitrile French Patent No.1,563,255 1967 to Hoechst AG , a process in which 1,2 di li ,6 diamino S triazinyl 2 cyclobutane is heated at 32O0C under reduced pressure Japanese PatentPublication No. 35068 71 to Asahi Kasei , and a process in which 2 p methoxyethyl 4,6 diamino S triazine is heated at 3500C in a nitrogen current Suddeutsche Kalkstickstsff Werke A.G. Offen. 2, 135, 881 1973 . However, these known processes are defective in that the starting materials are expensive or the reaction procedures are complicated. Accordingly, none of these known processes are suitable for industrial working.

It is preferred that the wall of the upper portion of the reaction vessel be air cooled or water cooled. The adhering reaction product is collected and washed with water to remove the imidazole compound, and the residue is recrystallized from water to obtain intended VT. When the isocyanuric acid addition adduct of the imidazolyl S triazine compound is used, the adduct is heated at 180 to 320 0C under a reduced pressure of about 5 to about 20 mmHg for an appropriate time in the presence of an appropriate polymerization inhibitor in an appropriate reaction vessel in which a reduced pressure as described above can be maintained. VT and the imidazole compound are sublimated to adhere to the wall of the upper portion of the reaction vessel. It is preferred that the wall of the upper portion of the reaction vessel be air cooled or water cooled. A higher degree of the pressure reduction is preferred, but about 5 mmHg is sufficient. The reaction time is within one hour. The adhering reaction product is washed with water to remove the imidazole compound and isocyanuric acid.The residue is recrystallized from water to obtain intended VT. As typical examples of the polymerization inhibitor to be used in the present invention, there can be mentioned sodium sulfide, potassium sulfide, hydroquinone, copper sulfate and p naphthylamine.
