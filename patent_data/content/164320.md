## Description
New pharmaceutical preparations and a new method of alleviation of painField of the InventionThe present invention is related to new pharmaceutical preparations, a method for their preparation and to a new method of alleviation of postoperative pain and pain related to pathophysiological changes in man, such as severe chronic pain, wherein the new pharmaceutical preparations are used. Background of the InventionThe suffering from pain after operations, and that related to diseases as cancer and neurological diseases, has been the subject to treatment with e.g. opiate analgesics. These have several severe draw backs, as e.g. development of tolerance, addiction and sedation with risk for respiratory depression. There is thus a need for analgesic agents intended for pain relief post operatively and for relief of severe pain of other origins, which do not have the mentioned draw backs.In recent years, several possible alternative mechanisms for treatment of pain have become evident. One of these is described by Reddy andYaksh. Reddy, S.V.R. and Yaksh, T.L. Brain Res. 189, 391, 1980. According to this reference noradrenaline causes a dose dependent antinociceptive effect in rats and monkey. As the animals in this testing situation show an impaired responsiveness to thermal pain of the tail in the tail flick d Amour, F.E. and Smith, D.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 72, 74, 1941 or the feet in the hot plate test Eddy, N.B. and Leimbach,D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 107, 385, it is conceivable that this is a strong experimental support for an analgesic effect of the administered drug.Outline of the InventionAccording to the present invention it has been found that the known compound guanfacine 2,6 dichlorophenyl acetyl guanidine , with the formula EMI2.1 gives an antinociceptive effect when administered by intrathecal injection. Guanfacine thus can be used to alleviate pain when administered intrathecally or epidurally. Guanfacine is known as an antihypertensive agent and is described in the specification and claims of US A 3 632 645, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.Guanfacine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof was administered alone or in combination with a local anaesthetic agent such as bupivacaine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.Examples of physiologically acceptable salts, which are used according to this invention are hydrochloride, lactate, acetate or sulphamate.Especially preferred physiologically acceptable salts are the hydrochlorides of guanfacine and bupivacaineThe present invention thus provides new pharmaceutical preparations containing guanfacine and a local anaesthetic agent, methods for preparing such preparations and methods for alleviating pain sensation wherein said pharmaceutical preparation or a preparation containing guanfacine alone as active ingredient is intended to be used in the post operative period or for the treatment of severe chronic pain. The pharmaceutical preparations are for spinal analgesia. They are preferably administered by intrathecal or epidural injection. In a preferred embodiment of this invention guanfacine is incorporated in a pharmaceutical preparation suitable for intrathecal injection.In a further preferred embodiment of this invention guanfacine is incorporated in a pharmaceutical preparation suitable for intrathecal injection together with a local anaesthetic agent, such as bupivacaine, lidocaine or tetracaine, wherein bupivacaine is especially preferred. A convenient route of administration of guanfacine is spinally i.e.intrathecally or epidurally, which will allow repeated administration over a long period of time. When administering the drug this way, a convenient way of restricting spread to segments more rostrally than intended, would be to make the solution hyperbaric by adding glucose to desired density or to add a vasoconstrictor such as adrenaline to the solution.The dosage of administration of guanfacine depends i.a. on the route of administration and the pharmaceutical formulation. A suitable dosage for obtaining analgesia by intrathecal administration is between 0.001 and 0.5 mg kg, and preferably higher when the preparation is administered epidural ly. Pharmaceutical preparationsIn clinical practice guanfacine will normally be injected intrathecally or epidurally. The preparations used are solutions which contain between 0.001 and 1 by weight of the active compound guanfacine, and between 5 10 by weight of glucose in order to increase the baricity of the solution. It is also possible to add a small amount of the vasoconstrictor adrenaline to the solution in order to restrict spreading.When guanfacine is combined with bupivacaine, the bupivacaine concentration is between 0.25 and 0.75 by weight. The preparations are made by dissolving the active ingredient or ingredients in a physiologically acceptable solvent.Example 1Guanfacine HC1 5 mg mlBupivacaine HC1 5 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 ml Example 2Guanfacine HC1 5 mg mlBupivacaine HC1 5 mg mlGlucose 50 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 3Guanfacine HC1 5 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 4Guanfacine HC1 5 mgiml Glucose 50 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 5Guanfacine HC1 5 mg mlBupivacaine HC1 5 mg mlAdrenaline 0.005 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 6Guanfacine HC1 0.01 mg mlBupivacaine HC1 5 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 ml Example 7Guanfacine HC1 0.06 mg mlBupivacaine HC1 5 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 8Guanfacine HC1 0.01 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 9Guanfacine HC1 0.06 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 10Guanfacine HC1 0.01 mg mlGlucose 50 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 11Guanfacine HC1 0.06 mg mlGlucose 50 mg mlSodium chloride 9 mg mlDistilled water ad 100 mlExample 7 is considered to represent the best mode of carrying out the invention known at present. Pharmacological testsThe antinociceptive effect of guanfacine may be established by the hot plate and tail flick test.Testing of tail flick was performed using an IITC Inc. Mod. 33 Analgesia meter commat , with the light focused on the tip of the tail d Amour, F.E.and Smith, D.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 72, 74, 1941 . The intensity of the beam was adjusted to give a reaction time of 3 4 sec. before intrathecal injection of the drug solutions. For the hot plate testing, a modification of the Eddy and Leimbach method Eddy, N.B. and Leimbach,D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 107, 385, 1952 was used. An IITC Inc. Mod.35 D Analgesiametere was set at a temperature of 58 0.2 C. The criteria for a pain response was licking of either of the hindpaws.We examined the pain responsiveness of male Sprague Dawley rats in a weight range of 300 350 g. The animals had an indwelling catheter in the spinal subarachnoid space, which was inserted via the cistern magna. The catheter was fixed at a surgical operation. The animals were kept in the animal colony in separate cages until testing took place 1 week after operation. The drug was administered in a volume of 15 jil, and testing of hot plate and tail flick reaction latencies took place at the intervals given in the tables. Animals given the combination of guanfacine and bupivacaine were not tested until the local anaesthetic effect of bupivacaine had disappeared, which normally took between 10 and 15 minutes. Guanfacine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof was administered alone or in combination with the local anaesthetic agent bupivacaine or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof. When guanfacine was administered together with bupivacaine first an initial phase of regional anaesthesia restricted to the hind legs and the lower dermatomes was obtained. When this effect had disappeared the animals were still non responsive in the hot plate and tail flick test for up to at least 7 hours after the injection, cf Table 2 below.

Thereafter, the same results were obtained as after guanfacine alone, i.e. the two agents appear to be additive in effects.As a comparison, the same volume of vehicle was injected, cf Table 3, and this was found to cause only very small and not significant changes in the reaction latencies. The vehicle used was a physiological solution of sodium chloride. Tests on miceAntinociceptive effects in mice were established in the following test.The effect 15 minutes after intrathecal injection of a volume of 5 pl containing different doses of guanfacine was established. The vehicle used was a physiological solution of sodium chloride.Table 4.Reaction latency was calculated according to the formula Antinociception lOOx test latency pre drug latency pre drug latencyThe values are given as mean S.E.M.

The accumulated reaction, i.e. the total time of licking on the injected paw, was measured during the 5 minutes after the injection of formaline. The results are expressed as mean accumulated response during 5 minutes in seconds f S.E.M. Each group consisted of 10 animals.Table 5. sec.
