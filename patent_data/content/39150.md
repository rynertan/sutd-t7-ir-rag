# Methods of and apparatuses for processing binary data.

## Abstract
Frame information is recovered from a stream of binary data formed at a transmitter 1 from a block of m x n informa tion bits comprising m groups of n bits plus m parity bits, one for each said group of n bits, these parity bits having then been scrambled by performing an exclusive OR operation in a gate 5 on each parity bit with a respective bit of an m bit parity scrambling code, said block of bits together with the scrambled parity bits forming a frame for transmission over a transmission link 3 . At a receiver 2 new parity bits are produced in a parity bit generator 9 at the incoming bit rate from the incoming stream of binary data by forming a new parity bit from each successive moving group of n 1 incom ing bits. The new parity bits are cyclically distributed to n 1 m bit shift registers 10,11,12,13 , and a framing signal is produced when one of the shift registers 10,11,12,13 holds m bits substantially corresponding to the m bits of the parity scrambling code.
