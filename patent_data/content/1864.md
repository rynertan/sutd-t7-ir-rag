# Novel 6 oxygenated 3,20 dioxo pregnane derivatives, process for the preparation thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Disclosed are novel 6 oxygenated 3,20 dioxo pregnane derivatives of the general formula I The other substituents of formula I include those commonly met in known corticosteroids. The novel compounds may be prepared by methods known per se. The 6 acyloxy compounds of formula I are preferably prepared by subjecting a corresponding 6 oxo compound of formula II, as herein defined, to esterification conditions. The 6 oxo compounds of formula I are preferably prepared by oxidation of the corresponding 6 hydroxy 6,7 dihydro compounds. The novel compounds exhibit anti inflammatory activity and are therefore useful in the treatment and control of inflammatory conditions.
