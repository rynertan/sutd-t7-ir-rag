# Electrical plug.

## Abstract
The plug comprises a base 1 with connection pins 3 which project from the front thereof and which are con nected via connection points 5 , to conductors 7 of a connection cable 9 . The magnitude of a pulling force to be exerted approximately perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the connection pins 3 between the cable 9 and the free end portion of one of the connection pins in order to change the position of this free end portion with respect to the base 1 is less than the tensile strength of the cable 9 this tensile strength is less than the force required for pulling a connection pin 3 out of the base 1 . Consequently, pulling of the cable 9 can never lead to a situation in which a loose connection pin 3 is left behind in a wall outlet.
