# AMYLASE NEGATIVE, ASPOROGENOUS MUTANT OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS USEFUL AS A HOST IN A HOST VECTOR SYSTEM

## Abstract
A biologically pure amylase negative asporogenous mu tant B. subtilis EE101 ATCC 39,096 is provided. This host, which contains no amylase coding gene, is particularly useful as a host in a host vector system for recombinant DNA work directed toward the production of improved strains of amy lase producing microorganisms.
