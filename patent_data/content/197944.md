## Description
The present invention relates to a system equipped with a radio frequency RF sensor to precisely control tracking satellite antennae which have wide angular fields of reception. This invention relates to the field of antennae, and more particularly to that of highly directional antennae, preferably for satellite applications. The invention also relates to the field of automatic beacon, or target, tracking systems. The problem of fine or precise pointing of highly directional antennae on board satellites has only in recent years been addressed by means of RF sensors incorporated in the antennae illuminators. The principle on which all RF sensors is based is that of an RF beacon signal transmitted by a ground station, which is received on board the satellite through a device i.e., the RF sensor capable of detecting angular displacements of the beacon signal s direction of arrival with respect to the sensor s electrical boresight. The most difficult problem to be solved with these systems is that of high pointing accuracy required in the presence of signal fade outs in the satellite to earth path, which may reach 35 dB in communication systems which use frequency bands in the 30 GHz range. A further difficult problem to be solved is the capability of providing the device with a non ambiguous self acquisition angle which is wide enough to enable rapid angular detection acquisition or re acquisition of the beacon signal s direction of arrival upon i loss of tracking due to failures in the satellite attitude control system, which permits coarse antenna attitude stabilization ii a temporary emission interruption of the ground transmitter generating the beacon signal or iii unexpected maneuvers of the satellite attitude control, which might cause unlocking of the auto tracking system. In fact, conventional systems are designed to enhance fine tracking capabilities, a peculiarity which is clearly incompatible with the capacity to re acquire the beacon signal over a wide angular field. As hereinafter described, the above mentioned problems will be illustrated with reference to the description of the operation of a conventional type of tracking system. The radio frequency sensor is a device providing at its output a measureable signal, such as a voltage, proportional to the instantaneous angular displacement between the beacon s direction of arrival, expressed in satellite coordinates, and the sensor s radioelectrical boresight. The angular displacements detected by the sensor are suitably processed and used in a position servo acting on the on board antenna to reestablish the correct alignment between the sensor s boresight and the beacon signal s direction of arrival. All known R.F. sensors for satellite applications are based on the well known monopulse technique, used for Radars. A monopulse sensor is capable of directly providing an RF reference signal, called the sum signal, and difference signals having an amplitude which increases with the angular offset between the signal s direction of arrival and the sensor boresight, and a phase angle which changes sign on crossing the boresight. As it is necessary to correct antenna position along two orthogonal axes parallel to the roll pitch axes of the satellite , the RF sensor provides two difference signals, each related to the axis to be controlled. These two difference signals, RF generated, are used to modulate the phase or preferably the amplitude of the sum signal which, after re modulation, contains information relevant to the instantaneous angular displacement between the direction of arrival of the beacon signal and the sensor s boresight. The re modulation technique is essential to achieve weight reduction, a basic requirement on board satellites. In fact, the technique of multiplexing on one communication channel two different items of information to be processed at a later stage requires that only one modulator demodulator unit be used. The detection of the two components of the instantaneous angle of error along the two orthogonal axes of the sensor is usually achieved by means of a phase locked loop receiver preceded by a signal amplitude normalizer consisting of an automatic gain control circuit which acts on the average value of the sum signal modulated by the difference signals. The sum signal Σ , amplitude modulated by the difference signals Δ , is coherently demodulated by mixing with the carrier, regenerated by the phase locked loop detector, and therefore cleared of the amplitude modulated component. It will be easily understood how the monopulse sensor system is implicitly limited in connection with its angle acquisition sector, and is therefore unable to operate outside a restricted angle where the difference signal provided by the RF sensor is of smaller amplitude than the sum signal. In fact, it is only within this range that the ratio Δ Σ may be linearized. In other words, the ratio is proportional to the instantaneous angular offset between the direction of arrival of the beacon signal and the sensor s radio boresight. Outside this area, there are threshold problems the sum signal being too low, in particular in the lower part of the beam lobe and in the sidelobes region , and rapid sign inversion of the angular discrimination function takes place, due to the periodic sign changes of the phase in the sidelobes region for both the sum beam and the difference beam. As a consequence, it is impossible to utilize the monopulse sensor for angle acquisition of the beacon starting from angle offset between beacon direction of arrival and instantaneous direction of the sensor s electrical boresight greater than the 3 dB sum beamwidth. This fact is well known in Radar techniques where the target tracking with monopulse can take place only following target angle designation by means of a surveillance, or acquisition, Radar which in practice performs the coarse angle acquisition function of the target. In satellite techniques, the angle acquisition or reacquisition capability starting from significant offset of the beacon from the instantaneous direction of arrival of the sensor s boresight is important for two reasons Although reinitialization of tracking may be achieved by remote control from the ground, some operational factors such as a the time required to deliver commands to execute an angular sweep of the acquisition field b the resulting outages and c the reliability of the procedure do not render this solution very attractive. Therefore, it is highly desirable to use a fine tracking system based on an RF sensor, which may acquire the ground beacon within an angle much larger than the 3 dB beamwidth of the antenna beam and such that it a may reduce, or eliminate, the requirement for interventions at the satellite control station, in particular for telecommands b may be able to minimize angle acquisition reacquisition times and c may minimize the downtimes of the telecommunication system, of which the fine tracking antenna system is an integral part. The system of the present invention eliminates the above mentioned drawbacks associated with the limited angle acquisition field typical of radiofrequency sensors used in the past, and is based upon To facilitate further discussion of the present invention, the following drawings are provided in which With reference to the figures, the functioning of the system which is the object of the present invention will be described. Figures 1 through 5 may be described in further detail as follows Figure 2 shows a schematic of the RF sensor illuminators and of ways of effecting sequential switching of RF signal samples received by the illuminators. Figures 2 Figure 3 shows a section, in U, V plane, of the radiation diagrams related to the A and B beams received by illuminators A and B of Figure 2a. Figure 4 shows alternative forms for the implementation of a lobe switching RF sensor using a number of illuminators greater than four. Figure 5 shows a schematic diagram of the demodulator 3 of Figure 1, where the elements listed below have the indicated reference numerals It must be borne in mind that the lobe switching type of sensor known in Radar applications is based upon an array of N elementary illuminators, the number of which is usually between 3 and 6, sequentially swept by a one way, N position switch. Referring again to Figure 4, two forms of implementation are shown Fig 4 a shows a 4 1 illuminator sensor, where the center illuminator E is added to each of the other peripheral illuminators A, B, C, D and Part b shows a 6 1 illuminator sensor where the six peripheral illuminators are added to the center illuminator G following selection made by a six position, one way switch. At the output Z of the one way, N position switch X, Figure 2 or at the output y of the summing circuit downstream from switch X in Fig. 4, we have a sequence of beacon RF signal samples picked up by the RF sensor s elementary illuminators. This sequence shows a discrete amplitude envelope modulation which approximately represents conical scan sampling. The resulting amplitude modulation is null only when the sensor s electrical boresight coincides exactly with the beacon signal direction of arrival. When the beacon signal is not aligned with the sensor s boresight, the N RF signal samples have different amplitudes and the amplitude of the signal will increase in a precise manner for the illuminator or illuminators which, in the focal plane of the optical system, are closer to the center of gravity of the diffraction figure produced by the optical system in the focal plane corresponding to the plane wave front arriving from the ground beacon, while the opposite happens for illuminators which are further away from such center of gravity. In a nutshell, the variation of the signal received by each elementary illuminator with the variation of the ground beacon s direction of arrival in relation to the electrical boresight of the sensor is the same as that of the antenna beam in relation to the illuminator Figure 3 . This is quite different from the monopulse sensor method, where the lobe switching sensor does not perform any manipulation of the received signal samples in RF, these samples being sent directly to level amplifier 11 Fig. 5 . The receiver used in the present invention is of the phase locked type with such locking band characteristics that it works in modulation tracking mode at least up to the frequency at which the one way, N position switch performs the time multiplexing of the N RF signals into the single receiver channel 12 Fig. 5 . This method of operation is essential for the correct functioning of the sensor over an acquisition angle range which is very large. In fact, if the phase loop band is sufficiently wide, the loop may reacquire a carrier phase correctly at the start of each signal sample coming from the time multiplexer. This implies that the phase information for the lobes of each antenna pattern is deliberately lost, and demodulation of the absolute value of the signal takes place at the output of the coherent demodulator Fig. 5 . In other words, the signal samples at the detector output all have a positive sign Fig. 6 . Figure 6 shows the equivalent effect of this type of detection over equivalent patterns relating to the elementary beams. The resulting effect is that of rectifying the sidelobes, which lose their sign. The present invention makes use of this characteristic behaviour of the single beam sidelobes envelope to achieve those performances of wide angle acquisition field which are claimed by the present invention. To this end, the angle discriminator functions, which are obtained by video processing of the sampled analog signals obtained at the output of the modulation tracking phase locked loop receiver demodulator 3, are set forth below, with reference to Figure 2 which shows one of the preferred implementations of the lobe switching type sensors As for the other implementations of the lobe switching RF sensor, such as those in Figure 4, we may define angle discriminator functions belonging to the family or, in other words, the discriminator function is given by the ratio of the linear combination, with coefficient K Figures 7a and 7b show an example of such characteristic behavior of the f The values taken by such function cause rotations of the paraboloid to take place by variable positive null or negative quantities, depending on whether the beacon is to the left, at the center or the right of the eye pattern shown in Figure 7a. By the same token, Figure 7b shows the variation of the level curves of the discriminator function in direction V. The function represented is which gives rise to paraboloid rotations by variable quantities along an axis which is orthogonal to the one above. To clarify how the concept may be generally applied, we may make reference to the case of a uniformly illuminated aperture. Assuming that the aperture is circular, having diameter a, and assuming that there are no random illumination amplitude variations, but that there may be phase ones, with a given correlation interval C, we may obtain for the square gain magnitude normalized to 0 dB for σ² 0 , the following expression where In the area close to the main lobe, the diffraction term is predominant and has a decreasing envelope the scattering term is, on the contrary, stationary. The scattering term does not provide any information on the direction towards which to move to reach the beam crossover point. Therefore, we may consider using the sidelobes for acquisition purposes, within a field defined in terms of u in which the diffraction term is larger than the scattering one by about 10 dB . The area of use of the diagram of a single beam will extend to u 31.4 N 10 , i.e., for the first ten sidelobes when c a 10 ² and σ² 0.1, an area in which the scattering term is negligible . The diffraction term may be represented, in terms of modulus and phase, for u 5, as follows and therefore the envelope, in dB, is The level curves of the discriminator functions, shown in Figure 7a and 7b, may have local stationary points. Figure 9 shows the points in plane u, v for which both components, which force the movement, are null i.e., local stationary points . Such points, which would be hypothetical candidates for steady state conditions, are not very troubling, as it is possible, by modifying the value of measurements A, B, C, D of formulae 1 and 2 , to cause antenna movements which give rise to a new set of initial conditions and therefore to the chance of getting close to the correct crossover point. As a matter of fact, through this trick, the acquisition paths become statistically oriented due to the average gradient in the area of sidelobes towards the desired crossover point. The measurement modification must be such as to not cause the beacon to leave the central area of the discriminator eye Figures 7a, 7b at a steady state. After a predetermined time from the start of the acquisition phase, this modification is stopped and the acquisition confirmation phase starts. Another essential component of the system and object of the present invention is the on board processor which interprets the demodulator output signals so as to recognize when acquisition takes place, to provide for switchover to tracking. To be brief, the task of the on board processor 4 is to perform comparisons between the voltage values obtained from the discriminator assuming this is software implemented and the thresholds set. When the processor recognizes, during comparison operation, that a low or null gradient area has been passed through which would lead to false angle acquisition , the processor initiates a sequential search procedure for the directions, with reference to the present position, for which the gradient increases. Then modifying commands are generated for antenna movement, and the antenna is then moved. This control is carried out even when the antenna reaches the desired tracking direction at the end of the angle acquisition procedure. Here, the angle gradient of the discriminator function is very high and is in any event known in advance. Therefore, the processor, while operating so as to modify parameters around the new stationary point, is capable of recognizing the high value of the gradient, comparing it with a predetermined threshold and therefore confirming the achieved acquisition of the desired ground beacon direction. As shown in flow diagrams 10, 11 and 12, the sequence of operations carried out by the on board processor is as follows During the acquisition confirmation time, the on board processor carries out other operations Figure 12 shows the flow of operations in the angle tracking mode. The blocks having the same name perform the same functional tasks as the operational modes described above for Figures 10 and 11 and the only new device which is put into service is circuit X, which carries out a comparison between error instantaneous voltage or any other quantity representative of the instantaneous voltage of the antenna tracking error and the preset threshold. If those thresholds are not passed, the system maintains its angle tracking mode, while passing these thresholds implies return to the angle acquisition reacquisition mode with a possible programmable delay . Figure 13 shows a typical path and Figure 14 gives a scenario for the different acquisition paths with different initial conditions in plane u, v. The effect of measurement perturbation will be noted in Figure 13, which shows up in the areas where the gradient is low. In those areas where the gradient is high, the perturbations on the measurements do not have much of an impact on acquisition trajectories. Perturbation therefore makes possible the exploitation of the sidelobe area, as shown in Figure 13, so that even starting from points far from crossover point by 1.2 , even with elementary beams of 0.3 , acquisition is made possible, as in the example referred to in Figures 2, 3, 7a and 7b. Concluding, as should be clear from the description, the invention herein described solves the following problems
