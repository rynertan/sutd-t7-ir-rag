## Description
This invention relates to an extrusion process for preparing brominated butyl rubber having a substantial fraction of the bromine in the primary allylic position. One of the first olefinically unsaturated synthetic elastomers to be commercially produced was butyl rubber. The expression butyl rubber is used in the rubber industry to describe copolymers made from a polymerization reaction mixture having therein from 70 to 99.5 by weight of an isoolefin which has about 4 to 7 carbon atoms, e.g. isobutylene, and about 30 to 0.5 by weight of a conjugated multiolefin having from 4 to 14 carbon atoms, e.g. isoprene. The resulting copolymers contain 85 to 99.5 by weight combined isoolefin and about 0.5 to about 15 combined multiolefin. The preparation of butyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,356,128. The polymer backbone of commercial butyl rubber is made up primarily of isobutylene units, with just a few percent isoprene units. The isoprene units contribute the small amount of unsaturation present in butyl rubber. The basic preparative equations are represented by which combine to form its main structure wherein n ℓ represents the number of isoolefin units incorporated in the butyl rubber, while m represents the number of diolefin units present, substantially as isolated units. The conjugated diolefin loses its diene unsaturation upon its incorporation into the polymer backbone. Thus butyl rubber, as presently produced, contains only a small percentage of unsaturation, in the form of the monoolefin structure associated with the isoprene residue which is incorporated more or less randomly throughout the polymer chain. Numerous references teach methods for halogenating various polymers. Generally, these references are limited to reactions in solution or are batch rather than continuous processes. There are, for example, references that teach the halogenation of butyl rubber, but each suffers from serious limitations. An early reference, U.S. Patent 2,944,578, teaches that chlorinated butyl rubber can be produced in a batch process by dissolving butyl rubber in a suitable, nonreactive solvent, e.g., hexane, and introducing chlorine or a chlorinating agent. By suitable control of the temperature, concentrations of chlorinating agent and rubber, and reaction time, chlorinated rubber containing the desired level of chlorine is produced. However, a batch process is inherently inefficient, and the need to dissolve the rubber in a solvent incurs significant expenses for solvent recovery and environmental control. An improved, continuous process for chlorination or bromination of butyl rubber was subsequently disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,099,644. However, that process still required the preparation and use of a solution of butyl rubber, which, in addition to the limitations noted above, is limited as to the concentration of rubber which can be processed, and which requires significant equipment and process control to precipitate the halogenated rubber from solution and then dry the rubber in a controlled manner so as to avoid degradation. The halogenation of ethylene propylene nonconjugated diene elastomers EPDM has also been disclosed such processes are analogous to those for halogenating butyl rubber. For example, U.S 4,051,083 describes the solution bromination and chlorination of EPDM using N halosuccinimide additionally, the neat halogenation of EPDM is also described. In the latter disclosure the halogenating agent is dispersed in the EPDM by blending on a cool rubber mill and halogenation is effected by heating the mixture in a hydraulic press. Halogenation of EPDM in an aqueous batch process is disclosed in U.S 3,896,095. The process employs the addition of an excess of Cl₂ or Br₂ to a polymer slurry to effect halogenation and avoid the expense of solvent recovery systems previously disclosed for solution halogenation processes. Chlorobromination of polymers such as polybutadiene, butadiene isoprene copolymers and natural or synthetic polyisoprene is disclosed in G.B. 1,483,063 and 1,483,064. The reaction is described as taking place at a low temperature of 0 15 degrees C, preferably in an inert solvent, and the halogenated products are described as containing high levels, e.g., at least 55 by weight of halogen. A close reading of these references indicates the difficulty with which halogenation of elastomers has been conducted prior to the invention disclosed herein. The various limitations of these batch and continuous solution processes are overcome by the improved process of the present invention. The possibility of producing a halogenated rubber such as halogenated butyl rubber continuously in an extruder reactor has been recognized, see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,185,057. However, the generalized disclosures of that reference do no more than acknowledge the desirability of such a process, but do not teach one how to accomplish such a process. The reference suggests that only enough chlorine be introduced into the extruder to react with the butyl rubber so that no chlorine remains after reaction. It then goes on to suggest that another gas, e.g., nitrogen, be introduced to effect the production of gas filled pores in the finished rubber, which is the primary object of the invention. No examples are disclosed in the patent and no conditions disclosed which would enable one to actually conduct such a butyl halogenation process. Chlorination of butyl rubber using dichloramine T and a calendar has been reported by Bulgarian workers Kh. Tenchev. et al, Chem Abstracts 50756u. The disclosed process was not intended to produce neat chlorinated butyl since calendering is carried out on a mixture of butyl rubber, accelerators, prevulcanization inhibitors as well as variable amounts of carbon black and dichloramine T. The halogenation, in a kneader or extruder, of polymers containing carboxylic acid groups using reagents that differ from those disclosed herein is described in U.S. Patent 3,364,187. The polymers are converted to the acyl halide derivatives using specific halogenating agents. The patent suggests that the kneading step may be carried out in an extruder, a Banbury mixer, a roll mill or any other apparatus that yields the described kneading action. A British Patent, 1,257,016, discloses a process for treating polymers with halogenating agents such as N bromosuccinimide under mechanical shear for the purpose of producing unsaturation. The patent mentions that halogenation may possibly occur in an intermediate step followed by dehydrohalogenation, but production and isolation of a useful halogenated product is not an objective, nor is it achieved. The process also requires the use of scavenging amounts of a metal oxide or carbonate such as magnesium oxide, zinc oxide or calcium carbonate in addition to the halogenating agent and olefin polymer. The patent discloses, as an alternate method, the preblending of the halogenating agent with a solution of the polymer followed by solvent removal. It is stated that very little, if any, reaction occurs during such an operation. An extensive disclosure of polymer modifications conducted in an extruder can be found in U.S. Patent No. 3,862,265. This patent is directed to modification of polyolefins using heat, shear and controlled pressure to induce degradation in the polyolefin and to combine the polyolefin with a free radical initiator and or one or more monomers. The broad disclosure is of value for its teachings directed to the modification of polyolefins with various monomers especially to form novel grafted polymers. Canadian Patent 1,121,956 describes the treatment of blow molded articles with fluorine gas to impart barrier properties to the article. It is achieved by introducing a mixture of fluorine and an inert gas into the interior surface of a parison before charging the parison into a blow mold the parison is then expanded by an inert gas under pressure. Such batchwise surface treatment method is not particularly relevant to the continuous whole polymer modification process disclosed herein. U.S. Patent 3,510,416 Vaccari et al teaches an improved method of halogenating PVC particles by using gaseous hydrogen in combination with a swelling agent chlorination carrier . Following reaction, the PVC particles are transferred to another piece of equipment a dryer in which the chlorination carrier is stripped and gaseous by products are separated. This reference discloses a process based on particle fluidization which relies on diffusion to accomplish drying in addition, such a process requires separate pieces of equipment and relatively long times for drying. Some polymers are particularly sensitive when exposed to shear and elevated temperatures in the presence of a halogenating agent. For example, butyl rubber is subject to degradation under such conditions and this has made the achievement of a halogenated butyl product using an extruder reactor a difficult goal, and, until the invention described at the end of this section, a goal that had not yet been achieved. The halogenation reaction of butyl rubber in solution is described in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Kirk Othmer, Third Edition 1979 , Volume 8 at page 476 ff. It is noted that the halogenation reaction carried beyond one halogen atom per olefin unit is complicated by chain fragmentation. Indeed, such fragmentation or degradation is a persistent problem when halogenation of butyl rubber is attempted that problem is aggravated under conditions of heat and shear. An additional difficulty in this field of polymer modification is the dehydrohalogenation reaction. One means of suppressing such a reaction is the addition of stabilizers which can be added, e.g., to a solution of halogenated butyl to protect against this reaction during processing. It is also necessary to avoid other undesirable side reactions which vary depending on the particular polymer being halogenated. Such reactions are further aspects of the sensitivity of the polymers to the severe halogenation reaction that has made the achievement of controlled halogenation of neat polymers in an extruder reactor a previously elusive goal. Other difficulties which are encountered in attempting to halogenate neat polymers include the problem of mixing a highly viscous polymer phase with a low viscosity halogenating agent phase e.g., where a gaseous halogenating agent is used this difference can be as much as ten orders of magnitude the low probability of the halogenating agent encountering the reactive site on the polymer, particularly when a low functionality polymer is employed e.g., butyl rubber, isobutylene isoprene copolymer and the difficulty of removing from contact with the polymer, i.e., disengaging, potentially damaging by products of the reaction, e.g., hydrogen halide. These problems and others have been overcome by the invention disclosed herein. The reactivity of the butyl rubbers and consequently their cure rate is substantially less than the high unsaturation natural and synthetic rubbers. In an effort to improve cure characteristics of the butyl rubbers, these synthetic polymers have been halogenated. Halogenated butyl rubber has contributed significantly to the elastomer industry. Some forms of halogenated butyl rubber, prepared in solution according to processes described above, are commercially available, e.g., chlorinated butyl rubber and brominated butyl rubber. One method used to prepare halogenated butyl rubber is that of halogenating butyl rubber in a solution butyl rubber cement containing between 1 to 60 by weight of butyl rubber in a substantially inert C₅ C₈ hydrocarbon solvent such as pentane, hexane, heptane, etc., and contacting this butyl rubber cement with a halogen for a period of up to about 25 minutes. There is then formed the halogenated butyl rubber and a hydrogen halide, the polymer containing up to one or somewhat more halogen atoms per double bond initially present in the polymer. Generally, halogenated butyl rubber comprises a copolymer of 85 to 99.5 wt. of a C₄ to C₈ isoolefin, e.g., isobutylene, with 15 to 0.5 wt. of a CH₄ to C₁₄ multiolefin, e.g., isoprene, containing at least about 0.5 wt. combined halogen in its structure. For example, where butyl is halogenated with bromine, the bromine can be present in the brominated butyl in an amount of from about 1.0 to about 3.0 wt. , preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.5 wt. . A method of preparing conventionally halogenated butyl rubber is described in U.S. Patent 3,099,644. The preparation, in solution, of halogenated butyl rubber containing both bromine and chlorine, i.e., bromochlorinated butyl rubber, is described in U.S. Patent 4,254,240. The potential for molecular weight breakdown of the butyl rubber, noted earlier, is present even where bromine chloride is used as the halogenating agent, as disclosed in this reference column 4, lines 24 32 . The structural formula for halogenated butyl rubber is typically represented as being where X represents the halogen and n, ℓ and m have the same values as described above for butyl rubber. This structure, however, is one of several which can be formed, depending on the conditions of halogenation, the halogenating agent, used etc. Other structural configurations which may occur in halogenated butyl rubbers are It will be noted that in each case the halogen is present as a secondary or tertiary allylic halogen. More recently, U.S. Patent No. 4,288,575 to Irwin Gardner which has an effective filing date of March 7, 1977 discloses a new structural configuration for the halogenated rubber where the rubber contains conjugated diene which is represented as In this structure the halogen, X, is in a primary allylic position. The method disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,288,575 for preparing these rubbers involves the use of a copper oxide catalyst useful for dehydrohalogenation of butyl rubber to form a conjugated diene rubber. As shown in Example 6 of the Gardner 575 patent this primary halogen is in a more stable configuration than the secondary halogens of the prior art and is not readily removed. The copper oxide catalyst was taught in Gardner s earlier U.S. Patent No. 4,145,492 to be a dehydrohalogenation catalyst suitable for the preparation of conjugated diene rubber. Table I of U.S. Patent No. 4,288,575 shows various halogenated conjugated diene containing polymers which are shown to have the halogen in the primary position. Not surprisingly, the residual halogen is always associated with substantial amounts of conjugated diene. Where high amounts of residual halogen are present in the polymer, as in Run A of Table I of U.S. Patent No. 4,288,575, it is the result of an initially high level of halogenation here 1.95 wt. bromine. Since the degree of rearrangement is proportional to the degree of dehydrohalogenation Gardner s polymers cannot be low in conjugated diene and at the same time have appreciable amounts of halogen present in the primary allylic position. In 1979 Van Tongerloo et. al. disclosed a brominated butyl rubber which was low in conjugated diene content if any and had the primary halogen configuration. The polymer is represented as having the structure. The reference states that the polymer was produced by a proprietary method and Van Tongerloo et. al. disclose only that rearrangement to the more stable primary configuration can be accomplished in brominated butyl rubber under a variety of conditions for example, in the presence of acid, free radicals, bases or heat. See Van Tongerloo, A. and Vokov, R., Van Tongerloo et. al. designate the methylene configuration of Formula VI above as EXO and the primary bromo configuration of Formula V as ENDO. It is alleged that even at ratios of ENDO EXO of 71 16 there is no clear indication of a correlation between vulcanizate properties and polymer microstructure. Hence, Van Tongerloo et. al. have not appreciated that the polymer which they purportedly made by an undisclosed proprietary process has any properties which are different than those of conventional halogenated butyl rubber. Subsequent to the making of the instant invention, Vukov disclosed that certain model compounds can be heated to 150 degrees C for 30 minutes to accomplish a molecular rearrangement as follows No substantial rearrangement of the chlorinated model was observed. See Vukov, R., Halogenation of Butyl Rubber and The Zinc Oxide Cross Linking Chemistry of Halogenated Derivatives which was presented to the ACS Rubber Division on October 25, 1983. Those skilled in the art will recognize that what is true about simple molecules model compounds may not necessarily be true about complex polymer molecules. Conventional processes, which halogenate polymers such as butyl rubber in solution, incur significant disadvantages. These include high capital investment for the equipment needed to handle, purify, and recycle the solvent, high energy costs for the movement, vaporization, and purification and recycle of the solvent, potential halogenation of the solvent, potential hydrocarbon emissions to the atmosphere and the use of considerable space for the equipment necessary to handle large volumes of solutions. U.S. Patent 4,384,072 discloses an improved halogenation process in which neat rubber was halogenated in an extruder. A significant feature of the earlier invention was injection of the halogenating agent at a position filled with rubber and subjecting the rubber and agent to a high degree of mixing. The invention disclosed herein is a further, significant improvement over such a process. According to the present invention there is provided a continuous process for the bromination of a butyl rubber polymer wherein the brominated polymer contains at least 1.5 wt bromine and at least 20 mole of the unsaturation in the unbrominated butyl rubber feed is brominated such that the bromine is in the primary allylic configuration, which comprises contacting a cohesive mass of butyl rubber polymer, said rubber being substantially free of acid scavengers, with a brominating agent at a temperature of greater than 120 C in a continuous flow device, under an acid environment, for a time sufficient to brominate the butyl rubber and cause a rearrangement of a substantial fraction of the contained bromine from a secondary or tertiary allylic configuration to the primary allylic configuration, said continuous flow device comprising means for conveying said polymer through said device wherein by product formed by the reaction of the brominating agent with the butyl rubber and any unreacted halogenating agent are disengaged from said brominated butyl rubber mass in said continuous flow device downstream of the contact between the butyl rubber and the brominating agent by means comprising deforming and disrupting said brominated polymer and injecting an effective amount of an inert gas thereby neutralizing said brominated polymer by disengaging bromination reaction by products and unreacted brominating agent. The process is preferably one wherein said polymer mass is subjected to deformation and disruption and wherein said polymer and said brominating agent are present during contact as co continuous phases or wherein said brominating agent is present as a continuous phase and said polymer is present as a discontinuous phase or wherein the region in which said polymer and said halogenating agent are contacted is filled with said polymer. The mole ratio of bromine in the polymer to initial olefinic unsaturation in the feed polymer is preferably at least 0.7 1 more preferably at least 1 1, most preferably about 1.25 1. Where a gaseous brominating agent is utilized the bromination is preferably conducted above the dew point of the brominating agent. In a preferred embodiment, the improved polymer bromination process is conducted in extruder reactor comprising a feed zone, a reaction zone and a neutralization zone. The extrusion screw must have sufficient clearance so that excessive shear of the polymer is avoided. This end is achieved by maintaining the ratio of the clearance between the screw flight and barrel to the radius of the screw at, at least 0.05. The brominated butyl rubbers produced by the process of this invention are more reactive than conventional brominated butyl rubber. As a consequence they form improved bonds when covulcanized with high unsaturation rubbers in sulfur cures. They therefore find particular application as inner liners for tubeless tires. Additionally, they have utility in applications in which conventional butyl rubber is suitable, e.g. inner tubes, mechanical goods, hoses, and electrical products. This invention relates to a process for preparing a brominated butyl rubber having improved cure and adhesion properties. More particularly it relates to brominated butyl rubber wherein a substantial fraction of the available bromine is present as a primary allylic bromine. In the practice of this invention butyl rubber is brominated in a continuous flow device under conditions which favor a rearrangement of the bromine in the polymer from the secondary or tertiary allylic position to a primary allylic position. This result is accomplished by carrying out the bromination in a reaction zone which is maintained in the acid state at a temperature in excess of 120 C. The butyl rubber copolymers useful in the present invention contain a major proportion, preferably at least 70 wt. , of isoolefins and a minor proportion, preferably not more than 30 wt. , of multiolefins. Copolymers of this general type, especially where the copolymer contains 85 99.5 preferably 95 99.5 of a C₄ C₇ isoolefin, such as isobutylene, with 15 0.5 preferably 5 0.5 wt. of a multi olefin of 4 14 carbon atoms, are commonly referred to in patents and literature as butyl rubber see, for example, the textbook Conventional high molecular weight butyl rubber generally has a number average molecular weight of 25,000 to 500,000, preferably 80,000 to 300,000, especially 100,000 to 250,000 and a Wijs Iodine No. of 0.5 to 50, preferably 1 to 20. More recently low molecular weight polymers have also been prepared which have number average molecular weights of from 5,000 to 30,000 and unsaturation expressed as mole , of 2 10. The viscosity average molecular weight Mv of commercial butyl rubber is 100,000 to 500,000, preferably 250,000 to 500,000. The isoprene utilized in the manufacture of butyl rubber is generally incorporated into the rubber in the following configuration the halogen is generally incorporated in a configuration depicted as wherein X is halogen. The site of unsaturation is external to the backbone of the polymer. In the butyl rubber polymers of this invention the halogen is incorporated in a structure having the configuration Throughout the specification and claims the configurations of formulas X, XI and XII will be referred to as Type I, II and III configuration respectively, the Type III configuration being the preferred structure of this invention. In carrying out the process of this invention the butyl rubber is contacted with the brominating agent in a continuous flow device. Suitable devices include kneaders, extruders employing single or multiple screws, e.g., twin screws , continuous mixers and a recently disclosed blending extrusion device referred to as a cavity transfer mixer see, e.g., The continuous flow device should be capable of initially forming the polymer feed into a cohesive mass and then deforming the polymer, disrupting the polymer surface, thereby exposing fresh, i.e., unreacted, polymer to the halogenating agent. The exposure of new surface does not necessarily require the use of high speeds where, e.g., an extruder is used. However, surface disrupting means are preferably employed as will be described in detail below , for example, pins, reverse flow sections, a Maillefer screw design, the cavities of a cavity transfer mixer, multiple flight screw section, interrupted flight sections, e.g., slotted flights, and combinations thereof. The deformation forces generated in the continuous flow device are adequate when such forces generate a degree of mixing of the polymer and halogenating agent such that the scale of segregation is, preferably, less than 50 microns, more preferably less than 30 microns, most preferably less than 10 microns. Characterization of the degree of mixing in a two phase system according to scale of segregation is described in the test, Principles of Polymer Processing, Z. Tadmor and C. G. Gogos John Wiley and Sons, 1979 , Section 7.5, pages 209 ff. The halogenation reaction of this invention can be carried out with the reaction zone of the continuous flow device being either filled or partially filled with butyl rubber. When the region in which the polymer and halogenating agent are brought into contact, e.g., the reaction zone of an extruder reactor, is not filled with polymer, the halogenating agent is present as a continuous phase and the polymer is present as either a discontinuous or continuous phase the former is preferred. When each constitutes a continuous phase, for ease of reference this is referred to a co continuous phases. In this latter situation if the reaction zone was viewed under conditions where deformation of the polymer was stopped, the polymer and halogenating agent would each comprise an independent, continuous phase. A preferred operating mode of the process utilizes a reaction zone which is only partially filled with polymer this permits reaction by products and unreacted halogenating agent to disengage from the polymer phase. Generally, the polymer is present in the reaction zone to the extent that 5 to 95 , preferably 10 to 75 , more preferably 15 to 50 , for example 20 to 35 of the reaction zone is filled with the polymer. One means of achieving a partially filled reaction zone is to feed, in a controlled manner, less polymer into the reaction zone than the conveying capacity of the zone. The space above the polymer is occupied by the halogenating agent and, as fresh surface is exposed to the halogenating agent and halogenation occurs, hydrogen halide is released as a by product of the reaction. The hydrogen halide disengages from the polymer and enters and is present in the halogenating agent phase. In a preferred embodiment, utilization of vent means in the reaction zone facilities removal of the reaction by product and unreacted halogenating agent. Another preferred embodiment imposes a vacuum on the vent means so as to more efficiently disengage by product s and unreacted halogenating agent. The vent means comprises one or more vents in the contacting region. Means are provided for contacting the halogenated polymer with neutralization means, for example a neutralizing agent. This can also be viewed as a means of disengaging unwanted reaction by products and unreacted halogenating agent from the halogenated polymer. The neutralization means and the halogenated polymer can be conveyed concurrently or countercurrently through the continuous flow device preferably in a neutralization zone following the contacting or reaction zone. The pH of the neutralized, halogenated polymer is, preferably, greater than 5.0, more preferably greater than 6.0. Preferably the various zones which have been described are separated from one another in such a manner as to permit maximum independent control of conditions in each zone. Details and conditions are described below for a preferred embodiment utilizing an extruder reactor, but the principles disclosed are broadly applicable to the system just discussed. A preferred embodiment of the process employs an extruder reactor. The extruder reactor may be thought of as carrying out the halogenated polymer manufacture in various operating zones The feed zone is designed to form the polymer feed into a cohesive mass and convey or pump the mass past a restrictive dam which follows the feed zone and distinguishes it from the reaction zone which follows. This operation should be conducted at low shear and temperature consistent with the desired result and at a pressure sufficient to convey the mass, typically up to 4.1 MPag 600 psig , preferably up to 2.8 MPag 400 psig , most preferably up to 1.4 MPag 200 psig . Lower pressures are preferred in order to avoid overheating the polymer. This can be achieved, e.g., by utilizing an extruder screw with relatively deep flights and by keeping the length of the feed zone, i.e., the feed zone screw length, as short as possible commensurate with desired production rates. For example, polymer is introduced at room temperature and exits from the feed zone at 60 to 150 C. A restrictive dam is used to separate the feed zone from the reaction zone which follows it so as to prevent back leakage of reactants. This dam is not restrictive enough, however, to cause excessive over heating of the polymer. A restrictive dam can be, for example, a reverse flighted screw section, a filled screw section, a shallow flighted screw section, an unflighted screw section, combinations thereof, or other means known in the art. If an unflighted screw section is employed, it can have a larger diameter than the root diameter upstream of it, for example 5 25 larger, but not greater than the screw flight diameter. The restrictive dam length should be about 0.5 to about 8 screw diameters, preferably 1 to 5 screw diameters, more preferably 1.5 to 4 screw diameters, most preferably 2 to 3 screw diameters in length. If a reverse flighted screw section is employed it can be single or multi flighted, preferably multi flighted. It should be noted that where the restrictive dam configuration employed is more than a mere separation boundary or region between zones, for example, more than merely an unflighted screw section, the restrictive dam can be considered to be part of the reaction zone itself, for example when a single or multi flighted reverse flighted screw section is employed. Under such circumstances, the restrictive dam in this region of the extruder reactor can be a part of or comprise the reaction zone. When the reaction zone is operated under vacuum, the restrictiveness of the dam between the feed and reaction zone can be reduced so as to permit some gas e.g., air flow into the reaction zone from the feed zone. In addition to the polymer which is introduced into the feed zone, an optional diluent may also be added. A diluent can function to reduce the viscosity of the polymer to a level commensurate with subsequent good mixing and halogenation without the necessity for excessive heat and a risk of molecular weight breakdown and undesirable side reactions it can also function to reduce the temperature of the polymer. The diluent may be volatile saturated hydrocarbon, chlorohydrocarbon or chlorocarbon such as pentane, hexane, methylene chloride, chloroform, or carbon tetrachloride. It may also be a non hydrocarbon, readily removable from the system downstream, but able to perform the function of temporarily reducing the apparent viscosity of the rubber in the reaction zone. Examples of suitable materials include water, inert gases such as carbon dioxide and air. The diluent may also be retained with or in the polymer, such as a hydrocarbon oil. Suitable oils include saturated aliphatic oil and rubber process oils such as paraffinic, naphthenic and aromatic types. Where such oils are utilized, the halogenated polymer would contain oil after recovery and drying and would commonly be referred to as oil extended. Oil extended rubber is well known in the art and various grades of oil extended EPDM, SBR, and polybutadiene made by other means are commercially available. Such products are particularly useful where it is desirable, for example, to extend the rubber with high levels of filler, e.g., carbon black or mineral filler, to obtain properties from high molecular weight polymer which might otherwise be difficult to process because of its inherently high viscosity, etc. The total amount of diluent, including that which may be present in the feed should not be greater than about 50 wt. based on the polymer, preferably less than 15 wt. , most preferably 5 to 10 wt. . The bromination process of this invention should be conducted so as to preferably brominate the rubber to the extent of at least one halogen atom per double bond of olefinic unsaturation originally present in the rubber. The mole ratio of bromine to olefinic unsaturation in the feed polymer is preferably at least 0.7 1, more preferably at least 1 1, most preferably about 1.25 1. In order to drive the reaction in the direction of the primary allylic Type III configuration the level of bromination in the polymer is at least 1.5 wt. . Control is required in order to avoid over and under halogenation. This can be achieved by, for example, controlling the halogen feed rate in comparison to the rubber feed rate, design of the reaction zone length, screw features and configuration, injection means, temperature, and RPM so as to determine time of reaction and to control the relative rates of the desired reaction versus competing side reactions e.g., halogenation of the olefinic unsaturation as for example the isoprene moiety in butyl versus the isobutylene moiety . The brominating agent can be gaseous, liquid or solid and may be added either in a pure state or diluted with a suitable inert fluid as noted above. Suitable brominating agents include sulfuryl bromide, 1,3 di bromo, 5,5 dimethylhydantoin iodobenzene bromide, bromine, bromine chloride, sodium hypobromite, sulfur bromide and N bromosuccinimide. Where gaseous bromine chloride is used, gaseous diluents, e.g., nitrogen, argon, air, CO₂, etc., can be used when a diluent is desired. At least under some conditions encountered in extruder halogenation, as, for example, where mixing butyl rubber and the halogenation agent are not as efficient as desired, the use of N bromosuccinimide may result in predominantly free radical reactions rather than the preferred ionic reactions. In this improved process alternative reaction zone mixing techniques are feasible. Injecting halogenating agent at a point or points filled with polymer can facilitate nearly instantaneous mixing. Alternatively the reaction can be allowed to occur at the continuously renewing polymer surface generated by the configuration of the reaction zone and conveying means, e.g., the extruder screw and barrel, in a reaction zone partially filled with polymer. Configuration of the screw and chamber walls should not be so restrictive as to cause excessive pressure and excessive shear heating of the polymer. Pressure at the point of injection need not be very high where the reaction zone is only partially filled with polymer and preferably vented. In addition, injection can be into the space occupied by the halogenating agent, e.g., the vapor space. A moderately positive injection pressure is suitable the pressure selected should maintain a positive flow into the reaction zone and prevent plugging of the line. The specific pressure chosen is a matter of operating convenience. In the filled system, pressure at the point of injection is about 103 kPag to 2.8 MPag 15 to 400 psig , preferably 689 kPag to 2.07 MPag 100 to 300 psig . Also important for achieving efficient reaction of the polymer and halogenating agent is the incorporation in the reaction zone of means to produce the level of polymer mixing and surface disruption preferred for the practice of this invention. As described earlier, this can be achieved, for example, by utilizing reverse flights on the reaction zone portion of the extruder screw or pins. Other means include operation of the screw at a rotation rate of about 50 to 600 RPM, preferably 70 to 400 RPM, most preferably 90 to 200 RPM, and by incorporation of a downstream restrictive dam, of the type described above, to separate the reaction zone from the neutralization zone which follows it. Characterization of mixing by reference to the scale of segregation achieved between the halogenating agent and polymer generally, any two phase system was noted earlier. A preferred scale of segregation in the practice of this invention is less than 50 microns, more preferably less than 30 microns, most preferably less than 10 microns. Overall, it is desirable, by control of polymer viscosity, chamber and screw design screw RPM and operating pressure, to prevent excessive temperatures in the reaction zone while maintaining high levels of mixing. The reaction zone is preferably maintained at a temperature above 120 C, to 190 C, preferably 125 C to 175 C, more preferably 125 C to 140 C. While, ordinarily, it is desirable to minimize the clearance between the extruder barrel wall and the screw flight such is not the case in the process of this invention. In the commercially used extruders the screw clearance is generally about 0.0254 cm 0.010 inches . In the practice of this invention the clearance can be about 0.122 to 0.635 cm 0.048 to 0.250 inches . The clearance can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the clearance between the screw flight and the inside of the barrel to the radius of the screw. This ratio should be at least 0.05, preferably the ratio is 0.05 to 0.333 more preferably 0.06 to 0.136, most preferably 0.08 to 0.130. In any event the maximum screw clearance should be 0.635 cm 0.250 inches regardless of the screw diameter. The pressure temperature relationship in the reaction zone is such that the brominating agent is preferably gaseous. This end is achieved by operating at a temperature pressure relationship which is above the dew point of the brominating agent. For example, where the brominating agent is bromine and the reaction zone is maintained at a pressure of about 689 kPag 100 psig the reaction temperature should be at least 130 C. See, for example, Yaws, Carl L., In a preferred embodiment of this invention neutralization is carried out in a water free environment, referred to in the specification and claims as dry neutralization, in which by product HBr is neutralized to prevent dehydrohalogenation of the halogenated polymer and to suppress other undesirable side reactions and corrosion of the equipment. Suitable means to effect neutralization and remove residual unreacted halogenating reagent in this improved process is the injection of an inert gas into the extruder to sweep out the by products and residual halogenation agent. This process is effected by employing process features such as those just described with regard to the reaction zone in order to disrupt the polymer surface and continually expose new surface to the inert gas in the neutralization zone. In a preferred embodiment vent means are provided in the neutralization zone to permit the inert gas and disengaged products to be swept out and immediately removed from the region near the polymer. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the screw configuration in the region of the vent comprises a deep, single flighted screw with little or no mixing occurring in the vicinity of the vent in order to avoid restricting the exiting flow of inert gas and disengaged materials. In another preferred embodiment various additives and or stabilizers are added to the polymer in the neutralization zone. As discussed earlier, multiple injection sites can be used as well as a supplementary injection zone. In another embodiment, pressure in the system is controlled in order to explosively remove the unwanted products. In one embodiment of the invention the neutralization zone is designed so that the inert gas contacts the reaction products from the reaction zone as soon as possible after the halogenation reaction in order to prevent dehydrohalogenation of the polymer. This is achieved by utilizing a dam between the reaction and neutralization zones which is as short as possible consistent with its functioning as a restrictive dam. The nature and configuration of various alternatives for the restrictive dam are described above in detail for the dam between the feed and reaction zones. The injection port for the inert gas can be located as close as possible to the downstream end of the dam or the neutralizing reagent can be injected so as to flow countercurrent to the flow of the halogenated product mixture. The term neutralization as used in the specification and claims encompasses both conventional neutralization using acid scavengers such as hydroxides and bicarbonates of alkali or alkaline earth metals, amines, etc. as well as the aforedescribed process in which a dry gas is used to sweep out bromination by products and brominating agents. Polymer stabilizing agents can optionally be added in this zone. This can be done by incorporating the stabilizers at an injection point. Suitable stabilizers for use in this process include slurries or solutions of butylated hydroxytoluene BHT , calcium stearate, sodium stearate, multi component stabilization systems such as those described in U.S. Patent 4,130,519 to Roper et al, and other degradation, oxidation and or dehydrohalogenation inhibitors well known in the art directed to the polymer being halogenated. In addition to the extruder reactor features just described, the process of this invention can also incorporate filter means known in the art to effect the separation of low viscosity wastes from the polymer stream while retaining the polymer in the extruder, screw means of suitable configuration, as described above, transversing zones A E inclusive to properly effect the operations disclosed in said zones including single and twin screws , a system for recycling any organic diluent that may be added to the feed zone and or included with the halogenating agent and, optionally, means for back mixing the extruded halogenated polymer to assure that the final, dried and packaged polymer is a homogeneous product. Materials of construction are a significant consideration in the process herein since potentially corrosive reagents are employed In addition to a concern for long equipment life, product stability needs to be considered if by products of the corrosion process become incorporated into the polymer. In addition, halogenation chemistry can be affected if metals and corrosion by products are present during the halogenation reaction. Materials of construction in the feed zone, reaction zone and neutralization zone are selected to prevent or minimize reaction of the equipment with the halogenating agent and the reaction by products. Small amounts of such materials may cause undesirable side reactions to occur with various constituents of the polymer. Useful materials include those alloys known commercially as Hastelloy Registered Trade Mark , steels coated with inert polymers e.g., fluorocarbons , ceramics, titanium, etc. Materials which have been found to be unsatisfactory include series 300 stainless steels, Monel, and carbon steel. Where dry neutralization is utilized other suitable materials include commercial alloys comprising nickel, cobalt, molydenum, chromium and iron as major alloying elements commercial alloys in this class include Hastelloy B C, Xaloy 306 Registered Trade Mark , Stellite 6 Registered Trade Mark and Triboloy Registered Trade Mark . Titanium coated steel is also useful. Following preparation of the halogenated polymer product in the extruder reactor, product is transferred to conventional polymer processing equipment for processing and packaging. This equipment includes rubber mills, extruders of various kinds, and balers. The brominated polymers of this invention can be processed in standard equipment used for each such polymer, such as internal mixers, mills, extruders, calenders. Said polymers are amenable to conventional compounding practice and various fillers and extenders can be incorporated, e.g., various carbon blacks, clays, silicas, carbonates, oils, resins, waxes, The brominated butyl rubber of this invention can be cured or vulcanized by any of the prior art methods suitable for such halogenated rubbers, e.g., using sulfur, sulfur containing curing agents such as sulfenamide derivatives, benzothiazyl disulfide, tetramethylthiouram disulfide, alkyl phenol disulfide. , zinc oxide alone or with various promoters, and mixtures thereof. Curing is usually accomplished at a temperature of from about 140 C to about 250 C, preferably 150 C to 200 C, and usually takes from 1 to 150 minutes. As has been described above, in order to achieve a maximum conversion of Type II bromine to Type III bromine primary allylic bromine it is necessary to carry out the halogenation in an acid environment. As used in the specifications and claims, the term acid environment means an environment which permits the HBr by product of bromination to contact the polymer and affect the catalyzation of the Type II to Type III rearrangement. Where the polymer contains basic materials which can react with HBr the rearrangement reaction is impeded. An acid environment is achieved using butyl rubber feed stocks which are substantially free of acid scavengers, that is compounds which will react with the HBr. Illustrative non limiting examples of such acid scavengers are epoxides, basic salts, hydroxides, phenates and amines, e.g., calcium stearate, ESBO. Furthermore, where the brominating agent is bromine or other agents which are gaseous at the reaction temperature the ratio of diluent, e.g. nitrogen, to brominating agent N₂ Br₂ should be minimized. Preferably the ratio is less than 2 1, e.g. 0 to 1.95 1. Additionally, where additives, stabilizers, processing aids and lubricants are added to the polymer in the scrubbing or exit zones the amount of acid scavenging material added, e.g. calcium stearate, should be 2 wt. or less, based on the weight of the polymer, preferably about 1 . A preferred stabilizer which can be added to the polymer in the scrubbing or exit zone is a blend of calcium stearate and ESBO an epoxidized soybean oil . The ratio of ESBO to calcium stearate is preferably 1 1 to 1.5 1, more preferably 1.25 1 utilized at about 1 wt. based on the polymer. In order to insure sufficient mixing of the polymer and residence time in the extruder the screw should have an L D ratio of at least 35, preferably 40 to 60 more preferably 40 to 50. The ratio of Type II bromine ie bromine in the secondary allylic configuration in which the site of unsaturation is external to the polymer backbone to Type III bromine ie bromine in the primary allylic configuration in the brominated butyl rubber is preferably less than 2 1, more preferably less than 1 1, most preferably less than 0.7 1. The Type III bromine generally will comprise at least 20 mole based on the moles of unsaturation in the unbrominated butyl rubber feed preferably 25 mole to 100 mole, more preferably 30 mole to 100 mole , most preferably 50 mole to 100 mole . In order to achieve the desired Type II Type III bromine ratio it is essential that the butyl rubber feed be substantially free of acid scavengers. As used in the specification and claims with reference to the butyl rubber feed stock, the term substantially free of acid scavengers means butyl rubber containing 0.5 wt. or less of such compounds. There is an interrelationship between the bromine content of the polymer and the amount of acid scavenger which can be tolerated in the feed. At bromine levels of about 3.5 to 4.0 wt. , the feed stock can contain about 0.5 wt. acid scavengers. At about 3 wt. bromine, about 0.4 wt. of acid scavenger can be tolerated. In general the lower the acid scavenger and the higher the bromine content of the polymer the higher will be the fraction of Type III bromine, i.e., Type II Type III ratio will be smaller. Ideally the butyl rubber feed contains no acid scavenger. The advantages of this invention will be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples. An extruder with 5.08 cm 2 inch diameter twin screws, counter rotating and non intermeshing was set up according to the teachings herein in order to halogenate butyl rubber isobutylene isoprene copolymer . The feed zone was 25.4 cm 10 inches long and separated from the reaction zone by a reverse flighted section. The reaction zone was 119 cm 47 inches long and separated from the neutralization zone with a fixed dam section. The reaction zone utilized forwarding single, double and triple flights with slots cut in several of the triple flights. Additionally, some forwarding single sections had mixing pins in the stem. The configuration in the reaction zone was designed to increase mixing, interrupt polymer flow and expose fresh surface to the halogenating agent. The halogenating agent was bromine gas diluted with nitrogen. Halogenating agent was injected at a slight positive pressure into the vapor space of the reaction zone at a point 10.16 cm 4 inches downstream from the beginning of the reaction zone at a rate of about 4 Kg hr. The reaction zone contains a vent located 94 cm 37 inches from the halogenating agent injection point and the vent was operated under positive pressure regulated in the range of 310 to 620 kPag 45 to 90 psig . Neutralization was achieved using nitrogen injected countercurrently, beginning 22.9 cm 9 inches from the end of the extruder at a rate of 1 to 4 Kg hr. A second vent was located 30.5 cm 12 inches downstream of the reaction zone vent. Polymer feed rate was targeted at 50 Kg hr. Four sets of runs were made A,B,C,D and samples taken about every 20 minutes during each run. A total of 23 samples were evaluated. The physical properties appear in Table I, and the cure and adhesion data appears in Table II. For each change in N₂ Br₂ feed ESBO central unsaturation sufficient time was allowed for the system to reach equilibrium before sampling. The discrepancy between CaSt₂ ESBO introduced and that found by NMR is apparently the result of conversion of the stearate to the acid form. It is evident that samples having Type III central within the scope of this invention have better NR Carcass adhesion 100 C and better self tack as well as carcass tack. Operating conditions for the runs described above appear in Table III.
