# Digital analogue converter.

## Abstract
A digital to analogue converter for use in a digitally recorded signal reproducing apparatus comprises a first con stant current source 5, 11, 12 42, 43, 44 , a switch 4 13, 14 45, 46, 47 for allowing the constant current of the first con stant current source to flow therethrough for a period corres ponding to the digital data, a second constant current source 26 36 55 60 generating a current flowing in the direction opposite to that of the current generated by the first constant current source, a switch 27 37 56 61 for allowing the current of the second constant current source to flow there through for a predetermined constant period, and an integ rator 7, 8, 9 , wherein the sum of the first and second constant currents is integrated by the integrator. The analogue signal outputted by the integrater has a center level in the vicinity of the ground potential level.
