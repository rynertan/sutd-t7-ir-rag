## Description
Device for drawing off and replenishing water in the boiler of an espresso coffee machine The present invention relates to a device for drawing off and replenishing water in a boiler of an espresso coffee machine. More particularly, the device is of the type where the drawing off and replenishing of the water are effected via a draw off cock and a filling cock placed respectively in an outlet pipe for water leaving the boiler and in an inlet pipeline for water coming from the mains supply to the boiler, the cocks being controlled to open simultaneously. As is known, when water is drawn from the boiler via the draw off cock, the replenishment of the boiler is simultaneously assured by a corresponding input of water from the mains supply via the filling cock. Although as a general rule the known devices currently in use have the advantage of avoiding rapid emptying of the boiler, they suffer from the drawback of not being able to guarantee a constant water level in the boiler. In fact with known devices, the water level will slowly increase during periods of high mains water pressure and will slowly decrease during periods of low mains water pressure. In the first case, after the boiler has been operating for a certain period it becomes completely flooded with water, which results in the so called steam service being compromised in the second case water drains completely from the boiler, giving rise to the possibility of overheating and burnout of the electric resistance elements which become exposed. In the known coffee machines currently in use the operator has, therefore, to keep a strict check on the water level in the boiler so that he may take action as necessary by opening the draw off cock, or the filling cock until the water level in the boiler is brought to the desired value. The,devices in use are therefore scarcely reliable in tha,tthey require periods of corrective intervention on the part of the operator, failing which the drawbacks cited above could be experienced. The problem forming the basis of the present invention is that of devising a device of the specified type which has such structural and operational characteristics that the said drawbacks may be overcome. The innovative idea forming the basis of the present invention lies in reducing the pressure of the water coming from the mains supply and in maintaining this reduced pressure constant at a value having a predetermined relation to the boiler pressure, for example at a value which is double the pressure of the water in the boiler regardless of pressure variation in the mains supply. Thus,according to the present invention there is provided a device of the aforesaid type, characterised in that it comprises a first throat disposed in the outlet pipe and having a resistance set in accordance with a desired outlet delivery of water a second throat disposed in the inlet pipe and having a resistance which is in predetermined relation to that of the first throat and a valve disposed in the inlet pipe upstream of the second throat, and including a valve body and a slider which is movably guided in this body and defines therewith a restricted port for the passage of water to the boiler, said slider having a first portion which is so subject to the pressure of the water upstream of the second throat that the slider is urged by this pressure in a direction to reduce the size of said restricted port, and a second portion which is so subject to the pressure of water in the boiler that the slider is urged by this pressure in a direction to increase the size of said port, the relative areas of said first and second portions being such that with both cocks open, the slider takes up an equilibrium position in which the said port is so sized that the water pressure immediately upstream of the second throat assumes a value which is in predetermined relation to the boiler water pressure and results in the flow through said second throat equalling that through the first throat. Further characteristics and advantages of the device according to the present invention will become apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment given by way of non limiting example with reference to the single attached figure which shows a sectional diagrammatic view of a device according to the present invention. With reference to the attached figure, by 1 is indicated in its entirety a device for drawing off and replenishing water in a boiler 2 of a machine for the production of espresso coffee, this machine is not shown as it is of conventional type . The boiler 2 is provided in a conventional manner with heating means, not shown, for heating the water contained therein and for the production of steam.The boiler 2 is traversed by one or more coffee units 3, of conventional type, for the production of espresso coffee. The boiler is provided with a water outlet pipe 4 for drawing off hot water, and a water inlet pipe 5, fed from the mains supply, for filling the boiler. The device 1 comprises a draw off cock 6 placed in the outlet pipe 4, and a filling cock 7 placed in the inlet pipe 5. The said cocks 6 and 7 are substantially alike. In particular each cock comprises a valve body 8, 9 a fluid duct 10, 11 in this body 8, 9 a valve seat 12, 13 and a valve closure member 14, 15 movable to and away from this seat 12, 13. The valve closure member 14, 15 is urged in the direction of closure by a spring 16, 17 and is displaceable in the direction of opening, against the force of the spring 16, 17 by means of a push rod 18, 19. Hand operated means, shown diagrammatically by 20 and of known type, are provided for simultaneous control of both push rods 18, 19 to thereby effect the opening of both the cocks 6 and 7. The device 1 further comprises a first throat 21, placed in the outlet pipe 4, downstream of draw off cock 6, as well as a second throat 22, placed in the inlet pipe 5, downstream of filling cock 7. The throats 21 and 22 are adjustable. In particular the resistance of the throat 21 is adjusted in accordance with a required outlet delivery of water, whilst the resistance of the throat 22 is adjusted so as to equal the resistance of the throat 21. The device 1 further comprises a valve 23, placed inthe inlet pipe 5 upstream of the throat 22 and the cock 7, and intended to reduce the pressure of the water drawn from the mains supply and keep the value of this reduced pressure constantly equal to double the pressure of the water in the boiler. The valve 23 comprises a valve body 24, which preferably forms a single body with the bodies 8 and 9 of the cocks 6 and 7 a seat 25 is defined in the valve body 24 and is constituted by three consecutive coaxial cylindrical sections 26, 27 and 28 which have respective cross sections of decreasing area, A7, A2, A3. The section 28 of least area opens into a cavity 29. The area Al has double the value of area A2. A slider 30 is movably guided in the valve seat 25 and is formed by three coaxial cylindrical sections 31, 32, 33, which respectively slide in sealed fashion in the sections 26, 27 and 28 of the seat 25. The slider 30 is coaxially provided, in correspondence with its section 33, with an appendage 34 which has a mushroom shaped end 35. The end 35 extends into the cavity 29 and defines with the edge 28a of the section 28, a restricted port 36 which provides an outlet into the cavity 29 for water passing along a water course 37 extending through the section 28 and the cavity 29 between an inlet orifice 38 and an outlet orifice 39. This restricted port brings about a reduction in pressure in the water supplied from the mains supply. Defined between the slider 30 and the valve body 24, are a first annular chamber 40 having an area equal to A2 A7, a second annular chamber 41 having an area equal to Al A2, and a cylindrical chamber 42 having an area A1. The first annular chamber 41 is in fluid communication with the cavity 29 via a duct 43 the second chamber 41 is in communication with the atmosphere the chamber 42 is in fluid communication with the boiler through a duct 44 and the section of the pipe 4 which is upstream of the throat 21. In this manner the slider 30 has a first portion 30a formed by its end facing the chamber 32 and having an area Al urged by the pressure of the boiler in a direction which causes an increase in size of the restricted port 35, as well as a second portion 30b formed by the mushroom shaped end part 35 and by the part facing the chamber 40, of overall area equal toA2 urged by the pressure downstream of the port 36 in a direction which causes a reduction in size or the said port. The operation of the device is described below with reference to the condition where cocks 6 and 7 are both open. In this condition the water flows through pipes 4 and 5 in the direction of arrow f. The water drawn from the mains supply at a pressure of Plains passes through the restricted part 36 so that its pressure is reduced to a reduced value Pr. In the steady state equilibrium of the slide the reduced pressure Pr is of a value equal to double the pressure of the boiler, P Pboiler regardless of the main supply pressure. The water drawn from the mains supply then passes through the throat 22, upstream of which the pressure equals 2. Boiler Since the change in pressure across the throat 22 equals Pboiler and is therefore equal to the value of the pressure across the throat 21, and since the resistance of the throat 22 is so adjusted as to be equal to that of the throat 21, it therefore follows that the water flow replenishing the boiler is equal to the water flow which is being drawn off therefrom. When the pressure of the water in the boiler varies, or the pressure of water from the main supply varies, the slider 30 will be displaced in the valve body 24 until it reaches a new position of equilibrium in which the new size of the restricted port 36 is such that it sets and maintains the reduced pressure at a value double that of the boiler pressure. The main advantage of the device according to the invention lies in the fact that it guarantees maintenance of water level in the boiler even after numerous and prolonged operations of drawing off water and even when there are variations in the mains supply pressure and the pressure in the boiler.
