# Task lighting system.

## Abstract
A task lighting system including a reflector 44 which supports a light source such as a fluorescent light tube 52 . An at least translucent member 54 covers the light source and extends along its entire length. A variable light transmis sion pattern 64 is carried by the member. The light transmission pattern has a density which is directly pro portional to the brightness levels of the light source, both longitudinally and circumferentially thereof. The variable light transmission pattern is defined by a plurality of opaque markings and is positionable within the reflector so that the light source has an apparent uniform brightness. The variable light transmission pattern controls veiling reflec tions which can occur when an observer views a task having given specularity. The member is movable with respect to the light source to vary the brightness of the luminaire.
