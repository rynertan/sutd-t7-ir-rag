# Pressure sensor.

## Abstract
A pressure sensor of high sensitivity and high precision comprises a membrane region diaphragm 3 provided in a part of a semiconductor body 1 , at least one pair of pressure sensing semiconductor strips 4 formed in a major surface of the membrane 3 , made of p type diffused layers and arranged in a direction of great piezoresistive coefficient, a semiconductor region 10 electrically interconnecting ends of the pressure sensing semiconductor strips 4 on one side, made of a p type diffused layer and arranged in a direction of small piezoresistive coefficient, and electrode lead out semiconductor regions 9 electrically connected to the other ends of the respective pressure sensing semiconductor strips 4 , made of p type diffused layers and arranged in a direction of small piezoresistive coefficient.
