# A passive temperature control system.

## Abstract
A passive temperature control system includes an instrumentation housing 21 in which a solid heat absorbing material 23 is located. Heat transfer to the interior of the housing 21 is absorbed by the heat absorbing material 23 through a change in phase from solid to liquid. The tempera ture within the housing is controlled by the melting tempera ture of the heat absorbing material 23 until the solid heat absorbing material 23 melts.

## Description
A PASSIVE TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM This invention relates to a system for the passive temperature control of Dorehole logging instruments and more particularly to means for housing instrumentation such as electronic equipment and nuclear radiation detectors so as to provide a control of tne operating temperature for such instrumentation during logging operations under increasing borehole temperatures with depth. Various apparatus have been utilized in the well logging art to control the temperature of downhole logging instrumentation.Borehole temperatures can rise to as much as several hundred degreesFahrenheit. One such apparatus is the Borg Warner HT 75 thermoelectric refrigerator. This is a solid state device which eliminates the need for a compressor, refrigerant fluids or piping.Electronic thermoelectric modules along with natural convection fins are used to cool downhole instrumentation and dissipate heat to the ambient air. In situations where cryogenic temperatures must be maintained, liquid nitrogen and frozen propane have been used to provide cooling. For temperatures above 1000F 38or alloys of bismuth have been used to absorb heat, a common example being an alloy of bismuth, lead, tin, and cadmium that melts at 1580F 700C . In accordance with the present invention there is provided a passive temperature system for housing temperature sensitive instrumentation comprising a an insulating housing, b heat absorbing material located within said insulating housing for absorbing heat transferred into the interior of said housing through a change in phase from solid to liquid and c means for containing said heat absorbing material as heat is absoroed thereoy and the solid material begins to change to the liquid state. Using the system of the invention, any heat transferred through the insulating housing to the interior of tne housing, wnich also accommodates tne temperature sensitive instrumentation, is absorbed through a change in phase of the heat absorbing material from solid to liquid state. The heat absorDing material can maintain its melting temperature within the housing under exterior temperatures up to 4000F 204or until the heat aDsorbing material has melted. In the accompanying drawings, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate first and second examples of the passive temperature control system of tne present invention. FIG. 3 illustrates a borehole logging system employing the temperature control system of FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 1, the system includes a vacuum insulating flask 20 which is located within the housing or pressure shell 21 of a borehole logging tool. The instrumentation 22 to be protected against rises in temperature is placed within the inner chamber 25 of vacuum flask 20 which is closed by an insulating plug 26. The flask 20 reduces the flow of heat into the interior of the flask, but any heat which does reach the interior of the flask is absorbed by a heat absorbing material 23 through a change of phase of the material from solid to liquid. The temperature within the flask is controlled by the melting temperature of the heat aDsorbing material until such material melts.In remote applications, such as the well logging operation of FIG. 3 wherein a subsurface formation 6 is logged with the borehole logging tool 5 and logging cable 7, the temperature control system shown has the specific advantage of being passive, that is, requiring no electrical power input. A particularly suitable heat absorbing material is gallium, a metal that melts at 860F 300C , has a heat of fusion heat required for melting of 19 calories per gram, and has a density of 5.9 3 grams cm . These properties make it ideal as a compact neat absorber for use herein. The gallium, or other suitable heat absorbing material, is contained in a metallic container or containers 24, conveniently formed of copper, to facilitate heat transfer into the gallium and to hold the liquid when the solid gallium begins to melt. In one experiment a vacuum flask, four feet 1.22 m long with an internal diameter of 2.4 inches 6.1 cm , housed one kilogram of gallium contained in copper cylinders. A temperature of up to 3920F 2000 C was applied to the outside of the flask.The internal temperature remained Delow 900F 320C for five hours due to tne melting of the gallium. Materials other than pure gallium which are suitable for use as heat absoroers in borehole logging operations include alloys of gallium with indium and tin which melt at 500F 100C and 800F 270C respectively , glycerine which melts at 650F 180C , and ice which melts at 32OF ooh . In an experiment using 380 grams of ice in the same vacuum flask used with gallium, the internal temperature of the flask remained below 400F 40C for seven hours in the 3920F 20000 environment. In the second example shown in FIG. 2, the heat absorbing material is in the form of a lining 30 in the inner wall of the flask 20 and is held in position by a metallic liner 32. In a further embodiment not shown the flask 20 and liner 32 of the second example may be replaced by a double walled housing with the heat absorbing material contained within the double walled housing. It will be appreciated that additional blocks of heat absorbing material may be placed in containers such as shown in FIG. 1 or placed in the inner chamber 31 of FIG. 2 to give added heat absorbing capability.
