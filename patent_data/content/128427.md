# Semiconductor memory having circuit effecting refresh on variable cycles.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor memory using a dynamic memory device 24 , a battery 17a . . . 17c supplies a power source voltage and a substrate bias voltage when the memory is cut off from an external device, and a refresh control circuit 22 changes the refresh timing of the memory device 24 in accordance with the leakage current of the memory device 24 . The power consumption of the memory can thus be reduced and the data can be kept for an extended period without an external power source.
