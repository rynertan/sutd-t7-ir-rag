# SAMPLING METHOD AND DEVICE

## Abstract
This invention concerns a sampling method and device for small quantities of liquid sample in chromatographic analytical systems. This method includes the formation of an aerosol by dispersion of the liquid sample in a gas at predetermined dilution ratio the drawing of the whole sam ple or part of it and the introduction of a measured amount of the drawn aerosol into the chromatographic analytical system. The aerosol must be stable until its introduction into the chromatographic system and can be formed in a con tinuous or discontinuous way inside a closed container or in an open conveyor.
