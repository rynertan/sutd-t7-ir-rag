# Geodesic optical component.

## Abstract
A geodesic optical component is described which con sists of a light guiding layer on a substrate in which there is a surface corrugation which corrugation determines the func tion of the component. Since the surface corrugation 7 has a wavelike character, it is possible while maintaining the desired optical function to limit the maximum depth 9 or height 8 of the corrugation, so that it can be produced using inexpensive pressing or etching techniques.
