# Electrophotographic toner.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process in which a spherical electrophoto graphic toner containing a colorant and having a particle size suitable for the electrophotography is directly formed in the polymerization process for formation of a binder resin. If a reac tion medium capable of dissolving a monomer but incapable of dissolving a formed polymer is used and polymerization is car ried out in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator in the state where the monomer, the colorant and other additives are dissolved or dispersed in the reaction medium, an elec trophotographic toner having a desired particle size is ob tained. According to this process, the particle size of the colored resin is stably controlled to 1 to 30 um suitable for a toner in the polymerization process, and the particle size distri bution is very sharp.
