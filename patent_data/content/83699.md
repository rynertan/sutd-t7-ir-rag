# PROTECTIVE CIRCUIT FOR SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

## Abstract
An input pad overvoltage protective circuit for integrated devices is disclosed. It enables both positive and negative polarity input signals be applied to a protected gate 14 of an FET 11 . The protective circuit comprises a first resistor 12 coupled between an input pad 13 and the gate 14 and a current limiting second resistor 15 and diode 16 coupled between the pad and a reference potential.
