## Description
Tooth paste This invention relates to a new tooth paste. The tooth paste is a new agent for cleaning teeth based on the principle that no strong abrasive is required, nor any brushing with a hard toothbrush.The plaque layer should instead be removed by means of dissolution. All known teeth cleaning principles for individual use are based on the principle of toothbrushing, i.e. that the teeth must be brushed to be clean by means of a tooth cleaning agent containing rather strong abrasives, such as chalk, phosphate, bicarbonate etc. Usually the cleaning ability of these agents is totally related to the grinding ability of the abrasive. In course of time the use of strong abrasives combined with hard nylon brushes has been found to cause microscopic scratches in the dental enamel which, in its turn, increases the possibility of a layer of plaque being built up again as these scratches increase the possibility of fixation to the teeth surfaces. Moreover, damage to the necks of the teeth will arise due to wear, which results in hypersensibility.The method of brushing teeth is also a matter of dispute, and parts of the plaque layer and abrasive can be easily brushed down into gingival pockets if an erroneous technique is used, which causes minor infections and inflammations resulting, in its turn, in paradontosis with loosening teeth as a consequence. Today s tooth paste is much built on the fact that the individual should feel a fresh taste in his mouth. This has the negative effect that you will have the false feeling of being clean in your mouth. Therefore toothbrushing will be incomplete. As a consequence of this many expert dentists and researchers are of the opinion that today s toothpaste is of a dubious value. Most dentists desire a tooth paste not causing abrasive damage but facilitating removal of plaque. Now it has been found that plaque can be removed by means of this new tooth paste, another tooth brushing method preferably also being used. The tooth paste is characterized by a hydrocarbon free of halogen, an emulsifier, a tenside, a thickener and water, in which the content of hydrocarbon is 1 10 by weight the content of emulsifier is 1 10 t by weight the content of tenside is 1 5 by weight, and the content of thickener is 0.5 5 by weight and optionally moisture retaining agent in an amount of up to 30 t by weight and optionally other current additives to tooth paste, such as abrasives and flavouring agents, the rest consisting of water and the content of hydrocarbon and emulsifier being of substantially the same order of magnitude and the hydrocarbon being present in solubilized and evenly distributed state in the tooth paste in form of gel.The hydrocarbon free of halogen, i.e. non halogenous hydrocarbon has preferably an isoprenoid structure and the best results have been achieved with monocyclic terpene, above all limonene. Of course the hydrocarbon free of halogen can contain minor amounts of other substances which do not influence its function without the scope of the invention therefore being exceeded. The emulsifier is preferably a nonionic emulsifier and the tenside is preferably amphoteric. Besides, small amounts of alkali fluoride, such as sodium fluoride, flavouring agents aromes , preservatives etc. can be included in the tooth paste of the invention. Their amount is totally usually below 5 Co by weight, conveniently below 2 t by weight and preferably about 1 t by weight. Hydrocarbons with an isoprenoid structure are e.g.ocimene, myrcene, D limonene, a terpinene, B terpinene, X terpinene, 6 carene, sabinene, a pinene and camphene.The monocyclic terpenes and above all limonene are most suitable among these. Saturated hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, e.g. pentanes, octanes, decanes, can also be used. The tooth paste according to the invention is rubbed onto the teeth surfaces and between the teeth without addition of water. Tooth paste can be applied to the surfaces between the teeth by means of toothpicks and or by pressing the liquid in the mouth between the teeth. Accessible teeth surfaces are then rubbed again with a brush, after which the mouth is rinsed a few times with hot water. The effect of the tooth paste can be explained by the fact without this explanation being binding for the invention that fats and lipides included in the plaque are dissolved and absorbed in the halogen free hydrocarbon.The plaque will not be rubbed about on the teeth surfaces, which is done at cleaning according to known principles. It is known that plaque consists of lipides, polysaccharides and proteins and that these lipides are a prerequisite of calcification of plaque tartar . Therefore it is important that these lipides are effectively removed from the tooth surface. Addition of a very weak abrasive to the present tooth paste accelerates plaque removal as well as rubbing with a soft toothbrush. It seems as if the droplets of halogen free hydrocarbon in the toothpaste will be transformed into larger drops, which are more capable of dissolving the lipide in the plaque. As small an amount of water as possible should be present at cleaning. At a substantial plaque layer you can leave the tooth paste a little longer 1 2 min. on the teeth surfaces before the mouth is rinsed with lukewarm water. The present tooth paste can be diluted with water without the lipides included therein migrating from the halogenfree hydrocarbon. In this way they can be carried away with the tooth cleaning agent. The other parts of the plaque layer such as proteins and polysaccharides are broken up by the cleaning agent. The content of tensides is then likely to accelerate said breaking up. Proteins and polysaccharides included in the plaque layer then migrate into the tooth paste and are carried away with this in its water phase when the mouth is rinsed. In principle any hydrocarbon free of halogen might be used in the present tooth paste. However, it is preferably a liquid at usual temperature and body temperature. Moreover, it should of course be nontoxic and preferably such hydrocarbons can be used as are allowed in foodstuffs. It has been found that monocyclic terpenes provide the best result both in respect of plaque removal and tolerance. As monocyclic terpenes in a useful non purified form citrus oils lemon oil may be mentioned and as an example of clean monocyclic terpene limonene. As emulsifiers nonionic surfactants can be used, which should preferably be completely soluble in the used fat dissolving substance. These should also be permitted for use in foodstuffs. As examples polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate TEEN 602 , polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate TWEEN further polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate, mono laurate and myristate, sorbitan monostearate, monooleate and monopalmitate can be mentioned. Of these compounds the corresponding di and tri mers can also be used as ell as such as are mixed with fatty acid groups. Other useful emulsifiers are glycerol mono , di and tri fatty acid esters. Polyoxyethylene stearyl ether as well as the corresponding lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl and oleoyl homologues are also useful.Polyoxyethylene fatty alcohols of the same homologue series are also useful. Most suitable as tenside is a so called balanced, amphoteric compound preferably imidazoline derivatives are used here. The ampholytic amphoteric tenside can preferabl be a tenside in the following groups of tensides EMI5.1 wherein R is the acyl radical of a fatty acid with, on an average, 11 19 carbon atoms, conveniently 13 17 carbon atoms, preferably 14 16 carbon atoms, R1 is CH2 COOM or M, Z is COOM, CH2COOM or CH CH2SOJM. OH and M is an alkaline metal, H or the radical of an organic base, preferably an amine, which can be a eterocyclic amine or a triloweralkyl amine or a triloweralkanol amine, e.g. triethyl amine or triethanol amine.EMI5.2 wherein R2 is the acyl radical of a fatty acid with, on an average, 12 18 carbon atoms, and x is an integar of the value 1 4, preferably 2 3.EMI6.1 wherein R is an alkyl group, conveniently with 12 18 carbon atoms, preferably a mixture of 12 18 carbon atoms. 4. Rug R3 NH CH2 x NH CH2 COO wherein R is an alkyl group with, on an average, 8 18 carbon atoms, conveniently 10 14 carbon atoms, preferably 12 carbon atoms, and x is an integer of the value 1 4, preferably 2 3. To sum up, these different groups of tensides 2 4 can be written asEMI6.2 wherein R2 is an alkyl group, conveniently with 12 18 carbon atoms, preferably a mixture of 12 18 carbon atoms or an alkylaminoethyl or alkylaminopropyl group with 8 18 carbon atoms, conveniently 10 14, preferably 12 carbon atoms also a mixture with 8 18 carbon atoms is possible, or an acylaminoethyl or an acylaminopropyl group, where the acyl group has 12 18 carbon atoms on an average, preferably a mixture of 12 18 carbon atoms, and where R4 and R5 either both are metyl groups or where R4 is H and R2 an electron pair. However, it is also possible to use anionic tensides, e.g. sodium lauryl alcohol sulfate and sulfonate and their homologues with respect to the number of carbon atoms in the fatty alcohol. Also nonionic tensides can be concerned, the polyethoxylic chain having a varying length. Quaternary tensides are also useful. The thickener consists preferably of carboxymethyl cellulose, a cellulose ether or a microcrystalline cellulose. Other useful agents are polyglycols, alginate and alginic acid propylene glycol ester, gelatine starch and so called mucilage , e.g.carrageenin, sterculia gum and tragacanth. Moreover, the tooth paste contains preferably a water binding agent moisture retaining , a so called humectant which is a usual constituent in all toothpastes. A suitable addition is 5 30 Co by weight of the tooth paste, preferably 10 20 t by weight.Suitable moisture retaining agents are glycerol.However, e.g. propylene glycol and sorbitol and other polyalcohols are also useful. Abrasives optionally used should also be mild and a suitable abrasive is a fine granular silicon dioxide, e.g. that sold under the name of CAB o SIL . The tooth paste can also contain a fluoride, such as sodium fluoride, and the usual flavouring agents and preservatives. The thickener is added in such an amount that a suitable consistency is achieved. The fluoride can be used up to the maximally permitted amount.
