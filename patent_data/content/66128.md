# Device for forming yarn packages.

## Abstract
The device for formation of packages for textile produc tion comprises a mechanism for rotating a pirn 2, a vibrating thread guide 16, fixed through a vibrator 15 to an operating carriage 6 of the mechanism for the basic reciprocating movement of the thread guide 16. The operating carriage 6 is mounted upon gliders 7 and 8, fixed to the machine body, parallel with the axis of the pirn 2. The operating carriage 6 comprises two electromagnets 9 and 10, to which respective operating elements 33 and 32, 31 and 33 are mounted, through which a driving belt 3 passes, stretched between the pulleys 4 and 5, parallel with the axis of the pirn 2. The commanding mechanism, ensuring the periodical trans lational shifting of the thread guide 16 towards the top of the pirn, comprises a controlling belt 24 and a commanding electromechanical device 13. The controlling belt 24 is stretched between rollers 26 and 27, parallel with the axis of the pirn 2. Its two ends are fixed to the operating carriage 6. Upon the controlling belt 24 at the one end of the operating carriage 6 a switching on element 22 and a switching off element 23 are fixed. The commanding electromechanical device comprises a commanding carriage 29, situated upon gliders 7 and 8, between the switching on element 22 and switching off element 23. Upon the commanding carriage 29 a switching on block 25 with a switching on element 35 and a controlling transducer 28 is mounted. The controlling trans ducer 28 comprises a sensing arm 34, mounted upon an immovable axis 14, fixed to the commanding carriage 29, and a plug 36. The two poles of the plug 36 are connected respectively to the commanding carriage 29 and the sensing arm 34. The operating carriage 6 and the controlling carriage 29 are connected with the control through an electric circuit which comprises an electromagnetic relay 19 with a normal ly closed plug 20, a normally opened plug 21 and a bobbin 12. The two ends of the bobbin 12 are connected in parallel with the bobbin 18 of the electromagnet 10. The one end of the bobbin 18 is connected through the switching on block 25 with the controlling transducer 28, and its other end is connected with the joint point of one of the ends of bobbin 17 and the negative pole of the source 37. The ends of the normally opened plug are connected in parallel with the controlling transducer 28. The one end of the normally closed plug 20 is connected in series with the bobbin 17 of the electromagnet 9, and its other end is connected in series with the joint point of the controlling transducer 28 and the positive pole of source 37.
