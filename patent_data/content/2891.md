# Process for forming ceramic bodies employing aqueous lubricant.

## Abstract
An aqueous solution of a high molecular weight, water soluble polymer is useful as a lubricant in processes for forming green ceramic bodies. The polymer which is preferably, a water soluble ethylene oxide polymer having a solid density of from 1.15 to 1.26 has an average molecular weight of from 100,000 to 5,000,000. Additionally the solution also contains a corrosion inhibitor.
