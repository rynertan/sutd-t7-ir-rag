# Heterocyclic amides.

## Abstract
The invention provides a series of novel heterocyclic amides of the formula I in which the group ACRa can be CRb CRa , CHRb CHRa or N CRa , the amidic group Re.L can be Re.X.CO.NH, Re.X.CS.NH or Re.NH.CO attached at position 4, 5 or 6 of the benzenoid moiety, Z is an acid group selected from carboxy, an acylsulphonamide residue of the formula CO.NH.SO The compounds of formula I are leukotriene antagonists. The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the formula I compounds pharmaceutical composi tions containing the formula I compounds, or their salts, for use in the treatment of, for example, allergic or inflammatory diseases, or endotoxic or traumatic shock conditions and processes for the manufacture of the formula I compounds, as well as intermediates for use in such manufacture.
