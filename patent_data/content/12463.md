# Thermosetting resinous binder compositions, their preparation, and use as coating materials.

## Abstract
Theromosetting binder composition for coating, com prising I 1 A non acidic resinous compound, saturated. molecular weight at least 900, alcoholic hydroxyl content at least 0,2 eq. 100 g 2 as cross linking agent a non acidic polyester of a polycarboxylic acid, having more than one Î² hydroxyl ester group per molecule, at least one of components 1 and 2 having an alcoholic hydroxyl functionality of more than 2, and II as curing catalyst a transesterification promoting me tal salt or complex which is soluble in liquid hydro carbons. For aqueous compositions component I 1 is pre ferably a neutralized epoxy resin amine adduct and com ponent II should be insoluble in water the can be used for cathodic electrodeposition.
