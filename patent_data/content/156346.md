# Method and apparatus for detecting inferior container.

## Abstract
In a method for detecting an inferior container, wherein light beams are projected in different two directions upon a side of a transparent or a semitransparent test container while the container is rotatably diven both of a transmitted beam which is one of the above light beams, having pene trated through the container, and a reflected beam which is the other of the above light beams, having reflected from the container are simultaneously received by a common photo receptive surface a composite image constructed of both of the transmitted beam and the reflected beam is projected upon this photo receptive surface and an inferior container is detected by means of a shadow formed in this image.
