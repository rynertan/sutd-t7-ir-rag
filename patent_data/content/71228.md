# Control system for hydraulic circuit apparatus.

## Abstract
A control system for a hydraulic circuit apparatus including at least first and second variable displacement volume type hydraulic pumps 1, 10 , at least first and second hydraulic actuators 4, 40 driven by the pumps, and valve means 6a, 6b for controlling hydraulic connections be tween the pumps 1, 10 and the actuators 4, 40 . The control system includes means 71 for deciding the order of priority of hydraulic connections between the first actuator 4 and the first and second hydraulic pumps 1, 10 and the order of priority of hydraulic connections between the second pump 10 and the first and second actuators 4, 40 , first means 76 for sensing maximization of the displacement volume of the first pump 1 , second means 77 for sensing that the displacement volume of the second pump 10 has become substantially zero, and means 74 for deciding target displacement volumes of the first and second pumps 1, 10 based on information supplied at least by the priority order deciding means 71 and first and second sensing means 76, 77 . When the flow rate of hydraulic fluid supplied to the first actuator 4 is increased, the displacement volume of the second pump 10 is increased from substantially zero after the displacement volume of the first pump 1 is maximized. When the flow rate of hydraulic fluid supplied to the first actuator 4 is reduced, the displacement volume of the first pump 1 is reduced after the displacement volume of the second pump 10 has become substantially zero.
