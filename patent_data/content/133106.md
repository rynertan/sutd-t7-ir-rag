# Preparation of silane from amine alanes.

## Abstract
A process for the coproduction of silane and AIF, is described. SiF₄ and amine alane AIH₃, NR₃ complexes are reacted to produce gaseous siiane and AIF₃ coproduct. The amine tends to complex somewhat with coproduct AIF₃ but is released therefrom by heating. AIF₃ is a very saleable com modity thereby making the invention an improvement over other hydride reactions which produce less usable cop roducts.
