# Flow rate measuring apparatus having vortex generating element and hot wire element.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the velocity of the rate of flow of a flowing fluid, comprising a vortex generating element 20 disposed in a flow tube to create a Karman vortex street in the fluid flow, a hot wire element 22, 22 disposed in the flow tube, transducer means 22, 22 , 30, 50, 62 for producing first flow rate signal based on the frequency of shedding of Karman vortices from the vortex generating element 20 and second flow rate signal 30, 40, 64 based on the cooling effect of the flowing fluid on the hot wire element 22, 22 and signal selection means 68, 70 for selectively putting out the first signal under steady flow conditions and the second signal under pulsating flow conditions. Preferably the hot wire element 22, 22 is made to serve also as the probe element for detection of the vortex generation frequency, and the first signal under steady flow conditions is utilized also to calibrate the second signal.
