# Resin composition having improved internal and external lubricating properties.

## Abstract
The present disclosure relates to a resin composition having improved internal and external lubricating properties. The resin compositions comprises polyvinyl chloride or a copolymer thereof and one or more branched chain mono carboxylic acids and or derivatives thereof. Such derivatives are selected from the group consisting of a esters of phenols or aromatic, aliphatic or cyc loaliphatic alcohols having at least 1 to 10 primary or secon dary hydroxyl groups b amides of ammonia or aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or saromatic amines having at least 1 to 15 primary or secondary amino groups c salts of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, amphoteric metals, heavy metals, of ammonium or of a compound containing a tertiary amino group. The branched chain monocarboxylic acids are telomeric acids obtained by the free radical addition of 1 mole of acetic anhydride to at least three moles of hexene and or higher olefins containing up to 30 or more carbon atoms C₃₀ in the presence of a trivalent manganese compound.
