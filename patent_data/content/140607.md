# HERMETICALLY SEALED CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A hermetically sealed connector, suitable for use in the construction of a launcher for the transfer of energy from a coaxial cable to an integrated circuit, comprising an annular body 1 defining a bore in which is disposed an annular insulator 5 which in turn supports a central electrical con tact 3 , said body defining an external thread 2 of relative ly large diameter adapted for the connection of a coaxial connector thereto with the central contact of the connector in communication with the central contact, and having an annular extension 7 defining a thread 8 of relatively small diameter an annular header 9 defining a thread by which the header is connected to the body extension and a thread of relatively large diameter 21 by which the header may be attached to a structure and a hermetic seal means 12 housed within said header in sealing engagement with said body in said header, said seal means including an elongate conductor 13 extending from said central contact through said seal means in sealing engagement therewith.
