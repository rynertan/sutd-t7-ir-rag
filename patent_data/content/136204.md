# Control of signal timing apparatus in automatic test systems using minimal memory.

## Abstract
A system is disclosed which enables signals to be supplied at precisely desired times in an automatic test system. The ap paratus includes a base delay memory which stores informa tion related to a base time delay, while a vernier memory stores information relating to timing corrections to be made to the base time delay. The base delay memory controls a counter while the correction memory controls a vernier deskew appa ratus for further delaying the output signal from the counter. To prevent carries from the vernier memory from influencing the base delay memory, the most significant bit of the vernier memory is of the same significance as the least significant bit of the base delay memory. The most significant bit of the ver nier memory is also connected to drive the counter, in effect providing the counter with two least significant bits, and en abling a single base delay memory to control more than one sig nal timing paths.
