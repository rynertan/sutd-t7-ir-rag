# VEHICLE BODY WITH ASYMMETRIC LOCATION OF FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS

## Abstract
The body 1 of a vehicle has a floor and two sides, with a body longitudinal center line L1 being defined midway be tween these two sides. A driver s seat 4 is fixed to the floor on one side of this body longitudinal center line, and a front pas senger s seat 5 is fixed to the floor on the other side thereof. The approximate center L3 of the driver s seat 4 lies sub stantially closer to this body longitudinal center line L1 than does the approximate center L4 of the front passenger s seat 5 . Thereby, more room is obtained for the driver, at the ex pense of somewhat diminishing the room available for the front passenger. Further, it becomes possible for the driver s seat 4 directly to oppose the control pedals 6, 7, 8 , without any slanting sitting attitude being required from the driver. Option ally, a hand brake lever 10 and or a transmission shift lever 9 may be fitted approximatey on the central line between the driver s seat and the front passenger seat, and further optional ly the central point between the inner ends of the sun visors 12, 13 for the driver and the front passenger may also lie ap proximately on the seat center line, at which seat center line further, optionally, the rear view mirror 11 may be positioned. Thereby, the essential asymmetry of this passenger compart ment arrangement may be effectively concealed from the be holder.
