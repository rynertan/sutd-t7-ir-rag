# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE ENAMINES OR IMINES

## Abstract
An allylamine derivative of the formula The preparation of the catalyst is described. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as an ether, ketone or halide at 80 to 120 C for 1 15 hours using 1 2,000 to 1 10,000 mole catalyst per mole of derivative I , followed by distillation off of the solvent. The products are obtained in high yield and of high optically active purity.
