## Description
The invention relates to a thermal radiation detector comprising means having a temperature dependent characteristic for detecting thermal energy, wherein the detecting means are supported by at least one flexible film which is substantially transparent in the wavelength range of the radiation to be detected in operation, and wherein with respect to the direction of incidence of thermal radiation to be detected, said one flexible film precedes the detecting means. The invention further relates to an array of such detectors. A detector as set forth in the opening sentence wherein the detecting means comprise an element of pyroelectric material is known from European Patent Application EP A 0041297. In one form of infrared detector described therein, the element of pyroelectric material is supported by and between two flexible plastics films of polyimide material around 0.85µm in thickness which transmit approximately 80 of incident radiation in the wavelength range of 8 14µm, and the detector is adapted for infrared radiation that is to be detected to be incident on one of the plastics films. The plastics films support electrically conductive layers providing electrical connections to the pyroelectric element. This arrangement enables the detector to have particularly low susceptibility to microphony as well as low lateral thermal conductance. A problem with thermal radiation detectors is to absorb sufficient of the incident radiation. For example, pyroelectric materials suitable for good quality detectors typically have rather low absorption over at least part of the wavelength range for which it is desirable to provide such detectors furthermore, the thinner the detector a feature which is desirable to reduce particularly thermal capacitance as well as its thermal conductance to the surroundings , the lower will be the overall absorption of the incident radiation by the pyroelectric material. A conventional way of improving absorption has been to apply a black blackening however, appropriate materials have the disadvantages of being awkward to apply and having poor adhesion. The paper The application of thin film absorber coatings to enhance the sensitivity of fast pyroelectric detectors by Peter C. LaDelfe According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a thermal radiation detector for detecting radiation in a selected wavelength range, comprising means having a temperature dependent characteristic for detecting thermal energy, wherein the detecting means are supported by at least one flexible film which is substantially transparent in said wavelength range, and wherein with respect to the direction of incidence of thermal radiation to be detected, said one flexible film precedes the detecting means, characterised in that the detector comprises an electrically resistive layer which has a net effective resistance per square of substantially 377 1 n² ohms per square, where n is the refractive index of said one flexible film, and is disposed immediately adjacent said one flexible film between the flexible film and the detecting means whereby to absorb incident radiation in said wavelength range, in that the detecting means are thermally coupled to the resistive layer, and in that the optical thickness of substantially transparent dielectric material preceding the detecting means and comprising said one flexible film is one quarter of a selected wavelength in said wavelength range. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a thermal radiation detector for detecting radiation in a selected wavelength range, comprising means having a temperature dependent characteristic for detecting thermal energy, wherein the detecting means are supported by at least one flexible film which is substantially transparent in said wavelength range, and wherein with respect to the direction of incidence of thermal radiation to be detected, said one flexible film precedes the detecting means, characterised in that the detector comprises an electrically resistive layer which is disposed immediately adjacent the side of said one flexible film remote from the detecting means and which has a net effective resistance per square so as to absorb incident radiation in said wavelength range, in that a reflecting, electrically conductive, layer, which reflects incident radiation in the thermal radiation range, substantially coextensive with the resistive layer is disposed between said one flexible film and the detecting means, in that the detecting means are thermally coupled to the resistive layer, and in that the optical thickness of substantially transparent dielectric material preceding the detecting means and comprising said one flexible film is one quarter of a selected wavelength in said wavelength range. Suitably, the optical thickness of said one flexible film is one quarter of said selected wavelength. This avoids difficulties such as crazing which would be liable to arise if a layer of suitable dielectric material, which typically is brittle, were to be deposited on a flexible film to make up a total optical thickness of a quarter of the selected wavelength. The invention involves the recognition that a flexible film which is used to support the detecting means and which can provide the mechanical advantage of low microphony and the thermal advantage of low thermal conductance can also be used as part or, preferably, the whole of the thickness of a quarter wavelength optical layer in combination with an electrically resistive layer for improving the absorption of incident thermal radiation. The resistive layer has a net effective resistance per square such that it absorbs a substantial proportion of incident radiation in the wavelength range. The selected wavelength is that at which it is desired that the absorption of incident radiation by the resistive layer should be substantially a maximum. If the electrically resistive layer is electrically in parallel with one or more adjacent further layers having some electrical conductivity, then either the resistance per square of the further layer s should be sufficiently high not substantially to reduce the effective resistance per square of the first mentioned electrically resistive layer, or the resistance per square of said electrically resistive layer should be selected so that in combination with the further layer s , its net effective resistance per square has a suitable value for substantially absorbing radiation in the desired operating wavelength range. A detector embodying the invention can be relatively easy to make, and the means used to improve the absorption of radiation need add only relatively little thermal capacitance to the detector. Said selected wavelength may be such as substantially to maximise the absorption of incident radiation by the detector over said wavelength range. It may be noted that UK Patent Application GB 2 100 058 A discloses a thermal radiation detector comprising an element of pyroelectric material supported by and between two flexible films of polyimide material each having a thickness of about 1µm and further comprising a layer for absorbing incident radiation that is disposed between one of the flexible films and the pyroelectric element the absorbing layer may be of antimony 50 nm thick. In that detector, however, the absorbing layer is contiguous with a coextensive electrically conductive further layer which may be of aluminium about 0.5µm thick. The latter layer has a very low resistance per square, so that the net effective resistance per square of the absorbing layer is at least as low. Consequently, the absorption of incident radiation by the absorbing layer will depend on processes not concerned with the electrical conductance of the layer. In the form of detector according to the second aspect of the invention, with respect to the direction of incidence of thermal radiation to be detected, the resistive layer may be immediately preceded by free space, and in this case the resistive layer suitably has a resistance per square substantially equal to the characteristic impedance of free space. Preferably, the total thermal capacitance of said layer or layers and of the portion of said one flexible film coextensive therewith is much less than the thermal capacitance of the detecting means. According to a further aspect of the invention, in a detector wherein the detecting means have a surface adjacent to the layer which is disposed between the detecting means and said one flexible film and that layer extends over substantially the whole of said surface of the detecting means and substantially beyond at least part of the periphery thereof, that layer may supply to the detecting means at said surface thereof thermal energy from radiation incident on every part of said resistive layer. The above mentioned UK Patent Application GB 2 100 058 A discloses a detector of thermal radiation wherein thermal energy is supplied to detecting means in this case a pyroelectric element from radiation incident on an operative surface region of the detector substantially larger than an adjacent face of the pyroelectric element. This aspect of the present invention involves the recognition that the layer disposed between the detecting means and the flexible film in an embodiment of the present invention can extend substantially beyond at least part of the periphery of the adjacent face of the detecting means and can be used to supply to the detecting means at that face thermal energy from radiation incident on an operative surface region larger than that face. Where the layer disposed between the detecting means and the flexible film is a resistive layer, the extent of that layer generally constitutes the operative surface region of the detector, and thermal energy from radiation incident on a portion of the layer not overlying the detecting means may be supplied laterally to the detecting means along the flexible film as well as along the layer itself. Where the layer disposed between the detecting means and the flexible film is an electrically conductive layer, the operative surface region of the detector is generally constituted by the extent of the resistive layer on the opposite side of the flexible film. Thermal energy from radiation incident on the resistive layer in any case has to travel through the flexible film and, in the case of radiation incident on a portion of the resistive layer not overlying the detecting means, can travel laterally towards the detecting means more readily along the electrically conductive layer than along the resistive layer. A detecting array may comprise a plurality of substantially similar, substantially uniformly spaced such detectors, wherein said one flexible film is common to all the detectors, and wherein the gap between the respective layers, disposed between the detecting means and said one flexible film, of adjacent detectors is substantially smaller than the gap between the respective detector means thereof. Suitably, in a detector embodying the invention, the detecting means comprise an element of pyroelectric material. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the diagrammatic drawings which are not to scale and in which Referring to Figure 1, a detector of thermal radiation comprises an element 1 of pyroelectric material supported by at least one flexible film 2. The detector is adapted for radiation that is to be detected to be incident in the direction of the arrow 3, the flexible film 2 which thus precedes the pyroelectric element 1 transmitting a substantial majority of incident radiation in the operating wavelength range of the detector. When the temperature of the pyroelectric element 1 changes owing to the absorption of thermal energy from incident radiation, charges are developed at opposed faces of the element, in this case the upper and lower major surfaces as drawn 4 and 5 respectively, and may be detected via electrical connections not shown made to those faces the surfaces 4 and 5 are in this embodiment provided with respective electrode layers 6 and 7. Since charges are developed at the faces 4 and 5 only while the temperature of the element 1 changes, the radiation incident on the detector must vary with time in order that it may be detected. This may inherently be the case where it is desired that the detector should respond to changes in an otherwise substantially unchanging environment as for example in an intruder detector it may alternatively be achieved by scanning the detector across a scene being viewed or by chopping the incident radiation. Since the pyroelectric element 1 especially if it is very thin as well as the flexible film 2 may generally absorb relatively little of the incident radiation over at least part of the operating wavelength range, it is desirable to increase the absorption of radiation in order to increase the sensitivity of the detector. This may be done by choosing the thickness of the flexible film 2 so as to reduce the reflection of incident radiation and by providing between the pyroelectric element 1 and the flexible film 2 an electrically resistive layer 8 with a suitable resistance per square substantially to absorb radiation. Reflection is a minimum at wavelengths for which the optical thickness of the film 2, i.e. the product of its physical thickness and its refractive index Since radiation is absorbed by the resistive layer, it is of course necessary that the pyroelectric element should be thermally well coupled to it in order for the temperature of the element to be changed by the thermal energy of the absorbed radiation. A theoretical analysis shows that the absorption where In that case, the expression for the absorption simplifies to If The above theoretical analysis strictly applies only if the resistive layer is immediately succeeded by free space. Where the resistive layer is followed by further material comprising for example a pyroelectric element, the actual value of The pyroelectric element 1 may be mounted in the manner described in the above mentioned European Patent Application EP 41 297 A, suitably using a second flexible film not shown adjacent the lower face 5 of the pyroelectric element so that the element is sandwiched between the films. The pyroelectric material may for example be PLMZT, and the element 1 may for example have major surfaces which are square with a side of 0.5 mm and may have a thickness of 20 µm, obtained by polishing down a thicker slice of the material. The flexible film s may be of polyimide material. In the case of a detector for which it is desired to maximise absorption of radiation by the resistive layer at a wavelength of 8 µm, and taking a value for The above analysis has neglected the effect on the resistance per square of the electrically resistive layer 8 of the contiguous coextensive electrode layer 6. Preferably, either the resistance per square of the electrode layer 6 should be sufficiently high not substantially to reduce the net effective resistance per square of the electrically resistive layer 8 which may be quite acceptable for high impedance detecting means such as a pyroelectric element , or the resistance per square of the layer 8 Figure 2 is a cross section of a second embodiment of the invention wherein the same reference numerals are used as in Figure 1 for corresponding integers. In this embodiment, an electrically conductive substantially reflecting layer 9 is disposed between the pyroelectric element 1 and the flexible film 2, and an electrically resistive layer 10 coextensive with the layer 9 is disposed on the other side of the film 2. As a result, incident thermal radiation which is transmitted rather than being absorbed by the resistive layer 10 can be reflected back by the layer 9 for further absorption by the layer 10 the optical thickness of the film 2 is again one quarter of the selected wavelength. Where, as in this particular embodiment, the resistive layer 10 is immediately preceded by free space, the resistance per square of the resistive layer is suitably equal to the characteristic impedance of free space, i.e. substantially 377 ohms. It is considered that for the reflecting layer 9, a resistance per square of the order of 1 ohm should be adequately low. This embodiment can be made in a similar manner to that of Figure 1 the reflecting layer 9 suitably comprises a nickel chromium seed layer coated with a gold layer both formed by vacuum deposition . In the embodiment of Figure 1, an electrical connection to the upper electrode layer 6 may be made by forming the electrically resistive layer 8 with an extension to provide such a connection. The dimensions of this extension may be selected as a compromise between minimising thermal conductance to reduce the loss of thermal energy from the detector and minimising Johnson noise due to the connection. An electrical resistance for the connection for example to an amplifier roughly of the order of 1 kilohm may be suitable. In the embodiment of Figure 2, a similar connection may be provided by a further electrically resistive layer on the flexible film 2 on the lower surface thereof as drawn overlapping an edge portion of the electrically conductive layer 9. In each embodiment, an electrical connection to the lower electrode layer 5 may for example be provided in the manner described in the above mentioned European Patent Application EP 41 297 A. Compared with the embodiment of Figure 1, the embodiment of Figure 2 has the disadvantage that the thermal energy of radiation absorbed in the resistive layer 10 has to be conducted through the flexible film 2 to reach the detecting means the pyroelectric element 1 but the advantage that it can achieve higher absorption of the incident radiation. Although a plastics material typically used for the flexible flim has low thermal conductivity, the thickness of the film is generally so small typically about 1 µm that the thermal conductance is fairly high, and overall it is considered that the advantage will usually outweigh the disadvantage. In the embodiments of Figures 1 and 2, the area, from radiation incident on which area thermal energy is supplied to the pyroelectric element 1, is substantially equal to the area of the upper major surface 4 of the pyroelectric element. It may be desirable for thermal energy to be collected from radiation incident on a larger area Figures 3 and 4 show two further embodiments corresponding respectively to those of Figures 1 and 2 in which this is the case. The resistive layer 8A in the embodiment of Figure 3 and, in the embodiment of Figure 4, the conducting layer 9A and the coextensive resistive layer 10A extend over the whole of the surface 4 of the pyroelectric element and substantially beyond the periphery thereof, in this case at least on two opposite sides of the periphery i.e. to the left and to the right as drawn . The pyroelectric element may be situated substantially centrally with respect to the layer s , but this is by no means critical it is however important that thermal energy from radiation incident on a part of the detector remote from the detecting means should be supplied to the detecting means by thermal conduction over a distance which is substantially less than the thermal diffusion distance which depends on the maximum frequency of operation of the detector , as discussed in the above mentioned UK Patent Application GB 2 100 058 A. The layer s need not be of the same shape as the adjacent surface of the pyroelectric element for example, where the latter is square as mentioned above , the layers may be rectangular or circular. The embodiments of Figures 3 and 4 may be made in a similar manner to those of Figures 1 and 2. In the embodiment of Figure 3, since the electrically resistive layer 8A extends beyond the electrode layer 6, it may be desirable for the latter layer to have a relatively high resistance per square so that the net effective resistance per square of the electrically resistive layer 8A does not vary greatly across the layer 8A. An embodiment of the invention wherein the layer disposed between the detecting means and the flexible film extends substantially beyond the periphery of an adjacent surface of the detecting means may be particularly suitable for forming an array of detectors, especially where it is desired that the gap between two adjacent detectors should be small. Figures 5 and 6 are respectively a cross section and a plan view from the underside of part of a linear array of detectors each of the form shown in Figure 3 the three detectors shown comprise respective pyroelectric elements 11, 21 and 31 and respective resistive layers 18A, 28A and 38A, and are supported on a common flexible film 2. Each two adjacent resistive layers are separated by a respective narrow gap 40. The gaps may be produced by evaporation of the resistive metal through a mask, or by photolithograpy and etching of a continuous resistive coating for the complete array. The pyroelectric elements may each be squares of 0.5 mm side, and the resistive layers may measure 0.5 mm x 0.6 mm, i.e. an average overlap of 50 µm on each of two opposite sides of the associated pyroelectric element the gap between adjacent resistive layers may be 20 µm wide. Thermal detecting means other than a pyroelectric element may be used in an embodiment of the invention, for example a dielectric element whose capacitance changes with temperature, changes in capacitance being measured. Although in the embodiments of the invention described with reference to the drawings the flexible film 2 constitutes all the substantially transparent dielectric material preceding the detecting means, such material whose total optical thickness is a quarter of the selected wavelength might comprise other dielectric material as well, the thickness of the flexible film being reduced accordingly. For example, a layer of other dielectric material could be vacuum deposited on the flexible film on the side thereof remote from that on which the thermal detecting means are disposed if this other dielectric material had a refractive index higher than that of the flexible film material, this would mean that the total physical thickness of the dielectric material would be reduced. This might be advantageous in embodiments wherein the resistive layer is on the side of the flexible film remote from the detecting means, in that the path length for the transmission of thermal energy from the resistive layer to the detecting means would be reduced the thermal conductivity of the other dielectric material must of course also be taken into account . However, the deposition of a thin layer of relatively brittle dielectric material on a flexible film is liable to result in the thin layer breaking up or crazing .
