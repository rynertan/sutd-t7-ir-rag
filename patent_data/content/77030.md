## Description
ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL WITH IMPROVED SEPARATOR SYSTEM Background of the Invention This invention relates to separators for use in electrochemical cells and, in particular, for use in electrochemical cells having a zinc electrode. As is known, the cycle life of alkaline batteries employing zinc electrodes such as, for example, nickel zinc, silver zinc and manganese dioxide zinc, is limited by a number of fareors. One primary factor is shorting of the battery electrodes which results from the growth of zinc dendrites. These dendrites produce tree like conductive branches which eventually penetrate the battery separator to provide a conductive path between positive and negative electrodes, thereby shorting same. Another factor limiting battery life is so called shape change of the zinc electrode. Shape change is the phenomenon of movement of the zinc active material from the electrode edges to the electrode center, thereby significantly reducing the elec trode surface area available for electrochemical reaction. As is also well known, the degree of dendritic growth and the degree of shape change occurring in an alkaline battery are a function of the battery separator. Conventional battery separators typically comprise multiple layers which are selected to be compatible with the cell electrolyte. These layers are also selected to be sufficiently permeable to allow for the passage of electro lyre ions, but not so highly permeable as to readily permit the passage of other materials, e.g., electrode derived conductive substances. Separators of this type ocllatly contain one or more layers of membranous material i.e., a material having a permeability of about 5 x .2 mole min x in or less . A typical membranous material might be cellophane. Other types of membranous material might be as disclosed in U.S. patents 3,351,495 3,539,396 or 3,970,472.While multilayer separators of the aforesaid type are found to significantly inhibit dendritic growth, they are not as effective in inhibiting electrode shape change which still can occur and eventually result in battery failure. A further separator construction has been disclosed in European patent application 81103917.1 publication No. 0040826 equivalent to U.S. patent application Serial No.152,725, assigned to the same assignee whereof wherein the separator comprises a blend of a polyamide e.g., Elvamides , a significantly lower pore size polymeric constituent e.g., polyethylene oxide and a zinc reactive material e.g., cerium dioxide ., In this separator, while the polymeric constituent acts to inhibit dendritic growth akin to the above described membranous materials, the polyamide constituent, provides sufficient permeability to significantly retard shape change. Additionally, shape change is further retarded by the zine reactive additive material.The resultant separator is thus said to prevent both zinc dendritic growth and electrode shape change. U.S. patent application Serial No, 204,645, also assigned to the same assignee hereof, discloses another separator construction in which a liquid polymer solution is disposed in,a container comprised of a layer of solid microporous material, and the container layer is disposed adjacent the cell electrode so as to create at least a layer of solution and a layer of solid microporous material or ward of the electrode surfaces. In this cnstruction, the solution acts to prevent dendl ic growth and microporous material acts to prevent shape change. While the separators described above have provided a degree of extended battery life, research is still con tinuing to obtain separators which can extend battery life still further. It is an object of the present invention to provide an alkaline battery separator system which promotes longer cycle life than heretofore obtainable. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an alkaline battery separator system which further retards dendritic growth and electrode shape change. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the principles of the present invention, the above and other objectives are realized in an apparatus comprising a zinc negative electrode and a separator system including a polymer coating or layer on the edges of the negative electrode and a unitary multilayer microporous film supported adjacent the electrode. In the apparatus to be described hereinbelow, the polymer is of a type which can prevent charging and dissolution of the zinc active material. The layers of the multilayer film, in turn, are each polymer based and are made unitary or integral by casting one on the top of the other or by laminating. Preferably, three or more layers are employed, with at least one of the inner layers containing a filler which catalizes the reaction of metal zinc with the electrolyte ions to form products soluble in the electrolyte. Metal oxides which catalize the reaction of metal zinc with hydroxy OH ions to form soluble products are preferable. Brief Descriution of the Drawings The above and other features and aspects of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following detail description in conjunction with the attached drawings, in which FIG. 1 shows apparatus including a separator system in accordance with the principles of the present invention and FIG. 2 illustrates a front view of the electrode of the apparatus of FIG. 1. Detailed Description In FIG. 1, the electrochemical apparatus 1 includes a zinc negative electrode 2 which cooperates with a positive electrode not shown and an electrolyte also not shown disposed between the electrodes to provide generation of electrical energy through electrochemical reaction. A separator system 3 separates the zinc negative electrode 2 from the positive electrode and is designed both to inhibit the growth of zinc dendrites and to retard electrode shape change. In accordance with the invention, the separator system 3 comprises a non porous polymer coating or layer 3a see FIG. 2 applied to the edges 2a 2d of the electrode 2 and a unitary microporous multilayer film 3b supported adjacent the edge coated electrode. In FIG. 1, the film 3b isillustrativaly shown as abag surrounding the electrode2, However, the film might also be beat sealed to the electrode edges, as well as formed into other config uragtions. In general, the film 3b sold comprise a polymer material which is chemically and mechanically stable in the electrochemical cell environment. Furthermore, the film should be capable of providing a desired degree of ionic flow, while also being capable of exhibiting uniformity with the presence therein of large amounts of filler. Preferably, the film 3b comprises several layers, these layers being capable of being processed by any one of a num ber of known techniques such as, for example, casting or larinating, to form a unitary multilayer film. More prefer ably, the film 3b contains at least three microporous layers, an inner one of which includes a filler capable of catalizing the reaction of metal zinc with the electrolyte ions to form products soluble in the electrolyte. The layers of the film 3b should also exhibit uniformity in pore distribution and may contain other additives. Suitable organic microporous polymers for the film layers are nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride, while suitable inorganic acditives are CeO2, ZnO, Alumina, potassium titanate, etc. Useable catalizing fillers are metal oxide or compound fillers such as, for example, nickel oxide, iron oxide, chromium oxide, etc., iron boride, iron carbide, nickel boride, nickel carbide, cobalt boride, and cobalt carbide. The polymer material used for the coating 3a should be chemically and mechanically stable in the cell environ ment. Furthermore, the material should be capable of preventing the active material typically, zinc oxide at the edges of the electrode 2 from charging and dissolving. Preferably, the coating should be formed from a solution ot tee polymer and should exhibit good adhesion to the zinc active material. Suitable organic polymers are nylon, Folyelfone, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, etc. Also, the coat ing should be sufficiently thick as to provide resistance to the swelling of the adjacent positive electrode, a thickness of the range of 5 30 mils being useable. The coating 3a and the film 3b significantly retard electrode shape change and zinc dendrictic growth, respective ly. More specifically, the coating 3a tends to counteract several effects which promote shape change of the electrode 2. A first effect is the preferable dissolution of the electrode edges in comparison with the center, this effect being due to the edges coming in contact with larger amounts of the elec trolyte and to their being at a higher current density. The coating 3a insulates the edges from the increased amounts of electrolyte and results in a more uniform current distribu tion. This is so because the coating increases the electrical resistance and, therefore, lowers the current density at the edges. The edge resistance and current density are thus caused to approach the uniform resistance and current distri bution of the uncoated electrode region. A second effect is swelling of the positive electrode which results in pressing of the electrode 2 and squeezing out of the electrolyte. This effect is present to ia greater degree at the center of the electrode 2 and stimu lates its shape change. The polymer coating 3a at the edges of the electrode 2 enables the electrode to resist the pres sure from the positive electrode and prevents tight contact between the electrodes at the electrode 2 center. Moreover, tiir coating prevents squeezing out of the electrolyLe because the coating and the electrodes form a closed permanent elec tt c .lyte reservoir. As above mentioned, the film 3b acts to retard zinc dendritric growth and thereby prevents shorting of the electrode 2 and the positive electrode. Moreover, the film 3b creates a tortuous pore network which results in a reduc tion in the permeability of zincate ions. At the same time, permeability of the film to hydroxyl ions increases slightly. Furthermore, gases formed during charging are not trapped between the layers of the film. As a result, zinc dendritic growth and non uniformity of ionic flow normally resulting from such bubbles are eliminated.

As can be seen from Table I, cells employing separators in accordance with the invention items 2 through 4 exhibited a cycle life of 1.5 to 2 times that exhibited by cells with commercial separators under the same charge and discharge test conditions.The following examples describe the details of and the procedures for making the separators of items 2 4, respectively of Table I. Example 1 In this example, the unitary film of the separator comprised three layers each formed from a microporous nylon material. The electrode coating of the separator, in turn, was prepared from solution of nylon in methanol. The nylon used for the coating was a polyamide sold under the name Elvamide 8064 manufactured by E.I. DuPont and the concen oration of the polymer was 10 by weight of the solution. The thickness of the coating was 6 mil and the width of the edges coated was l 2 from all sides. The three layer film was prepared using con stituents as in the EMO Publication 0040826, i.e., from a blend of a polyamide polymer sold under the name Elvamide 8064 manufactured by E.I. DuPont , a polyolefin oxide sold under the trade name Polyox WSR N 750 manufactured by Union Carbide and having molecular weight 300,000, cerium dioxide and a wetting agent sold under the trade name Victawet. The blend contained the following amounts of these constituents 60 by weight Elvamide 8064 20 by weight Polyox WSR N 750 12 by weight Victawet 8 by weight cerium dioxideThis blend was used for all three layers of the film, but the internal layer was further provided with nickel oxide powder in the amount of 502 by weight of theElvamide 8064.Methanol was employed as the solvent for theElvamide and Polyox, each begin dissolved in methanol separately. The required quantity of cerium dioxide andVictawet were blended with methanol and subjected to ultrasonic blending. All parts were then mixed together and the resultant mixture or solution was cast on a metal sheet using a doctor blade. The cast film or sheet was then oven dried at 600C to form a layer of solid film. A part of the solution used to make the first layer was then mixed with nickel oxide powder and the prepared blend was cast on the top of the first one and again was dried to form a two layer film. A third layer using the original solution was then cast on the second layer. The three layer film was then removed from the plate. The three layer film was heat sealed to the coated electrode edges to form the separator system. An absorber was inserted in the space between the electrode and the film to provide proper supply of electrolyte to the electrode.Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was employed with polyethylene oxide as the electrode edge coating. The coating thickness was 6 mils and the coating width 1 2 inch.The three layer film was heat sealed to form a bag and the coated electrode was placed in the bag to complete the separator system. Example 3 The procedure of Example I was employed with polyvinyl alcohol being used as the coating for the electrode edges. The thickness of the coating was 10 mils and the coating width about 1 4 inches. Tne three layer film was heat sealed to form a separator bag and the edge coated electrode was placed in the bag to form the separator system. In all cases, it is understood that the abovedescribed arrangements are merely illustrative of the many possible specific embodiments which represent applications of the present invention. Numerous and varied other arrangements can readily be devised in accordance with the principles of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
