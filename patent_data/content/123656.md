## Description
11STRANDING MACHINE PROVIDED WITH DYNAMICALLY COMPENSATEDWIRE SUPPORTING BOW1 This invention relates to a wire stranding machine to produce braided cables, metal wire ropes and other similar means, in which a plurality of metal wires are grouped together and twisted by means of a rotating structure comprising a supporting bow for the wires which rotates at high speed, while the plait or cable thus formed is drawn and wound up on a collecting spool. Machines of the above type are provided with a rotating structure consisting of a frame and two pairs of terminal collects or plates between which are secured the ends of a flexible metal element commonly called bow, provided with suitable eyelets. Because of the high rotational speed of the rotating structure, the supporting bow for the wire must necessarily be counter balanced by a corresponding bow on the opposite part, so as to render the structure symmetrical. This necessitates the application of an additional peripheral mass which however gives rise to a dissipation of power which is not negligible, due to the high rotating speed of the structure. The object of this invention is to provide a stranding machine of the type above, described but having an improved rotating structure and provided with a single wire support ing bow, suitably balanced by masses fitted on the support ing plates or clamps themselves. In this manner, a perfect ly balanced machine is obtained, which affords substantial ly reduced power consumption and permits, moreover better accessibility for the intervention of the operator when the machine is not running, thanks to the elimination of the ancillary bow. The invention will now be described in conjunction with the annexed drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is an overall schematic view of the stranding machine, FIGURES 2 thru 9 show the balancing of the single bow by means of masses fitted on the clamps. With reference to Fig. 1, the machine consists of a base plate 1, of a main drive motor 4 which feeds power, in the known manner not shown , to the different parts, two opposite supports 2 between which rotates the structure consisting of two pairs of plates or clamps 5, a frame 8 and a flexible metal element or bow 6 support ing the group of wires 7 and imparting to them the necessary torsion, thanks to the advancement of the wires which are drawn from a flywheel and wound up on a collecting spool 9. The adoption of a single bow 6 obviously determines on assymetry in the stresses which this transmits to the clamps and which may be represented schematically as a force F Fig. 2 tangential to the configuration assumed by bow 6 in the operating phase. Said stress can be broken down in its two components Fa axial and Fr radial , as shown in Fig. 2. Component Fr is compensated, according to the invention, by applying a mass 10 on plate 5 in a position opposite to bow 6 with respect to rotating axis 14 Fig. 3 . The application of a sole mass 10 on each one of clamps 5 would not compensate the axial reaction Fa which exerts the greater stress on the supporting bearings of the structure.Should this component be limited, its compensation may be unnecessary, if the bearings are apt to withstand the resulting torque. As an alternative the bearings may be replaced with heavier duty ones. However, also this stress component is compensated, preferably, by applying two additional equal masses 12 fitted laterally with respect to axis 14, as shown in Fig. 3. The two masses are equal, so as to compensate each other, due to the effect of centrifugal force and are set laterally with respect to the vertical axis of symmetry of the plate, in order to compensate axial movement Na of the structure, acting on the bearings. In Fig. 4, the masses applied below axis of rotation 14 are incorporated in a single mass 16, equal to the sum of masses 10 and 12 of Fig. 3, thereby providing the same compensating results, whilst affording on even greater structural simplicity. Lastly, in Fig. 5 a single mass equal to the sum of masses 10 and 12 is contemplated, which compensates the assymetry due to the presence of a single bow, thanks to plates 5 which are not symmetrical with the axis of rotation as in previous cases. More specifically, the portion of plate 5 above axis of rotation 14 is greater than the lower portion and in this case, a single suitably arranged mass is sufficient. Figs. 6 and 7 are, respectively, side and front views of the compensated plates according to the scheme ofFig. 4. Masses 12 and 16 consist respectively of suitably perforated counter weights to permit introduction between plates 5 secured by bolts 20 or similar means, and the weight of which is necessarily considered for sizing. Figs. 8 and 9 are respectively a side view and a front view according to the scheme of Fig. 5 and comprise a single offset compensating mass 18. in the manner above described, complete balancing of the system is achieved, resulting in savings on power consumptions easier accessibility as well as the possibility to increase further the machine s rotating speed as compared to that of conventional type machines which are not provided with the improvement proposed in this invention. It is evident that the masses shown in the drawings represent particular and non limitative arrangements for compensation and that the improvements extend also to all equivalent features utilizing the same principle of compensating the assymetry dynamically, due to the elimination of one bow by the provision of at least one additional mass mounted on each collet or between the pair of plates forming the clamp.
