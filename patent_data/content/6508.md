# Weather strip and balance assemblies for windows.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a weather strip and balance assembly for a window of a tilt sash type. The assembly includes a mounting plate 70 for mounting the balance assembly thereon with a weather strip 50 being clipped thereto and supporting the sash in a sliding and sealing manner. The weather strip 50 has a pair of curved supporting ridges 52, 53 which mount the sash at conventional grooved surfaces along the stiles of the same and a recessed divider portion 54 between the curved ridges in the weather strip provides for mounting and movement of the coupling pins 95 to 97 which connect the balance assembles to the sash and permit tilt of the sash on the weather strip 50 . The mounting members on the sash for coupling the pins thereto provide mating keyed surfaces 101 such that the pins rotate with the sash. These mounting members also include guide surfaces which couple the sash in a closed position.
