# Buffer system with detection of read or write circuits failures.

## Abstract
An improved data buffer has a storage tray 14 that is addressable for read and write operations by an address of n bits that are supplied by a read address counter 16 and a write address counter 18 which each have n 1 bits. The n 1 th bit is in effect a modulo 2 counter for passes through the array by the read and write circuits. During a write operation the n 1 th bit 44 of the write counter 18 is stored as part of a parity bit P for the addressed array location. During a read operation the n 1 th bit 51 of the read address counter 16 is entered into a parity checking function 30 on the word read 25 from the addressed location. An error is signalled if the n 1 th bit of the read address counter does not agree with the n 1 th bit of the write counter at the time of the write operation. For example, an error is detected if the write circuits fail and the read circuits make a second pass through words that have not previously been read. This prevents reading the same entries on a next pass through the array 14 .
