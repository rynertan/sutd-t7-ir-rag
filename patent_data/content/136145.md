## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING ALKYL CYANOFORMATES This invention relates to a process for preparing a C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformates. U.S. Patent No. 3,962,272 discloses several processes which may be used to prepare alkyl cyanoformates. It was desired, however, to provide a process that can economically produce large quantities of C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate derivatives in very high yields and provide the product consistently with high purity without the need for additional expensive purification steps. The process of this invention comprises reacting about 1.0 equivalent of a C3 C8 alkyl haloformate in a suitable solvent with about 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of an alkali metal cyanide in the presence of water and a catalytically sufficient amount of a quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst at a temperature in the range of from about 0 C. to 300C. The use of water in the present process allows for the efficiency of a liquid liquid phase transfer catalysis. The process employs readily available and inexpensive starting materials, such as C3 C8 haloformate derivatives. Several other advantages of the present process are outlined below. The term C3 C8 alkyl represents a straight or branched alkyl chain having from three to eight carbon atoms. Typical C3 C8 alkyl groups include n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec. butyl, t butyl, n pentyl, isopentyl, sec. pntyl, neopentyl, n hexyl, sec. hexyl, isohexyl, n heptyl, isoheptyl, sec. heptyl, n octyl, sec.octyl, isooctyl, 2 ethylhexyl and the like. The terms halo or halogen, as defined herein, represent fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Bromo, and especially chloro, are preferred. While the entire scope of process variables taught herein are believed advantageous, the present process does have preferred aspects. Preferably theC3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate is isobutyl cyanoformate and the preferred C3 C8 alkyl haloformate is isobutyl chloroformate. Other preferred process conditions will be noted hereinafter. The C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate prepared by the present process is reacted with an alkyl azidoacetate to provide a 5 alkoxycarbonyl IH tetrazole l acetic acid ester. The 5 alkoxycarbonyl IH tetrazole l acetic acid esters thus prepared have a variety of uses, but are preferably used as intermediates to the corresponding compound IH tetrazole l acetic acid, which is used as an intermediate in the production of certain cephalosporin compounds as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,516,997. The process of the present invention is generally performed as follows. Approximately 1.0 equivalent of a C3 C8 alkyl haloformate is added to a stirred solution of a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, such as chloroform and especially methylene chloride, and a catalytically sufficient amount of a quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst cooled to about OOC. to about 700C. with external cooling. The term catalytically sufficient amount , as defined herein, refers to an amount of a quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalyst which is capable of increasing the rate of the chemical reaction. This amount is typically relatively small in comparison to the quantity of reactants, for example, at a concentration in the range of from about 0.01 to about 5 of catalyst per equivalent of C3 C8 alkyl haloformate.The preferred quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalysts are Aliquat 336 tricaprylylmethylammonium chloride from Henkel Corp., Tucson, Arizona , and Adogen 464 methyltrialky ammonium chloride from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin and their use is described in U. S. Patent No.3,992,432. A review of quaternary ammonium phase transfer catalysts in general may be found inAldrichimica Acta, 9, 35 1976 . After the solution has cooled to a temperature in the range of about OOC. to 300C., more preferably to about 50C. to 250C., water, preferably in the form of ice, is added to the reaction mixture. The water phase permits the use of a more efficient liquid liquid phase transfer, but its use makes the reaction exothermic.Therefore, as an internal heat sink to control the exotherm, a suitable means of internal cooling such as crushed ice is preferably added to the stirring solution to generally provide a thick slurry of reactants.Another suitable means of internal cooling is a coil which is simply immersed in the reaction mixture. As the heat of reaction melts the ice, the water phase is created. While maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at about OOC. to 300C., approximately from 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of an alkali metal cyanide is generally added to the reaction mixture. Typical alkali metal cyanide reagents are potassium, lithium and especially sodium cyanide. The C3 C8 alkyl haloformate is preferably added to the reaction mixture before the addition of the alkali metal cyanide, but may also be added after the addition of the cyanide reagent. In this instance the ice slurry is formed by externally cooling with dry ice acetone, for example, an emulsion of the aqueous reaction mixture containing the alkali metal cyanide in water and the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent. When the alkali metal cyanide is added last to the reaction mixture, within one to two minutes the reaction temperature drops. When theC3 C8 alkyl haloformate is added last, the reaction commences upon the melting of the solid aqueous phase at around 250C. to 30 C. Approximately 10 to 20 minutes thereafter the temperature has risen to about 200C. to 20C. due to the heat of the reaction. However, the external cooling bath surrounding the reaction vessel should remain at a temperature less than approximately 80C. to 100C. throughout the process of the present invention.After the reaction mixture has stirred for approximately 30 to 35 minutes, the temperature of the reaction mixture drops again under the influence of the external cooling bath. At this point, the reaction is complete and the product in the organic phase is separated. Since the product is prone to hydrolytic decomposition, it is necessary for the operator to work quickly and keep the solutions cold. The lower organic layer containing the C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate, phase transfer catalyst and solvent is removed and kept cold.The upper aqueous layer is quickly extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent and the extracts combined with the product layer. The upper layer is then generally discarded. The product layer is preferably purified by adding an anhydrous drying agent, such as silica, to the solution so as to absorb the catalyst and any residual water. For example, the solution may be stirred with silica at a reduced temperature such as OOC for approximately 30 to 45 minutes. The silica is subsequently removed by filtration and may be either discarded or saved and regenerated by washing it with methanol and drying. Due to its mild conditions, another advantage of the present process is that the cyanoformate may also be formed in the presence of the alkyl azidoacetate, which acts as a cosolvent for the reaction, and the present process is preferably so conducted. At lower temperatures the alkyl azidoacetate and the alkyl cyanoformate do not react. The two reactants may be subsequently heated as described below to provide the 5 alkoxycarbonyl IH tetrazole l acetic acid ester.When the alkyl azidoacetate is present in the reaction mixture, a proportionally lesser amount of solvent and catalyst are required than when the azidoacetate is absent. However, when the solution containing the C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate contains only solvent and none of the alkyl azidoacetate, the cyanoformate may be isolated and the solvent may be recovered by fractional distillation as the product is much higher boiling than the solvent employed in the reaction. As noted above, the C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate prepared by the process of the present invention is preferably used as an intermediate to the production ofIH tetrazole l acetic acid. This synthesis has been carried out by Katner in U.S. Patent No. 3,962,272.However, several advantages exist in using a C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate in the synthesis of IH tetrazole l acetic acid. The use of a C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate in the production of the acetic acid has an added safety factor in that it has a lower vapor pressure than the corresponding methyl or ethyl cyanoformate analogs thereby reducing the occurrence of toxic fumes. The higher boiling point is also advantageous for achieving the desired reaction temperature in the preparation of the 5 alkoxycarbonyl IH tetrazole l acetic acid ester.Another advantage of using a C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate over lower alkyl cyanoformates is its lower water solubility and therefore reduced likelihood of loss to the aqueous layer in the work up of the reaction mixture of the present process. The C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate thus formed by the present process is preferably used in the preparation of the 5 alkoxycarbonyl IH tetrazole l acetic acid ester. This reaction is preferably carried out by combining one equivalent of the alkyl azidoacetate with from one to three equivalents of C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate.A halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, such as methylene chloride, may also be present in the reaction mixture but is not necessary. The reaction is substantially complete after about 14 to 24 hours when carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 1250 to 140at. After the product has formed, any excess C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate used in the reaction may be recovered by distilling off the reactant under vacuum. Therefore, since the excess C3 C8 alkyl cyanoformate may be recovered following formation df the product, the quantity of the reactant in excess of one equivalent is not critical.Having distilled off all of the reactants, substantially pure product remains which may then be directly hydrolyzed to the acetic acid. The compound thus prepared is next hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to IH tetrazole l acetic acid by procedures well known to those skilled in the art. This procedure is carried out by combining the 5 alkoxycarbonyl lH tetrazole l acetic acid ester with 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of a suitable aqueous mineral acid. Suitable acids include hydrofluoric, hydrobromic and especially hydrochloric acid. Preferably, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring and the alcohols that are liberated by the ester hydrolysis are advantageously distilled out. As the alcohols are distilled away, water should be added to the reaction mixture to maintain the original volume. Completion of this reaction is signalled by the cessation of carbon dioxide evolution, which typically takes from 4 to 6 hours. The IH tetrazole l acetic acid thus formed may be purified by any one of several well known procedures, but is preferably purified as follows. Generally, the reaction mixture is cooled to about 900C and a small quantity of nitric acid is added to the mixture. The mixture is stirred at 800C and a small quantity of decolorizing charcoal is added to the solution. The mixture is filtered hot through a Celite cake. The filtrate is slowly doled and seeded with a crystal of the product. The product thus formed is collected by filtration. The acidic mother liquor may be added to a subsequent hydrolysis reaction for recovery of additional material. Eventually, the mother liquor is discarded because of an excess of accumulated salts. The process of the present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. The compounds prepared below were characterized as peaks on the gas chromatograph and compared to a reference standard. The instrument used was a Hewlet Packard 5700, with a thermal conductivity detector. The column was 5 ft. long by 4mm ID glass, packed with 60 80 meshChrom G, coated with 4 wt XE60. The carrier gas was helium, and the rate 60 ml. min. For assaying the starting azidoacetate and cyanoformate esters the column was typically run at either 50 C. or 1000C. For assaying the tetrazole ester derivatives a column temperature of 2000C. was required.All compounds can be assayed in the same run by programming the temperature to start at 500C. held for 2 minutes and then to rise to 2300C. at 320 min. Example 1 Preparation of 2 ethylhexyl cyanoformate A solution of 600 ml. of methylene chloride and 4 grams 0.01 moles of Aliquat 336 was charged into a 2 1. 3 neck round bottom flask and cooled to approximately 600C. with a dory ice acetone bath. An aqueous solution of 120 grams 2.45 moles of sodium cyanide in 250 ml. of water was added dropwise to the reaction mixture to provide a slurry of reactants. Next, 385.38 grams 2.0 moles of 2 ethylhexyl chloroformate was added to the mixture while maintaining the temperature below approximately 400C. The external cooling was then removed from the reaction flask and the mixture was allowed to warm slowly. After 19 minutes the mixture had warmed to 250C. and the external cooling was replaced. After 9 more minutes the temperature of the reaction mixture was 170C. at which point 100 ml. of water, 200 ml. of carbon tetrachloride and 100 ml. of ice was added and the layers were allowed to separate.The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with methylene chloride. The organic extracts were combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was distilled under vacuum to provide 347.85 grams of 99.7 pure 2 ethylhexyl cyanoformate 94.9 yield . bp 950C. 12 15 mm .

The mixture was allowed to cool, whereupon an additional 30 ml. of water was added to dissolve the precipitated sodium chloride. The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was washed twice with 10 ml. aliquots of methylene chloride.The aqueous phase was discarded and the organic phases were combined and used as a solvent for the following reaction. B. Preparation of isobutyl cyanoformate The solution prepared in part A containing ethyl azidoacetate Aliquat 336 methylene chloride totaling approximately 120 ml. in volume was cooled to approximately 50C. in a 500 ml. round bottom 3 neck flask. When the solution reached 5 C, 69 grams 0.50 moles of 99 pure isobutyl chloroformate Aldrich was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was. again allowed to cool to 50C. whereupon 150 grams of crushed ice was next added to the well stirred reaction mixture.While maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at 50C, 26.91 grams 0.55 moles of sodium cyanide was added. After 30 minutes the phases were separated and the upper aqueous layer was washed twice with 5 ml. portions of methylene chloride and discarded.The methylene chloride extracts and separated organic phase were combined and stirred with silica gel at OOC for approximately 30 minutes. The mixture was filtered and the residue washed three times with 10 ml. aliquots of methylene chloride.

Preparation of 5 isobutoxycarbonyl IHtetrazole l acetic acid, ethyl ester As methylene chloride was recovered and room became available in the round bottom flask, an excess of isobutyl cyanoformate 62.42 grams, 0.46 moles prepared in a separate reaction similar to the process described in Example 1 was added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was then heated to 1300C for approximately 19 hours. The solution was next distilled in vacuo to recover 60.59 grams of excess isobutyl cyanoformate 91.1 pure cyanoformate by gas chromatography . The residual liquid product was allowed to cool to approximately 1000C while maintaining the vacuum and was used directly in the following reaction. D.

The reaction mixture was heated to reflux, and the alcohols liberated as by products of the reaction were allowed to distill out and carbon dioxide was permitted to evolve. Water was added as required during the reaction to maintain the volume in the flask at approximately 110 ml. When the distillation of the alcohols had ended, the mixture was treated with approximately 1 ml. of nitric acid to decolorize the solution.The solution was then cooled to approximately 700C and treated with charcoal. The solution was stirred for approximately 20 minutes and filtered hot into a clean 250 ml. 3 neck round bottom flask, washing with a minimum of water. The volume of the solution was reduced to approximately 120 ml. by distillation in vacuo and the mixture cooled.

The mother liquor was discarded after 9 cycles due to the salt accumulation.
