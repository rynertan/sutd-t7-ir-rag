# Blends of organic peroxides.

## Abstract
Blends of peroxides that have melting points of 5 C or lower containing 1 40 to 60 of t butyl cumyl peroxide, 2 5 to 25 of bis alpha t butylperoxyisopropyl benzene, and 3 dicumyl peroxide to 100 may easily be dispersed homogeneously as cross linkers in polymers e,g. polyethylene, EPDM, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers , even for application where ambient working temperature is below normal room temperature.
