# Low flow constant rate pump.

## Abstract
A low flow, constant rate pump is provided which comprises a fixed volume container 10 , the inner walls 12 of said container defining a receptacle for a liquid to be dispensed, said container 10 being provided with means 16 to form an unobstructed opening 18 through which said liquidly may be caused to flow continuously at a low flow, constant rate, a propellant chamber 19 within said container 10 formed of a material which is permeable to vapor from a propellant 20 of the liquid vapor type, a supply of prop ellant 20 of the liquid vapor type confined within said chamber, said propellant initially being under pressure sufficient to maintain a major portion thereof in liquid form at normal temperatures.
