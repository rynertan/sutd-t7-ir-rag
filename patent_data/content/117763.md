# Train with forerunner.

## Abstract
The frequency of accidents to trains is reduced by providing a self propelled forerunner which, under control from the train can run on the track ahead of the train. The forerunner is provided with a sensor system for surveying the track over which it is running and with means for transmitting to the train information on the track conditions so sensed. The information may be displayed to the driver of the train and or fed into an automatic controller for the train. In one embodiment of the invention, signals generated by the sensor system of the forerunner are compared with signals corresponding to the normal condition of the track as stored in a computer.

## Description
TRAIN WITH FORERUNNER As normal train speeds increase, the risk of accidents increases since there is less time left for the train driver to meet an emergency. In order to provide advance warning of conditions ahead of a moving train which might lead to an emergency there is required means for detecting conditions ahead of the train and transmitting information thereon to the train. In this way the frequency of accidents to the train may be reduced. According to the present invention, a train for moving on a rail, rails, channel or other track is characterised in that, in order to reduce the risk of accidents by providing advance warning of conditions ahead of the train when moving, it is provided with a self propelled forerunner which can run on the track at a predetermined distance ahead of the train, the control room of the train being provided with means for controlling the forerunner by signals transmitted from the train to the forerunner, and the forerunner being provided with a sensor system for surveying the track over which it is running and for transmitting to the control room signals giving information on the track conditions so sensed. Communication between the control room of the train and the forerunner, which is usually un manned, may be maintained by conventional signalling means so that i the forerunner may be controlled by the train driver or by automatic means on the train and ii information on the conditions detected by the forerunner may be transmitted back to the train for any necessary action thereon by the train driver or by automatic control. The invention is now described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1 and 2 are functional graphic views of the invention. Figure 3A to 3E illustrate an example of a transmitter and receiver in the remote control system. Fig. 4 is graphic diagram of a train control system.

Fig. 8 is a circuit of an abnormal sound detecting apparatus. Fig. 9 is 8 graphic view of a horizon and collision detecting apparatus. Fig. 10 illustrates a camera installed on the forerunner for taking pictures of the rail road condition. Fig. ii is a graphic view of a vibration detecting apparatus assembled on the forerunner. Fig. 12 is an action graphic view of an imitative vibration apparatus on the train. In Fig. 1 a train 1 is provided with a forerunning locomotive or car 2 in front of it and is able to control or guide the forerunner by means of a remote control system. The forerunner locomotive or car is provided with a sensor system for detection and survey of the road condition before it, a drive system that can be operated manually or by means of remote control, and a signal transmitter and receiver system When the train 1 is operated on the railway the forerunner is positioned ahead as shown in Fig. 1. The forerunner is capable of decelerating or accelerating, according to signals 3 transmitted from the train, by the remote control system.It also can explore and survey the road condition by use of the sensor systems in it. As a result of its survey signals 4 are transmitted back to the control room of the train as indicated in Fig. 2 by normal means such as electro magnetic waves, light or sound or tele communi cation signals passed through the rails or other equivalent methods. The train driver thus receives information to meet urgencies in good time, as shown in Fig. 2. The train can be of any type such as a diesel engine, steam, electrical, air pressurized, electro magnetic floating type or linear motor locomotive running on rails or may be a channel guided train or a suspension elevated dynamic train. A remote control system of transmitter and receiver is installed. As illustrated in Figs. 3 A to 3 E which show suitable combinations of transmitter 5 and receiver 6 for various types of systems, i.e. infra red Fig. 3A , sound waves Fig. 33 , radio Fig. 3C , ultrasonics Fig. 3D and conduction of electricity through the steel rail Fig. 3E 1 the speed of the .forerunner can be reduced, increased or pre set from the train by control of its driving system through transmission of signals to a receiver on the forerunner.At the same time the receiver on the train is used to receive the signals transmitted from the forerunner consequent on survey and exploration of the road condition at or ahead of the forerunner. These signals may be converted into images on the screen of a monitor TV located in the control room of the train, the train driver then watching the information shown on the screen for reference, or the signal data may be fed into an electronic automatic controller for constant supervision. The train can then brake urgently or control the forerunner to meet emergency conditions.A diagram of this aspect of the invention is shown inFig. 4. The forerunner is self propelled and is a self contained locomotive or car that can travel ahead of the train at preset distance. There is a transmitter aboard the forerunner and also a receiver for receiving signals through for example, radio ultra sonic waves, infra red rays, sound waves or conduction of electrical signals through the steel rail whereby the speed of the forerunner may be remotely controlled. On the forerunner, there is also a road condition detection system which may include an audio sensing instrument, a vibration detection system, and instruments for detecting unusual vapour, gas or abnormal moisture, abnormal temperatures and horizon and collisions. These transmit warning signals to the train behind the forerunner so that emergency measures can be taken.Also, it is possible to install a camera on the forerunner to take pictures of the road condition ahead which can be transmitted back to the train and shown on a monitor TV screen to provide information for the driver. The forerunner or train may also carry a computer to monitor the road condition. Stored in the computer may be information on the condition of each section of railroad, for example, on the vibration degree when the train passes over a bridge and on normal accoustic responses, for comparison with actual road condition. The train driver would be warned of any abnormal variations from the stored references to enable him to deal with unusual road condition. The programmes of each relevant section of road can be brought into use by sensors along the railway which pass on programmed information to the computer. The sensors may be installed on each section of the railway either at the roadside or above it and signals can be sent to the computer by means of electro optics, electro magnets or the customarily used preset electronics signals when the train passes. A suitable scheme is illustrated in the block diagram Fig. 5. In the above mentioned monitoring method the railroad is separated into sections and in each section is placed a detecting apparatus. For example, at the dividing point between sections, there may be detecting apparatus with an optical, electro magnetic, electro audio, or electromechanic type switch as shown in Fig. 6 in order to provide a passing signal to a programme counter or a code signal to a decoder. The output signal of the above mentioned programme counter or decoder is sent into a memory system to take stored data which relates for example to the audio reaction, horizontal slant degree Åand vibration rate of said section of rail. This is compared with the detecting signal of each detecting apparatus and if the comparison result is unusual, a signal is sent to CCU, as in the action diagram shown in Fig. 7. The detecting apparatus provided on the forerunner may be as follows a abnormal audio detecting apparatus this apparatus may be mounted on the chassis or axle with sound, electric micro audiometer and level identical circuit systems, and can produce a warning signal to CCU for reference when the incoming noise is above the normal level. Fig. 8 shows an embodiment of such a detecting apparatus. b Abnormal temperature detecting apparatus this apparatus may use a conventional thermo electric detecting system to send a detecting signal to a comparator which, when temperature is too high or too low, will transmit a warning signal to CCU. c Unusual gas detecting devices An unusual gas detecting device may be mounted on the front offÏrerunner for detecting e.g. carbon monoxide or gas. If when the forerunner is passing through a tunnel or mineral caves, there is unusual gas, the detecting apparatus will transmit a warning signal to CCU. d Abnormal moisture detecting apparatus in this apparatus an electrode may be mounted under the chasis of the forerunner at a selected distance from the surface of the railway. When there is water on the railroad or in a tunnel and the water level is high enough to be dangerous the detecting electrode will contact the water and will transmit a warning signal to CCU. e Horizon and collision detecting apparatus This apparatus may be a mercury type horizon and collision detecting apparatus as shown in Fig. 9. In this apparatus a container fizz part filled with mercury 8, is provided with two electrodes q insulated at the mounting end. The two electrodes are normally connected to each other through the mercury. If the detecting apparatus is tilted or if the moving forerunner suddenly decelerates, the mercury in the container will be displaced and the electrical contact between the two electrodes will be broken. If the detecting apparatus is turned upside down i.e. if the forerunner turns upside down , the insulator 10 of two electrodes, which is higher than the level of mercury, will also break the electrical contact between the two electrodes, and so the switch again will be open circuit. The characteristic of this detecting apparatus of the forerunner is that it can produce a signal and send it to CCU when the railroad is slanted abnormally or the locomotive is upside down or in collision with another object. The forerunner may be remotely controlled from the train or manually operated by the train driver or both for reliability. Additionally, automatically locking coupling may be provided on the forerunner and train so that if the forerunner goes out of order or emergencies arise, the forerunner and the train as well may be hauled away by another locomotive. Fig. 10 shows an arrangenent for installing a camera aboard the forerunner for surveying the road condition, and also indicates a TV receiver used as a monitor. This arrangement makes it possible for the train driver to see on the TV screen the road condition some distance ahead and thus be able to take appropriate measures to meet any emergency. In the train system of this invention it is also possible to provide imitative road condition detecting apparatus. For this purpose a vibration detecting apparatus and transmitter are provided on the forerunner as shown in Fig 11 and a receiver and driving circuit and imitative vibration apparatus are provided on the train. For example the imitative vibration apparatus may comprise a chair for driver, as shown in Fig. 12 In the vibration detecting apparatus shown in Fig. Ila mass It is supported on a base 37 by springs t3 and between the mass and the base are a number of sensors 14 for detecting relative motion between the mass and the base. By this means vibration of the base which is part of the forerunner is detected by the sensors which transmit appropriate signals. The signals are passed through an analogical or digital converting detector in order to transmit the vibration signal to CCU, which CCU transmits this signal to the vibration imitative apparatus provided on the train. The vibration imitative apparatus shown inFig. 12 comprises a seat mounted on cylinders driven by a set of electro magnetic, liquid pressure or pneumatic pressure linear driving devices. The linear driving devices are actuated by a driving control device which receives the vibration signal incoming from the forerunner. Additionally, when incoming vibration signal from the forerunner is strong, it may be applied to trigger a warning device to produce a warning signal.
