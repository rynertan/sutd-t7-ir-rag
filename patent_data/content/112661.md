# Fermentation process for the production of polysaccharides.

## Abstract
Polysaccharides, such as xanthan gum, are produced by culturing microorganisms, e. g. of the Xanthomonas genus, in a two stage process. In the first stage, growth of the microorganism is favoured, e. g. by using a predetermined quantity of a carbon containing nutrient which does not support biosynthesis of the polysaccharide. In the second stage, the conditions are such that biosynthesis of the polysaccharide takes place with substantially no growth of the microorganism, e. g. by adding carbohydrate in the absence of nutrient required for polysaccharide growth. By this process, the requirement for oxygen is greatly reduced at the time when the culture medium has its highest viscosity, thereby minimizing problems of low oxygen transfer capability in viscous media.
