# Video display control circuitry.

## Abstract
A multilevel video display control circuit. A plurality of current levels are developed in response to coded com mand signals P1, P2, P3 . The generated currents are summed together and converted to analog voltage signals V25 to control the brightness of the pixels on the display. A contrast adjustment netword 26 includes a first poten tiometer K1 for setting the magnitude of one of the cur rents at a desired level. A second potentiometer K2 is provided for varying the magnitudes of the other current levels while maintaining the first current at the present a magnitude. Preferably, the magnitude of the first current is inversely varied with respect to other current levels.
