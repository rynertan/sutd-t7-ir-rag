## Description
APPARATUS AND MET ROD FOR OPTICALLY RECORDING AN INFORMSTION SIGNAL WITH REDUCED SECOND HARMONIC DISTORTION AND A RECORD SO MADE This invention relates generally to systems for recording an information signal on an optical record medium, and, one object is to enable a signal to be recorded in such a manner that it can be subsequently recovered with reduced second harmonic distortion. Systems of this type are of particular use in recording signals such as frequency modulated video carrier signals on a recording medium such as an optically readable disc. Typically, a write beam of light is modulated in intensity in accordance with a signal to be recorded, and the modulated beam is then focused onto the disc as the disc is rotated at a prescribed angular velocity. The intensity of the beam is alternately greater than and less than a predetermined threshold at which an optical characteristic such as reflectivity of the disc is affected, so a sequence of spaced, non reflective indicia, arranged in a spiral or concentric circle pattern is formed on the disc.The recorded signal can be recovered by playback apparatus in which a read beam of light is directed onto the disc as the disc is rotated at a prescribed angular velocity, such that the beam is reflected in accordance with the recorded pattern of spaced, nonreflective indicia. The reflected beam is then detected in a suitable photocell. In one system, a portion of the write beam of light, which has been modulated in intensity by aPockels cell and related Glan prism, is monitored by a special circuit for measuring duty cycle. The circuit produces a corresponding pair of dc bias signals for coupling to the Pockels cell, to controllably adjust the duty cycle of its modulation. Although the control system described above is effective in many situations, it has not proven completely satisfactory in ensuring that the signal is actually recorded on the record medium with a proper duty cycle. This is because variations in the peak intensity of the write beam of light, along with irregularities in certain characteristics of the recording medium, neither of which is controlled by the special duty cycle measuring circuit, can adversely affect the duty cycle of the signal actually recorded on the disc. The video input will often be constituted by a frequency modulated carrier signal, and one cycle of the carrier signal will correspond to the period at which the modulated write beam has an intensity greater than the predetermined threshold together with the next period at which it has an intensity less than the predetermined threshold. It has been discovered that there will be a minimum of second harmonic distortion during replay, if the modulated write beam has a 50 duty cycle, that is to say if the average duration of the periods in each cycle at which the intensity of the modulated write beam is greater than the threshold at which the optical characteristic of the medium is modified, is on average equal to half the length of a carrier frequency cycle. One approach to the problem of minimising second harmonic distortion is a system in which a carrier signal recovered from a data carrier i.e. an optical recording medium is passed through a differential amplifier, where it is compared to a prescribed threshold. The threshold is controllably adjusted such that the signal output by the differential amplifier has a duty cycle of substantially 50 , thereby minimising second harmonic distortion. Although this system is generally effective in removing second harmonic distortion from the recovered carrier signals,it is nevertheless desirable to have the duty cycle of the signal actually recorded on the disc as close to 50 as possible, thereby reducing the amount of correction that must be effected to the recovered signal and possibly even obviating the need for any such correction at all. It will thus be appreciated from the foregoing that there is a definite need for a system for recording a signal on a recording medium, in which the duty cycle of the recorded signal is controllably adjusted such that the signal can be subsequently recovered from the medium with reduced second harmonic distortion. The present invention fulfills this need. According to the present invention, apparauts for recording an information signal, such as a modulated carrier signal, on a movable optical recording medium, comprises means 17,19 for modulating the intensity of a write beam of light 13 in accordance with the information signal to be recorded to have an intensity alternately greater than and less than a predetermined threshold at which an optical characteristic of the medium is modified means 21 for focusing the modulated write beam onto the recording medium as the medium is moved with respect thereto, whereby a sequence of spaced indicia, representative of the information signal, will be formed in the medium said means for focusing being arranged also to focus a read beam of light 61 onto the recording medium at a location trailing the write beam, to interact with the medium to produce a modulated read beam 69 having an intensity modulated by the recorded sequence of spaced indicia a monitor 83 of the modulated read beam for producing a control signal 85 dependent on the duty cycle of the modulated read beam, and arranged to adjust the duty cycle of the modulated write beam. The ratio of the mean duration of the period at which the intensity of the modulated write beam is greater than the predetermined threshold to the mean duration of that period together with the next period at which the intensity is less than the predetermined threshold is called in this specification the duty cycle of the modulated write beam. The modulated read beam will have periods of one intensity corresponding to the lengths of the spaced indicia, alternating with periods of another intensity corresponding to the lengths of the spaces between the indicia. The ratio of the mean duration of a period at the one intensity to the mean duration of the period together with the next period at the other intensity is called in the specification the duty cycle of the modulated read beam. Preferably the recording apparatus includes second harmonic detector means for monitoring the intensity signal and producing a bias control signal, indicative of the duty cycle of the intensity signal.The bias control signal can be coupled to the writing means to controllably adjust the write beam modulator and thereby appropriately configure the resultant sequence of spaced indicia, such that the information signal can be subsequently recovered by playback apparatus, with reduced second harmonic distortion. Alternately, the bias control signal can be coupled to the write laser to controllably adjust its power level, accordingly. As a result, the peak intensity of the modulated write beam is regulated such that the resultant pattern of spaced indicia likewise has a duty cycle corresponding to that of the original information signal. An embodiment in which the peak intensity of the write beam is not regulated by the bias control signal, the recording of a 50 duty cycle signal will sometimes be effected by a write beam having a duty cycle other than 50 . The invention includes a method of recording an information signal on a movable optical recording medium 11 in which the intensity of a write beam of light 13 is modulated in accordance with the information signal to have an intensity alternately greater than and less than a predetermined threshold at which an optical characteristic of the medium is modified, the modulated write beam is focused onto the recording medium, and the medium is moved with respect to it to form on the medium a sequence of spaced indicia representative of the periods when the write beam intensity is greater than the threshold a read beam of light 61 is focused onto the recording medium at a location trailing the write beam to produce a modulated read beam 69 the read beam is monitored to produce a control signal 85 dependent on its duty cycle and the control signal is used to adjust the duty cycle of the modulated write beam. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways, and two embodiment will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a simplified block diagram of apparatus in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, for recording a video signal on an optical recording disc FIGURE 2 is a block diagram of recording apparatus in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention FIGURE 3 is a simplified block diagram of the second harmonic detector utilised in the embodiments of both FIGURES 1 and 2 and FIGURE 4 is an exemplary timing diagram depicting a set of waveforms present in the second harmonic detector of FIGURE 3. Referring now to the drawings and particularly to FIGURE 1, there is shown apparatus for recording a video signal on a rotatable optical recording disc 11. The apparatus operates to focus an intensity modulated write beam of light 13 onto the disc, as the disc is rotated at a prescribed angular velocity. The intensity of the modulated write beam is alternately greater than and less than a predetermined threshold at which the reflectivity of the disc is modified, whereby a sequence of spaced, substantially non reflective indicia, representative of the modulated video signal, is formed in the disc. The write beam 13 is produced by a write laser 15 and is modulated in intensity by a Pockels cell 17 and an associated Glan prism 19. The modulated beam is then focused onto the rotating disc 11 by anObjective lens 21, which is mounted on a radially movable carriage 23. The video signal to be recorded on the disc is supplied on line 25 to a frequency modulator 27 for conventional frequencyinodulation, and in turn over line 29 to a Pockels cell driver 31, which approri ately conditions the modulated signal for coupling to the Pockels cell 17. The frequency modulated signal has a nominal duty cycle of 50 . The optical recording disc 11 is rotated at a substantially constant angular velocity by a spindle motor 33, and the radially movable lens carriage 23 is moved, simultaneously, in a radial direction at a prescribed constant velocity by a translation motor 35, whereby the intensity modulated write beam 13 traces a succession of substantially circular recording tracks that form a spiral pattern on the disc. The relative speeds of both the spindle motor and the translation motor are synchronized by a crystal oscillator 37, which produces control signals for coupling over lines 39 and 41 to the two motors, respectively. The duty cycle of the intensity modulated write beam of light 13 is controllably adjusted to be substantially the sane as that of the frequency modu lated video signal, i.e., 50 , using a special beam splitting mirror 43, a photocell 45, a preamplifier 46, and a second harmonic detector B 47. The mirror is disposed in the path of the modulated beam and is adapted to transmit a small portion of the beam to the photocell, which produces a corresponding electrical signal. The electrical signal is transmitted over line 49 from the photocell to the preamplifier, and in turn over line 50 to the detector B, which monitors the duty cycle of the signal and produces a corresponding dc bias signal E for coupling to the Pockels cell 17.Specifically, the bias signal is coupled over line 51 to a suinrer 53 where it is summed with the frequency modulated carrier signal supplied on line 55 from thePockels cell driver 31. The sum of the two signals is then coupled over line 57 from the summer to thePockels cell 17, to controllably adjust the cell accordingly, whereby the duty cycle of the modulated beam is regulated to be substantially 502. The recording apparatus of FIG. 1 further includes a read laser 59 for producing a read beam of light 61 that is focused by the objective lens 21 onto the disc 11 at a location trailing that of the inten sity ,odulated write beam 13 by a relatively small amount, preferably about 10 microns. The read beam has a substantially constant intensity, substantially less than the predeternzined threshold at which the reflectivity of the disc is affected. The read beam is transmitted through a first beam splitter 63 and, in turn, a fixed mirror 65, to the lens carriage 23, where it is combined with the intensity modulated write beam in a second beall splitter G7. The read beam 61 is reflected by tsle rotating disc 11 in accordance with tlle recorded pattern of spaced, non reflective indicia, to yield an intensity modulated reflected beam 59 that is collected by the objective lens 21 and directed back along the sane oath as the unmodulated read bean until it reaches the first beam splitter 63, where it is redirected at a read after write photocell 71.The recording apparatus further includes a preamplifier 73 and a frequency demodulator 75, and the electrical signal produced by the read after write photocell, corresponding to the modulated intensity of the reflected read beam, is transmitted over line 77 to the preamplifier for anlrlification, and, in turn, over line 79 to the frequency demodulator for denlodulation. The resultant baseband video signal is output on line 81, for coupl ing to a suitable video monitor not shown . In accordance with the invention, the recording apparatus further includes a second harmonic detector A 83 for monitoring the signal output by the preamplifier 73 and for producing a d.c. bias signal A representative of the duty cycle of the signal. This bias signal is therefore indicative of the second harmonic distortion in the preamplifier output signal and, accordingly, in the actual pattern of spaced, non reflective indicia in the disc 11. The bias signalA is coupled over line 85 to the write laser 15 to controllably adjust the power level of the write beam 13, such that the recorded pattern has a duty cycle of substantially 508 and second harmonic distortion is mininized. This continuous regulation of the intensity of the write beam 13 insures that even though there are variations in the velocity of the disc 11 relative to the write beam, and even though there might be slight variations in the duty cycle of the modulated write befall or localized variations in the sensitivity of the disc to the write beard, the pattern of spaced, nonreflective indicia actually recorded on the disc will always have a duty cycle of substantially 50 . As a result, the signal can be recovered from replicas of the disc by playback apparatus not shown with a minimum of second harmonic distortion. It will be appreciated that since the tangential velocity of the disc 11 relative to the write beam 13 is substantially directly proportional to the radius of the track being scanned, the peak intensity of the write beam rust be correspondingly proportional to the radius, for the duty cycle of the recorded signal to be aintained constant. Thus, the dc bias signal A produced by the second hárl.ónic detector A 83 automatically has the appearance of a ramp function, varying substantially linearly with the radius. More particularly, as shown in FIG. 3, both the second harmonic detector B 47, used in regulating the duty cycle of the write beam of light 13, and the second harmonic detector A 83, used in regulating the peak intensity of the write beam, include a hardliiter 87, a pair of low pass filters 89 and 91, and a differential amplifier 93. The analog input signal connected to each of the two second harmonic detectorsA and B is coupled to the limited to produce a pair of complementary, hard liited signals, designated by the letters A and B, and each hard limited signal is then filtered in a separate one of the two low pass filters.The filtered signals are then conpared to each other in the cifferential amplifier to produce the dc bias control signal, which is substantially directly propor tional to any deviation in the duty cycle of the analoy input signal from a nominal value of 50 . Each low pass filter 89 or 91 is . referably an C network having a bandwidth of about 1 KHZ, several orders of ma .nitude less than the average frequency of the frequency modulated video signal being recorded. FIC. z depicts the waveforms far. a few, selected signals in the second harmonic detector circuit 47 or 83 of FIG. 3, for an exemplary input signal FIG. 4 a having a duty cycle of about 30 .The two complementary, hard limited signals output by the limiter 87 are shown in FIGS. 4 b and c , and it can be seen that whenever the analoy input signal has a voltae greater than its average value, the limiter output signal A is at a prescribed, positive voltage V, while the limiter output signal e is substantially zero volts, and, conversely, when the analog input signal is less than its average value, the lilaiter output signalA is at zero volts, while the limiter output signal 5 is at the prescribed, positive voltage V. The filtered signals output by the respective low pass filters 89 and 91 are depicted in FIGS. 4 d and e . It will be observed that the output of the filter 39 is a dc level of about .3V, since its input signal FIC. t b has a duty cycle of about 30 , and that the output of the filter 91 is a dc level of about .7V, since its input signal Fig. 4 c has a duty cycle of about 704. FIG. 4 f depicts the resulting de bias control signal produced by the differential amplifier 93 when the two filtered signals FIGS. 4 d and e are coupled to its input terminals. In the case of the second harmonic detector A ,3, the bias control signal FIG. 4 f is coupled to the write laser 15 such that the power level of the write beam 13 is controllably adjusted to bring the duty cycle of the reflected read beam 69, and thus the recorded pattern of spaced, non reflective indicia, back to a nominal value of 50 . Similarly, in the case of the second harmonic detector B 47, the bias control signal is coupled to the Pockels cell 17 such that the duty cycle of the intensity modulated write beam is controllably adjusted back to a nominal value of 50 .It will be appreciated that when the analog input signal applied to either of the two second harmonic detectors has a duty cycle of 50 , the two conplementary, hard lilaiteG signals output by the limiter 87 will likewise have a duty cycle of 50 and the dc bias signal output by the differential amplifier will be substantially zero volts. In another embodiment of the invention not shown in the drawings , the write beam 13 is mociulated in intensity by an acoustic modulator, as contrasted with the Pockels cell 17 FIG. 1 . This obviates the need for the feedback control system that includes the second harmonic detector B 47, for regu latin J the duty cycle of the modulated bears, since an acoustic modulator inherently yields a beam modulated witt, a auti cycle of 500. As in the etbodi ent of FIG. 1, however, the duty cycle of the pattern of spaced, non reflective indicia actually recorded on the disc 11 is controllably adjusted to be substantially 50 using tie second harmonic detector A 83, for reyulating the power of the write beam. Referring now to FIG. 2, there is shown still another embodiment of recording apparatus in accordance with the present invention. In EIG. 2, elements corresponding to those included in the embodiment ofFIG. 1, previously described, are designated by corresponding, primed numerals. In this embodiment, the duty cycle of the intensity modulated write bears 13 , as contrasted kith the power level of tne beam, is regulated using the dc bias signal A produced by the second harmonic detector A 83 , such that the recorded pattern of spaced, non reflective indicia as a duty cycle of substantially 50 .Any deviation from 5O in the duty cycle of the recorded signal is detected by the second harmonic detector A, which continuously monitors the intensity of the reflected read beam 63 , and the resultant bias signal A is proportional to this deviation. This bias signal A is coupled to the Pockels cell 17 through the summer 53 , to controllably adjust the duty cycle of the modulated write beam. The power level of the write beam 13 is controllably adjusted to be approximately directly proportional to the tangential velocity of the recording disc 11 relative to the write beam, whereby tile lower of the beam per unit area on the disc is main tained substantially constant ovur the entire disc.This power level adjustment is effected Ly a potentiometer 95 coupled to the translation motor 35 for Loving the lens carriage 23 radially relative to the disc. The potentiometer is appropriately connected to produce a control signal directly proportional to the radius of the recordiny track being scanned, ana this control signal is coupled over line 57 to the write laser 15 , to controllably adjust its power level, accordingly.Any deviation from a precise linear relationship between the peak intensity of the write beam and the radius of the track being scanned is compensated for by the second harnonic detector a. 83 , which automatically adjusts t ne duty cycle of the bean by an amount corresponding to such deviation. It will be appreciated fro the foregoing t. t the present invention provides an irproved record in.3 apparatus for recording an information signal on a record in medium herein title duty cycle of the recorded signal is controllably adjusted to be substantially the same as that of the original information signal. This reduces the amount of correction for second harmonic distortion that tust be effected by apparatus for playing back the recorded disc or rel21i cas of the recorded disc. Although the invention has been described in detail, it will be understood by one or ordinary skill in the art that various modifications can be mdue, without departing fron the spirit and scope of the invt ntion. Accordingly, it is not intended that tite invention be limited, except as by the appended claims.
