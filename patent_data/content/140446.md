# DISPENSING CLOSURE 1111111

## Abstract
An externally mounted integral, self sealing check valve dispensing closure for use in a fluid product dispenser is described which is formed with a substantially tubular open inlet end and a normally closed outlet end of a resilient plastic or elastomer having a durometer in the range of between approximately 10 Shore A and 95 Shore A 46 Shore D and having a wall thickness in the range of from about .25 to 1.3 mm. The outlet end of the dispensing closure converges toward its closed end along an inflexed non planar surface to a normally closed non linear discharge slit. The distal edge of the inflexed non planar surface mates with at least one other, oppositely disposed surface of the closure to form the discharge slit, with these mating surfaces having substantially flat lands of contact along the slit. The inflexed non planar surface forms an acute angle at the slit with any line drawn through the slit parallel to the central axis of the closure and is adapted to resiliently deflect outwardly in response to the application of product pressure from within, thereby opening the closure and permitting product flow therethrough. Upon release of product pressure therewithin, the inverted non planar surface returns to its inflexed closed condition thereby sealing the closure.
