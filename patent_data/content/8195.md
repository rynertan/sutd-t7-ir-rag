# Orthopedic bandage and method for increasing the effective working time thereof.

## Abstract
In an orthopedic bandage which hardens by means of a free radical catalyzed polymerization reaction, wherein said bandage comprises a cast forming composition in cluding a solid water soluble vinyl monomer such as diace toneacrylamide DAA , N isopropylacrylamide N IPA or mixtures thereof, and at least one component of an impro ved redox catalyst system capable of initiating the polyme rization of such vinyl monomer, said redox catalyst system comprising a copper containing compound in combination with a reducing agent, supported on a flexible carrier, the improvement which comprises increasing the effective working time of such bandage by providing in said banda ge prior to or during polymerization thereof an alkaline earth metal salt, e.g. calcium sulfate. The copper contain ing compound may be cupric acetylacetonate.
