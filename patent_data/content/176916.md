## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF y INTERFERON This invention relates to processes for production of y interferon hereinafter referred to as IFN , to a gene coding for said IFN, to a plasmid containing said gene and to a host organism containing said plasmid, and to processes for production thereof. IFN can be induced in lumphocytes by mitogens, alloantigens and other substances as well as being induced in sensitized lymphocytes by specific antigens.Biologically, IFN is a very interesting lymphokine with important immunoregulation properties. Moreover, IFN has been shown to have significant antitumor activity against mouse sarcomas. However, tests in the treatment of viral diseases and cancer have been severely restricted by its very limited availability. There exists a need for a commercial production of IFN,and such a requirement stimulate the accomplishment of this invention. It was perceived that the application of recombinantDNA and associated technologies would be a most effective way of producing large quantities of IFN. IFN is known to consist of 146 amino acids in the following sequence 1 10 Cys Tyr Cys Gln Asp Pro Tyr Val Lys Glu Als Glu 20Asn Leu Lys Lys Tyr Phe Asn Gly His Ser Asp Val 30Ala Asp Asn Gly Thr Leu Phe Leu Gly Ile Leu Lys Asn 40 50Trp Lys Glu Glu Ser Asp Arg Lys Ile Met Gln Ser Gln 60Ile Val Ser Phe Tyr Phe Lys Leu Phe Lys Asn Phe Lys 70 Asp Asp Gln Ser Ile Gln Lys ser Val Glu Thr Ile Lys 80 90Glu Asp Met Asn Val Lys Phe Phe Asn Ser Asn Lys Lys 100Lys Arg Asp Asp Phe Glu Lys Leu Thr Asn Tyr Ser Val 110 Thr Asp Leu Asn Val Gln Arg Lys Ala I le Ili s Glu Leu 120Ile Gln Val Met Ala Glu Leu Ser Pro Ala Ala Lys Thr130 140Gly Lys Arg Lys Arg Ser Gln Met Leu Phe Gln Gly Arg 146Arg Ala Ser Gln The inventors of this invention succeeded in producing a large amount of IFN by using the following essential steps.Step 1 A process for the production of a gene coding forIFN hereinafter referred to as IFN gene which comprises linking a gene coding for the left hand of IFN hereinafter referred to as IFN LH with a gene coding for the right hand of IFN hereinafter referred to as IFN RH . Suitable gene in the term IFN gene may include the ones as exemplified hereinafter and the like.Step 2 A process for the production of an expression vector which comprises inserting a promoter gene and IFN gene into a plasmid. Suitable expression vector may include plasmid pytrp and the like. Suitable plasmid may include pBR322 and the like.Step 3 Aprocess for the production of a transformant which comprises transforming a host organism with said expression vector. Suitable host organism may include Escherichia hereinafter referred to as E. colt e. g. E. coli HB101, etc. and the like.Step4 A process for the production of IFN which comprises culturing said transformant in a suitable medium. From th above amino acid sequence of IFN, a corresponding nucleotide sequence of ZFN gene has been invented, subject to a number of specific non obvious criteria. IFN gene has been constructed in two portions.One is a gene coding for the left hand of IFN hereinafter referred to as IFN LH gene and the other is a gene coding for the right hand of IFN hereinafter referred to as IFN RS gene . The IFN LH gene is cloned by inserting it into a known plasmid, as a cloning vector and transformed to a host organism from which the plasmid having IFN LH gene has been isolated. Thus obtained plasmid having IFN LH is used as a cloning vector of IFNRH gene. That is, IFN RH gene is inserted downstream of and adjacent to IFN LH gene, and transformed to a host organism , from which the plasmid having IFN gene is isolated. IFN gene is isolated from the plasmid havingIFN gene. Thus obtained IFN gene is inserted into a plasmid specifically designed to maximize expression of the IFN gene under the control of a promoter. Although the present invention is illustrated in detail hereinafter, the present invention is not limited thereto. 1 Preparation and cloning of a IFN gene 1 Preparation of a IFN LH gene and a IFN RH gene The present invention also relates to a IFN LH gene and IFN RH gene. From the above amino acid sequence, because of the diversity of the genetic code, it is possible to predict numerous nucleotide sequences which would code for theIFN LH gene or IFN RH gene. In the inventive determination of an optimum sequence from the large number of possibilities, several non obvious criteria have been observed. Firstly, trinucleotide codons should be used which are acceptable in a host organism to be used. Secondly, it should be desirable to have different restriction enzyme recognition sites at the terminal of the molecule so as to allow insertion into plasmid in a desired orientation. Moreover, it should be decided to select sites which will be allowed to use well known cloning vectors.Thirdly, the synthesis should not be unnecessarily complicated, and illegitimate cross hybridization should be minimized in order to facilitate gene assembly, so that stable off diagonal interactions might be avoided as far as possible. Considering the above mentioned criteria, particularly in consideration of the second criteria mentioned above, the following slightly longer sequence can be selected.Structure of IFN LH gene IFN LH gene codes for the 1st to the 73rd amino acids of fFN. As a suitable embodiment of this invention, coRI and BamHI sites was selected and introduced at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively, and further HindIII site was selected and introduced over lysine 58th amino acid and leucine 59th amino acid thereof. Further, a methionine codon ATG was inserted upstream of and adjacent to the N terminal amino acid codon of IFN, and three stop codons TAA, TGA and TAG were inserted downstream of and adjacent to theC terminal codon. The one of the preferred sequence selected for the coding for portion of the IFN LH gene can be shown as follows EcoRI Met Cys Tyr Cys Gln Asp Pro Tyr Coding 5 AATTC ATG TGT TAC TGC CAG GAC CCA TAT Noncoding 3 G TAC ACA ATG ACG GTC CTG GGT ATA 10 20Val Lys Glu Ala Glu Asn Leu Lys Lys Tyr Phe Asn Ala Gly GTA AAA GAA GCA GAA AAC CTT AAG AAA TAC TTT AAT GCA GGT CAT TTT CTT CGT CTT TTG GAA TTC TTT ATG AAA TTA CGT CCA 30His Ser Asp Val Ala Asp Asn Gly Thr Leu Phe Leu Gly Ile CAT TCA GAT GTA GCG GAT AAT GGA ACT CTT TTC TTA GGC ATT GTA AGT CTA CAT CGC CTA TTA CCT TGA GAA AAG AAT CCG TAA 40Leu Lys Asn Trp Lys Glu Glu Ser Asp Arg Lys Ile Met Gln RTI ID 7.4 TTG AAG AAT TGG AAA GAG GAG AGT GAC AGA AAA ATA ATG CAG AAC TTC TTA ACC TTT CTC CTC TCA CTG TCT TTT TAT TAC GTC 50 HindIII 60Ser Gln Ile Val Ser Phe Tyr Phe Lys Leu Phe Lys Asn Phe AGC CAA ATT GTC TCC TTT TAC TTC AAG CTT TTC AAA AAC TTT TCG GTT TAA CAG AGG AAA ATG AAG TTC GAA AAG TTT TTG AAA 70Lys Asp Asp Gln Ser Ile Gln Lys Ser Val Stop Stop BamHIAAG GAT GAC CAG AGC ATC CAA AAG AGT GTG TAA TGA TAG TTC CTA CTG GTC TCG TAG GTT TTC TCA CAC ATT ACT ATCCTAG Structure of IFN RH gene IFN RH gene codes for the 60th to the 146th amino acids of IFN.

Crea et al, Nucleic Acid Research 8, 2331 1980 and M. L. Duckworth et al, NucleicAcid Research, 9, 1691 1981 . Particularly, the synthetic methods will now be illustrated with reference to the synthesis of the hexadecanucleotide HOApTpCpApCpTpTpGpGpApTpGpApGpTpTOH H6 described in Example 1. The flow chart of the synthesis of the hexadecanucleotide H6 is shown in Fig.2. b Hybridization and ligation of chemically synthesized oligonucleotide i IFN LH gene The oligonucleotides are hybridized and ligated in a series of steps, in order to minimize the possibilities for undesirable interactions as shown in Fig. 3. In Fig.3, an oligonucleotide is illustrated with or means 5 phosphorylated end , and blocked oligonucleotides are illustrated, for example, e means ligated position . Ligation is conducted in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. Oligonucleotides Al to A6, B1 to B6, Cl to C6, D1,D2, D4 and D5, D3, El, E2, D6, E4 and E5, E3, L1, L2 andL3 were hybridized and ligated to give blocks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Block 2 and Block 3, and Block 4 and Block 5 were hybridized and ligated to give Blocks 7 and 8, respectively. Blocks 1 and 7, and blocks 6 and 8 were hybridized and ligated to give an objective polynucleotide IFN LH gene. ii IFN RH gene The oligonucleotides D3, D6, El to E6, Fl to F6, G1 to G6, Hl to H6, I1 to I6, J1 to J6 are hybridized and ligated by a similar manner to that of IFN LH gene. Thus obtained ligated mixture was cleaved with HindIII to give an objective polynucleotide IFN RH gene. This process is shown in Fig. 4. IFN RH gene is prepared by a similar manner to that of IFN LH gene. 2 Molecular cloning of the IFN gene In order to clone the IFN LH gene, it is inserted into an appropriate plasmid, cloning vector, having suitable enzyme recognition sites in which the IFN LH gene can be inserted. As a suitable embodiment of this invention IFN LH gene synthesized for the expression in E. colt was inserted into a plasmid originated in E. colt e. g.pBR322, etc. and cloning was conduced. For example, in case using a plasmid p3R322 havingEcoRI and BamHI sites, as shown in Fig. 5, the plasmid was cleaved by EcoRI and BamHI. In this case the plasmid has ampicillin resistance code it is indicated by Amp on the longer fragment when cleaved by EcoRI and BamHI, and tetracycline resistance code it is indicated by Tet vanishes in consequence of the cleavage of BamHI site.The longer fragment of EcoRI, BamHI cleavd plasmid pBR322 was purified by electroelution, hybridized and ligated with a large excess of the IFN tH gene using T4DNA ligase. Thus obtained mixture was transformed into E.coli HB101. The plasmid was isolated from one of the obtained several ampicillin resistant and tetracycline sensitive transformants and confirmed to contain IFN LH gene by digestion with restriction enzyme and electrophoresis. Thus obtained plasmid is named as plasmid pLH107. Then, the plasmid pLH107was cleaved by HindIII andBamHI. In this case the plasmid has ampicillin resistance code it is indicated by Amp on the longer fragment when cleaved by HindIII and BamHI, and tetracycline resistance code it is indicated by Tet vanishes in consequence of the cleavage of BamHI site. The longer fragment ofHindIII, BamHI cleaved plasmid pLH107 was purified by electroelution, hybridized and ligated with a large excess of the IFN RH gene using T4 DNA ligase. Thus obtained mixture was transformed into E. coli HB101. The plasmid was isolated from one of the obtained several ampicillin resistant and tetracycline sensitive transformants and confirmed to contain IFN gene by digestion with restriction enzyme and electrophoresis.This process is shown in Fig. 5. Thus obtained plasmid is named as plasmid pyF 3. 2 Preparation and cloning of a promoter gene To obtain IFN from a host organism, a promoter gene which had a certain structural gene was designed. A promoter gene obtained by such a criteria is inserted into a plasmid, and then IFN gene is inserted therein in a style that the promoter gene is located upstream of and adjacent to the IFN gene. 1 Preparation and cloning of a trp promoter I gene Structure of trp promoter I gene As a suitable embodiment of this invention, the following type of a promoter hereinafter referred to trp promoter I was planned.

To the cells the dilution solution containing IFN was added and incubated at 370C overnight in the 5 CO2 incubator. After removing the IFN solution the incubation buffer was changed with Eagle s MEM, and then Sindvis virus 106 ffu ml, 0.1 ml siluted with Eagle s MEM contining 0.05 BSA was added. After incubation for 24 hours at 370 C in 3 CO2 incubator, the cells were fixed with 10 formalin, and then colored with 0.1 crystal violet solution.Activity IU ml of IFN was determined from the observed value U ml based on NIH international reference standard LeuHuIFNa, G023 901 527 .
