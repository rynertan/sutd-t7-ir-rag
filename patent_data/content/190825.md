# ELONGATE BUILDING ELEMENT

## Abstract
An element 110 , e.g. for a window frame has a load bearing member 12 e.g. of aluminium which pro vides a flange 20 and a cladding member 14 of thin walled, flexible plastics whose flexibility allows it to snap engage with the flange 20 by means of formations 22 40 and 32,34 48,50 to define a channel 16 . This channel 16 has a filling 18 which resists flexing of the cladding member 14 . The filling 18 is preferably a solid foam produced by expansion of a composition 400 within the cavity 16 , the cladding member being supported during the expansion to prevent distortion. Thus the members 12,14 may be partially 22 40 engaged and receive the foam composition 400 within the cladding member 14 , then pass through a gap 409 between the conveyors 408,410 which squeeze the assembly to effect the snap engagement and to provide the support.
