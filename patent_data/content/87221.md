# Method for reducing ignition delay of fuels.

## Abstract
A method of reducing ignition delay, Ï„, of fuels to negligible values and negligible differences is disclosed. Fuels conditioned to have such negligible values and differences are readily used in multiple fuel engines, such fuels self ignite substantially instantaneously when injected into an oxidant, require substantially no heat transfer from the oxidant to effect the self ignition, and the self ignition is sufficient to sustain continued combustion.
