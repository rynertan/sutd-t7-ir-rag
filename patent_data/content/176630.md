# Liquid developer for development of electrostatic images.

## Abstract
A liquid developer composition that is suitable for rendering visible electrostatically charged areas, which com position contains in an electrically insulating non polar carrier liquid having a volume resistivity of at least 10‚Åπ ohm.cm and a dielectric constant less than 3, dispersed colouring matter acting as toner particles and at least one anionic addition polymer comprising anionic groups neutral ized with non polymeric counter cations, characterized in that said cations are positively charged metal ion containing coordination compounds.
