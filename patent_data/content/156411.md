# Darlington transistor arrangement.

## Abstract
The emitter of an input transistor T₁ of a Darlington tran sistor is connected to the base of an output transistor T₂ . The collector of the input transistor T₁ is connected to the input of a current amplifier circuit comprising a third tran sistor T₃ arranged as a diode and having a first resistor R₁ arranged in its emitter circuit, and a fourth transistor T₄ having its base is connected to that of the third transistor T₃ and having a second resistor R₂ arranged in the emitter circuit. The collector of the fourth transistor T₄ is connected to the base of the output transistor T₂ . The ratio between the resistance values of the first and the second resistors R₁, R₂ is larger than the ratio between the emitter areas of the fourth and the third transistor T₄, T₃ . Thus, for small currents a low and for large currents a high current gain is obtained, so that the current gain factor of the output transistor T₂ which decreases for large currents is compensated for partly. Moreover, the base current of the input transistor T₁ remains small in the case of large output currents.
