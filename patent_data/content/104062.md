# Automatic weighing and packing methods and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
Batches of goods, having a weight equal or close to a target weight within predetermined allowable limits, are weighed out and packed into a receptacle. To avoid undesir able variations in volume between the batches, pressure is applied to the goods in the receptacle in order to reduce the volume occupied to a permissible value. The pressure used in packing the batches is monitored and the target weight changed, as between one weighing out operation and the next in dependence upon results obtained previously from the monitoring, with a view to maintaining within predeter mined limits the packing pressures used.
