# Process for the electrolytic production of fluorine and novel cell therefor.

## Abstract
A cell and process is provided for the production of fluorine comprising electrolyzing a liquid mixture of fluo rides of alkali metal, ammonium and hydrogen fluoride. The cell anode 25 comprises a stock of anode plates 30 with internal passages 32 or it may comprise a carbon shape provided with grooves and passages and fitted to a central conductor 31 which conducts current from the exterior of the cell to the carbon anode plates within the cell. The anode having a substantially expanded working surface has the capability of removing fluorine internally. A louvered cath ode 23 permits most of the hydrogen to be vented away from the zone between the electrodes through which current passes thus reducing the ohmic voltage loss. The cathode, rather than being louvered, can be expanded metal or punched sheet or gauze. The anode, cathode and barrier 27 may be cylindrical in form although other shapes, for instance rectangular or square in cross section or even of hexagonal section, may be used if desired. Combination of the segmented anode design with a louvered cathode provides a unique cell for fluorine production because virtu ally the same electrolysis condition exists at any part of the anode and cathode.
