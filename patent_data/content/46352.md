# A bag type filter apparatus having air diffuser tubes of helical construction.

## Abstract
A bag type filter apparatus, whose elongate tubular filter bags 14 are supported by tubular cages 26 therewithin, is provided with an air diffuser tube 30 extending longitudinally within each tubular cage 26 for diffusing and distributing a periodic reverse purge air flow throughout each filter bag 14 to dislodge from the exterior surface of each filter bag particu late material which normally collects on the filter bags. Each air diffuser tube 30 is formed from a perforate strip of helically wound sheet metal, adjacent edges of which are interconnect ed by an imperforate seam 36 in which such adjacent edges overlap each other in interlocking relationship so that the seam extends helically around the respective air diffuser tube.
