# Hanging dot reduction system.

## Abstract
A control signal generator 60 is responsive to the output of a pair of correlation indicators 40, 50 . One correlation indicator 40 provides an indication of the presence or absence of correlation between high frequency components derived without difference in delay from the respective luminance and chromi nance outputs of a composit color signal comb filter system 11, 3, 15, 19, 21, 27, 17 . The other correlation indicator 50 provides an indication of the presence or absence of correlation between high frequency components derived with a difference in delay 52 from the respective comb filter outputs, the delay difference corresponding to a quarter period at the nominal color subcarrier frequency. A control signal SC is developed in response to a correlation indication by either or both of the indicators. The luminance output of the comb filter, subjected to high frequency component removal 31 is selected B, 25 during control signal development.
