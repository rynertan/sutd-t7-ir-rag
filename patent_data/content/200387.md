# Power booster.

## Abstract
A hydraulic power booster has its booster piston return spring formed as a tubular conduit 120 to communicate hydraulic supply pressure to a chamber 158 under the control of a closed centre valve arrangement 142 . Upon booster actuation, the valve arrangement opens to permit supply pressure to flow into the booster power chamber 100 , and by valving action controls the exhaust of pressure from the power chamber so as to establish the desired actuating pressure therein. The use of a tubular conduit to form the power piston return spring and also communicate the supply pressure to the closed centre valve permits a shorter overall axial length of the hydraulic booster, by accommodating the movement of the supply pressure chamber at the closed centre valve. It also provides for reduced leakage of charged supply press ure by accommodating a better pressure seal arrangement.
