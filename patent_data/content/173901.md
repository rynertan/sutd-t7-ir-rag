# Process to make small crystallites of ZSM 5.

## Abstract
ZSM 5 crystallites having dimensions below about 0.3 micrometer are produced in the as synthesized form with very low levels of blocking tetrapropyl ammonium Q ions. The reaction mixture contains sources of silica, soda, alumina, a polyol such as ethylene glycol and trace amounts of Q ions as nucleation agents. Because the crystallites as synthesized from the aqueous medium exhibit only a small fraction of blocking cations, there is always a diffusion path for the hydrated sodium ions to be exchanged without the need of prior removal of the blocking cations by calcination or otherwise. The small size crystallites can be exchanged, blended with matrix material, and formed into catalyst particles. The silica to alumina ratio can be varied and when no aluminium is added, silicalite may be formed. The synthesis can be done in 24 hours or less.

## Description
Field of the Invention This invention relates to a process to make small crystallites of the zeolite ZSM 5 which can be directly ion exchanged without requiring calcination of the as crystallized product.Background of the Invention The synthetic zeolite ZSM 5 has been described byArqauer et al in U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886 and by many others since 1972. ZSM 5 is a zeolite which crystallizes in the orthorhombic system with unit cell dimensions of about an 20.1 Angstrom units b0 19.8 Angstrom units, and cO 13.4 Angstrom units The unit cell contains 96 atoms of silicon and aluminum, each tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen which are often referred to as silicon and aluminum tetrahedrons also silica and alumina tetrahedrons .AS pointed out in the basic Arqauer et al patent, silicon can be replaced with germanium and aluminum can be replaced with gallium to still obtain ZSM 5. As used herein the term silica is to include qermania and mixtures of germania and silica and the term alumina is to include gallia and mixtures of qallia and alumina. The proportion of silicon to aluminum mav vary depending on composition. For example, a ZSM 5 product with a SiO2 to Awl 203 mole ratio of 46 1 will contain, on averaqe, 92 silicon and 4 aluminum tetrahedrons per unit cell. These tetrahedrons form a riqid covalent framework. The zeolite may contain other substances or ions which are not part of the framework.For example, it may include cations, water, organic molecules, hydroxyl ions or gases. These substances are present in the pores within the crystal structure. ZSM 5 crystals are traversed by two sets of channels or pores.A set of essentially straight pores which run parallel to the wbw axis and a set of pores which zigzag or undulate in the direction parallel to the waw axis. The two sets of pores or channels intersect on a regular and repetitive manner such that each unit cell includes four such intersections. Thus, a typical unit cell can be represented in simple terms by the following symbolic notation EMI2.1 Formula 1 in which M represents monovalent cations such as alkali metals, organic bases, or H represents the pore intersections, and the other symbols have their usual chemical meaning. Note that the summation of silicon and aluminum equals 96 the number of tetrahedrons per unit cell and that the number of monovalent cations equals the number of aluminum atoms. One can further refine the symbolic representation of a typical unit cell by indicatinq the presence of organic bases such as, for example, normal tetrapropyl ammonium ion n C H Ni hereinafter designated by the letter Q, which, because of its size and shape, is centered in the intersections unable to move within the riqid framework and, therefore, blocking diffusion or flow of other molecular species or ions. The representation takes the followinq form EMI2.2 Formula 2 in which EMI3.1 represents the open intersections which are either empty or filled with small molecules or ions which are capable of and allow diffusion or flow through the channels and intersections, andEMI3.2 represents those intersections which are occupied by large, fixed ions such as tetrapropyl ammonium which block diffusion and flow through those intersections. Note that the summation of open and blocked intersections is four.Although Formula 2 does not include all of the components of the ZSM 5 zeolite in each and every of its possible forms, it includes all of its key functional components. Formula 2 provides the following important information the silica to alumina mole ratio R 2 96 x x the number of blockinq templates per unit cell y, the number of intersections per unit cell 4, the fraction of blocked pore intersections f the particular cationic form Na , NH4, H , etc. of the zeolite, the electrical neutrality of the system, and a qeneral basis to define stoichiometric proportions in a ZSM 5 product.Under this notation x indicates the number of aluminum atoms in the unit cell and thus there will be 96 x silicon atoms since the total of these two elements is 96. There are 4 intersections for each unit cell which are represented by the 2 boxes. The one on the far right represents the number of intersections, y , filled with Q ions, and the other box represents the remaining intersections which do not contain Q ions and they number 4 y. Electrical charge neutrality is maintained since the number of monovalent cations equals the number of alumina atoms in the structure. The SiO2 to Awl 203 mole ratio in ZSM 5 can be varied and ZSM 5 zeolites have been made with very large sin2 to A1203 mole ratios. Dwyer et al in U.S.Patent No. 4,441,991 refer to high ratio zeolites disclosed in U.S. Patent No. Re 29,948 and equivalents of such zeolites, e.g., silicalite disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 4,061,724. Dwyer et al indicate the equivalency of these two zeolites is known in the art, as discussed, for example, by Fyfe et al, in Resolving CrystallographicallyDistinct Tetrahedral Sites in Silicalite and ZSM 5 bySolid State NMR, 296 Nature 530 Apr. 8, 1982 , by Rees inWhen is a Zeolite Not a Zeolite, 296 Nature 491 Apr. 8, 1982 , and by Bibby et al., in Silicalite 2, a SilicaAnaloque of the Aluminosilicate Zeolite ZSM ll, 280 Nature 664 Aug. 23, 1979 . As used herein the term ZSM 5 zeolite also includes silicalite. In the classical synthesis of ZSM 5, following the teachings of the Plank et al patent U.S. Patent No.3,926,782 , tetrapropylammonium ion Q is used as a template. Crystallization of the silica and alumina tetrahedrons takes place around the Q ions which end up occluded at the intersections of the two sets of pores.The Plank et al synthesis requires the use of large excess of Q ions in relation to the number of intersections in the resulting ZSM 5 structure. As a result, a large proportion of the Q employed ends up in solution in the mother liquor following synthesis and the remainder ends up within the crystal structure. Synibolically the Plank et al product may be represented in its key features by EMI5.1 Formula 3 in which y is nearly 4, and the degree of blocking is essentially complete. Essentially all substances or ions of appreciable size, such as for example hydrated sodium ions, will be unable to diffuse freely through the structure until the blocking Q ions are removed. Furthermore, the Q ions cannot be easily removed because their size is large, and their fit is very tight. For all practical purposes the Q ions are occluded and fixed. The only practical way to remove the occluded Q ions from the structure is to break down these large cations through pyrolysis at high temperature and or oxidation. Once the Q has been removed from the structure, the channels and intersections become open to diffusion of molecules or ions of sizes generally below about 5 Anqstroms. For example, hydrated sodium ions mav easily diffuse through an aqueous medium and be exchanged by other cations such as, for example, ammonium. Since the most common use of ZSM 5 as a catalyst is in the hydrogen form, its preparation will normally require the followinq sequence of principal steps synthesis using organic materials as the templates, high temperature calcination to remove organic blocking cations such as Q, exchange of alkali metal ions with ammonium ion, and decomposition at elevated temperature of the ammonium ion into the hydrogen form of the zeolite and gaseous ammonia. Attempts have been made to make ZSM 5 with small crystallite sizes. When used as a catalyst in hydrocarbon conversion these small size crystallites retard catalyst aging during the hydrocarbon processing reactions as disclosed by Plank et al in U.S. Patent No. 3,926,782.The zeolites in the Plank et al patent were made with either relatively large concentrations of tetrapropyl ammonium bromide QBr or a tertiary amine and an alkyl halide such as bromide which would form a tetra alkyl ammonium halide such as QBr when using tripropylamine and propylbromide. The disposal of these materials in the waste reactant mixtures presents environmental pollution problems. Furthermore, the zeolite as formed had to be calcined before being ion exchanged. Haag et al in U.S.Patent No. 4,326,994 also used large concentrations of a polyalkyl amine and an organic halide which would combine to form a tetra alkyl ammonium halide such as QBr to make small crystallites. Again, it was necessary to calcine the zeolites before they could be exchanged. In these prior systems using Q ions, the amount of Q employed was very large. For example, in the basicArgauer et al U.S. Patent No. 3,702,886 the first example uses over 1250 of the amount of Q needed to occupy all intersections on the basis of the unit cell stoichiometry of Formula 2 . ZSM 5 has also been produced from reaction systems containing seeds. Rollmann et al U.S. Patent No.4,203,869 disclosed using ZSM 5 crystals as seeds and noted that the successful crystallization required the further presence of Q, the tetrapropylammonium cation.Plank et al in U.S. Patent No. 4,175,114 used seeds alone or in combination with an alcohol. The alcohols disclosed were aliphatic alcohols and preferably containing 2 to 5 carbon atoms. Illustratively named alcohols were ethanol, propanol, butanol and pentanol. The patentees stated they contemplated that the alcohols could be straight or branched chain. There was no mention of the crystallite size obtained. ZSM 5 has also been made in a low sodium form so the zeolite need not be ion exchanged prior to use. Rubin et al in U.S. Patent No. 4,151,189 disclosed using propylamines with stirring to produce a zeolite in the as synthesized form which had less than 0.14 by weight of alkali metal. There was no discussion of the crystallite size. Plank et al in U.S. Patent No. 4,341,748 claimed an uncalcined form of ZSM 5 which was capable of substantially complete ion exchange of its original metal cations without prior calcination. The disclosure was a continuation in part of the Plank et al U.S. Patent No.4,175,114 patent discussed above with regard to seeding and it had the same examples. ZSM 5 has also been made in reaction systems which do not utilize the large 0 ion templates. Taramasso et al inU.S. Patent No. 4,431,621 disclosed the use of organic substances which contain hydroxyl functions such as alcohols and phenols and more particularly glycols and polyglycols. The patent did not give the crystallite sizes.Objects of the Invention It is an object of this invention to produce ZSM 5 crystallites having a size in their smallest dimension of below about 0.3 micrometer. It is a further object of this invention to produce small ZSM 5 crystallites using only small to trace amounts of quaternary ammonium ions as templates or nucleating agents. It is a further object to modify those known processes for making ZSM 5, which do not use tetrapropyl ammonium ions, by adding a combination of Q ions and other materials including ethylene glycol to produce ZSM 5 in submicron size crystallites. It is a further object of this invention to produceZSM 5 in the as synthesized and washed form which have large blocking organic compounds such as Q present in only a small fraction of the number of intersections in the zeolite structure. It is a further object of this invention to obtain novel ZSM 5 in the as synthesized and washed form which have large blocking organic compounds such as Q present in only a small fraction of the number of intersections in the zeolite structure. It is a further object of this invention to produceZSM 5 havinq a high degree of crystallinity. It is a further object of this invention to produceZSM 5 from raw materials of low cost. It is a further object of this invention to produceZSM 5 by a process having a high equivalent product concentration as will be defined herein. It is a further object of this invention to produceZSM 5 by a process utilizing a reactor such as an autoclave with a very large reactor throughput as will be defined herein. It is a further object of this invention to produceZSM 5 which can be ion exchanged without requiring a precalcination step. It is another object of this invention to produceZSM 5 by using a recycle process. It is a further object of this invention to produce silicalite and with the same objects as for making ZSM 5. It is a further object of this invention to produce the intended zeolites by an overall low cost process. It is a further object of this invention to blend theZSM 5 obtained with matrix material to form catalyst particles. These and further objects will become apparent as the description of the invention proceeds.Summary of the Invention By synthesizing ZSM 5 in an aqueous medium from sources of silica, soda and alumina in a specific concentration reaction mixture which contains a polyol such as ethylene glycol and with trace amounts of tetrapropyl ammonium Q ions as nucleation agents, novel crystallites having dimensions below about 0.3 micrometer can be produced which have low revels of blocking 9 ions present in the as synthesized form. Silicalite is made when the source of alumina is deleted. The trace amount of QBr employed in our process is a small fraction of the stoichiometric amount of Q ions calculated basis Formula 2 which would occupy all pore intersections within the structure. The amount used is generally less than 20 of the stoichiometric amount based on Formula 2 . For example, a product with SiO2 to Awl 203 mole ratio of 46 1 can be prepared using generally less than 0.40 mole of QBr per mole of A1203 to give a ZSM 5 represented symbolically by EMI9.1 Formula 4 Because the crystallites as synthesized from the aqueous medium exhibit only a small fraction of blocking cations, there is always a diffusion path for the sodium ions to be exchanged without a need of prior removal of the blocking cations by calcination or otherwise. Merely by water washing the zeolite, the ethylene glycol and excess NaOH may be removed from the structure. The degree of removal depends on the extent of washing. By contacting the product with a solution of an ammonium salt such as NH4NO3, the sodium ion is readily exchanged and the zeolite is essentially converted to the ammonium form.We also emphasize that the hydrothermal step of our process only takes about 8 hours or less to complete theZSM 5 synthesis. Furthermore, we also emphasize that the equivalent product concentration in the autoclaving step of our process is generally greater than 12 and often greater than 14 . The high concentration and short reaction times combine to give excellent product throughputs typically greater than 400 Kg cm3 day and more preferably greater than 500 Kg m3 day. All of which are significant improvements over prior art. Using just ethylene glycol alone does not produce the desired small size crystallites. Instead, it is necessary to have a small amount of the tetrapropylammonium ion present. The small size crystallites can be exchanged, blended with matrix material, and formed into catalyst particles.The silica to alumina ratio can be varied and when no aluminum is added, silicalite may be formed.Description of the Preferred Embodiments our new method for synthesizing the zeolite ZSM 5 is especially suitable for making small size crystallites.As described by Plank et al in U.S. Patent No. 3,926,782 very small crystallite size ZSM 5 containing catalyst results in the retardation of aging of such catalyst during various hydrocarbon conversion reactions such as upgrading of reformates, transalkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylation of aromatics, reduction in the pour point of fuel oils and in catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. When upgrading naphthas or reformates, the use of the small size crystallites has been found by Plank et al not only to retard aging of the catalyst, but also to give rise to improved yield octane through the use of decreased hydrogen to hydrocarbon ratio while retaining satisfactory aging during naphtha or reformate processing. One simple explanation as to why smaller size particles are advantageous in certain situations concerns the shortened diffusional path and often higher rates of reaction. Furthermore, in catalytic applications where a molecule diffuses into the crystallite and cracks, if there remains an extremely long diffusion path for the cracked products to exit, those products may further crack to form smaller, undesired products before they leave the crystallite. Our method produces a ZSM 5 zeolite having a SiO2 to A1203 0, mole ratio R greater than 5, having crystallites with their smallest dimension below about 0.3 micrometer, and having an average unit cell represented by the formulaEMI11.1 Formula 2 where R 2 96 x x M represents monovalent cations such as alkali metals, organic bases, or H EMI11.2 represents the intersections of the channels inside the ZSM 5 porous framework free of tetrapropyl ammonium ions, andEMI11.3 represents the intersections of the channels inside the ZSM 5 porous framework having occluded tetrapropyl ammonium ions. The method uses a mixture containing a source of silica, a source of alumina, a source of alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, water, a polyol such as ethylene glycol, and a small amount of tetrapropyl ammonium ions.The amount of tetrapropyl ammonium ions in the reaction mixture is such that it is at least an effective amount and in an amount expressed in moles which is less than 1 120 of the sum of the number of moles of Si in the reaction slurry multiplied by 0.8 and the number of moles of Al in the reaction slurry. After the mixture is reacted in a heated reactor such as an autoclave, theZSM 5 zeolite product is recovered. When the source of alumina is omitted, then silicalite is formed. The ZSM 5 zeolite obtained as synthesized has a small amount of Q ions in the intersections. In Formula 2 above the maximum value of y is 0.8 which corresponds to 20 of the theoretical stoichiometric amount. A more preferred value has y less than 0.6 and more preferably y is less than 0.4. At these concentrations, essentially all of the Q in the reaction mixture is deposited in the zeolite produced. In contrast to the small amounts of Q used in the present process all of the examples of the basic Argauer et al patent utilize more than 870 of the stoichiometric amount of Q which is about 44 times the upper limit of our process. With regard to our preferred upper limit of y 0.4, Argauer et al use more than 88 times that amount in each of their six synthesis examples Nos. 1 6 . The process according to the present invention produces ZSM 5 having a high degree of crystallinity, an occluded carbon content as prepared and water washed of less than 0.1 mole of carbon per mole of total silicon and aluminum contained in the ZSM 5, a zeolitic alkali metal content as prepared and water washed of less than one mole per mole of contained aluminum, a high degree of crystalline purity exhibiting a single crystalline phase material, an aluminosilicate or silicalite structure, the capacity to be readily exchangeable without prior removal of Q ions, and containing as prepared and water washed less than 1 120 mole of nitrogen per mole of total silicon and aluminum contained in the ZSM 5. The ZSM 5 zeolite obtained after being water washed will normally have Na as M in Formula 2 . This product can be further ammonium ion exchanged so that M becomes NH4. It is also possible to at least partially exchange the as washed product with an equivalent amount of lanthanide ion. By lanthanide ion we mean the cations of all those elements having an atomic number of 57 71 inclusive plus the element yttrium. In one embodiment we add a small amount of QBr solid crystals to water to assure complete dissolution of the crystals and then the dissolved QBr is mixed with the other materials to form the desired small size ZSM 5 zeolites or silicalite. In another embodiment we utilize a special seeding material to initiate nucleation. The seeding material for the seeding material embodiment is made from a dilute system containing silica, alumina, soda, water and trace amounts of QBr. For example, a mole ratio of 1000 SiO2 1 Awl203 45 Na2O 30,000 H2O 30 QBr can be typically used . In this seeding material the silica to alumina mole ratio can be very high. The material may be heated for a few hours at a high temperature such as 80 1000C prior to use, although the heating step is not critical. The exact nature of the seeding material is not known. For example, if the seeding material is dried into a powder, x ray difractometry fails to detect any crystallinity.However, it is believed that the fundamental ZSM 5 framework units begin to form in the seeding material or possibly that extremely small crystalline domains are formed, but cannot be detected because of their size. In summary, the reaction mixture contains no source of ZSM 5 crystallites which are discernible by powder x ray diffraction. The small relative amounts of Q ions present in the seeding material are believed to initiate nucleation of seeding in the reaction system. The desired mole ratio of silica to alumina in theZSM 5 product is controlled by the amount of silica and alumina added to the reaction mixture. If the silica to alumina ratio is greater than 6, then a product is obtained having a silica to alumina ratio greater than 5.In the absence of alumina the product silicalite is obtained. Preferred silica to alumina ratios in the reaction mixture are 20 120 with a more preferred range being 40 80. A reaction mixture can be prepared by adding a measured amount of seeding material to the other reactants such as silica, alumina, soda, a polyol such as ethylene glycol and water. The reactant mixture can then be transferred to a stirred autoclave where the major reaction takes place. Under the controlled hydrothermal conditions in the stirred reactor autoclave the crystallization reaction takes place in which the ethylene glycol appears to function in part as a template. The size of the ZSM 5 product is generally controlled by the amount of seeding material used. By using a measured amount of seeding material to provide the ZSM 5 nuclei and by using a substantial amount of ethylene glycol, it is possible to synthesize any size crystallite of ZSM 5 below about 10 micrometers preferably below 1 micrometer and most preferably below 0.3 micrometer. The equivalent product concentrations are greater than 12 and preferably greater than 14 and the product throughputs are tyupically greater than 400Kg m day and more preferably greater than 500 3Kg m day. Since ethylene glycol can be readily washed out of theZSM 5 product, the major portion of the channels and intersections within each crystallite are free of any blocking organic substances after washing. Although the central part of each crystallite or scattered small clusters may contain some blocking Q ions, the proportion is so small compared to the total number of intersections that it does not impair the subsequent ion exchange step.As a result, our process eliminates the required calcination step prior to the ion exchanging as described in many previous ZSM 5 synthesis procedures. The size of the ZSM 5 crystallite is further controlled by selecting the proper combination of soda and water concentrations. The concentration of reactive soda at any time is indirectly measured by the pH. Adding too much soda will cause large particles to be formed. For example, in a 60 SiO2 to 1 A1203 system having greater than 10 moles of Na2O per mole of A1203 will result in large size crystallites. If the solids content is increased by reducing the amount of water, large crystallites will also be produced. For example, in a 60SiO2 to 1 A1203 system, when the amount of water is reduced from 800 moles water for each mole of A1203 to 600 moles of water, the crystallite size increases. The synthesis temperature also has an effect on the size of the ZSM 5 crystallites. The synthesis time varies inversely with temperatures in the range from about 1000 to 2000C with the optimal temperature for making small crystallites being about 1700 1800c. If the reaction temperature is significantly increased above 2000C, for example, the size of the crystallites will increase. A further problem with high temperatures above 2000C is that some of the organic components will begin to decompose and possibly char. Thus the preferred temperature to conduct the crystallization is less than 2000C. The reaction slurries used in the present process have the following molar ratios of ingredients Particularly Broad Preferred PreferredSiO2 to A1203 greater than 20 120 40 80 6 H20 to OH 20 120 30 100 50 70Polyol to SiO2 A1203 less than less than less than 1.0 0.50 0.20 Si Al to H2O 0.03 0.15 0.05 0.12 0.06 0.09Q to U less than less than less than 0.8 0.6 0.4Reaction Temp.

The term U is 1 96 of the sum of the number of moles of Si in the reacting mixture multiplied by 0.8 plus the number of moles of Al in the resulting mixture.In the synthesis essentially all of the Q charged to the reaction slurry becomes occluded in the reaction product. The upper amount of polyol given above is not critical. For example in a 60SiO2 to 1 A1203 system the upper amount of polyol would be 61 moles. This is clearly enough. Although the amount could be exceeded, there is no economic or process advantage to do so when making small size crystallites. ZSM 5 zeolites can be produced from reactant slurries where the mole ratio of SiO2 to A1203 can vary from about 5 up to any higher value. We have obtained good results where the ratio ranges from between 20 to 120 with a more preferred ratio range being about 40 to 80. In general, essentially all of the alumina used in the reaction mixture ends up in the product zeolite. This is not the case with the silica. Because of the high alkalinity of the reaction system some of the silica remains in solution in the mother liquor. The specific proportion varies depending on the specific mixtures and conditions used. In the SiO2 to A1203 ratio ranges of about 20 to about 120, approximately 80 15 of the silica enters the product zeolite. Our preferred method to prepare the reaction slurry is to first dilute the silica source such as Ludox with about one third of the required de ionized water. The seeding material or QBr and the ethylene glycol are mixed with another one third of the de ionized water and this mixture is poured into the dilute silica product.Finally, the sodium hydroxide and sodium aluminate are mixed with the remainder of the de ionized water and this mixture is then added with stir ring to the previous two components. The resulting slurry is mixed and transferred to a stirred autoclave for synthesis. The ZSM 5 can also be produced using a recycle of the mother liquor to avoid waste of valuable SiO2, Na2O and ethylene glycol. As mentioned earlier, although essentially all of the Q ion and all of the alumina charged to the reaction mixture end up in the product, the silica only reacts partially and the soda and ethylene glycol remain in excess. A good portion of this mother liquor containing silica, soda and ethylene glycol can readily be separated from the product and recovered by filtration. When using the mother liquor to make a new synthesis slurry a full complement of alumina and QBr are added but only a fraction of the original amounts of silica, sodium hydroxide and ethylene glycol need be added. As such the composition of the made up recycle slurry is the same as the composition of the initial slurry.If a different starting slurry composition is desired, this can also be achieved using the recycled mother liquor. The recycle scheme may be repeated numerous times without detriment to the properties and quality including crystallite size of the resulting product. As shown in Example 9 numerous recycle runs can be used with by product mother liquor to produce ZSM 5 of high quality and of very small crystallite size using ethylene glycol and only trace amounts of QBr. The characterization of the ZSM 5 product for crystalline purity and degree of crystallinity was carried out using standard x ray diffraction methods by using aNorelco X Ray Diffractometer manufactured by PhilipSElectronics, Inc. Model 12045B 3 . A powder x ray diffraction pattern was obtained under standardized conditions which include the packing of the zeolite product and the settings of the instrument controls. The pattern was examined qualitatively and quantitatively. The qualitative examination included establishing the presence of all the characteristic diffraction lines of ZSM 5 as defined by Argauer et al inU.S. Patent No. 3,702,886. ZSM 5 was considered the product made when all of the key diffraction lines were found in our product and no extraneous lines were observed. The absence of foreign x ray diffraction lines was considered indicative of crystalline purity. The quantitative characterization of our product was made by comparing the peak height of the strongest diffraction line which occurs at a d spacing of 3.85 0.07 Angstrom units with the corresponding peak height of a reference ZSM 5 material prepared by the Argauer et al patent. The ratio of the peak height of our material to the peak height of the reference material times 100 was taken as the crystallinity of our material. Within the experimental error of this method, the reference material had as large a peak height as any ZSM 5 material examined over several years of research. Therefore, that material was assigned 100 crystallinity. Although the method used is convenient and provides a quick and practical determination of the degree of crystallinity, it is not exact and may have an error of up to 20 of the value determined depending on several factors.For example, very small crystallites tend to give somewhat wide diffraction peaks which often results in smaller peak heights. There is no need for large amounts of the tetrapropyl ammonium ion template when using ethylene glycol according to the present invention. In fact, large relative amounts of Q are undesirable because these large cations end up within the structure and block diffusion through the pores. The resulting zeolite product would then require calcination before the sodium form of the zeolite could be ion exchanged to the ammonium and eventually the hydrogen form for catalytic applications. However, the addition of a small amount of Q ions is necessary in our systems since without any 0 ions the crystallites obtained can be very large. The upper limit for the amount of Q ions in the reaction slurry or mix can be specified in terms of the number of moles of Si and the number of moles of Al in the reaction slurry. We define U as 1 96 of the sum of the number of moles of Si in the reaction mixture multiplied by 0.8 plus the number of moles of Al in the reaction mixture. On this basis the number of moles of tetrapropyl ammonium halide or hydroxide used in a reaction slurry to provide the Q ions is less than 0.8U for the broad range, less than 0.6U for the preferred range, and less than 0.4U for the most preferred range. A further advantage of the present process is its very high reaction throughput which is possible because of the high equivalent product concentration in the reaction slurry coupled with the relatively short reaction time.The ZSM 5 zeolites readily form in the autoclave at temperatures of about 1750C in less than 8 hours. The equivalent product concentration in the reaction slurry may be calculated after the reaction is completed and is expressed as the weight percent of ZSM 5 in the sodium form on a dry basis obtained from a reaction slurry. It is equal to 100 times the summation of the weight of SiO2, A1203, and equivalent Na2O in the zeolite product divided by the weight of the initial reaction slurry. The reactor autoclave throughput is the weight of product prepared per unit of reactor autoclave volume per unit time. It is a very important parameter since it measures the productivity rate through the most capital intensive unit operation in the process, namely, the autoclaving step. The reactor autoclave throughput, or simply the throughput, may be expressed in various units.We shall use the following units and specific definition to describe our process Throughput is the weight in Kilograms of the ZSM 5 product obtained, expressed on a dry basis and normalized to the pure sodium form, per cubic meter of reactor autoclave volume per day. For example, the throughput in an autoclaving step in which 360 grams of equivalent dry basis sodium ZSM 5 is obtained in an autoclaving step lasting 6 hours in an 3 autoclave volume of 2400 cm will be 6 3 360g x 10 3Kg g x 106 cm m x 24 hours day 600 Kg m day 2400 cm x 6 hours The scanning electron microscope is used to secure scanning electron micrographs SEM of the ZSM 5 zeolite product with magnifications in the range of from about 1,000 to about 100,000. Submicron crystallites of ZSM 5 products are clearly photographed and measured by SEM in 10,000 times magnification and greater. The sources for the major reactants used in our synthesis of ZSM 5 zeolites are given below. The source of silica used in the synthesis can be silica gel or silica hydrogel manufactured by DavisonChemical Co., a division of W. R. Grace Cho. another type of silica gel is Hi Sil manufactured by PittsburghPlate Glass Ludox, a colloidal silica sol manufactured by Dupontt fumed silica such as Cabosil manufactured by CabotCorp., another type of fume silica is the by product of the ferro silicon industry which is widely available in industry sodium silicate which is known as waterglass and is readily available commercially it may also be a source of soda and any other form of reactive silica. Sodium hydroxide is a source of soda and it is also a commodity chemical which is commercially available. Sodium silicate or water glass is often used as a source of soda and silica. The source of alumina can be sodium aluminate, aluminum sulfate, or any other form of reactive alumina. The polyols which may be used either alone or in combination include ethylene glycol, propanediols, butanediols, hexanediols, diethylene glycol, triethyleneglycol, polyethylene glycols, glycerol, and polysaccharides. Ethylene glycol is a commodity chemical available from many sources and it is made by Baker and other companies. The source of tetrapropylammonium cations can be tetrapropylammonium halides such as the bromide or tetrapropylammonium hydroxide which are available fromEastman Kodak Co. and other companies or in the case of the halide which may be the resulting product of the reaction of a propyl halide and tripropylamine. The ZSM 5 made by the present process can be directly used to make a catalyst. The reaction slurry made according to the present invention is heated at a temperature of from about 150 2000C for less than 24 hours to produce a ZSM 5 zeolite and a mother liquor. The reaction materials are cooled and filtered to obtain the zeolite reaction product. The filtered zeolite is washed and cation exchanged. The exchange may be made with NH4 , H , lanthanide or other desired cations as well as with mixtures of these. The exchanged zeolite is blended with a matrix material and formed into a particle. The formed particle is dried and calcined to yield a ZSM 5 zeolite containing catalyst. Having described the basic aspects of our invention, the following examples are given to illustrate specific embodiments thereof. Example 1 This example illustrates the synthesis of zeoliteZSM 5 using ethylene glycol and a small amount of tetrapropyl ammonium ion Q using a seeding material according to the present invention. A seeding material pool was prepared containing 3.20 g sodium aluminate 20 Al203, 17 Na2O , 948.3 gLudox HS 40 containing 39.8 SiO2, 43.6 g of 50 NaOH solution, 50.2 g tetrapropyl ammonium bromide QBr , and 2791.6 g deionized water. This mixture was heated for 6 hours at 800C., after which it was cooled and stored for future use. This system was denoted Seed Material and exhibited a composition expressed in moles of about 1000 SiO2 A12 3 45 Na,O 30,000 H2 0 30 QBr. Next, a reaction mixture was prepared by weighing out the following ingredients 150 g of Seed Material, 24.0 g sodium aluminate, 388.1 g Ludox HS 40, 32.8 g 50 NaOH solution, 29.1 g ethylene glycol EG and 299.7 g deionized water. About one third of the de ionized water was added to the Ludox. Then the ethylene glycol and the 150 g of Seed Material were mixed together with another one third of the de ionized water. This mixture was then added to the diluted Ludox. Finally, the sodium hydroxide and the sodium aluminate were mixed with the remaining de ionized water and then added into the Ludox mixture.The resulting system contained the following weights of ingredients Ingredient Weight g SiO2 169.2 A12O3 4.825 Na2O 17.47 QBr 1.962 E.G. 29.10 H2O 701.01 TOTAL 923.6The density of the mix was about 1.16 g cm and its 3 volume was about 796 cm . The composition expressed in moles relative to Awl203 was 59.6 SiO2 Al2O3 5.96 Na2O 823 H2O 9.92 EG 0.156 QBr.The resulting slurry was mixed by hand stir ring and then immediately heated in a stirred autoclave until it reached about 1750C which took under 0.5 hour. The temperature was then maintained for 7.5 hours at about 1750C . The resultant product was cooled to room temperature, removed, filtered, washed using 1 liter of warm deionized water and dried overnight at 1200C. The product weighed 147 g. The equivalent product concentration was calculated to be 15.9 weight percent. A portion of this product was subjected to powder x ray diffraction analysis and identified as pure ZSM 5 with a degree of crystallinity of 1008. The sample prepared was considered to be essentially pure ZSM 5 in the sodium form although it contained a trace of Q ions. From these data, the autoclave throughput was calculated to be about 554 Kg m day. Chemical analysis of the product gave 91.50 SiO2, 3.30 A1203 2.40 Na2O and 0.93 C. The composition of the as prepared and water washed product, expressed in moles was about 47.1 SiO2 A1203 1.20 Na2O 2.40 C.The concentration of A1203 3.30 coupled with the weight of sample prepared 147 g was used to calculate the weight of alumina in the zeolite 4.851 g which, within normal experimental analytical errors, corresponded to the weight of Awl 203 in the sodium aluminate used in the preparation 4.825 g . In other words, the Al203 reacted quantitatively. In the case of SiO2, however, only about 134.5 g ended up in the zeolite. This amount represented about 80 of the starting weight of SiO2 used 169.2 g . About 34.7 g remained in solution in the mother liquor together with much of the Na2O employed. The mother liquor contained about 13.94 g of the 17.47 g of Na2O charged to the reactor. The mother liquor also contained most of the bromide ion from the QBr as well as ethylene glycol and, of course, water, but did not contain Q ions. The product was then ion exchanged with 2 NH4NO3 aqueous solution, followed by a warm water rinse and dried at 1200C. Upon analysis, the resulting chemical composition was found to be Weight Ingredient on a dry basis SiO2 94.14 2 3 3.49 Na2O 0.036 C 0.72 Br 0.0194The analysis of carbon showed that the amount of carbon contained in the exchanged zeolite corresponded within normal experimental analytical errors to the carbon in the amount of QBr employed to prepare the sample. In other words all of the Q ion charged to the autoclave ended up occluded within the ZSM 5 zeolite structure. The analytical data of the as prepared zeolite and of the ammonium exchanged sample, coupled with the starting weights and the weight of zeolite obtained, were used to compute the composition of the average unit cell of the two zeolites as per Formula 2 . For the as prepared and water washed sample, we obtained EMI26.1 Formula 5 The sodium and carbon analyses indicated that this sample included, besides the composition shown, some freeNaOH and ethylene glycol within its structure probably due to insufficient water washing . The occluded Q ions blocked only 0.31 out of four intersections or about 7.8 of all the intersections within the structure. The balance, or approximately 92 of the intersections, remained open to diffusion and flow. The open nature of the porous network was the fundamental reason why the sample could be ion exchanged without prior calcination to remove excessive levels of blocking Q ions. For the ammonium exchanged sample, the symbolic representation of the average unit cell was EMI26.2 Formula 6 which showed that the zeolite existed essentially in the pure NH4 form. Less than 1 of the acid sites were in the Na form. The silicon to aluminum ratio was, within normal experimental errors, the same as the parent zeolite. The number of occluded Q ions 0.29 was also essentially the value 0.31 obtained for the parent sample. A portion of the ammonium form of the product weighing about 5 g was placed in a crucible and calcined in air to convert it to the catalytically active H form.Calcination was carried out at 10000F for 3 hours. A weight loss of about 4 was measured, which was attributed to the decomposition of the NH 4 ions to NH3 gas and the the oxidation and decomposition of the Q ions to CO2, H2O and N2 and the evaporation of the water still present in the sample. The final product is essentially represented by EMI27.1 Formula 7 Photographs of the product taken by Scanning ElectronMicroscopy SEM showed aggregates of crystallites ranging in size from about 0.1 to 0.3 micrometer. This example shows that the process according to the present invention produces a ZSM 5 zeolite having a very high degree of crystallinity and excellent crystalline purity. The very small crystallites are produced using only traces of QBr which allows for easy exchange of the sodium without the need of any precalcination. The cost of the reactants used is low, the throughput of material in the process is very high, the process does not generate noxious wastes and is therefore a superior, practical and economical industrial process to manufacture ZSM 5. Example 2 This example illustrates the synthesis of zeoliteZSM 5 using ethylene glycol and a small amount of Q according to the present invention. A reaction mixture was prepared by weighing out the following ingredients 1.95 g tetrapropyl ammonium bromide QBr crystals, 24.0 g sodium aluminate solution 20 A1203 and 17 Na2O , 425.8 g Ludox HS 40 39.8 SiO2 , 34.6 g 50 NaOH solution, 23.3 g ethylene glycol EG and 385.2 g deionized water. About one third of the deionized water was added to the Ludox. The 1.95 g QBr was dissolved in another one third of the deionized water and then mixed with the ethylene glycol. This mixture was then added to the diluted Ludox. Finally, the sodium hydroxide and the sodium aluminate were mixed with the remaining deionized water and then added into the previous mixture. The resulting slurry weighed about 895 g, exhibited a density of about 1.16 g cm and a volume of 3 about 772 cm .It had a composition expressed in moles of about 60 SiO2 A1203 6 Na2O 800 H2O 8 EG 0.155 QBr.The resulting slurry was mixed by hand stirring and then immediately heated in a stirred autoclave until it reached about 1750C which took under 0.5 hour. The temperature was then maintained for 7.5 hours at about 1750C. The resultant product was cooled to room temperature, removed, filtered, washed using 1 liter of warm deionized water and dried overnight at 1200C. The product weighed 126 g. The equivalent product concentration was calculated to be 14.1 and the autoclave throughput about 490 Kg m3 day. A portion of this product was subjected to powder x ray diffraction analysis and found to be pure ZSM 5 crystals with a degree of crystallinity of about 100 .The sample was examined by SEM and found to consist of small aggregates of crystallites of about 0.1 0.3 micrometer size. Chemical analysis showed 91.0 SiO2, 3.81 Al203, 2.90 Na2O and 0.88 C. The composition of the product expressed in terms of one unit cell was calculated to be EMI29.1 Formula 8 Example 3 The product obtained in Example 2 is directly ion exchanged with 2 NH4NO3 solution, followed by a warm water wash and dried at 1200C. Upon analysis, the resulting chemical composition expressed in terms of one unit cell is calculated to be essentially EMI29.2 Formula 9 which corresponds to an open porous structure essentially in the ammonium form. The product is calcined at 10000F in air for a period of 3 hours and it looses ammonia and the Q ions are burnt off to yield a final product for catalyst use represented by EMI29.3 Formula 10 The following Examples 4 6 show other ZSM 5 products made with varying silica to alumina ratios. Example 4 A reaction slurry was prepared using the general method of Example 2, but with a reaction slurry composition expressed in relative moles of about 30 SiO2 A1203 3 Na2O 400 H2O 4 EG 0.077 QBr.The amount of alumina was essentially doubled. Powder x ray diffraction analysis of the final product showed pure ZSM 5 zeolite. Example 5 A reaction slurry was prepared using the general method of Example 2, but with a reaction slurry composition expressed in relative moles of about 20 SiO2 A1203 2 Na2O 267 H2O 2.67 EG 0.052 QBr The amount of alumina was about tripled. Again, powder x ray diffraction analysis of the final product showed pure ZSM 5 zeolite. Example 6 A reaction slurry was prepared using the general method of Example 1, but with a reaction slurry composition expressed in relative moles of about 120 SiO2 1 A1203 16 Na2O 1600 H2O 16 EG 0.31 QBrPowder x ray diffraction of the final product showed pureZSM 5 zeolite. Example 7 This example illustrates the importance of small amount of QBr in making small crystallite size ZSM 5 zeolite. A reaction slurry was prepared following the general method described in Example 2, but with a reaction slurry composition expressed in relative moles of about 60 SiO2 At20, 4.5 Na2O 800 H2O 10 EG 0.155 QBrPowder x ray diffraction of the final product showed pureZSM 5 zeolite of excellent degree of crystallinity.Examination of the product by Scanning Electron Microscopy showed it to consist of aggregates of small crystallites of about 0.3 micrometer size. In contrast a sample prepared identically, except that the QBr ingredient was deliberately deleted from the reaction slurry, revealed by SEM examination large sizeZSM 5 crystallites, namely, about 3.0 micrometers. In every other key respect the two samples were essentially the same. Example 8 This example illustrates the effect of the addition ofZSM 5 seeds in the preparation of the ZSM 5 Zeolite using ethylene glycol. A reaction slurry was prepared using the general method described in Example 2 except that in place of theQBr solution, ZSM 5 seeds were used to form a reaction slurry composition expressed in relative moles of about 60 SiO2 A1203 8 Na2O 800 H2O 8 EGNote that the slurry contained no QBr, instead 1.5 g ofZSM 5 seeds were used. The ZSM 5 seeds had been obtained from a previous run using our standard method and exhibited a crystallite size of approximately 0.2 micrometer. Care was taken to ensure that the seeds were adequately dispersed in the slurry. The slurry was charged to an autoclave which was sealed and heated under agitation over a period of about 1 2 hour to a temperature of 1750C, which temperature was held for a period of about 7 1 2 hours.At the end of the 8 hour heating cycle, the charge was allowed to cool to room temperature, taken out of the autoclave, filtered, washed with warm water, and finally dried. Powder x ray diffraction analysis showed the material to be pure ZSM 5 with an excellent degree of crystallinity. Examination of the product by scanning electron microscopy showed well defined polyhedral crystallites with dimensions of about 1 3 micrometers.This example shows that the use of ZSM 5 crystal seeds instead of QBr results in large crystallites. Example 9 This example illustrates the capability of our method to recycle mother liquor in the synthesis of ZSM 5 in order to avoid waste of valuable SiO2, Na2O and ethylene glycol. As indicated in Example 1, all of the Q ion and all of the alumina charged to the reaction mixture end up in the product. This is not the case for the silica which only reacts to about 80 of the level used in the reaction mixture, nor the soda or ethylene glycol. These substances, together with water, constitute the mother liquor which comes out of the autoclave step mixed with the ZSM 5 product. A good portion of this mother liquor can readily be separated from the product by filtration. The general method used for recycling all or part of the mother liquor is to form a synthesis slurry of the original run composition using smaller amounts of soda, ethylene glycol and silica since these materials can be supplemented from the mother liquor and a full complement of alumina and QBr but only a fraction of the silica, sodium hydroxide and ethylene glycol. The recycle scheme may be repeated numerous times without detriment to the properties and quality including crystallite size of the resulting product. The specific details which follow apply to an original run prepared as per the procedure of Example 1 and five consecutive runs in which mother liquor was recycled. After five consecutive successful recycle runs, 516 g of the mother liquor resulting from the fifth recycle run with a pH of 11.4 and a silica content of 4.06 was obtained. A sixth recycle run slurry was prepared by mixing 200 g of the mother liquor with 303 g of HS 40 Ludox. A solution containing 150 g of seed material as described in Example 1, 6 g of ethylene glycol and 100 g of mother liquor was added to the Ludox mix. The 7 g of NaOH 50 and 24 g of sodium aluminate 20 A1203 and 17 Na2O was mixed and diluted in another 100 g of mother liquor.The second solution was slowly added to the Ludox mix with vigorous stirring to give the final reaction slurry which exhibited a pH of 12.9. The mole ratio of silica to alumina of the slurry was about 54 1. The reaction slurry was processed as per the procedure of Example 1. The weight of ZSM 5 product obtained was 124 g, the powder x ray diffraction analysis showed pure ZSM 5 of excellent degree of crystallinity and the scanning electron microscope revealed the crystallite size to be about 0.20 micrometer. The chemical analysis of the final product was 2.25 Na2O, 0.79 carbon, 3.72 Al203 and 93.9 SiO2. The silica to alumina ratio of the final zeolite was 42.9 to 1. This example demonstrates the feasibility of numerous recycle runs using by product mother liquor to produceZSM 5 of high quality and of very small crystallite size using ethylene glycol and only trace amounts of QBr. Other prior art processes to make ZSM 5 have been discussed earlier. The Taramasso et al process which used polyols, but without any Q ions, discloses 8 days of autoclaving to complete their ZSM 5 synthesis. Their equivalent product concentration is calculated to be less than 3 as compared to values of greater than 12 obtained by the present process. The reactor throughput is 3 calculated to be less than about 4 Kg m day compared to 2 values of greater than 480 Kg m day obtained in Examples 1 and 2. The following Comparison Reference Examples 1 and 2 replicate prior art processes using ethanol alone in place of Q ions and n propylamine in place of 9 ions. In both cases larger size crystallites are obtained. Comparison Reference Example 1 Plank et al in U.S. Patent No. 4,175,114 assigned toMobil disclose in Example 1 using ethanol to produce aZSM 5 product substantially deficient in an organic ammonium cation. This product can be exchanged directly without any calcination. Example No. 1 was carefully replicated in our laboratories using the same reagents and following the procedures described by Plank et al. except regarding the time of autoclaving. Instead of using the autoclaving time of 24 hours given in the example, the progress of the reaction was followed by x ray diffraction analysis and the reaction was stopped when the degree of crystallinity was complete. Our replicate required only 17 hours to reach full crystallinity and that is the value reported and the value used to calculate other parameters.Consequently, the values listed in our replicate are either equal to those reported by Plank et al or actually improvements over their teachings. Table 1 sets forth the data given by Plank et al. and the corresponding data obtained in our replicate, as well as significant parameters calculated from the data given.Note the very large size of the ZSM 5 crystals produced by the process of Example 1 of Plank et al.

The Plank et al process makes crystallites which are much larger than according to the present process. It uses a low equivalent product concentration about 5.1 vs. about 14 to 16 for ours and has a low autoclave throughput of about 54 to 78 Kg m day vs. our throughput of greater than 480 Kg m3 day. It employs somewhat costly raw materials. All of which combines to make a poor product by an expensive, impractical process. Comparison Reference Example 2 Rubin et al in U.S. Patent 4,151,189 assigned to Mobil disclose the use of propyl amines such as normal and isopropyl a mines as a means to prepare zeolites essentially free of sodium, thus eliminating the precalcination and cation exchange steps.

Instead of using the autoclaving time of 45 hours given in the example, the progress of the reaction was followed by x ray diffraction analysis and the reaction was stopped when the degree of crystallinity was complete. Our replicate required only 8 hours to reach full crystallinity and that is the value reported and the value used to calculate other parameters. Consequently, the values listed in our replicate are either equal to those reported by Rubin et al or actually improvements over their teachings.

It is understood that the foregoing detailed description is given merely by way of illustration and that many variations may be made therein without departing from the spirit of this invention.
