# Desulfurization catalyst.

## Abstract
Desulfurization and hydrocarbon conversion catalysts contain at least one Group VIB metal component, at least one Group VIII metal component, and a phosphorus com ponent on a porous refractory oxide and have a narrow pore size distribution including at least about 75 percent of the total pore volume in pores of diameter from about 70 to about 130 angstroms and have less than about 10 percent of the total pore volume in pores of diameter greater than about 130 angstroms. The catalyst is useful for promoting a number of hydrocarbon conversion reactions, particularly those involving hydrogenative desulfurization.
