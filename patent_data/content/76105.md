# Method of producing a bipolar transistor.

## Abstract
A method of producing a bipolar transistor comprises the steps of forming a base region 41 , forming a high melting point metal layer 42 of a base electrode on the base region 41 , forming a first insulating layer 43 on the metal layer 42 , and selectively etching the first insulating layer 43 and the metal layer 42 to form an opening 45 . A second insulating layer 46 is formed on the sides of the first insulating layer 43 and the metal layer 42 within the opening 45 , the second insulating layer 46 defining an emitter providing region. Impurities are introduced into the base region 41 by using the second insulating layer 43 as a mask to form an emitter region 49 . An emitter electrode 51 and the base electrode 42 are arranged in a like multilayer structure.
