## Description
The present invention relates to a novel method for controlling weeds, preferably selectively in crops of useful plants. Further, the invention also relates to novel compounds used in said new method to processes for preparing these compounds and to compositions containing them as active ingredients. According to the method of the present invention weeds can be controlled by applying thereto or to the locus thereof of a herbicidally effective amount of a 5 imidazolecarboxylic acid derivative of formula or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof, or of a salt thereof, Some of the active ingredients of formula I , methods of preparing them and their pharmaceutical use as antifungal agents are known from US A 3,485,917. Further, some of these compounds were described as active agents in a method for inhibiting bud growth in US A 3,873,297. The majority of compounds of formula I are novel and have especially been developped to be used in the method of this invention. Surprisingly, the compounds of formula I exhibit strong herbicidal properties, and are therefore useful to control weeds. This property gains importance by the fact that some crops of useful plants are not damaged, or are only slightly harmed at high dosages, when treated with compounds of formula I . Consequently, the compounds of formula I are valuable selective herbicides in crops of useful plants, such as rice and maize. Especially in rice crops a broad range of application rates can be employed, preferably if the rice crops are transplanted rice crops, and if the compounds of formula I are applied after transplantation. In maize crops selective herbicidal action is observed both at preemergence and at postemergence treatment. The active ingredients of formula I are usually applied at application rates of 0.01 to 5.0 kg of active ingredient per hectare in order to achieve satisfying results. Sometimes, depending on the evironmental conditions, the application rates may exceed the above designated limitations. However, the preferred application rates are between 0.02 kg and 1.0 kg a.i. per hectare. As used in the foregoing definitions C₁ C₅alkyl denotes straight or branch chained saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, the four butyl isomers, the pentyl isomers C₁ C₇alkyl includes C₁ C₅alkyl radicals and the higher homologs thereof having 6 or 7 carbon atoms It is evident that the substituents on the radical X may be attached to different carbon atoms, or two of them may also take geminal positions. Depending on the nature of the moiety X and or the group R² the compounds of formula I contain asymmetrical carbon atoms. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixtures of all stereochemically isomeric forms. These mixtures contain all diastereomeres and enantiomeres of the basic molecular structure. Pure isomeric forms of these compounds can be separated from the mixtures by conventional separation methods. Preferably, if a specific stereochemical form is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereoselective methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ optically active starting materials. The invention also comprises the use of the salts which the compounds of formula I are able to form with organic or inorganic bases such as amines, alkali metal bases and earth alkaline metal bases, or quaternary ammonium bases, or with organic or inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids or phosphorus containing acids. Examples for salt forming mineral acids are hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, chloric acid, perchloric acid or phosphoric acid. Prefered salt forming sulfonic acids are toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Preferred salt forming carboxylic acids are acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, chloroacetic acid, phthalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid and citric acid. Phosphorous containing acids are the various phosphonous acids, phosphonic acids and phosphinic acids. Preferred salt forming alkali metal hydroxides and earth alkaline metal hydroxides are the hydroxides of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium, most preferably those of sodium or potassium. Examples of suitable salt forming amines are primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di n butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline. Preferred amines are ethylamine, propylamine, diethylamine or triethylamine, with isopropylamine, diethanolamine and 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane being most preferred. Examples of quaternary ammonium bases are, in general, the cations of haloammonium salts, e.g. the tetramethylammonium cation, the trimethylbenzylammonium cation, the triethylbenzylammonium cation, the tetraethylammonium cation, the trimethylethylammonium cation, and also the ammonium cation. A preferred subgroup of active ingredients used in the method of this invention are those compounds of formula I , wherein Within this preferred group, those compounds are particularly preferred, wherein X is a radical of formula wherein Within this group of particularly preferred compounds special preference is put to compounds wherein either From subgroup e those compounds are preferred wherein R² is methyl. A more particularly preferred subgroup comprises those compounds wherein n is two, R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are each independently hydrogen or methyl, R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ are each independently hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro or bromo, and R² is C₁ C₄alkyl. Among this group again those compounds are preferred, wherein R² is methyl. The same preference is given to compounds wherein n is one, R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are each independently hydrogen or methyl, R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ are each independently hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro or bromo, and R² is C₁ C₄alkyl. The most preferred compounds which can be used in the method according to this invention are selected among As mentioned above most of the active ingredients of formula I are novel compounds and have especially been developped to be used as active substances in the novel method for controlling weeds according to the present invention. These compounds therefore constitute a further aspect of the invention. The said novel compounds can be represented by the formula wherein, R¹, R² and X have the previously defined meaning, provided that X is other than unsubstituted 1 indanyl, or unsubstituted 1 tetrahydronaphthalenyl. Preferred novel compounds are those wherein X is a radical of formula a as defined hereinabove, wherein n is one, R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are each independently hydrogen or methyl, R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ are each independently hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, fluoro, chloro or bromo, and R² is C₁ C₄alkyl. The most preferred novel compounds are The preparation of the compounds of formula I , both the novel ones and the known ones, is generally carried out by the following methods. The compounds of formula I can be obtained by condensing a compound of formula wherein R² and X are as defined hereinabove, with a C₁ C₄alkyl ester of formic acid in the presence of suitable base such as, for example, an alkali metal alkoxide or hydride, e.g. sodium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium hydride, lithium hydride, and the like, in a reaction inert solvent and treating the resultant intermediate of formula wherein R² and X are as defined hereinabove and Z is an alkali metal atom, In the afore mentioned processes reaction inert solvents are, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene or xylene ethers such as, for example, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or other aprotic organic solvents. For the cyclization reaction of the imidazole ring structure, strong mineral acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid, are most conveniently employed. In the ring forming variant c also other acids, e.g. acetic acid, can be used. In this reaction an excess of acid of 5 to 50, preferably of 15 to 40 times the required molar amount is most preferably used. The excess of ammonium salt in this process is 2 to 50, preferably 10 to 30 times the required molar amount. The substituent R² on the carboxylic acid group may be transformed to other substituents encompassed by the definition of R² by convenient reactions known in the art for the modification of carboxylic acid functions, e.g. by hydrolysis and esterification and or transesterification. If the synthesis of sterochemically pure isomers is intended, stereoselective reaction steps and conditions are recommended. On the other hand conventional methods of separation can be used for obtaining pure isomers from a mixture of stereochemical isomers. The starting materials for the preparation of the novel compounds of formula I are known, or they can be obtained by known synthesis procedures. For examples, the compounds of formula II can be obtained by reacting a glycine ester of formula The compounds of formula I are stable compounds and no precautionary measures are required for handling them. When used at the indicated rates of application, the compounds of formula I have good selective herbicidal properties which make them most suitable for use in crops of useful plants, preferably in maize and in rice. In some cases damage is also caused to weeds which up to now have only been controlled up to now with total herbicides. At higher rates of application, all tested plants are so severely damaged in their development that they die. The invention also relates to herbicidal compositions which contain as an active ingredient a novel compound of formula I as defined hereinabove. Preferred methods of controlling weeds make use of the novel compounds. In the method for controlling weeds according to the invention the compounds of formula I are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in the art of formulation, and are therefore formulated in known manner to emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granulates, and also encapsulations in e.g. polymer substances. As with the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The formulations, i.e the compositions, preparations or mixtures containing the compound active ingredient of formula I and, where appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and or grinding the active ingredients with extenders, e.g. solvents, solid carriers and, where appropriate, surface active compounds surfactants . Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. xylene mixtures or substituted naphthalenes, phthalates such as dibutyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, alcohols and glycols and their ethers and esters, such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone, dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide, as well as vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils such as epoxidised coconut oil or soybean oil or water. The solid carriers used e.g. for dusts and dispersible powders are normally natural mineral fillers such as calcite, talcum, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. In order to improve the physical properties it is also possible to add highly dispersed silicic acid or highly dispersed absorbent polymers. Suitable granulated adsorptive carriers are porous types, for example pumice, broken brick, sepiolite or bentonite and suitable nonsorbent carriers are materials such as calcite or sand. In addition, a great number of pregranulated materials of inorganic or organic nature can be used, e.g. especially dolomite or pulverised plant residues. Depending on the nature of the compound of formula I to be formulated, suitable surface active compounds are nonionic, cationic and or anionic surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The term surfactants will also be understood as comprising mixtures of surfactants. Suitable anionic surfactants can be both water soluble soaps and water soluble synthetic surface active compounds. Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, earth alkaline metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids C₁₀ C₂₂ , e.g. the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which can be obtained e.g. from coconut oil or tallow oil. Mention may also be made of fatty acid methyltaurin salts. More frequently, however, so called synthetic surfactants are used, especially fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylarylsulfonates. The fatty sulfonates or sulfates are usually in the form of alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or unsubstitued or substituted ammonium salts and contain a C₈ C₂₂alkyl radical which also includes the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals, e.g. the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulfonic acid, of dodecylsulfate or of a mixture of fatty alcohol sulfates obtained from natural fatty acids. These compounds also comprise the salts of sulfuric acid esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 sulfonic acid groups and one fatty acid radical containing 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulfonates are the sodium, calcium or triethylanolamine salts of dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid formaldehyde condensation product. Also suitable are corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of the phosphoric acid ester of an adduct of p nonylphenol with 4 to 14 moles of ethylene oxide, or phospholipids. Non ionic surfactants are preferably polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, or saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives containing 3 to 10 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenols. Further suitable non ionic surfactants are the water soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide with polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol and alkylpolypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. These compounds usually contain 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Representative examples of non ionic surfactants are nonylphenolpolyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers, polypropylene polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate, are also suitable non ionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants are preferably quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as N substituent, at least one C₈ C₂₂alkyl radical and, as further substituents, unsubstituted or halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl or hydroxy lower alkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates, e.g. stearyltrimethylammonium chloride or benzyldi 2 chloroethyl ethylammonium bromide. The surfactants customarily employed in the art of formulation are described e.g. in the following publications The herbicidal compositions which are preferably employed in the process of the invention usually contain 0.1 to 95 , preferably 0.1 to 80 , of a compound of formula I , Preferred formulations are composed in particular of the following constituents percentage by weight Some of the compounds of the formula I which are used as active ingredients in the method for controlling weeds in accordance with the invention are listed in the following tables with the purpose of illustrating the invention and not of limiting it thereto. The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention in all its aspects and not to limit it thereto. The active ingredient is thoroughly mixed with the adjuvants and the mixture is thoroughly ground in a suitable mill, affording wettable powders which can be diluted with water to give suspensions of the desired concentration. Emulsions of any required concentration can be obtained from this concentrate by dilution with water. Dusts which are ready for use are obtained by mixing the active ingredient with the carriers, and grinding the mixture in a suitable mill. The active ingredient is mixed and ground with the adjuvants, and the mixture is subsequently moistened with water. The mixture is extruded and then dried in a stream of air. The finely ground active ingredient is uniformly applied, in a mixer, to the kaolin moistened with polyethylene glycol. Non dusty coated granulates are obtained in this manner. The finely ground active ingredient is intimately mixed with the adjuvants, giving a suspension concentrate from which suspensions of any desired concentration can be obtained by dilution with water. Emulsions of any required concentration can be produced from such concentrates by dilution with water. These solutions are suitable for application in the form of microdrops. The active ingredient is dissolved in methylene chloride, the solution is sprayed onto the carrier, and the solvent is subsequently evaporated off in vacuo. Ready for use dusts are obtained by intimately mixing the carriers with the active ingredient. In a greenhouse, immediately after sowing the test plants in seed dishes, the surface of the soil is treated with an aqueous dispersion of the test compounds, obtained from a 25 emulsifiable concentrate or from a 25 wettable powder with test compounds, which, on account of their insufficient solubility, cannot be formulated to emulsifiable concentrates. Two different concentration series were used, corresponding to 1 and 0.5 kg of test compound per hectare respectively. The seed dishes are kept in the greenhouse at 22 25 C and 50 70 relative humidity. The test is evaluated 3 weeks later in accordance with the following rating In this test, the tested compounds of formula I were most effective against monocot grass weeds, whereas no or only insignificant damage was caused to cultivated plants such as maize at the given rates of application. A large number of weeds and cultivated plants are sprayed post emergence in the 4 to 6 leaf stage with an aqueous active ingredient dispersion in rates of 4 and 2 kg of test compound per hectare and kept at 24 26 C and 45 60 relative humidity. The test was evaluated at least 15 days after treatment in accordance with the same rating as employed in the preemergence test. In this test, the compounds of formula I were also most effective against the tested weeds. The cultivated plants such as maize and rice were either not damaged or only damaged at higher application rates of the tested compound. 25 days old rice shoots of the variety Yamabiko were transplanted into large plastic containers. Into the same containers seeds of the weeds occurring in rice crops, namely alisma, ammonia, cyperus, echinochloa, eleocharis, fimbristylis, scirpus and monochoria, were sown between the rice plants. The containers were watered to such an extent, that a water layer of 2.5 cm covers the surface. After 3 days under green house conditions, the diluted aqueous dispersions of the active compounds were added to the water layer at a rate of application of 500, 250, 125, 60, 30 and 15 g a.i. per hectare. The containers were then kept covered with water at a temperature of 25 C and high humidity in a greenhouse for 4 weeks.
