# Improvements in or relating to apparatus and methods for wrapping plastics labels around containers.

## Abstract
Apparatus and methods are disclosed for a high speed production line in which containers 8 are wrapped with plastics labels 10 each having an outer surface and an underside which is next to the container 10 and comprising a first solid polymer layer 20 or a foam polymer layer 60 , including means 23, 38, 45 for moving a leading edge 61 of a label 10 to the periphery 12 of a rotating vacuum drum 5 , means for applying a solvent, such as methylene chloride when the polymer is polystyrene, to the underside of the layer to form finite areas 64 on the leading label edge 61 and a finite 66 on the trailing edge 68 . The finite area 65, 66 have therein a rapidly solidifying tacky solution of the polymer in the solvent, the tacky viscous solutions rapidly solidifying to form an adhesive bond. The solvent applied label 10 is quickly moved to a label wrapping station where it is wrapped around a container 8 , the finite areas 65 on the leading edge 61 tacking the label 10 to the container 8 , and the finite area 66 on the trailing edge 68 forming a cohesive bond on the seam formed by the overlapped label ends.
