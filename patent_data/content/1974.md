# Tie with locking head.

## Abstract
A tie for forming a plurality of elongate objects 58 into a bundle and for holding two objects together. The tie includes an elongate strap 22 having a plurality of spaced abutments 36 therealong and a metal locking head 24 jointed to one end of the strap 22 . The locking head 24 comprises a floor 26 with a strap receiving aperture 28 therethrough and a locking tongue 30 for engaging one of the abutments 36 . The tongue 30 and floor 26 are joined by a resilient neck 32 from which the tongue 30 extends toward the floor 26 to at least partially overlie the aperture 28 . Threading of the strap 22 causes the tongue 30 to deflect away from the floor 26 and the tongue 30 lockingly engages one of the abutments 36 upon attempted retrograde movement of the strap 22 .
