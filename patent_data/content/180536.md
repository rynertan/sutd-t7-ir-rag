## Description
Description Acrylic Automotive Refinish Coating CompositionTechnical Field The field of art to which this invention pertains is coating compositions, and particularly acrylic coating compositions for automotive refinish use.Background Art Conventional two package clear urethane based coating refinish systems use a comparatively low molecular weight isocyanate reacted with a medium to low molecular weight copolymer of ethylenically unsaturated monomers and a monohydroxy alkyl monomethacrylate. These clear finishes have generally good properties for the refinishing of automobiles. However, such conventional systems suffer from disadvantages under certain unfavorable conditions occasionally found in the auto refinishing environment. For example, their low molecular weight, while providing a high solids content for spraying, tends to slow initial drying dust free time which can result in undesirable dirt pickup. To overcome this problem, conventional solution acrylic lacquers are sometimes used. But while these lacquers have short dust free times, they have low solids content for spraying.Furthermore, a problem with the isocyanate containing compositions mentioned above is that the inclusion of the low molecular weight isocyanates are thought to cause a greater health hazard than if medium or high molecular weight isocyanates could be used. Accordingly, what is needed in this art is a coating composition particularly adapted for automotive refinish use which overcomes these problems.Disclosure of Invention The present invention is directed to an acrylic resin based coating composition particularly adapted to automotive refinish use. The composition comprises a copolymer of ethylenically unsaturated monomers and an isocyanato alkylmethacrylate reacted with a polyol cross linking agent. The ethylenically unsaturated monomers typically comprise an alkyl acrylate or methacrylate and a vinyl unsaturation containing compound. The polyol cross linking agent is typically added to the copolymer in conjunction with a curing catalyst and ultraviolet light stabilizing compounds. Another aspect of the invention is a method of coating a metal substrate with the above composition by combining the copolymer with the cross linking agent prior to application and curing the applied coating under ambient conditions, and the resultant coated article. Both the composition and method are particularly useful as part of a multicoat coating system in colorless form applied over a previously applied color layer. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description.Best Mode For Carrying Out The Invention The alkyl group in the alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate according to the present invention can be methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl etc. The preferred material is methyl methacrylate. Mixtures of the above materials, for example butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate e.g. 20 to 25 butyl and 55 to 60 methyl can also be used. The preferred vinyl unsaturation containing monomer is preferably a vinyl aromatic compound such as styrene or vinyl toluene.The alkyl groups on the isocyanato alkyl methacrylate can be the same as recited above. The preferred isocyanato material is isocyanato ethyl methacrylate. Useful cross linking polyols include the various glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, butylene glycol, 1,4 butanediol, hexylene glycol, l hexanediol, the polyglycols such as diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol, etc the triols such as glycerine, trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, etc., and other higher functional alcohols such as pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, as well as alkyds, polyesters, and acrylic copolymers, with hydroxyl functionality, and the like. Tone polycaprolactone polyols UnionCarbide Corporation are particularly preferred. In preparing the acrylic copolymer the alkyl acrylate or methacrylate is preferably used at about 30 to about 90 by weight of the copolymer typically 50 to 80 , and preferably 75 or 80 with the isocyanato alkyl methacrylate representing up to 20 by weight of the copolymer although in some instances it may be used as high as 70 and preferably up to 10 by weight. The balance of the copolymer can be any vinyl unsaturation containing monomers and is preferably a vinyl aromatic such as styrene or vinyl toluene. Styrene is a particularly preferred component because of the hardness, gloss and compatability in solution it provides to the copolymer when combined with the polyol composition.Typically the styrene is present at about 10 by weight, the alkyl acrylate or methacrylate is present at about 80 by weight with the isocyanato compound representing about 10 by weight. Also present in the copolymer composition is a vinyl polymerization initiator such as VAZOw 67 E. I. Dupont de Nemours BR Co. . This is typically used in relatively large amounts e.g. up to about 10 by weight and typically up to about 5 by weight based on weight of copolymer components to keep the molecular weight relatively low. The copolymer typically has a relatively low molecular weight, e.g. approximately 20,000 number average molecular weight. The molecular weight is controlled so that the polymer flows out sufficiently to form an attractive coating, while maintaining durable properties after application. The compositions are typically prepared in two parts for combination just prior to application. The first part represents the acrylic copolymer portion.The second part is represented by the polyol cross linking agent and various additives. The polyol composition can comprise any cross linking polyol as described above. In addition, the polyol portion typically contains ultraviolet light screening agents, absorbers, or stabilizers, which for simplicity will be referred to collectively as stabilizers such as, TINUVINe 328 or 292 Cibo Geigy Corp. substituted hydroxyphenyl benzotriazoles and hindred amine light stabilizers.In addition, an organic solvent soluble curing catalyst is also used in the polyol portion of the composition. This catalyst is typically an organometallic compound containing an alkyl group methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, etc. , a metal zinc, tin, etc. and a fatty acid ester group laurate, oleate, etc. . Dibutyl tin dilaurate is particularly preferred. Sufficient polyol is typically used to provide adequate hardness and gloss properties. Sufficient ultraviolet stabilizing agents are used to impart color stability to the layer upon which the coating composition is to be applied, as well as providing stability to the clear, acrylic copolymer polyol combination itself. And sufficient curing catalyst is used to provide cure in a reasonable period of time. Typically the polyol is present by weight based on total reactants in an amount of about 10 to about 25 , preferably 15 to about 20 , the U. V. agents up to about 8 , preferably up to about 4 , and the catalyst up to about 0.1 and preferably up to about 0.03 . The individual components are shelve stable, i.e. do not react upon storage over long periods of time.Both compositions are prepared in conventional organic paint solvents including aromatic solvents such as toluene, xylene, etc., aliphatic and hydrocarbon solvents, esters and ketones, etc. Typically, prior to combination, the copolymer composition is present in the solvent at about 55 to about 65 by weight and about 10 to about 40 preferably about 25 to about 35 after combination with the cross linking portion. After mixing, the coating composition is ready for application. Although the composition is particularly suitable for application to metal substrates, and as a refinish composition for automobile substrates in particular, it can of course be used on other substrates such as plastic and flexible rubber as well. Also, while the composition may contain coloring agents, it is preferably used as a clear composition to provide protection and luster to a previously applied color coat. The coating composition according to the present invention can be applied on top of a dry base coat film pigmented or unpigmented of any commercial lacquer such as Alpha Cryle acrylic InmontCorporation .

Although the coating is specifically designed for ambient room temperature cure, cure of course can be accelated through the application of heat.
