# Semiconductor device with fuse.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device with a fuse comprises an insulating layer 2 having at least one step, a fusible film 5 on the insulating layer and crossing the step, and a covering film 8 formed on the fusible film. When the fusible film 8 is irradiated with a laser beam 12 at the step, a portion of the fusible film on the upper surface of the insulating layer 2 melts and flows onto the lower surface of the insulating layer without forming a hole, thereby separating the fusible film 5 at the step.
