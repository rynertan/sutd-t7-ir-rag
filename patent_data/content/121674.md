# Tape machine support.

## Abstract
An improved tape applying device 12 is provided. A number of tape roll support spindles 34 are pivotally moun ted to a wrapping sprocket 14 which rotates about an axis 18 . The spindles 34 support tape rolls 22 . As the wrap ping sprocket 14 rotates, the tape from these tape rolls are wrapped about a pipe 26 . A rigid ring 66 is supported on a number of struts 50 spaced from and coaxial with the wrapping sprocket 14 . A brace arm assembly 69 is secured between the ring 66 and selected spindles 34 to oppose centrifugal forces generated when the annular member rotates to apply the tape to the pipe.
