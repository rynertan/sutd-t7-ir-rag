# Method of manufacturing a LOCOS semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a circuit element, for example a transistor, in a semiconductor body. The p n junctions between the zones adjoin a sunken oxide pattern. In order to avoid emitter collector short circuit, a first base doping step is carried out after providing the sunken oxide pattern, after which a mask is provided which, together with the sunken oxide pattern, forms an aperture, and a second base doping step is carried out, followed by emitter doping and emitter metallization via the same aperture. Channel stopper diffusion in the epitaxial layer may be omitted, which presents advantages in particular in IÂ²L.
