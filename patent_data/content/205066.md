# The preparation of polysiloxanes from halosilanes.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polysiloxanes by reacting halosilanes in the presence of metal oxides and sulfolane. Preferred metal oxides include anti mony III oxide, antimony V oxide, cadmium oxide, calcium oxide, copper II oxide, indium oxide, iron II oxide, iron III oxide, magnesium oxide, manganese II oxide, mercury II oxide, nickel II oxide, thallium III oxide, tin II oxide, and zinc oxide, improved yields and rates of reaction can be observed with the process of this invention.
