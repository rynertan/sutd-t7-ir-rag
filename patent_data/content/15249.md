# A METHOD OF COMMINUTING FOR COMBUSTION SUCH WOOD OR CELLULOSE MATERIAL AS IS PRECOMPRESSED, OR BOARD OR STRIP LIKE PER SE, AND AN APPARATUS FOR CARRYING OUT THE METHOD

## Abstract
A method and a machine for comminuting precompacted or board like cellulose material, especially for feeding a stoker plant, for example, while using a roll pair 4, 5 for receiving the material, where each roll e.g. 4 is provided about its periphery with alternating projections 6 and depressions 7 corresponding to depressions 7 and projections 6 on the second roll 5 in each such pair, which is driven with the same peripheral velocity for both rolls 4, 5 . Said projections 6 and depressions 7 along the periphery and axially can have pyramidal shape, for example, the distance between the rolls being adjustable such that the sum of the radius to the crest of a projection 6 on one roll 4 and the radius to the bottom of a depression 7 on the corresponding roll 5 and complemen tal to said projection 6 is less that the distance between the central axes 9, 10 of the rolls.
