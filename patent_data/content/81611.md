## Description
Background of the Invention This invention relates to a process for the electrochemical reduction of terephthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid HMBA and more particularly to improvements in the electrical efficiency of the said reaction and to operation by treatment of the cathode to obtain a mercury overlay as an amalgam on the cathode surface and the addition of a soluble salt of mercury, which regenerates the amalgam overlay, to the electrolysis catholyte solvent. Inasmuch as the cost of electric power utilization in the electrochemical conversion of tere phthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid has a direct bearing on the economics of this process it is highly desirable to increase current efficiency and to hold side reactions which do not lead to the desired product to a minimum.If only one series of reactions were taking place in the instant process, that is, the electrochemical reduction of terephthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid at the cathode, the ideal of 100 conversion of the star ting material to the desired product would be achieved. However, as in the case with most electrochemical reactions, this particular reaction is not so simple and many competing reactions can take place in the electrolysis cell.The resulting presence of 4 carboxybenzaldehyde 4 CBA , dihydroxymethylbenzene, toluic acid and other impurities render resulting hydroxymethylbenzoic acid undesirable for use as a monomer for polymer applications without further expensive purification. It is well known that in the cathodic reduction of carboxylic acids that two types of products can result, either the corresponding aldehyde in a twoelectron process or the hydroxymethyl compound in a four electron process wherein the aldehyde is further reduced to the alcohol. M. Baizer, Organic Electrochemistry, Dekker, N.Y., 1973 , 414 . The alcohol can be further reduced to the methyl group. A further complication in the electrolysis of terephthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid is the development, as the electrolysis proceeds, of a deactivating or poisoning layer which accumulate on the cathode if a solid cathode such as lead is used.Current efficiency accordingly suffers. Continuous mercury cathode cells have been developed for the electrolytic reduction of phthalic acid to overcome this same problem P. C. Condit, IEC, 48, 1252 1956 .However, use of solid cathodes versus the use of liquid cathodes has the advantage of simplicity in construction and versatility. In the prior art, it is known that the reduction of aromatic carboxylic acids at lead or mercury cathodes in a protic solvent proton donor i.e., alcoholic, etc., gives excellent yields of corresponding benzyl alcohols Chem. Ber ., 38, 1747 1905 ibid, 39, 2933 1906 Ann., 417, 69 1929 Org. Syn. 21, 10 1941 .Baizer op. cit. 417 suggests that the mechanism of this process in strongly acidic alcoholic media may be that the carboxylic acid is reduced in its protonated form, RCOOH2, or that the acid first forms an ester with the alcoholic solvent, the ester being more reducible than the acid. Ono, Nippon Kagaku Zasshi, 75, 1195 9. 1954 CA51 12704b teaches that electrolytic reduction of phLhalic and isophthalic acid and their esters using a mercury cathode gave two types of reactions, reduction of the side chain and the benzene ring, phthalic acid giving dihydrophthalic acid and dimethyl isophthalate giving m hydroxymethylbenzoic acid. Ono, et al., J. Chem. Soc., Japan, Pure Chem.Section, 74, 907 11 1953 CA48 8082d reported electrolytic reduction of dimethyl terephthalate to g methylhydroxymethylbenzoate using a mercury cathode.German Offenlegungsschrift 24 28 878 teaches a process for production of hydroxymethylbenzoic acid esters by electrochemical reduction of dimethylterephthalate on solid electrode cathodes lead, zinc, cadmium, graphite and amalgamated metals lead, copper, etc. with methanol as solvent. However, the poisoning effect has plagued the application of electrolytic reduction processes t6 aromatic carboxylic acids.Natarajan, et al., Electrochem. Technol., 2 5 6 , 151 6 1964 CA61 6940c reports in the electrolytic reduction of benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol using a rotating lead cathode, the reaction proceeds with good current efficiency until the electrolyte is saturated with benzyl alcohol, at which point the cathode becomes covered with a layer of benzyl alcohol, effectively hindering the diffusion of benzyl alcohol with re sultant decrease in current efficiency. GermanOffenlegungsschrift 26 42 496 teaches a process for the production of E hydroxymethylbenzoic acid by the electrochemical reduction of terephthalic acid in the presence of ammonia a basic protic solvent using electrodes such as mercury, lead, cadmium and antimony.Lead is indicated as especially suitable. Unfortunately, activity drops off rapidly after a few minutes. The problem of maintaining cathode activity is met by discontinuing the direct current perio lically and shorting out the cell for periods of 1 2 to 3 minutes.From the physical constants given in this publication for the hydroxymethylbenzoic acid melting point of 182.5 to 183.50C conversion 100 and selectivity 91 it is probable that the electrochemical product of terephthalic acid is not a pure product but contains 4 carboxybenzaldehyde or toluic acid. The large excess of current taught as used, 15.3 Faradays, 4.0Faradays being 100 of theoretical, indicates the difficulty of maintaining cathode activity of a lead cathode. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to develop an electrochemical process for the manufacture of hydroxymethylbenzoic acid from terephthalic acid which avoids the above disadvantages.It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for production of g hydroxymethylbenzoic acid wherein the production of by product impurities, namely, 4 carboxybenzáldehyde, dihydroxymethylbenzene and toluic acid is minimized. It is a further object of this invention to increase the current efficiency of the electrochemical reduction process over that of previously known methods for electrochemical reduction of terephthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid.It is another object of this invention to provide an efficient continuous process for the electrochemical production of p hydroxymethylbenzoic acid wherein discontinuance of the reductive process is not required by the development of a poisoning barrier upon the cathode. Other objects will appear hereinafter. Summary of the Invention Terephthalic acid is electrochemically reduced to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid in a process in an electrolysis cell in which a the cathode is solid and metal with a mercury overlay as an amalgam surface and has a hydrogen overvoltage which is greater than the potential for the reduction of terephthalic acid to hydro.xymethylbenzoic acid, and b sufficient mercury is added as a mercury compound to maintain the process.Addition of a mercury compound is essential. For example, current efficiency decreases in continuous operation and cathode amalgam surfaces lose amalgamation without addition of a mercury compound. Details of the Invention The term current efficiency is defined as ratio of consumption in Faradays used to make product to total Faradays used times 100. The term amalgam is defined as referring only to an alloy of mercury. The present invention provides a process for the electrochemical preparation of hydroxymethylbenzoic acid with improved current efficiency and minimal production of by product impurities. The process comprises performing the cathodic reduction in an electrolysis cell having a cathode compartment and an anode compartment. The anode and cathode compartments can be separated by a cation exchange diaphragm, although the presence of a separating diaphragm is not an essential element of the invention. If a separating diaphragm is used, the cathode and anode and the separating diaphragm are preferably in parallel planes.Advantageously, several of the elementary electrolysis cells can be combined in the manner of a filter press. In general, any metal with a higher hydrogen overvoltage than the potential for the reduction of terephthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid which will form an alloy with lead and an amalgam with mercury is suitable. Examples of material forming the cathode are lead and alloys of lead with cadmium, antimony, tin or bismuth. The cathode is prepared by abraiding in a suitable manner the surface of the solid cathode to remove any metal oxidation and then contacting the abraided metallic surface with mercury to form the amalgam. In the case of lead, it is sufficient to abraid the surface of the lead solid to remove all forts of lead oxide and any other impurities.Liquid mercury of 99.9 purity is used as a bath for the abraided solid lead cathode. In the case of lead, the lead amalgam is formed in the surface of the lead at room temperature upon contacting the mercury bath. The anode of the electrolysis cell usually con sists of a solid electrically conducting material which is electrochemically stable in the anolyte and under the operating conditions considered. Examples of such materials are metals and metalloids such as platinum, platinised titanium, graphite, lead and its alloys, particularly with silver, antimony or tin. Optionally, any known cation exchange membrane can be used to separate the catholyte from the anolyte, but membranes of the homogeneous type are preferred.These membranes optionally can be reinforced with a screen. For carrying out electrolysis operations over a long period, it is naturally preferred to use membranes which do not swell and which are stable to the action of the various constituents of the catholyte and the anolyte. Examples of such membranes are those of Nafion trademark of E. I. DuPont de Nemours Co. perfluorosulfonic acid. The catholyte can comprise a neutral solvent, a weakly basic solvent or an aprotic solvent i.e., acetonitrile, to which a source of protons has been added. Examples of neutral solvents are water, methanol and other alcohols mixed with water to obtain necessary solvent properties. Examples of basic solvents are ammonia, methylamine, ethylenediamine which are diluted suitably to maintain a weak basic condition. In a suitable method of operation, the catholyte consists of a solvent, preferably water, and terephthalic acid with a soluble ammonium salt and ammonia. At the start of electrolysis, the catholyte contains sufficient ammonia to form a diammonium salt of terephthalic acid.Less ammonium salt is required as the electrolysis process proceeds. Concentration of ammonia as ammonium hydroxide is within the range of from about 1 gram of ammonium hydroxide per 2 grams of terephthalic acid to about 1 gram of anunonium hydroxide per gram of terephthalic acid and wherein the pit of the resulting solution is at least 6.5, preferably with a pH within the range of from about 8.5 to about 9.5. The concentrations of terephthalic acid and ammonium salt can be either constant when the reaction is carried out continuously, or variable when the reaction is carried out discontinuously.In all cases, the concentration of terephthalic acid is less than the saturation concentration at the temperature of electrolysis generally, this concentration is greater than 2 by weight, and preferably greater than 3 when the current density is high, these values relating particularly to the constant concentration when the reaction is carried out continuously and to the final concentration when the reaction is carried out discontinuously. The concentration of ammonium salt is usually between about 0.1 to about 10 by weight, and preferably between about 0.1 to about 1.0 by weight, these values relating particularly to the total solution of water, terephthalic acid and other solution components when the reaction is carried out continuously and to the final solution when the reaction is carried out discontinuously.The ammonium salt can be any ammonium salt but a salt selected from the group consisting of ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate and ammonium carbonate is preferred. The catholyte can also contain reaction by products in small amounts, generally less than 1 by weight. An aqueous acid solution is preferably used as the anolyte, though any other anolyte capable of providing electrical conductivity between the two electrodes can be used. Aqueous solutions of sulphuric or phosphoric acids are usually employed in a concentration generally of 0.1 to 5 mols liter, and preferably 0.5 to 2 mols liter. The current density at the cathode is within the range of from about 1 to about 200 amperes per decimeter squared A dm2 , preferably from about 20 to about 100 A dm2. The flow of the catholyte in a closed circuit is usually achieved by means of a pump. The circuit can in addition contain attached devices such as a heat exchanger or an expansion vessel. The expansion vessel enables terephthalic acid to be added to the catholyte and also some catholyte to be withdrawn in order to extract the hydroxymethylbenzoic acid.By product hydrogen is also removed. The anolyte can also be circulated, preferably in an anolyte circuit similar to that of the catholyte, so that the pressure on either side of the separating diaphragm can be substantially the same. At least one spacer is preferably present in the anode and cathode compartment if a cation exchange membrane is used. These spacers serve to prevent deformations of the cation exchange membrane and prevent contact between this membrane and the electrodes. These spacers also help to render uniform the spacing between the membrane and electrodes which contains the electrolyte. These spacers are generally manufactured from synthetic polymers which are chemically inert and which do not conduct electricity they can be made in the form of interlaced, intertwined, noted or welded yarns e.g., woven fabrics, grids or nets or they can be in the form of plates possessing holes or grooves. In practice, these spacers are oriented along planes which are parallel to those of the electrodes and the separating diaphragm. Terephthalic acid reduction can be monitored to obtain 100 conversion. Less than 100 conversion is preferable. Less than 96 conversion is more preferable.Undesirable by products are produced at high conversion levels. Increased amounts of impurities such as dihydroxymethylbenzene and toluic acid can result at terephthalic acid conversion levels of greater than 95 96 . Percent conversion is preferably balanced to obtain maximum conversion to 2 hydroxymethylbenzoic acid and minimum conversion to undesirable by products. Terephthalic acid, under ambient conditions being virtually insoluble in water, requires a weak base as a reactant to form a soluble salt in water. Examples of suitable weak bases are ammonia, methylamine and ethylenediamine but any similar weak base can be used. In the practice of the invented electrolysis process a weak base such as ammonia and a salt such as an ammonium salt are added initially to the catholyte, the ammonia in a concentration sufficient to dissolve the terephthalate acid in the solvent, i.e., water, liquid ammonia, etc. but which is preferably water, and a ammonium salt to carry the current. After an initial period of operation, a monoammonium salt of terephthalic acid is added to maintain a basic condition sufficient to cause additions of terephthalic acid to dissolve, with pH above 6.5 and preferably with a pH within the range of about 8.5 to about 9.5, to insure complete solubility of the terephthalic acid.Concurrently with the addition of the monoammonium salt of terephthalic acid, a mercury compound, preferably a solvent soluble mercury salt, is added to the catholyte in an amount sufficient to maintain the continuous process, to provide a minimum concentration of mercury metal ion of from about 5 to 1000 parts per million ppm expressed as the metal. Concentrations of mercury metal ions greater than 1000 ppm can be used if suitable. Examples of mercury salts soluble in aqueous solutions are mercuric acetate, mercuric bromide, mercuric chlorate, mercuric chloride, mercuric cyanicje. Mercuric acetate is preferred because of high solubility and. easy availability. At the end of electrolysis, the g hydro.symethyl benzoic acid is isolated from the electrolyte by known means, which optionally can be by the difference in water solubility between that of terephthalic acid and p hydroxymethylbenzoic acid. Using this method, the catholyte is acidified and filtered hot, within a temperature range of from about 750C to about 1000C, to remove terephthalic acid. The g hydroxymethylbenzoic acid is obtained by cooling the mother liquor, optionally after concentrating under reduced pressure. The cooling is carried out at temperatures below 400C and preferably below 250C, the degree of concentration and the cooling temperature naturally vary according to the degree of purity desired for the g hydroxmethylben zoic acid. The process of the invention possesses numerous advantages in addition to the advantages of continuous operation it makes it possible to use catholyte solutions which facilitate workup and recovery of the hydroxymethylbenzoic acid it allows electrolysis cells to be produced which are compact and easy to dismantle it allows gases to be removed easily which are produced at the anode, especially oxygen, and are capable of causing high resistance between the electrodes due to gas bubbles it makes it possible to use high current densities and to achieve easily the supply of electricity in series between the various elementary electrolysis cells in an assembly of several cells it makes it possible to use cells with vertical electrodes.Finally, due to the constant geometrical shape of the preferred electrolysis cells, the anolyte and the catholyte can be circulated very rapidly, enabling lower concentrations of terephthalic acid to be employed and, as a result, better degrees of conversion can be obtained in continuous operation. The following examples illustrate the invention.The chemical yields indicated are yields of g hydroxy methylbenzoic acid relative to initial quantities of terephthalic acid present. Concentrations of so lutions are expressed as the number of grams of solute per liter of solution. EXAMPLE I Batch reduction of terephthalic acid to p hydroxy methylbenzoic acid was carried out in an electrolysis cell in the following manner. The cell was mounted in an oil bath which was used to heat the electrolyte to reaction temperature before starting and to cool the electrolyte once the reaction had started. The oil bath was fitted with an electric heater, a source of cooling comprising coils filled with cooling water and a mechanical stirring means. The cell was a 600 ml glass beaker fitted with a stopper of fluorocarbon rubber. Holes through the stopper gave entrance to a thermometer, the anode leads and the cathode leads.The anode support was a glass anolyte tube which was fitted with a fluorocarbon plastic holder to support the anode and a semi permeable membrane. The anode was a circular platinum screen about 2.5 cm in diameter.The membrane was of sulfonated fluorocarbon polymer.The glass tube served as the anolyte chamber. The fluorocarbon plastic holder was inclined at an angle from the horizontal to permit gases rising from the cathode to escape. The cathode was a metal disc about 6 cm in diameter. The cathode was of electrolytically pure lead of 99.9 purity. A magnetic stirring bar was placed on top of the cathode disc in the bottom of the glass beaker which served as the electrolysis cell. In operation, the catholyte solution was placed in the cell with the cathode and with the stirring bar in place. The anode was inserted in the anolyte chamber, the chamber was filled with anolyte and inserted in the fluorocarbon stopper. The anolyte chamber was thereupon checked for membrane leakage and placed on the cell. The thermometers were inserted in the fluorocarbon stopper and the cell was assembled. Heat can be applied to the completed cell by means of an oil bath to reach the necessary temperature at which time the heat application is stopped. The cooling system is thereupon activated and as soon as the cell temperature began to drop, the electrolysis reaction is started by applying a source of direct current. Alternatively, the reaction could be started at room temperature and reach operating temperature without direct heating. Alternatively, the cell could be operated without the presence of a semipermeable membrane. Current density was controlled so as to maintain consumption of electricity slightly below the calculated quantity of 4 Faradays required for one equivalent weight of terephthalic acid. An aqueous solution of 2 sulfuric acid, approximately 0.2 mols liter of water, was used as the anolyte.The catholyte consisted of water, terephthalic acid, ammonia and a soluble ammonium salt, ammonium carbonate NH4 2CO3 . The cathode was lead. Results are inTable I. Comparative data from German Offen. No.2,642,496 are included. Current efficiency C.E. of 496 is calculated.

Run 5302 26 b using interrupted operation resulted in lower conversion of terephthalic acid thanRuns No. 5302 24 and 28, indicating that interrupted operation did not improve current efficiency under these conditions.

Comparison of the data in Tables I and II indicates that ammonium chloride is a more suitable electrolyte salt with a lead cathode than either ammonium carbonate or ammonium sulfate. The chloride ion is at least twice as effective as the carbonate or sulfate ions. EXAMPLE III The procedure of Example I was repeated using ammonium chloride and ammonium sulfate as the ammonium salts and mercury as the cathode.

The above data indicate the improvement in terephthalic acid conversion and increased yield of gHMBA obtained with mercury cathode at high current efficiency versus results obtained with lead cathode inExamples I and II. The data indicate ammonium salts of sulfate or chloride are equally suitable with mercury cathode whereas ammonium chloride is preferable with lead cathode as shown in Table It of Example II. Toluíc acid also resulted as product in Runs No. 5302 144, 162 and 136 in Table III. Continuation ofRun No. 5302 136 to 180 minutes resulted in a rapid increase in production of toluic acid and production of 2 ylenediol. Current efficiency dropped. pENIBA was converted to other products toluic acid and p sylenediol . EXAMPLE IV The procedure of Example I was repeated using a lead amalgam cathode. The lead amalgam was prepared by abraiding the surface of electrolytically pure lead to remove any metal oxidation and then contacting the abraided metal surface with mercury to form the amalgam. Mercury of 99.9 purity was used as the bath for the abraided solid lead cathode. The lead amalgam of mercury formed in the surface of the lead at room temperature. Results are in Table IV.

The above data indicate the high conversion of terephthalic acid to hydroxymethylbenzoic acid HMBA and improved current efficiency with lead amalgam cathode versus lead cathode. Current efficiency improved over use of a lead cathode as indicated in Tables I and II. Less toluic acid resulted than with use of a mercury cathode as shown inTable III. EXAMPLE V Two continuous reductions of terephthalic acid to g hydroxymethylbenzoic acid were carried out in an electrolysis cell in the following manner to compare the current efficiency obtained with a lead cathode and with a lead amalgam cathode in continuous operation.One cathode was electrically pure lead. The other cathode was electrically pure lead amalgamated with 99. 9 pure mercury. In construction the two compartment electrolysis cell comprised an inlet plate of polyvinylchloride PVC which was fitted to a second plate of the same size of lead amalgam which constituted the cathode. PVC inserts between the cathode plate and the semipermeable membrane acted as spacers to separate the cathode and membrane sufficiently to permit catholyte flow. The anode was an electrically pure 1 2 inch titanium plate coated with platinum to a thickness of 250 micro inches. Anode and membrane were separated by PVC spacers to permit the anolyte to flow through the cell. An external reservoir for the anolyte served as an oxygen gas separator.An external reservoir for the catholyte served as a hydrogen gas separator. In operation, electrolyte was continuously pumped from the reservoir to the electrolysis cell and returned to the reservoir through a heat exchanger. No addition of a mercury salt was made to either catholyte. Details are inTable V.

Data in Table V indicate that even though a more efficient electrolyte was used with the lead cathode, better results were obtained with the lead amalgam cathode with an electrolyte which gave poor results with the lead cathode. However, with continuous operation, current efficiency declined to inefficient levels with both cathodes and both electrolytes. EXAiPLE VI Amalgam analyses were made before and after a continuous reduction to determine if loss of mercury from the lead amalgam surface of the cathode occurred in an electrochemical reduction of terephthalic acid.Accordingly, energy dispersion analyses of X rays EDAX to obtain qualitative and quantitative analysis of the amalgam cathode surface were made before and after the run 5593 140 reported in Example V. Mercury content on the lead amalgam surface of the cathode had decreased after the run. Lead and iron content on the cathode surface had increased. After the run, the surface was lightly abraided to expose a fresh surface and the surface was again analyzed by EDAX. Results are in Table VI.

EXAMPLE VII The lead amalgam cathode used in Examples V andVI was re amalgamated in the procedure of Example IV.The procedure of Example V was repeated without any addition of mercury. The electrolyte was analyzed three times by atomic absorption AA of mercury using standard analytical techniques, twice before the 5 hour run and once after the 5 hour run. The first analysis was of the freshly prepared catholyte. The second analysis was after pumping the catholyte through the cell so as to contact the lead amalgam cathode.Mercury content of the catholyte was increased by contact with the lead amalgam cathode and, as indicated by the third analysis, decreased with subsequent reduction of terephthalic acid. Details are inTable VII.

EXAMPLE VIII In the procedure of Example V two continuous reductions of terephthalic acid were carried out in an electrolysis cell to compare current efficiency obtained with and without the addition of a mercury salt. The cathode was electrically pure lead amalgamated with 99.9 mercury. Periodic additions of mercuric acetate Hg Ac 2 were made each hour to the electrolysis cell during the course of the run. A control run was also made wherein mercuric acetate was not added to the electrolysis cell. The results of continuous operation using ammonium sulfate as the required salt are in Table VIII.

The data indicate that as the addition of mercury began to build beyond 80 parts per million ppm , the amount of hydrogen evolved began to decrease and the current efficiency C.E. began to increase. The above data indicate that the presence of over 100 ppm of mercury reversed the trend in current efficiency percent from a negative to a positive rate under the conditions of Example V. EXAMPLE IX The procedure of Example V was repeated in multiple runs using mercuric acetate additions in all runs.The same cathode used in Example VIII was used in Example IX without cleaning and or amalgamation with a mercury bath. The results of continuous operation using ammonium sulfate and one run with ammonium carbonate as the required salt and with addition of mercuric acetate over a period of days are in Table IS.
