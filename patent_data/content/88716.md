# TIMING CONTROL FOR FUEL INJECTION PUMP

## Abstract
The fuel injection pump comprises a cam ring 46 mounted for angular adjustment by means of a piston 50 to control injection timing. A fluid chamber 92 on one side of the piston 50 is in communication with a source of fluid under pressure correlated with engine speed and acting against the bias of a spring 80 arranged in a chamber 98 at the other side of the piston 50 . The chamber 98 at the other side of the piston being also in communication with a fluid under pressure and a drainage passage 106 controlled by a valve 104 being provided to control release of fluid from the chamber 98 . The valve 104 is actuable by a failsafe stepper motor 108 through a non reversible drive in response to at least one set of continuous measurements of an operating parameter of an associated engine indicative of engine temperature, altitude, fuel density, or fuel injection angle.
