# 3 Axle steered truck.

## Abstract
A truck 10 for use on a railway vehicle has 3 axles, one 20,26 located at each end of the truck 10 and a third 32 located generally centrally between the other two axles 20,26 . The two outboard axles 20,26 are pivotable about respective vertical axes so as to be free to move to a radial alignment when the truck 10 is travelling on curved track. The axle 32 located generally centrally between the other two axles is free to move laterally but is constrained to eliminate movement about a substantially vertical axis. Interconnecting means 74,74B are provided so that the lateral movement of the central axle 32 is used to guide the outboard axes 20,26 to the radial alignment.
