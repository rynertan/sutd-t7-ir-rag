## Description
ANTIPSYCHOTIC LEVOROTATORY ENANTIOMERS OF 3 HALOCYPROHEPTADINES, ANALOGS AND DERIVATIVESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with pharmaceutical compositions comprising levorotatory enantiomers of 3 halocyproheptadines and related compounds and their use as antipsychotic agents.It is also concerned with certain members of the group and their dextrorotatory counterparts which are novel compounds. Racemic 3 bromocyproheptadine and 3 chlorocyproheptadine are disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,014,911 as members of a large group of cyproheptadine derivatives which possess antiserotonin and antihistamine activity. They are also disclosed inJ. Med. Chem., 8, 829 1965 . The levorotatory enantiomer of 3 chlorocyproheptadine is disclosed by Ebnother et al., inHelv. Chim. Acta, 48 6 , 1237 1249 1965 . The levorotatory enantiomer of 3 iodocyproheptadine is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,031,223 and the levorotatory enantiomer of l cyclopropylmethyl 4 3 iodo 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,031,222. Now with this invention there are provided novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of these levorotatory 3 halocyproheptadines and analogs thereof as active ingredient, which are useful as antipsychotic agents. There is also provided a novel method of treating psychoses with these novel pharmaceutical compositions. There are also provided certain novel compounds within the class of 3 halocyproheptadines and analogs thereof and novel processes for synthesizing these novel compounds.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel compounds of this invention are the levorotatory and dextrorotatory enantiomers of the compound having the following structural formula EMI2.1 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein Xa represents bromo or chloro R represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, especially C1 3 alkyl, or fluoro RÚ represents methyl or cyclopropylmethyl, when is is bromo and R1 represents cyclopropylmethyl when Xa is chloro. A preferred embodiment of the novel compounds is that wherein R is hydrogen. An even more preferred embodiment of the novel compounds is that wherein R is hydrogen, and X is bromo. CL The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel compounds of this invention are acid addition salts formed from a novel compound and an organic or inorganic acid recognized by the art as providing a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfate, pamoate, citrate, napsylate, pyruvate, isethionate, maleate, fumarate, or the like. The salts are prepared by dissolving approximately equimolecular amounts of the free base compound and the desired acid in a solvent followed by crystallization of the salt product. The novel process for the preparation of the compounds of this invention comprises dehydration of an R substituted l R1 4 3 X CL 5 hydroxy 5H dibenzo a ,d cyclohepten 5 yl piperidine with a dehydrating agent such as trifluoroacetic acid trifluoroacetic anhydride at reflux temperature, as described in J.Med.Chem., 8, 829 1965 , to form a racemic mixture of the novel compounds of this invention.The racemic mixture is then resolved by formation of diastereomeric salts with it and an optically active acid such as di E toluoyl d tartaric acid in a solvent such as ethanol followed by separation of the diastereomeric pair of salts such as by fractional crystallization followed by separate treatment of each salt with an alkali such as an alkali metal hydroxide, bicarbonate or carbonate, especially sodium bicarbonate or carbonate to liberate the free and enantiomers. The levorotatory isomer is further resolved via recrystallization from a solvent such as acetonitrile. The optically enriched dextrorotatory compound obtained as described above can be racemized by heating a solution of it in an inert solvent until a sample fails to show optical activity. It is convenient to reflux a toluene solution for about 10 50 hours. In this manner, additional quantities of the racemic compound can be obtained from which additional levorotatory material can be isolated by the above described resolution. The compounds useful in the novel method of treatment and novel pharmaceutical formulations of this invention have structural formula EMI4.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R is as previously defined R1 is methyl or cyclopropylmethyl and X is halo, such as chloro, bromo, or iodo. It is preferred that R be hydrogen and X be bromo or iodo. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts contemplated for this purpose are the same salts discussed herein in connection with the group of novel compounds. As pointed out by Ebnother et al.,Helv. Chim. Acta, 48, 1237 1249 1965 these compounds exist as levorotatory and dextrorotatory optical enantiomers. All of the antipsychotic activity resides in the levorotatory enantiomers, but the racemic mixtures of the levo and dextrorotatory enantiomers, the mixture from which the levorotatory enantiomers are obtained are still potent antipsychotic agents and are useful in the novel method of treatment and novel pharmaceutical formulations of this invention. Thus there is contemplated for use in the novel method of treatment and pharmaceutical formulations 1 racemic mixtures of levo and dextrorotatory enantiomers, herein after referred to as racemic compounds and 2 any mixtures optically enriched in the levoratory sense or pure levoratotary enantiomers, hereinafter referred to as levorotatory compounds . The novel method of treatment of this invention comprises the administration of an antipsychotically effective amount of one of the racemic or levorotatory compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a psychotic patient.The route of administration can be oral, rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous. Doses of 0.1 to 20 mg. kg. day and preferably of 0.5 to 10 mg. kg. day of active ingredient are adequate, and if preferred, it can be administered in divided doses given two to four times daily. It is to be noted that the precise unit dosage form and dosage level depend upon the case history of the individual being treated and, consequently, are left to the discretion of the therapist. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound useful in the novel method of treatment as active ingredient may be in any art recognized form suitable for oral use, such as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders, or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups, or elixirs. For intravenous and intramuscular and subcutaneous use the pharmaceutical compositions may be in any art recognized form of a sterile injectable preparation such as a sterile aqueous or oleaginous solution or suspension. The amount of active ingredient incorporated in a unit dosage of the above described pharmaceutical compositions may be from 1 to 400 mg., and preferably from 5 to 250 mg.

Similarly tablets containing the other racemic or levorotatory compounds active in the novel method of treatment of this invention are prepared by substituting for the 100 mg 2.7 x 10 4 mole of l methyl 4 3 bromo 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine a comparable molecular amount of any of the racemic or levorotatory compounds with structural formula EMI12.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein X, R and R1 are as previously defined. PharmacologyI. Antagonism of Amphetamine Methods Mice CF1 females weighing about 20 g. were injected i.p. with the test compounds two hours and five minutes prior to a subcutaneous administration of amphetamine, 10 mg. kg.Forty five minutes after giving amphetamine, the mice were observed for the presence or absence of excitement and locomotor stimulation elicited by amphetamine. Results At a dose of 30 mg. kg. of l methyl 4 3 iodo 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine L 634,340 or l methyl 4 3 bromo 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine L 636,524 , 80 of the mice failed to exhibit the typical signs normally elicited by amphetamine.A reference neuroleptic, chlorpromazine, also antagonized the action of amphetamine Table 1 . II. Antiavoidance Activity in Squirrel Monkeys Methods Squirrel monkeys Saimiri sciureus of both sexes were trained to press a lever in order to avoid an electric shock. The animals were trained and tested while restrained in a chair in an isolation chamber. The electric shock 600 V a.c., 2 mA, 1 second was given via leads placed on the seat of the chair and a ring around the animal s neck. Background noise was supplied with a Grason Stadler Noise Generator. A modifiedSidman avoidance schedule RS 36 SS 36 was used, programming 36 seconds of shock free time after each lever press avoidance response . A lever press made during a shock escape response immediately terminated the shock, resetting the shock shock interval timer to 36 seconds.The avoidance schedule also contained an alarm system to shut off the schedule for 30 minutes, if an animal received 10 consecutive shocks without a lever press. This prevented the animals from receiving an excessive number of shocks.Following the 30 minute alarm period, the schedule resumed again. An animal was assigned the maximum number of shocks 50 30 minutes , if the alarm system was activated during a trial. The test compounds were administered by gavage at cumulative doses of 0.33, 1 and 3 mg. kg. given at 0, 90 and 180 minutes of the test session. Results l methyl 4 3 iodo 5H dibenzo a,d cyclohepten 5 ylidene piperidine L 634,340 caused the monkeys to take a large number of shocks, i.e.avoidance responding was markedly depressed Table 2 .Chlorpromazine, a reference standard, also exhibits a similar action in this test procedure.
