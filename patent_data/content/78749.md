# Reinforced and chemically resistant optical filament.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved optical filament waveguide providing increased strength and resistance to moisture and chemical attack. This improved optical filament waveguide is particularly useful in the severe environment encountered in wellbore logging operations. This optical filament waveguide is the result of coating, preferably at a temperature below 500 C, an optical fila ment rod with a relatively thin protective coating of a metal oxide whose coefficient of thermal expansion is of the same order of magnitude as that of the rod.
