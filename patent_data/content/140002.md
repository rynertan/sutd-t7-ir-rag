# TEMPERATURE COMPENSATED ORIENTATION OF BERLINITE FOR SURFACE ACOUSTIC WAVE DEVICES

## Abstract
A piezoelectric wafer of single crystal berlinite, having a surface defined by an X axis boule cut at about 85 , provides an improved substrate for a surface acoustic wave device. The 85 cut angle is relatively easy to fabricate, provides excellent temperature compensation in a range from 20 C to 100 C, and has high piezoelectric coupling coefficient.
