## Abstract
A transducer 10 for indicating changes of an applied physical force F includes a first means 18 connected within an electrical circuit 20, 22 so that an electrical po tential difference is always connected across the first means. A second means 24 is capable of electrically cou pling with the first means 18 in a manner so as to reflect a linear relationship between the area of coupling between the two means and the force F applied to the second means 24 . The coupling may be resistive, capacitive or in ductive in nature. An elastomeric actuator 28 may be pro vided. The fact that current can flow through the first means 18 , even when it is not electrically coupled with the second means 24 , allows the zero position of an indicator dot driv en by the transducer to be readily adjusted.
