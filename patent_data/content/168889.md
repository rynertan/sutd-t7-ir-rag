## Description
DISPERSIBLE FABRIC SOFTENERS Technical Field The present invention relates to means of treating fibers and fabrics, wherein a sub stoichiometric complex of amines and phosphate esters is used to provide softness and anti static benefits. Detergent compositions containing said amine phosphate ester softeners are disclosed. The compositions herein can be used to soften fabrics. Background The use of softeners to treat fabrics after a washing operation is a well known laundering practice. Fabric softeners are, in the main, water insoluble cationic materials that are incompatible with anionic detersive surfactants used in most fabric washing compositions. For that reason, the softening operation is generally carried out in the laundry rinse bath after the surfactant has been removed from the washing machine.This entails additional work for the user. Formulators of fabric laundering compositions have long sought means whereby fabric washing and softening could be done concurrently. Laundering methods employing clay softeners, mixtures of clays and various amine materials and the like, are described in the following patents German 29 64114.3, 28 57163.3, 24 39541.3, 23 34899.4 and EPO 80200570.2, 80200877.1 and 80201015.7.The use of mixtures of amines and soaps salt of fatty acids as through the wash softeners is disclosed in U.K.Patent 1.514.276. The prior art also discribes the use of various cationic materials in sheet form. See U.S. Patent 4.220.562. The prior art also teaches the softener use of alkyl phosphonate and quaternary ammonium compounds. EPOApplication 0 006 268, filed June 11, 1979. The prior art also teaches various mixtures of phosphate esters in detergents with fabric softening action BE 802,679. The present invention employs amine phosphate ester softeners in laundry compositions to provide cleaning and softening concurrently The softeners herein provide softening and anti static benefits, especially when used with clay softeners. Importantly, the use of phosphate esters in sub stoichiometric quantities with the amines in the manner disclosed herein advantageously enhances deposition of the amines on fabrics by as much as 1.5 or 2 fold, as compared with prior art amine fabric softening compositions. Summary of the Invention The present invention encompasses a method for softening fabrics by contacting same with sub stoichiometric, water insoluble, water dispersible complexes of amine and phosphate ester as described more fully, hereinafter in the presence of water. The method can be carried out, for example, by tumbling damp fabrics with said complexes in a hot air clothes dryer. In another mode, said complexes can be used in an aqueous rinse bath, for example in a laundry rinse. In still another mode, the method can be carried out concurrently with a fabric cleansing treatment, for example in a detergent containing laundry liquor, to soften fabrics. The invention also encompasses detergent compositions preferably granular which may be described succinctly as containing conventional detergent ingredients such as detersive surfactants including anionics , detergency builders, optical brighteners, detersive enzymes, fabric bleaches, and the like, all at rather conventional levels, as well as clay fabric softeners preferably, smectite clays , said compositions being characterized in that they contain at least 0.1 preferably 1.0 to 15 of the aforesaid sub stoichiometric, water insoluble, water dispersible amine phosphate ester softeners. The most preferred compositions with clay are formulated to contain not more than 5 preferably not more than 1 2 of a nonionic detersive surfactant. The invention also encompasses an article for use in a laundry bath or rinse bath, or in a laundry dryer, comprising the aforesaid sub stoichiometric amine phosphate ester softeners releasably affixed to a water insoluble carrier, for example, a sheet of paper or fabric. Such compositions are optionally formulated to contain a bleach activator and such activator containing compositions are especially useful in laundry baths. The ingredients and means for preparing the compositions are disclosed more fully hereinafter. All weights and proportions are by weight, unless otherwise specified. Detailed Description of the Invention As noted hereinafter, the compositions of this invention comprise, in major part, conventional ingredients that are quite familiar to formulators of laundry compositions. One of the major advantages of the amine phosphate softeners used herein is that they are entirely compatible with such conventional laundry ingredients, used at conventional concentrations.Amines The amines employed herein are of the formulaR1R2R3N where R1 is C6 to C20, R2 is C1 toC20 or hydrogen, and R3 is C1 to C10 or hydrogen. Preferably, the amines have both R1 and R2 asC6 C20 alkyl, with C16 C18 being most preferred, and with R3 as C1 C3 alkyl. Mixed amines, such as dicoconutalkyl and ditallowalkyl methyl amines can be used. Such materials are commercially available underTrade Marks such as Armeen .Phosphate Ester The phosphate esters which are critical to the practice of this invention are commercially available materials of the general formulae EMI4.1 wherein R and R are C1 C20 alkyl or preferably ethoxylated alkyl groups of the general formulae alkyl OCH2CH2 y, wherein the alkyl substituent is C1 C20, CZO preferably C C16 and Y is an integer of 1 C 8 16 to 15, preferably 2 10, most preferably 2 5. Such compounds are prepared by known methods from phosphorus pentoxide, phosphoric acid or phosphorus oxy halide and alcohols or ethoxylated alcohols. It will be appreciated that the formulae depicted represent mono and di esters, and commercial phosphate esters will generally comprise mixtures of the mono and di esters, together with some proportion of tri ester.Typical commercial esters are available under the TradeMarks Phospholan PDB3 Diamond Shamrock and Servoxyl VPAZ Servo . Amine PhosPhate Ester Softeners The prior art describes various phosphate ester amine compounds see U.S. Patent 3.364.192 some of which have been disclosed for use as fiber finishing agents see U.S. Patents 3.434.874 3.428.481 and 3.560.382. However, the prior art compositions generally involve 1 1 mole basis compounds or complexes, i.e., compounds or complexes from stoichiometric mixtures. Surprisingly, such stoichiometric complexes are of no use in the present invention, apparently because they form unstable dispersions prone to aggregation. In contrast, the sub stoichiometric mixtures herein are extremely well dispersed in water, but are not water soluble. While not intending to be limited by theory, it is instructive to consider the physico chemical behaviour of the amine phosphate ester softeners herein, inasmuch as this can be of assistance to the formulator. It will be appreciated that the amines used herein and in art disclosed compositions exist in aqueous solutions as fairly coarse particles, or oily globules, having a spectrum of sizes. It appears that attachment of such particles to fabrics to provide the desired softening action can be considerably enhanced by reduction of their average size coarser material being rinsed away by mechanical action. On the other hand, complete solubilization or micellization is to be avoided since this also leads to inadequate attachment of the amine to fabrics. In addition to size of the dispersed amine particles.their phase structure is of importance since this will influence their effective spreading after attachment to fiber or fabric surfaces. Phase structure influences also the stability of amine dispersions. Consideration of these factors apparently explains why. on one hand, amines untreated with phosphate ester and on the other hand, stoichiometric amine ester complexes are of very low effectiveness relative to the sub stoichiometric mixtures of amine phosphate ester now disclosed. It has now been discovered that sub stoichiometric mixtures of amine phosphate ester exist as aqueous dispersions whose particles readily deposit on, spread on, and soften, fibers and fabrics. By sub stoichiometric herein is meant that there is an excess of amine relative to phosphate ester. In general, there are at least about two parts amine on a weight basis per one part weight of phosphate ester, but this will, of course, vary with the molecular weights of the amine and ester, respectively. The objective is to have a readily dispersible in water mixture, but not one that is water soluble. Useful amine phosphate esters can easily be observed by a simple test. The amines herein, suspended in water, form a generally greasy appearing, non homogeneous mixture. By contrast, the sub stoichiometric amine phosphate ester mixtures used in this invention form stable milky suspensions in water. Laboratory estimates of the particle sizes of these suspensions indicate that 60 to 80 of the particles fall within the size range of .1 to 8 micrometers 20 to 40 within the range 8 to 20 micrometers and essentially all the particles are below 40 micrometers in diameter. For the preferred sub stoichiometric amine phosphate ester softeners herein, the weight ratio of amine phosphate ester is above 5 1, generally 7 1 to 15 1, most preferably 10 1. Again, such softeners are selected to be water dispersible, not water soluble. In general terms, the amine phosphate ester softeners are prepared separately from the balance of the compositions, and are preferably then added to the other, conventional ingredients to provide the final formulations. This can most conveniently be done by preparing a melt of the phosphate ester and the amine and maintaining the melt stage for a few minutes. The melt can then be layered onto a sheet substrate to prepare, for example, a dryer added fabric softener. To prepare a detergent, the melt can be solidified and comminuted to the desired particles size e.g., in an extruder , and dry mixed with a granular detergent composition. The melt may also be sprayed onto detergent granules. The melt may also be dispersed into a stirred, aqueous crutcher mix comprising the balance of the detersive ingredients, and spray dried in standard fashion.This crutcher addition is less preferred, as it leads to some decomposition of the complex. Simply adding the amine and phospate ester, individually, to a detergent crutcher mix does not secure the intended benefits of this invention. An especially preferred softener herein is prepared by melting together ten parts by weight of di C12 C14 alkyl monomethyl amine and one part by weight of a mono C12 C14 EO 15j ester of phosphoric acid, sold under the Trade Mark Servoxyl VPAZ s. The amine phosphate ester softeners will generally be used at levels of at least 0.1 , preferably 1 to 15 , in detergent compositions at levels of at least 1 , preferably 1 to 25 in rinse added fabric softeners and at levels of 2 to 60 in dryer and wash machine added sheets where the balance of the composition mainly comprises the weight of the sheet substrate .Softener Clay The above disclosed amine phosphate ester softeners are preferably used in granular detergent compsitions, where they are most preferably used in combination with a detergent compatible clay fabric softener. Such clay softeners are well known in the detergency patent literature and are in broad commercial use, both in Europe and in the United States. Included among such clay softeners are various heat treated kaolins and various multi layer smectites. Preferred clay softeners are smectite softener clays that are described in German patent document 23 34 899 and in U.K. Patent 1.400.898 which can be referred to for details. Softener clays are used in the preferred compositions at levels of at least 1 , generally 1 20 , preferably 2 7 .Detersive Surfactants The detergent compositions of this invention will contain organic surface active agents surfactants to provide the usual cleaning benefits associated with the use of such materials. Detersive surfactant useful herein include well known synthetic anionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surfactants. Typical of these are the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl and alkylether sulfates, paraffin sulfonates, olefin sulfonates, amine oxides, a sulfonates of fatty acids and of fatty acid esters, and the like, which are well known from the detergency art. In general, such detersive surfactants contain an alkyl group in the Cg Cl8 range the anionic detersive surfactants can be used in the form of their sodium, potassium or triethanolammonium salts. U.S. Patent 4.111.855 contains detailed listings of such typical detersive surfactants. C11 C16 alkyl benzene sulfonates, C12 C18 paraffin sulfonates and alkyl sulfates are especially preferred in the compositions of the present type. Also useful herein as the surfactant are the water soluble soaps, e.g. the common sodium and potassium coconut or tallow soaps well known in the art. It is to be understood that the use of typical alkoxylated nonionic surfactants e.g. the C C9 C18 alkyl alcohols and alkyl phenols with 5 to 20 ethoxyl groups are preferably limited in the practice of this invention to levels of not more than about 5 , preferably not more than 2 , most preferably 0 1 , of the compositions when clay is present as a co softener, since alkoxylates can interfere with the softening properties of clay. In clay free compositions, the alkoxylated nonionics can be used at any desired level. The surfactant component can comprise as little as 1 of the laundry detergent compositions herein, but generally the compositions will contain 5 to 40 , preferably 6 to 30 , of surfactant. Mixtures of the anionics, such as the alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and paraffin sulfonates are preferred for through the wash cleansing of a broad spectrum of soils and stains from fabric.Detersive Adjuncts The compositions herein can contain other ingredients which aid in their cleaning performance. For example, it is highly preferred that through the wash detergent compositions contain a detergent builder and or metal ion sequestrant. Compounds classifiable and well known in the art as detergent builders include the nitrilotriacetates, polycarboxylates, citrates, water soluble phosphates such as tri polyphosphate and sodium ortho and pyro phosphates, silicates, and mixtures thereof. Metal ion sequestrants include all of the above, plus materials like ethylene diaminetetraacetate, the amino polyphosphonates and phosphates DEQUEST and a wide variety of other poly functional organic acids and salts too numerous to mention in detail here. See U.S. Patent 3.579.454 for typical examples of the use of such materials in various cleaning compositions.In general, the builder sequestrant will comprise 0.5 to 45 of the composition. The 1 10 micrometer size zeolite e.g.zeolite A builders disclosed in German Patent 24 22 655 are especially preferred for use in low phosphate compositions which contain the softeners described herein. The laundry compositions herein also preferably contain enzymes to enhance their through the wash cleaning performance on a variety of soils and stains. Amylase and protease enzymes suitable for use in detergents are well known in the art and in commercially available liquid and granular detergents. Commercial detersive enzymes preferably a mixture of amylase and protease are typically used at levels of 0.001 to 2 , and higher, in the present compositions. Moreover, the compositions herein can contain, in addition to ingredients already mentioned, various other optional ingredients typically used in commercial products to provide aesthetic or additional product performance benefits. Typical ingredients include pH regulants, perfumes, dyes, bleaches, optical brighteners, soil suspending agents, hydrotropes and gel control agents, freeze thaw stabilizers, bactericides, preservatives, suds control agents, bleach activators and the like. The compositions can further contain a peroxygen bleach activator, particularly tetraacetyl ethylenediamine TAED , typically from 0.1 to 5 , preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 . Other highly desirable detergent ingredients for use in the detergent compositions of the present invention are quaternary ammonium compounds of the formR4R3R6R7N wherein R4 is alkyl having from 10 to 20, preferably from 12 18 carbon atoms, andR5,R6 and R7 are each C1 to C4 alkyl preferably methyl X is an anion, e.g. chloride. Examples of such quaternary ammonium compounds include monotallowalkyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and mono cocoalkyl trimethyl ammonium methosulfate. The quaternary ammonium compounds can be used at levels from 0.5 to 5 , preferably from 1 to 3 .Detergent compositions containing both TAED and the mono long chain alkyl tri short chain alkyl ammonium compound are highly preferred. In a through the wash laundry mode, the compositions are typically used at a concentration of at least 500 ppm, preferably 0.10 to 2.5 , in an aqueous laundry bath at pH 7 11 to launder fabrics. The laundering can be carried out over the range from 5 C to the boil, with excellent results. In an alternate mode, the amine phosphate ester softeners herein may be releasably adsorbed or releasably coated onto a non particulate substrate such as a non woven or paper sheet or flexible sponge mat, or the like. Such sheet form objects may be added to the laundry or rinse bath, or to the laundry dryer, where the softener is released to provide fabric softening. In an alternate, and highly preferred, mode the amine phosphate ester softener is used in sheet form in combination with a bleach activator such as tetraacetyl ethylene diamine or a straight or branched chain C6 C10 oxybenzene sulfonate as a combined perborate activator and softener in a laundry liquor. See, for example U.S. Patent.4.220.562. Such sheet form products will generally employ 1 20 grams of the amine phosphate ester softener and 1 20 grams of the bleach activator. In still another mode, the amine phosphate ester can be formulated as a liquid fabric softener and used in a post laundry rinse bath. Such liquid softeners can comprise, for example, a simple dispersion of the amine phosphate ester softener in water or water alcohol. It is to be understood that the compositions and processes of this invention are carried out in a manner that will, typically, deposit at least a few milligrams generally, at least 1 1000 mg of the sub stoichiometric amine phosphate ester softener per square meter on the fabric being treated, as will be seen in the following examples. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION The following examples are typical of the preferred compositions of this invention, but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.
