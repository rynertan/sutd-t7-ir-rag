# Electronically controlled fuel injection based on minimum time control for diesel engines.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electronically controlled fuel injection system for controlling a fuel quantity to be injected each cylinder of a diesel engine by a fuel injection pump 5 , wherein a positioning servo system is employed which is arranged to calculate a control input value of an actuator 82 in accordance with a signal from an actual position sensor 84 and a signal from a fuel quantity control unit 2 so that the actual position of a fuel adjustment member 83 is coincident with a desired position thereof indicated by the signal from the control unit 2 . The servo system comprises a minimum time control unit 7 and a speed estimation unit 9 . The minimum time control unit 7 derives the control input value from a map established on the basis of the nonlinear dynamic model of the actuator 82 as a function of a deviation between the actual and desired positions, a current passing through the actuator 82 and a speed of the fuel adjustment member estimated by the speed estimation unit 9 .
