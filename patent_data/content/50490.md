# Sterile pack.

## Abstract
A sterile pack comprising, in combination, a moulded plastics container 1 to which is attached a moulded plastics cap 20 , the container being integrally sealed at its upper end, the neck of the container being provided with thread 3 , an an nular portion 10 of the neck above the thread being frangible, and the cap having a thread complementary with the container thread and means for contacting the container above the said annular portion, is characterised in that the thread 3 has a pitch of between 0.05 and 0.095 turns per millimeter per mil limeter of thread diameter, and that the diameter of the frangi ble portion 10 of the container is at most 80 of the thread di ameter. The container is opened by screwing the cap further onto the container, so that the container contacting part of the cap above the frangible portion causes relative movement between the top of the container and the remainder thereof, thus break ing the frangible portion of the container, and then unscrewing the cap, in the normal way, to remove the sheared off upper part of the container from the rest of the container, and expose the contents of the container.
