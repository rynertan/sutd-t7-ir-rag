# Flame monitoring system.

## Abstract
In a multi burner boiler or industrial furnace installation that uses pulverized coal for fuel and utilizes an oil pilot torch it has been difficult to sense and discriminate satisfactorily between safe and unsafe burner operation in this multi burner arrangement. By using both a Si detector 10 visible light responsive and a lead sulfide detector 1 infrared responsive and selectively conmining the signals therefrom, the best characteristics of both detectors are utilized to provide satisfactory flame sensing.
