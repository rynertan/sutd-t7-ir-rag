# A process for preparing overcoated electrophotographic imaging members.

## Abstract
A process for forming an overcoated electrophotographic imaging member by applying a coating of a cross linkable siloxanol colloidal silica hybrid material on an electrophoto graphic imaging member and thereafter contacting the coating with a fugitive ammonia gas condensation catalyst until the siloxanol colloidal silica hybrid material forms a cross linked solid layer. The cross linkable siloxanol collaidal silica hybrid material may be prepared by hydrolyzing trifunctional organo silanes and stabilizing the hydrolyzed silanes with collidal silica. The electrophotographic imaging member may comprise inorganic or organic photoconductive components in one or more layers.
