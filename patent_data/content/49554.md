# Substituted pyridinesulfonylisocyanates and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Substituted pyridinesulfonylisocyanates of the formula CHEM wherein R1 is halogen, CH3, NO2 or alkoxycarbonyl are valuable intermeidates for the preparation of herbicidal pyridinesulfonylurea derivatives. They may be prepared by reacting a corresponding R1 substituted N alkylaminocarbonyl pyridinesulfonamide with phosgene.
