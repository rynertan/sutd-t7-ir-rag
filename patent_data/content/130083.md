# ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC TONING SYSTEM

## Abstract
The present invention discloses a diode bias toning sys tem for use in and with electrophotographic copying machines and the like, and provides a significant improve ment over floating and hard wired toning systems to provide a user with the benefit of self compensation or self adjustment sensitometry, while allowing better control of large density percentage images and providing a simple prac tical means and method which yield the satisfactory inherent results or advantages of a hard wired system. The emp loyment of a single diode means connected between a development electrode and a high voltage D.C. power supply, so as to prevent the passage of current between the develop ment electrode and the supply means, thereby facilitates the usage of a single high voltage D.C. power supply to supply both the corona charging and toning biasing functions of an electrophotographic copying machine or system.
