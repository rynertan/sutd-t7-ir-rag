## Abstract
A unit for heat fixing xerographic images makes use of a fuser roller and a self adjusting pressure roller. The fuser roller is internally heated and it may be associated with a self adjusting cleaning roller. The preceeding elements may form a unit which can be provided moreover with scraper elements and supplementary feeding rollers located downstream of the fuser and fusing rollers and which rotate at a peripheral speed exceeding that of the latters.
