# Lifting gear and testing it.

## Abstract
A lifting attachment for lifting a heavy load comprises a generally cylindrical member 7, 30 which may be a post passing through a hole in the load, or a sleeve fitting over a post 6 fixed to the load. To retain a lifting sling, the member 7, 30 has a radially projecting retaining flange 8 , that extends circumferentially at least partly around it the flange 8 has a curved shape with wings 12 curving upwardly from its lowermost portion, so that an increasing amount of the flange 8 contacts the sling as the angle of approach of the sling to the sleeve becomes more acute. The flange 8 and member 7, 30 may be a re usable one piece casting. Apparatus is also provided for test loading the lifting attach ment.
