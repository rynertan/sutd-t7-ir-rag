# DC AC converter for the ignition and the supply with alternating current of a gas and or vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a DC AC converter provided with two transistors 11 and 20 , the current through an inductive ly stabilized discharge lamp 16, 15 to be connected to the converter alternately flowing through one and the other transistor. According to the invention, the lamp 15 has connected in series with it a primary winding 12 of a current transformer, a secondary winding 30, 31 of this transformer being connected to a timing circuit 32 to 35 32 to 35 of a control device of the transistors. The timing circuit is provided with voltage dependent elements, i.e. Zener diodes 35, 35 . The combination of the current transformer and the Zener diodes causes the frequency of the converter during a starting of the lamp 15 to be larger than during the operating condition of this lamp. As a result, it is avoided that this lamp ignites at too cold electrodes.
