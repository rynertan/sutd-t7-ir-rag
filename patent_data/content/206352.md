Field of the Invention The present invention relates te coding trarmission equipment in which an input signal, such as a voice signal or a picture signal, is coded and transmitted to a receiver side from a transmitter side and a received signal is decoded to become an original signal at the receiver side. In particular, the present invention relates to low bit rate coding equipment bandwidth compression coding equipment , such as anADPCM Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation system CODEC COder and DECoder , which carries out low bit rate coding of a voice or picture signal. When the voice signal etc., is transmitted, bandwidth compression is required to ensure an efficient utilization of a transmission line. The low bit rate coding transmission equipment for the voice signal carries out information compression while maintaining the quality of the voice signal, which enables a reduction of line costs for the transmission of the voice information in equipment used for , for example, mobile radio communication, satellite communication, or office inter communication system, and a reduction of storage capacity needed, for example, for the storage of voice information in an audio response system. 2. Description of the Related Art ADPCM coding equipment is related to the present invention in that it carries out coding by adaptive quantization. In the ADPCM coding equipment, a prediction error E corresponding to a difference between a current input signal X and a predicted value X obtained on the basis of past input signals is produced and quantized at the transmitter side. At this time, adaptive quantization, in which the size of a quantizing step is increased or decreased in accordance with a quantizing level of a signal sampled just prior to the current sampled signal, is carried out in order to realize a quick adaptation to a sudden change of the predicted error, instead of uniform quantlzation, whereby a high quality recovered signal is realized. In this case, however, the sizes to which the quantizing step can increased or decreased are limited, and therefore, when the input signals are voice sIgnals, for example, a voiced sound, an unvoiced sound, or a voicelessness, etc., the nature of the signals changes from moment to moment and the coding system of the prior art cannot cope with these rapid variations in the voice signal. As a result, an optimum quantization is not realized, and thus the voice recovered at the receiver side has a poor quality. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide coding transmission equipment which can obtain a high quality recovered signal, for example, a voice signal recovered at a receiver side. According to a fundamental aspect of the present invention, there is provided coding transmission equipment having a transmitter device and a receiver device wherein, the transmitter device comprises a plurality of adaptive coding units including an adaptive quantizer for outputting a quantized value according to an input signal, and an error calculating unit for calculating the quantization error of the adaptive quantizer, each of the adaptive coding units having different adaptive quantizer processing characteristics an evaluating unit for deciding which is the optimum adaptive coding unit to carry out an optimum quantization, from among the plurality of adaptive coding units, at every frame of the input signal on the basis of the quantization errors input from the plurality of adaptive coding units respectively and a sending unit for selecting the optimum quantized value of the optimum adaptive coding unit from among the quantized values input from the plurality of adaptive coding units, respectively, on the basis of the decision of the evaluating unit, and transmitting the optimum quantized value together with the decision information the receiver device comprises a dividing unit for dividing a signal received from the transmitter device into the optimum quantized value and the decision information an adaptive decoding unit for decoding the optimum quantized value obtained by the dividing unit into the original input signal and an optimum controlling unit for controlling the processing characteristic of the adaptive decoding unit to an optimum processing characteristic according to the decision information obtained by the dividing unit. According to another aspect of the present invention, the transmitter device further comprises a parameter copy unit in which parameters for determining an inner condition of the adaptive coding unit are input from all of the adaptive coding units, and an optimum parameter of the optimum adaptive coding unit is selected and sent to other adaptive coding units at every frame according to the decision of the evaluating unit wherein each of the other adaptive coding units starts the signal process for a next frame after copying the optimum parameter sent from the parameter copy unit, as an own parameter. According to still another aspect of the present invention, the transmitter device further comprises an error correction coding unit for carrying out an error correction coding process for the decision information from the evaluating unit, whereby the decision information processed by the error correction coding is sent to the receiver device and the receiver device further comprises an error correcting unit for carrying out the error correcting process for the decision information obtained by the dividing unit, whereby the error corrected decision information is sent to the opt mum controlling unit. According to yet ancther aspect of the present invention the receiver device further comprises a post processing filter disposed at a latter stage of te adaptive decoding unit, wherein the parameter o the post processing filter is varied according to the parameter o the adaptive decoding unit.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For a better understanding of the preferred embodiment, the problems in the prior art will be first explained with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows an adaptive differential coder on the transmitter side in a prior art low bit rate coding transmission equipment for a voice signal. In Fig. 1, the coder comprises a subtractor 10 for calculating a prediction error E n corresponding to a difference between an input voice signal X n and a predicted valueX n to be output an adaptive quantizer 11 for adaptive quantizing of the prediction error E n to output the quantized value I n as a transmission signal an adaptive inverse quantizer 12 for adaptive inverse quantizing of the quantized value I n an adder 13 for adding the inverse quantized value Ê n of the prediction error E n from the inverse quantizer 12 and the predicted value X n an adaptive zero predictor 14 for producing a zero predicted value X n z an adaptive pole predictor 15 for producing a pole predicted value X n p and an adder 16 for adding the zero predicted value A value X n z and the pole predicted value X n P to p produce the predicted value X n . In this adaptive differential coder, the quantizer 11, the inverse quantizer 12, the zero predictor 14, and the pole predictor 15 are adaptivecontrolled. For example, in the quantizer 11 and the inverse quantizer 12, the adaptive quantization wherein the quantizing step size A n is updated according to the following formula is carried out. A n l A n x M I n ... 1 where, y is a coefficient for gradually reducing the influence of the line error, which has a value close to and lower than 1 and M I n is a step size updating coefficient or a step size updating speed . When the quantized value I n from the quantizer 11 is, for example, a 1 bit output signal, the updating coefficient M I n assumes a value close to and lower than 1, for example, a 0.93, when the uantize valueI n is 0 , and a value Q close to and higher than 1, for example, ss 1.31, when the quantIzed value 1 n is II lit.Also, when the quantized value 1 n is a plurality bit output signal, the step size updating coefficient M I n is increased in proportion to the increment of the number indicated by the plurality bit output signal. Figure 2 shows an adaptive differential decoder on the receiver side in a prior art low bit rate coding transmission equipment. In Fig. 2, the decoder comprises an inverse quantizer 711, an adder 73, a zero predictor 75, a pole predictor 76, and an adder 77. In this decoder, the quantized value I n of the prediction error transmitted from the transmitter side is inverse quantized by the inverse quantizer 71 to recover the prediction error, and the zero predicted A value X n z and the pole predicted value X n are p produced by the zero predictor 75 and the pole predictor 76 on the basis of the recovered past prediction errors respectively. Then, the predicted value X n obtained by adding this zero predicted value A X n z and the pole predicted value X n bv the p adder 73 is added to the inverse quantized prediction error from the inverse quantizer 71 by the adder 73, to recover the voice signal S n .The processing characteristics of the inverse quantizer 71 , the zero predictor 75, and the pole predictor 76 at the receiver side are the same as that of the inverse quantizer 12, the zero predictor 14, and the pole predictor 15 at the transmitter side, respectively. In the differential coder of Fig. I, the step size updating coefficient M I n of the quantizer 11 and the inverse quantizer 12 is a fixed value, since the values a and 3 which determine the updating coefficient M I n are fixed. Therefore, sometimes the optimum quantization is not carred out at the quantizer 11, since updating coefficient M I n of the step size A n , which is a threshold for cuantizing the prediction error E n , may not sufficiently follow the change of the prediction error E n . In particular, when the input signal is a voice signal, the nature of the signal, for example, a voiced sound, unvoiced sound, or silence, changes from moment to moment and frequently varies, and therefore, the optimum quantization is not carried out since the fixed step size updating coefficient M I n cannot follow the change of the voice signal. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to Figs. 3 to 5.Figures 3 to 5 show a embodiment of the coding transmission equipment, according to the present invention, which is adapted to transmission equipment using theADPCM coding system. Figure 3 shows an ADPCM coder at the transmitter side, and Fig. 4 shows an ADPCM decoder at the receiver side. In Fig. 3, 11 to lk are the k numbers of adaptive differential coding units in which the step size updating coefficients M I n l to M I n k of quantizers in more detail, values a and ss described above are different, respectively. The fundamental structure is the same as the adaptive differential coder shown inFig. 1, except that a subtractor is provided which calculates and outputs a quantization error e n corresponding to a differential value between the prediction A error E n and the inverse quantized value E n of the prediction error E n from the inverse quantizer 12. Figure 5 shows a more detailed structure of one of the adaptive differential coding units Ii to lk. In Fig. 5, the subtractor 10 calculates the prediction error E n corresponding to the differential value between the input voice sisal X n and the predicted value X n and sends this prediction error E n to the adaptive quantlzer 11. The adaot ve tizer II quantizes the prediction error E n and outputs a quantized value I n . This quantized value I n is introduced to the inverse a.uantizer 12, which carries out the inverse quantization.At the same time, the quantized value 1 n is transmitted te the receiver A side. The inverse quantLzed value E n of the prediction error E n from the inverse quantizer 12 is introduced to the zero predictor 14 and the subtractor 17, and to the pole predictcr 15 via the adder 13. The zero predictor 14 produces a zero predicted value X n z , and the pole predictor 15 produces a pole predicted A A value X n . The zero predicted value X n z and the p A pole predicted value X n are added by the adder 16 P A to produce a predicted value X n , which is then sent to the subtractor 10.The subtractor 17 calculates the differential value between the prediction error E n and A the inverse quantized value E n thereof, and outputs the result as a quantization error e n . The quantizer II and the inverse quantizer 12 are adaptive controlled type devices, and the quantizing step size A n is updated by the quantizing step adapter not shown according to the formula I described previously. This quantizing step size a n is a parameter for deciding inner conditions of the quantizer 11 and the inverse quantizer 12. The zero predictor 14 and the pole predictor 15 are also adaptive control type devices, and are constituted by circuits comprising taps time delay elements and coefficient multipliers, having the orders g and m, respectively. The zero predictor 14 and the pole predictor 15 hold prediction coefficients updated in sequence, and from the viewpoint of the transfer function as a filter, hold tap data containing past records. That is, in the zero predictor 14, zero prediction coefficients Cz l, n X Cz Q, n of each coefficient multIplier are updated by the prediction coef cient adapter not shown according to the following formula, respectively. Czfi, n l Lz x Cz i, n Dz x sgn Ê n x sgn Ê n i ... 2 where, Lz and Dz are constant, and sgn is a signature function which indicates a signature of or . The zero prediction coefficients Cz l, n to CzíQ, n and tap datas E n l to E n g stored at each tap are parameters for determining the inner condition cf the zero predictor 14. Also, in the pole predictor 15, pole prediction coefficients Cp l, n to Cp m, n of each coefficient multiplier are updated by the prediction coefficient adapter not shown according to the following formula, respectively. C i, n l L x C i, n p p p D x sgn E n x sgn S n i ... 3 p where, L and D are constant. p p The pole prediction coefficients C 1, n to A A P Cp m, n and tap data S n l to S n m stored at each tap are the parameters for determining the inner condition of the pole predictor 15. In Fig. 3, each component of Fig. 5 is represented in such a manner that the quantizer 11 is represented byQ1 to Qk , the inverse quantizer 12 by Q1 1 to Qk 1, the zero predictor 14 by Hzl to Hzk , and the pole predictor 15 by Hpl to Kpk , respectively. In Fig. 3 quantization errors e n l to e n k are introduced to an evaluating unit 2. The evaluating unit 2 comprises a quantization error power calculating unit 21 and an optimum quantization deciding unit 22.The calculating unit 21 calculates powers of the quantlzation errors e n to e n k , sample bv sample respectively, during one frame of the voice signal X n for example, 16 samples , and integrates them, respec vely, at each frame, then outputs the summer powers of each of the quantization errors etn to e njk at the end of the frame to the deciding unit 22.The deciding unit 22 decides the optimum coding unit I opt, which caries out the cpt mum quantization, among the adaptive differential coding units 11 to lk , by selecting the minimum calculated quantization error power from that of the quantization errors e n to e n k Then, the deciding unit 22 outputs an optimum coder number signal Ncpt, indicating the number of the optimum coding unit 1 opt decided as aforementioned, to a selector 3 and a multiplexer 4. The quantized values I n l to I n k from adaptive differential coding units 11 to lk are introduced to the selector 3, respectively. This selector is constituted by a memory such as a RAM, which can store quantized values I n l to I n of one frame. When the coder number signal Nopt is received at the end of one frame, the selector 3 sends one frame of the optimum quantized value I nl of the optimum coding unit opt I opt, which is selected by using the coder number signal Nopt, as an address to the multiplexer 4. The multiplexer 4 adds the coder number signal Nopt from the evaluating unit to the optimum quantized value I n opt, and transmits a multiplexed signal to the receiver side after converting the signal to a transmission line code. In the receiver of Fig 4, 6 is a demultiplexer, and 7 a decoder. The decoder 7 comprises an adaptive inverse quantizer 71 a controller 72 capable of controlling the step size updating coefficient M I n of the inverse quantizer 71 an adaptive predictor 74 constituted by a zero predictor 75, a pole predictor 76, and an adder 77 and an adder 73. The operation of the above described coding trans mission equipment is explained hereinafter. The voice signal X n is input to each of adaptive di eretial coding units 11 to lk in parallel, an adaptve i e ent al co ina process is carried out at each unit, and the quantized values I n l to and the quantizaticn errors e n l to e n k are output.The quantization error power calculatIng unit 21 calculates the power of the input quantization errors e n l , to e n k frame by frame, respectively, then sends the calculated results to the optimum quantization deciding unit 22. The deciding unit 22 decides the optimum coding unit 1 opt for outputting the quantization error e n , having a minimum quantization error power, which carries out the optimum quantization and then sends the coder number signal Nopt indicating the coder number of the decided optimum coding unit 1 opt to the selector 3 and the multiplexer 4. In response to this coder number signal Nopt, the selector 3 sends one frame of the optimum quantized value I n opt of the optimum coding unit lcpt indicated by the coder number signal Nopt to the multiplexer 4.The multiplexer 4 adds the coder number signal Nopt to the optimum quantized value I n opt and transmits the multiplexed signal to the receiver side. In the receiver side, the received signal is divided into the quantized value I n opt of the prediction errorE n and the coder number signal Nopt, and input to the inverse quantizer 71 and the controller 72, respectively.The inverse quantizer 71 inverse quantizes the quantized value I n opt to obtain the original prediction error Ê n , then sends the prediction error Ê n to the adder 73. The adder 73 adds the inverse quantized prediction A A error E n and the predicted value X n predicted by the predictor 74 on the basis of past recovered voice signals to recover the current voice signal S n . The predictor 74 carries out the adaptive prediction according to the output signal of the inverse quantizer 71. On the other hand, the controller 72 controls the step size updating coefficient M I n of the inverse quantizer 71 to coincide wIth the step slze updating coeficin I n opt of the optimum coding unit I opt selected as the coding unit carrying out the optimum quantizatlon for a reliant frame at the transmitter side.That is, the controller 72 reads out the stet size updating coefficient M I n from a ROM by using the coder number signal Nopt as an address, then senas it to the inverse quantlzer 71, and an inverse quantization step adapter in the inverse ciuantizer 71 changes the updating coefficient M I n . As described above, in the coding transmission equipment of the present invention, the coder of the transmitter side selects the optimum coding unit which carries out the optimum quantization from among a plurality of adaptive differential coding units having different step size updating coefficients, then transmits the quantized value thereof with the coding unit number, and the decoder of the receiver side recovers the original voice signal from the received quantized value by using the optimum step size updating coefficient indicated by the received coding unit number, whereby an improvement of the quantity of the recovered voice signal is achieved. Although a preferred embodiment has been described heretofore, various modifications and alterations are possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, means for changing the optimum updating coefficient M I n in accordance with the received coder number signal Nopt at the receiver side is not limited to the above described example. The receiver can have a plurality of inverse quantizers having different step size updating coefficients corresponding to those of the transmitter side, and can recover the voice signal by selecting the optimum inverse quantizer by the selector according to the received coder number signal. Also the receiver can have a plurality of decoders having difference processing characteristics corresponding to each coding unit at the transmitter side, ana can select the optimum decoder according to the received coder number signal. Figure 6 shows an other embodiment of the coder according to the present invention. This coder is improved so that a better quality recovered voice signal is obtaIned at the receiver sice in comparison with the coder of Fig 3. The quantizer, the inverse quantizer, the zero predictor, and the pole predictor in each adaptive differential coder 11 to lk are adaptive controlled, and therefore, the parameters deciding the inner condition of the coding unit, for example, the quantization step size A n of the quantizer and the inverse quantizer and the prediction coefficient and tap data of the predictor, etc., vary successively at each of the differential coding units 11 to lk according to the processing procedure of the input signal, and become different at each differential coding unit. Accordingly, when the prior selected differential coding unit is changed to the other differential coding unit currently selected at a boundary between frames, in order to select the optimum differential coding unit, the aforementioned parameter of the prior selected coding unit and that of the currently selected coding unit are different. As a result, when the differential coding unit is switched, a discontinuity in the process of the input signal arises at the boundary between frames due to the difference between these parameters, therefore the discontinuity of the recovered signal also arises at the boundary between frames in the receiver side, and thus the recovered voice has a poor quality.The coder shown in Fig. 6 is intended to solve this problem. The difference between the coder of Fig. 6 and the coder of Fig. 3 is that the coder of Fig. 6 is provided with a parameter copy controller 6. That is, parameters P1to Pk from the differential coding unIts 1l to lk , wic parameters determine the inner condition or the coding unit, and the coder number signal Nopt frcm the evaluating unit 2 are input to the parameter copy controller 6.Here, parameters P, to Pk are quantizing K step sizes A nAl te A n k zero prediction coefficients Czl to Czk , pole prediction coefficients Cpl to Cpk , tap datas El to Ek , and tap datas Sl to Sk. The parameter copy controller 5 selects the parameter Popt of the optimum coding unit lopt according to the coder number signal Nopt and then sends it to all of the differential coding units 11 to 1k . The operation of the coder shown in Fig. 6 will be explained below. The optimum coding unit lopt is decided by the evaluating unit at the end of one frame of the voice signal X n , and then the coder number signal Nopt is sent to the selector 3, the multiplexer 4, and the parameter copy controller 5. The selector 3 sends one frame of the quantized value I n opt of the optimum coding unit lopt indicated by the signal Nopt to the multiplexer 4, and the multiplexer 4 then transmits this optimum quantized value I n opt with the coder number signal Nopt to the receiver side. On the other hand, the parameter copy controller 5 selects the optimum parameter Popt of the optimum coding unit 1 opt corresponding to the coder number signal Nopt from among the input parameters P1 to P , and then IC sends that parameter Popt to all of the differential coding units 11 to lk . Accordingly, all of the adaptive differential coding units copy the received optimum parameter Popt as an own parameter at the end of one frame. That is, at each adaptive differential coding unit, the quantizing step size A n opt is written in the quantizer 11 and the inverse quantizer 12, the zero prediction coefficient Cz.opt and the tap data Êopt are written in the coefficient multiplier of the zero predictor 14 and the tap thereof, respectively, and the pole prediction ccef c ent Cp.opt and the tap data Sopt are written in te coe cent multIplIer of the pole prediction 15 and the tap thereof, respectIvely. As a result, all of the adaptive differential coding units 11 to lk have the same inner condition as that of the currently selected adaptive differential coding unit 1 opt at the time of starting the next frame. Accordingly, when, for example, the adaptive differential coding unit 1. is selected as the optimum coding unit at current frame and then the adaptive differential coding unit 12 is selected at next frame, the parameter P1 of the differential coding unit 11 at the end point of the current frame coincides with the parameter P2 of the differential coding unit 12 at the starting point of the next frame, and therefore, no discontinuity arises at the boundary between the current and next frames. Figure 7 shows a further embodiment of the present invention. In the coding transmission equipment shown in Figs. 3 to 6, if the coder number signal Nopt indicating the optimum coding unit number is erroneous, the influence of the error extends over several frames, and thus the recovered voice at the receiver side has a poor quality. The equipment of Fig. 7 is intended to solve this problem. That is, the transmission equipment of Fig. 7 is provided with an error correction circuit for correcting the error arising in the transmitted optimum coder number signal Nopt. In Fig. 7, the coder number signal from the evaluating unit 2 is input to the multiplexer 4 via an error correcting coder 81, and then transmitted to the receiver side. On the other hand, at the receiver side, the coder number signal Nopt divided by the demulti plexer 6 is input, via an error correcting decoder 82, to the decoder 7, wherein the signal Nopt is input to the controller 72 as shown in Fig. 4 for con ollina the updating coefficIent M I n of the inverse cuant zer. The error correcting coder 8i and the error ccr ec ina decoder 82 carry out the terror correction as follows. First, in this example, the number of differential coding units is four, and each coding unit is given the coder numbers i 00it, 01 , 1C , and 11 . Figure 8 shows an example of an error coding code, Fig. 9 shows a format of one frame of the transmissIon signal, andFig. 10 shows an example of an error correction at the receiver side. As shown in Fig. 8 the error correcting code ECC is obtained by converting 0 and 1 of each digit of the coder number into 00 and 11 respectively. The transmission code is configured by arranging the high order digit error correcting code ECC h of the coder number, the high order digit N h thereof, the low order digit error correcting code ECC Q the coder number, and the low order digit N Q thereof, in seauence. Therefore, the coder number constituted by two digits is converted into the transmission code constituted by six digits and transmitted to the receiver side. In the receiver side, the error correcting decoder 82 decides whether each of the high and low order digits of the received transmission code is 0 or 1 by a majority of 0 and I thereof, and corrects all digits of each of the high and low order digit of the received transmission code to 000 or 111 according to the majority decision, thereby recovering the correct high and low order of the digits of the coder number. For example, Fig. 10 shows the error correction of high order digits of the received transmission code at the receiver side. As shown in Fig. 10, 001 , 010 , and 100 of the high order digits wherein 1 may be erroneous are corrected to 000 . Also, 011, 101 , and 110 wherein OR may be erroneous are corrected to 111 . Various ICinr s o error correcting codes are known, and a suitable error correcting code may v be adopted according to the n nne of diffe e t al coding units and kind of coder number to be transmitted, etc. Assuming that a sampling frequency of the input voice signal is 6. kHz, and the quantized value code of the prediction error is 2 bits at each sample point, an example of a bit allocation of the frame which transmits the quantized value codes of 16 sample poInts will be explained below. One frame is constituted by 39 bits wherein 32 bits are the quantized value codes, each of which is 2 bits of 16 samples, 2 bits are the coder number, and 4 bits are error correcting codes ECC h ECC Q . Each frame is transmitted during 2.5 ms 1 400 sec corresponding to a 16 sample period at a sampling frequency of 6.4 KHz, therefore the transmission rate is 15.6 Kbit sec. Figure 11 shows still another embodiment of the receiver side of the coding transmission equipment according to the present invention. The difference between the embodiment of Fig. 5 and this embodiment of Fig. 11 is that here a post processing filter is provided. The post processing filter carries out the signal process of the decoded signal in order to improve an auditory sense of the recovered voice. This postprocessing filter is disclosed in a paper entitled Enhancement of ADPCM Speech by Adaptive Post filtering by V. Ramamoorthy N.S. Jayant, published at the ICC 85 held in the USA.According to this paper, when a transfer function A z of the pole predictor 76 of the predictor 74 and a transfer function B z of the zero predictor 75 thereof are as follows, EMI18.1 a transfer function At z of a pole post Frocessine filter 86 of the post processing filter 8 and a transfer function Bl z of a zero post crocessing filter 85 is assumed to be as follows.EMI18.2 0 alpha 1, 0 ss 1 The principal structure of the predictor 74 and the post processing filter 8 disclosed in this paper is shown in Fig. 12. In Fig. 12, the reference symbols of the coefficient multipliers denote the coefficients thereof, respectively, for simplification of the explanation. The predictor of the decoder 7 shown at left side of Fig. 12 comprises the zero predictor 75 including six time delay elements z 1, six coefficient multipliers b1 to b6, and an adder Al adding output signals of multipliers b to b6 , which realizes the transfer function B z , and the pole predictor 76 comprising two time delay elements z 1, two coefficient multipliers a1 and a2 , and an adder A2 adding output signals of the multipliers a1 and a2 , which realizes the transfer function A z .Output signals of the zero predictor 75 and the pole predictor 76 are added to the signal E n obtained by inverse quantizing the quantized value from the transmitter side at the inverse quantizer 71 Fig. 11 by the adder 73, to obtain the recovered voice signal S n . A block at the right side in Fig. 12 is a postprocessing filter 8 , which comprises a zero postprocessing filter 85, a pole post procssslng filter 86, and an adder 83. The zero post processIng filter 85 is further provided with ss coefficient multipliers ss and 3 to B insert between coer cent multipliers bl to b2 and the adder Al, respectively, in comparison with the zero predictor 75 in order to carry out the operation of 5 coeffIcient which is a power of B. The pole post processIng filter is provided with a coefficient multiplier a and a inserted between coef icient multipliers al and a2 and the adder A2, respectively, in comparison with the pole predictor 76.Output signals of post processing filters 85 and 86 are added to the recovered voice output S n at the adder 83, whereby the auditory sense of the recovered output is improved, and then output as an improved output Z. The aforementioned coefficients b1 to b6 , a1 and a2 are updated to adapt to the input signal, and must have the same values at the predictor and the postprocessing filter. Also, the coefficients a and ss at the post processing filter are updated to adapt to the input signal. In Fig. 11, the post processing filter 8, such as the filter shown in Fig. 12, is disposed at the output side of the decoder 7. This post processing filter 8 is provided with a coefficient weighting circuit 88 for controlling the coefficients a and ss of the zero and pole post processing filters 85 and 86. The coefficients of the coefficients multipliers bl to b6 of the zero post processing filter 85 and the coefficient multipliers al and a2 of the pole post processing filter 86 are kept at the same values as those of the coefficients b1 to b6 of the zero predictor 75 and coefficients a1 and a2 of the pole predictor 76 , respectively, by the coefficient weighting circuit 88.Also, the power coefficient ss of the zero post processing filter 85 and the power coefficient a of the pole post processina filter 86 are adjusted to suitable values for carrying out a suitable post processing by the coefficlent weighting circuit 88. The coe r ,cnts a and 5 are set to a value between 0 to I. Note in this example, is 1.0 and is 0.2. As described above, the recovered voice output having a further improved quality can be obtained by adding the post processing filter having a characteristic which is changed according to the characteristic of the adaptive differential coding unit at the transmitter side. In the embodiments explained hereinbefore, the present invention is applied to the ADPCM system. But, of course, the present invention is not limited to theADPCM system, namely, the present invention may be adapted to systems wherein the adaptive quantization is carried out as, for example, APCM Adaptive Pulse CodeModulation , ADM Adaptive Delta Modulation , SBC SubBand Coding , VRC Variable Rate Coding , APC AdaptivePredictive Coding , and ATC Adaptive TransformCoding , etc.
