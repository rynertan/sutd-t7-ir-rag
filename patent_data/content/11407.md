# X ray examination apparatus, particularly for X ray photographs of the head.

## Abstract
Precise orientation of an x ray apparatus in which the x ray tube 10 and film cassette 11 are mounted on opposite ends of a C shaped arm 14 is facilitated by a chair 1 for the patient which is precisely movable along X and Y axes with the digital readout of adjusted positions. The angular rotation of the chair 1 also has a digital readout. All of the readouts 60,62,64 may be adjusted to zero at basic positions to facili tate adjustment. The angle of the C arm 14 is displayed by an inclinometer 48 which also may be adjusted to zero at a basic position. The chair 1 has an adjustable cradle 6 for the head and the entire chair may be tilted to an acute angle to support unconscious or disabled patients without interfering sup ports. Orientation of the C arm 14 is also facilitated by a light source 44 removably mounted over the film cassette 11 , which designates the exit point of the x ray on the patient.
