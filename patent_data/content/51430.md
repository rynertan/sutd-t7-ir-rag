# X Ray apparatus.

## Abstract
X ray stereoscopic cinematography apparatus uses an X ray tube 1 having a pair of focal points fr and fl on the anode P , from which X ray beams can be radiated indepen dently. Focal points fr and fl are spaced by the inter ocular distance. The X ray beams are directed through an object 2 such as a patient, and are received by an image intensifier 3 which emits an optical image received by an optical system 4 . The optical beam can be diverted to either or both of cinecameras 5 and 6 for receiving right and left images. A television camera 7 is arranged to receive both images. The shutters of the cinecameras are synchronised but are 180 out of phase, so that both shutters are never open at the same time. Mode selector 8 can select a stereoscopic radiographic mode, a mono scopic radio graphic mode or a fluoroscopic mode. When the first is selected, X ray beams are emitted alternately from the focal points fr and fl in synchronism with the shutters of the cinecameras 5, 6 so that the first cinecamera 5 receives only right images and the other cinecamera 6 receives only the left images. In the mono scopic radiographic mode X ray beams are emitted from only one of the two focal points and only one of the cinecameras is activated. In the fluoroscopic mode, X ray beams from only one of the focal points is emitted, neither cinecamera is activated and the optical image is received only by the television camera 7 .
