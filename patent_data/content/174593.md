## Description
The present invention relates to a digital circuit, especially a digital tank circuit for use in such a circuit as a timing extractor for extracting timing information from an input signal. A prior art digital tank circuit comprises sampling converting means for sampling an analog signal at predetermined intervals of time and converting sampled values into corresponding predetermined binary codes, and a digital filter including adders, multipliers and delay elements. An example of such a digital filter is disclosed in a paper entitled A New Hardware Realization of Digital Filters by A. Peled and B. Liu, published in the IEEE Transactions ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, ASSP 22 6 , pages 456 to 462, December 1974. Since the prior art filter requires at least four complicated multipliers, its manufacturing cost becomes high. Also, in the gain characteristic of the digital filter to be used in the tank circuit, the sharper the peak at the center frequency is caused to be, the more the influence of roundoff errors produced at the multipliers is to an extent not negligible. An example of digital filters without multipliers is described in a paper entitled Increased Speed in Digital Filters without Multipliers by Ernst Lüder, published in 646 Archiv für Elecktronik und Übertragungstechnik, vol. 36, no. 9, Sept. 1982, pages 345 348, Würzburg, DE. This paper presents fast second order equivalent structures which require only two consecutive parallel additions of four adders. The paper further discusses how the speed of signal processing may be increased showing several examples for filters. One object of the invention is, therefore, to provide a digital circuit without using multipliers free from the above mentioned disadvantages in the prior art circuit. This object is achieved by the features set out in the claims. Other features and advantages of the invention will be made more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which In these drawings, the same reference numerals represent the same structural elements. Description will be made on the embodiments of the invention in detail hereinafter. Referring to Fig. 3, a prior art digital tank circuit comprises a slicer 11, a sampler 12 and a digital filter 13. An input signal i is previously converted to contain a large quantity of components of a frequency f₀ to be extracted. The converted signal a is applied as a high frequency analog signal to the slicer 11. The conversion is performed by a full wave rectifier when the input signal i is a bipolar signal and by a circuit cascade connected with a differential circuit and a full wave rectifier when the input signal i is an NRZ non return to zero signal. The high frequency analog signal a thus obtained is sliced by the slicer 11, sampled by the sampler 12 at a sampling interval T Referring to Fig. 1, a first embodiment of the invention comprises a slicer 31 receiving the high frequency analog signal a obtained by the above mentioned conversion of the input signal i , slicing the signal a and outputting a sliced signal c , a low pass filter 44 given the sliced signal c , a sampler 32 sampling an output signal from the filter 44 at an interval of time T The transfer function H z of the second order infinite impulse response IIR filter, based on the configuration of the prior art digital filter 13 shown in Fig. 3, is expressed as In the embodiment, the sampling frequency f The configuration of the digital filter 33 realizes the above mentioned transfer function. The operation of 1 2 Referring to Fig. 4A, the slicer 31 consists of an operation amplifier 311, resistors 312 through 315 and a diode 316. The resulting signal a Fig. 5B obtained by rectifying the input bipolar signal i Fig. 5A is applied to a non inversion input terminal of the amplifier 311, which outputs a signal a Fig. 5C expressed as where R Referring to Fig. 4B, a low pass filter 44 comprises a comparator 441, a 12 bit counter 442 supplied with an output signal c shown in Fig. 5E of the comparator 441, and a terminal 444 through which a clock signal j shown in Fig. 5K is given. The comparator 441 outputs a logic 1 hereunder abbreviated as 1 signal when the signal c is not less than 0 volt, and a logic 0 hereunder abbreviated as 0 signal when the signal c is less than 0 volt. The content of the counter 442 is reset to zero at each rise time of the signal c , that is, at each time of changing from 0 to 1 . The clock signal j having a repetive period of 1 24 f₀ sec is supplied to the counter 442. The content of the counter 442 is incremented by one when the signal c is 1 at the rise time of the signal j , and is produced as a 12 bit binary code d d₀d₁ .... d₁₁ , where d₀ is a sign bit. Fig. 5F shows the output binary code d from the counter 442 in analog form. Referring to Fig. 4C, the sampler 32 comprises 12 n flip flops 321 1 through 321 12 n , each of which is given a corresponding one of the high order 12 n bits d₀ through d Referring to Fig. 4D showing where the number n of shifts is 6, the shifter 37 is constructed to receive the code e e₀e₁e₂e₃e₄e₅ and output a 12 bit code e₀e₀e₀e₀e₀e₀e₀e₁e₂e₃e₄e₅ as the above mentioned first 12 bit code to the adder 41. Namely, the shifter 37 outputs the code consisting of the code e and n bits which are added on the high order side of the code e . Each of the n bits is equal to the sign bit e₀ of the code e . The shifter 35, which has the same configuration as that of the shifter 37, outputs the above mentioned seventh 12 bit code consisting of the high order 12 n bits of the above mentioned fifth 12 bit code and n bits which are added on the high order side of the high order 12 n bits. Each of the n bits is equal to the sign bit of the fifth code. The shifters 34 and 38 also have similar configuration to the shifter 37, so description of them is omitted. Fig. 5H shows the output f of the filter 33. Since the input signal i includes the component of the frequency f₀, it is understandable that the filter 33 outputs the signal f having the frequency f₀. This makes it clear that the circuit shown in Fig. 1 operates as a tank circuit. Referring to Fig. 2, a second embodiment of the invention comprises a slicer 31, a low pass filter 44, a sampler 32, and a digital filter 45. The digital filter 45 includes shifters 37, 38 and 35, adders 41, 42 and 43, inverters 34 and 36, delay elements 39 and 40 and a roundoff error canceller 46. The canceller 46 comprises an adder 461 having a first set of 12 input terminals and a second set of 12 input terminals which receives 12 bit code from the delay element 40, an extractor 465, an inverter 464, a delay element 463 and a delay element 462. The adder 461 performs an addition of the codes applied to the first and second sets of 12 terminals to supply the addition result as a tenth 12 bit code to the shifter 35. The extractor 465 extracts a bit string of the low order n bits from the tenth code and outputs an eleventh 12 bit code which consists of the extracted bit string and 12 n bits added on the high order side of the extracted bit string. The 12 n bits assume all O s . The inverter 464 inverts each bit of the eleventh code to output the inverted code as a twelfth 12 bit code. The delay element 463 outputs the twelfth code as a thirteenth 12 bit code after holding the twelfth code by the time equal to the sampling interval T Accordingly, As apparent from this equation, the output error e t of the shifter 35 is not amplified, that is, the amplification of e t is at most Δ 2 Δ 2 On the other hand, in the first embodiment without the canceller 46, the output error of the shifter 35 is amplified at most to 2 Referring to Fig. 6, a timing extractor circuit using the tank circuit according to the invention comprises a full wave rectifier 1000 rectifying the analog input signal i , a tank circuit 1100 having the same configuration as that of the first or second embodiment, a 1 bit D A converter 1200, a fixed phase corrector 1300, an adaptive phase corrector 1400, and a sampler 1500. The biopolar input signal analog input signal i is converted so as to contain as many components of the frequency f₀ as possible through the full wave rectifier 1000, and then supplied to the tank circuit 1100. The 12 bit output code f of the tank circuit 1100 is supplied through the 1 bit D A converter 1200 to the fixed phase corrector 1300. The corrector 1300 delays the phase of a signal g , which is supplied from the converter 1200, by several periods of the master clock signal j and then outputs the signal g as a signal h . The signal h is supplied as a sampling clock signal having the frequency f₀ to the sampler 1500. In the sampler 1500, the input analog signal i is sampled at each rise time of the sampling clock signal h , and 0 or 1 of the bipolar signal input analog signal i is detected. On the other hand, the output code f of the tank circuit 1100 is also supplied to the adaptive phase corrector 1400. The adaptive phase corrector 1400 functions to detect the phase of the output of the tank circuit 1100 according to the below described method, generate a clock signal b of the frequency f₀ 4f The converter 1200, for example. functions to output only the sign bit of the output code f of the tank circuit 1100 as the signal g Fig. 5I . Referring to Fig. 7A, the corrector 1300 consists of M positive integer flip flops 1301 1 through 1301 M interconnected in cascade. To the first flip flop 1301 1, the output signal g of the converter 1200 is applied. Each flip flop takes the output of the preceding flip flop therein in synchronism with the cloak signal j . The output signal h of the last flip flop 1301 M is shown in Fig. 5J. As understood from the comparison of Figs. 5I and 5J, the signal h is delayed from signal g by M 24f₀ sec . Referring to Fig. 7B, the circuit 1400 comprises a group of 12 flip flops 1401 1 through 1401 12 corresponding to individual bits of the 12 bit code f a comparator 1402 which compares a 12 bit code x₀x₁ .... x₁₁ incoming to the group of flip flops 1401 1 through 1401 12 with another 12 bit code y₀y₁ .... y₁₁ produced from them, and output 1 only when the code x₀x₁ .... x₁₁ is greater than the code y₀y₁ .... y₁₁ a NOR gate 1403 which performs a NOR operation of the sign bit of the code f given to the flip flop 1401 and the sign bit produced from the flip flop 1401 an octal up down counter 1410 whose content is incremented by one when the output of the comparator 1402 at the rise time of the output signal of the gate 1403 is 1 and decremented by one when it is 0 a frequency divider 1411 responsive to the clock signal j for producing a divided signal whose frequency is equal to 1 6 times frequency of the clock signal j a group of five flip flops 1404 through 1408 which operates in synchronism with the clock signal j and a selector 1409 which receives outputs of the flip flops 1404 through 1408 at input terminals D₁ through D₅ , respectively, and a output of the divider 1411 at a input terminal D₀. To an input terminal D of the flip flop 1404, the output of the divider 1411 is applied. Fig. 7C is a truth table illustrating an operation of the selector 1409. Q₀, Q₁ and Q₂ represent a 3 bit signal fed from the counter 1410, D₁, D₂, D₃, D₄ and D₅ are signals fed from the flip flops 1404, 1405, 1406, 1407 and 1408, respectively, and Y is an output signal b of the selector 1409.
