# Addition polymerizable polyethers having one pendant ethylenically unsaturated urethane group.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to an addition polymerizable polymer characterized as a polyether having at least one pendant group which is an oxycarbonylamino aliphatic ester of an α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid. Those polyethers undergo addition polymerization upon exposure to suitable active radiation and or chemical initiation. Optionally, these polymerization polymers are mixed and reacted with copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The polymers of this invention are useful in coating substrates, ink and varnish formulations and other conventional compositions requiring a curable polymer.
