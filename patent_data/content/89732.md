# Fibers and fibrous assembly of wholly aromatic polyamide.

## Abstract
A fiber composed of a wholly aromatic polyamide has 1 a cross sectional area varying in size at irregular intervals along its longitudinal direction, and 2 an intrafilament cross sectional area variation coef ficient CV F of from 0.05 to 1.0, and numerous such fibers can provide a fibrous assembly such that 3 when said assembly is cut at any arbitrary position thereof in a direction at right angles to the fiber axis, ther sizes of the cross sectional areas of the individual fibers differ from each other substantially at random.
