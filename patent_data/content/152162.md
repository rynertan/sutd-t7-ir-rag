# Process of coating a heated article using a sterically stabilised coating composition and compositions useful in the process.

## Abstract
A process of coating a surface of an article which is capable of being heated, by contacting the heated surface of the article with a coating composition comprising an aqueous dispersion of an organic film forming material which is sterically stabilised and which has a critical coalescence temperature which is lower than the tempera ture to which the surface of the article is heated. Suitable coating compositions are described.
