# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO PYROELECTRIC DETECTORS

## Abstract
A pyroelectric detector element having defined on a major surface two spaced areas A, C exhibiting radiation absorbing and or reflecting properties. A mirror like area D comprising a dielectric material is provided in at least part of the space, and preferably extends over all or substantially all of the space, de fined between the two spaced areas A, C to reflect the radia tion and provide a substantially nil output contribution for the radiation falling on the space.
