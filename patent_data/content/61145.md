# Pulley for cogged belt and method for producing same.

## Abstract
A pulley 10 for use with a cogged belt, comprises first and second discs 12, 14 formed of sheet metal and secured with each other as a single unit, each disc being formed at its peripheral section with a plurality of teeth 16 , the teeth 16 of the first and second discs 12, 14 being so bent that the bent portion 16a of each tooth of the first disc 12 and the same of the second disc 14 project in the opposite direction to each other, thereby greatly lightening the weight of the pulley to suppress the noise generation due to the vibration of a crankshaft and a camshaft of an engine.
