# CLEAR MICELLIZED SOLUTIONS OF FAT SOLUBLE ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS

## Abstract
Micellized aqueous formulations for fat soluble vitamins, essential nutrients, herb oils and pharmaceutical agents are obtained by a process wherein the fat soluble vitamin, essential nutrient or agent is first admixed with a suitable amount of polyethoxylated castor oil and a pharmaceutically acceptable polyol, such as glycerol to provide a non aqueous phase. Thereafter, an aqueous phase containing mostly water and optionally a preservative, such as sodium benzo ate, is slowly added to the agitated non aqueous phase in such a manner that the temperature of the non aqueous phase, including the aqueous phase added thereto, is maintained at an elevated temperature, preferably between approximately 60 to 100 C. After cooling, the final admixture is clear, homogeneous, having micellos of approximately 2 microns or smaller size. Human subjects exhibit significantly higher blood plasma levels of vitamins A and E after ingestion of the formation of the present invention, than after ingestion of comparable doses of prior art vitamin A and E formulations.
