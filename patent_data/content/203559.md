## Description
QUINOLINE LACTAMINE DERIVATIVE HAVING ANTIBACTERIAL AND ss LACTAMASES INHIBITORY ACTIVITY The present invention relates to a novel penicillanic derivative, having specific antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains producing B lactamases as well as against strains resistant to the commonly used ss lactam antibiotics. The compound object of the present invention is D A g l ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 methyl 4 oxo 1,8 naphthyri dine 3 carboxyamido a p hydroxyphenyl acetamidogpenicil lanic acid, of formula IEMI1.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Compound I may be prepared by reacting 6 D a amino p hydroxyphenyl acetamido penicillanic acid, known as Amoxicillin, and a reactive derivative of l ethyl 1,4 dihydro 7 methyl 4 oxo l, 8 naphthyridine 3 carboxylic acid nalidixic acid , such as the acyl chloride or the mixed anhydride. The reaction is usually carried out in anhydrous aprotic solvents, optionally in the presence of acid acceptor agents, where the acyl chloride is used as the reactive derivative, at a temperature ranging from 10 to 100C, preferably from 0 to 50C. Compound I proved to have valuable microbiological characteristics, which make it useful in therapy in the treatment of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria supported infections in humans and warm blood animals. The minimal inhibitory concentrations MIC against some Gram and Gram amoxicillin resistant bacteria amoxicillin MIC 800 pg ml are reported in Table 1 hereinbelow TABLE 1 Minimal inhibitory concentrations of compound I.EMI2.1 tb Species SEP N SEP SEP of SEP strains SEP MIC SEP average SEP value tb SEP Fg ml SEP tb E.

SEP 4 SEP SEP 3.12 tb These results clearly show a marked antibacterial activity, particularly against penicillinase producingStaphylococcus strains. Very interesting is also the activity exerted against Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, which are known to be resistant to Amoxicillin, to ss lactamic antibiotics and generally to quinoline like compounds, which usually show no significant activity against Grampositive bacteria. Compound I, whilst deriving from two well known antibacterial agents, is endowed with superior antibacterial properties, which do not derive from those of amoxi cillin and of nalidixic acid. Compound I, therefore, must be considered in any aspect a new derivative of 6 amino penicillanic acid, also taking into account its remarkable stability. In order to further evaluate its therapeutic potentiality, compound I was tested for any inhibitory activity against B lactamases. Table 2 hereinbelows shows the obtained results, which evidence that compound I is a strong inhibitory agent of ss lactamases from both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, said compound completely inhibiting any enzymatic activity in a dosage of 100 TABLE 2 inhibition by compound I against hydrolysis rates of ss lactamases EMI3.1 tb B Lactamase SEP Conc.

Table 3 shows the obtained results, which evidence a synergetic action of compound I with amoxicillin.

The bacterial strains and plasmids listed in Table 4 were used. Phenotype symbols according Novick et al. 1976 were used.

The following antibiotics were used streptomycin Sm , tetracycline Tc , ampicillin Ap , kanamycin Km and rifampicin Rif . Compound I in 1 and 10 mcg ml concentrations was used in the transfer mixtures. Microorganisms were grown in Nutrient Broth B.B.L. , NB, or in Nutrient Agar or Mc Conkey Agar B.B.L. . Appropriate antibiotic concentrations were added to the selection plates. Sm 10, Te 10, Ap 30, Km 30, Rif 100 and Nal 50. 8 Bacterial strains were incubated till 2.5 x 10 cells ml of nutrient broth exponential phase, and crossed in a donor recipient 1 5 ratio in 2 xbroth during 18 hours at 370C. On the other hand, in the interrupted crosses, the bacteria were stirred by means of the Vortex apparatus for 1 minute after 1 h cross. About one hundred colonies, which could growth on the selection plates containing the various antibiotics were checked for the resistance spectrum by replica plating . The transfer frequence was expressed as the number of resistent recipients in comparison with the number of do nors in the mating mixtures, at the plating time. The inhibition rate of plasmid transfer was evaluated in tests in which, in the mating mixtures, compound I was present in I or 10 mcg ml concentrations. The activity of compound I was tested in different cross systems between E. coli x E. coli. Table 5 shows the inhibition percentages of the transfer obtained with three different plasmids of incompatibility groups Inc Fi, Inc P and Inc M. The ability of compound I to reduce the transfer of the tested plasmids is evidenced.

Compound I, besides being active against resistant strains and stable to 13 lactamases, is also stable to tryptic enzymes trypsin, pepsin, etc. and it is suitable for topical use, due to its peculiar activity againstStaphylococci and Pseudomonas, which are among the more common infecting agents in cutaneous diseases. Moreover, compound I may be conveniently combined with ss lactamase sensitive cephalosporins or penicillins, in order to obtain a synergetic antibacterial action. The present invention relates also to all the industrial applications of compound I as a therapeutic agent. Another object of the invention consists therefore in pharmaceutical compositions containing as the active ingredient 10 to 3000 mg of compound I or equivalent amounts of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for oral, parenteral or topical administration. Generally, the daily dosage will range from 500 mg to 5.0 g, depending also on age, weight and conditions of the patient.
