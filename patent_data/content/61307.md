# Compositions comprising a wax and an organopolysiloxane.

## Abstract
Improved wax compositions comprising certain hydro carbon ester containing organopolysiloxanes are disclosed. These compositions have improved shelf stability and excellent luster bestowing properties, lubricating properties and water repellant properties. They are useful in textile manufacture, such as treating sewing threads and textile warps, and for protecting surfaces, such as furniture surfaces and automobile surfaces.
