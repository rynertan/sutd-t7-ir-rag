# Bill storing mechanism for an automatic teller.

## Abstract
In an automatic bill issuing and depositing machine, bill stackers, each being associated with one denomination of bills, are utilized to receive and store bills inserted into the machine by a customer for depositing them and to dispense bills stored therein for issuing them to a customer. The stacker is provided with a paddle wheel assembly 22 movable up and down to keep or follow a predetermined small distance between the wheel and the top of the stacked bills 24 so that the bill released from the wheel can be stacked without irregularity. When the bills in the stacker are to be dispensed, the weight of the paddle wheel assembly 22 and its supporting assembly is applied onto the stack to enable the bills to be positively fed out from the bottom of the stacker one by one by a rotating separator wheel 25 .
