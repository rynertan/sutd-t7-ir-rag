# Schottky barrier diode with a guard ring and method of making same.

## Abstract
The Schottky barrier diode having a self aligned guard ring comprises a dielectric layer 3 on a silicon substrate said layer 3 having a substantially vertically walled hole therein, a doped silicon lining 5 being of uniform width covering the silicon along the walls of said hole and contact metal 7 on said substrate exposed within the inner perimeter of that lining 5 . To produce such a diode a hole ist etched anisotropically into a dielectric layer 3 on a silicon substrate. Then a doped silicon layer 4 is deposited which is reactively ion etched, to expose said substrate through said hole. By heating the dopant in the remainder of said silicon layer 4 is diffused into the substrate. Onto the exposes substrate metal 7 is applied.
