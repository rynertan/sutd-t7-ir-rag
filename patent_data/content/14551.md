# Opposed piston internal combustion engine with special scavenging means.

## Abstract
An opposed piston internal combustion engine com prises a scavenging plate 28 which is pressure operated. A combustion chamber is defined by piston 2 and the scaveng ing plate 28 . The engine may be of the two stroke free piston type. Pistons 2 may be connected to the main shaft 23 by con necting rods or a sector pinion rack mechanism 42,5 .
