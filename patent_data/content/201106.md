# ABSOLUTE POSITION ENCODER

## Abstract
A digital position encoder for determining the absolute position of a servo controlled mechanism such as a robot joint comprises an incremental encoder 32 and a discrete encoder 34 . The incremental encoder 32 produces puls es indicating the incremental rotation of the motor drive shaft 24 for the joint and an index pulse once each rotation of the shaft. The discrete encoder 34 comprises a set of precessing gears 42, 44, 46 driven by the motor shaft 24 , each of which produces a mark pulse once each rotation. The angular displacements of the precessing gears with respect to the index pulse are measured, using signals from the incremental encoder 32 , thus determining a unique motor revolution positon in the range of motor revolutions which span the range of motion of the servo controlled member. The motor revolution position and the incremental position are combined mathematically to yield the absolute position of the servo controlled member.
