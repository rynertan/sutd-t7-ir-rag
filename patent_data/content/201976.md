# Lockable piston cylinder assembly.

## Abstract
Locakable piston cylinder assembly to be mounted between two parts being movable relative to each other such as a frame and top or foot end of a bed structure. The two chambers 7, 8 resulting from the division of piston 2 in cylinder 1 are interconnected by a hollow piston rod 3 provided with openings 9 and 10 . At least one of these openings can be closed by valve member 4 arranged in said piston rod and so connection between these chambers 7, 8 is controlled. Valve member 4 is actuatable from one end of piston rod 3 outside cylinder 1 . For obviating undesired pressure build up in space 20 or for controlling the pressure in this space a connection 14 is provided to the exterior of cylinder 1 .
