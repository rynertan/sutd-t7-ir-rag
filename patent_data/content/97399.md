# Metallic container and method for filling.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a metallic container 1 particu larly for foodstuff or beverages comprising a circumferential wall, a bottom and a lid, in which container is prevailing a lowe pressure than the atmospheric pressure in the filled and closed state. The invention has for its object to construct a metallic container in a manner such that the desired mechanical strength can be obtained even with a very small wall thickness and hence at very low costs of material. The invention has furthermore for its object to design a metallic container in a manner such that the probability of undesirable deformation is substantially excluded. For the above mentioned purposes the invention pro vides a metallic container 1 of the kind set forth in the preamble, the circumferential wall of which has at least one zone 7 that can be pressed inwards by the effect of the difference between the atmospheric pressure and the press ure inside the container.
