# DISPERSIONS OF SOLID FUEL IN OIL

## Abstract
Dispersions of a friable solid fuel in oil are pre pared by grinding coal together with a minor proportion of green petroleum coke in a fuel oil medium. Air is excluded from the grinding operation and the mean particle size of the solid fuel particles is reduced to a value in the range 1 to 15 micron. The dispersion con tains 15 to 55 by weight of solid fuel. The presence of the coke enhances the stability of the dispersions which are suitable for use as indus trial fuel oils.
