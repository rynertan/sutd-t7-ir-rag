# Spout aiming system for an agricultural machine.

## Abstract
A servo mechanism controls the left right angle of a spout so as to maintain the difference between a signal from a wagon machine angle sensor and a signal from a spout angle sensor within a certain range, by actuation of spout right and spout left relays 110 and 114 which provide signals on corresponding lines 68 and 66 to a hydraulic system driving the spout. A manually operable switch can also be used to energise line 68 or line 66 for moving the spout within the substantial dead band normally existing, for ensuring even wagon filling. When the wagon machine angle is large a circuit 195 provides a signal line 91 to increase the servo gain. To ensure re alignment of the spour when the wagon machine angle becomes small again, a timer 198 delays reversion to the low servo gain. A circuit 300 detects actuation of the manual switch and then applies a signal to the timer to reduce the delay.
