## Description
The invention relates to a weatherstrip comprising the features as indicated in the pre characterising part of claim 1. Such a weatherstrip as disclosed in DE A 28 18 225 is disposed for sealing a space between the door and body of a vehicle. This known weatherstrip comprises a cavity which is urged by vacuum such that an elastically deformable extension will be caused to contact the vehicle body. Opening or closing of the door is only possible when urging the weatherstrip with vacuum is interrupted. It is the object of the invention to provide a sealing structure for sealing a clearance between opposing edges of a front pillar and a front door which prevents turbulent air flow around the front pillar and which is simply effected. In accordance with the invention, this object is solved by the features as claimed in the characterising part of claim 1. The inventive weatherstrip comprises an extension, a part of which is in continuously engaging contact with two members of the vehicle, caused by an elastic deformation of said part in order to seal a space between the members of the vehicle. Since the part of the extension is disposed such that it is lying approximately in alignment with the outer surfaces of said members, turbulent airflows are prevented in a simple manner. Further developments of the invention are claimed in the sub claims. The present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings of the preferred embodiment of invention, which, however, should not be considered to limit the invention to the specific embodiment but to be for explanation only. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an automotive vehicle for which the preferred embodiment of a sealing structure is applied Fig. 2 is a cross section taken along line II II of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a section of a weatherstrip of the sealing structure according to the preferred embodiment. Referring now to the drawings, particularly to Figs. 1 and 2, a vehicle as illustrated, has a front door 10 of the so called press door type. The front door 10 is provided with a door sash 12 surrounding a window pane 14. The door sash 12 has a front end portion 16 curved inwardly to oppose the front edge 18 to a edge 20 of a front pillar 22. The front edge 18 of the front door sash 12 and the edge 20 of the front pillar 22 are separated by a fixed clearance 24 when the front door 10 is closed. As shown in Fig. 2, the front pillar 22 comprises inner and outer members 26 and 28 which define an essentially box shaped cross section. The outside and inside edges of the inner and outer members 26 and 28 form with flanges 29 and 30 along both vertical edges. The flanges 29 and 30 of the front pillar inner and outer members 26 and 28 help to form the box like cross section. A front window pane 32 is bonded to the flange 29 and by a suitable adhesive. A weatherstrip 36 is installed to the flange 30. The weatherstrip 36 has an essentially U shaped major portion 37, a substantially hollow cylindrical extension 38 and an extension strip 40. The cylindrical extension 38 elastically abuts a door sash inner member 42 to which the front edge of a door sash outer member 44 is attached by the process of hemming. The cylindrical extension 38 thus establishes a water tight seal between the door sash inner member 42 and the flange 30. The extension strip 40 is designed to contact the front pillar outer member 28 to form a water tight seal. A retainer 46 is fixedly secured to the front pillar outer member 28 so that a portion 48 thereof projects towards the front door. A weatherstrip 50 is attached to the projection 48 of the retainer 46. The weatherstrip 50 has an essentially U shaped major portion 52 with inwardly protruding lips 54, sealing lip 56 and 58, and an extension 60 with a substantially hollow cylindrical tip 62. The sealing lip 56 extends towards the door sash inner member 42 and comes into water tight contact therewith. The sealing lip 56 with the major portion 52 of the weatherstrip 50 extends along the front pillar 22 and is associated with a drip seal not shown attached to a roof side rail to define a drain channel. Likewise, the sealing lip 58 is adapted to sealingly contact the front pillar outer member 28. The extension 60 with the cylindrical tip 62 extends towards the clearance 24 between the front edge 18 of the door sash 12 and the edge 20 of the front pillar 22, so as to contact both of them. The clearance 24 is sealed by the cylindrical tip 62 of the extension so that the air stream flowing around the front pillar will not be disturbed by the gap between the front pillar and the front door. As shown in Fig. 3, the cylindrical tip 62 of the extension 60 has a substantially circular cross section and can be deformed elastically in contact with the corresponding surfaces of the door sash and the front pillar outer member. In this position, the cylindrical tip 62 is compressed so that part of its surface is approximately in alignment with the outer surfaces of the front pillar and the front door sash so that it constitutes an essentially smooth external surface, as shown in Fig. 2. With the sealing structure as set forth, a smooth surface is provided around the front pillar for smooth air flow therearound, thus improving aerodynamics. Since the gap between the front door and the front pillar is filled by the tip of the extension integrally formed with the weatherstrip, turbulent air flow will not be created and thus screaming sounds will not be generated. Furthermore, according to the shown construction, installation of the seal of the clearance between the front door and the front pillar require no additional parts or process steps. This will help to maintain the cost of manufacture at nearly the conventional level while improving vehicle acoustics and aerodynamics significantly. In addition, the seal established by the tip of the extension may serve to prevent rain water and so forth from entering the vehicle compartment in co operation with the sealing lip of the weatherstrip 50 and the weatherstrip 36. It should be appreciated that the tip of the extension need not necessarily be of hollow cylindrical cross section but can be of any appropriate shape.
