## Description
STABILISED D PliTHALIsIIC FORMULATION The present invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations containing a preservative. More specifically it is concerned with liquid pharmaceutical formulations in which a mercury containing compound is employed as a preser vative. Thiom er sal, sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate, is an effective antifungal and antibacterial agent widely used as a preservative in pharmaceutical formulations, particularly liquid formulations such as ophthalmic solutions.It has long been recognised that Thiomersal decomposes in aqueous media, but as its biological, i.e preservative, action is not impaired thereby such decomposition has not, in the past, been of great concern. However, in more recent times the requirements of regulatory authorities have become more stringent and in order that a product may be marketed it is essential to meet these new criteria. Amongst these criteria are those that the product and its ingredients be shown to be non toxic in man and should be stable on storage under normal conditions. The toxicity of any decomposition products may be unknown or only poorly characterised. The stability of ingredients which may potentially give rise to toxic breakdown products is of particular importance in this respect, and amongst such ingredients are mercury containing preservatives such as Thiomersal.Liquid pharmaceutical formulations frequently contain isotonic agents to ensure that the formulation is isotonic with blood serum or lachrymal secretions.Whilst such formulations may be presented in a non isotonic form it is generally preferred to render such formulations isotonic in order to avoid patient discomfort, biological damage to the patient or ineffective treatment. Thus, for example, non isotonic ophthalmic formulations cause substantial stinging of the eye resulting not only in patient discomfort but in loss of the active ingredients from the site of action through watering of the eye and thus ineffective treatment.The most commonly employed isotonic agents are ionic agents, in particular sodium chloride. However, ionic isotonic agents such as sodium chloride cause rapid decomposition of mercury containing preservatives such as Thiomersal. The degree of decomposition is such that there is frequently none of the original preservative remaining a matter of days after the formulation is prepared, whereas the shelf life of such formulations is measured in terms of years.We have now suprisingly found, however, that if, for certain liquid formulations a non ionic polyhydroxy compound is employed as an isotonic agent, then the decomposition of mercury containing preservatives such as Thiomersal is substantially arrested, being comparable to that in simple aqueous media.The invention accordingly provides an isotonic liquid pharmaceutical formulation comprising, trimethoprim and polymyxin as the active ingredients, a vehicle therefor, a mercury containing preservative and, as an isotonic agent, a non ionic polyhydroxy compound.The liquid formulations will be either wholly or partly aqueous in which case the non aqueous part will be any organic solvent s conventionally used in such liquid formulations. The formulation will normally be a solution but other liquid formulations are within the scope of the invention. The invention is particularly applicable to injectable, otic and especially ophthalmic formulations containing trimethoprim and polymyxin. Any suitable mercury containing preservative may be employed, for example those described in United States Patent No. 1,672,615. The preferred preservative is Thiomersal, sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate. Other preservatives include phenyl mercuric nitrate and phenyl mercuric acetate. The preservative should be present in an effective amount which will normally be in the range of 0.1 to 0.0001 w v, preferably less than 0.01 w v, particularly about 0.005 w v.Any non ionic polyhydroxy containing compound i.e. any non ionic compound containing two or more hydroxy groups and which is acceptable as an isotonic agent may be employed. To be acceptable as an isotonic agent, the compound will render a solution isotonic at a concentration of 10 w v or less, preferably 5 w v or less, will not be deleterious to the formulation and will not be deleterious or irritating to the recipient thereof. Suitable isotonic agents for use in the invention include carbohydrate compounds, particularly monomeric compounds such as dextrose, lactose, mannitol and sucrose and, preferably, polyhydric alcohols, such as propylene glycol, glycerol and low molecular weight polyethylene glycols PEGs . By low molecular weight is meant a molecular weight of less than about 750.Reference herein to the formulations being isotonic means the formulations being isotonic with the biological fluid with which the formulation will come into contact. The present invention is particularly concerned with ophthalmic formulations and hence the formulations will be isotonic with lachrymal secretions. Thus an isotonic solution will have an osmotic pressure of from about 270 to 320 milliosmoles per kilogram of water mDsm ka H20 , in particular about 280 300 irosm ka H20 especially about 290 mDsmlka H20.The isotonic agent is preferably not readily metabolised by micro organisms. In addition it is preferred that the isotonic agent is not a nutrient forom√≠cVos 4 organisms. Thus the preferred isotonic agents are polyhydric alcohols, particularly those identified above which in some cases themselves possess antimicrobial activity. The preferred isotonic agent is propylene glycol which renders conventional ophthalmic solutions isotonic with lachrymal secretions at a concentration of about 2.0 w v.The present invention is applicable to any isotonic liquid pharmaceutical formulation containing trimethoprim and polymyxin for example intravenous injections and otic formulations, especially when presented in a multiple dose form. However, it is particularly useful for ophthalmic formulations, such as eyedrops, which are desirably isotonic and in which a preservative is essential as the formulation is generally provided in a multiple dosage form and once opened cannot be maintained in a sterile condition. The trimethoprim and polymyxin may be present in any form in which they are conventionally present in such formulations. In particular they may be present as acid addition salts such as sulphates. The ratio and amounts of trimethoprim to polymyxin may also be that conventionally used in such formulations i.e. from about 0.01 to ig trimethoprim per 1,000 Mega Units polymyxin, in particular about 0.lg trimethoprim per 1,000 Mega Units polymixin.The formulations conveniently contain about Ig litre of trimethoprim and 10,000 Mega Units litre of polymyxin.The formulations of the present invention may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy for the preparation of such formulations, all of which involve the admixture of the active ingredients with the liquid vehicle. The present invention will now be illustrated by the following examples, which in no way should be considered as a limitation of the invention.Example 1 Effect of Sodium Chloride on the Stability of Thiomersal in Aqueous SolutionThiomersal was stored as 0.1 w v , 0.01 w v and 0.001 w v solutions in water and 0.8 w v Saline solution at 50 250 and 500C for up to 15 days. The amount of Thiomersal remaining was assayed by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC after 8 and 15 days.HPLC was carried out using a Cecil CE 210 pump with a 250mm, 4mm i.d. stainless steel column packed with Spherisorb 10 ODS using a mixture of methanol water phosphoric acid 60 50 1 as eluent at a flow rate of 2.6 ml mien 1 and a pressure of 12.5 MPa 1800 psig injection volume 25 ul loop and operating at ambient temperature detection by a Cecil CE 212 variable wavelength u.v. detector at 222 nm.The results are shown in Table 1.

Comparative effect of Isotonic Agents on Thiomersal Stability in Ophthalmic Formulations A series of eye drop formulations containing Thiomersal 0.001 w v in water, trimethoprim sulphate and polymyxin sulphate as active ingredients and an isotonic agent were prepared. The formulations were identical with that described in Example 3 with the exception that the isotonic agents were as indicated in Table 2 below. In one case no isotonic agent was incorporated to provide a control.The amount of each isotonic agent was sufficient to render the formulations isotonic with lachrymatory secretions. The formu lations were stored at 250C for up to six weeks and the Thiomersal content determined as described in Example 1 after 3 days and 1,3 and 6 weeks. The results are shown in Table 2.
