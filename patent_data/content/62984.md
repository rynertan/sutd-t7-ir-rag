# High intensity light source.

## Abstract
A reflective tunnel 2 of rectangular cross section with opposing parallel or converging sides has a light diffuser 12 located at the output opening 2a of the tunnel for integrat ing the light passing therethrough, and a densitometer 3 located near the input opening 2b of the tunnel for measuring the composition of the light within the tunnel. A lamp 14 is positioned at the inner focal point 17i of each of a plurality of dichroic elliptical reflectors 17L, 17R sup ported at the input opening so that light emitted by each lamp is projected into the tunnel directly toward the light diffuser. The lamps are symmetrically disposed about the optical axis of the reflective tunnel and the reflector axes are intersect the tunnel axis at a point 50 located between the midpoint M M of the tunnel and the output P P of the tunnel. Compensating means 25 may be located in a plane defined by the outer focal points 170 of the elliptical reflectors to compensate for variations in the reflector lamp alignment. The light source can provide high intensity light of uniform intensity over the aperture, which is particularly suitable for the exposure of colour photographic prints.
