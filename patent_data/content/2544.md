# Radioimmunological method of determining the thyroid function by an in vitro test in blood serum.

## Abstract
Radioimmunological method for determining the thyroid function in an in vitro test by mixing a blood serum sample with a radio active thyroxine containing solution and with a thyroxine liberating compound, buffering the mixture, adding an antiserum containing thyroxine antibodies for immunoreaction with thyroxine, separating the bound from the unbound thyroxine and determining their relative quantities. After buffering a second sample of the patient s blood serum is added in a given quantity. The corrected thyroxine determination is a good reflection of the quantity of free thyroxine in the bloodserum.
