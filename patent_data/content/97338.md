## Description
REFERENCE VOLTAGE GENERATING DEVICE This invention relates to a reference voltage generating device formed of semiconductors. Sources of reference voltage used hitherto utilize, for example, a forward voltage drop VF of aPN junction diode, a reverse breakdown voltage the zener voltage V of such a junction diode and a threshold voltage Vth of an insulated gate field effect transistor. Further, an insulated gate transistor of the type in which its threshold voltage Vth is structurally equal to the hand gap has been proposed and fabricated already. However, each of the prior art reference voltage sources of the types above described includes various factors causing variations of its output voltage depending on the conditions of its fabrication process and the factors of the process controlling the physical quantities. A prior art reference voltage source of the hand gap type utilizes the threshold voltage difference between an N gate MOS transistor and a P gate MOS transistor, as disclosed in, for example, JapanesePatent Application Laid Open No. 51 149780 IEEE, Vol.SC 15, No. 3 JUNE 1980, pp. 264 269 and DE OS 2951835.Also, a reference voltage source utilizing the threshold voltage difference between an enhancement type MOS transistor and a depletion type MOS transistor is disclosed in a literature such as IEEE, 1978, pp. 50 51. An N gate MOS transistor has a threshold voltage attributable to the doping of its gate layer with a pentavalent doner impurity, while a P gate MOS transistor has a threshold voltage attributable to the doping of its gate layer with a trivalent acceptor impurity. Generally, the trivalent impurity has a large coefficient of diffusion into an oxide film and thus diffuses into the bulk layer directly beneath the gate through a thin oxide film such as a gate oxide film.Therefore, the threshold voltage Vth of the P gate MOS transistor determined depending on the impurity concentration of the bulk layer tends to vary, and the output voltage of the reference voltage source utilizing the P gate MOS transistor tends also to vary or fluctuate. FIG. 1 shows the prior art structure of aP gate MOS transistor and an N gate MOS transistor fabricated according to the silicon gate process. FIG. 2 shows, by way of example, the results of measurement of the threshold voltages Vth of theP gate and N gate MOS transistors shown in FIG. 1 when the gate layer of the P gate MOS transistor was doped with an acceptor impurity such as boron, and the gate layer of the N gate MOS transistor was doped with a doner impurity such as phosphorus. The gate film thickness 500 . It will be seen in FIG. 2 that, according to the results of measurement on eight sampled chips in the same wafer, the values of the threshold voltage Vth are substantially constant in the case of the N gate MOS transistor, while, on the other hand, the values of the threshold voltage Vth are dispersed in the case of the P gate MOS transistor.This is considered to be attributable to the fact that, in the case of the P gate MOS transistor, the acceptor impurity such as boron diffuses into the bulk layer though the gate oxide film thereby causing variations of the threshold voltage Vth of the p gate MOS transistor. To deal with such an undesirable situation, the thickness of the gate oxide film must be made larger than hitherto or an insulator film such as a nitride film must additionally be disposed on the gate oxide film. However, such an additional layer cannot be provided by the same process forming the other circuit portions, and the resultant process alternation leads to an undesirable increase in the cost of fabrication.Further, in view of the future tendency toward fabrication of MOS transistors of finer patterns, the thickness of the gate oxide film will be required to be smaller than hitherto, and in order to meet such a demand, a measure must be taken which can sufficiently suppress threshold voltage variations tending to occur more frequently due to the smaller thickness of the gate oxide film. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a reference voltage generating device which can generate a stable reference voltage substantially free from variations or fluctuations attributable to fabrication process variables in spite of the fact that it is fabricated according to the process customarily employed in this field of art. Another object of the present invention is to provide a reference voltage generating device generating a reference voltage which can be set at any desired level. It is the first feature of the reference voltage generating device of the present invention that it comprises an N type semiconductor and an intrinsic semiconductor both of which are formed of the same semiconductive material, and means for deriving a voltage corresponding to the difference between the Fermi energy levels of these semiconductors. It is the second feature of the reference voltage generating device of the present invention that it comprises a semiconductor of a first conductivity type and a semiconductor of a second conductivity type both of which are formed of the same semiconductive material, means for deriving a voltage corresponding to the difference between the Fermi energy levels of these semiconductors, and means for amplifying the voltage. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the prior art structure of aP gate MOS transistor and an N gate MOS transistor fabricated according to the silicon gate process Fig. 2 is a graph showing, by way of example, the results of measurement of the threshold voltages of the P gate and N gate MOS transistors having the prior art structure shown in Fig. 1 when the gate layer of the P gate MOS transistor is doped with boron, while the gate layer of the N gate MOS transistor is doped with phosphorus Fig. 3 A shows the basic structure of the reference voltage generating device according to the present invention including an N gate MOS transistor whose gate layer is doped with phosphorus and an intrinsic gate MOS transistor whose gate layer is nondoped Fig. 3 B is a graph showing, by way of example, the results of measurement of the threshold voltages of the MOS transistors shown in Fig. 3 A Figs. 4 A and 4 B illustrate the state of energy and the state of charges respectively in a model composed of an N type semiconductor, an insulator and an N type semiconductor Fig. 5 A is a circuit diagram showing the structure of the basic MOS diode circuit of the present invention for deriving the difference between the threshold voltages Vth of two MOS transistors having different threshold voltages Vth respectively Fig. 5 B is a graph showing the VEGS IDES characteristic of the circuit shown in Fig. 5 A Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of an embodiment of the present invention adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by, for example, the factor of 2 according to the basic idea of the present invention Fig. 7 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of another embodiment of the present invention adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of n n an integer in a manner similar to that shown in Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a modification of the embodiment shown inFig. 6 Fig. 9 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a modification of the embodiment shown in Fig..7 Figs. 10 A and 10 B are graphs illustrating the band structure and the Fermi level Ef respectively of an N type semiconductor Fig. 11 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of still another embodiment of the present invention which is additionally provided with the function of temperature compensation Fig. 12 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of yet another embodiment of the present invention which is also provided with the function of temperature compensation and adapted for amplifying the threshoid voltage difference by the factor of 2 Fig. 13 is a graphshowing the VGS ID characteristics of MOS transistors Fig. 14 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a further embodiment of the present invention Fig. 15 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a still further embodiment of the present invention adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of n n an integer Fig. 16 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a yet further embodiment of the present invention adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of any desired value Figs. 17 and 18 are circuit diagrams showing the structure of modifications of the embodiments shown in Figs. 11 and 16, respectively and Fig. 19 is a graph showing the output voltage.characteristic of two models of the present invention relative to variations of the power supply voltage. Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 3 A is a schematic sectional view showing the basic structure of the reference voltage generating device according to the present invention. Referring to Fig. 3 A , the basic structure includes a P channel N gate MOS transistor 301 having a gate electrode 3011 provided by doping a polysilicon layer with phosphorus so that its impurity concentration is preferably in the order of 10 cam to 10 cam , and a P channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 302 having a gate electrode 3021 provided by non doping a polysilicon layer with any impurity. Fig. 3 B is a graph showing, by way of example, the results of measurement of the threshold voltages Vth of these MOS transistor 301 and 302. The numerals 3012 and 3022 designate SiO2 or like gate insulator layers.The term intrinsic is used herein to indicate that the specific layer is not doped with any impurity, and the impurity concentration of that layer is preferably not higher than 10 cmIt will be seen from Fig. 3 B that the threshold voltages Vth of both of the N gate MOS transistor 301 and the intrinsic gate MOS transistor 302 are substantially constant in the same wafer. The reference voltage generating device based on such a basic structure can be fabricated with little fabrication errors and can thus be utilized as a stable reference voltage source. The threshold voltage Vth of such MOS transistors having a semiconductor gate electrode will be described with reference to Figs. 4 A and 4 B .In the case of the N gate MOS transistor 301 shown inFig. 3A, the following equation holds as will be apparent from the energy band diagram of Fig. 4 A EMI9.1 where VG potential difference between N type semi conductor substrate 303 and gate electrode N type semiconductor X electron affinity Eq energy gap surface potential of N type semiconductor substrate 303 Fermi Fermi potential of N type semiconductor substrate 303 when Fermi potential of N type semiconductor is taken as reference Fermi potential of N type semiconductor sub strate 303 when Fermi potential of intrinsic semiconductor is taken as reference unit charge of electrons V0 potential difference applied across insulator Ec lower limit of energy level of conduction band Ev upper limit of energy level of valence band Eii Fermi level of intrinsic semiconductor When, in the equation 1 , the work function of the gate electrode 3011 of the N gate MOS transistor 301 is expressed by the potential MN , and the work function of the semiconductor is similarly expressed by the potential fsi the following equation 2 holds MN X Eq 2q FN .............. 2 Since si is given by E si X 2q F ................. 3 V0 is expressed as follows V0 VG M si s .......... 4 Further, from the relation of the charges shown in Fig. 4 B , the following equation 5 holds COX VO Qss Qi QB 0 ..... 5 where COX capacitance of insulator per unit area QSS fixed charges in insulator QB fixed charges produced by ionization of impurity in semiconductor substrate Qi carriers formed as channel.

In the case of the intrinsic gate MOS transistor 302 too, similar equations hold except the work function Mi of its gate electrode 3021. The work function Mi is expressed as follows E Mi X 2q Fi Therefore, the threshold voltage Vthi of the MOS transsistor 302 is given byEMI11.1 In this case, s 2 F. Consequently, the threshold voltage difference Vthi Vthn between the N gate MOS transistor 301 and the intrinsic gate MOS transistor 302 is expressed as Vthi Vthn Mi MN Fi FN ................ 9 Thus, the threshold voltage difference is equal to the difference between the Fermi potentials of the semiconductors forming the gate electrodes of the MOS transistors 301 and 302. Description will then be directed to means for deriving the difference between the threshold voltagesVth of such MOS transistors. Although a circuit which will be described below can be used as one of means for deriving theFermi level difference IEi Evi described above, such a circuit can generally be applied to a reference voltage generating device in which the voltage corresponding to the threshold voltage difference between FET s having different threshold voltages Vth is utilized to provide the reference voltage. Fig. 5 A is a circuit diagram of a circuit generating a voltage corresponding to the difference between the threshold voltages of MOS transistors, andFig. 5 B is a graph showing the VGS IDS characteristic of the circuit shown in Fig. 5 A . Referring to Fig. 5 A , MOS FET s TN and T.having different threshold voltages Vthn and Vthi respectively but being substantially equal to each other in their mutual conductance ss are each connected at the drain and gate in common to constitute so calledMOS diodes. The symbol 10 designates a constant current source to which each MOS FET is connected, and VN and V. designate the drain voltages of the MOS ipFET S TN and Ti respectively. Since Io is expressed as I0 ss VN Vthn 2 ss Vip Vthi 2 ............... 10 the drain voltages VN and V. of the MOS FET s TN and Ip T. are expressed as follows respectively EMI13.1 Therefore, the difference between the threshold voltagesVthn and Vthi can be obtained by taking the difference between the drain voltages VN and Vip. The constant current source Io may be a resistor having a sufficiently high resistance.Provided that the resistance characteristic is uniform, the constant current source I0 may be a diffused resistor, a polycrystalline silicon resistor, a resistor made by ion implantation or a resistor utilizing a MOS transistor. Thus, when the aforementioned N gate MOS transistor 301 and intrinsic gate MOS transistor 302 are used in place of these MOS transistors TN and T.respectively in the circuit shown in Fig. 5 A , theFermi level difference IEi Ev between the N type semiconductor and the intrinsic semiconductor, which difference is substantially equal to the threshold voltage difference, can be derived from the circuit shown in Fig. 5 A . The above description has referred to the circuit for deriving the difference between the threshold voltage Vth of the MOS transistor TNt and that Vth of the MOS transistor Ti. However, the value of the derived threshold voltage Vth difference is small as shown in Fig. 3 B . A method for amplifying the threshold voltage Vth difference by the factor of n n an integer and utilizing such an amplified voltage as a reference voltage will now be described. As described already, threshold voltages Vth of silicon gate MOS transistors or an N gate MOS transistor and an intrinsic gate MOS transistor formed in the same wafer do not vary or fluctuate substantially, and a reference voltage generating circuit utilizing the threshold voltage difference between the N gate MOS transistor and the intrinsic gate MOS transistor can provide a stable output voltage. However, the level of the output voltage from such a reference voltage generating circuit is low compared with that of a reference voltage generating circuit utilizing the threshold voltage difference between a P gate MOS transistor and an N gate MOS transistor. Therefore, the output voltage from the MOS transistor pair is amplified by the factor of n n an integer , that is, by providing.n pairs of N gate MOS transistors and intrinsic gateMOS transistors in the circuit to utilize the threshold voltage difference in each pair. Fig. 6 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of an embodiment of the present invention adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of 2 according to the basic idea of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 6, a P channel MOS transistor 10 is connected at its source to the positive terminal 1 of a power source of the reference voltage generating circuit. An N channel N gate MOS transistor 11 is connected at its drain and gate to the gate and drain respectively of the P channel MOS transistor 10, and another N channel N gate MOS transistor 12 is connected at its drain and gate to the drain and source respectively of the N channel N gate MOS transistor 11 and at its source to the negative power supply terminal.Another P channel MOS transistor 20 is connected at its source to the positive power supply terminal 1 and at its gate to the gate of the P channel MOS transistor 10.An N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 21 is connected at its drain and gate to the drain of theP channel MOS transistor 20, and another N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22 is connected at its drain and gate to the drain and source respectively of the N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 21 and at its source to the negative power supply terminal. Let V1 be the drain source voltage of theN channel N gate MOS transistor 12 in the arrangement of the MOS transistors 10, 11 and 12. Current I1 flowing through this N channel N gate MOS transistor 12 is given by I1 ssOn ss12 V1 Vthn Vthn 2 ssOn ss12 V1 2V hn 2 ....... 13 where sson channel conductance constant of N channel N gate MOS transistor 12 dimension ratio channel width channel length of N channel N gate MOS transistor 12 Vthn threshold voltage of N channel N gate MOS transistor 12. On the other hand, current I2 flowing through the N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22 is given by I2 ssOn ss22 V2 Vthi Vthi 2 ssOn ss22 V2 2Vthi 2 ......... 14 where dimension ratio of N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22 Vthi threshold voltage of N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22 V2 drain source voltage of N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22.Since the N channel MOS transistors 11 and 22 have the same gate voltage, the currents I1 and I2 are equal to each other. The drain source voltages V1 and V2 of theMOS transistors 12 and 22 are computed from the equations 13 and 14 as follows respectively EMI17.1 Suppose that the dimension ratios ss12 and ss22 are equal to each other, then, the following equation 17 holds V1 V2 2 Vthn Vthi .......... 17 Thus, the drain voltage difference V1 V2 between the N gate MOS transistors 11, 12 and the intrinsicgate MOS transistors 21, 22 provides a voltage equal to the factor of 2 amplified threshold voltage difference. Fig. 7 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of another embodiment of the present invention adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of n n an integer . As in the case of Fig. 6, diode connected N channel N gateMOS transistors are connected between N channelN gate MOS transistors 11 and 12 to provide a total of n, and diode connected N channel intrinsic gateMOS transistors are connected between N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistors 21 and 22 to provide a total of n.The difference between the drain source voltages V1 and V2, of the N gate MOS transistor 12 and intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22 is expressed as follows V1 V2 n Vthn Vthi ........ 18 Thus, the threshold voltage difference between the gate MOS transistor 11 and the intrinsic gate MOS transistor 21 can be amplified by the factor of n. Therefore, the method shown in Fig. 7 can be used for providing a reference voltage which is n n an integer times as high as the threshold voltage difference between the N gate MOS transistor 11 and the intrinsic gate MOS transistor 21. Although the circuits of C MOS structure including P channel MOS transistors acting as an active load combined withN channel N gate MOS transistors and N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistors have been described with reference to Figs. 6 and 7, by way of example, it is apparent that such a reference voltage can be similarly generated by the combination of P channel N gate MOS transistors and P channel intrinsic gate MOS transistors.It is also apparent that single channel MOS transistors only may be similarly effectively used. Embodiments shown in Figs. 8 and 9 correspond to or are modifications of those shown in Figs. 6 and 7 respectively. The modifications shown in Figs. 8 and 9 are adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference between an N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistor and an N channel N gate MOS transistor by the factors of 2 and n respectively. Thus, in the case of Fig. 8, the individual MOS transistors are diode connected in two stages, while, in the case of Fig. 9, they are diode connected in n stages. The numerals 110 in Fig. 8 and lin, 120 inFig. 9 designate N channel N gate MOS transistors, and the numerals 210 in Fig. 8 and 21n, 220 in Fig. 9 designate N channel intrinsic gate MOS transistors.The numerals 100 and 200 in each of Figs. 8 and 9 designate P channel MOS transistors of current mirror arrangement as in the case of Figs. 6 and 7. According to the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the MOS transistors 120 and 220 are connected at their drains to the sources of the MOS transistors 110 and 210 respectively, so that the MOS transistors 120 and 220 are not adversely affected by the drift that may occur in the MOS transistors 110 and 2i0. Therefore, this embodiment is advantageous in that the operating characteristic of the reference voltage generating circuit can be stabilized. The same applies also to the embodiment shown in Fig. 9. An energy level model of an N type semiconductor and its temperature characteristic are shown in Figs. 10 A and 10 B respectively. The carrier in such a semiconductor is electrons nd ionized from a doner impurity Nd and pairs of electrons and holes excited from the valence band.When the amount of the doner impurity Nd is sufficiently large, the excited electron hole pairs can be neglected, and the number n of conduction electrons can be approximated as n . nd. As is well known, Nd can be computed from the probability of the number of electrons trapped at the doner level, and n can be computed from the number of electrons present in the conduction hand, as follows EMI20.1 EMI21.1 whereEMI21.2 h Planck s constant m effective mass of electronTherefore, the following equation holds EMI21.3 And, Nd Ne is expressed as follows EMI21.4 Since it is now assumed that the Fermi level is close to the position of the level Ec, the first term in the equation 23 in the right hand members in the equation 23 can be neglected, and the following equation 24 holds EMI22.1 This equation 24 indicates that, when the impurity concentration Nd is high not only at a low temperature but also at the room temperature, the ratio N Nd approaches unity 1 to set up the relation N Qn N 0 Therefore, the Fermi level is situated intermediate between the lower limit E c of the conduction band and the doner level Ed, and the temperature dependence becomes substantially equal to the temperature characteristic of Ec. However, when the temperature becomes sufficiently high, many pairs of electrons and holes are excited from the valence band to reduce the effect of the impurity, so that the Fermi level approaches the level Ei of the intrinsic semiconductor. The above relation is graphically shown inFig. 10 B . When, for example, phosphorus P is used as an impurity to be doped in an N type semiconductor in a process for fabricating S. semiconductor integrated circuits, the temperature dependent change of the difference EFN EFi between the Fermi level of the N type semiconductor and that of the intrinsic semiconductor is about 0.52 eV to 0.43 eV within the temperature range of 200 K to 400 K 700C to 1300C . Thus, the change rate is about 0.45 mV C 450 ppm C , and this means that the change rate has a large temperature dependence. Therefore, a compensation circuit which will be described now is required to ensure generation of a stable reference voltage. A reference voltage generating circuit of the band gap type is advantageous over a reference voltage generating circuit of the type utilizing the threshold.voltage of a MOS transistor or the forward voltage drop of a diode in that the temperature dependent change of its operating characteristic is less than that of the latter. However, the temperature dependence of such a reference voltage generating cirduit becomes a matter of consideration when such a circuit is incorporated in, for example, a high accuracy analog circuit. Fig. 11 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of still another embodiment of the present invention. That is, Fig. 11 shows one form of the reference voltage generating circuit of the band gap type which is provided with the function of temperature compensation. In Fig. 11, the numerals 1 to 22 designate the same parts as those appearing in Fig. 6 except the ground terminals of the N channel MOS transistors 12 and 22. Referring to Fig. 11, a P channel MOS transistor 30 is connected at its source to the positive power supply terminal 1. An N channel N gate MOS transistor 31 is connected at its drain and gate to the drain and gate of the P channel MOS transistor 30 respectively.An N channel N gate MOS transistor 32 is connected at its drain to the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 30 and at its gate to the source of the N gate MOS transistor 31. An N channel MOS transistor 33 is connected at its drain to the source of the N gateMOS transistor 32 and at its source to the negative power supply terminal. A bias voltage input terminal 35 is connected to the gate of the N channel MOS transistor 33. Another N channel MOS transistor 40 is connected at its drain to the sources of the N gate and intrinsic gate MOS transistors 12 and 22, at its gate to the bias voltage input terminal 35 and at its source to the negative power supply terminal. When now a bias voltage VB is applied to the bias voltage input terminal 35, currents 133 and I40 as shown below flow through the N channel MOS transistors 33 and 40 respectively 133 2 On ss33 VB Vthn 2 ........ 25 I40 ssOn ss40 VB Vthn 2 .......... 26 where ss33 ss40 dimension ratios of respective N channel MOS transistors 33 and 40 Vthn threshold voltage of N channel MOS transistors 33 and 40The ratio between 133 and 140 is 1 2 when the ratio between a33 and a40 is selected to be 1 2. That is, the value of constant current flowing through the N channel MOS transistor 33 is one half the value of constant current flowing through the N channel MOS transistor 40, or the relation 2I33 I40 holds in this case. The drain voltage VD1 appearing at the drain.of the N gate MOS transistor 12 provides the gate voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 30 and Nchannel MOS transistor 31, and the current Il flowing through the N channel N gate MOS transistors 31, 32 and P channel MOS transistor 30 is given by I1 ssOp ssp VD1 VDD Vthp 2 ... 27 1 2 2 pOn pn D1 2 thn .... 20 wheressp, ssn dimension ratios of respective p channel MOS transistor 30 and n gate transistors 31, 32.From these two equations 27 and 28 , the drain voltageVDl of the N gate MOS transistor 12 is computed as follows EMI26.1 6 29 On the other hand, since the gate voltages of the P channel MOS transistors 10 and 20 are equal to each other, the current flowing through the N gateMOS transistor 12 is equal to that flowing through the intrinsic gate MOS transistor 22, and the sum of these currents flows through the N channel MOS transistor 40. When the relation between the current flowing through the N channel MOS transistor 33 and that flowing through the N channel MOS transistor 40 is selected to be 1 2 as described above, the currents flowing through the N gate MOS transistors 12 and 32 are equal to each other, and the drain voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 30 is also equal to VD1. That is, the input and output voltages of the circuit composed of the MOS transistors 30 to 33 are equal to each other, and such a relation establishes the most stable state. Another P channel MOS transistor 36 is connected at its source to the positive power supply terminal 1, at its gate to the drain of the N gate MOS transistor 31 and at its drain to the gate of the P channel MOS transistor 10. Another N channel N gateMOS transistor 37 is connected at its drain and gate to the drain and gate of the P channel MOS transistor 36 respectively. Another N channel N gate MOS transistor 38 is connected at its drain to the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 36 and at its gate to the source of the N gate MOS transistor 37. AnotherN channel MOS transistor 39 is connected at its drain to the source of the N gate MOS transistor 38, at its gate to the bias voltage input terminal 35 and at its source to the negative power supply terminal. The combination of the MOS transistors 36 to 39 operates in a manner similar to the operation of the aforementioned combination of the MOS transistors 30 to 33, and the current flowing through the N channelMOS transistor 39 is equal to that flowing through theN channel MOS transistor 33. Therefore, for the same reason described for the combination of the MOS transistors 30 to 33, the drain voltage of the P channelMOS transistor 36 is equal to the drain source voltage VD1 of the N gate MOS transistor 12. When a temperature variation is taken into consideration, the equation 17 is rewritten as follows V1 V2 2 Vthn Vthi 2 AVthn T .............. 30 In the above equation 30 , 2 Athn T is the term indicative of the temperature variation of the N gateMOS transistors, and, ideally, V1 V2 in the circuit including the intrinsic gate MOS transistors 21 and 22 is expressed by the equation 30 since these intrinsicgate MOS transistors are not affected by a temperature variation. When now the temperature rises, the threshold voltage level of the N gate MOS transistor 12 is lowered to reduce the gate voltage of the N gate MOS transistor, and, at the same time, the on state resistance of the P channel MOS transistor 30 is decreased to raise the drain voltage of the P channelMOS transistor 30. Due to this rise in the drain voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 30, the gate voltages of the P channel MOS transistor 36 and N gate MOS transistor 37 having been stabilized at VD1 are raised to increase the on state resistance of the P channelMOS transistor 36, with the result that the drain voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 36 drops by the amount corresponding to the temperature variation, and the resultant voltage variation is applied to the gate of theP channel MOS transistor 10.Due to the drop of the gate voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 10, its on state resistance decreases to increase the current supplied to the N gate MOS transistor 12 thereby raising the drain voltage thereof. Thus, the variation of the threshold voltage Vth attributable to the temperature rise can be compensated. When, on the other hand, the temperature drops, the value of EVthn of the N gate MOS transistor 12 increases to increase the drain voltage thereof. As a result of such a voltage variation, the gate voltages of the N gate MOS transistor 31 and Pchannel MOS transistors 30 are raised to increase the on state resistance of the P channel MOS transistor 30. As a result cf such a resistance variation, the drain voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 30 drops to cause a corresponding drop of the gate voltages of the P channel MOS transistor 30 and N gate MOS transistor 37 having been stabilized at VD1.Due to such a voltage variation, the on state resistance of the P channel MOS transistor 36 decreases to raise the drain voltage thereof, and the on state resistance of the P channel MOS transistor 10 increases with the rise of the gate voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 10. Consequently, the current flowing through theN gate MOS transistor 12 decreases, and its drain voltage drops to compensate the variation of Vthnf attributable to the temperature drop. Fig. 12 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of yet another embodiment of the present invention. That is, Fig. 12 shows another form of the reference voltage generating circuit which is provided with the function of temperature compensation and adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of 2. Referring to Fig. 12, a gate bias voltage is applied from a bias voltage input terminal 350 to the gates of MOS transistors 330, 390 and 400, and the value of current flowing through the MOS transistor 400 is two times as large as that flowing through each of the MOS transistors 330 and 390. The structure shown in Fig. 12 is based on that shown in Fig. 8 and differs from that shown in Fig. 11. The embodiment shown inFig. 12 has a higher degree of freedom than that shown in Fig. 11 in regard to the function of temperature compensation. It is apparent that the principle of temperature compensation in Fig. 12 is similar to that described with reference to Fig. 11. Fig. 13 is a graph showing the VGS ID characteristics of MOS transistors to illustrate the function of temperature compensation in Fig. 12 from the aspect of the MOS characteristics. In Fig. 13, the characteristic curve A represents the characteristic of an intrinsic gate MOS transistor, the characteristic curve B represents the characteristic of an N gate MOS transistor, and the characteristic curve C indicates how the characteristic of the N gate MOS transistor is shifted under influence of temperature. In the absence of any influence of temperature, the threshold voltage difference at a drain current ID1 that is, the voltage difference Vb Va in Fig. 12 is AV1. In the presence of a temperature variation, the characteristic of the N gate MOS transistor is shifted from the curve B to the curve C under influence of temperature, and the voltage difference Vb Va increases to EV2 from AV1. Since the threshold voltage level of the N gate MOS transistor is lowered under the above situation, more current can now flow therethrough, and the current value flowing through the N gate MOS transistor changes to ID2 from ID1. Thus, the threshold voltage difference is now practically determined by 1D1 on the characteristic curve A and ID2 on the characteristic curve C so that the voltage difference Vb V Va approaches bVi representing the value of voltage appearing in the absence of any temperature variation. Fig. 14 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a further embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 14, the numerals 1 to 40 designate the same parts as those appearing in Fig. 11. Referring to Fig. 14, a P channel MOS transistor 60 is connected at its source to the positive supply terminal 1 and at its gate to its drain.An N channel MOS transistor 61 is connected at its drain to the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 60 and to the gate of the N channel MOS transistor 33, at its gate to its drain and at its source to the negative power supply terminal. Another P channel MOS transistor 70 is connected at its source to the positive power supply terminal 1 and at its gate to the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 20. Another N channel MOS transistor 71 is connected at its drain to the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 70, at its gate to the drain of the N channel MOS transistor 61 and at its source to the negative power supply terminal. The numeral 80 designates a reference voltage output terminal in this embodiment of the present invention. The P channel MOS transistor 60 and the Nchannel MOS transistor 61 constitute a bias circuit.Current 160 flowing through the P channel MOS transistor 60 in its saturation region is expressed as follows I60 ssOp ss60 VB VDD Vthp 2 .... 31 where ss60 dimension ratio of P channel MOS transistor 60 VB drain voltage of P channel MOS transistor 60 Vthp threshold voltage of P channel MOS transistor 60 Similarly, current I61 flowing through theN channel MOS transistor 61 is expressed as follows 161 ssOn ss61 VB Vthn 2 32 where ss61 dimension ratio of N channel MOS transistor 61 Vthn threshold voltage of N channel MOS transistor 61 From the relation I60 161, the drain voltage VB of the P channel MOS transistor 60 is expressed as follows EMI33.1 Therefore, any desired bias voltage VB can be obtained by suitably selecting the dimension ratios of the Pchannel MOS transistor 60 and N channel MOS transistor 61. The P channel MOS transistor 70 and N channelMOS transistor 71 constitute a buffer circuit, and the gate voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 70 varying depending on the threshold voltage difference changes the on state resistance of this MOS transistor 70 so that an output voltage corresponding to the gate voltage of the P channel MOS transistor 70 is generated.In Fig. 14, this output voltage appears across the output terminal 80 and the positive power supply terminal 1. Fig. 15 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a still further embodiment of the present invention in which the threshold voltage difference between an N gate MOS transistor and an intrinsic gateMOS transistor is utilized to amplify it by the factor of n n an integer to provide such a reference voltage.Actually, the structure shown in Fig. 15 is the combination of those shown in Figs. 7 and 14. Thus, such an embodiment of the present invention provides the following advantages 1 A reference voltage source substantially free from output voltage variations attributa ble to process variables can be provided, and it generates an output voltage which is n times n an integer as high as the threshold voltage difference between an N gate MOS transistor and an intrinsic gate MOS transistor. Therefore, the applicable range of the reference voltage source in IC s can be widened. 2 A temperature compensation circuit minimizes the influence of temperature varia tions in such a reference voltage source of the band gap type so that the reference voltage source of the band gap type can operate without being appreciably affected by the temperature variation. It will thus be seen that the embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 15 can provide an output voltage which is n times n an integer as high as the threshold voltage difference between an gate MOS transistor and an intrinsic gate MOS transistor. A arbitrary reference voltage output corresponding to a given threshold voltage difference can be provided by a structure as shown in Fig. 16. Fig. 16 is a circuit diagram showing the structure of a yet further embodiment of the present invention in which the threshold voltage difference between an N gate MOS transistor and an intrinsic gateMOS transistor arranged in pair is utilized to obtain any desired reference voltage and in which the numerals 1 to 71 designate the same functional parts as those explained with reference to Fig. 14. Referring to Fig. 16, an operational amplifier 100 is connected at its plus input terminal to the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 70. A resistor R1 is connected at one end thereof to the minus input terminal of the operational amplifier 100 and at the other end thereof to the negative power supply terminal. Another resistor R2 is connected at one end thereof to the minus input terminal of the operational amplifier 100 and at the other end thereof to the output terminal of the operational amplifier 100. The output voltage VO appearing at the output terminal 101 of the operational amplifier 100 is expressed as follows V0 1 R2 R1 Vin ................. 36 where V. is the drain voltage of the P channel MOS in transistor 70. The output voltage of the reference voltage source structure shown in Fig. 16 appears also across the positive power supply terminal 1 and the drain of the P channel MOS transistor 70. Figs. 17 and 18 are circuit diagrams showing the structure of other forms of the reference voltage source based on the structure of Fig. 9 and adapted for amplifying the threshold voltage difference by the factor of n n an integer . That is, the basis idea of connecting the drain of a succeeding MOS transistor to the source of a preceding MOS transistor as described with reference to the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, which basic idea is also applied to the embodiment shown inFig. 9 is also applied to the embodiments shown inFigs. 17 and 18. Therefore, the embodiments shown inFigs. 17 and 18 are modifications of those shown inFigs. 11 and 16 respectively. The output voltage Vo appearing at the output terminal 1010 of an operational amplifier 1000 in Fig. 18 is expressed as follows V0 R2 R1 Vb Va Fig. 19 is a graph showing the power supply voltage output voltage characteristics of two trial fabricated models of the reference voltage source of the present invention utilizing the threshold voltage difference. The structure shown in the lower part of Fig. 19 includes a pair of an N gate MOS transistor and an intrinsic gate MOS transistor, while that shown in the upper part includes two pairs of such transistors Fig. 14 . However, the models do not include the temperature compensation circuit.It will be seen in Fig. 19 that Vref V1 V2 varies only within the range of 15 mV the range defined between the two lines in each case even when the power supply voltage VDD varies between 4.5 V and 5.5 V. More precisely, even when the power supply voltage VDD varies between 4.5 V and 5.5 V, it will be apparent from Fig. 19 that the output voltage of the circuit shqwn in the lower part of Fig. 19 is maintained stable at about 0.55 V. In the case of the lower part circuit which provides the output voltage two times as high as that of the upper part circuit, it will be also apparent from Fig. 19 that the output voltage is maintained quite stable regardless of variations of the power supply voltage VDD. It will be understood from the foregoing detailed description of various embodiments and modifications of the present invention that a reference voltage source of the band gap type capable of generation of any desired stable reference voltage can be provided regardless of whether it is of a C MOS structure or of a single channel MOS structure, so that an IC including a built in on chip reference voltage source capable of operation with high accuracy can be fabricated. According to the reference voltage source of the present invention, a stable reference voltage substantially free from voltage variations attributable to process variables can be fabricated by the usual fabrication process. Also, according to the present invention, the reference voltage can be set at any desired level.
