# Silicon on insulator transistors.

## Abstract
A shared element semiconductor structure in which the insulating layer of a silicon on insulator structure is pattern ed to form a gate oxide 40 . The bulk semiconductor 24 underlying the insulating layer 40 is defined into an FET field effect transistor with its gate region below the gate oxide. The epitaxial layer above the insulating layer 40 is defined into another FET with its drain region 60 above the gate oxide 40 , whereby the drain region 60 also operates as the gate electrode for the bulk FET. Also described is a method of forming a silicon on insulator substrate with insulating layer usable as a gate oxide by means of bonding a silicon substrate to an oxidized epitaxial layer on another silicon seed substrate and then removing the seed sub strate.
