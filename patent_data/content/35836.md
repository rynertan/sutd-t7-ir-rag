# Shape selective reactions with alkaline earth metal modified zeolite catalysts.

## Abstract
A process for the conversion of aromatic compounds to dialkylbenzene compounds rich in the 1,4 dialkylbenzene isomer. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a particu lar type of zeolite catalyst having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of about 1 12, said catalyst having been modified by treatment with compounds of the alkaline earth metals Ca, Sr, Ba , and optionally phosphorus, to deposit a minor proportion of such elements on the zeolite.
