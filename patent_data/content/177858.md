# Ultrasonic coagulation monitor and method.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic coagulation monitor for measurement of prothrombin times and related coagulation times includes at least one piezoelectric crystal 24 operated at a fixed fre quency near its resonant frequency. A sample 38 of material to be analyzed is placed in acoustic communication with the crystal 24 . The voltage across the crystal is monitored in or der to detect a voltage change, preferably a drop, that occurs upon coagulation of the sample. A timer is included that is turned off at a predetermined voltage drop corresponding to a particular stage of coagulation desired to be timed. In an al ternative embodiment of the invention a second crystal is in cluded and is mounted a predetermined distance from the first crystal to define a cavity therebetween. One crystal is driven by the frequency oscillator circuit and the material the coagula tion of which is to be measured is placed in the cavity. A volt age sensing device senses the voltage across the second crystal and controls a timer as in the first embodiment. A method of monitoring prothrombin times and related coagula tion times is also described. The method includes placing coag ulating material in sound absorbing relationship with at least one piezoelectric crystal, driving that crystal at a fixed fre quency using a fixed frequency oscillator circuit, measuring the voltage in the circuit and determining the amount of time required for the voltage to reach a predetermined voltage level.
