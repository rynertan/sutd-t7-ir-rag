The lower surface of the impact frame preferably includes a front slope and a rear slope which improve shock impact and step characteristics in the foot and are important in specifically preventing and alleviating symptoms of laminitis and navicular disease in horses. An alternate toe in, toe out shoe is adapted for correction of unbalanced hoof conditions. The therapeutic horseshoe and the toe in, toe out shoe are ideal for use by horse professionals such as farriers, veterinarians and trainers. The shoes are also usable on healthy horses as a preventive measure against causes of lameness and as a racing speed enhancement.
