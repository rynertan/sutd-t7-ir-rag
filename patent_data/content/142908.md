# VALVE DEVICE INCORPORATING A SWITCHING MECHANISM

## Abstract
The invention comprises an improved override and an interrelated valve system. A valve apparatus has a valve body which mounts a valve element for movement between positions opening and closing the flowway through the valve body. The override is associated with the valve element and is selectively shiftable between an engaged mode in which the override is operatively connected with the valve element for moving the valve element between its open and closed positions, and a disengaged mode in which the operative connection between the override and the valve element is interrupted, whereby the valve element may move indepen dently of the override. The override preferably may include a housing, a driven gear in the housing connected to the valve element, a clutch shaft mounted in the housing for rotation about its own axis, a drive shaft rotatably mounted in the clutch shaft, with the axis of the drive shaft parallel to but eccentrically spaced from the axis of the clutch shaft, and a drive gear generally opposed to the driven gear and coaxially carried by the drive shaft for rotation therewith. By rotation of the eccentric clutch shaft, the two gears may be engaged and disengaged.
