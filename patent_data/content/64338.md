# Coating compositions capable of curing at room temperature based on a hydroxyl group containing addition polymer, an alkylated melamine formaldehyde crosslinking agent and a blend of specified alkylated arylsulphonic acids as catalyst.

## Abstract
Coating compositions capable of curing at or near to room temperature comprise 90 50 by weight of a specified hydroxyl group containing addition polymer, 10 50 by weight of an alkylated melamine formaldehyde crosslinking agent and an acid catalyst consisting of a blend of a C₁ ₄ alkylated arylsulphonic acid and a C₈ ₁₄ alkylated arylsulphonic acid in amounts such that the SO₃H group content is 0.70 2.1 of the total weight of the addition polymer and the crosslinking agent. The compositions are particularly suitable for the refinishing of automobile bodies.
