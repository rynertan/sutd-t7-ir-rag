# Steering wheel assembly.

## Abstract
A steering wheel assembly having an energy absorbing sleeve 13 supported on a hub 12 and a steering wheel 14 supported on the sleeve. The energy absorbing sleeve has a plurality of concentric, substantially rectangular rings 19 formed in stepped relationship to provide essentially crush force throughout its range of usable crush. The steering wheel 14 comprises an armature 15 forming a housing 22 for the energy absorbing sleeve, the upper end of the housing being complementary to the rectangular configuration of the sleeve. The armature further has an annular rim core 24 and a plurality of spokes 25 extending from the housing to the rim core. The housing 22 , the spokes 25 and the rim core 24 are integrally moulded of plastic, preferably a polycarbonate selected for its impact strength over a wide temperature range.
