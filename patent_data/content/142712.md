# Control apparatus for multi jointed arm mechanism.

## Abstract
In a control apparatus for a multi jointed arm mechanism having a plurality of arm elements 1 9 , to the end of enhanc ing the operating speed of each arm element, a true control error between a fore end 9 of the arm element and a target position 10 thereof, resulting from a movement of the arm element, and a predicted control error thereof have their dif ference evaluated, and the arm element is controlled so as to make the difference zero.
