## Description
This invention relates to a light reflection type encoding method and a light reflection type encoder. More particularly, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for encoding the kinetic variation to be detected of the subject under detection by optical signals, through the motion of a mobile body which modes in response to the motion of said subject, by emitting light from one end of an optical fiber or a bundle of optical fibers which will be hereinafter referred to simply as an optical fiber on a mobile body, which moves in response to the kinetic variation to be detected of the subject under detection, and receiving the light reflected by the mobile body at the same end of said optical fiber. Heretofore most generally employed encoders composed of a graduated board and electronic parts such as light emitting and light receiving elements have a number of drawbacks. Known encoders are easily adversely affected by electric noise, temperature and humidity incapable of precise measurement require anti fire and anti explosion provisions if used in equipment around which fire must be avoided and are not usable for long distance signal transmission because of the voltage drop or electric distortion. An optical encoder has been proposed, in which the pulse output caused by moving graduations is converted to optical signals, in an attempt to eliminate such drawbacks of conventional encoders in which the pulse output is electric signals. Japanese Official Patent Gazette, Publication No. 52640 82, discloses an optical encoder comprising a luminous source emitting two phase rectangular waves having a mutual phase difference of 90 In the optical encoder disclosed in said Publication No. 52640 82 as above, however, optical fibers must be disposed at both front and back of the disc to receive the light beams emitted from the luminous source, which in turn makes it necessary to install near the disc a means for mechanically connecting the disc with the subject under detection, so that said disc can move in relation to the motion of said subject. Installation of such a means causes difficulties. Furthermore, because the prior art encoder requires a means for receiving both the emitted light and transmitted light, it can neither be miniaturized nor can it perform precise measurement of the subject s motion. US A 4162399 discloses an optical encoder with a mobile body with alternate groups of graduations with different reflective characteristics, a light source connected to optical fibers which emit light onto the body and a detctor connected to other optical fibers which receive the reflected light from the body. EP A 007685 discloses an optical encoder of the light transmitting type in which a rotary body with slits receives light from optical fibers, the light transmitted through the slits passes through a fixed lattice plate with slits and the transmitted light is received by other optical fibers. JP A 56087818 Laid Open Patent Publication No. 87,818 81 discloses a light reflection type encoder. In this encoder a mobile body is provided with graduations or indicia which reflect incident light from an optical fiber. The same optical fiber receives light reflected by the indicia and an interferometric device compares the emitted and reflected light. The encoder disclosed in JP A 56087818 has the following drawbacks. In order to detect the variation in the light reflectivity to precisely determine the position of the body the emitted light must have a beam width less than that of the individual graduations. If the width of the graduations is narrowed to improve the precision, the width of the optical fiber for projecting light on the graduations must also be narrowed and also the distance between the end of the optical fiber and the moving body must be precisely controlled to regulate the extremely fine light emitted area. As the width of the optical fiber is reduced, however, the tramission of an effective quantity of light becomes more difficult, increasing the difficulty in precise positional detection. Again, when the graduation width is drastically narrowed, it becomes difficult or impossible to provide identical width, form and reflectivity to all of the great number of graduations which obviously renders the precise positional detection difficult. An object of the present invention is provide an improved light reflection type encoding method and an encoder, adopting a system wherein the light is emitted from one end of an optical fiber to light reflective graduations on a mobile body which moves relatively to said optical fiber and the same optical fiber end receives the reflected light. In accordance with the invention, and as is known from JP A 56087818, there is provided a light reflection encoding method for detecting motion comprising emitting light from an optical fiber end onto a body, said body and said end of the optical fiber being relatively movable to produce the motion to be detected, said body including a plurality of graduations arranged in alternate groups exhibiting light reflection characteristics differentiated from one another, receiving light reflected by one of the groups of graduations of the body with the same optical fiber end and detecting said received light with a photo electric converter. In contrast to JP A 56087818, the invention is characterised in that the optical fiber end emits light onto at least two adjacent graduations of said one group of graduations of the body and by an optical lattice is interposed between the optical fiber end and the body and in a fixed position relative to the optical fiber end, the lattice including a plurality of graduations arranged in alternate groups exhibiting light transmissive characteristics differentiated from one another, the graduations of the lattice being capable of superposing optically and regularly with the graduations of the body to modulate light reflected by said at least adjacent graduations of the body. Further in accordance with the invention and as is known from JP A 56087818, there is provided a light reflection type encoder for detecting motion which comprises an optical fiber for emitting light from one end, a body for receiving the emitted light, the body and the optical fiber being relatively movable to produce the motion to be detected, the body including a plurality of graduations arranged in alternate groups exhibiting light reflective characteristics differentiated from one another and photoelectric conversion means for detecting light reflected by one of the groups of graduations of the body and received by the same end of the optical fiber. In contrast to JP A 56087818, the invention is characterised in that the light emitted by the optical fiber end is incident on at least two adjacent graduations of said one group of graduations of the body and an optical lattice is interposed between the optical fiber end and the body and in fixed position relative to the optical fiber end, the lattice including a plurality of graduations arranged in alternate groups exhibiting light transmissive characteristics differentiated from one another, the graduations of the lattice being capable of superposing optically and regularly with the graduations of the body to modulate light reflected by said at least two graduations of the body. A light reflection type encoding method and an encoder in accordance with the invention can ensure the error in detecting the variation in the motion of the subject under detection, caused by minor differences in individual graduation width, form or reflectivity, for example, an error in position detection, is very little. One advantage of the present invention is that an optical fiber can be disposed in a single direction opposite to the mobile body for detecting the subject s position with graduations interposed therebetween. Another advantage of the present invention is the simultaneously detection not only of a precise position varying incidentally to the motion of the mobile body, but also any fixed positions with the cycle of said motion. Still further advantges of this invention will become apparent from the following description. In the accompany drawings In the method of the invention, the light is emitted on the mobile body from one end of an optical fiber, through an optical lattice. If it is emitted from the one end of the optical fiber directly on the mobile body, that is, not through the optical lattice, such precise detection as achieved by the present invention can never be expected. According to the invention, the optical lattice must be disposed fixedly relative to said end of the optical fiber, while the mobile body needs to move relatively to the optical fiber. That is, the relative positional relationship between the end of the optical fiber and the optical lattice is fixed, while that between said fiber end and the mobile body connected to the subject under detection is not fixed, ie, relatively mobile. Accordingly, so long as the optical lattice and the mobile body maintain the above described positional relationship with the end of optical fiber, said fiber end and optical lattice are not necessarily static while the mobile body is in motion, but the former two may be in concert motion maintaining the fixed positional relationship while the mobile body remains static or in a different motion from that of the former two. By the use of an optical lattice, it is made possible to emit light on light reflective graduations on the mobile body to detect the motion of the subject under detection, through the inspection of the motion of mobile body, and to control the motion of said subject. Hereinafter the invention will be described mainly as to the above described embodiment, but it should be understood that the one end of the optical fiber and the optical lattice fixedly disposed relative to said fiber end may be connected to the subject under detection and move in response to the motion of said subject, while the mobile body remains static or in different motion from that of the subject. An important feature of the invention is to emit the light transmitted through the optical lattice on at least two light reflective graduations provided in the light emitted zone of the mobile body. That is, according to the present invention employing such an optical lattice, it is made possible to detect the motion of the mobile body even when the light is emitted on several light reflective graduations on the mobile body as above described. On the other hand, by emitting light on a plurality of the light reflective graduations on the mobile body, the difference in the reflected light caused by the very minor differences in form, size and width among the individual graduations is rendered substantially insignificant, allowing the precise detection of the subject s motion irrespective of the possible errors in form, size and width among the individual graduations on the mobile body. Again, the emission of light on several light reflective graduations on the mobile body makes it possible to increase the quantity of light emitted from one end of the optical fiber and to ultimately increase the quantity of the reflected light from the graduations, allowing an extremely precise detection of the motion of the mobile body which moves in response to the motion of the subject under detection. The reception of reflected light from the several light reflective graduations on the mobile body performed by the same end of the optical fiber, through the light transmittable graduations on the optical lattice. That is, the emission of light onto the mobile body and the reception of the reflected light from the mobile body is performed by one and same end of an optical fiber, through an optical lattice which is fixed relatively to said fiber end. Thus the path of the emitted light and that of the reflected light become identical, although reversed in direction, and it becomes possible to effectively utilize the light for detecting the motion of the mobile body, simply by centering the one end of the optical fiber against the light emitted zone of the mobile body connected to the subject under detection. Furthermore, because the optical fiber can be placed in single position opposite to that at which the subject under detection is disposed, in relation to the mobile body which moves in response to the change in the motion of said subject, the mechanical connection of the subject under detection with the mobile body is rendered extremely easy, and miniaturization of the apparatus also can be facilitated. The reflected light from the mobile body received by said fiber end is detected by a photoelectric conversion element connected to the other end of the optical fiber. The reason why the motion of the mobile body connected to the subject under detection can be precisely detected by the method of this invention will be more specifically explained, referring to the attached drawings, Figs. 1a, 1b and 2. Figs. 1a and 1b schematically show the light emitted from one end of an optical fiber onto the light emitted zone of the mobile body through the optical lattice, and reflected by plural reflective graduations on said body, the reflected light again transmitting through the optical lattice and being received by said end of the optical fiber. In Figs. 1a and 1b, the optical lattice 26 has two types of graduations of different light transmittances, ie, light transmittable graduations 28 and substantially non light transmittable, reflective graduations 28 , alternately arranged. Whereas, the mobile body 20 has the two types of graduations having different reflectivities, ie, light reflective graduations 24 and substantially non light reflective graduations 24 which are preferably light transmittable, alternately arranged. Those four types of graduations are advantageously identical in shape, and can be at least superposed with one another. According to Fig. 1a, the luminous flux emitted from the end 30a of an optical fiber 30 against the optical lattice 26 fixedly disposed relative to said end 30a the arrows from 30a pointing right in the drawing is partly reflected by the graduations 28 the arrows from 26 pointing left when it reaches the optical lattice 26, and the rest transmits through the graduations 28 of optical lattice 26, to reach the graduations 24 on the mobile body 20 to be reflected the arrows from 24 pointing left . The reflected light again transmits through the optical lattice 26 to return to to be received by the end 30a of the optical fiber 30. According to Fig. 1b, it will be understood that the luminous flux emitted from the end 30a of optical fiber 30 against the optical lattice 26 is partly reflected by the graduations 28 similarly to the case of Fig. 1a, the rest transmitting through the graduations 28 and also through plural graduations 24 on the mobile body 20 the arrows from 20 pointing right . Therefore, under the state illustrated in Fig. 1b, only a part of the luminous flux originally emitted from the end 30a of optical fiber 30 against the optical lattice 26, ie, only the reflected light by the graduations 28 on optical lattice 26, returns to the fiber end 30a. In the state illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b, if same quantity of light is emitted from the optical fiber end 30a, the quantity of the reflected light received by said end 30a in Fig. 1a and that in Fig. 1b differ clearly. The optical lattice 26 is fixedly disposed relative to the end 30a of optical fiber 30, while the mobile body 20 moves relatively to the same fiber end 30a. Therefore in the actual operation the relation between the graduations on the optical lattice 26 and those on the mobile body 20 continuously changes from the state of Fig. 1a to that of Fig. 1b, or vice versa, accompanying the relative movement of the mobile body 20, and consequently the quantity of reflected light also continuously changes incidentally thereto. Thus according to the present invention, for example, if the repetition of the continuous change between the state of Fig. 1a and that of Fig. 1b is represented graphically, taking the amount of displacement of the mobile body with said optical fiber end on the axis of abscissae and the quantity of reflected light, on the axis of ordinates, a curved line indicating the quantity of reflected light with a constant cycle can be obtained as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, by detecting such a curve of the reflected light with a photoelectric conversion element connected to the other end of the optical fiber, the amount of displacement of the mobile body which moves in response to the change in the motion of the subject under detection, namely the change in the motion of the subject itself, can be precisely detected. According to the method of this invention, the light from one end of the optical fiber is emitted first against the optical lattice fixedly disposed relatively to said fiber end, as aforesaid. The optical lattice has the graduations of different light transmittances and therefore does not transmit light through all of the light emitted zone, but transmits light only through its light transmittable graduations occupying a part of said zone. Said graduations may consist of, for example, those of high light transmittance and those of low light transmittance. The former may be slits which let pass the emitted light substantially as it is, or may be the transparent base of the optical lattice itself. Also the graduations of low light transmittance may substantially absorb and or scatter the emitted light, which may be, for example, the material itself of the optical lattice having substantially no transmittance, or may be formed on the surface of the optical lattice with a substance having substantially no ability to transmit light, for example, paint, when the optical lattice is made of a highly light transmittable material. It is also possible to make the optical lattice surface to scatter or absorb substantially all of the emitted light, for example by making it aventurine. The optical lattice should have at least one, preferably at least two, graduations of high light transmittance. More preferably, it has a number of graduations having high light transmittance for example, 2 100 and a number of graduations having low light transmittance eg. 2 100 , which are alternately arranged in groups. In the optical lattice, preferably the graduations of high light transmittance and those of low light transmittance are regularly arranged, and more preferably the light transmittable graduations and substantially non light transmittable graduations are alternately and regularly arranged. If there are a number of both types of the graduations, they may be substantially identical or different in form, size and width, etc., substantially identical ones being preferred. The light transmitted through the optical lattice is emitted on at least two light reflective graduations on the illuminated zone of the mobile body which moves in response to the motion of the subject under detection, reflected thereby, again transmitted through the optical lattice, and is received by the one end of the optical fiber. The reflective graduations on the mobile body can consist of, for example, graduations of different reflectivities, eg, those of high reflectivity and those of low reflectivity or graduations reflecting the emitted light with mutually different spectra. The graduations having different reflectivities may consist of, if white light is to be emitted, those having a high reflectivity painted with highly bright white or silver paint, and those having a low reflectivity painted with light absorbing black color or gray. The latter graduations may be the light transmittable slits provided on the mobile body. Also, either one type of the graduations may be formed of the base of the mobile body itself. As the graduations reflecting the emitted light with different spectra, for example, those simply reflecting the light having substantially the same spectrum to that of the emitted light, such as the reflective graduations substantially incapable of absorbing light within the wavelength region of the emitted light graduations which absorb the light of specific wavelength or wavelength region within the emitted light and reflect the remainder, eg, those absorbing blue light alone of white light and reflecting the rest or the graduations having wavelength shifting ability such as those reflecting white light as fluorescent light may be suitably used. When such graduations are used, the movement of the mobile body relevant to that of the subject under detection can be detected, by inspecting the spectra of the reflected lights, eg, detecting the intensity of light at specific wavelength or wavelength region. According to the present invention, the graduations of the optical lattice and those of the mobile body have such a relationship that the reflected light received at one end of the optical fiber possesses a certain regularity capable of specifying the motion of the mobile body relative to said fiber end. So long as such a relationship is maintained, the number, form, size, width, etc. of the graduations on the optical lattice as well as those on the mobile body, are optional. For example, the form of the graduations may be linear, a polygon such as a slender quadrilateral, eg, a rectangle, regular tetragon or triangle, or a round shape such as circle or oval. The size of the graduations may be a polygon with the length of shorter side or one side ranging from the order of microns to several millimeters or a round shape with the diameter or shorter diameter ranging from the order of microns to several millimeters. Preferred form of the graduations is linear or rectangular, because such can be densely formed. The relationship between the graduations on the optical lattice and those on the mobile body producing a certain regularity in the reflected light is such that, preferably, the intervals among the light transmittable graduations on the optical lattice, or the lattice pitch, can superpose with the light reflective graduations on the mobile body which moves relatively to the optical lattice, substantially in the same direction, optically and regularly. A typical relationship is that between the graduations on the optical lattice wherein light transmittable linear graduations having a µ shorter sides and non light transmittable reflective linear graduations having a µ shorter sides are alternately disposed with the longer sides serving as the borders, and the graduations on the mobile body wherein reflective, linear or rectangular graduations with a µ shorter sides and light transmittable, linear or rectangular graduations with a µ shorter sides are alternately disposed with the longer sides serving as the borders. In another example, with the optical lattice having the above described graduations, the mobile body has the graduations wherein reflective, rectanglar graduations with 2a µ shorter sides and light transmittable, rectangular graduations with a µ shorter sides are alternately disposed, with their longer sides serving as the borders. The graduations on the optical lattice can consist of a light transmittable, rectangular graduation with a µ shorter sides, a non light transmittable reflective , rectangular graduation with b µ shorter side, a light transmittable, rectangular graduation with c µ shorter side, and a non light transmittable reflective , rectangular graduation with d µ shorter side disposed side by side by the order stated, with their longer sides serving as the borders, while the graduations on the mobile body consist also of the above four types of graduations disposed side by side by the order stated, and appearing cyclically. The light transmitted through the optical lattice is emitted on the mobile body which moves relatively to the optical fiber. Therefore, it is possible according to this invention to make one end of an optical fiber static, and to emit light from the static fiber end on at least two reflective graduations on the mobile body, through an optical lattice fixedly disposed against the static fiber end. The light may be emitted from one end of a moving optical fiber, through an optical lattice fixedly disposed against the fiber end, on at least two reflective graduations on a static mobile body or the body making a different motion from that of the optical fiber. In the latter case, if the fiber end and the mobile body make different movements, included are such embodiments wherein the two move in mutually opposite directions, or move in a same direction with different speeds. The motion may be any that performed with a certain regularity, for example, a rectilinear motion, curvilinear motion or rotatory motion. The reflected light from the plural reflective graduations on the mobile body is received by the aforesaid optical fiber end, through the optical lattice, and detected by the photoelectric conversion element connected to the other end of the optical fiber as aforesaid. A preferred embodiment of this invention comprises emitting light from one end of optical the fiber, through at least two graduations having high light transmittance of the optical lattice fixedly disposed relative to said fiber end, on at least two light reflective graduations on the mobile body, receiving the light, which is reflected by said light reflective graduations and transmitted through at least two graduations on the optical lattice, by said end of the optical fiber, and detecting thus received reflected light with a photoelectric conversion element connected to other end of the optical fiber. By such a method it is made possible to catch the light reflected by the plural graduations on the mobile body always as the standardized light, at one end of the optical fiber, regardless the minor deviations in width, shape, reflection characteristics such as reflectivity, among said graduations. Thus the positional variation of the mobile body, and consequently the variation in the motion of the subject under detection, can be detected with extremely high precision. According to the present invention, a light reflection type encoder comprises The optical fiber can be a single optical fiber composed of a core and clad, eg, step type or focusing type, or a bundle of optical fibers composed of plural strands of single optical fiber comosed of a core and clad which will be hereinafter collectively referred to as an optical fiber . Such optical fibers are known The first member may be mounted on said end of the optical fiber or installed spaced from said fiber end, so long as it is disposed fixedly relative to said fiber end. The first member may assume various forms, eg, a film, a plate, a disc, a cylinder or a rod with circular cross section. The second member again may take various forms, eg, a film, a plate, a disc, a cylinder or a rod with circular cross section. In the encoder of the present invention comprising the first member disposed fixedly relatively to one end of an optical fiber and the second member movable relatively to said fiber end, the first member may be a static, fixed body and the second member, a mobile body which is connected to the subject under detection and moves in response to the motion of said subject, or In the above disclosed encoder of this invention, it is preferred that the first and second members should move with a certain regularity, for example, a rectilinear motion, curvilinear motion or rotatory motion, etc. Therefore, in the encoder of this invention, the first and second members may make a rotatory movement relatively to each other, or a rectilinear or curvilinear motion, also in relative terms. The second member has, on the surface opposing the first member, graduations having differing light reflectivities, and the first member has, at the place confronting said graduations on the second member, graduations having differing light transmittances. Shape, size, width and mutual relations, etc. of these graduations are already described concerning the method of this invention. In the encoder of this invention, one end of the optical fiber is disposed at the position opposite to the graduations of the first member optical lattice . As already stated, said end of the optical fiber must be so disposed that it can emit the light from the light source, through the graduations on the first member, preferably at least two light transmittable graduations, on at least two graduations on the second member, and also can receive the light reflected by at least two reflective graduations on said second member. This will be more specifically explained, referring to Figs. 3a and 3b. Fig. 3a shows, schematically, the fiber end, seen from the axial direction of said fiber, through the optical lattice disposed fixedly relatively to said fiber end. On said end 30a, for example, twenty two strands of optical fibers A and B are present at random. The optical fibers A signify the fibers for emitting light toward the optical lattice, and the optical fibers B, the fibers for receiving the reflected light from the reflective graduations on the second member not shown, which is understood to be located in front of the drawing . Again, the optical lattice has, for example, light transmittable graduations 28 and light reflective graduations 28 . At the state illustrated in Fig. 3a, the light emitted from the optical fibers A transmits through the optical lattice at the graduations 28, but is reflected by the optical lattice at the graduations 28 and received by the optical fibers B. The light transmitted through the graduations 28 of the optical lattice reaches the second member. If the light reflective graduations on the second member are located there, the light reflected to again transmit through the graduations 28 of the optical lattice to be received by the optical fibers B facing said graduations 28. If the light transmittable graduations on the second member are located there, the light transmits therethrough, and does not come back to the optical fiber. If the other ends of the optical fibers A are combined into a bundle and connected to a light source to transmit light, and the other ends of the optical fibers B are combined into a separate bundle and connected to a photoelectric converter to allow detection of the reflected light, the reflected light will show a constant, systematic variation accompanying the motion of the second member cf. Fig. 2 . By detecting the variation, therefore, the motion of the second member which moves in response to the motion of the subject can be detected. Consequently, the motion of said subject itself can be detected. Fig. 3b shows, schematically, the state similar to that illustrated in Fig. 3a, except that the optical fiber is a single fiber. In this case also the light is emitted through the end 30a of the optical fiber, transmitting through the light transmittable graduations 28 of the optical lattice but being reflected at the graduations 28 and received by the same fiber end 30a. The light transmitted through the graduations 28 of the optical lattice is either reflected by the light reflective graduations of the second member not shown or transmits through the light transmittable graduations, similarly to the case of Fig. 3a. In this case also, therefore, the reflected light received at the end 30a of the optical fiber shows the constant, systematic variation accompanying the motion of the second member. Hence, for example, if the other end of the optical fiber is branched, one being connected to the light source and the other, to a photoelectric converter, the movement of the subject under detection can be determined similarly to the case of Fig. 3a. In Figs. 3a and 3b, the optical fiber may be step type or focusing type as aforesaid, and said end of the optical fiber may be substantially flat, or convex, eg, a curved surface such as convex lens, convex ellipsoid or convex sphere. The convex, curved surfaces are like those formed by a liquid at the front end of a capillary tube. Such a surface can be easily formed by fusing said end of the optical fiber. It can be also understood that, if an optical path changing element such as a lens, mirror or prism is placed between said fiber end and the first member disposed statically relatively to said fiber end an optical lattice , still the light emitted from the fiber end transmits through the optical path changing element to reach the graduations of the first member and partly, the graduations of the second member, and the light reflected by the graduations of the second member again transmits through the graduations of the first member and the optical path changing element to be received by said end of the optical fiber. Thus it is also within the scope of this invention to interpose an optical path changing element. Further according to this invention, a light reflector type encoder comprises In the above described encoder, the graduations on the mobile body can move systematically relatively to the graduations provided on the fixed body, in response to the motion of the subject under detection, and the mobile body preferably is a rotator. If the mobile body is a rotator, preferably it has the graduations of differing light reflectivities and of substantially constant width, on the surface facing the fixed body, along the circumference of a hypothetical circle having an identical radius from the center of rotation axis. Again, when the mobile body is a rotator, a rotator having two types of graduations of different light reflectivities which are provided on the surface of the rotatory plate facing the fixed body, along the circumferences of at least two hypothetical circles of different radii from the center of the rotation axis and a fixed body having preferably at least two graduations having different light transmittances and superposing with said graduations on the rotatory plate optically with regularity, provided on at least a part of the place facing the rotatory plate, can be used. With such a rotator and fixed body, it is possible to detect, for example, simultaneously with the positional detection of the rotator by means of the reflected light from the graduations provided along the circumference of the first hypothetical circle on the rotator, the position of the rotator also by means of the reflected light from graduations along the circumference or circumferences of second or more of the hypothetical circles. This allows very precise detection of the rotator s position, and consequently, very precise detection of the motion of the subject under detection which is connected to said rotator. Furthermore, the direction of rotation or absolute position of the rotator can be precisely detected, which enables to know and control the absolute position of the subject under detection, from a place distant from said subject. Hereinafter the subject method and the encoder will be more concretely explained, referring to the attached drawings. The first example of this invention will be explained, referring to Figs. 4, 1a and 1b. Fig. 4 is an explanatory diagram of the light reflector type encoder in accordance with the first example of this invention, in which, 20 is a rotatory plate, which is connected to the subject under detection not shown such as, for example, a motor of various apparatuses, by means of a shaft 22, or the like. On the surface of said plate 20, a large number of light transmittable graduations 24 are provided at an identical pitch, spaced from the center of the rotation axis by a substantially same radius. In the illustrated model, the graduations 24 are the slits, which allow the light to pass through, whereby providing so to speak a reflectivity different from that of the surface of the rotatory plate 20. Obviously it is possible to form the graduations 24 from a material having a different light reflectivity from that of the surface of the rotatory plate 20, as previously explained. In that case, the interspaces among the graduations 24 should be understood to serve as the graduations of different light reflectivity. Further, in the drawing, 26 is a fixed body optical lattice fixedly disposed relatively to the end 30a of an optical fiber 30, which is made of a disc of equal diameter with that of the rotatory disc 20 and installed coaxially and non contactingly adjacent to said rotatory disc 20, and plural light transmittable graduations 28 are provided thereon, along a part of the circumference of a hypothetical circle of equal radius from the center of rotation axis with that supposed in providing the graduations 24 on the rotatory disc 20, at the identical pitch with that of the graduations 24. The number of graduations 28 is determined in relation to the size of the area emitted by the light from the later described optical fiber 30. Incidentally, in the illustrated model the graduations 28 on the fixed plate 26 are slits, but obviously they may be made of a material of higher light transmittance than that of the surface of the fixed plate 26, as already explained. In this case also the inter spaces among the graduations 28 should be understood to serve as the light reflective graduations. The fixed plate 26 not necessarily has the same shape with that of rotatory plate 20, but may have the size and shape corresponding to those of the light emitted area. An optical fiber 30 is disposed with its one end 30a facing with the graduations 28 on the fixed plate 26, and the other end 30b connected to an optical signal processing means 32. As aforesaid, this optical fiber 30 may be a single strand of optical fiber or a bundle of strands of optical fibers. The optical fiber 30 emits the light from the light source within the optical signal processing means 32 onto the graduations 28 on the fixed body 26, and also receives the light reflected from the surface of the fixed plate 26, etc. and transmits it to the optical signal processing means 32. Said end 30a of the optical fiber 30 is worked in advance to emit light on several graduations 28 on the fixed plate 26, in correspondence to the denier size of the optical fiber. The optical signal processing means 32 accommodates the light source and photoelectric conversion element for transducing the light to electric signals which are not shown, such means The light reflection type encoder having the described structure operates as follows. Light is emitted from one end 30a of the optical fiber 30, toward the plural graduations 28 on the fixed plate 26. If the graduations 24 on the rotatory plate 20 and the graduations 28 on the fixed plate 26 are in discrepancy with each other at the moment cf. Fig. 1a , the light emitted from the optical fiber 30 is reflected by almost entire lighted area. When subsequently the rotatory plate 20 rotates by the distance of half a graduation, the graduations 24 and 28 superpose with each other cf. Fig. 1b and a part of the light emitted from the optical fiber 30 transmits through the graduations 28 on the fixed plate 26 and the graduations 24 on the rotary plate 20, and the remnant of the light emitted on the surface of the fixed plate 26 is reflected. And, when the rotatory plate 20 further rotates by the distance of another half a graduation, the graduations 24 and 28 again become discrepant with each other, and the light is reflected by approximately the entirety of the emitted area. Thus, during the rotatory plate s rotation by the distance of one graduation, the light reflectivity varies by one cycle, and this variation is detected by the optical signal processing means 32 through the optical fiber 30, to confirm that the subject under detection rotated by the predetermined angle. In the above described first example, the end 30a of the optical fiber 30 is placed opposite to a statically installed plate 26, and the other member, ie, the rotatory plate 20, is rotated in response to the motion of the subject under detection. An equivalent function can be obtained by fixedly connecting the optical fiber end 30a and the graduations on the fixed plate 26, rotating the fixed plate 26 around its center axis in response to the motion of the subject under detection, and installing a member equivalent to the rotatory plate 20 but in a static mode. In this case, such a structure can be employed wherein the optical signal processing means 32 and the other end 30b of the optical fiber 30 are also statically installed, and the optical fiber end 30a and the fixed plate 26 are rotated. A light reflection type encoder, eg, a position detector, according to the second example of this invention will be explained, referring to Fig. 5. The device comprises a statically disposed optical fiber 40, a static, graduated plate 44 which is fixed on one end 42 of the optical fiber 40 and serves as the first member, a shifting, graduated plate 46 which shifts in longitudinal direction in correspondence to the motion of the subject under detection, and an optical signal processing means 50 which is connected to the other end 48 of the optical fiber 40. The shifting, graduated plate 46 is formed of a long rectangular plate, and provided with the graduations formed at a uniform pitch and composed of two materials of different light reflectivities, as illustrated. Said plate 46 shifts in the direction indicated by the arrow, ie, the longitudinal direction, in correspondence to the motion of the subject under detection. The static, graduated plate 44 is fixed on the one end 42 of the optical fiber 40, at a position facing the graduations 52 of the shifting, graduated plate 46. Thus, the optical fiber 40, the static, graduated plate 44 and the optical signal processing means 50 are statically installed at fixed positions. This device according to the second example operates similarly to the aforesaid device according to the first example. That is, the shifting, graduated plate 46 moves in the longitudinal direction, in response to the motion of the subject under inspection. Accompanying this shift, the reflectivity of the light emitted from the end 42 of the optical fiber 40 onto the shifting, graduated plate 46, through the static, graduated plate 44, varies. By receiving the reflected light at said end 42 of the optical fiber 40 and processing the optical signal with the optical signal processing means 50, the position of the subject can be detected. In the above device according to the second example, the shifting, graduated plate 46 moves in response to the motion of the subject under detection, but the structure may be so modified that said plate 46 is statically installed at a fixed position, and the optical fiber end 42 and the static, graduated plate 44 fixed thereon are moved in response to the motion of the subject under inspection. A light reflection type encoder in accordance with the third example of this invention will be explained, referring to Fig. 6. This device comprises an optical fiber 60, a graduated member 64 fixedly installed relatively to one end 62 of said optical fiber 60, a rotatory, graduated member 68 which is connected to the subject under inspection through a shaft 66 or the like, and an optical signal processing means 72 connected to the other end 70 of the optical fiber 60. The rotatory, graduated member 68 is columnar, and has the graduations 69 provided at an equal pitch and formed of the materials of different reflectivities, on its outer peripheral surface. As aforesaid, this member 68 is connected to the subject under inspection through the shaft 66 or the like, and rotates in response to the motion of said subject. The end 62 of the optical fiber 60 is fixed on a supporting plate 74, and the graduated member 64 also is fixed on the supporting plate 74. Thus the graduated member 64 is fixedly installed relatively to the end 62 of the optical fiber 60. The graduated member 64 is composed of a supporting frame 76 and a film 78 which is supported by said frame 76. The film 78 is provided with vertical stripes which are alternately transparent and nontransparent, serving as the graduations of differing light transmittances. These graduations on the film 78 have the identical pitch with that of the graduations 69 on the rotatory, graduated member 68. The other end 70 of the optical fiber 60 is connected to the optical signal processing means 72, similarly to the previous example. This device according to the third example again operates similarly to the devices according to the first and second examples, and can detect the position of the subject, by the rotation of the rotatory, graduated member 68 in response to the motion of the subject under detection. A light reflection type encoder according to the fourth specific example of this invention will be explained, referring to Fig. 7. This device comprises an optical fiber 80, the first graduated member 84 installed fixedly relatively to the end 82 of said optical fiber 80, the second graduated member 88 which is connected to the subject under detection, through a pinion 86, an optical signal processing means 90 which can have the similar structure to that of those employed in the foregoing examples, and a disc formed supporting base 92 for supporting the optical fiber 80, etc. The second graduated member 88 is cylindrical, and is rotatably supported on the disc formed supporting base 92 so that it can rotate around the center axis of said base 92. Graduations 94 made of the materials of different reflectivities are formed on the upper part of the internal side of the second member 88, and the lower part of the outer peripheral surface of said member is a gear 96 which engages with the pinion 86 for conducting the motion of the subject under detection. Thus the second graduated member 88 is rotated in response to the motion of said subject. On the disc formed supporting base 92, the optical fiber 80, the first graduated member 84 and the optical signal processing means 90 are fixedly installed. Thus the first member 84 is positioned fixedly relatively to the end 82 of the optical fiber 80 and also faces the graduations 94 on the second member 88. The disc formed supporting base 92 can rotate around its center axis, and its lower part of the outer peripheral surface is formed into a gear 100. The gear 100, for example, engages with a pinion 98 which rotates in the reversed direction from that of the pinion 86 but at an equal angular velocity, in response to the motion of the subject under detection. In this device according to the fourth specific example, the first member 84 and the second member 88 rotate in reverse directions at an equal angular velocity, in response to the motion of the subject under detection. Thus it is made possible to detect the position of the subject, with the precision twice higher than that of the case wherein either one of the members is fixed. It is also feasible to rotate the first member 84 in response to the motion of the subject under detection, while the second member 88 is rotated in the same or opposite direction at a constant speed or any optional speed. Thus it becomes possible to detect the position of the subject relative to a predetermined standard point under motion, which is determined depending on the rotation speed of the second member 88. Fig. 2 shows the variation in the quantity of reflected light in relation to, for example, the rotation of the rotatory plate 20, as aforesaid. In the graph, the curve A denotes, for example, the state of variation in the Example shown in Fig. 4, wherein the optical fiber 30 is installed on the side of the fixed plate 26. In this case, even if the flatness on the surface of fixed plate 26 is nonuniform, the quantity of reflected light from said surface shows always a constant value, stabilizing the minimum value. Consequently the absolute amplitude of the variation ratio becomes large, allowing sure detection of the variation in the quantity of the reflected light, and hence, of the positional variation of the subject under inspection. The curve B in Fig. 2 shows the state of variation in the quantity of reflected light, when the optical fiber 30 is installed on the side of the rotatory plate 20. That is, when the optical fiber 30 is installed on the side of the rotatory plate 20 and emission and reflection of light are effected, because the flatness of the surface of the plate 20 is imperfect and the space between the end of the optical fiber and the rotator varies accompanying the rotation, the position and angle of the graduations on the plate 20 change. Consequently the quantity of reflected light varies with the rotation of plate 20, and the maximum and minimum quantities of reflected light become unstable, reducing the absolute amplitude of the quantitative variation of the reflected light, and the sure positional detection of the subject cannot be effected. Again the curve C in Fig. 2 shows the quantitative variation of reflected light, when a light having an emission area corresponding to the width of plural graduations is emitted in the conventional light reflection type positional detector, in which, instead of using a graduated plate fixedly installed relative to one end of an optical fiber, a single sheet of graduated plate is shifted against said end of the optical fiber to effect the positional detection. In that case, not only the minimum and maximum values vary depending on the degree of flatness of the surface of the graduated plate 11, but the amplitude of variation in the quantity of reflected light is small, rendering a precise positional detection nearly impossible. Furthermore, in the present invention the number of graduations on the first member optical lattice has no substantial influence on the quantitative variation ratio in the reflected light. Therefore, it is entirely optional to enlarge the emission area for obtaining a large quantity of light, to reduce the individual graduation width on the first member for more finely dividing the graduations on the second member, or to reduce the pitch of the graduations. As so far described, according to the present invention the amplitude of variation in the reflected light can be enlarged by receiving the reflected light from at least two light reflective graduations on the mobile body, at one end of the optical fiber, and furthermore the minimum and maximum values can be always maintained at substantially constant level. Therefore the variation in the motion of the subject under inspection can be detected with large, stable signals, and hence the variation in the subject s motion can be precisely detected. According to the present invention, any motions of any subjects can be detected, as long as the subject can move or be shifted relatively to one end of an optical fiber. Variation in any motions, for example, those in the subject s position, pressure, velocity, volume and the like, can be detected, by converting the motion to that of the second member mobile body . Such motions of a subject under inspection can be converted to those of the mobile body, by conducting the variation in the motion of the subject to the mobile body, by any optional physical, mechanical or physicochemical means.
