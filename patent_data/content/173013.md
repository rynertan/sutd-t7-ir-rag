# Rotary compressor.

## Abstract
Discharge gas which has been compressed within a compressor main body 3 is cooled by heat dissipation through a heat exchanger 23 , after which it is again return ed to the compressor. When the lubricant oil is sucked by means of the pressure of the discharge gas, it is also cooled. Each and every component part of the compressor and an associated electric motor 2 is cooled by causing the cooled discharge gas to pass therethrough, whereby the tem perature rise in the compressor as a whole can be sup pressed.
