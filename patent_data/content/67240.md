# Process for separating trioxane.

## Abstract
In a process for separating trioxane by a continuous distillation which comprises extracting, with benzene, the trioxane containing distillate obtainable by heating an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, feeding the trioxane containing benzene solution into a distillation column as a starting material, distilling out the benzene from the column top and withdrawing the trioxane from the column bottom, a process for separating trioxane which comprises retaining the concentration of trioxane X in the liquid composition at the starting material feeding plate of the distillation column by weight of trioxane based on the total liquid composi tion at the feeding plate in the range satisfying the following relationship
