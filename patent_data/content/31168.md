# PROCESS FOR COPOLYMERIZING ETHYLENE WITH N BUTENE 1

## Abstract
A process for copolymerizing ethylene with n butene 1 with a catalyst comprising A a transition metal compound component supported on a solid carrier and B an organometallic compound component of a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table is described which comprises selectively hydrogenating a mixed C₄ fraction containing 10 by weight or more of n butene 1 which remains after the extraction of 1,3 butadiene from a C₄ fraction of cracked hydrocarbons so that the resulting hydrogenated fraction contains 200 ppm by volume or less of 1,3 butadiene and n butene 1 in an amount of at least 80 based on the amount of n butene 1 contained in the mixed C₄ fraction, using this hydrogenated fraction as the source of n butene 1 in the copolymerization, and using as said organometallic compound component a non acidic or low acidic organometallic compound.
