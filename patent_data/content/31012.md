# Steel strip continuous annealing apparatus.

## Abstract
A steel strip continuous annealing apparatus comprising a steel strip feeder a heating soaking zone 20,30 for heating and soaking the steel strip at a predetermined temperature a first cooling zone 40 for rapidly cooling the steel strip at a predetermined cooling rate a second cooling zone 60 for slowly cooling the steel strip or holding same at a predeter mined temperature a third cooling zone 70 for cooling the steel strip to substantially the room temperature and a steel strip carry out device wherein the first cooling zone 40 incorporates therein forcible cooling means, the second cool ing zone 60 incorporates therein hot cold change over means and said forcible cooling means incorporated in the first cooling zone 40 is provided thereon with self cooling means so that steel strips of various grades of steel different in required heat cycle to be applied thereto can be efficiently and stably annealed.
