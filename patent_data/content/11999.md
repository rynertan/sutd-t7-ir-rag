# Bottle closure.

## Abstract
A variety of problems have been encountered in provid ing vessel closures with packings which can easily be peeled off, mainly due to the necessity of bonding the packing to the vessel closure shell sufficiently strongly to ensure that the packing does not fall off, for example when being transported, yet still allowing the packing to be peeled away manually without needing to exert undue force. These difficulties can now be overcome using a vessel closure in which the peel strength of that region 3a of the peelable interface between two coating layers 3,4 bonding packing 9 to a vessel clos ure shell 1 which corresponds to the peeling initiating por tion of the packing or is adjacent thereto is lower than the peel strength of other regions 3b of the peelable interface.
