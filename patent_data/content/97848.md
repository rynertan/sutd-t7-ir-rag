# Method for manufacturing semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device is manufactured by selectively removing an insulating film 28 which covers at least one conductive layer 24, 26, 27 to form at least one contact hole 29 partially exposing the conductive layer 24, 26, 27 . Then, a layer of an inorganic conductive material having a melting point lower than the material comprising the conductive layer 24, 26, 27 is formed on a surface of the insulating film 28 and is melted to fill the contact hole 29 with the inorganic conductive material. Finally a wiring layer 32 is formed in contact with the inorganic conductive material filled in the contact hole 29 .
