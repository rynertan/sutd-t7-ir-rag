# Device for forming solder connections.

## Abstract
This invention relates to heat shrinkable devices for forming solder connections between electrical conductors. The devices each comprise of a hollow, heat shrinkable sleeve having first and second ends, and contain a quantity of solder. Both ends contain heat softenable sealing ma terial which seal the ends upon recovery of the article, the sealing material at the second end being less responsive to heat than the sealing material at the first end. The conductors to be connected are inserted into the first end of the sleeve and the sleeve recovered. Because the sealing material at the second end does not seal the second end until after the sealing material at the first end has recovered about the inserted conductors at the first end, any hot gases evolved within the article can exit the article via the second end. The invention enables a reliable connection to be made between electrical conductors that are provided with heat sensitive insulation.
