# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING NONWOVEN FABRICS SUITED FOR USE AS WIPERS

## Abstract
Nonwoven fabrics showing rubber like elasticity in a wet condition, having good wear resistance and strength and retaining flexibility even in a dry condition are obtained by causing a nonwoven fabric containing, as essential consti tuent fibers, 60 90 weight percent of highly shrinkable polyvinyl alcohol fibers capable of absorbing water to shrink of which a maximum shrinking temperature in water is within the range of 65 90 C with a maximum shrinkage percentage of not less than 50 percent and 10 40 weight percent of binder fibers having a melting point not higher than 200 C to shrink by warm water treatment to an extent such that the areal reduction amounts to 35 65 percent and further melting the surface of the binder fibers by heating.
