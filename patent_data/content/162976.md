# Process for preparation of porous carbon plates.

## Abstract
Porous carbon plates are made by forming a sheet from a stuff mixture comprising 65 90 weight parts of a carbon fiber forming organic fiber and 10 35 weight parts of a pulp according to a paper making method impregnating the sheet with a solution of an organic polymeric substance to prepare an impregnated sheet subjecting the impregnated sheet to an oxidizing treatment and then carbonizing the infusibilized sheet at a temperature of at least 800 C in an inert gas atmosphere.
