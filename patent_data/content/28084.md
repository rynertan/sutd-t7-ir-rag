# Apparatus and method for inserting a fabric web into the ballast of a rail road track.

## Abstract
A fabric insertion system for placing fabric 10 in the rock ballast roadbed 12 of an existing railroad track at a predeter mined depth beneath the ties 14 of the track includes a car 16 for supporting a roll 18 of fabric which is to be inserted into the ballast. A fabrik insertion sled 20 is secured to the car in a position beneath the car and in the ballast at a prede termined depth beneath the ties. The sled receives fabric 10 from the roll 18 on the car and the fabric is diverted within the sled such that it emerges therefrom at the depth of the sled. Fabric is continuously inserted into the ballast as the car and sled are moved along the track.
