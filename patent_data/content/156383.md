# ELECTRODE ALIGNMENT AND CAPSULE DESIGN FOR SINGLE ENDED LOW WATTAGE METAL HALIDE LAMPS

## Abstract
A low wattage single ended metal halide arc discharge lamp has an isothermal arc chamber with an outer diameter t substantially equal to the product of a first constant and the lamp wattage plus a second constant a fill gas and a pair of electrical conductors sealed into and passing through one end of the arc chamber to provide a pair of electrodes therein having a spacing therebetween of a distance to provide a substantially uniform current for lamps in the range of about 35 to 150 watts.
