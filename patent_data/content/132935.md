# EDM using hydrocarbon and water liquids.

## Abstract
An improved EDM system includes a partition member which separates a space surrounding a workpiece 6 in a worktank 3 into a first chamber which directly surrounds a machining area of the workpiece and a second chamber out side of the first chamber and surrounding a portion of the workpiece. The machining area and the first chamber are contiguous with each other and flooded with a machining medium Lh constituted by a liquid hydrocarbon to allow successive electrical discharges to be effected therethrough to electroerosively remove material from the workpiece in the first chamber. The second chamber is flooded with a coolant Lw constituted by a water liquid, preferably containing a non ionic surface active agent dissolved in deionized water, in contact with the said portion of the workpiece to cool the latter against heating thereof along the machining area by the ero sive discharges in the first chamber.
