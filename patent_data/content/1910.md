# Preparation of 4,4 dihydroxy stilbenes or derivatives thereof.

## Abstract
Dehydrohalogenation rearrangement of 1,1 bis 4 oxysubstituted aryl 2 haloethanes to yield 4,4 dioxy substituted stilbenes is effected by heating an acidic reaction medium comprising the 1,1 bis 4 oxy substituted aryl 2 haloethane dissolved in a solution of an aliphatic carboxylic acid and a carboxylic acid salt. The process is particularly directed to the preparation of 4,4 dihydroxystilbene from 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 chloroethane. The 4,4 dihydroxystilbene may further be acylated to the diacyloxy derivative.
