# Improved vapor phase catalytic oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride.

## Abstract
Oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride using a vanadium phosphorus oxide catalyst, in oxidized form, in a recirculating solids reactor and or using less than the stoichiometric amount of oxygen, based on the total amount of butane converted, and separately regenerating the resultant reduced catalyst.
