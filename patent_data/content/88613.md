# Postal forms.

## Abstract
A form suitable for electricity, gas, water or telephone bills, bank statements etc., which can be folded and stuck down for postal despatch, comprises at least two rectangular elongate regions 1, 3 which can be folded one on to the other, and sticking strips 11, 12 for stabilising the folded state. The rear surface of the form, i.e. that opposite the compiled or printed surface, is free from pre glued sticking strips in that part of the form on which its front face is to be printed 9A, 9B, 9C, 9E , and can thus slide on a backing plate. In these regions sticking is carried out by distributing liquid glue when required, or by previously applying a dry thermosetting glue, and then distributing a moistening agent when these regions are to be stuck.
