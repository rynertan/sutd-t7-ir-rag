# Apparatus for automatically threading separable slide fastener stringers through sliders.

## Abstract
A pair of separable slide fastener stringers 19, 20 is fed along in one plane along parallel spaced paths, respectively, toward throats 81,81 of a Y shaped guide channel 86 in a slider 62 fixed in position. Pins 82, 83 of the stringers 19, 20 are inserted into the guide channel 86 through the throats 81, 81 , respectively. The pins 82, 83 as they emerge from a rear end 87 of the slider 62 are stopped when rows of coupling elements 22, 22 start intermeshing with each other within the guide channel 86 . The separable slide fastener stringers 19, 20 are moved again at the same speed to bring the rows of coupling elements 22, 22 into intermeshing engagement.
