# HYDROCARBON COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING POLYOLEFIN GRAFT POLYMERS

## Abstract
Polymers having useful properties as oil additives are obtained by incorporating additional functional monomer units into oil soluble backbone polymers having linear carbon chains, especially ethylene propylene copolymers and ethylene propylene diene terpolymers. The first functional monomers have at least one nit rogen, sulphur and or oxygen atom in a heterocyclic ring, preferably phenothiazine or the reaction product of phe nothiazine and allyl glycidyl ether. Optionally a second amine polymer preferably N vinylpyrrolidone can be grafted on to the backbone polymer. The polymers of the invention constitute dispersant, anti oxidant, viscosity index improvers for lubricating oils, while the polymers containing both types of monomer unit are also useful as dispersant additives for fuel oils.
