# LOGIC CIRCUIT WITH LOW POWER STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A CMOS logic circuit fabricated on a reduced area of a semiconductor substrate and operating with low power consumption. A load circuit supplies a first potential to an output terminal a logic section selectively supplies a second potential to the output terminal and a data hold circuit or latch holds data at the output terminal when the load circuit is cut off during standby.
