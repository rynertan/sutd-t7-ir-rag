# Cartridge.

## Abstract
A cartridge 6 includes a shutter 17 movably mounted along and on outside surfaces of a cartridge box 6 for open ing or closing a central hole 3 and a head slit 9a together, a slider 20 for driving the shutter 17 , and guide grooves 23a provided outside a receptacle for a disk and serving to guide the slider 20 . The shutter 17 normally closes the central hole 3 and the head slit 9a to permit the cartridge 6 to completely surround the disk 1 , thereby preventing entry of dust from the outside. Even when the slider 20 is broken by accident, the disk 1 is immune from scratches to be constantly held in a good state since the slider 20 is moved on the outside of the receptacle. Moreover, a drive for the shutter 17 is provided forwardly of the center of the receptacle to enable increasing the recording capacity of the disk 1 and miniaturizing the cartridge 6 .
