## Description
ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR FORFLEXIBLE PRINTED CIRCUITS This invention relates generally to terminals and electrical connectors for flexible printed circuits and, more particularly1 to a terminal and an electrical connector of the wipe in type, such as is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,365,694 granted to George W. Parker on January 23, 1968. The connector disclosed in the Parer patent comprises a plug body 26 having two rows of parallel pockets 25 and a plurality of terminals 21 attached to the ends of insulated conductor wires 22A. The terminals 21 are disposed in the pockets 25 and have bowed contact portions 20 which project laterally outwardly of the plug body 26. The bowed contact portions 20 have a wipe in engagement with conductive portions of a flexible printed circuit when the plug body 26 is plugged into a panel 10 or 30 supporting the flexible printed circuit. The object of this invention is to generally improve upon the terminal and electrical connector disclosed in the Parker patent. One feature of the invention is that the terminals are seated against solid portions of the plug body to prevent pushout when the terminals engage the flexible printed circuit. Another feature of the invention is that the terminals are very narrow which reduces the overall width of the electrical connector and permits a closer spacing of the printed circuit conductors, Other objects and features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as the disclosure is made in the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying sheets of drawings in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section of terminals and an electrical connector in accordance with this invention mated with a flexible printed circuit. Figure 2 is a section taken substantially along the line 2 2 of Figure 1 looking in the direction of the arrows. Figure 3 is a section taken substantially along the line 3 3 of Figure 1 looking in the direction of the arrows. Figure 4 is a view of the connector taken substantially along the line 4 4 of Figure 1 looking in the direction of the arrows. Figure 5 is a perspective view showing the electrical connector in the process of being assembled to a panel. Figure 6 is a perspective view showing the electrical connector assembled to a support panel and in position for connection with a flexible printed circuit mounted on its own support panel. Figure 7 is a perspective view of one of the terminals used in the electrical connector shown in Figures 1 6. Referring now to the drawings and particularly to Figure 1, the electrical connector 1O comprises a plug connector body 12 of dielectric material and a plurality of terminals 14 which are attached to the stripped ends of insulated cables 16. The connector body 12 comprises a horizontal or base wall 18 and a plurality of upstanding partition walls 20 which extend from both sides of the base wall 18 to define two rows of open channels 22. The channels 22 have front openings 24 and rear openings 26 at the opposite longitudinal ends of the connector body 10 and longitudinal openings 27 opposite the base wall 18. The longitudinal openings 27 extend the entire length of the connector body 12 and communicate with the respective front and rear openings 24 and 26. The partition walls 20 have tapered plugin portions 28 at the front end of the connector body 12 and intermediate wings 30 which serve as stops. Two inner partition walls 20a are joined together to provide a pair of sockets 32. The sockets 32 are closet to one side of the connector body 12 and serve as indexing means to assure proper panel mounting and connection with the flexible printed circuit as will hereinafter more fully appear. The four outer partition walls 20b have a gusset 34 attached to their respective plug in portions 28 and one of the wings 30. The outer partition walls 20b also have latch arms 36a and 36b attached to their rearward portions. The latch arms 36a and 36b are different sizes and also serve as indexing means to assure proper panel mounting. Each channel 22 has a longitudinal rib 38 projecting into it from a partition wall 20, 20a or 20b at one side of the channel. Each rib 38 is parallel to, and shaped a short distance from, the base wall 18 to define a narrow slot 40 in each channel 22 as shown in Figure 1. Each longi tu inal rib 38 is also spaced from the partition wall 20, 20a or 20b on the opposite side of the channel 22 and has a shoulder 42 which faces the rear opening 26 of the channel as shown in Figure 4. Each terminal 14 is a unitary sheet metal stamping which is bent to shape and has a flat side wall 44 which has a lateral flange 46 integrally attached at a longitudinal edge of its flat side wall. Each terminal 14 further includes a contact bow 48 which is attached to the front edge of the lateral flange 46 and is bent back over the lateral flange 46 so that the bow 42 has a median portion which projects outwardly of its side wall 44.The side wall 44 has a bent front tab 50 which extends in front of the contact bow 48 to protect and reinforce the nose 52 of the contact bow. The contact bow 48 also has a tail 54 which lies between a small lateral flange 56 integrally attached to a longitudinal edge of the side wall 44 opposite the lateral flange 46 and a side tab 58 struck and bent from the side wall 44. The tail 54 is trapped laterally between the side wall 44 and a depending finger 60 which extends from the small lateral flange 56 past the side tab 58. The side wall 44 also has a longitudinal latch tang 62 struck and bent therefrom. The terminal 14 is attached to the cable 16 by a standard double crimp barrel attachment 64 which is integrally connected to a rear edge of the side wall 44 and offset towards the small lateral flange 56 so that it does not interfere with assembly on the terminal 14 into the channel 22. The terminal 14 is inserted into the channel 22 attachment or tail end first through the front opening 24 and seated against the front end of the longitudinal rib 38 with its side wall 44 disposed between the longitudinal rib 38 and one of the partition walls 20, 20a or 20b as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The terminal 14 is retained in the open channel 22 by its lateral flange 46 which is disposed in the slot 40 and its latch tang 62 which engages the shoulder 42 of the longitudinal rib 38 as shown in Figures 1 and 4. The electrical connector 10 is mounted on a support panel 66 from the backside 66a by threading the connector 10 sideways through an appropriately shaped hole 67 in the support panel 66 as shown in Figure 5. After the connector 10 is threaded completely through the hole 67, the connector 10 is aligned with the hole 67 and pushed back into the hole 67 from the front side into the panel mounted position shown in Figure 6. The connector body 12 is secured on the support panel 66 by the wings 30 which engage the front side 66b of the support panel 66 and the latch arms 36 which engage the backside 66a. In some instances, the connector 10 can be mounted from the front side 66b of the support panel 66, by threading the wiring harness 68 through the hole first. However, it is usually easier to mount the connector 10 from the backside 66a because the wiring harness 68 is often very long and complex. The hole 67 has different sized side slots 67a and 67b and offset slots 67c in the other two sides. These slots cooperate with the different sized latch arms 36a and 36b and offset sockets 32, which as noted above serve as indexing means to ensure that the connector 10 is properly mounted on the support panel 66. Figure 6 also shows a representative flexible printed circuit 70 comprising a flexible Molar sheet 72 having a plurality of thin conductive strips 74 attached to one surface. The flexible printed circuit 70 is cut to provide two flap portions 70c and 70b and two index holes 70c. The flexible printed circuit 70 is mounted on a socket member 76 which is shaped to plug onto the connector 10 supported on the panel 66. The socket member 76 has two projecting pins 78 which project through the index holes 70c in the molar sheet 72 to index the flexible printed circuit 70 on the socket member 76. These pins 78 plug into the sockets 32 of the connector body 12 when the socket member 76 is plugged onto the connector 10 to ensure that the connector 1Q and the flexible printed circuit are properly mated.
