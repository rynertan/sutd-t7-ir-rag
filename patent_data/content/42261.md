# ELECTRICALLY ACTIVATABLE RECORDING MATERIAL AND A METHOD OF RECORDING AN IMAGE USING THE MATERIAL

## Abstract
An electrically activatable recording material and a meth od of recording an image using the material. The material com prises an electrically conductive support having thereon, in se quence a a polymeric electrically active conductive EAC layer, b an electrically activatable recording layer comprising A a dye forming coupler, and B an oxidation reduction combination comprising i an organic silver salt oxidizing agent, such as a silver salt of a 1,2,4 mercaptotriazole deriva tive, with ii a reducing agent which, in its oxidized form, forms a dye with the dye forming coupler, and, preferably, c a pho toconductive layer separated from b by an air gap of up to 20 microns, and d an electrically conductive layer wherein the polymeric EAC layer a comprises a halogen containing poly ester,such as poly 2,2 oxydiethylene 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propy lene 50 50 2,5 dibromoterephthalate and poly ethylene 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propylene 50 50 2,5 dibromoterephthalate . The recording material is room light handleable and provides a dye image and silver image by dry development processing.
