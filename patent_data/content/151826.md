compounds of formula I are demonstrated in the following test procedure. Compound 48 80, a mixture of oligomers obtained by condensation of 4 methoxy Compound 48 80 a mixture of oligomers obtained by condensation of 4 methoxy Male rats of a Wistar inbred strain, weighing 220 250 g, were starved overnight, water being available ad libitum. The test compounds were administered orally as a solution or as a suspension in aqueous medium. A control rat and a blank rat received the test compound. One hour later 5 4 diphenylmethyl 1 piperazinylmethyl 1 methyl 1 The second column of tables 1 4 show for a number of compounds of formula I the doses in mg kg body weight at which the distension of the stomach as well as the lesions in the glandular area of the stomach are completely absent in 50 of the test rats ED₅₀ value . In view of their antihistaminic and serotonin antagonistic properties, the compounds of formula I and their acid addition salts are very useful in the treatment of allergic diseases such as, for example, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivities, chronic urticaria, allergic astma and the like. In view of their useful antihistaminic and serotonin antagonistic acitivity, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deletorious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot on, as an ointment. Acid addition salts of I due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets including scored or coated tablets , capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. Active ingredient A.I. as used throughout these examples relates to a compound of formula I , a possible stereochemically isomeric form or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. 500 Grams of the A.I. was dissolved in 0.5 liters of 2 hydroxypropanoic acid and 1.5 liters of the polyethylene glycol at 60 80 C. After cooling to 30 40 C there were added 35 liters of polyethylene glycol and the mixture was stirred well. Then there was added a solution of 1750 grams of sodium saccharin in 2.5 liters of purified water and while stirring there were added 2.5 liters of cocoa flavor and polyethylene glycol q.s. to a volume of 50 liters, providing an oral drop solution comprising 10 milligrams of the A.I, per milliliter. The resulting solution was filled into suitable containers, 9 Grams of methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and 1 gram of propyl 4 hydroxybenzoate were dissolved in 4 liters of boiling purified water. In 3 liters of this solution were dissolved first 10 grams of 2,3 dihydroxybutanedioic acid and thereafter 20 grams of the A.I. The latter solution was combined with the remaining part of the former solution and 12 liters 1,2,3 propanetriol and 3 liters of sorbitol 70 solution were added thereto. 40 Grams of sodium saccharin were dissolved in 0.5 liters of water and 2 milliliters of raspberry and 2 milliliters of gooseberry essence were added. The latter solution was combined with the former, water was added q.s. to a volume of 20 liters providing an oral solution comprising 20 milligrams of the active ingredient per teaspoonful 5 milliliters , The resulting solution was filled in suitable containers. 20 Grams of the A.I., 6 grams sodium lauryl sulfate, 56 grams starch, 56 grams lactose, 0.8 grams colloidal silicon dioxide, and 1.2 grams magnesium stearate were vigorously stirred together. The resulting mixture was subsequently filled into 1000 suitable hardened gelating capsules, comprising each 20 milligrams of the active ingredient. A mixture of 100 grams of the A.I., 570 grams lactose and 200 grams starch was mixed well and thereafter humidified with a solution of 5 grams sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 grams polyvinylpyrrolidone in about 200 milliliters of water. The wet powder mixture was sieved, dried and sieved again. Then there was added 100 grams microcrystalline cellulose and 15 grams hydrogenated vegetable oil. The whole was mixed well and compressed into tablets, giving 10.000 tablets, each containing 10 milligrams of the active ingredient. To a solution of 10 grams methyl cellulose in 75 milliliters of denaturated ethanol there was added a solution of 5 grams of ethyl cellulose in 150 milliliters of dichloromethane. Then there were added 75 milliliters of dichloromethane and 2.5 milliliters 1,2,3 propanetriol. 10 Grams of polyethylene glycol was molten and dissolved in 75 milliliters of dichloromethane. The latter solution was added to the former and then there were added 2.5 grams of magnesium octadecanoate, 5 grams of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 30 milliliters of concentrated colour suspension Opaspray K 1 2109 and the whole was homogenated. The tablet cores were coated with the thus obtained mixture in a coating apparatus. 1.8 Grams methyl 4 hydroxybenzoate and 0.2 grams propyl 4 hydroxybenzoate were dissolved in about 0.5 liters of boiling water for injection. After cooling to about 50 C there were added while stirring 4 grams lactic acid, 0.05 propylene glycol and 4 grams of the A.I.. The solution was cooled to room temperature and supplemented with water for injection q.s. ad 1 liter volume, giving a solution of 4 milligrams A.I. per milliliters. The solution was sterilized by filtration U.S.P. XVII p. 811 and filled in sterile containers. 3 Grams A.I. was dissolved in a solution of 3 grams 2,3 dihydroxybutanedioic acid in 25 milliliters polyethylene glycol 400. 12 Grams surfactant and triglycerides q.s. ad 300 grams were molten together. The latter mixture was mixed well with the former solution. The thus obtained mixture was poured onto moulds at a temperature of 37 38 C to form 100 suppositories each containing 30 milligrams of the active ingredient.
