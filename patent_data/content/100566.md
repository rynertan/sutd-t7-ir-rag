## Description
NOVEL 19 THIO ANDROSTANE DERIVATIVES The invention relates to novel 19 thio androstane derivatives, in particular to novel l9 thio E androsten 3 one derivatives, which moreover are substituted in the 17 position. The invention also relates to the use of these new compounds as inhibitors of the biosynthesis of oestrogens aromatase inhibitors and to pharmaceutical preparations which contain these androstane derivatives as the active constituent. The conversion of androgens to oestrogens is a physiological important reaction in the body, especially in that of women. This conversion takes place via a series of reactions, which are collectively referred to by the term aromatisation. In this aromatisation, a steroidal 3 oxo 4 10 methyl system is converted to an aromatic phenolic ring A.In this, enzymes play an important role. The group of enzymes responsible for aromatisation, or one enzyme from this group, is referred to by the name aromatase. In a normally functioning, healthy body there is an optimum balance between androgens and oestrogens and aromatisation takes place as required in order to maintain this balance as far as possible.Under normal circumstances aromatisation takes place in the body in various tissues in the ovaries of the woman, in peripheral tissues, such as adipose tissue and muscular tissue, and albeit to a lesser degree in the adrenal cortex, the hypothalamus and the brain. There are clinical indications which are due to an excessive production of oestrogens hyperoestrogenicity . Thus, for example, women in the peri menopause have a greater risk of neoplasms breast cancer or uterine cancer , due to a chronic effect of an excess of oestrogens which occurs in the peri menopause. During the reproductive years, obesity in women is often accompanied by anovulation, which is probably a consequence of excessive aromatisation in adipose tissue, and hence excessive oestrogen production. In men also an excessive oestrogen production or a too high estrogen androgen ratio in peripheral or other tissue can give rise to complaints gynaecomastia in adolescents, prostatic hypertrophy . For therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of hyperoestrogenicity, aromatase inhibitors have been proposed, thus substances which inhibit the action of aromatase. Compared to the antioestrogenically active substances which have also been proposed for this purpose, aromatase inhibitors have the advantage that the production of oestrogens can be regulated with them, without completely blocking the effect thereof on target organs. Thus, aromatase inhibitors can also advantageously be used for the prophylaxis and or therapeutic treatment of prostatic hyperplasia caused by a shifting of the oestrogen androgen ratio to higher values. Known substances which have an aromataseinhibiting action are, for example, testolactone U.S. Patent 2,744,120 , 4 hydroxy A4 androstene3,17 dione and esters thereof see, for example,U.S. Patent 4,235,893 , 10 1,2 propadienyl A4 oestrene 3,17 dione U.S. Patent 4,289,762 and l0 2 propynyl A4 oestrene 3 , 17 dione J.A.C. S. 1981, 103, 3221 and U.S. Patent 4,322,416 . A new group of androstane derivatives having aromatase inhibiting properties have now been found, i.e. novel l9 thio androstane derivatives having the general formula EMI3.1 and the 4,5 dihydro analogues thereof, whereinR1 H, hydrocarbyl 1 4C , aralkyl 7 9C , aryl 6 9C or acyl derived from an organic carboxylic acid having 1 18 C atoms R2 O, aR4 ssR3 or an acetal group R3 a free, esterified or etherified hydroxyl group andR4 H or hydrocarbyl l 4C and is preferably H and wherein the broken lines indicate the optional presence of a double bond in the 1,2 position and or 6,7 position. The hydrocarbyl l 4C group R1 or R4 can for example be methyl, ethyl, vinyl, ethinyl, propyl, 2 propenyl, butyl and branched analogues thereof. The aralkyl group is, for example, benzyl or phenylethyl. The aryl group is, for example, phony tolyl or xylyl, and is preferably phenyl. R1 is preferably methyl or ethyl and most preferably methyl. R2 is preferably 0. R3, if present, is preferably OH. R4 is preferably H and, when present as hydrocarbyl group, is preferably ethinyl or allyl. The 4,5 dihydro analogues are preferably the 5 H compounds. The acyl group which is optionally present in the 19 substituent or in position 17 can be derived from, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, trimethylacetic acid, phenylacetic acid, cyclopentylpropionic acid, cyclo octyl acetic acid, cyclo octyl carboxylic acid, phenylpropionic acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, pelargonic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, benzoic acid or succinic acid. The acetal group which is optionally present in position 17 can for example be a dialkoxy group, such as dimethoxy, or an alkylenedioxy group, such as ethylenedioxy, propylenedioxy or neopentylenedioxy. The ether group which is optionally present in position 17 can be an alkyl ether, such as a methyl ether, ethyl ether, cyclopentyl ether, cyclohexenyl ether or the like, an aromatic ether, such as, for example, a benzyl ether, or a heterocyclic ether, such as, for example, a tetrahydropyranyl ether. The invention also relates to the use of the novel compounds as agents for inhibiting the biosynthesis of oestrogens, i.e. as aromatase inhibitors.The novel compounds can therefore be used in clinical indications where it is desired that the biosynthesis of oestrogen should be inhibited or suppressed, as has already been indicated above. The invention moreover relates to pharmaceutical preparations having aromatase inhibiting properties, which contain, as the active constituent, one or more of the novel l9 thio androstane derivatives. The novel compounds can be administered in the conventional manner, in combination with pharmaceutical auxiliaries, orally, enterally or locally topically , in the form of tablets, pills, dragees, pastilles, powders, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, suppositories, implants, ointments, creams or lotions. The forms for administration can be prepared in accordance with known galenical procedures. The novel l9 thio androstane derivatives can be prepared in a manner known per se. For example, it is possible to start from a l9 sulphonate for instance, a 19 tosylate or 19 mesylate or a 19 halo derivative for instance 19 bromo or 19 iodo derivative of a 3 oxo 4 or 3 hydroxy A5 androstene and to treat this with a metal salt preferably a lithium sodium or potassium salt of an alkanethiol or of a thiocarboxylic acid.In this way, a 19 alkylthio or 19 acylthio androstane compound is obtained. If this reaction is carried out with potassium thioacetate, the l9 acetylthio compound is obtained, which in itself is again an interesting starting material for the other 19 thio androstane derivatives according to the invention. Hydrolysis of the l9 acetylthio group gives the 19 thiol, which can be reacted with a hydrocarbyl, aralkyl, aryl or acyl halide to give l9 thio androstane derivatives having the desired 19 substituent. Instead of an acyl halide also other functional derivatives of carboxylic acids can be used such as an acyl anhydride. The 19 thiol can also be obtained directly from the l9 sulphonate or 19 halo derivative by reaction with MSH, wherein M is an alkalimetal, preferably sodium. Another method of preparation starts from a 19 aldehyde. First, the 19 aldehyde group of such an androstane derivative is converted to a dialkylthio acetal, after which one alkylthio group of the thioacetal obtained is reductively split off with the aid of a metal hydride, preferably in the presence of a Lewis acid see, for example,Netherlands Patent 6,405,765 . This method is in particular suitable for the preparation of the l9 thio ethers according to the invention. It is also possible to start from a 19 acid and to convert this l9 nor androstane 19 carboxylic acid to the corresponding 19 thiol ester by treatment with N,N dimethylphosphoramidine acid dichloride and triethylamine, followed by an alkanethiol. The thiol ester obtained is thereafter reduced with anLiAlH4 AlC13 mixture in an ether see, for example,Synth. Comm. 9 2 , 91 96 1979 and J.Org.Chem. 32, 1630 1631 1967 . A 19 hydroxy androstane derivative can also be used as a starting material for the preparation of the novel 19 thioandrostane compounds. The 19 hydroxy group can be etherified with an alkanethiol, arylalkanethiol or arylthiol, under the action of trifluoroacetic acid. In this case, in view of the acid character of the thiol compounds, this reaction can also be regarded as an esterification . It is also possible to treat a 19 hydroxy androstane derivative with DCCI dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and an alkanethiol, thereby obtaining l9 alkylthioandrostanes compare, for example, Ber. 107 1974 p. 496 . For the introduction of the 19 hydrocarbyl , 19 aralkyl or 19 arylthio group, the starting material is usually a 3,8 hydroxy A5 androstene derivative, which after the introduction of the 19 thio group is converted into the 3 oxo A4 system by oxidation, for example by Oppenaueroxidation. For the introduction of a 19 mercapto or l9 acylthio group, the starting material is usually a 3 oxo Åa4 androstene derivative or the 4,5 dihydro analogue thereof. After introduction of the l9 thio group, the substituents desired elsewhere in the steroid skeleton can still be introduced. A 1 and or 6 can, if desired, be introduced with the aid of chloranil or DDQ dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone . The substituents in position 17 can still be introduced or modified. For example, a 17 hydroxy group can be oxidised to the 17 oxo group by theOppenauer method or with chromium trioxide. A 17 oxo group present can, if desired, be reduced to a 17 hydroxy group, for example with the aid of a complex metal hydride, such as sodium borohydride, in alkaline methanol, or be converted to the desired acetal group by reaction with, for example, ethylene glycol or 1,3 propanediol in the presence of triethyl orthoformate and paratoluenesulphonic acid. The introduction of a hydrocarbyl group at position 17 is carried out by reacting the 17 oxo steroid with a metal derivative of a saturated or an unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon, if necessary followed by a further conversion of the side chain thus introduced, e.g. reduction of an unsatllrated group to a less unsaturated or a saturated group The metal derivative may be a Grignard compound, for example the magnesium bromide of the hydrocarbon concerned or an alkyl lithium compound.A particular form of the condensation reaction for producing the 17ss hydroxy 17a alkynyl compounds consists in that the 17 oxo steroid is reacted with a triple unsaturated hydrocarbon in the presence of an alkalimetal or an alkalimetal compound, for example an alkalimetal amide or alcoholate or with an alkalimetal or earthalkalimetal compound of a triple unsaturated hydrocarbon. The ester group in position 17 may be introduced by a method known per se, for example by reacting the 17B hydroxy steroid with the acid concerned or a functional derivative thereof such as the anhydride or the halide or by reacting the reaction product obtained by the condensation of the 17 oxo steroid with a metal derivative of an unsaturated hydrocarbon radical without preliminary hydrolysis with the acid concerned or a functional derivative thereof. Esterification may, as an alternative, be performed by reacting the steroid with a carboxylic acid anhydride such as acetic acid anhydride in the presence of 4 dimethyl aminopyridine, preferably also in the presence of a tertiary amine such as trimethylamine. Etherification of the 17ss hydroxyl group may be performed according to standard procedures.Alkylethers may be prepared by reacting the 17 hydroxy compound with an alkylhalide, e.g.methyl iodide or ethyl iodide, in the presence of silver oxide or silver carbonate or in the presence of NaH in dimethylsulfoxide or tetrahydrofuran. The tetrahydropyranyl ether can be obtained by reacting the 170 hydroxy steroid with dihydropyran in the presence of p toluene sulphonic acid in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. The 4,5 dihydro compounds may be obtained by reduction of the corresponding A4 compound, e.g.by hydrogenation on Pd C, giving a mixture of 5a H and 5ss H compounds, which may be separated, e.g. by chromatography. Preferably, the 4,5 dihydro 5a H compound is obtained by hydrogenation of a 3ss OH 5 derivative, giving the 3ss OH Sa H compound, whereafter the 3B OH group is oxidised to the 3 oxo group, e.g. with chromic acid Jones oxidation .

Example XIV a In a nitrogen atmosphere a mixture of 4 g of 19 hydroxy 4 androstene 3,17 dione 19 tosylate Steroids 4, 1964, p. 1 and 5 g of potassium thioacetate in 70 ml of dimethylformamide were stirred for 16 hours at 100 OC After cooling and pouring out in water the mixture was extracted with methylene dichloride tetrahydrofuran. Evaporation of the extracts and chromatography of the residue gave 1.55 g of 19 acetylthio 4 androstene 3,l7 dione, oil with a 20 170.20 dioxane .b In a nitrogen atmosphere 0.5 g of NaOCH3 were added to a stirred solution of 3.1 g of l9 acetylthio A4 androstene 3,l7 dione in 155 ml of methanol. After stirring for 30 minutes the reaction mixture was neutralised with acetic acid 50 and poured out into ice water. The precipitate was sucked off and crystallised from methylene dichloride diethyl ether. 4Yield 1.72 g of 19 mercapto A androstene 3,l7 dione, melting point 141 143 OC, L D20 1420 dioxane .c In a way similar to that described in ExampleVII 1 g of 19 mercapto 4 androstene 3,17 dione was reduced to give 0.57 g of 178 hydroxy 19 mercapto A4 androsten 3 dione, melting point 113 115 OC 20 65.20 dioxane . D Example XV Acetylene was introduced into a suspension of 5.9 g potassium t. butoxide in 26 ml of tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature between 0 C and 5 OC and for 30 minutes. To this mixture a solution of 1.5 g of 3ss hydroxy 19 methylthio A5 androsten 17 one in 15 ml tetrahydrofuran was added, whereafter for 45 minutes acetylene was led through the reaction mixture. Excess acetylene was swept out of the mixture with nitrogen, whereafter the mixture was neutralised with 2 N sulphuric acid.Extraction with methylene dichloride, evaporation of the extracts and chromatography of the residue gave 0.5 g of 17a ethinyl 19 methylthio A5 androstene 3ss,17ss diol, which on Oppenauer oxidation according to the method described in Example I c gave 17a ethinyl 17 3 hydroxy l9 methylthio 4 androsten 3 one. Example XVI Hydrogen was led through a solution of 0.5 g of 3ss hydroxy 19 methylthio 5 androsten 17 one in 100 ml of methanol in the presence of 0.1 g of prehydrogenatedPd C 10 . After the reaction the catalyst was filtered off and the filtrate evaporated until small volume.Chromatography of the residue yielded 3ss hydroxy 19 methylthio 5a androstan 17 one, which on oxidation in 50 ml of acetone with 0.5 ml of 8 N chromic acid solution, addition of methanol, pouring out in water, extraction and chromatography gave 19 methylthio 5a androstane 3 , 17 dione.
