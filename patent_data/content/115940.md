# Film forming propylene copolymer, film thereof and process for production of the film.

## Abstract
A film forming propylene copolymer composed of a major amount of propylene and a minor amount of ethylene, char acterized by having A an ethylene content Ec of from 0.1 mole to 2.0 mole based on the total amount of propylene and ethylene, and B an isotactic value Iso in the range represented by the following formula 1 or 2 , i when 0.1 Ec 0.3, Iso 5Ec 96.3 ..... 1 , and ii when 0.3 Ec 2.0, Iso 0.67Ec 95.0 ..... 2 wherein Ec represents the numerical value of Ec mole a film of the copolymer and a process for producing the film.
