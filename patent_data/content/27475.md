## Description
IMPROVED TAP WASHEPS The present invention relates to an improved valve washer and in particular to an improved tap washer. In one broad form the invention comprises a material suitable as a valve washer comprising an elastomeric core with one surface thereof bonded to a layer of polyolefin. In a preferred form of the invention the polyolefin is bonded to both sides of the elastomeric core. High density polyethylene is suitable for the present invention. However, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene was found to be the preferred polymeric material especially when the core is vulcanised rubber. The properties of one ultra high molecular weight polyethylene having the Registered Trademark TUFFCLAD is as follows Material Static Kinetic Test MethodMild Steel vs. Mild Steel .30 .40 .25 .35 ASTMMild Steel vs. TUFFCLAD .15 .20 .12 .20 D 1894TUFFCLAD vs. TUFFCLAD .20 .30 .20 .30 Comparison of Dynamic Coefficient of Friction on Polished SteelProperty TUFFCLAD POLYLEFIN Nylon 6 6 Nylon 6 Teflon Delrin Nylatron GSDry .10 .22 .15 .40 .15 .40 .04 .25 .15 .35 .12 .20Water .05 .10 .14 .19 .14 .19 .04 .08 .10 .20 .10 .12Oil .05 .08 .02 .11 .02 .11 .04 .05 .05 .10 .08 .10 Sand Slurry Abrasion Tests were carried out under the following conditions Slurry 2 parts water, 3 parts sand 0.3 to 1.0mm, 0.008 to 0.04 Test specimen 1 x 3 x 1 4 Rotational speed of test specimen 1200 rpm. Test period 24 hours Temperature of apparatus increases to 120 F. The following table gives an indication of the abrasion resistance of TUFFCLAD. A value of 100 was designated for the amount of volumetric abrasion loss to the TUFFCLAD specimen.The values shown for other materials are those of volumetric loss compared to TUFFCLAD. The higher the figure, the more abrasion loss.Material Specific Gravity g cm3 Relative Volumetric AbrasionAcetal copolymer 1.42 700Beechwood 0.83 2700Carbon Steel 7.45 160Epoxy resin 1.53 3400TUFFCLAD POLYOLEFIN 0.94 100Low density polyethylene 0.92 600Phenolic resin 1.40 2500Plexiglas 1.31 1800Polypropylene 0.90 660Polyvinyl chloride PVC 1.33 920TFE 2.26 530TFE 25 Glass Fiber 2.55 570 As Tuffclad has self lubricating and high slip properties its suitability for bonding to elastomeric materials was unsuspected. However, during experimentation it was surprisingly found that a layer of Tuffclad was bonded onto a sheet of rubber during the normal vulcanising step and forming a strong bond between the rubber and the Tuffclad . The resulting bond is such that during reported deformation tests there appeared to be no separation between the Tuffclad and the rubber. In a typical vulcanising process the uncured core is placed between two sheets of the high density polyethylene and the thus layered uncured sheet placed in an autoclave to cure for 6 8 hours at a temperature of about 5000F. Thus the present invention provides a washer having a non hydroscopic wear face with the resiliency of an elastomeric material.
