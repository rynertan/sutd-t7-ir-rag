# Machine for providing a layer of stiffening material on a selected area of a shoe upper component.

## Abstract
In a machine for applying a plurality of blobs of molten thermoplastics material to a heel end portion of a closed shoe upper and for thereafter pressing the heel end portion, while the material remains flowable, to cause the blobs to be spread to form a continuous layer which, when cooled, provides a stiffener for the heel end portion, an applicator 16 , mounted on an extruder 45 , is brought into an operative position and extrusion is initiated, during which the applicator is caused to pivot about a transverse axis 76 , that the blobs are applied in elongated form. For lined shoes, lining spreading means 92 , also pivotally mounted on the extruder 45 , comprises a first element 39 folding back the lining to expose the upper to the applicator, and a second element 38 which, during pivotal movement together with the applicator, spreads the lining progressively against the now coated upper. For accommodating shoes of different sizes, the applicator 16 has a main portion 40 and two sets of wing portions 41, 42 each pivotable to an out of the way position. Each portion 40, 41, 42 has a plurality of orifices 17 in the out of the way position, these are automatically disconnected.
