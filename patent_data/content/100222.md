# Process for dehydrogenating hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Hydrocarbons such as normal paraffins with 4 to 30 car bon atoms are dehydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst containing a noble metal of group VIII e.g. platinum , a metal of group VIIB or IVA e.g. rhenium or germanium and a metal of group IA. Hydrogen and ammonia are added to the feed.
