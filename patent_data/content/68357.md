# Vinyl chloride resin composition.

## Abstract
A latex of a highly crosslinked butadiene rubber poly mer comprising not less than 50 of butadiene 1.0 to 10 of a crosslinking agent and a remainder of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer copolymerizable with butadiene, and having a particle size of 600 to 3,000 Ã… and a degree of swelling of not greater than 7 is obtained by one or more stages of emulsion polymerization. By polymerizing 15 to 30 parts of a monomer mixture of an alkyl methacrylate, an aromatic vinyl monomer, and optionally a crosslinking ag ent and an unsaturated nitrile in the presence of 85 to 70 parts of the rubber polymer, a graft copolymer is obtained. A composition comprising 2 to 40 of this graft copolymer and 98 to 60 of a vinyl chloride resin possesses high impact resistance coupled with improved stress whitening resistance, which properties cannot be easily obtained at the same time in conventional resin compositions.
