The pores of the body are filled with a composition 12 consisting wholly or partially of an active material, The device may be provided with a low solubility coating 13 . On immersion in an aqueous medium the glass 11 dissolves to become a sponge like structure having a plurality of convoluted capillaries and from which the active material is released.
