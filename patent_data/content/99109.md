# Process for preparing free flowing ethylcellulose microcapsules.

## Abstract
A process for preparing free flowing microcapsules by taking advantage of the phase separation of ethylcellulos in cyclohexane is disclosed. In this process, a hydrocarbon compound which is soluble in cyclohexane and have a molecular weight of 150 to 3,000 and a solubility parameter δ, at 25 C of 7 to 10 cal cm³
