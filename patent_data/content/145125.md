# TILT SENSOR NULL ADJUSTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A null adjusting tool for aligning a tilt sensor of the electrolytic liquid type to the vertical is provided. A sensor mounting plate 13 with a tilt sensing element 16 attached thereto is rotated about a pivot pin 14 by the rotation of a coarse 33 and fine 34 adjustment screw. The coarse adjustment screw 33 acts directly on the sensor mounting plate 13 . The fine adjustment screw 34 provides a high degree of position resolution control through a combination of screw thread and lever type mechanical advantage. A digital readout 52 containing a liquid crystal display and self contained power source is mounted on the null adjusting tool to provide a visual indication of the angular deviation of the tilt sensor from the vertical during the alignment process.
