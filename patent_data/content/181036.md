## Description
Support for suspending a bicycle or the like from a wall. The invention relates to a support for suspending a bicyle or the like from a wall, comprising a base that is attachable to the wall, a supporting arm extending from said base and a hook like catching member positioned at the end of the supporting arm. A known support of this type has a base consisting of a square plate that is connected to the supporting arm, e.g. by means of a welded joint. The hook like catching member is also connected to the sup orting arm, e.g. by means of a welded joint. A disadvantage of this known support is that it forms an inconvenient obstacle against which one can painfully knock oneself, especially when the bicycle or the like has been removed from the support. It is an object of the invention to provide a support of the type mentioned before solving this problem in an easy but nevertheless effective way. Therefore the support according to the invention is characterized in that the supporting arm is pivotable between a working position, in which the supporting arm extends substantially perpendicularly to the wall, and a resting position, in which the supporting arm extends substantially parallel to the wall. As a result the possibility is obtained to place the support in its resting position when it does not support a bicycle or the like, so that it projects only slightly from the wall and does not longer form an inconvenient obstacle. Preferably the catching member is rotatable around a longitudinal axis of the supporting arm. Due to this rotatability an adjustability of the support results, that is very handy especially when two supports are being applied for suspending a bicycle.Definitively attached to the wall every support due to this can be adapted to several bicycle dimensions. A simple but nevertheless stable pivotability of the support can be obtained when the base comprises a pivot pin around which the supporting arm can pivot and at least one bearing surface for supporting the supporting arm in the c ring position ard or resting position. Moreover, when the pivot pin constitutes a horizontal pivot axis, the support has an extremely stable working position, in which the bicycle or the like is held onto its place in a favourable way. The invention will be elucidated further hereafter with reference to the drawing that shows an embodiment of the support according to the invention. Fig. 1 shows two supports according to the invention attached to a wall and supporting a bicycle frame fig. 2 is a perspective view of a support according to the invention fig. 3 is a longitudinal section of a support according to the invention in its working position fig. 4 is a longitudinal section of a support according to the invention in its resting position, and fig, 5 shows a top plan view of the hook like catching member of the support according to the invention. In fig. 1 two supports 1 are illustrated that are attached to a wall 2 and that support a bicycle frame 3. As appears clearly from fig. 2 each support 1 is built up from a base 4 that can be connected to the wall 2, a supporting arm 5 extending from the base 4 and being formed out of a tube with a square cross section, and a hook like catching member 6 placed at the end of the supporting arm. The supporting arm 5 is pivotable between a working position, in which it extends substantially perpendicularly to the wall 2, and a resting position represented in dotted lines in fig. 2, in which the supporting arm 5 extends substantially parallel to the wall 2. For ensuring the pivotability of the supporting arm 5 the base 4 comprises a pivot pin 7 that is supported in two wall sections 8 of the base 4 and that forms a horizontal pivot axis. This pivot pin 7 can exist of a simple nut bolt joint but other designs are also possible. A releasable pivot pin 7 is preferred because it is possible than to release the supporting arm 5 from the base 4. The connection of the base 4 to the wall 2 can be carried out with the usual screws, bolts etc, that fit into recesses 9 of the base 4. The hook like catching member 6 comprises a catchopening 10 for receiving for example a tubular part of a bicycle. For stable placing of the supporting arm 5, in the resting position as well as in the working position, it is important that the base 4 comprises at least one bearing surface for supporting the supporting arm 5. As appears from fig. 3 and 4 in the shown embodiment of the support 1 the base 4 therefore comprises two horizontal bearing surfaces 11 and 12, respectively, positioned above and below the plane of the pivot pin, respectively, for supporting the supporting arm 5 in the working position and a vertical bearing surface 13, that together with the horizontal bearing surface 12 is meant for supporting the supporting arm 5 in the resting position. SO r the horizontal bearing surface 12 has a supporting function in the resting position as well as in the working position. The supporting arm 5 comprises at its end facing away from the catching member 6 a closed slot 14 entirely passing through said end, said slot in the working position of the supporting arm 5 as illustrated in fig. 3, extending horizontally over some distance. This slot has a slot width that is at least equal to the diameter of the pivot pin 7. When the supporting arm 5 has to be pivoted from its working position fig. 3 into its resting position fig. 4 it is at first drawn out of the base 4 over some distance, thereby displacing the pivot pin 7 through the slot 14. After the supporting arm 5 has been shifted in this way over a distance big enough it can be pivoted into its resting position, whereby its end facing away from the catching member 6 can move along the lower bearing surface 12 without restrictions, without this bearing surface 12 obstructing the pivotal motion. After the pivotal motion of the supporting arm 5 has been completed and this engaging the vertical bearing surface 13, the supporting arm 5 can be moved downwards until it rests with its end facing away from the catching member 6 on the lower bearing surface 12. The slot 14 has at its end facing towards the catching member a slot portion 15 extending upwards in the working position. In the working position of the support 1 the pivot pin 7 rests in this slot portion 15. For this reason the supporting arm 5 has a slight motional freedom relative to the base 4 of which the two bearing surfaces 11 and 12 therefore do not enclose the supporting arm 5 with a close fit. Because a load applied to the catching member 6 presses the pivot pin 7 firmly into the slot portion 15, it is not possible to displace the supporting arm 5 relative to the base 4 without restrictions.For this reason the supporting arm 5 has to be raised at first so that the pivot pin 7 will be aligned with the slot 14 whereafter it is possible to shift the supporting arm 5. Moreover the slot 14 comprises between its two ends a slot portion 16 extending downwards in the working position of the supporting arm 5, see fig. 3. As appears from fig. 4, the pivot pin 7 in the resting position rests in this slot portion 16. As a result a rotation of the supporting arm 5 is obstructed this rotation can, however, take place when the supporting arm 5 will be shifted at first over a short distance in the direction facing away from the wall 2, thereby placing the pivot pin 7 in the slot 14. Therefore the two slot portions 15 and 16 contribute to a stable placing of the supporting arm 5 in the working position and the resting position, respectively. The catching member 6 can be rotated around a longitudinal axis of this supporting arm 5 and is provided with a cylindrical neck 17 that enables this rotation and that can be placed into a recess of the supporting arm 5. This cylindrical neck 17 is provided with a roundgoing groove 18, wherein between the end of the neck 17 and the roundgoing groove 18 a groove or flattening 19 extends in the longitudinal direction of the neck 17. The supporting arm 5 comprises a boss 20 projecting inwards into the neck 17 receiving recess, said boss being movable into the roundgoing groove 18 for rotatably locking the catching member 6 in the supporting arm 5. For placing the catching member 6 into the supporting arm 5 the flattening 19 has to be aligned with the boss 20, whereafter the catching member 6 can be moved with its neck 17 into the recess in the supporting arm 5. By thereupon rotating the catching member 6, the boss 20 is brought into the roundgoing groove 18 and the catching member 6 is rotatably locked into the supporting arm 5. Because the catching member 6 is mounted rotatably in the supporting arm 5 the position of the catching member 6 can be adapted to differently formed bicycle frames or the like. Preferably, the base 4 and the catching member 6 of the support 1 are made of plastic, wherein the supporting arm 5 is manufactured from metal. A firm base 4 can be obtained by manufacturing it from nylon. The invention is not limited to the embodiment described before, but can be varied widely within the scope of the invention.
