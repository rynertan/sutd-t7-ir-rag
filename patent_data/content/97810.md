## Description
SiZYIEWBASED SHAIO The importance of perfect and balanced cellular,glandular and vascular functioninQ of the scalp is well known for the growth and naintenance of abundant, well distributed hair.In this respect, the sebaceous gland cells perform a basic function. On disintegrating in their central part, they transfer their constituent fats into the pilo sebaceous duct, so lubricating the hair and the cutaneous surface.When the sebaceous and sudoriferous Glands function abnornall they produce a greater number of fatty substances which e re the scalp, and consequently the hair disposed thereon bright and greasy.In this case it is important to maintain continuous deep cleaning, prevent degeneration of the already secreted sebum, and prevent irritation and bad odours arising, in order to prevent the hair from growing thin and weak on what is already a difficult surface, with the result that the individual hairs split easily and easily separate from the follicle under the smallest tension.The lipids which represent the fatty substances of the hair and scalp mostly consist of various ratty acids bonded to glycerin, but also consist partly of an entire series of alcohols which give them characteristics similar to waxes. The average composition of such lipids is given hereinafter 14. Gloor Determination and analysis of sebum on skin and hairs, Cosmetic Science, Volume I, 225 Academic Press 1978 Waxy substances triglycerides 34.65 free fatty acids 20.89 cholesterol waxes and esters 19.02 free cholesterol 8.72Liquids squalene 10.96 paraffins 5.75These compounds are difficult to eliminate because of their structure.During normal functioning of the hair system, the bonded fatty substances are split by the effect of other substances present in the organism, and thus also in the pilo sebaceous ducts, i.e. lipolytic enzymes or lipase. Lipase splits the fats into alcohols and fatty acids, which are more easily removed from the hair by normal washing, the former, i.e. the alcohols, because they are soluble in water1 and the latter1 i.e. the fats, because they easily saponify with the bases present on the tissues sodium, potassium, ammonium ions as normal constituents or as a product of their metabolism.However, in many cases these endogenous lipases are either in an insufficient quantity and therefore do not solve the problem, or are in excess and lead to other drawbacks excess of free fatty acids which can give rise to irritation .In general, in removing fats bonded into complex molecules, it is necessary to use preparations of energetic action, which are poorly soluble and are also aggressive towards the other constituent substances of the hair structure.It is therefore important to carry out a cleaning process which follows the natural physiological mechanisms by introducing into the shampoo an enzyme having a demolishing action on sebaceous fats. Prom this aspect, it seemed interesting to use lipase.However, lipase as in the case of all enzymes possesses very precise and rather restricted stability limits. It is sensitive to heat action, to moisture and to a large number of chemical agents, and acts within very narrow pH limits.For all these reasons, and the resultant difficulty of preserving the final product, the use of enzymes and in particular lipase has been relegated up to the present time to improvised preparations made up by qualified personnel when required.The object of the present invention is to provide a shampoo containing lipase, in which none of the other ingredients cause degradation of the lipase, and thus enable its enzymatic activity to be preserved unaltered with time. A product of reliable action is therefore provided containing substances of perfect tolerability able to exert a specific action in those cases in which it is necessary to remove the excess sebum from the hair without the use of energetic treatment. The critical elements which enable the lipase based shampoo to be prepared, and on which the new formulation according to the invention is therefore based are as follows 1 absence of water 2 use of non ionic surface active agents 3 detergent action exerted without foam fornation. ltith regard to the absence of water, it is already knon that this latter has a negative effect on the stability of lipase.From the vast amount of experimental work carried out, it has been found that no aqueous composition containing lipase has a stability in terms of this latter which exceeds seven days at ambient temperature or fifteen days at 4 C. With regard to the requirement of no foam formation, it has been found that when the air phase breaks the liquid enzyme interface, there is a considerable reduction in enzymatic activity. This factor has therefore been considered very important in formulating the product. With regard to the choice of the surface active agent, this is of fundamental importance in that it constitutes a critical aspect of the formulation according to the present invention, as it has to satisfy the stated requirements, i.e. absence of water in the formulation and absence of foaming effect by the surface active agent.The various classes of surface active agents normally used in the hair cleaning field were tried, namely anionic, amphoteric, cationic and non ionic.The use of surface active agents is essential for hair cleaning.In this respect, substances of high surface active power disperse in the aqueous solution used, to form micelles which embrace the particles present, whether these are of cutaneous production or of exogenous origin. These micelles therefore enable all undesirable components to be separated from the scalp and from the stem of the hair, these components being made more easily removable by enzymatic splitting. early all products tested were found unusable for the purpose of the present invention, in that they are available only in aqueous solution either to facilitate their use or because of synthesis requirements.If however anhydrous products are used, it is found that the presence of anionic surface active agents, either alone or associated with other classes of surface active agents leads to a reduction in lipase activity.Likewise, cationic compounds have been found to be poisons for the category of enzymes tested, because of their activity as modifiers of the reactivity of the enzyme protein components. Amphoteric components were found to be suitable for association with enzymes where the pH of the medium was close to neutrality. However, these surface active agents result in very compact and lasting foam, and thus during use they inhibit enzymatic activity because of the foam produced.It has been found, and represents a subject matter of the present invention, that there exists a limited group of nonionic surface active agents which act as dispersants for lipolytic enzymes, do not produce appreciable foam during use, and do not alter enzymatic activity with time, thus possessing all the requirements necessary for preparing the enzymatic shampoo according to the present invention. ore specifically, the following non ionic surface active agents, free from peroxides, have proved suitable for the formulations according to the invention sorbitan fatty acid esters, either oxyethylenated or not glucose fatty acid esters, either oxyethylenated or not saccharose fatty acid esters, either oxyethylenated or not pentaertjtol at esters, either oxyehylenated or not glycerol fatty acid esters, either oxyethylenated or not derivatives of C8 to C , chain alcohols1 including branched alcohols with the saturated and unsaturated bonds oxy ethylenated oxyethylenated alkylphenols oxyethylenated derivatives of lanolin alcohols oxyethylenated derivatives of lanolin esters oxyethylenated derivatives of beeswax.Of the aforesaid series of products, the following have been found preferable oxyethylenated sorbitan fatty acid esters saccharose fatty acid esters oxyethylenated glycerol fatty acid esters oxyethylenated derivatives of saturated and unsaturated C16 C18 chain alcohols oxyethylenated alkylphenols oxyethylenated derivatives of lanolin alcohols.The shampoo according to the present invention is therefore constituted by a formulation in which the following are present as essential constituents a one or more non ionic surface active agents chosen from those listed heretofore as suitable b a lipase, which can be of pancreatic, vegetable or fungal type.The concentration of the components under point a is mainly related to appearance requirements. The minimum quantity necessary is 8 10 . The lipase concentration can also vary between wide limits.The minimum necessary quantity is estimated at 5000 Int.units per 100 grams of product.The formulation, which can be in liquid or semi solid form, can comprise other ingredients such as perfumes, diluents, excipients and the like, which do not interfere with the two stated essential constituents, and thus must not contain water.They can also serve to give the product the required consistency.The lipase preferred in the formulations according to the invention is fungal lipase because of its high activity and versatility.Pancreatic lipase obtained from slaughtered animals is less advisable. Because of its origin, the possibility of allergic cutaneous reactions cannot be excluded.Vegetable lipase, obtained from wheat germ, is better from the tolerability aspect, but its activity is weak and it is very costly.Formulation examples of shampoos according to the invention are given hereinafter for illustrative purposes only.
