# Apparatus for providing depletion free uniform thickness cvd thin film on semiconductor wafers.

## Abstract
Apparatus for forming depletion free uniform thickness CVD thin film on semiconductor wafers. The apparatus includes a boat loader coupled to a diffusion furnace for loading and removing a batch of semiconductor wafers 80 into and out of the furnace, and a semiconductor wafer support boat 66 for removably retaining a plurality of vertically oriented semiconductor wafers 80 on the boat 66 . The semiconductor wafer support boat 66 preferably includes two laterally spaced elongated rails 68, 70 each having an undulatory longitudinal section defining plural ridge portions 72 spaced apart by plural valley portions 74 . The ridges 72 on one of the rails are provided with transverse slots 78 that cooperate with confronting transverse slots 78 provided on the confronting ridge portions on the other one of the rails to define a plurality of wafer edge receiving channels. The valley portions 74 effectively shift the depletion zone away from each wafer edge receiving channel. The system may advantageously be employed for low temperature photochemical and photosensitized vacuum chemical vapor deposition processes.
