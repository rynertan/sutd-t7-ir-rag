# Pickup head position control device in an optical type disc reproducing device.

## Abstract
A pickup head position control device in an optical type disc reproducing device controls a pickup head position for a search operation for selection of a music piece. In this device, a tracking servo control is periodically switched on and off while an optical head is forcibly moved toward a target position by driving a feed motor, a tracking actuator is deviated in the moving direction of the optical head by supplying a kick pulse to the tracking actuator when the tracking servo is off, and reading of a disc address is effected to conduct a search of a target position when the tracking servo is on.
