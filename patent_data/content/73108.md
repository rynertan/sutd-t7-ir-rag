## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE RECOVERY OF METALS This invention relates to a process for the recovery of metals from solutions containing them. Particularly, but not exclusively, it relates to a process for recovering gold, silver, platinum or other precious metals in a pure form by means of a reduction reaction using as reducing agent a polyhydroxyl compound. The process can be applied, for example, to alloys, drosses, scrap, ores, mattes or organo metallic complexes where these materials can conveniently be brought into solution. The process can be used to replace the conventional pyrometallurgical and electro refining processes commonly used in the precious metal refining industry. The polyhydroxyl compound, which can be aliphatic or aromatic, can be one having two, three, four or more hydroxyl groups, and the hydroxyl groups can include primary or secondary hydroy.yl groups. Any primary hydroxyl group can be, for example, in the form of an alkylol or other primary hydroxyl group. Where the polyhydroxyl compound is aliphatic it is conveniently a compound containing only primary hydroxyl groups or both primary and secondary hydroxyl groups0Polyhydroxyl compounds with which the invention is particularly concerned are sugars for example in monosaccharide or di saccharide form which term includes derivatives, for example gamma and other lactone derivatives. Examples of suitable mono sacoharides are hexoses, for instance glucose, though other forms of mono saccharides can be used. Another suitable type of polyhydroxyl compounds com prises polyhydroxyl alcohols, for example alcohols having at least one primary hydroxyl group attached to a terminal carbon atom. lfihere the polyhydroxyl alcohol is one having two primary hydroxyl groups it can be, for example, one in which the hydroxyl groups are separated by three, four or more linear chain carbon atoms. An example of an alpha omega dihydroxyl alcohol of this type is 93rbitol. If the polyhydroxyl compound is one capable of forming water soluble salts, for instance a compound containing a carboxylic group or a compound capable of existing in enolic form, the polyhydroxyl compound can be used in the form of such a salt. In a preferred form of the invention the polyhydroxyl compound is an ascorbic acid compound, for exampleL ascorbic acid, D iso ascorbic acid, salts thereof or related polyhydroxyl compounds having a lactone ring of the ascorbic acid type. The following description relates in particular to the use of B ascorbic acid0 The process of the invention is applicable in particular to gold, silver and platinum but it can be applied also, for example, to precious metals of GroupVIII of Mendeleeff s Periodic Table, for instance palladium, rhodium, ruthenium and iridiumO In general, the process is of greatest interest for use where the metal to be recovered is in a mono valent form, though it can be used when the metal is in divalent form or even a higher valency state.The process is applicable, for instance, to the recovery of gold or silver from aqueous solutions containing base metals such as copper and or nickel, The pH selected for the aqueous solution of the metal to be recovered depends to a large extent on what metals, if any, besides the metal intended to be recovered are present in the solution. For example, for the recovery of gold or silver from an aqueous solution containing also copper and or nickel a pH in the range 2 5 especially 3.0 to 4.5 or 9 12 especially 9.5 10.5 , respectively, is suitable. Suitable concentrations of the gold or silver are in the range 0.4 2.5 molar, for example 1.4 or other values in the range 1.0 1.8. It is preferable, particularly where ascorbic acid is used as the polyhydroxyl compound, that the process be carried out under conditions such that no appreciable amount of nitrous acid is formed, otherwise there is a danger of the ascorbic acid being prematurely oxidized0 The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples which relate to embodiments of the process of the invention. EXAMPIE 1 This Example describes a process for the recovery of silver in the form of a powder from scrap metal containing silver, copper, zinc and nickel. One kgD of the scrap was dissolved in 2.32 kg. of 59 w v nitric acid. Irlhen the reaction had ceased, the solution was sampled and analysed for silver. The analysis results showed a silver content of 909 gm. in the original scrap material. The silver solution was diluted to a volume of 5 litres with de ionised water and the pH adjusted to 4.5 with 25 ammonium hydroxide solution. Throughout the pH adjustment, the silver solution was vigorously stirred. The silver solution, now at pH 4.5, was then filtered and to the filtrate was added 741 gm. of L ascorbic acid in approximately 150 gm. portions over a period of 6 minutes. The solution was thoroughly mixed during the precipitation but no vortex was allowed to entrain air into the solution. After the last addition of ascorbic acid, the supernatant liquor was tested for the presence of silver ions with saturated sodium chloride solution.The precipitated silver was then separated from the supernatant liquor in a basket type centrifuge fitted with a polypropylene bag. The silver was washed with cold water until the washings, tested by Merck papers, showed no copper, nickel or zinc. The metal was then washed with one litre of de ionised water at 80 0C and allowed to spin until no liquid was discernible at the centrifuge drain. The metal powder was then dried at 10005 in vacuo for 6 hours. The final yield of silver powder was 908 gm. and subsequent analyses showed a purity of 99 e 99 f silver. ByRmPLE 2 This Example describes a process for the recovery of gold in the form of a powder from scrap metal containing gold, silver, copper and nickel, 500 grn. of the scrap was digested with 205 litres of aqua regia, with constant stirring. The resulting solution was diluted to a volume of 6 litres with water and filtered0 The filtrate was analysed for gold which showed a gold content of 35,7 in the original scrap. The silver chloride retained on the filter was reserved for silver recovery. To the filtrate was added 900 ml. of a 20 w v solution of L ascorbic acid over a period of 15 minutes, with vigorous stirring, no vortex being allowed to entrain air in the solution. When the ascorbic acid addition had been completed, the supernatant liquor was tested for gold ions by the Stannous chloride method purple of Cassius . 2 he precipitate of gold was separated from the supernatant liquor in a basket type centrifuge fitted with a polypropylene bag. The precipitate was washed with 1.2 litres of 5 w v hydrochloric acid solution at a temperature of 800C, and then with cold water until the washings were negative when tested with Merck copper and nickel papers,Finally, the precipitate was washed with one litre of 0 de ionised water at 80 C. 0 The gold powder was dried at 100 C in vacuo for four hours. The final yield of gold powder was 178.1 gm. and subsequent analyses showed a purity of 99.9 c gold. EXM.4PIE 3 101.7 kg. of impure metallic silver flake , which had been recovered electrolytically from a photographic process fixing solution, was dissolved in nitric acid.The resulting solution was filtered to remove insolubles and the filtrate analysed for silver content. The result showed a silver content of 79,96 silver. The filtrate pH was adjusted to 2.85 with aqueous ammonium hydroxide and the silver concentration adjusted to approximtely 0.75M with de ionised water.To the resulting solution was added 67keg. of Lascorbic acid at the approximate rate of 5 kg. of ascorbic acid per minute, the solution being vigorously stirred during and after the addition A sample of the liquors was tested for silver ions with saturated sodium chloride to check on completeness of precipitation. The slurry of precipitated silver was pumped to a basket type centrifuge fitted with a polypropylene bag.The cake was washed for 10 minutes in the centrifuge with cold water and finally with 140 litres of de ionised water at 800C. The cake was spun until no further liquid was discernible at the centrifuge drain. The damp cake was then melted in an induction furnace and the molten silver poured into ingot moulds to produce ingots weighing approximately 20 kg. each. The total weight of silver ingots produced was 81.12 kge and the purity of each ingot was not less than 99,96 silver. EXAMPLE 4 51 kg. of silver chloride contaminated withFi iodofluorescien and potassium chloride was slurried in 16 aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution by vigorous stirring. The temperature was raised from 18 0C to 22 0C, and 39 kg. of L ascorbic acid added at the rate of 3kg. of ascorbic acid per minute. The temperature rose to approximately 26 0C during this operation. The silver slurry was centrifuged and the cake was melted and poured as an ingot, as described inExample 3. The total weight of silver ingots produced was 35.90 kg. and the purity of each ingot was not less than 99.99 silver. The weight of silver in the original weight of silver chloride, determined by analysis was 36.05 kg. EXAMPLE 5 242.51 kg. of silver ore concentrates from a large mining operation, containing other metallic compounds as impurities, these being primarily lead and zinc compounds, was digested with 1000 kg. of 59 Nitric acid for 3 hours at an initial temperature of 700C. The temperature was allowed to rise to 105 0C by the end of the digestion period. The resulting solution of metal nitrates was pumped to a holding vessel and diluted to a volume of 850 litres with de ionised water.The pH was then adjusted to 3 with ammonium hydroxide solution. Samples of the solution were analysed for silver content. The partially neutralised solution was filtered and the filtrate was cooled to 15 C. To the cooled filtrate was added 74 kg. of 1, ascorbic acid at the rate of 5 kg. per minute. This addition was based upon the result of the analysis above. Vigorous stirring of the filtrate was maintained throughout the addition options, but no air was allowed to be entrained in the solution. The temperature of the filtrate slurry rose to 240C during the addition period. The silver slurry was centrifuged as before, but 250 litres of de ionised water at 80 0C were used in the final wash. The centrifuge cake was melted as before and cast into ingots. The final weight of silver ingots was 90.43 kg. and the purity of each ingot was not less than 99.97 silver. The weight of silver in the original weight of concentrates, determined by analysis was 91.15keg.
