# Improvements in or relating to radar systems employing two kinds of pulses.

## Abstract
In a radar system frequency modulated transmitter pulses of relatively long duration and frequency modulated transmitter pulses of relatively short duration are generated and transmitted through a common transmitter channel. The receiver comprises a first and a second receiving channel, both channels containing a pulse compression filter, for the detection of return signals from the transmitter pulses of relatively long duration and of relatively short duration respectively.
