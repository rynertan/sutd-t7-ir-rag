# A probe and a system for detecting wear of refractory wall.

## Abstract
A probe for detecting wear of a refractory wall, including a plural number of sheathed probe elements of different lengths each consisting of a pair of parallelly disposed high melting point wires insulated from each other except at least the fore end portions of the wires forming a normally closed or normally open sensing point, a sheath enclosure accom modating the probe elements such that the sensing points of the respective probe elements are located at different positions along the length of the sheath enclosure and holding the probe elements in parallel relation and out of contact with each other, and a number of dummy elements formed of a material similar to the probe elements and connected to the fore ends thereof in a manner to comple ment the lengths of shorter probe elements. There is also disclosed a detection circuit for monitoring wear of a refractory wall in a molten metal processing apparatus in a simple and accurate manner by the use of the probe.
