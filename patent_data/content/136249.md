# Three plate, silicon glass silicon capacitive pressure transducer.

## Abstract
A three plate silicon glass silicon capacitive pressure transducer includes a conductive silicon diaphragm and sub strate relatively spaced by a dielectric body having disposed therein a central electrode positioned between the dia phragm and substrate to form a pressure responsive capa citance with the diaphragm at a value inversely proportional to a pressure signal applied to a pressure sensing surface of the diaphragm.
