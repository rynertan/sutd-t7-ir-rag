# Apparatus comprising a manually exchangeable element.

## Abstract
In an apparatus comprising a comparatively heavy exchangeable element there is provided a clamping device for the element with a bayonet coupling and with grips which can be folded down only after the bayonet coupling has been brought into an engaged position. When the grips are folded down, a spring is activated so that a locked clamping coupling is obtained.
