# ENDOSCOPES

## Abstract
An endoscope has an insertion tube 2 constructed from a plurality of disks 15 strung together on steering cables 6 and received in a flexible plastics sheath. Each disk is formed with a plurality of service apertures defining a plurality of service passages of equal diameter within the chain of disks 15 . The cable apertures 16 in the disks 15 are skewed so that each cable 6 follows a helical path along the length of the insertion tube 2 .
