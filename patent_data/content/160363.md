# Binarizing system of picture image signals.

## Abstract
In a binarizing system in which analog picture image signals formed by scanning a manuscript with a line sensor undergo quantization and digital picture image signals obtained by the quantization are binarized into signals representing black or white according to a predetermined threshold value, levels of a digital picture image signal of a picture element to be corrected and of a digital picture image signal of a picture element at least one main scanning line before the picture element to be corrected and positioned at the same position as the picture element to be corrected in an auxiliary scanning direction which is attenuated with each main scanning line or lines are compared. Among the above two signals, a signal having a larger level at a given time is used as a reference signal showing the nature of tone of the manuscript. When the level of digital picture image signal of the picture element to be corrected is smaller than the level of the reference signal, the level of the digital picture image signal is decreased. In other cases, the level of the digital picture image signals is maintained. By this operation, the nature of tone of the manuscript is emphasized. Thus, accuracy of judgement in binarizing analog picture image signals is improved.
