## Description
This invention is generally directed to use in removing condensate from steam lines, from steam systems, and from other systems from which liquid must be removed.The apparatuses are particularly useful for the removal of liquids from systems under pressure, wherein it is desired to remove pressured liquid without excessive removal of pressured gases. In United States Patent No. 3,715,870, apparatus is disclosed for use in removing condensate from steam pipelines. A modified apparatus for the same purpose is disclosed in Patent No. 3,877,895. The apparatuses as disclosed in these patents require the use of spiral wound gasket assemblies, and the strainer required upstream of the orifice to prevent plugging of the orifice is mounted within one of the spiral wound gasket assemblies. Spiral wound gasket assemblies are relatively expensive and in many applications are somewhat cumbersome and difficult to assemble. This invention presents apparatuses of simpler form wherein the aforesaid difficulties are eliminated. The present invention provides drain orifice apparatus, comprising body means having a flow passage therethrough, plate means unitarily formed with said body means disposed to close said flow passage, an orifice through said plate means communicating between the opposite sides of said plate means for restricted fluid flow therethrough, screen means tightly fitted around its entire outer periphery around the entire interior periphery of the wall of said flow pas sage in spaced proximity to one si de of said plate means for removing detritus which would block said orifice from fluids flowing through said flow passage in a direction through said screen means toward said orifice, a screen supporting shoulder disposed around one end of said orifige between said one end of said orifice and said screen means and against which said screen means is disposed, said screen means being constructed to be passable to against said shoulder through the portion of said flow passage at said one side of said plate means in a direction longitudinal of said flow passage portion, said flow passage portion being of uniform diameter over all of its length between one end of said body means and said screen supporting shoulder and said screen means being of the same diameter. In some modifications of the apparatus, no seal at all is required, the orifice being provided in a unitary fitting which may be screw conne cted or flange connected directly into a condensate line. In other manifestations, the apparatus requires the use of conventional seals used in conventional manner. The invention also provides an improved screen for use in conJunction with condensate removal orifices which is of simplified form and is easy to install. A variety of forms of apparatuses according to the invention are presented for connection to virtually any pipeline or equipment system. Otter features and advantages of the invention will appear from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is an axial cross section of a preferred embodiment of apparatus according to the invention FIG. 2 is an end elevation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is a side elevation of another preferred embodiment of apparatus according to the Invention FIG. 4 is an axial cross section of a modified form of apparatus according to the invention FIG. 5 is an end view of the apparatus shown inFIG. 4 FIG. 6 is an axial cross section of another embodiment of apparatus according to the invention FIG. 7 is an end elevation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 6.

As noted above, the apparatuses of the invention are preferably used to remove pressured liquid such as in steam systems wherein condensate accumulates in lines and vessels and it must be removed in order that the condensate will not impede the flow of steam. The apparatu ses may be used to remove any liquid, whether the liquid be a conden sate or not, and liquids other than water may be removed therethrough. For example, in an alcohol system wherein alcohol exists as a liquid or condenses to a liquid, the alcohol may be removed through the subject devices. The apparatuses may be used in connection with any liquid materials regardless of their nature. For the removal of condensate or other liquid, the apparatus is installed at a location where the condensate or other liquid accumulates or collects, the pressure in the system forcing the liquid through the orifice provided in the apparatus. If all of the liquid in the system is not expelled, the liquid remaining prevents outflow of gas through the orifice. Therefore, the apparatuses according to the invention are best designed to have orifices of such size that most but not all of the condensate will be expelled therethrough so that at least some liquid remains within the system at the orifice to prevent loss of steam or other vapor or gas through the orifice. Steam or gas loss in any event will be small because of the small sizes of the orifices. Because of the small sizes of the orifices, which may be as small as 0.010 inch, it is necessary that the liquid be free of solids which could cause bridging or plugging of the orifice. The devices according to the invention may be used to replace conventional condensate traps, and it has been conventional in the use of condensate traps to provide a filter or strainer ahead of the trap to prevent malfunction of the trap. For this purpose, devices commonly referred to as Y strainers are most often used. These strainers may be retained when the present apparatuses are installed.The protecting strainer or screen which removes particles and detritus from the liquids flowing out through the orifice must be of a size whereby particles which would cover or plug the orifice will be removed. For example, if the outflow orifice of a drain orifice device is0.020 inch in diameter, the protecting screens must have openings no larger than 0.020 inch. For completely effective operation, it is preferred to retain the Y strainers heretofore used with condensate traps ahead of the screens which accompany the orifice devices.The Y strainers have large effective screening area while the screens accompanying the orifices have re tively small screening rea Therefore, the Y strainers disposed in a flow system ahead of the smaller screens accompanying the orifices will collect the bulk of the solids from the liquid so that the screens accompanging the orifices will not be likely to become overburdened and plugged. The conden sate traps heretofore conventionally used for removal of condensate were subJect to frequent necessity for maintenance and high maintenance costs. Mechanical failure of the traps has also been frequently encountered.By replacement of such condensate traps with drain orifice devices according to the present invention, much lower initial costs, and less maintenance and trouble will be realized.The apparatus herein presented additionally has the advantage that it cannot become stuck in the open conditionwhich would result in excessive steam losses. Referring now to the drawings in detail, and first to FIGS. 1 and 2, the drain orifice device 40 has internal threaded socket 41 and external threaded connection 42. A hexagonal formation 43 for engagement by a wrench is provided around the threaded socket 41.

A screen device 50 is disposed at the inner end of passage 45 adjacent the larger end of conical portion 46.Flow through the apparatus is in the direction of arrow 51 so that the liquid to be expelled through the apparatus passes through screen element 50 before reaching orifice 48. As heretofore explained, aY screen or similar filtering device will be provided to filter the liquid prior to its reaching the subject apparatus. In FIG. 3, there is shown a drain orifice apparatus 53 which is similar to the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 except that the orifice is provided more closely adjacent to the righthand end of the apparatus.

Ori fice 83 is formed from the apex of conical formation 277 to the center end of fitting 271 which is cylindrically recessed at 28lit. A screen element 50 is disposed in a cylindrical recess 286 formed around the end of fitting 280, at the inner end of a reduced passage 287 formed at the inner end of threaded socket 288. The exterior of fitting 274 may be hexagonal to provide for engagement by a wrench if desired. Recess 284 spaces screen element 50 from the entrance to the orifice 283. Referring now to F1C. 23 of the drawings, drain orifice device 290 includes a circular plate or disc 291 which is clamped between flanges 292, 293, or fittings 294, 295, respectively. 0 ring seals 296, 297 are provided in circular grooves around flanges 292, 293, as shown, the O ring seals engaging opposite sides of disc 291. Fitting 294 is internally threaded at 299 and fitting 295 is internally threaded at 300. Flanges 292, 293 are connected by bolts 301 and nuts 302. Disc 291 has threaded opening 304 therethrough into which is screwed an externally threaded body 305. Body 305 has a cylindrical recess 306 at its lefthand end within which a screen fitting 50 is received. The inner end of recess 306 is conical and an orifice 308 extends from the apex of the conical formation to the righthand side of body 305. Bodies 305 having different diameter orifices 308 therethrough may be interchangeably employed in this form of apparatus. In JIG. 24, there is shown a circular disc or plate 310 which may be used in place of disc or plate 291 of FIG. 23. Disc 301 has a shallow cylindrical recess 311 terminating at conical formation 312 into which screen ele ment 50 is disposed. An orifice 313 extends from the apex of conical formation 312 to the righthand side of disc 310.Discs 310 having different sizes of orifices 313 may be employed for different pressure and liquid volume flow conditions. Referring now to FIG. 25 of the drawings, there is illustrated a manner in which plural drain orifice devices may be employed where the amount of condensate to be drained varies. Pipe 320 has a drain orifice device 321 of any disclosed form installed at its righthand end. Branch pipe 322 having valve 323 has a second drain orifice device 324 of any suitable form installed at its righthand end. Under normal conditions, valve 323 will be closed and condensate flow will take place through pipe 320 and drain orifice device 321. Should excessive condensate or other liquid flow occur, then valve 323 may be opened to permit condensate or liquid drainage through drain orifice device 324. In this way, excess condensate or liquid which must be drained may be relieved without altering of the drain orifice device in use and without shutting down of any of the equipment. In FIG. 26, element 330 is a Y strainer device of modified form which includes a drain orifice device combined therein. An inlet pipe 331 is shown connected to the lefthand end of Y strainer 330. Y strainer 330 includes angular portion 332 closed by threaded plug 333. A conventional strainer unit is disposed within tube 332 in the customary manner. The righthand end of Y strainer 330 has interior threads 334 into which is screwed an externally threaded orifice plug 335 having cylindrical recess 336 terminating in conical formation 337 and in which is disposed a strainer element 50. A threaded pipe 339 is screwed into threads 334 to convey condensate or liquid drained through orifice 340.In operation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 2G, the straLner unit of Y strainer 330 first filters the condensed liquid, after which the liquid passes through secondary strainer element 50 before arriving at orifice 340. No separate drain orifice device need be provided when this modified form of Y strainer including a drain orifice device is employed. Referring now to FIG. 27 of the drawings, the strainer elements 50 hereinbefore referred to will be further described. Each strainer unit 50 includes a fine mesh screen 350 and a coarse mesh screen 351 provided to support the fine mesh screen. Screens 350 and 351 are disposed flushly one against the other. A rim 353 has flange 354 at one side and flange 355 at the other side. When the strainer elements are installed in a drain orifice apparatus, the flange 355 is open at position 355a. The strainer element is positioned in an opening 357 of a drain orifice device with flange 354 against a shoulder 358. After insertion of the screen element into the opening 357, the flange 355 in position 355a is compressed by a suitable ring shaped tool to its position 355 flushly against the fine mesh screen 350. Compression of flange 355 from position 355a to position 355 expands the rim 353 tightly against the sides of opening 357 so that tulle screen element becomes sealed in opening 357 around its periphery. This structure and manner of installation of the screen elements eliminates the necessity for separate seals around the screen elements and greatly simplifies the drain orifice structure. The orifices provided in the various forms of the apparatus may be formed in a variety of ways. The orifices may be drllled, or may be formed by an electronic disinte grating machine, or may be formed by a laser beam. DrillIng is a fairly time consuming and expensive operation. Since the drain orifice devices are preferably made of a material such as Type 304 stainless steel, which is difficult to drill, a high rate of drill bit breakage occurs even though cobalt drills or other forms of special drills are emp loyed. Where the drain orifice devices have hexagonal outer surfaces, they are conveniently manufactured using hexagonal bar stock. This procedure somewhat simplifies the manufacture of the drain orifice devices. Any material suitable for the contemplated use of the drain orifice devices may be employed. For example, in the case of fruit juices, certain types of Nonel steels may be employed. A qualified melallurgist will be capable of specifying the material to be used in any service. The invention provides drain orifice devices of simplified structure and in many cases of a reduced number of parts. The 0 ring seals employed may be formed of any suitable material known in the art. It is well known that 0 ring seals are capable of withst.mndlng very high pressure conditions. Other forms of seals, gaskets or packing may also be used, the 0 ring seals being shown by way of example because of their simple forms. While preferred embodiments of the apparatus have been described and shown in the drawings, many modifications thereof may be made by a person skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invent ion, and it is intended to protect by Letters Patent all forms of the invention falling within the scope of the following claims.
