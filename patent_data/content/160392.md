# Semiconductor memory device having double layered word lines.

## Abstract
According to a memory of the invention which can read write data, word lines 16 are connected to memory cells arranged on a semiconductor substrate 12 . Each word line 16 has a double layered structure comprising first and second conductive lines 16 1, 16 2 . An insulative layer 70 is sandwiched between the conductive lines 16 1, 16 2 . Since the insulative layer 70 has a plurality of contact holes C1 to C9 formed along the extended direction of the first and second lines and spared by an irregular pitch, the stacked lines 16 1, 16 2 are discontinuously and electrical ly connected to each other through these contact holes C1 to C9 .
