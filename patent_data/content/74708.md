## Description
ADHESIVE COMPOSITION This invention relates to adhesive compositions for adhering strongly to hard tissues in a living body, such as teeth and bones, as well as metals, organic polymers and ceramics. The term adhesive composition as herein used means not only a composition used for bonding two or more adherends to one another, but also means a composition used for forming a highly adhesive coating on the surface of an adlserend such as a mctal or organic polymer, and a composition used for forming a highly adhesive filling material for repairing hard tissues in a living body.In other words, this invention covers any and all compositions that are adhesively applicable to various kinds of substances, including hard tissues in a living body, metals, organic polymers and ceramiCs. Various kinds of metals, organic polymers and ceramics are used for the restoration of teeth. When these restorative materials are moulted in the mouth, it is necessary to ensure that they are securely bonded to teeth, or to each other. Since tfiey are placed in the mouth, it is particularly necessary that satisfactor adhesion be obtained in a wet condition. A variety of attempts have hiilerto been made to explore a practically useful adhesive for dentistry as will hereinafter be set forth.Although some adhesives have been put to practical use, they are used only for a limited scope of application, since they do not work satis factorily. An adhesive that can strongly bond a metal or organic polymer, in a wet condition, exhibiting an adliesive strength not easily affected by water, would contribute greatly to improving the art of dental restoration. An adhesive tliat provides a high adhesive strength in a wet condition will also be useful for manv other applications. C.S. Patents Nos. US A 4,259,075 and US A 4,259,117 show that a polymerizable composition a vinyl compound having a group of the formulaEMI2.1 is effective as a dental adhesive. U.S. Patent No. US A 4,222,780 shows that a polymerizable composition containing a vinyl compound having a group of the formulaEMI2.2 is also an effective dental adhesive. In fact, some of the compositions defined by these patents are widely used as primers for application to the wall of a tooth cavity before the cavity is filled. They, however, require acid etching of the cavity wall in order to provide a satisfactory adhesive strength for the tooth. Moreover, they do not provide any satisfactory adhesive strength for a Ni Cr alloy comprising 93 Ni and 6r Cr, which is used commonly in dentistry. There have also been proposed dental adhesives prepared from polymerizable phosphate compounds as will hereinafter be described. None of them has, however, been put to practical use because of their unsatisfactory adhesive strength. i U. S. Patent No. 3,882,600 describes phosphoric monofluoride. ii Journal of Dental Research, vol. 53, pages 878 to 888 and vol. 56, pages 943 to 952, Chemical Abstract, vol. 77, page 290 66175 g and Japanese Laid Open PatentSpecification No. 44152 1976 describe CH2 CH PO OH 2 andCH2 CHC6H4CH2PO OH 2. iii Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 1138A3 1978 shows by a general formula the confounds obtained by neutralizing one of the two hydroxy groups in the cor pounds of the formulaEMI3.1 in which R stands for an organic residue having at least one vinyl group. icre specifically, it shows the following compounds.In the following formulas, X stands for an alkali metal CH3CH2 CHC6H4OPO OH OMO , CH2 C COOCH2CH2OPO OH OM CH2 CHCH2OPO OH OM ,EMI3.2 EMI3.3 EMI4.1 None of the compounds set forth at i to iii above provides a satisfactorily high adhesive strength in a wet condition. There have also been made a number of other proposals to provide adhesives which are useful for both teeth and metals, as will hereinafter be summarized. i U. S. Latent No. 4,148,988 shows 4 methacryloxy ethyl trimellitate as an adhesive monomer. This monomer, however, cannot maintain a strong bond between a tooth and a metal or organic polymer for a long time in the mouth in which a wet condition and repeated occlusal pressure prevail. U. S. Patent No. 3,872,047 and Japanese Laid OpenPatent Specification No. 98878 1974 disclose a polymer having both a hydrophilic group and a hydrophobic group as an adhesive constituent. They show methacryloxyethyl phosphate as a moncmer constituting the polymer. This polymer does, however, not appear to provide any satisfactory adhesive strength. iii It is kncwn that a polymer obtained by polymeriz ing a vinyl monomer on the tooth surface employing a ternary curing agent composed of a peroxide, an amine and a sulfinate has an improved adhesive strength on the tooth U. S.Patent No. 4,182,035 . No satis actory adhesive strength can, however, be obtained from any combination employing a known vinyl monomer, but it is believed necessary to explore a new adhesive vinyl monomer. It is known that if a polymerizable composition containing 2 meth acryloxyethyl dihyroen phosphate is cured on an iron or stainless steel surface, the cured product adheres to the metal surface, as described in the various references which will hereinafter be cited No attempt has, however, been hitherto made to obtain phosphate esters having a higher adhesive strength than 2 meth acryloyl oxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate, particularly in a wet con tion. A. U. S. Patent No. 3,754,972 discloses the formation of an adhesive coating on a metal surface by applying a polymerizable composition containing a phosphate ester thereto.While it shows the applicable phosphate esters by way of a general formula, the examples set forth therein provide a specific support for the adhesive property of only the compounds of the following formula obtained by reacting hydroxy ethyl acrylate withEMI5.1 in which m is 1 or 2, n is 1 or 2, and m n 3.B. U. S. Patent No. 3,884,864 discloses the manufacture of a phosphorus cured material which is useful as a fire retardant material, and save that it shows a high adhesive strength on a metal. It is, however, manufactured from phosphate esters obtained by reacting hydroxyethyl methacrylate or ss hydroxychloropropyl methacrylate with P2O5.They are the phosphate esters represented by the general formula I which will hereinafter appear, and in which R2 has a maximum of three carbon atoms.C. U. S. Patent No. 3,987,127 discloses a radiation polymerizable coating composition containing a polymerizable phosphate ester. It shows a general formula for the applicable phosphate esters which includes those represented by the formula I when R2 stands for an alkylene group having a maximum of six carbon atoms. The compounds listed specifically therein, and employed in the examples are, however, only those obtained when R2 is a group of the formula CH2CH2 It does not aive any example of the compounds containing an alkylene group having three or more carbon atoms, D. U S.Patent No. 4,001,150 discloses a composition containing G polymerizable phosphate ester, and used for preparing an electroconductive resin. The applicable phosphate esters shown by way of example therein are those repre sented by the formula I when R2 is an alkylene group having a maximum of four carbon atoms. The patent says that it is not advisable to use any compound containing an alkylene group having more than four carbon atoms.E. U. S. patent No. 4,044,044 discloses an anaerorc adhesive composition containing a polymerizable phosphate ester of the general formula EMI6.1 in which Ra stands for H, CH3 or C2H5, Rb stands forEMI7.1 orEMI7.2 ano n is an integer of 1 to 10.It bones, however, not show any phosphate ester specifi cal ly except 2 methacryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate.F. Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 2 0238 1974 discloses an anaerobic adhesive containing 2 compound of the general formulaEMI7.3 in which R stands for H or CH3, and Z stands for a halogen It does not show any attempt to use a phosphate ester hav ing 2 larger number of carbon atoms. Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 100596 1975 describes the usefulness of an organic compound having a P OH group as one of the constituents of an electroconcuc tive composition, and spe ifically shows by way of example a compound which corresponds to that of the formula I whenR2 stands for CH2CH2 or CH2CH2 OCH2CH2 . iT HOWEVER fails to show any other compound having a larger number of carbon atoms. Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 125182 1976 discloses a curable resin composition suitable for use in coating a metal surface, but which contains only a compound corresponding to that represented bv the formula 5 when R2 stands for CH2CH2 orEMI7.4 Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 12995 1978 discloses a low temperature curable resin compo tion containing a phosphate ester which corresponds to that represented by the formula I when R2 stands forEMI8.1 Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 11920 1981 discloses a polymerizable composition containing an epoxy diacrylate and a phosphate ester as a diluent therefor, and having a high adhesive strength on a meal.Al though it shows a general formula for the compounds corresponding to those represented by the formula I when R2 stands or CH2CH2 2 , in whicn i is from 1 to 10, it specifically snows only a compound obtained when A is 1, and 2 methacryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate is the only phosphate ester employed in the Examples set forth in the specification. It will be noted from the foregoing that, though there are a lot of prior patents and patent applications disclosing compositions containing polymerizable phosphate esters as hereinabove mentioned at A to F, it is only the compositions containing 2 meth acryloyloxyethyl dihydrogen phosphate corresponding to the compounds represented 5 the formula I when R2 stands or a group having two carbon atoms that have specifically been found effective as an adhesive, and that all the other similar compounds shown by ay of example therein correspond merely to those represented by the formula I when R2 stands for a group having two to four carbon atoms. Although these patents and patent applications state that the compositions containing those cor tounos exhibit a high adhesive strength on metals, none of them speaks of the adhesiveness of the compositions in a wet condition, nor do they contemplate in the use of these compositions for dental applications. The present invention provides an adhesive composition comprising 100 parts by weight of a polymerizable monomer comprising a 1.5 to 50 parts by weight of a compound represented by one of formulae I and II EMI9.1 where each of R1 and R1 is hydrogen or methyl, R2 is a bivalent organic residue having from 5 to 40 carbon atoms, each of X1 andX2 is O , S or NH , a is 0 or 1, and R3 is a group of the formulaEMI9.2 having 6 to 40 carbon atoms, where each of and R4 is a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 29 carbon atoms optionally having as substituent s halogen, hydroxy, amino or carboxy, b is 0, 1, 2 or 3, the R, s, if more than one are present, being the same or different, and at least one or R4 and R42 having at least three carbon atoms, and Z is o , COO or XE , and b 50 98.5 parts by weight of a vinyl monomer copolymerizable with the said compound and 0.01 to 20 parts by weight of a curing agent. As will appear from the experimental data below, compositions can be made in accordance with the present invention that adhere strongly to any of the hard tissues in a living body, such as teeth and bones, and to metals, organic polymers and ceramics, and that exhibits an excellent adhesive strength even in the presence of water.Such adhesive compositions can be used for bonding, witfi a high adhesive strength, a hard tissue in a living body to another tissue or to a material for tlie restoration of the tissue, such as a metal, organic polymer or ceramics, or for filling a hard tissue in a living body to restore it.In dentistry, they can be applied to the surface of a cavity in a tooth to form a strong bond between the tooth and the material with which the cavity is filled, as dental filling composition, for securing a restorative material, such as an inlay, onlay, crown, bridgework or orthodontic appliance, to a tooth tissue or abutment tooth, in every case having a high adhesion to the tooth They can also be used industrially or in the home to bond one metal to another, a metal to an organic polymer or ceramics, one ceramic to another, or ceramics to an organic polymer, or as a coating agent or paint to form a highly adhesive film on a metal or ceramic surface. Although the compositions of this invention contain a compound of the formula I or II as an adhesive monomer, a compound of formula I containing an organic residue R2 having only four carbon atoms may also be used when the compositions are for dental use. The term organic residue as herein used means i a hydrocarbon group optionally having an OH, COOR or NE2 group or a halogen atom C1, Br, F or I as a substituent or ii a residue consisting of 2 to 20 hydrocarbon groups of the ty pe defined above at i bonded to one another by ether, thioether, ester, thioester, thiocarbonyl, amide, carbonyl, sulfonyl or urethane linkages.

Their adhesive strength begins to drop if the number of the carbon atoms in R2 exceeds 30 In order to attain the objective of this invention, therefore, it is necessary to ensure that R2 have not more than 40 carbon atoms. The compounds of the formulas I and II can Ten erally be synthesized in accordance with the processes for the synthesis of phosphorus compounds as described in Organophosphorus Compounds G.M. Kosolapoff, Wiley, 1950 , Organophosphorus Monomers and Polymers Ye. L.Gefter, Rregamon Press, 1962 , Modern Organic SynthesisSeries 5, Organophosphorus Compounds The Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan Gihodo, 1971 and Beilstein Springer Verlag . For example, the compounds of the forEMI35.1 formEMI35.2 reacting it with at least an eauimolar amount of phosphorus oxychloride in the presence of a tertiary amine to form a compound of the formulaEMI35.3 and hydrolyzing the P C1 bonds therein.The compounds of the formulaEMI35.4 can be obtained by synthesizing H Xl R2 PO3 2Na or H X1 R2 PO OR 2, in which R stands for a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and reacting it withEMI35.5 under the Shotten Baumanns reaction conditions.If R2 stands forEMI35.6 the phosphate ester for use in the preparation of the adhesive composition according to this invention may be obtained as will hereunder be described. Equimolar amounts ofEMI36.1 andEMI36.2 in which R6 stands for R6 Y dR6 , are reacted with each other in the presence of triethylbenzylammonium chloride to formEMI36.3 Similarly,EMI36.4 and HOOC R6 are reacted with each other to formEMI36.5 These hydroxy compounds are reacted with at least an equimolar remount of phosphorus oxychloride in the presence of a terEMI36.6 P C1 bonds therein. The adhesive composition of this invention also contains a vinyl monomer which is copolymerizable with the compound of the formula I or II. The viscosity, wettability, curability and mechanical properties of the adhesive depend on the copolymerizable vinyl monomer to be employed. While various types of vinyl monomers can be used in accordance with the requirements for the adhesive to be prepared, it is usually advisable to employ a meth acrylate type monomer, a styrene type monomer or vinyl acetate.It is, however, possible to employ other compounds, for example, acrylamides such as meth acrylamide, N n butoxymethyl meth acrylamide and N hydroxymethyl acrylamide, meth acrylic acid, isobutylvinyl ether, diethyl fumarate, methyl maleate, methyl vinyl ketone, allyl chloride, vinylnaphthalene and vinylpyridine. Suitable examples of the styrene type monomers include compounds of the formulaEMI37.1 in which Q stands for a halogen atom or a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or more specifically, divinylbenzene and p chlorostyrene. The meth acryiate type monomers often employed in the preparation of conventional anaerobic or dental adhesives can advantageously be used for preparing the adhesive composition of this invention. These monomers are repre sented bv the formulaEMI37.2 in which R1 stands forH or CH3, U stands for an organic residue as hereinabove defined having 1 to 50 carbon atoms, and t is an integer of 1 to 4.Specific examples of these monomers are as follows 1 Monofunctional meth acrylates Methyl meth acrylate, ehtyl meth acrylate, n butyl meth acrylate, isobutyl meth acrylate, n hexyl meth acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl meth acrylate, benzyl meth acrylate, decyl meth acrylate, lauryl meth acrylate, stearyl meth acrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate HEMA , 2 hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylate, diethyl aminoethyl meth acrylate, 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and 2,3 dibromopropyl meth acrylate 2 Bifunctional meth acrylates a Compounds of the above formula in which Q stands forEMI38.1 in which s is an integer of 0 to 15 Ethylene glycol di meth acrylate, diethylene glycol di meth acrylate, triethylene glycol di meth acrylate, tetraethylene glycol di meth acrylate, polyethylene glycol di meth acrylate, propylene glycol di meth acrylate, dipropylene glycol di meth acrylate, and tripropylene glycol di meth acrylate b Compounds of the above formula in which Q stands for an alkylene normally having 3 to 12 carbon atoms Propanediol di meth acrylate, glycerol di meth acrylate, 1,3 butanediol di meth acrylate, 1,4 butanediol di meth acrylate, 1,5 pentanediol di meth acrylate, 1,6hexanediol di meth acrylate, neopentyl glycol di meth acrylate, 1, 10 decanediol di meth acrylte, and 2, 3 dibromoneopene glycol dimethacrylate c Compounds of the above formula in which Q contains a bisphenol A derivative residue Bisphenol A di meth acrylate, 2,2 bis meth acryloyl oxypolyethoxyphenyl propaneEMI38.2 in which t is an integer of 1 to 9 3, 2,2 bis 4 cryloyloxypropoxy phenyl propane and 2,2 bis 4 3 methacryloyloxy 2 hydroxy propoxy phenyl propane Bis GMA , among which the compounds in which Q has 15 to 30 carbon atoms are particularly preferred d Compounds of the above formula in which Q stands forEMI39.1 in which u is 1 or 2 1,2 Bis 3 meth acryloyloxy 2 hydroxypropoxy ethyne, and 1,4 bis 3 meth acryloyloxy 2 hydroxypropoxy butane, e Urethane di meth acrylates of the above formula in which 0 stands for JOCONHTNHCOOJ, in which J stands for an alkylene group normally having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, and T stands for an organic diisocyanate residue having 1 to 50 carbon atoms, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No. 687 1975 3 Tri functional and tetrafunctional methacrylates Trimethylolpropane tri meth acrylate, trimethylol ethane tri meth acrylate, tetramethylolmethane tri meth acrylate, tetramethylolmethane tetra meth acrylate, andN,N 2,2,4 trimethylhexamethylene bis 2 aminocarboxy propane 1,3 diol tetramethacrylate. One or more of these copolymerizable monomers are employed. For preparing a dental adhesive composition, it is advisable to use a methacrylate or methacrylates in the quantity of at least 50 by weight of all the copolymerizable monomers employed. Preferred examples of the methacrylates include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, HEMA, nhexyl methacrylate, benzyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate,Bis GMA, bisphenol A dimethacrylate, 2,2 bis meth acryloyl oxypolyethoxyphenyli propane, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol dimethacrylate, 1,10 decanediol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, and trimethylolethane trimethacrylate. For preparing the adhesive composition of this invention, it is necessary to employ the compound of the formulaI or II in the quantity of 0.5 to 50 , or preferably 1.5 to 40 , by weight of all the polymerizable monomers employed.If it is less than 0 5 by weight, no satisfactorily high adhesive strength is obtained, while the use of more than 506 by weight is likely to result in an adhesive bond of lower water resistance The water resistance of an adhesive bond is also affected by the type of the copolymerizable monomer employed If a water soluble monomer having a hydrophilic functional group, such as meth acrylic acid, 2hydroxyethyl meth acrylate or methacrylamide, is employed, therefore, it is highly advisable to ensure that it not occupy more than 50 by weight of all the polymerizable monomers employed. The adhesive composition of this invention is applied to adherend surfaces, and cured either physically by heating or irradiation with I rays or ultraviolet or visible light,or chemically by a polymerization initiator. It is usually advisable to polymerize by irradiating light in tbe presence of a photo sensitizer, or using a polymerization initiator. The term touring agent as herein used covers both of the polymerization initiator and the photosensitizer together. It is possible to use various curing agents, for example, organic peroxides, azo compounds, organic metal compounds, redox type initiators, and photosensitizers for ultraviolet or visible rays.More specifically, it is possible to use, for example, benzoyl peroxide, di t butyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, tributylborane, organic sulfinic acids or the salts thereof, hydrogen peroxide Fe2 salts, cumene hydroperoxide Fe2 slats, benzoyl peroxide N,N dialkylaniline derivatives, ascorbic acid Cu2 salts, organic sulfinic acid or the salt thereof amine or the salt thereof peroxide, diketone a num lylthiourea for visible rays , benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzyl, diacetyl or diphenyl disulfide, and di naphthyl sulfide For a dental adhesive composition, it is particularly preferable to use benzoyl peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile, tributylborane, organic sulfinic acids or the salts thereof, or aromatic sulfinic acid or the salt thereof diacyl peroxide aromatic secondary or tertiary amine or the salt thereof .Suitable examples of the aromatic sulfinic acids include benzenesulfinic acid, p toluenesulfinic acid, W naphthalene sulfinic acid and styrenesulfinic acid. While alkali metal, alkali earth metal or ammonium ions may, for example, be used as. the cation to form a salt with a sulfinic acid, it is preferable to use alkali or alkali earth metal ions in order to produce a high degree of storage stability and adhesive strenght. Examples of such ions are Li , Na , K , Mg2 Ca2 and Sr2 . Preferred examples of the aromatic amines include N,N dimethylaniline, N,N dimethyl p toluidine, N,Ndiethanolaniline, N,N diethanol p toluidine, N methylaniline, and N methyl p toluidine. It, is also possible to use a salt of any such amine with an acid, e.g. hydrochloric, acetic or phosphoric acid.Preferred examples of the diacyl peroxides include benzoyl peroxide, m toluoyl per oxide, 2, 4 dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, octanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide and succinic acid peroxide. It is particularly preferable to use benzoyl peroxide or m toluoyl peroxide The curing agent may be used in the quantity of 0.01 to 20, or preferably 0.1 to 15, parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer em plowed. It is sometimes preferable for the adhesive composition of this invention to contain a volatile organic solvent having a boiling point higher than 1500C at 76 Torr 101 iPa The addition of any such solvent is particularly useful for an adhesive composition used as a primer for the tooth cavity to be filled with a dental filling material. After the composition has been applied, air or nitrogen is blown thereagainst to volatilize the solvent to form a vinyl compound film on the adherend surface. Examples of the suitable solvents include methanol, ethanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether and toluene.The quantity of the solvent should not exceed 300, or preferably 100, times as much by weight as that of all the polymerizable monomers employed. The use of the solvent in any larger quantity can result, upon volatilization, in the formation of too thin a film of the polymerizable monomer on the adherend surface, or a great reduction in its adhesive strength. The adhesive composition of this invention may further contain a conventionally known filler of the inorganic, organic or composite type to form a dental cement for luting or filling, a dental composite resin or a bone cement. The adhesive composition may contain up to 1,000 parts, or preferably 20 to 500 parts, by weight of the filler for 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomers. The filler improves the rheological properties of the composition, and the mechanical properties, adhesive strength and water resistance of the cured composition.Examples of the applicable inorganic fillers include natural minerals such as quartz, feldspar, pottery stone, wollasto nite, mica, clay, kaolin and marble, ceramics such as silica, alumina, silicon nitride, boron carbide, boron nitride, and glass ceramics containing lanthanum, glass such as soda glass, barium glass, strontium glass or borosilicate glass, and water insoluble inorganic salts such as barium sulfate and calcium carbonate.The inorganic filler is usually treated with a silane coupling agent such as r methacryloyl oxypropyltrimethoxysi lane, vinyltrimethoxys il ane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrichlorosilane, vinyltris 2 methoxyethoxy silane, vinyltriacetoxysilane or Y mercaptopropyltrimethoxy silane. If an organic filler is preferred, it is possible to use any of various types of polymers, for example, polymethyl methacrylate, polyamide, polyester, polypeptide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, polystyrene, chloroprene rubber, nitrile rubber, styrene butadiene rubber or polyvinyl acetate It is also possible to use a composite filler comprising a silanated inorganic filler coated with a polymer. One or more substances may be used as the filler.The filler may usually have a particle size of 1DO microns or less, and its particles may be formless, spherical, lamellar or fibrous. If a polymer is used, it may be dissolved in the polymerizable monomer and the volatile organic solvent. The adhesive composition of this invention preferably contains an inorganic or composite filler to form a dental cement or composite resin, and an organic filler to form a bone cement In addition to the various constituents as hereinabove described, the adhesive composition of this invention may contain a polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone monomethyl ether MEHQ or an antioxidant such as 2,di tert butyl p cresol 1 an ultraviolet absorbing agent, a pigment or dye, phthalic acid diester or silicone oil if required to satisfy the various practical requirements for performance These additives are employed in a small quan tity up to a maximum of 10 parts, and usually up to five parts, by weight for 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomers. A room temperature curing redox type initiator may often be used when the adhesive composition of this invention is used for dental, orthopedic or other medical purposes. In such a case, it is necessary to ensure the storage stability of the composition, and therefore, to choose a proper package form which keeps the oxidant and the reducing agent away from each other It is, for example, possible to employ separate packages for Ca the vinyl compound and the oxidant and b the vinyl compound and the reducing agent, a the vinyl compound and the oxidant or reducing agent and b the volatile organic solvent and the reducing agent or oxidant , a the vinyl compound and the oxidant or reducing agent and b the filler and the reducing agent or oxidant , or a the vinyl compound, the filler and the oxidant and b the vinyl compound, the filler and the reducing agent.In an organic sulfinic acid or salt thereof amine or salt thereof peroxide system, which is a particularly suitable redox polymerization initiator for the adhesive composition of this invention, the ssulfinlc acid and the amine serve as a reducing agent, and the peroxide as an oxidant. In this case, it is possible to employ three separate packages by packing the sulfinic acid and the amine separately.When a photosensitizer is employed, it is necessary to keep the vinyl compound and the photosensitizer in z container shielded against light. If tributylborane or any other polymerization initiator initiating polymerization within a short time after contacting the vinyl compound is employed, it is necessary to pack the vinyl compound and the initiator separately from each other. The various constituents of the adhesive composition stored in separate packages as hereinabove described may be mixed together immediately prior to application. The adhesive composition of this invention adheres excellently to any of the following materials, and maintains a high adhesive strength for a long time even in a wet condition 1 Hard tissues in a living body, such as teeth and bones 2 Metals, including not only base metals such as iron, nickel, chromium, cobalt, aluminum, copper, zinc and tin, or stainless steel, brass or other alloys thereof, but also noble metal alloys containing 50 to 90g of gold or platinum, which it has hitherto been difficult to bond by any known adhesive 3 ceramics, such as glass, porcelain, silica and alumina and 4 organic polymers, such as polymethyl methacryl ate, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, poly carbonate, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene. The adhesive composition of this invention can be used for various fields of application because of its high adhesive strength on various kinds of materials. The preferred examples of its applications will hereunder be set forth 1 Dental Applications The composition can be used as a composite resin adhering to a tooth, as an adhesive for application to the cavity surface prior to the placement of the composite resin in the cavity, as an adhesive for bonding an inlay, onlay, crown or the like to a cavity or abutment tooth, as an adhesive for orthodonties, as an adhesive for holding a bridgework, post or the like, or as a pit and fissure sealant. The composite resin usually comprises a polymerizable monomer, a filler and a curing agent.The composite resin and the adhesive used for the placement thereof are usually supplied together in a combination to the dentist. The specific constituents of a particular adhesive composition are selected to suit its application as hereinbefore described.If the composition is used, for example, as the adhesive to be coated on the tooth prior to the placement of the composite resin, it may contain 2 t9 40 by weight of the adhesive vinyl compound diluted with any other polymerizable monomer1 such as Bis GMA, HEMA or an aliphatic dimethacrylate, or an organic solvent such as ethanol, and further contain a room temperature curing agent. in accordance with the recipe shown in U. S. PatentNo. 4,259,075 vr 4,259,117.The adhesive composition which is used as a dental composite resin may comprise a customary filling material consisting of 20 to 40 by weight of Bis GMA or other polymerizable monomer and 60 to 80 by weight of filler, and .2 to 40 by weight of an adhesive vinyl compound based on the total weight of the polymerizable monomer in accordance with the recipe shown in the U. S. patents hereinabove cited. The composition may be applied to a tooth by a customary method.As opposed to the compositions disclosed in U. S. PatentsNos. 4,259,075 and 4,259,117, however, the composition of this invention does not call for the acid etching of the tooth surface to provide a satisfactory adhesive strength, The acid etching of the tooth should be avoided as far as possible, since it is likely to have an injurious effect on the dentin. When the composite resin is cured, it strongly adheres to the tooth, and does not require any mechanical retention such as an undercut.The adhesive composition used for bonding an inlay, onlay, crown, or the like to a tooth cavity or abutment tooth may, for example, comprise 60. to 98 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate, 2 to 40 parts by weight of adhesive vinyl monomer, and 50 to 150 parts by weight of polymethyl methacrylate. A slight excess of the adhesive may be applied to the adherend surface, and an inlay or the like brought into intimate contact therewith, whereby it is possible to effect the bonding of any such dental restorative appliance to the tooth which no conventional luting cement has hitherto been able to achieve 2 Orthopedic Applications The adhesive composition of this invention can be used as a bone cement 3 Industrial and Domestic Applications in General The adhesive composition of this invention is useful as an adhesive fo r transportation machinery, electrical apparatus, building materials, cans or ceramics, or for home use, since it provides s superior adhesive strength on metals, ceramics and organic polymers. It is also useful as a paint, a primer for a paint or a coating composition. It adheres surprisingly well to an adherend surface carrying oil, or even water Its adhesive strength is markedly higher than that of any conventional polymerization curing type adhesive, such as cyanoacrylate, epoxy resin or second generation acrylic adhesives. The invention will now be described more specifically with reference to a variety of examples which are merely illustrative. They consist of the following 1 EXAMPLES 1 to 20 Examples of the preparation of the phosphate esters represented by formula 3, and examples of the adhesive compositions containing those compounds 2 EXAMPLES 21 to 26 Examples of the preparation of the phosphate esters represented by formula 4, and examples of the adhesive compositions containing those compounds 3 EXAMPLES 27 to 36 Examples of the preparation of the phosphate esters represented by formula 5, and examples of the adhesive compositions containing those compounds 4 EXAMPLES 37 to 46 Examples of the preparation of the phosphate esters represented by formula 6, and examples of the adhesive compositions containing those compounds 5 EXAMPLES 47 to 53 Examples of the adhesive composition of this invention used for dental application and 6 EXAMPLES 54 to 61 Adhesive strength of the adhesive composition of this invention on metals, ceramics and organic polymers.

EXAMPLE 37 A one liter three neck flask was charged with 250 g 2.9 mols of methacrylic acid, 480 g 2.4 mols of 1,3 bis 2 hydroxyethoxy benzene, 35 g of p toluenesulfonic acid, and 0 6 g of MEHQ They were heated to 850C until they were dissolved to form a uniform solution. The flask pressure was reduced to a level of 20 t6 100 mm Hg 2.7 to 13 kPa by an aspirator. While oxygen was blown into the flask, the solution was heated two a temperature of 85 C to 900C, and water was removed by distillation. When water ceased to appear after about four hours, the reaction was discon tinued.While the reactant solution was still hot, it was poured into 1.5 liters of toluene, and the precipitated unreacted diol was removed by a 4 filter. The filtrate was washed twice with a 5 aqueous solution of Na2CO3, and three times with neutral water, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. After 0.1 g of MEHQ had been added, toluene was removed by vacuum distillation at a temperature not ex ceeding 800C. There was obtained a monoester and diester mixture weighing 460 g. The analysis of the mixture by HLC indicated a monoester content of 64 by weight, and only a trace of unreacted diol. A solution containing 55.2 g 0.36 mol of phosphorus oxychloride in 150 cc of tetrahydrofuran was placed in a one liter reactor, and cooled to 50 C. A solution contain ing 125 g of the monoester and diester mixture, which contained 0.3 mol of monoester, and 33.4 g 0.33 mol of triethylamine in 150 cc of tetrahydrofuran was placed in a 500 cc dropping funnel, and the funnel was connected to the reactor. The monoester solution was dropped slowly, while dry N2 gas was being blown into the reactor to stir the phosphorus oxychloride solution strongly.The internal temperature of the reactor was kept at a level of 45DC to 50tC while the dropping operation was continurd, and at 450C for an hour after its termination. he temperature was, then, raised to OOC, dnd a solution contwining 30 ml of water and 75.9 g of triethylamine in 100 cc of tetrahydrofuran was dropped slowly. The reactant solution was cooled with ice, and stirred continuously for 15 hours thereafter, whereby the P C1 bonds were hydrolyzed. The precipitated triethylammonium chloride was removed by a w4 glass filter. After 30 mg of MEHQ had been added into the filtrate, tetrahydrofuran was removed by vacuum distillation at a temperature not exceeding 30 C. A solution of the residue in 800 cc of ethyl acetate was put in a separatory funnel, and washed three times with 300 cc of a 2 N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and twice with 30n cc of neutral water. After the residue bad been dehydrated overnight with anhydrous sodium sulfate, 30 mg of MEHQ were added1 and ethyl acetate was removed by vacuum distillation to yield a liquid residue. It was washed with toluene repeatedly, and any volatile matter in the residue was removed by vacuum distillation.There was obtained a solid crude phosphate monoester weighing 67 g. The monoester was dis solved in 150 cc of acetone, and after the insoluble matter had been removed by filtration, the phosphate monoester in the solution was recrystallized by adding a mixed solvent containing toluene and n hexane in a ratio by volume of 1 1 to yield 58 g of crystals. The crystals had smelting point of 640C to 67 C.The NMR at 90 MHz of a d6 acetone solution of the crystals was examined at ordinary room temperature. There were found an ethylenic proton signal at 5 6.05 and 5.55, multifold signals of eight methylenic protons at 4.0 to 4.54 a methyl proton signal at A 1.85, four proton sig nazis of phenylene.at 6.3 to 6.5 and 7.0 to 7.2, and a phosphoric proton signal at 9.2.The elemental analysis of the compound indicated 49.08 C theoretically 48.68 and 8 6 P 8.9 , and showed that it was a compound of theEMI80.1 EXAMPLE 38 A diol monoester and diester mixture was prepared by repeating the procedures of EXAMPLE 37, except for the use of 216 g 3.0 mols of acrylic acid instead of methacrylic acid After the monoester content of the mixture had been examined by HLC, that quantity of the mixture which contained 0.3 mol of monoester was subjected to phosphate esterification. The procedures of EXAMPLE 37 were followed for separating the reaction product to yield a solid compound weighing 60 g.The NMR of the compound, and its elemental analysis C 47.5 theoretically 47.0 and P 8.9 9.3 indicated that it was a compound of the formula EMI81.1 It showed a purity of at least 95 upon analysis by HLC. EXAMPLES 39 TO 42 The procedures of EXAMPLES 37 and 38 were followed for synthesizing four compounds as shown in TABLE 9 by employing methacrylic or acrylic acid, and 1,3 bis 3 hydroxypropoxy benzene or 1,3 bis 4 hydroxybutoxy benzene as diol. The structure of each compound was determined by NMR and elemental analysis, and its purity by RLC.

Package II was b uniform mixture of the benzene sulfinate and amine powders in the PNMA powder. A 10 mm square by 3 mm thick plate of a Ni Cr alloy containing 92.7 of nickel was polished with 1000 abrasive paper, and washed ultrasonically in water and methyl ethyl ketone. An adhesive cellophane tape having a hole with a diameter of 5 mm was bonded to the plate so that the hole might be aligned with the center of the polished plate surface. An equal number of stainless steel bars having a diameter of 7 mm and a length of 35 mm were prepared, and one end surface of each bar was polished and washed as the alloy plates had been. A mixture containing equal weights of the components in Packages I and II was applied by a brush to the alloy plate exposed through the hole in the cello phane tape, and the stainless steel bar, and the plate and the bar were joined to each other by forming a butt joint.Twenty samples, or bonded bar and plate combinations were prepared by employing each adhesive composition, and immersed in water at 370C after an hour. Ten samples were removed from water after 24 hours, and the remaining 10 samples after 10 days. They were examined for adhesive strength by an Instron tensile tester.

The cavities were treated with a 40 aqueous solution of phosphoric acid for a minute, washed with water, and dried fully by an air syringe. Two liquids forming the adhesive composition of EXAMPLE 49 1 were dropped into a Dappen dish, and mixed together.The resultant mixture was coated on the inner surfaces of the cavities, and air was blown thereagainst by an air syringe for several seconds to volatilize ethanol. The components of the twopack composite resin were mixed, and the resultant mixture was filled in the cavities under pressure. The molar was immersed in water at 370C overnight, and on the following day, the excess of the composite resin was removed to expose the margins of the cavities. The remaining portion of the tooth was sealed with an acrylic resin.The test samples were immersed alternately in two aqueous solutions of fuchsine having a temperature of 40C and 60 C, respectively, 100 times for a minute each time for examination as to the penetration of the dye into the cavity margins percolation test . After the percolation tests had been finished, the tooth was split, and did not indicate any penetration of fuchsine into the margins. EXAMPLE 51 A powder liquid type adhesive composition was prepared by employing adhesive monomer No. 3 of EXAMPLE 47, and tested for adhesive strength on the dentin of human teeth, the enamel of bovine teeth, and a Ni Cr alloy Nowchrom I product of TOWS GIKEN K.K., Japan 1 Components of the Adhesive Composition Package V Liquid Bis GMA 40 parts by weight 1,10 Decanediol dimethacrylate 3Q HEMA 20 Adhesive monomer No. 3 of 10 EXAMPLE 47 Benzoyl peroxide 1 part Hydroguinone monomethyl ether 0.05 Package VI Powder Silanated quartz powder 100 parts by weight Sodium benzenesulfinate 0.6 part N,N Diethanol p toluidine 0.6 The powder VI was prepared by spraying a solution of sodium benzenesulfinateand N,N diethanol p toluidine in 10 parts by weight of methanol uni formly on quartz powder, and volatilizing methanol. 2 Adhesion on Human Dentin The crown of a human molar was cut off to expose the dentin, while water was being poured on the tooth. The dentin surface was etched with a 40 aqueous solution of orthophosphoric acid for a minute, and after it had been washed with water, the water on the dentin surface was blown away by an air syringe. A double coated adhesive tape was bonded to the dentin surface. The tape had a hole with a diameter of 5 mm. The tooth was supported so that it might have a horizontal cross section. Aplastics ring having an inside diameter of 6 mm and a thickness of 5 mm was placed on the tape so that the ring might be aligned with the center of the hole in the tape. The liquid V dnd the powder VI were mixed in a ratio by weight of 1 2, and kneaded for about one minute to form a paste.This paste was filled in the ring, and a hook for a tensile test was anchored in the paste and left at rest for 30 minutes.This test sample was immersed in water at 370C. Five teeth were employed for testing each adhesive composition. 3 Adhesion on Bovine Tooth Enamel The labial surface of a bovine incisor was ground in a stream of water to provide a smooth surface. The procedures described at 2 above were followed for the acid etching of the labial surface, and the preparation of a test sample. 4 Adhesion on Ni Cr Alloy A 10 mm square by 3 mm thick plate and a round bar having a diameter of 7 mm and a length of 20 mm were cast from a Ni Cr alloy Nowchrom I containing 928 Ni product of TOWA GIKEN K.K., Japan . The plate and the bar were polished with 1000 abrasive paper, washed ultrasonically with water, and dried by an air syringe. An adhesive backed tape Transpore trademark having a hole with R diameter of 5 mm was bonded to the alloy plate. The liquid V and the powder VI were mixed in a ratio by weight of 1 2, and kneaded for about one minute to form a paste. A thick layer of the paste was applied onto one end of the bar, and pressed against the plate to bond the bar to the plate. The test sample thus prepared was left at rest for 30 minutes, and immersed in water at 370C. Six samples were prepared by employing each adhesive composition. 5 Adhesive Strength Test After one week of immersion in water at 370C, each sample was examined for adhesive strength by anInstron tensile tester at a crosshead speed of 2 mm min.TABLE 16 shows the average of the results obtained on the several samples in each case.

An inlay fitting the cavity was cast from a 14 carat gold alloy, and its adherend surface was sandblasted. with alumina particles having a particle size of 30 microns.The cavity was not etched with an acid, but was only washed with water, and dried fully by an air syringe. The liquid and the powder for the powder liquid type adhesive composition resin cement employed in EXAMPLE 51 were mixed in a ratio of 0.1 to 0.4 g, and kneaded for a minute to form a soft paste. This paste was coated on the cavity surface, and the inlay was immediately fitted in the cavity. The bonded molar and inlay assembly was immersed in water at 370C after 10 minutes, and subjected to a percola tion test after 24 hours in accordance with the method employed in EXAMPLE 50. The test results indicated that the penetration of fuchsine had stopped in the enamel in the cavity, and that there was no penetration of fuchsine in the dentin. EXAMPLE 53 A visible light curing dental composite resin was prepared from 15 parts by weight of Bis GER, 4 parts by weight of 1,2 bis 3 methacryloyloxy 2 hydroxypropoxy ethane, 4 parts by weight of neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, 3 parts by weight of 10 methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1 part by weight of camphorquinone, 0.3 part by weight of allylthiourea, 73 parts by weight of silanated quartz powder, and 1.5 parts by weight of colloidal silica. A cavity having a diameter of 3 mm and a depth of 2 mm was formed in the labial surface of an extracted human incisor by a diamond point. The cavity was etched, washed with water, and dried in accordance with the procedures ofEXAMPLE 50. The cavity was filled with the composite resin, and the resin was exposed for three minutes to the light of a 500 W tungsten halogen lamp. The tooth was, then, immersed in water at 37 C. After it had been removed from water, it was cut, and the adhesion of the resin to the cavity wall was examined through a microsccpe. This examination indicated complete adhesion of the resin to the cavity wall, and did not reveal any clearance therebetween.
