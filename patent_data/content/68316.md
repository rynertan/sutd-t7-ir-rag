# Filter distribution nozzle.

## Abstract
A filter distribution nozzle 1 having a chamber portion defined at least in part, by a perforated wall 2 and a tubular spigot 4 extending away from the chamber and defining the outlet therefrom. The spigot 4 is made of resiliently deformable material and has a formation 8 on its outer surface for cooperation with a coacting part 5 of a hole in which the spigot is to be located in use. The spigot is generally provided with a plurality of angularly spaced, longitudinally extending slots 9 through its wall in the vicinity of the formation to allow for radial contraction and this passage of the formation through a hole of diameter roughly equal to that of the spigot.
