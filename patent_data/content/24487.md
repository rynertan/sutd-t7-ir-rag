# Apparatus for treating material by the irradiation thereof.

## Abstract
An apparatus for treating flowable material falling through an irradiation zone 12 in the form of a thin, substan tially nonturbulent, cohesive layer 80 including in combina tion an outlet reservoir 16 adapted to catch the falling mater ial after it is irradiated a source 10 of radiation adapted to direct radiation against the layer 12 as it falls through the irradiation zone and means 6 for forming flowable material flowing through a pipe 20 or similar material transfer means 4 into a thin, substantially nonturbulent, cohesive layer and directing the layer so formed through the irradiation zone, said means 6 having an inlet orifice 8 adapted to receive material from the transfer means and convey it to an upwardly extending transition zone 34 wherein the flow is gradually widened prior to its entry into a gradually upwardly sloped approach zone 38 which terminates at a forward edge 66 over which the material passes in the appropriate form for treatment in the irradiation zone 12 .
