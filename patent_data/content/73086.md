# A system for converting the image information on an original into an electrical signal.

## Abstract
The system comprises a light transmission means for collecting and directing light to a foto electric detector, which light emanates from a light beam scanning an original line wise and which light is reflected by the original. The light transmission means consists of a light transmitting body defined by two specular surfaces parallel to the line to be scanned and extending to the detector and by two specular side surfaces near the ends of the line to be scanned and perpendicular thereto. An internal reflection of said surfaces can be obtained by polishing the body at those places. The light that would reach the detector by direct reflection at the surface of the original is eliminated by bringing about light polarisation effects, e.g. by using polarized light or by providing polarization filters in the path of light.
