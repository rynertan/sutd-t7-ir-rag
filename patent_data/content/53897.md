## Description
Flexible starch bound non asbestos paperThis invention relates to starch bound paper, and provides non asbestos alternatives to starch bound asbestos papers,Starch bound asbestos papers contain asbestos fibres as the predominant raw material, these fibres being bound together with small amounts of hydrolysed starch to provide the necessary strength and flexibility. Such papers find use for a variety of purposes, e.g. as high temperature flexible insulation in electrical equipment.They are commonly made in the form of flexible sheet of thickness 0.1 1.5 mm on conventional paper making machines such as the Fourdrinier. In the process, an aqueous slurry of the ingredients which are to compose the product is progressively dewatered as a layer on a water permeable conveyor usually of wire mesh , the dewatered layer being subsequently compressed and dried.According to the present invention, non asbestos flexible sheet material of thickness 0.1 1.5 mm comprises a matrix of unfired ball clay which is reinforced by fine particles of a non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral and by organic web forming fibres, the whole being bound together by hydrolysed starch said flexible sheet material being made by de watering on a water permeable conveyor a layer of aqueous slurry of unfired ball clay, fine particles of said silicate mineral, organic web forming fibres and hydrolysed starch, and compressing and drying the de watered layer said aqueous slurry containing, by weight of solids content, ball clay 30 60 silicate mineral 25 55 g organic web forming fibres 3 15 hydrolysed starch 2 6 Our British Patent Application 2 031 043A publishedApril 1980 discloses a non asbestos product which comprises a matrix of unfired ball clay containing reinforcement and organic web forming fibres and which contains hydrolysed starch as complementary binder.However, although that product is made on paper makilzg machinery, it is a board, i.e. inflexible compared to paper, and the function of the starch in it is to enable the board to be remoulded when wetted with water.In the product of the present invention referred to in the rest of the description as paper , the ball clay provides a flexible cohesive matrix. Ball clay is a fine grained, highly plastic, mainly kaolinitic sedimentary clay. The terms kaolinitic and kaolinite are mineralogical ones, indicating chemical composition and chemical structure they are not to be confused with the term kaolin , used to denote a highly refractory clay which approaches the mineral kaolinite in chemical composition and structure but which by contrast with ball clay is hardly plastic at all. Various types of ball clay have varying proportions of kaolinite, micaceous material, and quartz, with small amounts of organic matter and other minerals.Ball clays are used mainly in the manufacturing of pottery and refractories, in admixture with other clays such as the kaolin mentioned earlier to impart plasticity to them and to increase the green strength of the unfired ware.The function of the organic web forming fibres is primarily to enable the paper to be formed on conventional paper making machinery, but additionally those fibres impart strength to the ball clay matrix of the finished paper, just as the non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral the primary reinforcement does. The organic web forming fibres are preferably cellulose fibres, but may alternatively be polyethylene or polypropylene fibres of the kind commercially available under the name PULPEX. In the preparation of the aqueous slurry to be dewatered, the web forming fibres are employed at a freeness of 60 90 Schopper Riegler. The reinforcing fine particles of non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral consist of particles capable of passing a sieve of aperture 250 pm.Preferably at least 75 by weight of the particulate non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral present should meet this specification.The non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral employed may be a mica or a chlorite. The chlorites have structures containing infinite two dimensional ions of opposite electrical charge, the negatively charged layers having compositions ranging from Ng3 AlSi3010 OH 2 to Mg2Al Al2Si2Olo OH2 , the positively charged layers having the composition Mg2Al OH 6 . Such non fibrous charged layer silicate minerals are to be distinguished from non fibrous layer sillicate minerals such as kaolinite, talc and pyrophyllite, where the infinite 2 dimensional layers e.g. A12 OEI 4Si205 in kaolinite are uncharged.The hydrolysed starch is preferably a farina starch. The paper may also contain a small proportion, suitably in the range of 1 10 , of rayon fibres, to impart green strength to the sheet material between the dewatering and drying operations, and also to impart additional strength to the finished paper.The density of the paper will ordinarily be in the range 700 1100 kg m3, its tensile strength at least 3 MPa and its burst strength at least 40 KPa.The papers of the invention may be impregnated with other materials, such as resins, to give special properties for particular purposes. They may have surface coatings e.g. of shellac varnish or synthetic resin applied to them. They may also be given a backing e.g. of manilla paper, to increase mechanical strength, especially tensile strength, when that is required in the wrapping of conductors and the like, and they may be incorporated in double or multiple layer constructions with glass threads between adjacent paper layers to give particularly high strength, as when wrapping cables.The invention is further illustrated by the followingExample. EYSLMPLE A. Preparation of Stock i Lapponia pulp bleached softwood sulphate pulp in sheet form was made into an aqueous slurry of solids conent about 3 by weight and treated in a disc refiner until its freeness value was 900 Schopper Riegler. ii The pulp of i 500g. dry weight 16.7kg wet weight was added to 90 litres of water in a mixing tank, and the diluted pulp was agitated vigorously for 1 minute. There were then added, with vigorous stirring non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral mica or chlorite , at least 75 by weight of which passes through a sieve of aperture 250 am ball clay 908 passing a sieve of aperture 5 Sm rayon fibre 3 denier chopped to 3 Omm fibre length farina starch 5 aqueous solution, prepared by heating at 1000C for 5 10 minutes in proportions such that the solids content of the resulting slurry was made up of 46 non fibrous charged layer silicate mineral, 5 cellulose fibres, 40 unfired ball clay, 5 rayon fibres and 4 hydrolysed starch. iii The slurry of ii was diluted to 1 3 solids content.B. Preparation of Paper The stock slurry of A above was made into flexible sheet material in an entirely conventional way on a Fourdrinier flat wire paper machine, such as is described in chapters 10 and 11 of Paper and Board Manufacture by Julius Grant, James H. Young, and Barry G. Watson Publishers Technical Division, the British Paper and Board Industry Federation, London, 1978 . The slurry is progressively dewatered as it travels on the water permeable conveyor of the machine, and the dewatered material is consolidated by pressing between rollers, and then dried to low moisture content suitably 2 by weight .
