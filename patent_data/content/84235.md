# Reverse preselect control.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an automatic control system for a power shift, preselect transmission 10 including a plurality of power paths 36, 38 alternately connectable between input 12 and output 20 shafts by first engaging selected ones of synchronizer clutches 42, 74, 84 associated with each of a plurality speed ratio gears 44,46,76,78,80 in each path and then alternately engaging a powershift clutch 48, 82 associated with each path. The control system includes a hydraulic logic system 118 which may be electronic and a hydraulic and shift valve system which may be electrically controlled should the logic be electronic. The control system preselects ratio gears in a nondriving path and then alter nately engages the powershift clutches to switch driving connections from one path to the other. The logic system includes an improved reverse sequence valve 132 and improved shift valves 124, 126, 129 . The shift valve system includes the feature of trimmer valves 64, 70, 72, 74 to control the engagement rate of the synchronizer clutches and combination trimmer valves 360, 366 to control the engagement rate of the powershift clutches. The logic system further includes the feature of pre selecting reverse when a manual shift valve 700 is in the neutral position.
