## Description
TITLE GAS SEPARATION MEMBRANEAND PROCESS FOR PREPARING IT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process of preparing a gas separation membrane, and the resulting membrane. The membrane is a surface modified aromatic polyamide, polyhydrazide or related amide like polymeric membrane. Prior Art U.S. 4,080,743 U.S. 4,080,744 and U.S.4,120,098 disclose dried assymmetrically porous polyamide membranes suitable for use in the separation of gases. U.S. 4,230,463 discloses gas separation membranes formed by coating a porous polymeric substrate. Summary of the Invention The gas separation membranes of the present invention are prepared by drying an aromatic polyamide or amide like membrane prepared as described in U.S. 3,567,632 using the drying process of any one of U.S. 4,080,743 U.S. 4,080,744 or U.S.4,120,098. The dried membrane is treated with a very dilute solution of a cationic agent in a non polar, volatile organic solvent having a low surface tension. The resulting membranes exhibit improved selectivity in separating mixtures of gases. Detailed Description The polymers useful in preparing the membranes of the present invention contain repeating nits of the formula A B where A is an aromatic moiety of the structureEMI2.1 EMI2.2 where X is O, S,EMI2.3 N alkyl, N phenyl and mixtures of the above, R is an alkyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, R is H or an alkyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and n and m are 1 3 and B is a linking group of the structureEMI3.1 EMI3.2 It is to be understood that the various Blisted include their mirror images. ThusEMI3.3 is intended to includeEMI3.4 groups.These polymers are more fully described in Richter et al. U.S. 3,567,632 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Of these the cast polyamide films derived from mixtures of terephthaloyl chloride and isophthaloyl chloride and meta phenylenediamine are preferred. The meta phenylenediamine may be substituted partially or fully with a sulfonic acid group. Generally the amount of sulfur present as sulfonic acid groups will vary from 0 to 4.5 wt with from 1.5 to 3.8 wt being preferred. Generally the ratio of isophthalyl chloride to terephthalyl chloride is from about 50 50 to 80 20.Generally the polyamide membrane is formed by casting a solution of the aromatic polyamide in a polar organic solvent, such as dimethylacetamide, onto a casting surface or support fabric, evaporating some of the surface of the resulting layer of aromatic polyamide and then quenching with water.The casting solution generally will contain from 15 to 30 wt. 8 aromatic polyamide. The casting solution also contains a modifying salt. Suitable modifying salts include lithium nitrate, lithium chloride and hydrated magnesium chloride. The modifying salt should be present in an amount of from 20 60 wt 8, based on the aromatic polyamide. If a fabric support is used in forming aromatic cast membrane for use in the process of the present invention, it generally will be a woven or non woven unsized polyester or aromatic polyamide fabric. Suitable polyesters are disclosed inWhinfield, U.S. 2,465,319. Suitable aromatic polyamides are disclosed in Sweeny, U.S. 3,287,324. Generally, the aromatic polyamide solution is cast or extruded at from 0 to 1250C and preferably 150 to 350C. The range of 150 to 350C represents ambient temperature and is preferred because of simplicity. The pre membrane as extruded generally will have a thickness of from 1 to 10 mils, 2.5 x 10 m 2.5 x 10 4m . After being cast or extruded the pre membrane is partially dried. The drying is done at 500 to 170or with from 80 to 1500c being preferred. The drying should be done to the extent necessary to leave from 30 to 50 wt. aromatic polyamide in the pre membrane. After the partial drying step, the pre membrane is quenched with water. The quench water should be at from 0 to 300C. and preferably 100 to 250C. Generally, the quenching step will last one or two minutes. While longer quench times can be used they offer no improvement over the quench effect obtained after a few minutes. In fact the membrane is normally stored in water at ambient temperature until it is dried. The quench step serves to gel the polymer and freeze in its structure as well as to extract residual solvent and modifying salt. The membranes of the present invention are from 1 to 10 mils 2.54 x 10 2.54 x l0 4m in thickness and have densities of from 0.5 to 0.8 g cc. The membranes of the present invention are anisotropic. That is they are denser on the side from which the solvent has been evaporated during their preparation. This anisotropic nature can be determined using a scanning electron micrograph or a transmission electron micrograph. The membranes of the present invention can be flat films or tubular in nature. Tubular membranes are formed by casting the aromatic dope on a preformed tubular support followed by performing the remaining process steps disclosed herein. Simply drying the membrane by evaporating the water associated therewith has a deleterious effect on the gas separation properties of the membrane. Thus the membrane should be dried by a technique other than simply evaporating the water.Generally this is done by replacing the water with an organic liquid while maintaining both the water and the organic liquid in the liquid phase. Such techniques are taught in U.S. 4,080,743, U.S.4,080,744 and U.S. 4,120,098. The organic liquid is generally removed from the membrane by evaporation, but need not be if it is compatible with the solvent used to apply the cationic agent to the surface of the membrane. The surface modified membranes of the present invention are prepared by contacting the dense layer of a dried membrane with a very dilute solution of a suitable cationic agent in a nonpolar, volatile solvent of low surface tension. Unlike prior processes involving pore plugging or coatings of membranes with nonreactive materials, the current invention relies on the unexpectedly strong affinity of certain cat ionic agents for nucleophilic sites on the membrane. The bonding appears to be sufficiently strong that a monolayer of the cationic agent is enough to modify permanently the permselective properties of the membrane. The fact that the modification of this invention requires physicochemical interaction between cationic agent and membrane offers the added advantage of elimination of overcoating, regardless of the amount of additive used. The cationic agents, either monomeric or polymeric, generally have strong affinity for the membranes used in this invention. Practical and performance considerations, however, limit their choice to agents soluble in solvents that will not damage the membrane. Suitable solvents must be nonpolar and must have surface tension below 25 dyn. cm 1, preferably below 20 dyn. cm 1. Several hydrocarbons, fluorocarbons, fluorochlorocarbons and water immiscible ethers are satisfactory as solvents. Because of solvent limitations, suitable monomeric or polymeric cationic agents are those having their positively charged function attached to hydrocarbon, halocarbon or ether segments of length necessary to insure complete solubility in the chosen solvent. Examples of such agents include cationic surfactants known by trade names such as Adogens Ashland , Arquads, Ethoquads Armak Zonyls fluoro surfactants Du Pont and several others.These cationic surfactants have the general formulaEMI6.1 where R1 is a C,O 20 alkyl or alkenyl group, CH2CH2CnF 2n l where n is an integer from 8 to 20, or CH2CH O m where m is an integer from CH3 8 to 20 and R2 and R3 are CH3 or 1 andX is Cl , Br or I . ExamplesExample 1 Water wet hollow fibers from a polyaramide made by polycondensation of m phenylenediamine with isophthalyl terephthalyl chlorides 70 30 mixture were dehydrated by the procedure described in U.S.Patent 4,080,743. The dry fibers, 42 filaments having an outer diameter of ca. 100 pm and inner diameter of 40 pm, were assembled into a minipermeator module having an inlet in communication with the exterior of the fibers and an outlet in communication with the interior of the fibers. The active fiber length was 63 cm. The permeator was tested for carbon dioxide and methane permeabilities by feeding one gas at a time through the permeator shell at 400 psig 27.6 x 105 Pa at 250C and measuring its output through the tube side as cubic centimeters per second. Measurement of permeate volume involved timing the displacement of a soap bubble in a 10 ml. burette.Following equilibration of outputs, the permeator was removed from the pressure line and its shell was filled with a 0.05 solution of dialkyl C12 Cl8 dimethyl ammonium chloride cationic surfactant in Freons 113 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane Du Pont .After 15 minute exposure, the fluid was decanted and the permeator shell was rinsed 3 times with FreonE 113 to ascertain removal of unreacted Adogen. complete removal of the solvent was achieved by purging the permeator shell with nitrogen. The so treated permeator was retested for carbon dioxide and methane permeabilities as described above.

A microhoehn is the number of cubic centimeters passed by the membrane at standard temperature and pressure times 106 divided by the area of the membrane in square centimeters X the time in seconds X the pressure on the product side of the membrane in mmHg i.e. cm STP microhoehn cmê.sec cm l g x 106 Example 2 A minipermeator similar to the one described in Example 1 was made using 250 dehydrated hollow fibers each of which is 50 cm long from a polyaramide prepared by polycondensation of m phenylene diamine .89 mole and sulfonated m phenylene diamine .11 mole with the same mixture of diacid chlorides as inExample 1. The permeator was tested for CO2 andCH4 permeabilities, at 400 psig 27.6 x 10 Pa post treated with 0.058 of the cationic agent used inExample 1 in Freon 113 and retested exactly as inExample 1.The results reported in cc sec. are tabulated below Permeabilities Before Treatment After Treatment C02 6.25 3.85CH4 0.96 0.11 CO2 CH4 selectivity 6.5 35Example 3 A permeator similar to the one described inExample 2 was tested for helium and methane permeabilities at 400 psig 27.6 x 105 Pa before and after identical post treatment with the cationic surfactant. Results are tabulated below Permeabilities Before Treatment After TreatmentHelium 29.4 15.6CH4 2.94 0.034He CH4 selectivity 8.3 459Example 4 To differentiate the effect of Freons 113 from that of the cationic agent three minipermeators were prepared as in Example 2.All three permeators were evaluated for helium and methane permeabilities, as in Example 3, to establish initial performance.Following equilibrium readings overnight exposure to 400 psig 27.6 x 105 Pa helium at room temperature . Methane permeabilities were determined to calculate selectivities 2 hours on methane at 400 5 psig 27.6 x 10 Pa . The permeator shells were then filled up with Freonb 113 2 permeator and 0.05 wt. of the cationic agent used in Example 1 in Peons 113 one permeator . After 15 minutes the fluids were decanted and the permeator treated with the cationic agent was filled with plain FreonE 113 to remove any possible excess of the cationic surfactant, then decanted. The permeators were dried by pressuring the shell with helium and slightly opening the reject opening to establish good sweeping of helium through the permeator.Helium permeabilities were determined again after two hours for equilibrium, followed by methane readings to determine selectivities. In an extra step one of the permeators that had been treated with Freone 113 was retreated with the same solvent for 15 minutes, while the second permeator that had been treated with 0.05 wt. of the cationic agent used in Example 1 in FreonE 113 for 15 minutes then rinsed with FreonS 113 and dried as previously. Helium and methane permeabilities were redetermined. The results are tabulated below all tests were run at 400 psig measurements in cc sec., then converted to micro Hoehns .
