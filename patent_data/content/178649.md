## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and, particularly, to a complementary monolithic semiconductor device including a p type well and an n type well. As is well known in the art, there are two conductivity types in semiconductor, i.e., p type and n type. Semiconductor elements involving the structure of these opposite conductivity types include complementary elements such as pnp and npn bipolar junction transistors BJT and p channel and n channel field effect transistors FET . CMOS devices comprising n channel MOS FETs and p channel MOS FETs have the features of low power dissipation and high integration density, and are particularly suitable for use in logic circuits. Npn BJTs have the advantages of fast operation and large output. For making semiconductor integrated circuits capable of achieving various functions, it is often required to form various semiconductor elements on the same substrate. In such cases, semiconductor substrates including p type and n type regions of relatively low impurity concentration are often required. For example, a CMOS large scale integrated circuit LSI is fabricated by forming n channel MOS FETs in the p type well and p channel MOS FETs in the n type well. A BI CMOS LSI generally includes further n type wells each of which includes an npn BJT, in addition to the CMOS structure. In semiconductor integrated circuits, isolation between elements is needed. In MOS FETs, charge carriers flow from the source to the drain along the surface, and isolation in the semiconductor bulk is usually unnecessary. In case the channel is induced along the surface, there is a risk of creating a parasitic MOS FET, and therefore each MOS FET is often surrounded by a region of high impurity concentration serving as a channel stopper. LOGOS local oxidation of silicon technique, in which thick oxide films are formed selectively, is also employed in many cases. In a CMOS integrated circuit, a p type well and n type well coexist. The contiguous disposition of a p type well including n channel MOS FETs and an n type well including p channel MOS FETs entails a pnpn four layer structure, resulting possibly in the formation of a parasitic thyristor. Turning on of this thyristor causes latch up , precluding the related MOS FETs from operating as expected. In order to prevent latch up, the pnp and npn BJTs constituting the thyristor need to have low current amplification factors β pnp and β npn . This requirement may be met by increasing the thickness and or increasing the impurity concentration of the n region and p region which serve as base regions of these BJTs. One countermeasure is to form a p type well in an n type substrate the remaining n type region becomes an n type well and form n channel MOS FETs and p channel MOS FETs in the p type well and the n type well, respectively, with a groove formed deeper than the p type well around the p type well side wall portion of the pn junction . The groove surface may be covered with the insulator and filled with an appropriate filler material. In the surface of the p type well n type regions for n channel MOS FET are doped, and in the surface of the n type well p type regions for p channel MOS FET are doped. The current path between the p type and n type regions is lengthened by the groove. In order to increase the distance from the p type region via the n type well substrate to the p type well, the groove is made to have a width of 1 µm and a depth of 5.5 µm, for example. A shallow p type well allows the npn type BJT, which is made up of the n type region, p type well and n type well substrate , to have a larger current amplification factor β npn , and therefore the p type well is also made deeper, e.g., 4 µm or more. Reference is made to Proceedings of Meeting of the Japanese Society of Applied Physics, March 1982, p 692. However, despite the above dimensional consideration, the current amplification factor β npn of the npn BJT can be non negligibly large, and also there is a risk of punch through between the n type region and the n type well substrate . In the case of BI CMOS including vertical npn BJTs and CMOS FETs, the n type well including an npn BJT has an n type sub collector buried region at the bottom. An n type well for the npn BJT and n type and p type wells for the CMOS FETs are formed in the p type substrate. When the n type and p type wells for the CMOS FETs are provided at the bottom with an n type and p type buried regions, a noise current flowing in the wells can be drawn rapidly due to a reduced well resistance , and the current amplification factor of the parasitic BJT can be suppressed small due to the presence of the base region having a high impurity concentration. However, if the p type well and n type well are disposed contiguously, resulting in the formation of the lateral BJT structure, the effect of latch up prevention is limited. In the npn BJT, the potential varies even in the semiconductor bulk. Insulation for the npn BJT is made by surrounding its periphery with a thick thermal oxidation film which reaches the substrate, with a p type region being pushed down by the oxidation front and located under the oxide film. An oxide isolation region may also be provided between the p type and n type wells for the CMOS FETs. Reference is made to Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 57 188862. However, it is unavoidable that the buried region is expanded by further diffusion during the heat process. Diffusion can occur not only in the vertical depth direction, but also in the lateral direction. In order to separate the buried sub collector sufficiently from the buried region of the contiguous well after the heat process, the oxide isolation region must be as wide as 6 7 µm or more. Such a dimension of the isolation region makes a bar against the improvement in the packing density. Furthermore, when a p region is formed under the oxide adjacent to the n type sub collector for the isolation of the BJT, the capacitance of the npn BJT becomes large due to the p n junction, hampering the enhancement of the operating speed. A preferred form of isolation for a complementary integrated circuit is the use of an SOS substrate with the provision of oxide isolation reaching the saphire substrate. Even in this case, reduction in the well resistance is limited, and the problem of increased manufacturing cost will result. Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 7, no. 36 E 158 1181 , Febr. 15, 1983 JP A 57 188 862 discloses a monolithic complementary semiconductor device comprising the features of the precharacterizing part of claim 1, wherein the insulating member has its bottom being shallower than the bottoms of both embedded regions and the n type embedded region. US A 4 477 310 discloses to make similar insulating members entirely of SiO₂. EP A 0 090 111 discloses to provide channel stop regions on both sides of isolation regions in a semiconductor device. An object of this invention is to provide a monolithic complementary semiconductor device which has a high latch up voltage, prevents the creation of a lateral parasitic thyristor and prevents the embedded regions from forming a pn junction of high capacitance. Said object is achieved, according to the present invention, by a monolithic complementary semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor substrate region of a first conductivity type semiconductor embedded regions of high impurity concentration disposed on said substrate region and comprising at least a first embedded region of said first conductivity type and a second embedded region disposed adjacent to said first embedded region and having a second conductivity type which is opposite to said first conductivity type semiconductor well regions of low impurity concentration compared to said embedded regions and disposed on said embedded regions forming a main surface, and comprising at least a first well region of the first conductivity type disposed on said first embedded region and a second well region of the second conductivity type disposed on said second embedded region and an insulating member extending from said main surface into said substrate region between said first well and embedded regions and said second well and embedded regions, characterized in that the insulating member extends deeper than the embedded regions and thereby separates said first well and embedded regions from said second well and embedded regions. The buried embedded regions decrease the well resistance, decrease the diffusion length of minority carriers, and prevent latch up effectively. The dielectric isolation groove deeper than the buried regions prevents the creation of a lateral parasitic thyristor, realizes a narrow isolation region, and prevents the both buried regions from forming a pn junction of high capacitance. A region with the impurity concentration higher than that of the substrate region may be provided at the bottom of the dielectric isolation groove. Such a region is effective for preventing punch through in the periphery of the buried sub collector of the BJT. In fabricating a CMOS integrated circuit, isolation between each MOS FET is basically unnecessary, and therefore more than one MOS FET may be formed within a well. By making at least one p type well and at least one n type well, with a desired number of n channel MOS FETs and a desired number of p channel MOS FETs being formed in the p type well and n type well, respectively, and with connection being made between both types of FETs, a desired CMOS integrated circuit can be fabricated. In the case of BI CMOS, each BJT needs to be isolated from the surrounding elements, and therefore it is desirable to provide a dielectric isolation groove around each BJT. More preferably, the dielectric isolation groove is provided at its bottom with a buried buffer region with a higher impurity concentration. The buried buffer region is preferably disposed deeper than and separated from the buried region at the well bottom. The dielectric isolation groove is of any structure provided that it substantially serves as a dielectric isolation groove. For example, it can be realized by high resistance polysilicon coated with oxide and or nitride. For the better understanding of the present invention, a comparison example of isolation in a CMOS integrated circuit c.f. Proceeding of Meeting of the Japanese Society of Applied Physics, March 1982, p 692 which is incorporated by reference will first be described in connection with Fig. 9. In the figure, a p channel MOS transistor 62 and an n channel MOS transistor 61 are separated from each other by a dielectric insulation region 21 made of oxide film and polycrystalline silicon dimensioned by 1 µm in width and 5.5 µm in depth. The isolation region 21 is made deeper than the p type well 30 so that the pnp parasitic BJT has an increased base width as shown by the arrow A in the figure, with the intention of decreasing the current amplification factor of the pnp parasitic BJT and thus increasing the latch up voltage. However, because the npn parasitic BJT in the portion indicated by the arrow B has a vertical transistor structure and the p well 30 serving as a base layer has a low impurity concentration, the npn parasitic BJT is expected to have a considerably large current amplification factor. On this account, the pnpn structure may possibly create a thyristor which may be turned on. In addition, the p type region 30 may possibly be punched through. Figs. 10a and 10b show a comparison example of BI CMOS integrated circuit c.f. Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 57 188862, published on Nov. 19, 1982 which is incorporated by reference hereby . On the surface of a p type semiconductor substrate 1 which is provided with embedded or buried regions 2 and 3, an n type epitaxial layer 4 is grown to a thickness of about 2 µm. Portions of the epitaxial layer are converted to p type regions. Respective regions in the epitaxial layer 4 is isolated by an insulator 5 made of a thick silicon oxide SiO₂ film. A p region 27 pushed down by the oxide region 5 is disposed to surround the n sub collector 2. Elements formed include an npn bipolar transistor 63, a p channel MOS transistor 62 and an n channel MOS transistor 61. Embedded between the epitaxial layer 4 and the p type semiconductor substrate 1 are n buried regions 2 in the portions of the bipolar transistor and pMOS transistor, and a p buried region 3 in the portion of the nMOS transistor. The foregoing structure poses a serious problem in isolating, for example, the n buried regions 2 located on both sides of the isolation region 5. The n buried regions are subjected to various heat processes during the formation of elements, and they diffuse not only in the depth direction, but also in the lateral direction as shown by Fig. 10b. The n buried regions 2 have their side faces diffusing in the lateral direction shown by the arrows in the figure. As a result, the distance between the adjacent n buried regions 2 becomes smaller than the width of the isolation region 5. Since the n buried regions 2 have the isolation breakdown voltage determined from the distance between them, it is necessary to design a wider isolation region 5 so as to accomodate the lateral diffusion of the n buried regions 2, when it is intended to ensure a desired breakdown voltage. Therefore, it is difficult to realize a high density semiconductor integrated device by decreasing the isolation width. In practice, it has not been feasible to make the isolation region 5 narrower than 7 6 µm. The buried regions 2 are disposed in contact with the p buried region 25. When high impurity concentration regions are in contact with each other, a large electrostatic capacitance is created at the contact surfaces. The n buried region 2 is the collector region of the npn bipolar transistor 63, and a large capacitance results in a low operating speed. Accordingly, the structure of the n buried regions 2 and p buried region 3 in contact with each other is undesirable from the viewpoint of speeding up the operation of the circuit. Next, embodiments of the present invention will be described. Fig. 1 shows a semiconductor chip according to this invention. In a surface of a p type substrate 1, n type embedded or buried region 2 and p type embedded or buried regions 3 of high impurity concentration are formed, and then an n type region 20 and p type regions 30 are formed, respectively thereon. The n buried region 2 and n region 20 in unison constitute an n type well 22, while each p buried region 3 and a p region 30 in unison constitute a p type well 23. At the boundary of the p type well 23 and the n type well 22, a narrow groove is formed deep into the substrate region 1, which is filled with the insulation filler to form a dielectric isolation region 21. It is important for the dielectric isolation regions to extend through the lightly doped regions 20 and 30 and the heavily doped buried regions 2 and 3, thereby isolating the n type well 22 from the p type wells 23 effectively. Fig. 2 shows another embodiment of this invention, in which like portions to those in Fig. 1 are indicated by the like numerals or symbols. In the arrangement, another n type well 24 is defined in the n type well 22, and surrounded by the dielectric isolation regions 21. There is also another dielectric isolation region 21 between the p well 23 and the n well 22. Each isolation region 21 extends through the buried regions 2 and 3 into the substrate region 1. Further, a p buried region 25 of higher concentration than the p substrate region 1 is provided at the bottom to the isolation region 21 so that it is in contact with the lower portion of each isolation region 21. This p buried region is effective for the separation between adjacent n buried regions 2. For example, the buried region 25 prevents shortcircuitting of the wells 24 and 22 that would occur when part of the substrate region 1 in contact with the surface of the isolation region 21 is inverted, and also prevents the p substrate 1 from being punched through between adjacent n buried regions 2 when a BJT is formed in the well 24. The arrangement of Fig. 2 is particularly suited for fabricating BI CMOS LSI. Forming a groove is prone to create crystal defects and the like at portions near the groove wall, and therefore regions near the groove are apt to be inferior in electronical characteristics. Moreover, separation of MOS FETs needs a LOGOS region. Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a chip which is provided with thick oxide films LOCOS inside the wells and between the wells. The thick oxide film 26 formed over the dielectric isolation region 21 prevents the MOS FET formed in the well from being in direct contact with the isolation region 21, and it is beneficial to the reduction of leak current. Fig. 4 is a plan view showing an example of the chip layout. In the p type region 30, n type wells 22 surrounded by the dielectric isolation regions 21, and a pn isolated n type well 28 are formed. The dielectric isolation region is not always needed between wells, as shown, and it may be provided only for the necessary portions. Fig. 5 shows part of a CMOS integrated circuit. On a p type substrate 1, an n buried region 2 and p buried region 3 are formed, on which are formed an n region 20 and p region 30, respectively. P regions 9 are formed in the n type well 22 to form the source and drain of a p channel MOS FET 62, while n regions 6 are formed in the p type wall 30 to form the source and drain of an n channel MOS FET 61. A channel stopper 16 is formed around the source and drain regions 6 below the thick oxide film 26. Over the channel region between the source and drain, a gate electrode 8 of polysilicon or the like is formed through a gate insulation film 7 of oxide or the like. The source and drain regions are provided with source and drain electrodes 100. A dielectric isolation region 21 is provided around the n type well 22 including the p channel MOS FET 62. The isolation region 21 isolates the nMOS transistor 61 from the pMOS transistor 62. The isolation region 21 may be made of a silicon oxide SiO₂ film and polycrystalline silicon surrounded by the oxide film. The isolation region 21 extends at the foundary between the n type well 22 and the p type well 23, through n buried region 2 and p buried region 3 into the p type semiconductor substrate 1. The foregoing structure allows a significant enhancement of the resistance against the latch up phenomenon specific to CMOS. Latch up is caused by the parasitic thyristor effect arising between the pMOS transistor 62 and the nMOS transistor 61. The structure shown in Fig. 5 has the dielectric isolation region 21 extending through the buried regions 2 and 3, and therefore the parasitic thyristor does not turn on. The reason is that the p buried region 3 and n buried region 2 exist in the base region of the parasitic npn and pnp transistors, respectively, preventing the diffusion of minority carriers. As a result, the current gain falls, and a semiconductor device with further enhanced latch up voltage can be obtained. Furthermore, this embodiment provides a new effect as will be described in the following. In the example shown in Fig. 9, the p type region 30 generally needs to have a depth of 4 µm or more in order to prevent the p region 30 from being punched through. Therefore, the dielectric isolation layer 21 has a depth of at least 4 µm. In this embodiment, the problem of punch through concerns with the n region 20. The n region 20 is followed at its bottom by the n buried layer 2, and therefore punch through does not occur even if the n region 20 is made thinner. The n region 20 may have a depth of 0.5 2.0 µm, or typically 1 um, while the n buried region 2 may have a depth of 0.5 3.0 µm, or typically 1.5 µm. The dielectric isolation region 21 has a depth so that the region at least extends through the buried region, e.g., as deep as 2 5 µm and it can be a shallow isolation region 21 as compared with the comparison example. Generally, the isolation region 21 is formed by etching or milling a deep groove in a semiconductor layer using the dry etching technique. The deeper the groove is, the more serious problems arise as concerns the decrease in the machining or processing accuracy and the occurrence of distortion or lattice defects by the machining or processing. Accordingly, the presence of the buried region in this embodiment allows a shallower isolation region 21, which significantly facilitates the device fabricating process. The location of the groove is aligned or registered with the boundary of buried regions. Here, when the width of a groove is 1 µm, there is a positional tolerance of 0.5 µm on each side of the desired location i.e. boundary . Even when the location of the groove is displaced more than this tolerance, it only results in occurrence of a small region of opposite conductivity type at the bottom portion of a well. Such a small region does not produce particularly harmful effect. The isolation region 21 surrounds the n type well region 22 and isolates it electrically from the p type well region 23. It is not necessary to provide dielectric isolation for all the n type well regions 22, but the dielectric isolation region may be provided only in necessary portions for the latch up resistance or the like. The n type well at the right end of the figure is only provided with a pn isolation. Moreover, according to this embodiment, since the side face of the n buried region 2 is defined by the dielectric isolation region 21 which extends through the buried regions 2 and 3, adverse influences by the lateral diffusion of the n buried region, as explained in the example shown in Figs. 10a and 10b can be avoided. This allows the dielectric isolation region 21 to have a decreased width from 6 7 µm of the case of Figs. 10a and 10b down to 1 2 µm. Moreover, according to this embodiment, the n buried region 2 is in contact at its circumference with the isolation region 21, and is separated from the p buried region 3, resulting in a smaller electrostatic capacitance at the circumferencial portion. Thus, a fast operating integrated circuit can be realized. Next, an example of the fabricating process for the above mentioned CMOS integrated circuit will be described in connection with Figs. 6a 6h. First, n to be buried regions 2 and p to be buried regions 3 are formed in a surface region of a p type silicon substrate 1 as shown in Fig. 6a, and thereafter an n type epitaxial layer 10 having a substantially uniform distribution of impurity concentration is grown on the substrate 1 to a thickness of about 2 µm. The surface of the epitaxial layer 10 is subjected to oxidation so that a thin oxide film 12 of about 50 nm in thickness is formed, which is then coated with a nitride Si₃N₄ film 13. Next, selective etching is conducted to partially remove the nitride film 13 at areas registered with the n buried regions 2, while leaving the nitride film over the p buried regions 3. The conventional photoresist process is employed for the above selective etching. Next, phosphorus is doped by ion implantation into portions where the nitride film 13 is absent. Phosphorus is implanted through the thin oxide film 12 into the surface of the n type epitaxial layer 10, and an n type region 20 is formed in the subsequent processing step. Portions coated with the nitride film 13 is not doped with phosphorus due to masking by the film 13. Following the phosphorous ion implantation, the wafer is heat treated in an oxidizing atmosphere, with the result that the oxide film on the phosphorus doped region further grows, while no oxidation takes place in portions coated with the nitride film and the original thin oxide thickness is retained, as shown in Fig. 6b. In this embodiment, the thicker portion 14 of the oxide film is made 150 nm. Fig. 6b shows the state when the nitride film 13 is removed. Next, the entire wafer surface is coated with a thick nitride film 13 to a thickness of about 200 nm, and part of the nitride film where the dielectric isolation region is to be formed is removed, as shown in Fig. 6c. Thereafter, silicon is dry etched through the mask of nitride film, and a groove 15 of about 1 2 µm in width and 3 4 µm in depth is formed. It may be preferable to lightly wet etch the dry etched groove surface to remove the contamination and the damaged layer. Next, the interior wall of the groove is oxidized so that an oxide film 210 is formed to a thickness of about 200 nm as shown in Fig. 6d. Then, polycrystalline silicon 211 of high resistivity is embedded in the groove, and the surface of the polycrystalline silicon exposed at the opening of the groove is oxidized to an oxide film. In such a way, the dielectric isolation region 21 is completed. After removing the nitride film 13, boron is implanted on the entire wafer surface. Since the region doped with phosphorus in the process of Fig. 6a has the thick oxide film 14 see Fig. 6b , boron is not implanted in this area. Whereas, the oxide film in portion 12 not doped with phosphorus remains thin, and boron is implanted into the surface of the n type epitaxial layer 10 in this area. Next, the doped phosphorus and boron are diffused at a temperature of 1000 1200 C until they reach the n and p embedded regions 2 and 3. Thus, n regions 20 and p regions 30 are formed, as shown in Fig. 6e. A nitride film 13 is formed again, and is patterned to leave portions referred to as active regions 60 on the surface of the n region 20 and p region 30 where semiconductor elements such as MOS transistors will be made later. Then, boron implantation is conducted on the patterned wafer. Boron is implanted only in the portion where there is no nitride film and no thick oxide film as shown by 16. This implanted region serves as a channel stopper for the nMOS transistor. Next, local oxidation is conducted using the above nitride film so that a field oxide film 11 with a thickness of 1 µm is formed in portions excluding the active regions 60, as shown in Fig. 6f. Next, the oxide film is removed from the active regions 60 and, after a high quality gate oxide film 7 is formed again to a thickness of 50 nm, polycrystalline silicon is deposited to a thickness of 0.3 µm by the chemical vapor deposition CVD method. Then, the polycrystalline silicon layer is patterned as desired to form the gates 8 of MOS FETs, as shown in Fig. 6g. Next, by the self alignment method using the above polycrystalline silicon gate, the source drain regions 9 of pMOS FET are formed in the active surface region of the n region 20 and the source drain regions 6 of nMOS FET are formed in the active surface region of the p region 30, as shown in Fig. 6h. In this embodiment, the nMOS source and drain 6 are formed by arsenic ion implantation and the pMOS source and drain 9 are formed by boron implantation to a depth of 0.3 µm and 0.4 µm, respectively. Following the formation of the source and drain, a passivation film 18 of phosphosilicate glass is formed to a thickness of 0.5 µm, and then contact windows 17 are opened. Finally, wirings 100 of aluminium or the like are formed and a final passivation layer 110 is coated to complete the device shown in Fig. 5. Although the dielectric isolation region 21 was described as a groove filled with oxide and poly Si, any material or combination of materials can be used provided that it can serve as a dielectric isolation. It may be formed of an insulator or a combination of insulators such as oxide, nitride and organic insulators. Alternatively, it may be an insulator coated semiconductor. Also, although vertical grooves having substantially vertical side walls were shown, the grooves may have other cross sectional shapes. For example, the side wall may be slanted as in V groove. Fig. 7 is a schematic cross sectional view of a BI CMOS ingegrated circuit, in which the same or equivalent portions to those in Fig. 5 are referred to by similar numerals or symbols. This embodiment differs from the previous one shown in Fig. 5 in that an npn vertical bipolar transistor 63 is formed in the n region 24. The bipolar transistor 63 has an emitter region 41 formed of heavily doped n type polycrystalline silicon 42. An n type region is diffused therefrom into the single crystal Si region. A p type base region 43 and collector contact region 44 are formed by the ion implantation, as employed in the usual BJT process. The bipolar transistor 63 is isolated from each other by the dielectric isolation region 21 described in connection with Fig. 5. For avoiding punch through and formation of an npn parasitic transistor between the n buried regions, a p type buffer region 25, as mentioned in connection with Fig. 2, is further formed under the dielectric isolation region 21. The p type region 25 is distanced from the n type embedded subcollector region 2. Due to on chip integration of bipolar transistors and CMOS transistors, this embodiment realizes a novel LSI device having both properties of high driving ability featured by bipolar transistors and high integration and low power dissipation featured by CMOS. Moreover, the use of the deep dielectric isolation region 21 of insulator for the above bipolar transistor enables a smaller collector capacitance, whereby speed up of the circuit can be enhanced. Although CMOS transistors and npn bipolar transistors are integrated in the foregoing embodiment, this invention is not limited to such a combination, but can also be applied to the integration of various types of semiconductor elements. As described above, semiconductor elements formed in well regions of different conductivity types can be integrated at a high density on a single chip without causing latch up or punch through, whereby an integrated circuit with superior isolation can be obtained. Figs. 8a 8ℓ show another example of the method for fabricating wells having isolation regions suitable for use in the foregoing embodiments. Initially, a surface of an epitaxial silicon substrate 1 having a buried layer is subjected to thermal oxidation to form a thermal oxide film 35 of 430 Å, for example, as shown in Fig. 8a. Next, an oxidation resistance mask 36, e.g., a silicon nitride film, of 1500 Å in thickness is deposited and a polysilicon film 33 with a thickness of 1000 Å is further deposited thereon. A polysilicon HLD film 37 with a thickness of 5000 Å is formed on the polysilicon film 33 by high temperature, low pressure deposition HLD . Formation of an oxide film 35 is not compulsory. The HLD film 37 formed on the polysilicon film 33 may be of different material provided that it has an etching rate faster enough than that for the films 36 and 33 for a selected wet etching. The thickness of the film 37 is so selected that it will not be etched off entirely until the coming processing step 8g. The films 35, 36, 33 and 37 are given an arbitrary total thickness provided that they will not be etched off during the process until the isolation groove is formed. Subsequently, a photoresist 38 is patterned in the usual photolithographic process as shown in Fig. 8b, and then the HLD film 37 and polysilicon film 38 are removed by the dry etching method as shown in Fig. 8c. Next, wet etching is conducted using ammonia fluoride liquid, for example, so that the HLD film 37 is removed in narrow pattern portions, and a narrow polysilicon section 39 is formed as shown in Fig. 8d. For wide pattern portions, a section 34 with missing HLD film 37 on it is formed by side etching. Next, the photoresist 38 is removed, and by conducting dry etching until the silicon nitride film is removed, narrow patterns 39 and 34 are formed as shown in Fig. 8e. The condition of wet etching shown in Fig. 8d is determined such that the HLD film on the narrow pattern 39 is removed and a predetermined width of the pattern 34 is obtained. Setting of the width of the pattern 39 on the photomask is restricted by the value twice or less the setup width for the pattern 34. Using a film, instead of the HLD film 37, which meets the wet etching condition faster enough than that for both of the silicon oxide film and silicon nitride film, etching may be continued until the oxide film 35 is exposed in Fig. 8c. In this case, the polysilicon silm 33 may be dispensed with. Next, n type impurity phosphorus is implanted to portions where the oxide film 35 is exposed by ion implantation as shown in Fig. 8f, and an n type layer is formed. Next, the polysilicon film remaining in portions 39 and 34 is removed, or otherwise this may be removed after the subsequent oxidation shown in Fig. 8g. Next, the silicon nitride film 36 is used as a mask to form a thermal oxide film 35 to a thickness of 4000 Å, for example, as shown in Fig. 8g. The oxide film 35 is made thick enough so as to be used as a mask for ion implantation following silicon cry etching described later. Next, by removing the silicon nitride film in the pattern portions 39 and 34 using hot phosphoric acid liquid, for example, and then by etching the oxide film, narrow regions of exposed silicon are formed as shown in Fig. 8h. Next, silicon is dry etched to form grooves 19 as shown in Fig. 8i. Next, when necessary, a channel stopper or buffer region 25 is formed at the bottom of each groove through the ion implanting of boron fluoride, for example, and the annealing process. Next, the remaining HLD film 37 is removed and, after the silicon nitride film 36 has been removed using hot phosphoric acid liquid, p type impurity such as boron fluoride is ion implanted to form a p type diffusion layer as shown in Fig. 8i. For this process, the oxide film 35 must have a sufficient thickness so that it works as a mask of boron fluoride implantation. If necessary, oxidation may be conducted again before removal of the silicon nitride film 36. Thereafter, the isolation groove is filled by the conventional process and the dielectric isolation region is formed. For example, after the interior wall of the groove is oxidized, it is coated with a silicon nitride film 18, and then the groove is filled with polycrystalline silicon 19 as shown in Fig. 8k. Next, the selective oxidation region is patterned, and selective oxidation is conducted by forming a channel stopper 16 through the ion implantation of boron fluoride, for example, in the selective oxidation region on the p type diffusion layer. The process for reducing the stepping of the oxide film is added here when necessary, and the dielectric isolation region is completed as shown in Fig. 8ℓ. This process provides a semiconductor structure with the formation of dielectric isolation grooves at the boundary between p type and n type diffusion region and at arbitrary position in the n type diffusion region. Finally, bipolar and CMOS structures are formed in respective isolated regions by the conventional method, and the semiconductor device is completed. The foregoing processes may be modified in such a way of exchanging the position of the silicon nitride film 36 and the polysilicon film 33, or providing another coat of film to realize a structure of three layers or more. Alternatively, a single layer of silicon nitride film may be formed to an appropriate thickness in place of the combination of the silicon nitride film 36 and polysilicon film 33, and etching may be done up to the mid point of the thickness. Although in the foregoing embodiment grooves are formed at the boundary between p type and n type diffusion layers and in an n type diffusion layer, it will be appreciated that the present invention is applicable to the structure having isolation grooves at the boundary between p type and n type regions and possibly at arbitrary position in any n or p type region, the structure having isolation grooves at the boundary between regions or different concentration of p type or n type and at arbitrary position in one type of region, and the structure having isolation grooves at arbitrary position in a single p type or n type diffusion region, etc.
