# Voltage mode printhead drive with sensing at the printhead.

## Abstract
A voltage mode printhead drive for a resistive ribbon 20 employs sensing electrodes 7a contiguous to drive electrodes 1a through 1n. Electrodes 7a sense the return voltage from the drive electrodes to ground. Electrodes 7a are mounted in and are a part of the printhead.
