# Method for passivating aluminum based metallizations.

## Abstract
Aluminium based alloy films and metallization layers that are patterned by reactive ion etching RIE are pas sivated by etching surface portions of the films or layers with a phosphoric chromic mixture to remove contaminants and then oxidizing the exposed surface portions in an oxy gen atmosphere.
