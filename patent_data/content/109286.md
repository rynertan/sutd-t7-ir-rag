# Image stabilizers for vesicular film.

## Abstract
Stabilizers for vesicular imaging compositions are shown. Derivatives of benzoic acid are used to improve the image stabi lity of vesicular imaging compositions containing homopoly mers or copolymers of Î± chloroacrylonitrile, and a light sensitive agent which decomposes and releases gas on irradia tion.
