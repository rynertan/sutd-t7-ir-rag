# Active voltage divider.

## Abstract
An active voltage divider providing output voltage overload protection operably effective in the event failure of the primary resistor should occur. Comprising the divider circuit is a differential amplifier 24 operable as an integra tor, a first pair of grounded diodes CR₁, CR₂ providing primary over voltage protection for a first summing junction 1 of the amplifier and a second pair of grounded diodes CR₃, CR₄ providing voltage backup protection for a second summing junction 2 of the amplifier.
