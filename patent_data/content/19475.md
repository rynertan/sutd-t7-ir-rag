# PROCESS FOR PREPARING ADJACENTLY DISUBSTITUTED KETONES, NOVEL PROSTAGLANDINS E1 AND ANTI THROMBOTIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM

## Abstract
Novel 7 hydroxyprostaglandins E₁, or stereoisomers thereof, or protected derivatives thereof, having the following formula Also provided is a process for producing adjacently disubstituted ketones including the above novel compounds, which process comprises reacting an α, β unsaturated carbonyl compound with a cuprous salt and an organolithium compound in an aprotic inert organic medium in the presence of trialkylphosphine, the amounts of said cuprous salt and said organolithium compound being substantially equimolar, and reacting the product with a protected acetal derivative of an organic carbonyl compound or an aldehyde in the presence of a Lewis acid if necessary followed by reacting the product with a proton donor.
