# IMPROVED EXPRESSION VECTOR AND USE THEREOF

## Abstract
A novel Escherichia coli plasmid is described. The plasmid has, between the Shine Dalgarno sequence and the translation start codon, a base sequence different from the corresponding, originally occurring region in the β galactosidase operon and contains, upstream therefrom, the region of a hybrid promoter between the Escherichia coli trp promoter and the lac promoter and, at an entirely indepen dent site, a lac promoter repressor gene. Employing an Escherichia coli transformant carrying the plasmid, a useful polypeptide such ash IFN γ can be produced in high yield.
