# An improved controller for a videotape recorder, and a method therefor.

## Abstract
An improved controller for a VTR is disclosed. The VTR has a time code reader and a tape time reader, each gener ating a signal representative of the time length of the mate rial recorded on the tape. The time code reader generates a signal derived from the time code recorded on the tape. The tape time reader generates a signal derived from the si gnals generated by a tachometer, connected to the tape transport mechanism. An interpolated time code is gener ated by means which adds an offset value to this tachometer derived time data. The offset value is periodically calcu lated by means which determines the difference between the time code data and the tachometer time code data after first determining that the tape speed has exceeded a prede termined threshold speed for a predetermined period of time. If the tape speed has not exceeded this predetermined threshold speed, then the last calculated offset is added to the tachometer derived data.
