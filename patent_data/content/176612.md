# Centrifugal heating unit.

## Abstract
A centrifugal heating unit includes a circular plate unit mounted on a rotatable shaft in a housing. A motor rotates the shaft and spins the plate unit in a heating chamber within the housing. The plate unit is immersed in multi viscosity synthetic oil in the chamber. The plate unit includes first and second circular disks of equal diameter which are attached to and separated by a spacer disk of smaller diameter. A peripheral buffeting area is formed between the disks outside the perimeter of the separator plate. Each disk of the plate unit is provided with slots equally spaced around the periphery, extending from the separator plate out to near the perimeter of the disk. The chamber is defined by a plurality of planar walls which meet at opposed corners about a periphery of the chamber in cross section perpendicular to the shaft. As the plate unit rotates, oil is sheared by the slots and forced against the chamber walls, which are in close tolerance to the peripheries of the disks. The combined shearing and pressurization generates heat in the oil. The hot oil heats the housing, from which heat is transferred to warm the ambient air.
