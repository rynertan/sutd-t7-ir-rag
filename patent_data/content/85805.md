## Description
ENCAPSULATION AND ENCAPSULATED PRODUCTS This invention relates to a method of encapsulation and to encapsulated products involving a microbial capsule. The encapsulation of various substances for protection or to delay reactivity is well known. InU.S. Patent Specification 4,001,480 it has been proposed to make encapsulated products by contacting fat soluble substances with fungi having a very high natural fat content. According to that patent specification the substances must be soluble in the natural fat, or lipid, of the fungi and the fungi must have a natural fat content of about 40 6096 by weight. Thus for instance, if it is desired to encapsulate a dye within the fungus, the dye must be soluble in the natural fat of the fungus. It is now found that it is possible to encapsulate a dye or other encapsulatable material satisfactorily in a microbe having a natural fat, i.e.lipid, content of less than 4096 by weight. This is achieved by taking a microbe having a low lipid content, and treating it with i a lipid extending substance which will be taken into the microbe and thereby extend the lipid content of the microbe and ii a dye or other material which is soluble or dispersible in the lipidextending substance so that the material is absorbed by the microbe. It is also found that this technique enables the encapsulation of a dye or other material which is insoluble in the lipid of the microbe provided that it is soluble or dispersible in the lipid extending substance.Further, it is possible to extend the lipid content even when it is already 4096 or more. Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, a method of extending the lipid content of a grown microbe comprises treating the grown microbe with an organic lipid extending substance as hereinafter defined so that the substance is taken up by the microbe and is retained passively within the microbe. According to another aspect of the present invention, a method of producing an encapsulated material comprises extending the lipid content of a grown microbe as described in the immediately preceding paragraph and treating the microbe with a material which is soluble or micro dispersible in the organic lipid extending substance, either at the same time as the treatment with the organic lipid extending substance or after the organic lipid extending substance has been taken up by the microbe, or both, so that the material is taken into the microbe and is retained passively therein. According to a further aspect of the present invention, a method of encapsulating within a microbe a material which is not soluble in the lipid of the microbe comprises treating the microbe with i an organic lipidextending substance as hereinafter defined which is a solvent or dispersing medium for the material, so that the substance is taken up by the microbe and is passively retained within the microbe, and ii a solution or microdispersion of the material either at the same time as the treatment with the organic lipid extending substance or after the organic lipid extending substance has been taken up by the microbe, or both, so that the material is taken up by the microbe and is retained passively therein. According to the present invention also there are provided lipid extended grown microbes and encapsulated materials having the features resulting from the methods defined herein. By the term grown microbe there is meant a microbe which has been harvested from its culture medium.The microbe preferably should have a significant lipid content, particularly at least 10, by weight and for example 20, to 3596 by weight, although microbes having higher lipid contents may also be treated in accordance with this invention. A preferred microbe is a fungus, particularly a yeast and especially an oleaginous yeast.If necessary, the lipid content of a microbe may be increased to the desired level by cultivation under reduced nitrogen conditions. Examples of suitable microbes are Linomyces species such as liPofer and starkeyi, TrichosPoron species such as Pullulans and cutaneum, and Candida species such as curvata and 107. If desired, a microbe which is not normally oleaginous, such as Saccharomyces cereristae bakers yeast or Candida utilisg may be employed. Preferably the microbe has a large cell size , e.g. of 5 to 20 microns diameter. The lipid extending substance isa substance which is miscible with the microbial lipid and which is capable of entering the microbe by diffusion through the cell wall to extend or swell the lipid without cell rupture. Usually it will be a liquid at normal temperatures but it is possible to employ a substance which is a solid at normal temperatures provided that it can be liquified at slightly elevated temperatures which may be employed in the lipid extension process. Suitable lipid extending substances may be selected by the following tests. A. The substance may be mixed with an equal quantity of a microbe in the form of an aqueous slurry e.g. 1 g of substance and 1 g of microbe as a 20 aqueous slurry for 2 to 6 hours at 30 to 500C, the degree of mixing being sufficient to maintain homogeneity of the mixture e.gO by use of a standard laboratory hot plate magnetic stirrer at medium speed . The microbe is then harvested, suitably by centrifugation e.g. at about 2000 rpm for 15 minutes , and the harvested microbe is examined under a microscope. Suitable substances are shown by the presence of a large glistening globule in the cytoplasm. Usually the globule will occupy substantially all of the cytoplasm volume. B. The substance and microbe are mixed and the resultant Microbe is harvested, as in A, and then the microbe is analysed qualitatively and or quantitatively such as by treatment with a solvent for the substance e.g. methanol or methanol water e.g. 80 20 v v and analysis of the extract by a chromatographic technique such as gas liquid chromatography to detect the presence of the substance.C. The production of the mixture as in A is modified by including a known amount e.g. 0.02 g of a dye or other colourant in the substance, the harvested microbe is solvent extracted as in B and the extract is examined for colour such as by use of a spectrophotometer. If the dye is a leuco dye the extract should be treated with an acid prior to photometric examination.D. The production of the mixture as in A is modified by including a known amount e.g. 0.02 g of a dye in the substance, the harvested microbe is made into an aqueous suspension e.g. 2096 dry weight of microbe , the suspension is applied to the surface of a sheet of paper at a density of about 3 to 10 g.m2 e.g. by means of a doctor blade , the paper is air dried, and then the paper is subjected to localised pressure sufficient to rupture the microbe e.g. by use of a typewriter or manual writing instrument to see if the dye is emitted from the ruptured microbe. Suitably the dye may be a leuco dye, e.g.Crystal Violet Lactone, the microbe coated paper surface may be assembled in contact with the clay coated surface of another paper sheet, and the assembly subjected to the localised pressure. E. The substance is mixed with an equal quantity e.g. I ml of soybean oil e.g. by shaking in a testtube at room temperature . Suitable substancesare those which are seen to be miscible with soybean oil. The choice of lipid extending substance appears to be independent of the microbe to be treated. One group of substances consists of alcohols having more than three carbon atoms, especially aliphatic alcohols. The alcohols may have one or more hydroxyl groups. Examples of suitable alcohols are primary alcohols, especially those having 4 to 15 carbon atoms, e.g. n butanol, octanol, decanol and mixtures of longchain primary alcohols, mainly of 9 to 15 carbon atoms and octan 2 ol secondary alcohols e.g. iso butanol L tertiary alcohols e.g. tertiary butanol and glycols such as diethylene glycol o cH2CH2oH 2 . Another group of suitable substances consists of esters, especially those in which the alcohol component has more than two carbon atoms. The esters may be derived from acids having one or more carboxylic groups, for example 2 or 3 carboxylic groups, and from alcohols having one or more hydroxyl groups, for example 2 or 3.hydroxy groups. The acid and alcohol components may be aromatic or aliphatic. The acid component may be a hydroxycarboxylic acid. Examples of suitable esters are 2 ethylhexyl acetate, di 2 ethylhexyl adipate, di iso butyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, acetyl tributyl citrate, 2,2, 4 trimethyl l, 3 pentanediol isobutyrate, glyceryl triacetate triacetin and glyceryl tributyrate. Other suitable substances are some liquid hydrocarbons, for example aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, and hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as that available as Santosol 340 and the mixture of 4096 hydrogenated terphenyls available as HB 40 . Mixtures of lipid extending substances may be employed. In some cases, particularly when the substance is normally viscous, it may be desirable to thin or dilute the substance with a thinner such as acetone in order to facilitate the rate of absorption by the microbe and or the amount of substance absorbed.Substances which may benefit from such thinning include Santosol 340 , 2HB 40 and the commercially available mixtures of long chain primary alcohols. When a material is to be encapsulated in accordance with the invention, the particular lipidextending substance employed should be a solvent or dispersant for the material. The encapsulatable material might not be soluble in the microbial lipid however, solubility or compatibility with the lipid is preferred in order to enable as much as possible of the material to be encapsulated. The material may be a solid or a liquid. The encapsulation method is particularly suitable for producing encapsulated dyes, for example leuco dyes. Examples of suitable dyes are Sudan Green,Sudan Blue, Ethyl Eosin, Crystal Violet Lactone,Methylene Blue Lactone, Malachite Green Lactone andBenzoyl Leuco Methylene Blue. Other examples of encapsulatable materials are adhesives, adhesive components, pharmaceuticals e.g. stimulants such as pherones , flavours, rodenticides, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides and odiferous materials. Two or more reactive components may be encapsulated by separate cells, for example the reactive components of a two component adhesive. Conveniently the material is dissolved or micro dispersed in the lipid extending substance before contact with the microbe. Alternatively or additionally, the microbial lipid may be extended by the lipid extending substance and then the microbe may be treated with the encapsulatable material. In the latter case the material may be in the form of a solution or dispersion in further lipid extending substance or in a liquid which is miscible with the lipid extending substance. When the microbe is treated with the lipidextending substance, it should be intact, i.e. not lysed.Usually the treatment will comprise stirring the microbe in the lipid extending substance. The microbe may be in the form of a paste or slurry in water but a preferred technique comprises employing the microbe in a merely moist form. Conveniently the treatment may be performed at room temperature or at a slightly 0 elevated temperature, e.g. 40 to 50 C, which in some cases may increase microbial absorption of the substance.An elevated temperature may also increase the amount of encapsulatable material dissolved in the lipid extending substance. Usually the treatment time should be at least 2 hours, more usually at least 3 hours, to achieve optimum lipid extension. The amount of material encapsulated will depend on the extended lipid content of the microbe and on the solubility or dispersibility of the material therein. In order to attain encapsulation of a large quantity of material and to facilitate spreading or dispersal of the material if and when subsequently released from the microbial capsules, usually it is desirable for a large amount of lipidextending substance iDbe taken up by the microbe. In most cases it is not necessary for the amount of lipidextending substance employed to exceed the weight of the microbe. The encapsulated material may find application as a free standing product or adhered to a substrate.An example of a use of this invention is in the production of carbonless copy paper in which a coating of capsules containing a dye is adhered to one side of a sheet of paper, so that when the paper is subJected to pressure, e.g. by the type face of a typewriter or by a manual writing implement, the print will be duplicated on a paper sheet in contact with the coating. It is found when encapsulated dyes produced according to the present invention are applied iz the form of an aqueous suspension to the paper, the capsules adhere to the paper satisfactorily without the assistance of a binder or adhesive. The encapsulated material may be a material which produces a strong colour only when it reacts with another material, which may itself be encapsulated or may be in the form of a non encapsulated coating on the paper.For instance, the encapsulated material may be a leuco dye which is oxidisable by an acidic material such as an acidic clay to produce the desired print colour. It is preferred that one side of the paper sheet has a coating of the encapsulated material and the other side has an acidic clay coating, so that several sheets can be assembled with the clay coated face of one sheet in contact with the capsulecoated face of the adjacent sheet. Alternatively a mixed coating of capsules and clay may be employed. In some cases it may be desirable to employ more than one encapsulated dye in order to attain a desired colour. An alternative use of capsules of this invention is in conditions such that the release of the encapsulated material is delayed or prolonged by a slow or gradual lysis of the microbial cells. This could be advantageous for the administration of pharmaceuticals. The invention is illustated in the followingExamples. EXAMPLE I Lipomyces lipofer 5841 CBS was grown in the following medium g.1 1 glucose 40 ammonium tartrate 3 potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate 5 magnesium sulphate 7HzO 0.2 sodium chloride 0.1 calcium chloride 2H20 0.01 yeast extract powder 1 ferric chloride 0.002 The culture was grown in shake flasks using an 0 orbital incubator at 180 rpm and 28 C for 72 hours. The grown yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation 800 rpm for 5 minutes . The lipid content of the yeast was determined by the following procedure. Approximately 1.5 g of wet cells 0.2 g dry weight were weighed accurately and then hydrolysed with 2 ml of 6N HC1 in a boiling water bath for 2 hours. The hydrolysate was mixed with 30 ml of a 2 1 v v chloroform methanol mixture overnight.The resulting mixture was transferred to a separating funnel with 5 ml of 0.9, aqueous NaCI and the chloroform methanol layer was separated. The remaining mixture was washed twice with 10 ml of chloroform, and the washings were combined and evaporated to dryness in a pre weighed beaker. The beaker was then re weighed to determine the weight of the lipid, which was found to be about 30 by weight based on the dry weight of the yeast. Yeast produced from the above culture was made into a 15 w v slurry with distilled water, and a known weight of this aqueous slurry, containing 1 g dry weight of microbe, was mixed with 0.8 g of a 1 w v solution of crystal violet lactone in 2 ethylhexyl acetate The mixture was stirred for 6 hours at room temperature using a standard laboratory hot plate magnetic stirrer at medium speed to maintain homogeneity and the resulting microbial encapsulated dye was harvested by centrifugation. The harvested capsules were suspended in distilled water at a concentration of approximately 15 dry weight of cells in the water and the suspension was applied to the opposite side of claycoated paper using K Bar No.4 supplied by R.K. PrintCoat Instruments Ltd., U K.. The quantity of capsules applied to the paper was of the order of 6 10 gum . The paper was dried and tested for duplication ability in a standard office typewriter. It was found to function satisfactorily as a carbonless copy paper.

All of these liquids resulted in a satisfactory carbonless copy paper. EXAMPLE IV The procedure of Example I was repeated except that a 2 w v solution of crystal violet lactone in di 2 ethylhexyl adipate Lankroflex DOA was employed in place of the 1 2 ethylhexyl acetate solution. A satisfactory carbonless11 copy paper was produced. EXAMPLE V The procedure of Example I was repeated except that the time for which the aqueous microbial slurry was stirred with the solution of crystal violet lactone in 2 ethylhexyl acetate was varied. The times were 1,2,3,4,6 and 24 hours. The typewriter test showed that the product of the 3 hour incubation time was as good as the products of the higher incubation times. EXAMPLE VI l The procedure of Example I was repeated except that the concentration of crystal violet lactone in the 2 ethylhexyl acetate was 3 w v and the aqueous microbial slurry was stirred with the dye acetate solution for 3 hours at 600C. The typewriter test gave improved copies compared to that of Example I. EXAMPLE VII The procedure of Example VI was repeated except that the following quantities of dye acetate solution were employed individually, viz 1.0,s0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 g per g dry microbe. The typewriter copy produced by the employment of the 0.6 quantity was similar to the copies produced by employing the 0.8 and 1.0 quantities and was superior to that produced by employing the 0.4 quantity. EXAMPLE VIII Saccharomvces cerevisiae and Candida utilis 707 were individually cultivated under reduced nitrogen conditions and harvested, by the procedure of Example I. 1 g of each strain was made into a 1596 aqueous slurry and then mixed with 1 g of a 1 w v solution of crystal violet lactone in 2 ethylhexyl acetate. Each mixture was stirred as described in Example I for 3 hours and the resulting encapsulated dye was harvested by centrifugation. The capsules were applied to separate sheets of paper and subjected to a typewriter test as described in Example I. Both products gave a satisfactory print. The total lipid contents , by weight based on the dry weight of the microbe , measured as described in Example I, were 11.3, for the S.cerevisiae and 12.3, for the C.utilis 707.

The grown yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The total lipid content of the yeast, determined using the same procedure as in Example I, was found to be 35.12 by weight based on the dry weight of the yeast. A 20 aqueous slurry containing 1 g dry weight of the microbe was mixed with 0.8 g of a 2.5, w w solution of crystal violet lactone known asPergascript Blue I 2R and benzoyl leuco methylene blue known as Pergascript Blue S 4G 1.5 0.5 g mixture in octan 2 ol. The mixture was stirred for 2b hours 0 at 50 C using a laboratory hot plate magnetic stirrer at a medium speed to ensure homogeneity of the mixture. The resulting microbial encapsulated dye was harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The harvested capsules were suspended in distilled water at a concentration of approximately 2596 dry weight of capsules in water, and the suspension was applied to the opposite side of clay coated paper as described in Example I. The quantity of capsules applied to the paper was of the order of 3 6 g.m 2. The paper was dried and tested for duplication ability using a standard office typewriter. The copies produced were satisfactory. EXAMPLE X The procedure of Example IX was followed except that xylene was employed in place of the octan 2 ol.The typewriter test gave a satisfactory copy. EXAMPLE XI The procedure of Example IX was followed except that a 0.7 g of a 2, w w solution of the dye mixture in a 50 50 w w blend of acetone as thinner and a commercially available mixture of C12 to C15 long chain primary alcohols was employed in place of the octan 2 ol solution. The typewriter test gave improved copies compared to when the C12 to C15 alcohol mixture and acetone were employed individually. EXAMPLE XII The procedure of Example IX was followed except that HB 40 a commercially available mixture of 4096 hydrogenated terphenyls was employed in place of the octan 2 ol and the mixing time was 3 hours. The typewriter test have a positive print but not as good as that produced by Example I. This procedure w repeated except that a 50 50 w w blend of acetone and HB 40 was employed in place of the HB 40 . The typewriter test gave a better copy than when KB 40 alone was employed. EXAMPLE XIII The procedure of Example XII was repeated except that Santosol 340 a commercially available mixture of hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons was employed in place of the HB 40 . The typewriter test gave similar results as for Example XII, the acetone Santosol blend giving better copies than Santosol alone. EXAMPLE XIV A 20, aqueous slurry containing 1 g dry weight of the microbe produced according to Example IX was mixed with 0.8 g of 2 ethylhexyl acetate by medium stirring using a laboratory hot plate magnetic stirrer for 1 hours at 500C and the resulting lipid extended microbe was harvested by centrifugation. Microscopic examination showed a large glistening globule occupying the whole of the cytoplasm of the yeast cell. A 2096 aqueous slurry containing 1 g dry weight of the lipid extended microbe was mixed with 0.8 g of a 2 w v solution of Leucodye in propanol immiscible with soybean oil but miscible with 2 ethylhexyl acetate by medium stirring using a laboratory hot plate magnetic stirrer for 2 hours at 500 C and the resulting microbe was harvested by centrifugation. The typewriter test gave a satisfactory copy. A parallel procedure was carried out except that the microbe was not treated with 2 ethylhexyl acetate. The typewriter test gave a poorer copy than when 2 ethylhexyl acetate was employed. EXAMPLE XV A 20, aqueous slurry containing 3 g dry weight of the yeast prepared as described in Example I was mixed with 3 g of clove oil and 0.5 ml of 2 ethylhexyl acetate by medium stirring using a laboratory hot plate magnetic stirrer for 3 hours at 500C. The microbial product was harvested by centrifugation and oven dried at 700C. When the resulting microbe was crushed, a distinct odour of clove oil was noticed.
