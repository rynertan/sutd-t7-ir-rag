# A circuit for handling conversation data in a distributed processing telex exchange.

## Abstract
A circuit for the systematic handling of conversation data from a calling party to a called party for use in a distributed processing telex exchange is disclosed. The customer termi nations connected to the exchange are divided into a pre determined number of groups of terminations having a pre determined number of terminations in each group. Associ ated with each group of terminations is a frame memory 302, 316 which has memory capacity for storing a single bit of conversation data from every termination connected to the exchange. Associated with each frame memory is a vector memory 376, 378 which has a memory location associated with each termination in a group. Each vector memory loca tion contains a frame memory address that addresses the location in frame memory containing the conversation data to be forwarded down to the termination associated with the current vector memory address. In addition, each vector memory location contains an active bit which is included with the conversation data forwarded to the called party termina tion to indicate that a call is in progress for that termination.
