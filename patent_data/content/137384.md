# Gap energizing system for TW Electroerosion 1111111 .

## Abstract
A gap energizing system for TW electroerosion, in which a fluid delivery assembly 101, 201 has an elongate internal fluid passage longitudinally traversed by a straight line path for a traveling wire electrode 2 traversing a workpiece 1 while defining a machining gap G therewith. The passage is supplied with a machining fluid from an external fluid source and has at its end a nozzle outlet 106, 206 for discharging the supplied fluid as an envelop flow surrounding the eletrode 2 towards the workpiece 1 and into the machin ing gap G . Disposed in the internal passage are a precision guide member 117, 217 and an electrode contact means 118, 218, 119, 219 . A workpiece contact means 124, 224 is movably mounted on the fluid delivery assembly so as to surround the electrode 2 passing through the nozzle outlet 106, 206 and operably arranged for movement parallel to the straight line electrode travel path towards the workpiece 1 to make contact therewith for energizing the machining gap G , only upon development of a fluid pressure in the fluid passage representing delivery of the machining fluid into the machining gap G .
