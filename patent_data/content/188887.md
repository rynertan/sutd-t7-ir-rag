## Description
This invention relates to cyclopropane containing tertiary amines useful as fungicides, to a process for preparing them, to fungicidal compositions containing them, and to methods of using them to combat fungi, especially fungal infections in plants. There are described in AT B 273066 certain phenylcyclopropane derivatives and their salts and these, depending on the substituents chosen, possess a wide range of pharmacological properties including antimycotic effects. There is no guidance, however, as to which substituents will produce such anti mycotic effects. The invention provides a method of combating plant fungi which comprises applying to a plant, to seed of a plant, or to the locus of a plant or seed a compound having the general formula I or a stereoisomer or acid addition salt thereof, wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶, which may be the same or different, represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a halogen atom R⁷ and R⁸, which may be the same or different, represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or together form a ring which may contain oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur as an additional heteroatom, and which ring may be optionally substituted with one or more C₁ ₄ alkyl groups, or a phenyl or an hydroxyalkyl group X and Y which may be the same or different, represent a hydrogen or a halogen atom, or an alkyl group containing from 1 to 6 carbons atoms, a cycloalkyl group containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkenyl or alkynyl group each containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenyl group, a benzyl group, an alkoxy group containing form 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a phenoxy group, a benzyloxy group, or a group wherein R⁹, R¹⁰ and R¹¹, which may be the same or different, represent an alkyl group containing up to 4 carbon atoms, an aalkenyl or alkynyl group each containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group. The compounds used in the invention are generally obtained in the form of mixtures of geometric isomers. However, these and other mixtures of optical isomers can be separated into individual isomers by methods in the art and such isomers consititute a part of the present invention. When R⁷ and R⁸, together with the adjacent N atom, represent a heterocyclic ring this may be, for example, a piperidine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, pyrrolidine or piperazine ring and any of these rings may bear substituents such as one or more C₁ ₄ alkyl groups or a phenyl group, or an hydroxyalkyl group. The alkyl and alkoxy groups, especially for X and Y, but also for R¹ to R⁸ and R⁹ to R¹¹ when alkyl, may be straight or branched chain groups having 1 to 6 for X and Y , and 1 to 4, for R¹ to R¹¹ carbon atoms examples are methyl, ethyl, propyl The halogen atoms which R¹ to R⁶ and X and Y may represent may be fluorine, chlorine, or bromine.

The ¹H nmr chemical shifts of parts of these structures have been recorded in order to identify the various compounds. The ¹³C nmr chemical shifts for compounds of Formula I where R¹ R⁶ equals hydrogen, is at the left hand side of the cyclopropane ring in relation to the moiety which is CH₂ since R³ and R⁴ are both H at the right hand side of the cyclopropane ring i.e. these are trans to each other. Compounds of general formula I can be prepared by treatment of a compound of general formula II wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵, R⁶, X, and Y are as defined above and Z is a leaving group such as chlorine, bromine, mesylate or tosylate, with an amine of general formula III wherein R⁷ and R⁸ are as defined above, in the presence of a convenient solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran, or, preferably, in the absence of a solvent at a temperature of 20 100 C. The compounds II can be prepared by treating an alcohol of general formula IV wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴, R⁵, R⁶, X, and Y are as defined above with the usual halogenating agents eg. phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, or phosphorus oxychloride when Z chlorine and phosphorus tribromide, phosphorus pentabromide, or phosphorus oxybromide when Z bromine , or mesyl chloride in pyridine or triethylamine when Z mesylate, or tosyl chloride in pyridine or triethylamine when Z tosylate.

The alcohols IV , wherein R³ R⁴ alkyl, can be prepared by treating the above ester V with an excess of alkyl magnesium halide or an excess of alkyl lithium in a convenient solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. The esters V can be prepared by reacting the cinnamic esters of general formula VI wherein R, R⁵ and R⁶, X, and Y are as defined above with a phosphorane of general formula VII wherein R¹ and R² are defined above in a convenient solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. In an alternative process the esters of general formula V wherein R⁵ hydrogen, can be prepared by adding ethyl diazoacetate to the olefin of general formula VIII The compounds of general formula I , where R³ R⁴ hydrogen, can also be prepared by treating an amide of general formula IX wherein R¹, R², R⁵, R⁶, R⁷, R⁸, X, and Y are as defined above with a reducing agent usually lithium aluminium hydride in a convenient solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. The amides of general formula IX can be prepared by reacting an acid chloride of general formula X wherein R¹, R², R⁵, R⁶, X, and Y are as defined above, with an amine of general formula III in a convenient solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.

The compounds VI , VIII , and XII can be prepared by standard methods set out in the literature. The salts of compounds of the general formula I can be prepared from the latter by known methods. The compounds, salts and metal comlexes are active fungicides, particularly against the diseases Some of the compounds have also shown a broad range of activities against fungi The compounds can move acropetally in the plant tissue. Moreover, the compounds can be volatile enough to be active in the vapour phase against fungi on the plant. They may also be useful as industrial as opposed to agricultural fungicides, e.g. in the prevention of fungal attack on wood, hides, leather and especially paint films. The compounds may be used as such for fungicidal purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides a fungicidal composition comprising a compound of general formula I as hereinbefore defined, or a salt, metal complex, ether or ester thereof and, optionally, a carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combating fungi, which comprises applying to a plant, to seed of a plant, or to the locus of the plant or seed, a compound, or salt, metal complex, ether or ester thereof, as hereinbefore defined. The compounds, salts, metal complexes, ethers and esters can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, or they can be applied also to bushes and trees, to seeds or to other medium in which plants, bushes or trees are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour or as slow release granules. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted or to the soil generally, to paddy water or to hydroponic culture systems. The invention compounds may also be injected into plants or trees and they may also be sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum, Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler. Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers eg. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, eg. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a microencapsulated form. They may also be formulated in biodegradable polymeric formulations to obtain a slow, controlled release of the active substance. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers eg. nitrogen , potassium or phosphorus containing fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising the compound of general formula I or a salt or metal complex thereof. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants eg. wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s or which are spray formulations of the kind suitable for use in electrodynamic spraying techniques. The foregoing agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , and the concentrate is to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional and electrodynamic spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s . These concentrates suitably contain organic acids eg. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecyl benzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, eg. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal activity or compounds having plant growth regulating, herbicidal or insecticidal activity.
