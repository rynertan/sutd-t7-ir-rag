# Self contained gas powered surgical stapler.

## Abstract
A surgical stapler 10 powered by a relatively low pressu re gas supply contained in the stapler 10 . The stapler 10 has a mechanical linkage 70 between the pneumatic actuator 60 and the staple driver with a differential mechanical advantage to match the substantially constant force provided by the pneumatic actuator 60 to the different forces required to first advance and then form the staple. This mechanical linkage 70 allows use of a relatively small low pressure actuator 60 and also substantially increases the efficiency with which the gas supply is utilized.
