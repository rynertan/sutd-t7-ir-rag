# Method and apparatus for determining the hydrogen content of a gas.

## Abstract
A method for determining the hydrogen content of a persons expiratory air comprising the following steps leading the air through a sample holder 4 sampling the air by closing the outlet 5 and inlet 1 of the sample holder, and determining the hydrogen content by driving slowly at a fixed rate and overpressure the gas sample through the detector 11 . The detector used is sensitive for gas and smoke and determines the hydrogen content by means of diffusion. Before a gas sample is passed through the detector, during a predetermined minimum time period air is passed through the sample holder and detector. During the time expiratory air is leaded through the sample holder, air is leaded through the detector at a fixed rate.
