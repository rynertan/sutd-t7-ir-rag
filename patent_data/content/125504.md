# Bipolar transistor MOS transistor hybrid semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A high speed and low power consumption semiconduc tor integrated circuit device has a plurality of internal circuits 302, 303 each including circuit elements for performing a desired circuit operation, a plurality of input circuits 301 for receiving external input signals and supplying the signals to the internal circuits and a plurality of output circuits 301 for receiving the output signals from the internal circuits and supplying signals to an external. Each of the internal circuits is primarily constructed by bipolar transistors and MOS transistors, and at least one of each of the input circuits and each of the output circuits is primarily constructed by bipolar transistors.
