# Impact resistant, high softening maleic anhydride copolymers and a process for preparing thereof.

## Abstract
High softening polymeric compositions having good impact resistance are composed of polymerized maleic anhydride, an alpha olefin such as diisobutylene, optionally styrene and a preformed diene rubber such as a styrene butadiene rubber and are prepared by polymerizing maleic anhydride, an alpha olefin and, optionally, styrene in the presence of a rubber.
