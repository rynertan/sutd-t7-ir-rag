# Polyester of 6 hydroxy 4 naphthoic acid, 4 hydroxy benzoic acid, 1 4 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, and aromatic diol capable of readily undergoing melt processing to form articles possessing high impact properties.

## Abstract
A novel polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit an optically anisotropic melt phase which enables it readily to undergo melt processing to form quality moulded articles possessing unusually high impact properties, etc. The polyester of the present invention contains recurring 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl, 4 oxybenzoyl and 1,4 dicarboxy cyclohexane moieties in addition to a moiety derived from an aromatic diol in the proportions indicated. The hydrogen atoms present upon the aromatic rings optionally may be at least partially substituted as described . The polyester is capable of forming the desired anisotropic melt at a tempera ture below approximately 350 C., and in a particularly preferred embodiment at a temperature below approximate ly 320 C.
