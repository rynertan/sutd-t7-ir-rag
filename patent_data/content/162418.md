# Semiconductor memory test equipment.

## Abstract
The equipment of the present invention is a semiconductor tester in which an address is generated by a test pattern generator 101 in synchronism with an operating clock from a timing generator 102 , the address to applied to a memory 112 under test and a check is made to determine if the power source current to the memory under test is larger than a predetermined value. A current value deciding circuit 220 is provided, by which the power source current value is detected, and it is decided by a comparator whether the detected current value is greater than the predetermined value or not. The decision result is output at the timing of an output timing signal from the timing generator.
