## Description
This invention relates to improvements in exterior finishing systems and exterior insulation systems forbuildings, and also to improvements in shaft wall assemblies for buildings. More particularly, this inventionprovides an improved structural component for use as a support surface in an exterior finishing system,including an exterior insulation system sometimes referred to herein for convenience as ElSystem . Inaddition, the present invention encompasses improvements in hollow shaft wall assemblies, for example,those used in constructing elevator shafts and stairwells. This invention will be described initially in connection with its use in ElSystems, but, as will beexplained hereinafter, its use has wider applicability. ElSystems are presently being used more and more widely to insulate existing buildings and buildingsunder construction including industrial, commercial, municipal, institutional, and residential buildings. Installationof a typical ElSystem in new construction generally involves the following sequential steps A constructing a frame for support of the outside wall of a building B affixing to the frame structural panelsto provide a smooth continuous surface for the support of other of the components of the ElSystem C affixing to the support surface panels of insulation and D affixing to the panels of insulation a mesh likematerial which in turn is covered with an exterior finishing material having weathering and aestheticproperties. Such systems are designed to be not only highly insulative in character and attractive inappearance, but also weather resistant. ElSystems can be used to advantage to conserve energy used forheating and to conserve energy used for air conditioning. ElSystems have inherent advantages over interior insulating systems and, in addition, they can be usedto better advantage than interior insulating systems in many applications. For example, the range of temperature variation in structural components comprising the walls of abuilding insulated from the outside is less than that for such components in a building which is insulatedfrom the inside. Accordingly, such structural components when insulated from the outside are subjected tosignificantly lower amounts of stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction than those insulatedfrom the inside. This is particularly advantageous in applications where the structural components comprisematerials having markedly different coefficients of expansion, as is often the case. In addition, the interiorspace in a building having an ElSystem tends to have a more uniform temperature and be less drafty thanthat of a building insulated from the inside. Certain buildings are not capable of being insulated from the interior except that valuable inside spaceis lost to the system. The installation of an EISystem does not disturb the inside space of the building. An ElSystem can be used also to modernize or otherwise renovate the exterior of a building in need ofrenovation. Various of the ElSystems which are commercially available give the architect a wide range ofaesthetically pleasing designs from which to choose. In addition, the cost of installing an ElSystem isrelatively low when there is taken into account both the costs of other systems and the improved thermalefficiencies that can be realized. The relatively light weight of both the insulation and the exterior finish in anElSystem is particularly advantageous in new construction because of reduced foundation requirements. There are, however, problems associated with the design and or installation of EISystems. As will bediscussed in detail below, various of the problems stem from the type of material which is used as thesupporting member for the insulating and exterior finishing materials of the system. The present inventioninvolves improvements in such supporting member. As mentioned above, a typical ElSystem includes a supporting member to which there is affixedinsulating material, which in turn is covered with an exterior finishing material. An exemplary ElSystemincludes a wood or metal frame which is mechanically held in place by nails or screws to appropriatestructural members of the building, with panels of the supporting member in turn mechanically affixed bynails or screws to the frame. The supporting member, which typically consists of a smooth continuoussurface comprising individual panels of material positioned in abutting relationship, must be strong enoughto carry the weight of the components which overlie it, including the insulating and exterior finishingmaterials. Although low density, light weight insulating panels of expanded polystyrene are used widely insuch systems, the exterior finishing material is generally a much denser and heavier weight material, forexample, an acrylic resin cement coating that may include decorative aggregate embedded therein. Certain of the commercialized ElSystems include the use of panels of a Portland cement basedcomposition as the structural member for the support of the overlying panels of insulation and exteriorfinishing material. It is believed that such cement based panels are described in US A 3,284,980 whichdiscloses a building panel comprising a core consisting of a mixture of hydraulic cement and light weightaggregate for example, perlite sandwiched between sheets of fibrous material for example, woven glassfiber screen , which are adhered to the faces of the core by separate layers of bonding material containing at least 50 hydraulic cement. Although the cores of such panels include a light weight aggregate, thepanels are nevertheless relatively heavy. For example, a panel 91.4 X 121.9 cm 3 X 4 and 1.11 cm 7 16 in thickness weighs about 18.4 Kg 40 1 2 pounds . The handling and installation of such panels leadto the consumption of relatively large amounts of energy. This is a burden to workmen and makestransportation of the panels relatively costly. A material which is used more widely in ElSystems than the aforementioned cement board is gypsumboard, that is, panels comprising a core of set gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate sandwiched betweenpaper cover sheets. The particular type of gypsum board that is recommended for use in ElSystems isknown as gypsum sheathing which is gypsum board designed for use on the exterior of buildings where itserves as an underlying surface which is covered with such materials as aluminum, wood siding, Portlandcement stucco and, in the case of an ElSystem, with insulating and exterior finishing materials. Conventionalgypsum sheathing, as opposed to conventional gypsum wallboard for use in the interior of a building,includes a set gypsum core which contains one or more additives which improve the water resistance of theset core. The gypsum core of commercially available wallboard can absorb as much as 40 50 wt. waterwhen immersed therein at a temperature of 21.1 C 70 F for about 2 hours. As the absorption of watertends to substantially reduce the strength of the core, materials which reduce the tendency of the core toabsorb water are included therein. In addition, sheathing has water repellant paper cover sheets which shedwater. This is temporary protection for the sheathing before it is installed and before it is covered with theexterior finishing material. Gypsum sheathing has many desirable characteristics which make it suitable for use in an ElSystem.For example, such sheathing has relatively good fire resistant properties, it is relatively light in weight, it hassatisfactory water resistant properties and it can be mechanically affixed in convenient fashion to a metal orwooden frame which underlies the sheathing. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, concerns have been expressed respecting the use of suchgypsum sheathing in ElSystems. By way of background, it is noted that it is conventional in the industry toaffix panels of insulating material to the underlying support of gypsum sheathing by the use of an adhesivematerial and, in turn, to affix by the use of adhesive materials each of the plies which overlie the panels ofinsulation. Except for the use of mechanical fastening means in the construction of the frame of the buildingand in affixing the gypsum sheathing to the frame, all of the components of the ElSystem are in effectglued together. A general discussion of such ElSystems, while not explicitly disclosing the use of gypsum board as thesupport panels is to be found in Schweikert, H Wärmedämmverbundsysteme , Deutsche Bauzeitschrift, Tests designed to evaluate the cohesive strength of and the adhesive strengths between the variouscomponents comprising the ElSystem have shown that initial failure pulling apart of the system occurs notin any of the adhesive layers, but in the paper cover sheet of the gypsum sheathing. Such cover sheetconsists of multi ply paper, for example, as many as 7 layers of paper adhered together in a form thatappears to the eye to be a monolithic sheet of paper. Accordingly, the cohesive strength of the paper canbe characterized as the weak portion of the system. Another concern respecting the use of gypsum sheathing in ElSystems of the aforementioned type isthat water leakage through the system can lead to the deterioration of the bond between the paper coversheet and the gypsum core. Although the system is designed to be waterproof, there are circumstanceswhere defects in one or more plies of the system and or unusually severe environmental conditions are thecause of water seepage. It should be appreciated that deterioration of this bond can lead to cracking of theexterior finish, and possibly even collapse of portions of the system as the component which is adhered tothe paper cover sheet pulls apart. In an effort to overcome the aforementioned type problems, it has been proposed to affix the insulating material to the underlying gypsum sheathing by the use of mechanical fasteners which extend through the insulating material, the core of the gypsum sheathing and into the frame. This approach to the problem has the disadvantage that the work time involved in installing the system is increased significantly inasmuch as it is much more time consuming to install fasterners than to apply an adhesive. Another shortcoming of the fasterner approach is that the fasteners provide paths for the flow of water which may penetrate the system and weaken the bond between the paper cover sheet and gypsum core, as mentioned above. Irrespective of how the insulating material is affixed to the underlying gypsum sheathing, there is another problem connected with the use of sheathing in ElSystems. Because of its susceptibility to degradation by water, care must be taken to protect the sheathing from rain and other moisture conditons which may be encountered as the sheathing is stored at the job site awaiting use and during installation. Taking such protective precautions consumes time, causes inconvenience, and sometimes causes delays in installation of the system all of which tend to increased costs. Although gypsum sheathing has a water repellant paper surface which provides some limited protection against water degradation, this type of surface forms a relatively poor bond with water based adhesives which are used to adhere to the surface other components of the EISystem. German Utility model No. 78 06 114 is directed to structural panels including a gypsum core having a glass fiber mantle or facing. The glass mantle contains a glass fiber fabric or interlaid scrim with a chopped strand mat adhered thereto to form a composite. The composite mat is free of gypsum on its surface, once it is applied to the core, by a denser portion of the chopped strand mat which acts as a barrier to penetrating gypsum slurry. German laid open patent specification No. 2 008 744 discloses a gypsum wallboard covered with a fiber glass sheath. At least the lower fiber glass sheath is provided with a removable paper coating on its outer side. This measure is suggested to avoid possible soiling of the belt conveyor by gypsum slurry during manufacturing. The present invention is directed to use in EISystems of a support member comprising an improvedgypsum based structural component which is modified in a manner such that problems of the typeassociated with the use of conventional gypsum sheathing are either overcome or alleviated significantly. In accordance with the present invention as defined in the appended respective claims, there is provided an improved structural support elementcomprising a fibrous mat faced gypsum support surface for use in an exterior finishing system, includingexterior insulating systems, for buildings. The invention also includes an exterior insulation system for a building which includes a support surfacecomprising gypsum board according to the invention facing away from said building, insulating materialhaving an inner surface and an outer surface, the inner surface of which is adhered to said support surfaceby an adhesive material, the insulating material being substantially free of channels penetrating therethroughand between said inner and outer surfaces, and exterior finishing material overlying the outer surfaceof said insulating material. Preferably, the fibrous mat faced gypsum board according to the invention comprises a gypsum corehaving one or more additives therein which improve the water resistance of the core. As will be seen from examples reported below,a structural member comprising a water resistant gypsum core faced with glass mat, which itself ishydrophobic, has outstanding weathering characteristics. As will be described below, the glass fiber mat surface which is free of set gypsum in the gypsumboard according to the invention provides an excellent substrate to which overlying panels of insulation canbe adhered. In one embodiment of the gypsum board of the invention, the outer surface of the other mat of thegypsum board is also substantially free of set gypsum, with set gypsum of the core penetrating but part wayinto the thickness of both the mats. As will be described below, there are manufacturing advantageswhich accompany the production of gypsum board of such embodiment. In another embodiment of the gypsum board of the present invention, the set gypsum of the corepenetrates substantially through the thickness of the other mat over substantial area portions thereof inamounts which are sufficient to coat glass fibers of the mat with a thin film of set gypsum, but not sufficientto form a smooth, continuous coating of set gypsum. This embodiment in which significant portionsof theouter surface of the mat have set gypsum thereon provides a protective surface in a two board package inwhich the boards are packed together with the gypsum free surfaces in face to face relationship and withthe gypsum covered faces being exposed. More particularly, this preferred form of board comprises a setgypsum core sandwiched between two adhering sheets of porous glass mat of predetermined thickness,each of said mats having an inner and outer surface and comprising randomly distributed glass fibersbonded by an adhesive material, the inner surface of each of said mate being adhered to said gypsumcore, and with set gypsum of the core at one surface thereof penetrating substantially through the thicknessof one of said mats over substantial area portions thereof and coating substantial area portions of the outersurface thereof and with set gypsum of the core at the other surface thereof penetrating but part way intothe thickness of the other of said mats, the outer surface of the other of said mats being substantially free ofset gypsum. Still another aspect of the present invention comprises a process as defined in the appended process claim for making the aforementionedembodiments of gypsum board, that is, the embodiment in which both outer surfaces of the mats aresubstantially free of set gypsum and the embodiment in which the outer surface of one of the mats issubstantially free of set gypsum and that of the other mat has set gypsum thereon. The process includesknown steps used heretofore in manufacturing in continuous fashion conventional wallboard and knownglassfiber mat faced gypsum board, but differs therefrom in that the viscosity of the aqueous gypsum slurryfrom which the board core is made is controlled in a manner such that the slurry penetrates into the mats tothe extent needed to achieve the desired result. In forming gypsum board in which both of the outer mat surfaces are substantially gypsum free, theviscosity of the slurry is maintained at a value such that portions of said slurry penetrate but part waythrough the thickness of each of said underlying and overlying mats and the panel like shape of slurry ismaintained as the calcined gypsum sets to form a set gypsum core having adhered to its surfaces theunderlying and overlying fiber glass mats. In forming the gypsum coated gypsum free form of glass fiber faced board, the viscosity of the slurry ismaintained at a value such that portions of said slurry penetrate substantially through the thickness of saidunderlying mat over substantial area portions thereof to coat substantial area portions of the outer surfaceand at a value such that portions of said slurry penetrate but part way into the thickness of said overlyingmat. There are numerous advantages which flow from the use of the present invention. An ElSystem whichincludes a fibrous mat faced gypsum support surface that has affixed thereto insulating material byadhesive only, that is, without fastening means which extend through the insulating material, has highertensile or cohesive strength than a like system which includes conventional paper faced gypsum board.Testing of systems of this invention which include insulation in the form of expanded polystyrene panelshas shown that initial failure is experienced by a pulling apart of the expanded polystyrene panel, thusevidencing improvement in strength relative to conventional systems where initial failure is experienced inthe paper plies of the gypsum support member. The fibrous mat faced surface of the gypsum supportmember is water resistant in contrast to conventional paper cover sheets of gypsum board which can soakup water. This improved water resistance gives the applicator greater flexibility in selecting adhesives thatcan be used to adhere insulation directly to the mat faced surface of the gypsum support element asadverse affects are not encountered by the use of water based adhesives. The fibrous mat faced surface ofthe gypsum support element is nailable , and accordingly, it can be secured readily to an underlyingframe or other substrate by nailing. In comparison to various of the commercially available systems, theimproved support surface of the present invention has improved rigidity and strength uniformity in both thelength and width dimensions of the system. Unlike conventional paper cover sheets, the fibrous mat doesnot expand or contract during the manufacture of the product this reduces cockle and leads to uniformity ofdimensions. The preferred embodiment of the invention which includes the use of a water resistant coreprovides a substantially improved weather resistant product which better resists degradation both within andoutside of the system. In the accompanying drawings, The essential components of an ElSystem comprise insulating material which is sandwiched betweenan underlying support surface and an exterior finishing material which can be an integral part of theinsulating material, but which is usually applied to the insulating material at the site of installation. From oneElSystem to the next, there exist variations in structural details and components. For example, although theexterior finishing material may be affixed directly to the insulating material, various systems include areinforcing component sandwiched between the exterior finishing material and the insulating material. Thereinforcing component comprises generally one or more plies of fiber glass reinforcing fabric or mesh whichis adhered by suitable mastic to the surface of the insulating material. In some systems, the support surfaceis affixed to a wooden frame attached to the exterior surface of the outside wall of a building, whereas inother systems a metal frame is used. In certain applications, the support surface may be affixed directly tothe exterior surface of an outside wall, for example, one comprising cinder blocks or concrete blocks. Innew construction, the support surface is typically affixed directly to the frame of the building. The adhesiveor mastic for adhering together components of the system tends to vary from one system to the next, andtypically comprises specially formulated proprietary compositions. The improved support surface of thepresent invention can be used satisfactorily and to good advantage in ElSystems which include overlyingplies of insulating and exterior finishing materials, and other optional components. Presently, the most popularly used insulating material in ElSystems is expanded or foamed polystyrene,a material which has good moisture resistant properties. Although it has desirably low water vaportransmission, it is not a vapor barrier, but instead is capable of breathing. Rigid panels of expandedpolystyrene are used most widely in ElSystems. Such panels have satisfactory compressive strength andresilience and are presently available in thicknesses ranging from 1.27 to 15.2 cm 1 2 to 6 inches , widthsfrom 15.2 to 121.9 cm 6 to 48 inches and lengths ranging from 121.9 to 487.7 cm 4 feet to 16 feet . Onecommercially available system utilizes rigid, expanded polystyrene panels which are 61.0 X 121.9 X 2.54cm 2 X 4 X 1 . Other thermal insulating materials can be used in ElSystems also. Examples of such materials includeextruded polystyrene, polyurethane, isocyanurate, cement based insulating plasters, and phenolic foam.Insulating materials generally have low thermal conducting and low density. As mentioned above, various ElSystems include a reinforcing component, for example, in cloth form,sandwiched between the insulating material and the exterior finishing material. Glass cloth is most widelyused at the Present tide to reinforce the system, that is, to improve the impact strength of the system. Theparticular type or types of glass cloth used and the number of plies thereof which are used depend on theimpact resistance which is desired. Examples of reinforcing cloth or fabric which can be used in the systemare woven glass, glass fiber skrim and glass fiber mesh. Installation of the reinforcing fabric generallyinvolves applying a suitable adhesive to the surface of the insulating material and then applying the fabricthereto. Additional plies of fabric can be applied if desired. A cement acrylic resin is an example of anadhesive that can be used. The exterior finishing material can be affixed directly to the insulating material or to an intermediatesurface such as, for example, the surface of a reinforcing member as described above. The exteriorfinishing material has weathering characteristics and is preferably appealing in appearance. Presently, themost widely used exterior finish is an acrylic resin based composition which is available in a paste typeform which is spread or troweled on the underlying substrate. One type of such composition can bedescribed as a ready mixed synthetic resin plaster. After application, the resin sets to form a tough,weather resistant solid material which adheres tightly to the underlying substrate. Such resin compositionsare available commercially in a variety of colors. They include optionally aggregate which can vary in size.This allows the applicator to choose a particular composition which permits him to apply a finish that canvary in texture from fine to coarse. Finishes which have a stucco like appearance are popular. Small stonesof various colors can be embedded in the composition for decorative purposes. Examples of other materials that can be used as an exterior finish are Portland cement stucco including,for example, sand and larger aggregate. The exterior finish can vary in thickness over a wide range, with a thickness of about 0.159 to 0.635 cm 1 16 to 1 4 being exemplary. Turning now to a description of the improved gypsum board for use as support member in exteriorsystems of the present invention, it comprises a set gypsum core faced with a fibrous mat. The gypsumcore is basically of the type used in those gypsum structural products which are known as gypsumwallboard, dry wall, gypsum board and gypsum sheathing. The core of such a product is formed by mixing water with powdered anhydrous calcium sulfate or calcium sulfate hemihydrate CaSO The composition from which the set gypsum core is made can include optional constituents, including,for example, those included conventionally in gypsum sheathing. Examples of such constituents include setaccelerators, foaming agents, and dispersing agents. As will be described in more detail below, a preferredgypsum core for use in the present invention includes one or more additives which improve the waterresistant properties of the core. The surface of the core to which the insulating material of tile system is affixed is faced with a fibrousmat,. The fibrous mat should be sufficiently porous to permit water in the aqueous gypsum slurry fromwhich the gypsum core is made to evaporate therethrough. As described in detail below, the gypsumsupport element for use in the present invention can be made efficiently by forming an aqueous gypsumslurry which contains excess water and placing thereon the fibrous mat. aided by healing, excess waterevaporates through the porous mat as the calcined gypsum sets. The fibrous mat comprises material which is capable of forming a strong bond with the set gypsumcomprising the core of the support surface. Examples of such materials include a mineral type materialsuch as glass fibers and synthetic resin fibers. The mat can comprise continuous or discrete strands orfibers. Nonwoven mats such as chopped strand mat and continuousstrand mat can be used satisfactorily. The strands of such matsare bonded together by suitable adhesive. The mat can range in thickness, for example, from about 0.038to 0.102 cm 15 to 40 mils , with a thickness of about 0.063 to 0.089 cm 25 to 35 mils being preferred.The aforementioned fibrous mats are known and are commercially available in many forms. The preferred fibrous mat is a fiber glass mat comprising fiberglass filaments orientated in randompattern and bound together with a resin binder. Fiber glass mats of this type are commercially available, forexample, those sold under the trademark DURA GLASS by Manville Building Materials Corporation andthose sold by ELK Corporation as BUR or shingle mat. Although improvements in an ElSystem can be realized by the use of a gypsum core which has butone of its surfaces faced with fibrous mat as described herein, it is preferred that both surfaces of the corebe faced with substantially the same fibrous material. If the surfaces of the core are faced with materialsthat have different coefficients of expansion, the core tends to warp. Fibrous mat faced gypsum board andmethods for making the same are known, for example, as described in CA A 993,779 and US A 3,993,822. As mentioned above, the preferred form of the fibrous mat faced gypsum support surface comprises agypsum core which has water resistant properties. The preferred means for impartingwater resistantproperties to the gypsum core is to include in the gypsum composition from which the core is made one ormore additives which improve the ability of the set gypsum composition to resist being degraded by water,for example, to resist dissolution. In preferred form, the water resistance of the core is such that it absorbsless than 5 percent water when tested in accordance with ASTM method C 473 with only the edgesexposed. The fibrous mat for use in the present invention has substantially better water resistant properties thanthe conventional paper facing of gypsum wallboard or sheathing. Nevertheless, evaluations have shown thatthe bond between the fibrous mat and gypsum core can deteriorate relatively quickly under the influence ofwater. For example, samples exposed to the weather showed loosening at the glass fiber facing within oneto two months. In contrast, evaluations of water resistant gypsum core faced with fibrous mat in accordancewith the present invention have shown the bond between the mat and core resists being degraded by waterfor indefinite periods of time. Examples of materials which have been reported as being effective for improving the water resistantproperties of gypsum products are the following poly vinyl alcohol , with or without a minor amount ofpoly vinyl acetate metallic resinates wax or asphalt or mixtures thereof a mixture of wax and or asphaltand also cornflower and potassium permanganate water insoluble thermoplastic organic materials such aspetroleum and natural asphalt, coal tar, and thermoplastic synthetic resins such as poly vinyl acetate , poly vinylchloride and a copolymer of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride and acrylic resins a mixture of metalrosin soap, a water soluble alkaline earth metal salt, and residual fuel oil a mixture of petroleum wax in theform of an emulsion and either residual fuel oil, pine tar or coal tar a mixture comprising residual fuel oiland rosin aromatic isocyanates and diisocyanates organohydrogenpolysiloxanes a wax asphalt emulsionwith or without such materials as potassium sulfate, alkali and alkaline earth aluminates, and Portlandcement a wax asphalt emulsion prepared by adding to a blend of molten wax and asphalt an oil soluble,water dispersible emulsifying agent, and admixing the aforementioned with a solution of casein which contains, as a dispersing agent, an alkali sulfonate of a polyarylmethylene condensation product A preferred material for use in improving the water resistant properties of the gypsum core compriseswax asphalt emulsion, species of which are available commercially. The wax portion of the emulsion ispreferably a paraffin or microcrystalline wax, but other waxes can be used also. The asphalt in generalshould have a softening point of about 46 C 115 F , determined by the ring and ball method. The totalamount of wax and asphalt in the aqueous emulsion will generally comprise about 50 to 60 wt. of theaqueous emulsion, with the weight ratio of asphalt to wax varying from about 1 to 1 to about 10 to 1.Various methods are known for preparing the wax asphalt emulsion, as reported in US A 3,935,021 to D.R.Greve and E.D. O Neill, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. Commercially availablewax asphalt emulsions that can be used in the composition of the present invention are sold by UnitedStates Gypsum Co. Wax Emulsion , Monsey Products, No. 52 Emulsion and Douglas Oil Co. Docal No.1034 . The amount of wax asphalt emulsion used can be within the range of about 3 to about 10 wt. ,preferrably about 5 to about 7 wt. , based on the total weight of the ingredients of the composition fromwhich the set gypsum core is made, said ingredients including the water of the wax asphalt emulsion, butnot including additional amounts of water that are added to the gypsum composition for forming an aqueousslurry thereof. A particularly preferred material for use in improving the water resistant properties of the gypsum corecomprises a mixture of materials, namely, poly vinyl alcohol and wax asphalt emulsion of the aforementionedtype. The use of such additives to improve the water resistance of gypsum products is described inaforementioned US A 3,935,021. The source of the poly vinyl alcohol is preferably a substantially completely hydrolyzed form of poly vinylacetate , that is, about 97 to 100 hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate. The poly vinyl alcohol should becold water insoluble and soluble in water at elevated temperatures, for example, at temperatures of about60 to 96 C 140 to 205 F . In general, a 4 wt. water solution of poly vinyl alcohol at 20 C will have aviscosity of about 25 to 70 mPas 25 to 70 cp as determined by means of the Hoeppler falling ball method.Commercially available poly vinyl alcohols for use in the composition of the present invention are availablefrom E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, sold under the trademark Elvanol and from Monsanto Co.,sold under the trademark Gelvatol . Examples of such products are Elvanol, Grades 71 30, 72 60, and 70 05,and Gelvatol, Grades 1 90, 3 91, 1 60, and 3 60. Air products Corp. also sells the product as WS 42. The amounts of poly vinyl alcohol and wax asphalt emulsion used should be at least about 0.05 wt. and about.2 wt. respectively. The preferred amounts of poly viny alcohol and wax asphalt emulsion areabout 0.15 to about 0.4 wt. and about 3.0 to about 5.0 wt. respectively. Unless stated otherwise, theterm wt. when used herein and in the claims means weight percent based on the total weight of theingredients of the composition from which the set gypsum core is made, said ingredients including thewater of the wax asphalt emulsion, but not including additional amounts of water that are added to thegypsum composition for forming an aqueous slurry thereof. An attractive feature of the present invention is that the fibrous mat faced gypsum support member canbe made utilizing existing wallboard manufacturing lines, for example, as shown somewhat diagramaticallyin Figure 1. In conventional fashion, dry ingredients not shown from which the gypsum core is formed arepre mixed and then fed to a mixer of the type commonly referred to as a pin mixer 2. Water and otherliquid constituents not shown used in making the core are metered into the pin mixer 2 where they arecombined with the dry ingredients to form an aqueous gypsum slurry. Foam is generally added to the slurryin the pin mixer to control the density of the resulting core. The slurry 4 is dispersed through one or moreoutlets at the bottom of the mixer 2 onto a moving sheet of fibrous mat 6. The sheet of fibrous mat 6 isindefinite in length and is fed from a roll not shown of the mat. As is common practice in the manufacture of conventional paper faced gypsum board, the two oppositeedge portions of the fibrous mat 6 are progressively flexed upwardly from the mean plane of the mat 6 andthen turned inwardly at the margins as to provide coverings for the edges of the resulting board 40, InFigure 1, this progressive flexing and shaping of the edges of the mat 6 are shown for only one side edge.of the mat and the conventional guiding devices which are ordinarily employed for this purpose are omittedfrom the figure for the sake of clarity. Figure 7 shows an edge of the set gypsum core 42 covered by theoverlapped edge portion 6a of the mat 6. Figure 7 shows also score marks 10 and 10a of the mat 6, thescore marks permitting the formation of good edges and flat surfaces. The score marks 10 and 10a aremade by a conventional scoring wheel 12. An advantage of using the preferred form of glass fiber mat isthat it is capable of being scored and edged like conventional paper facing. Another sheet of fibrous mat 16 is fed from a roll not shown onto the top of the slurry 4, therebysandwiching the slurry between the two moving fibrous mats which form the facings of the set gypsum core42 which is formed from the slurry. The mats 6 and 16 with the slurry 4 sandwiched therebetween enter the nip between the upper and lower forming or shaping rolls 18 and 20, and are thereafter received on aconveyer belt 22. Conventional edge guiding devices, such as indicated at 24 shape and maintain theedges of the composite until the gypsum has set sufficiently to retain its shape. In due course, sequentiallengths of the board are cut and further processed by exposure to heat which accelerates the drying of theboard by increasing the rate of evaporation of excess water in the gypsum slurry. With reference to Figure 7, it has been observed that the set gypsum of the core 42 is effective informing satisfactory bonds with the mats and between the edge portions of the overlying mat 16 and theoverlapped edge portion 6a of the underlying mat 6, thus making it unnecessary to use a bond improver inthe slurry or an edge paste to form the aforementioned bonds. The preferred form of mats 6, and 16, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, comprises glass fiber filaments 30oriented in random pattern and bound together with a resin binder not shown . A preferred form of glass fiber mat faced gypsum board 40 is shown in Figures 4 and 7, It comprisesone in which the set gypsum of the core 42 penetrates substantially through the thickness of the mat 6 oversubstantial area portions thereof and in which the set gypsum of the core 42 penetrates the mat 16 partially,with the surface being thus substantially free of set gypsum. The gypsum free surface of mat 16, as seen inFigure 8, is highly textured, and provides an excellent substrate for adhering thereto an overlyingcomponent inasmuch as it comprises many interstices into which an adhesive composition can flow andbond. In shipping gypsum board, it is convenient to package two boards 40 and 40a together see Figure 10and 11 , with the glass fiber gypsum free surfaces 41 and 41a in face to face relationship, and thusprotected, and with the gypsum coated surfaces for example, 43A in Figure 11 forming the outside of thepackage. The set gypsum on the outside surfaces helps to keep the board from being damaged duringhandling, shipping and storage, and protects the skin of those who come in contact with the board frombeing irritated by the glass fibers of the mat. The phrase substantially penetrated by set gypsum, as used herein, means that the set gypsum of thecore, extends from the mat surface which is contiguous to the core to the outer mat surface and coats glassfibers on the outer surface with a thin film of set gypsum to the extent that the outline of glass fibers can beseen through the thin film of set gypsum. The phrase over substantial area portions of the outer surface ,as used herein, means that about 30 to about 75 of the outer surface area of the mat is substantiallypenetrated by set gypsum. Preferably, about 45 to about 55 of the outer surface area of the mat issubstantially penetrated by set gypsum. Accordingly, the gypsum coated surface of this preferred embodimentof the board comprises a surface that has a roughened or patterned appearance it does not comprisea smooth continuous coating of set gypsum. This preferred form of board can be formed with relativelysmall amounts of gypsum slurry being deposited on the underlying support surface, thus minimizing theneed to clean the surface. The need for such cleaning can be substantially avoided by adjusting the viscosity. of the slurry so thatit penetrates but part way through the underlying fibrous mat, for example, up to about 50 of its thickness.Thus, this preferred form of board has two gypsum free fiber faced surfaces. The manufacture of the aforementioned preferred forms of board can be accomplished by controllingthe viscosity of the aqueous slurry of the calcined gypsum in a manner such that the slurry penetrates theunderlying and overlying mats to the desired degree. In manufacturing each of the aforementionedpreferred forms of board, the viscosity of the slurry should be such that it penetrates about 10 to 50 ofthe thickness of the overlying mat over the entire surface area thereof. The recommended means for controlling the viscosity of the slurry is to add thereto a viscosity controlagent. Such viscosity control agents are known in the field of gypsum board manufacture. A preferredviscosity control agent is paper fiber. Examples of other agents that can be used are cellulosic thickeners,bentonite clays and starches. The particular viscosity values that are used in the manufacturing operation can vary from oneapplication to the next, depending on the porosity of the mat, and the desired penetration of the slurry.Accordingly, for any particular application, the viscosity value is best determined empirically. In using the preferred form of glass fiber mat, as described above, to manufacture the aforementionedpreferred forms of board, developmental work has shown that satisfactory results can be achieved utilizing agypsum slurry having a viscosity within the range of about 5 to 7 Pas 5000 to 7000 cp . As used herein,the viscosity value refers to Brookfield viscosity measured at a temperature of 21.1 C 70 F at 10 rpmutilizing paddle No.3. It should be appreciated that the amount of viscosity control agent added to the slurryto give the desired viscosity will vary depending on the particular agent used and the specific viscositydesired. In preferred form, the core of the fibrous mat faced gypsum board has a density of 640 to 800 kg m3 40 to 50 lbs cubic ft. , most preferably about 670 to 720 kg m Turning now to Figures 12 and 13, there is shown therein an example of an exterior insulating systemfabricated in accordance with the present invention and comprising the exterior portion of the building 81.The ElSystem 80 comprises panels of fibrous mat faced board 82 affixed by nails 84 to wood framing 86. Afoamed polystyrene panel 88, about 2.54 cm 1 inch thick, is adhered to the fibrous mat faced board 82 byadhesive 90. A reinforcing member comprising glass fiber skrim 92 is sandwiched between the polystyrenepanel 88 and the final finishing material 94 by adhesive 96. Various of the preferred forms of the gypsum board of the present invention can be used also to goodadvantage in place of conventional gypsum sheathing in applications other than ElSystems. Thus, thepreferred forms of board can be used as an underlying support surface which is covered with overlyingfinishing materials, for example, aluminum, wood siding, plaster and Portland cement stucco. The formulation set forth below is an example of a preferred aqueous gypsum slurry which can be usedin making the core of a gypsum support member in accordance with the present invention. The above formulation was used to prepare gypsum board, the surfaces of which were covered withnonwoven fiber glass mat. The mat was composed of glass fiber filaments oriented in a random patternbonded together by an adhesive referred to by the manufacturer as a modified urea formaldehyde resin .The mat had a thickness of 0.084 cm 33 mils , was more porous than paper of the type used as the coversheet of gypsum wallboard, and was not significantly weakened by water. The air permeability of the matwas 213 m Continuous length board was made from the above gypsum slurry and glass fiber mat on aconventional wallboard machine. The slurry was fed onto a moving sheet of the mat as it was unrolled froma roll onto a moving support surface. The mat had a width of about 129.5 cm 51 inches and was scoredcontinuously by conventional scoring blades prior to the deposition of the slurry thereon. Each edge of themat was scored with two score marks, with each of the outer scores being about 2.54 cm 1 inch from itsrespective edge of the mat and each of the inner scores being about 3.81 cm 1 1 2 inch from itsrespective edge. After the slurry was deposited on the mat, the edges were folded at the score marks andoverlapped on top of the slurry. The gypsum core formed from this operation had a width of 121.5 cm 47 7 8 inches and a thickness of 1.27 cm 1 2 inch . Mat from another roll thereof and having a width of 120.6cm 47 1 2 inches was fed onto the top of the gypsum slurry and the overlapped edge portions of theunderlying mat. The gypsum slurry penetrated the overlapped edge portions and served to bond the edgeportions of the overlying mat to the overlapped edge portions of the underlying. mat. The viscosity of the gypsum slurry was about 5.9 Pas 5900 cp at 21.1 C 70 F . At this viscosity, theslurry penetrated substantially through some portions of the underlying mat to form a thin film thereof onabout 40 to 50 of the area of the outer surface of the mat. As the gypsum in the film set, substantialportions of the outer surface of the mat were covered with a thin film of set gypsum. The surface had aroughened appearance with outlines of the glass filaments being observable underneath the thin coatings ofgypsum which covered them. However, at the aforementioned viscosity, the slurry penetrated but a portion about 0.013 cm 5 mils of the thickness of the overlying mat over the entire area thereof, with no slurrybeing observed on the outer surface of the mat. As the gypsum set in the intermediate portions of the matthat were penetrated by the slurry, it formed a bond that included a mechanical interlock with the setgypsum core. The continuous length board is cut into lengths of about 243.8 cm 8 feet . Drying of the gypsum boardis accelerated by heating in an oven at 177 C 350 F for about 2 hours and until the board is almost dryand then at 93 C 200 F for about 1 hour until it is dried completely. The density of the board is about689 kg m The gypsum free surfaces of panels 61 X 61 cm 2 X 2 of glass fiber faced boards as describedabove were adhered to panels of expanded polystyrene utilizing two different commercially availableadhesive systems. In one system, hereafter System A , one of the faces of a panel of expandedpolystyrene having a thickness of about 2.54 cm 1 inch and 61 X 61 cm 2 X 2 was smeared with anadhesive mixture comprising cement, sand, and resin binder utilizing a 0.95 X 0.95 cm 3 8 X 3 8 toothedtrowel. The panel was then adhered to the glass fiber faced gypsum board. Thereafter, glass fiberreinforcing mesh was applied to the other face of the panel of expanded polystyrene and a decorative finishwas applied to the mesh. In the other system, hereafter System B , the same steps as described above for System A werefollowed except that an acrylic adhesive was applied to the gypsum free surface of the board and thepolystyrene panel adhered thereto. Two additional systems like Systems A and B above were assembled, except that conventional paper facedgypsum sheathing was substituted for the glass fiber faced gypsum board in each of Systems A andB. The integrity of each of the systems was evaluated using 3.8 X 3.8 cm 1 1 2 X 1 1 2 cross sectionalcubes which were extracted from the systems and which were pulled apart in a tensile test apparatus. Theresults of the testing are set forth below. Glass fiber faced gypsum boards, made as described above, and with their edges protected, wereplaced outdoors for several months and exposed to the elements. During that period, the boards wereexposed to about 51 cm 20 inches of rain. After this exposure, the boards were examined and found to bein excellent condition with no signs of deterioration. Other outdoor tests have shown that glass fiber mat faced gypsum board in accordance with thepresent invention and having a core which includes wax asphalt emulsion as a water resistant additivebetter resists deterioration than a like board having a core which includes sodium methyl siliconate as thewater resistant additive. Gypsum board comprising a set gypsum core faced with a fibrous mat, as described herein, andpreferably gypsum board comprising a set gypsum core sandwiched between two sheets of porous glassmat, can be used to particular advantage also as a component of a shaft wall assembly or similar assemblyin the interior of a building. In such application, the fibrous mat faced board can be used to particularadvantage in place of conventional paper faced gypsum core board or shaft liner panels, the core of whichgenerally includes fire resistant additives. Assemblies of this type generally comprise metal framework ofstuds for support of the gypsum panels which form the walls of the shafts of elevators, stairwells and thelike. Examples of such assemblies are shown in US A 4,047,335 4,324,082 and 4,364,212. Fibrous mat facedboard, as described herein, can be used, for example, in the assemblies described in theaforementioned patents, and particularly as the shaft liner panel. For use in such application, the core of theboard can include fire resistant additives. In summary, it can be said that the present invention provides in a practical way important functionalimprovements in exterior finishing systems for buildings, including particularly exterior insulating systems,and in shaft wall assemblies.
