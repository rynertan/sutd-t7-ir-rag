# RESIN USEFUL FOR PREPARING AN ELECTROPHOTOGRAHIC TONER

## Abstract
A resin useful for preparing an electrophotographic toner, comprising particles of a double layer structure composed of A a layer of a low temperature melting emulsion polymer hav ing a 4 mm descending temperature of 90 to 130 C and B a layer of a high temperature melting emulsion polymer having a 4 mm descending temperature of 130 to 170 C, said particles of the resin having a 4 mm descending temperature of 100 to 150 C. The 4 mm descending temperature is defined as the temperature at which the plunger of a flow tester descends 4 mm in a referential test set forth in JIS K 7210 under condi tions involving a die diameter of 1 mm, a die length of 10 mm, a load of 100 kg cmÂ² and a temperature raising rate of 6 C.
