# IMPROVED TAR FRACTION FOR DRIVEWAY SEALERS USING OXIDIZED COAL TAR DISTILLATE

## Abstract
A driveway sealer less affected by temperature ex tremes can be made from an oxidized coal tar distillation cut. The sealer incorporates a middle cut crude distillate which is oxidized to produce a product of desired viscosity. The sealer incorporating this oxidized middle cut is less affected by extremes in weather as compared to regular sealer tar. It has more consistent physical properties. A significant distinguishing characteristic derived from the use of this tar in a driveway sealer is the reduced odor of the resulting sealer. The oxidation condensation step is carried out at elevated temperature by sparging copious quantities of air rapidly into the tar at elevated temperatures of the order of about 300 F to 800 F 200 C 430 C .
