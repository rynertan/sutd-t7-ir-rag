## Description
It is accepted dogma that typically ovulation of a single, fertilisable ovum each menstrual cycle completes a course of oogenesis that began during fetal development. It is not known, however, why from among the thousands of follicles present from birth, only a relative few are recruited each cycle to grow while at the same time others remain at rest. It is also not known why from the host of follicles maturing in each ovary, typically only a single follicle escapes atresia and is selected to ovulate each cycle. Since the vast majority of follicles fall victim to atresia greater than 99 , understanding the selection of the follicle destined to ovulate is fraught with the inherent difficulty of studying the rare exception rather than the predominant rule. One must be extremely careful to distinguish follicle growth that culminates in ovulation gametogenic follicle growth from that ending in atresia. The latter stages of oogenesis in adults i.e. folliculogenesis are known to depend, to a large degree, on a complex interplay of hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovary. However, even though much more is understood about these endocrine relationships today, what determines the fate of an individual follicle remains largely unknown. Since in higher primates both ovaries are functional, the maturation of a single follicle with the potential to ovulate brings with it the obvious concomitant of one active and one gametogenically quiescent ovary each cycle. It is not known how just, typically, a single follicle matures to ovulation on only one ovary each cycle, even though both ovaries are perfused by a common systemic circulation. Three glycoprotein hormones, luteinizing hormone or LH , follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG can act on the ovary to stimulate steroid synthesis and secretion. LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary and together play a central role in regulating the ovarian menstrual cycles and ovulation. hCG is secreted by the developing placenta from the early stages of pregnancy and its role is to maintain steroid secretion by the corpus luteum, which is necessary to preserve the conceptus during early pregnancy. In the normal or natural cycle, there is a mid cycle surge in LH concentration in blood which is followed by ovulation. An elevated estrogen level, which is brought about by the endogenous secretion of LH and FSH acting to stimulate ovarian follicular maturation, is required for the LH surge to occur. The estrogen mediates a positive feedback mechanism which results in the increased LH secretion. It is now known how to employ exogenous hormonal stimulation by administering mixed human menopausal gonadotropins, i.e. a combination of FSH and LH, as a prelude to ovulation or follicle aspiration for oocyte collection in Administration of human meopausal gonadotropins to ovaltory monkeys produces familiar bilateral ovarian hyperstimulation with attendant superphysiologic elevations of circulating estradiol. Despite these elevated estrogen levels, the monkeys usually failed to manifest timely gonadotropin responses to estrogen positive feedback, i.e., stereotypically these normal, intact, cycling primates do not have the expected mid cycle like LH surges despite escalating levels of serum estradiol that usually exceed 400pg ml during 12 days of human menopausal gonadotropin therapy. An absence of spontaneous LH surges has also been observed when human menopausal gonadotropin induced ovarian hyperstimulation occurs in post partum monkeys. These observations fit in with the frequent clinical finding that when endocrinologically normal patients are given human menopausal gonadotropins to increase the number of follicles ova available for It is well established that the appropriate application of mixed exogenous gonadotropins has proved efficacious for ovulation induction or for multiple egg retrieval during In the invention a novel use of FSH is in the manufacture of a composition for use in a method of In the invention a novel step of combining an ovum with spermatozoa in a method of This invention relates to an improvement in It has been found that the adminstration of exogeneous FSH in the absence of exogenous LH is capable of inducing the development of multiple ovarian follicles which are responsive to hCG for The same quantities of FSH can be employed as are employed in the conventional exogeneous FSH LH combinations. Generally, the amount of FSH administered daily to a woman being treated will be in the range of about 75 225 IU and preferably in the range of above about 1.5, preferably in the range 3 10 IU kg day. Sufficent hCG is used induce to ovulation when required, i.e. hCG is used in the same quantities as in conventional methods described in the prior art to which reference is made in this specification. Intrasmuscular injection is suitably employed. The compositions may comprise conventional pharmacologically acceptable carriers and other inert ingredients. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 shows the results of serum hormone level assays for one of the groups of monkeys in the following primate studies, and Figure 2 shows the results of serum hormone levels for the infertile patient described in the second study. Eleven adult female cynomolgus monkeys Counting the first day of spontaneous menses as cycle day 1, the monkeys were treated with 25 IU im of FSH twice daily according to three regimens. Group 1 received injections on cycle days 1 11 Groups 2 on cycle days 1 4 and Group 3 on days 8 11. For all monkeys, laparoscopies were performed under ketamine anesthesia, beginning on the first day of FSH treatment and serially every 3 to 5 days thereafter to assess the status of ovarian follicular development. In order to test whether these FSH driven follicles could be ovulated, monkeys in Group 1 only received 1,000 IU im of hCG on day 12 and retrograde lavage of the fallopian tubes for egg collection 72 hours after hCG treatment was employed to determine whether ovulation had actually occured. Daily femoral blood samples were collected beinning on day 1 of the cycle and continued for 40 days or until menstruation. Sera were frozen until radioimmunoassay of LH, FSH, 17 β estradiol and progesterone. The results of the assays on the monkeys in group 1 are shown in the graphs in Figure 1. The injections of FSH on cycle days 1 11 induced dramatic and sustained elevations in serum FSH about 15 ug ml and estradiol about 500 pg ml . Concurrently, ovarian hyperstimulation was manifested by obvious multiple follicular growth 10 15 prominent follicles by cycle day 8 11 . Prior to hCG treatment, serum LH and progesterone remained at basal levels. Within 48 hours after hCG treatment, 1 3 ovulatory stigma were observed on each ovary. Mean serum progesterone and estradiol levels exceeded 15 ng ml and 400 pg ml, respectively, in mid luteal phase, indicative of the collective secretory actions of multiple corpora lutea. That ovulation had actually occurred was indicated by the recovery of one or more eggs from the fallopian tubes of each females. The monkeys treated with FSH during only the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle demonstrated a prompt increase in serum FSH concentrations mostly exogeneous with mean levels near 15 µg ml on day 4. On discontinuation of FSH injections, circulating FSH levels declined precipitously, below the limits of detection in radioimmunoassay cycle days 8 11 . Serum estradiol levels increased in parallel with the initial increase in circulating FSH, with mean peak values exceeding 300pg ml on cycle days 406 but even so, no LH surges were observed. Serum progesterone levels remained basal until the onset of the luteal phase in the subsequent spontaeous ovulatory cycle day 24 2.4 . Laparoscopy prior to FSH treatment revealed no advanced follicular development, while on cycle day 5, both ovaries were enlarged with multiple vesicular follicles. Following withdrawal of FSH treatment, the ovaries gradually returned to normal size over the subsequent week. No ovulatory stigma appeared. Brief administation of FSH on cycle days 8 11 increased serum FSH levels similar to those found in Group 1 and 2. Mean serum estradiol concentrations increased abruptly, but a spontaneous LH surge was present in only one of four monkeys. The follicular phase serum hormonal profiles for the solitary female were indistinguishable from those of an untreated ovulatory cycle. The foregoing animal studies show that FSH can be administered alone to enhance the natural ovarian cycle. A patient who had received human menopausal gonadotropin stimulation for Serum FSH and LH levels were assayed daily over the period days 3 to 9 for a patient treated as in this protocol and the results are shown in Figure 2 which reveals the similarity in those hormone levels for the two cycles in the graphs the boxes indicate the amount of gonadotropin administered and 1 AMP is equivalent to 75 I.U . Evaluation of follicular stimulation and maturation was made on the basis of daily serum estradiol E₂ assays and the number of follicles developed for aspiration. Oocyte maturation was judged by the appearance of the oocyte, cumulus and corona radiata at asspiration. The normalcy of the oocyte was judged by fertilisation and cleavage time and established by induction of pregnancy. The number of concepti transferred is used as a measure of the fertilisation and cleavage time. The serum E₂ values were remarkably similar between cycles A and B during the first three or four days of stimulation, corresponding to cycle days 6 or 7. The individual had adequate FSH stimulation, as judged by the presence of a majority of preovulatory, rather than immature oocytes, and showed consistently increasing serum E₂ values in cycle B. The patient showed increased numbers of follicles, increased numbers oocytes aspirated and increased numbers of concepti transferred. Pregnancy was successfully established. Table 1 details the treatments and results. In the absence of additional LH, the FSH therapy in the normal woman was effective in maintaining an increased number of viable follicles. This is perhaps accomplished by preventing premature follicular atresia which is associated with an increase in post mature oocytes. Greater number of viable oocytes are maintained as judged by 1 the morpholic appearance after laparoscopic retrieval, 2 ability to fertilise, cleave and 3 induce a pregnancy. It is interesting to note that both human menopausal gonadotropin and FSH stimulated cycles continued to show a spread of follicular maturation. Even with a large increase in the number of follicles stimulated and oocytes retrieved, the number of concepti transferred was similar. This may be indicative of an orderly progression of follicles into the gonadotropin responsive maturation stage. In
