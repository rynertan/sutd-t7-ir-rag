# Method for driving solid state image sensor.

## Abstract
A method for driving a solid state image sensor in which the bias charges in a horizontal readout CCD charge coupled device shift register are transferred onto vertical signal lines with the signal charges and then the signal and bias charges are transferred back into the horizontal readout CCD shift register from which are read out the signal charges gener ated at the photosensor or photodiodes .
