## Description
TITLE OF INVENTIONCOMPOSITIONS FOR THERAPEUTIC OR DIAGNOSTIC USE AND APROCESS FOR THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT The present invention relates to compositions which can be used for therapeutic treatment of infections caused by disease generating microorganisms, particularly pathogenic bacteria, such as Gram negative cocci, particularly Gonococci and Meningoeocci, preferably of theGenus Meisseria, such as N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis. The compositions can also be used for prophylactic and diagnostic processes. Moreover, the invention relates to a process for therapeutic treatment of mammals including man. Many bacterial infection courses are initiated by the fact that the bacterium has ability to adhere to epithelium. This adhering capacity is specific in that different bacteria adhere preferentially to different types of epithelial tissues. Thus, studies have shown that the bacterium N. gonorrhoeae shows adhering specificity to vaginal cells Ref. 1 . It has also been shown that the adhering ability of the bacterium N.gonorrhoeae is dependent on pili fimbriae Ref. 2 . Pili are con stituted by protein structures having the ability of recognizing some receptor structure on the surface of the epithelial cell. In addition to the fact thatN gonorrhoeae adheres to vaginal cells it can also agglu tinate human erythrocytes independent of blood group. The present invention has for its purpose to provide a composition or substance having the ability of replacing the normal receptor in vivo in relation to pathogenic bacteria prone to provide infections in man and animals. Another Another object of the invention is to provide such composition or substance which, in addition to the therapeutic use, also can be used diagnostically. A further object of the invention is to provide a process for identification and or quantificatior of the receptor structure of native biologic materials from mammals including man. The invention also relates to a process for purification of bacteria or the acceptor structure of bacteria. The invention is particularly directed to the receptor structure of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, but it should be noted that the invention is not limited to these particular bacteria. In connection with studies and experiments leading to the present invention it has been found that the receptor for N.gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis found on the surface of epithelial cells and erythrocytes contains a structural element having the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R and R4 are same or different and are 3 hydrogen or an organic residue, for example lower alkyl, lower acyl or a carbohydrate residue, or an inorganic residue, such as sulphate or phosphate, with the proviso that when R1 is different from hydrogen OR1 is in alpha configuration, and that when R2 R R4 H R1 is different from CH2 nCOR, where n 3 19 and R is an alkoxy, aryloxy, NHNH2, OH or N3 group. In this structural formula R2, R3 and R4 are preferably all hydrogen, a particularly preferred structural element thus having the formula p D Galp 1 3 a D GalNAcp R1 is suitably an amino acid or a polypeptide residue. According to another embodiment R1 may be lower alkyl, for example methyl. The active component in the composition according to the invention thus contains as an active constituent a structural element suitably having the formula ss D Galp 1 3 a D GalNAcp 1 0 R In this formula symbol R relates to an organic or inorganic residue, which is attached in a configuration and which is of an arbitrary type as long as it does not adversely effect the circumstances in connection with the use of the composition. The said structural element having the above formula is preferably positioned in terminal position, i.e. with the left end of the formula in freely exposed condition. Other preferred structural elements are clear from the following named compounds showing the desired receptor activity as disclosed in the present disclosure. The invention also relates to a process for therapeutic treatment of mammals including man, an active amount of the composition according to the invention being administered to the mammal. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a composition which can be used for identification and or quantification of the said receptor structures in biological material or to purify bacteria or their receptor structures. The composition contains one or several structural elements according to the above covalently or otherwise linked to for example a macromolecular carrier, optionally via a coupling arm.Useful carriers may be synthetically or naturally occurring polypeptides, polysaccharides or other types of polymers or particles. This is conventional in the art, see for example references 4 8, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred structural elements of this type of composition according to the invention are defined above. The active constituents according to the present invention may, in accordance with traditional pharmaceutical practice, be formulated for use in human medicine for therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic purposes. Such pharmaceutical preparations include the active constituent in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may be solid, semisolid or liquid, and in some cases the active constituent according to the invention can be used as such without dilution. The compositions of the invention include those in a form adapted for oral or parenteral use may be used for the treatment of mammals including humans. Suitable forms of the compositions of this invention include tablets, capsules, syrups, suspensions, solutions, reconstitutable powders and sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion. Such compositions may contain conventional pharmaceutical acceptable materials, such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives, disintegrants and the like in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in the manner well understood by those skilled in the art of formulating drugs. Injectable or infusable compositions of a structural element of the invention are particularly suitable as useful blood levels of the structural element can occur after administration by injection or infusion. Several of the active structures according to the invention are previously known from the literature but they have not earlier been disclosed as possessing medicinally useful properties. To the extent the compounds described in the following are new and novel the process for their manufacture is described. Such compounds of the invention known per se form a particular aspect of the invention. Haemagglutination reaction of sheep erythrocytes and human cells independent of ABO status which fimbriated strains of N. gonorrhoeae cause is probably due to interaction between the fimbriae of the bacterium and receptors of erythrocytes from sheep or man including the above mentioned structural element. The adherence of, N. gonorrhoeae to vaginal cells is probably due to interaction between the fimbriae of the bacterium and receptors on the surfaces of the epithelial cells containing the above mentioned structural elements. The invention will in the following be described further by non limiting examples.EXAMPLE 1Inhibition of haemagglutination of erythrocytes from sheep and man with fimbriated strain of N. gonorrhoeae, by, addition of oligosaccharides. In the test there is used a strain ofN. gonorrhoeae international reference strain 3 fromNeisseriaavd. Statens seruminstitutt, Copenhagen,Denmark. and a fresh strain of the same species isolated at the Bacteriological Central Laboratory, LundsHospital, Fund, Sweden . The bacteria were cultivated on a special gonocoo medium, see MÅardh, P.A., Martensson, D,Soltesz, L.V. An effective, simplified medium for the culture of N. gonorrhoeae . Sex.Trans.Dis. Vol. 5, pp. 10 13, 1978, at 37 0C for 18 hours. The bacterial culture was slurried in PBS, pH 7.2 to a density of 109 bacteria ml. Haemagglutination was performed using erythrocytes from sheep or man O1Rh which were washed with PBS and suspended to a concentration of. 1 v w in PBS, pH 7.2.The agglutination tests were performed so that 25 l of the bacterial suspension was titrated in PBS by using two fold fibre steps. Then 25 rl of the erythrocyte suspension which had been made 1 were added. The haemagglutination titre Hu was determined after incubating the plates microtitre plates, Limbo Sc.Comp. Inc. for 2 4 hours in room temperature. In the haemagglutination inhibition tests there were used serial dilutions having the relevant inhibitor 50 Ml well and 25 l bacterial suspension diluted to contain twice the lowest haemagglutination titre. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C, 25 pl of erythrocyte suspension being then added to each well. The result was read after 2 4 hours incubation at room temperature. The results are presented in tables I and II.

Vaginal cells 1 ml were incubated with the above preincubated bacterial suspensions at 370C for 45 minutes. The incubated suspensions were filtered through a filter pore size 12 and washed 3 times with PBS. The filter was pressed against microscope slides for a few seconds, the microscope slides being then fixed in methanol for 10 minutes. The microscope slides were dried in air and coloured with acridine orange for 2 minutes. After washing and drying in air the slides were studied by means of fluorescence microscopy. The number of bacteria adhering per cell was counted. In each test 50 vaginal cells were counted. It was found that 0.5 mg ml of 1 and 5 mg ml of 2 did not significantly effect adherence, whereas 5 mg ml of 1 reduced the number of adhering bacteria by 87 . EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of compositions containing the structural element in at least bivalent state and covalently linked to a macromolecular carrier.a. Glycoproteins containing the structural element covalently linked to serine or treonine and glycoproteins containing the structural element covalently linked to serine or treonine but wherein the structural element is substituted with one or several N acetyl or N glycolyl neuraminic acid esters, for example k casein, submaxillary mucines, fetuin, M substance, N substance, freezing point depressing glyco proteins in mucus from arctic fishes and glyco proteins in urine where desialylated using mild acid hydrolysis or neuraminidase treatment. The resulting glycoproteins have the structural element ss D Galp 1 3 D GalNAcp a glycosidically linked to themselves.b. The desialylated glycoproteins from a. are treated extensively with pronas and or papin, glycopep sides being obtained. Using known techniques, for example DCC coupling, these can be attached to different other macromolecular carriers.EXAMPLE 4Preparation of compositions containing the structural element according to the invention in at least bivalent state in association with other materials. Desialylated glycoproteins according to Example 3 were made using hydrophobic interaction to lipophilic gels, polymers or particles, for example octyl sepharose, plastics and latex surfaces. EXAMPLE 5Preparation of antibodies showing specificity towards the said structural element. Preparation of monoclonal antibodies by hybridoma technique.I. Balb c mice were immunized with a composition according to the invention. The spleen from hyperimmunized animal is harvested and a cell suspension is prepared by mechanical comminution of the tissue. After gradient centrifugation to obtain a pure cell preparation the cells are fused by means of polyethylene glycol PEG average molecular weight 1500 with establishedB myeloma cell lines from Balb c mice according to known technique. After cloning of the hybridoma cells generating the antibody desired, the cells are propagated on a large scale, the culture medium supernatants being harvested and the antibodies are beIng purified in a conventional manner. For identi fying antibody generating clones there is used so called enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA Ref. 5 . II. Mammals are immunized with an oligosaccharide protein or polymer composition according to the invention. Antibodies are isolated from the huperimmun serum of the mammal and purified in accordance with conventional techniques.EXAMPLE 6Diagnostic test for identification of bacteria having acceptor structures showing specificity towards the structural element according to the invention.a. Bacteria are incubated with sheep erythrocytes and human erythrocytes causing agglutination thereof.In a parallel experiment bacteria are incubated with sheep erythrocytes together with the structural element according to the invention at such concentration that haemagglutination is completely inhibited.Haemagglutination and inhibition of haemagglutination is performed in accordance with Example 1. Positive haemagglutination of sheep erythrocytes and complete inhibition of haemagglutination after addition of oligosaccharide verifies the fact that the bacteria possess acceptor structure.b. Bacteria are incubated with a composition wherein the structural element in question is covalently or through other association in multivalent form linked to a particular matrix according to Example 3 or 4. Incubation is performed on microscope slides for 10 15 minutes the preparation being then studied in microscope. If the bacteria possess acceptor structure the particles are covered with bacteria. With negative reaction the particles are free from bacteria.c. Bacteria are admixed with a composition according to Example 3 or 4 on microscope slides, positive reaction resulting in agglutination of particles clad with the said structural element.EXAMPLE 7Purification of bacteria or acceptor structures a. A composition according to Example 4 or 5 above is arranged in the form of a column. A mixture of bacteria is then passed through the column, bacteria possessing acceptor structures being held in the column by interaction with the receptor structures of the column. After rinsing the column can be eluted with buffer containing a receptor active structural element according to the invention and this has for an effect that the bacteria with acceptor structures are eluted in a pure form.b. By a process fully analogous to a. the acceptor structure can be obtained in a pure form. Bacteria or acceptor structures can be used for the manufacture of vaccins or for antibody analyses in for example body fluids, such as blood, urine or mother s milk.EXAMPLE 8Composition for use for the purpose of disinfection By disinfection is here primarily intended removal of bacteria from a surface, for example a wound. A 0.1 percent by weight aqueous solution of the compound p D Galp l 4 D GNAc is prepared and applied by means of a cotton pad onto a surface infected byN.gonorrhoeae. The solution results in effective removal of the bacterium from the surface.EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of EXAMPLE 2 was repeated but in this case cells were collected from young healthy women by scraping the Buccal Mucosae with a wooden spatula.The bacterium used was N.meningitidis, international test strain 3K, Statens Seruminstitut, Copenhagen,Denmark. In the experiments was found that 0.5 mg ml of the oligosaccharide numbered 1 in EXAMPLE 2 reduced the number of adhering bacteria by about 15 , whereas 5 mg ml of 1 provided for a reduction of 90 .
