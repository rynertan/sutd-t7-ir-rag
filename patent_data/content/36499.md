## Description
A POLYSILICON BASE SELF ALIGNED BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR PROCESSAND STRUCTURE The present invention relates to processes for the fabrication of very small integrated bipolar transistors, in which doped polysilicon is used for the base contact, and in which a self aligned contact to the emitter is realized. Numerous integrated circuit devices, structures and techniques of fabricating same, are known to the prior art.The following prior art patents and summaries are submitted to generally represent the state of the art. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 3,852,127 entitled Method of Manufacturing Double Diffused Transistor with Base Region Parts of Different Depths granted December 3, 1974 to J. S. Lamming. The Lamming patent discloses a method of manufacturing a transistor by double diffusion.First one type impurities having a slow diffusion rate to form the emitter region are diffused. Then opposite type impurities having a high diffusion rate to form the base are diffused so that some traverse the emitter region, with the consequence that part of the base impurities are selectively retarded as they travel through the emitter region and penetrate to a lesser depth. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 3,881,242 entitled Method of Manufacturing Semiconductor Devices granted May 6, 1975 to R. Nuttall et al. The Nuttall et al patent discloses a method of providing an ohmic contact for a silicon semiconductor device. The ohmic contact including a layer of tungsten or molybdenum on a polycrystalline silicon layer, includes depositing these two layers consecutively in the same deposition apparatus, the polycrystalline layer being deposited from a silane atmosphere at 700 to 7500C and the metal layer being deposited when a vapour of a compound of the metal, such as the hexafluoride, is supplied to modify the deposition atmosphere, the compound being reduced by the silane. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 3,904,450, entitled Method of Fabricating Injection Logic IntegratedCircuits Using Oxide Isolation granted September 9, 1975 toW. J. Evans et al. The Evans et al patent discloses an integrated injection logic circuit cell structure and its fabrication. A pattern of oxide isolation regions is used to define, at least partially, the introduction of two types of impurities in such a way as to reduce the number of masking steps. Certain of these oxide regions do not penetrate through the conventional epitaxial layer, leaving a lateral buried path to serve as the base of a lateral injection transistor. A pattern of polycrystalline silicon containing impurities is used both as a diffusion source and an interconnection. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 4,006,046 entitled Method For Compensating for Emitter Push Effect in the Fabrication of Transistors granted February 1, 1977 toP. C. Pravin. The Pravin patent discloses a semiconductor wafer having a base dopant source disposed on its surface which receives a surface coating consisting of, for example, a silicon nitride film. An emitter opening is formed in the silicon nitride surface coating and a portion of the base dopant source is stripped away within the emitter opening.Diffusion of the base region will result in predetermined geometrical regions of varying concentration of the base dopant as a result of the surface coating and the effect of the oxidizing atmosphere. Subsequent deposition and diffusion of the emitter region provides for smaller base widths and eliminates the need for subsequent deposition and diffusion of high concentration base dopant contact regions. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 4,007,474 entitled Transistor Having An Emitter with A Low ImpurityConcentration Portion and A High Impurity ConcentrationPortion granted February 18, 1977 to H. Yagi et al. TheYagi et al patent discloses a semiconductor device having a high current amplification gain which includes a low impurity concentration in the emitter region of the device, an injected minority carrier diffusion length L greater than the width of the emitter, and a high impurity concentration region of the same type as the emitter overlying at least a. portion of said emitter region which provides a built infield where there is a drift current of minority carriers back toward the base region. The built in field is larger than kT qL so that the drift current adjacent the built infield substantially cancels the minority carrier diffusion current injected from the base region. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 4,080,619 entitled Bipolar Type Semiconductor Device granted March 21, 1978 to K. Suzuki. The Suzuki patent discloses a bipolartype semiconductor device, such as a bipolar transistor, having a heavily doped emitter region, a lightly doped emitter region, a base region, a collector region and a passivation layer or layers on said regions. The passivation layer formed on a surface end of a PN junction between the collector region and the base region is a polycrystalline silicon containing oxygen atoms in a range between 14 and 35 atomic percents. The other passivation layer formed on a surface end of the other PN junction between the base region and the lightly doped emitter region is made of silicon dioxide, which covers also a surface end of lightly doped and heavily doped LH junction between two emitter regions. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 4,157,269 entitled Utilizing Polysilicon Diffusion Sources and SpecialMasking Techniques granted June 5, 1979 to T. H. Ning et al. The T. H. Ning et al patent discloses a method consisting of a sequence of process steps for fabricating a bipolar transistor having base contacts formed of a polysilicon material an emitter contact formed of polysilicon material or metal. The emitter contact is self aligned to the base contacts by the use of process steps wherein a single mask aperture is used for defining the base contacts and the emitter. Reference is made to U. S. Patent No. 4,160,991 entitled High Performance Bipolar Device and Method forMaking Same granted July 10, 1979 to N. G. Anantha et al.The Anantha et al patent discloses a method for manufacturing a high performance bipolar device and the resulting structure which has a very small emitter base spacing. The small emitter base spacing, reduces the base resistance compared to earlier device spacing and thereby improves the performance of the bipolar device. The method involves providing a silicon semiconductor body having regions of monocrystalline silicon isolated from one another by isolation regions and a buried subcollector therein. A base region is formed in the isolated monocrystalline silicon. A mask is formed on the surface of the silicon body covering those regions designated to be the emitter and collector reach through regions. A doped polycrystalline silicon layer is then formed through the mask covering the base region and making ohmic contact thereto.An insulating layer is formed over the polysilicon layer. The mask is removed from those regions designated to be the emitter and collector reach through regions. The emitter junction is then formed in the base region and the collector reach through formed to contact the buried subcollector. Electrical contacts are made to the emitter and collector. The doped polycrystalline silicon layer is the electrical contact to the base regions. Reference is made to the following IBM TechnicalDisclosure Bulletin Publications 1 Method For ReducingThe Emitter Base Contact Distance in Bipolar Transistors byC. G. Jambotkar, Vol. 19, No. 12, May 1977, pages 4601 4 and 2 Stacking Poly Silicon Devices For High Density LSI byI. T. Ho and J. Riseman, Vol. 21, No. 12, May 1979, pages 48434. Reference is made to the publication entitled A NewPolysilicon Process For A Bipolar Device PSA Technology , by Kenji Okada et al., IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,Vol. ED 26, No. 4, April 1979, page 385 389. The present trend in semiconductor technology is toward large scale integration of devices with very high speed and very low power dissipation. It is furthermore the object of the invention to provide a self aligned emitter to polysilicon base process for fabrication a bipolar transistor structure which allows that the devices be made as small as possible by making the vertical junction structure shallower, and reducing the horizontal geometry and which removes the misregistration problem encountered in the process in accordance with the prior art. The object is achieved particulary by the methods of the characterizing part of the claims 1 and 2 and by the transistor of the characterizing part of claim 7. Precise shallow junction profiles can be achieved with ion implantation of dopant species and their subsequent annealing with a thermal cycle. Device horizontal geometry depends to a large extent on the lithographic tools available.Within a given lithographic constraint, however, the use of a self aligned process greatly improves device performance. In a conventional non self aligned process, the transistor base area must be large enough to allow for the opening of base and emitter contacts, plus sufficient leeway for the misregistrations of contacts to doped regions.Since the base area and hence the base collection junction capacitance is a very important parameter in the performance of very fast devices, reducing of this base area to the minimum possible value is a very important feature. The use of a self aligned polysilicon base process is a powerful technique in this respect, since it a allows selfregistration of the emitter implant to the polysilicon base contact, and b allows the metal base contact to be moved from the device base area onto the polysilicon, thus reducing the device base area. The transistor structure formed by this invention is shown in Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C. A deep trench dielectric isolation is used to isolate the device from other devices.on the wafer. A shallow dielectric isolation is used to separate the collector reach through region from the base region. A heavily doped polysilicon layer is used to dope and make contact to the transistor base region, as well as define the emitter window through which the emitter is doped. The polysilicon is covered on both top and side by a layer of silicon dioxide which is deposited by chemical vapor deposition. Contact to the polysilicon, and hence to the transistor base, is done over the deep trench dielectric isolation, thus allowing the transistor base area, and hence the collector base capacitance, to be minimized. In accordance with the invention and in contrast to other self aligned processes where the intrinsic base and emitter are implanted through the same opening, the process allows the intrinsic base to be implanted first with the polysilicon as a mask. This decreases the intrinsic base resistance without affecting the emitter base breakdown or leakage. The process, in accordance with the invention, is inherently simple and gives well defined vertical polysilicon sidewalls with controllable chemically vapor deposited CVD oxide barriers. This is very important in defining very small devices. The process includes a single heat cycle to drive in the emitter and base. No extended heat cycles are needed to grow thick thermal oxides. Other advantages of the inventive method and transistor structure are disclosed in the subclaims. The invention will become more apparent from the following detail description taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings. Figure 1A is a top view of a transistor structure in accordance with the invention. Figure 1B is a cross sectional view taken along the line lB lB of Figure 1A. Figure 1C is a cross sectional view taken along the line lC lC of Figure 1A. Figures 2 through 17 are cross sectional views disclosing the structure at successive stages, or steps in accordance with the invention.Description of the Preferred Embodiments Referring now to the figures of the drawings and Figure 2 in particular, a P type monocrystalline silicon wafer 10 is the starting substrate. An N type impurity is then introduced into substrate 10 forming the subcollector 11.The impurity can be any suitable N type impurity, as for example, arsenic, and can be introduced into the wafer by any suitable technique, as for example, capsule diffusion or ion implantation. The resistivity of the N subcollector layer 11 is approximately 0.001 ohm cm2. As shown inFigure 3, an N type epitaxial silicon layer 12 of approximately 1.0 micrometer to 1.5 micrometer thickness is deposited on the exposed surface. During the epitaxial deposition process, which is a high temperature process, the subcollector region 11 diffuses upward into the region 12. The resistivity of the epitaxial layer is about 0.3 ohm cm2. As shown inFigure 4, an oxide layer 13 preferably deposited by using chemical vapor deposition techniques, of approximately o 3000A thickness is deposited on layer 12.A resist layer 14 is deposited over oxide layer 13 and subsequently exposed and developed to form an opening 15 which overlies the position of the shallow dielectric isolation trench to be fabricated. The resist layer 14 serves as a mask for a reactive ion etching oxide operation. The etching is stopped when it reaches the surface of epitaxial silicon 12.The resist layer 14 is then stripped. Referring to Figure 5, using the oxide layer 13 as an etch mask, the exposed silicon in region 15 is then etched by a reactive ion etching technique. The etching will be stopped when it reaches to the N subcollector region 11.The remaining oxide mask layer 13 is stripped by a chemical solution, for example, buffer HF solution. Referring to Figure 6, a CVD oxide layer 16, approximately o 6000 7000A thick, is then deposited on the wafer. A resist layer 17 is deposited and subsequently exposed and developed to form window 18A 18B which overlies the position of the deep dielectric isolation trench to be fabricated. The resist layer 17 serves as a mask for the reactive ion etching of oxide layer 16. The etching is stopped when the silicon layer 12 is reached. The resist layer is then stripped. Using the oxide layer 16 as shown in Figure 7, as an etch mask, the exposed silicon in window region 18A 18B is reactive ion etched. As shown in Figure 7, the reactive ion etching of silicon is stopped when it etches through epitaxial layer 12, subcollector layer 11 and reaches into the P substrate 10 to form deep trench 19. The depth of the deep trench 19A 19B is approximately 4 5 micrometer. The remaining masking oxide 16 is then stripped. As shown in Figure 8, the wafer is thermally oxidized to form an oxide layer 20 over the exposed silicon surface.The thickness of the thermal oxide grown is about 1000 o 2000A. Referring to Figure 9, a thick oxide layer 21 formed byCVD technique is used to fill the shallow trench 15 and deep trench 19A 19B and also planarize the wafer surface. For a 3 micrometer wide deep trench the oxide thickness required to overfill the trench is about 3 micrometers. As shown inFigure 9, crevices in the center area of the overfilled trenches may be formed. In this case a blanket resist layer 22 may be applied and appropriately treated to planarize the surface 21. The subsequent process step is the use of RIE to thin back the resist layer 22 and the oxide layer 21. Of primary importance is that the etch rate of RIE resist is nearly equal to that of RIE SiO2. Thus, with an equal thickness of resist and SiO2 everywhere over the wafer, a back etching to the silicon will yield a planar surface with filled in deep trench 19A 19B and shallow trench 15 as shown in Figure 10. As demonstrated in Figure 11, a resist layer 23 is deposited on the wafer surface. The resist layer 23 is exposed and developed to form a block out opening 24 which overlies the intended transistor reach through region. A suitable N type impurity preferably phosphorus, is ion implanted into the epitaxial layer 12 to form reach through region 25. The resist layer 23 is then stripped. As shown in Figure 12, a layer of polycrystalline o silicon 26 of approximately 3000A thickness is deposited by chemical vapor deposition onto the epitaxial surface 12.The polycrystalline silicon can be either in situ doped with boron during the deposition step, or alternatively it can be doped after the deposition step by an ion implantation with boron. In either case its boron concentration should be high, of the order of 1020 atoms per cubic centimeter.Next, a layer of silicon dioxide 27 of approximately 3000A thickness is deposited by chemical vapor deposition.Subsequently, a photoresist layer 28 is deposited on the wafer. The resist layer is then exposed and developed to form windows 29 where the oxide and polysilicon will be removed. The oxide 27 is then removed by a reactive ion etch, using the resist layer as a mask. The etch used should etch silicon dioxide much faster than resist. The resist 28 is then stripped off. Next, the polysilicon 26 is etched using the oxide 27 as a mask, with a reactive ion etch which etches silicon much faster than oxide. The device at this point is shown in Figure 13. The polysilicon etch stop point can be monitored at the polysilicon oxide interface 30. As shown in Figure 14, a thin thermal screen oxide 31 o of approximately 300A thickness is grown on all exposed silicon surfaces. Next a low dose boron ion implantation is done to form the active base region 32. The boron implant.is allowed to penetrate the reach through region 25 also, where it will be compensated by the much higher phosphorus dose. As shown in Figure 15, a layer of silicon dioxide 33 of o approximately 3000A thickness is deposited by chemical vapor deposition. Since such an oxide layer is highly conformal, the oxide on the sides as well as the top of the polysilicon and oxide layer 26 and 27 will be approximately 3000A thick. The oxide layer 33 is then etched away using a reactive ion etch for which the etch rate of oxide is much faster than the etch rate of silicon. The device at this point is shown in Figure 16. Since the reactive ion etch is o highly directional, the 3000A thick oxide 33 on the sides of the polysilicon will remain. Next, a low energy arsenic ion implant 34 is done to form the emitter. The arsenic implant also enters the reach through 25 to reduce the contact resistance there. The arsenic implant is shielded from the polysilicon 26 by the oxide layer 27. As shown in Figure 17, a thermal cycle is done to anneal and activate the implanted reach through 35, active base 32, and emitter 36. Simultaneously, the boron in the heavily doped polysilicon 26 will outdiffuse to form the extrinsic base 37. Next, a base contact 38 to the polysilicon is opened by photolithography and etching. The device is now ready for deposition and fabrication of the metallurgy which will interconnect the device with other devices on the wafer. The forming of the metallurgy system is well known in the art and will not be described. While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
