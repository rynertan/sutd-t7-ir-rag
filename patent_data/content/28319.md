# Method and apparatus for effecting a repeated chemical analysis of a process stream.

## Abstract
The continually repeated chemical analysis of a process stream sample is effected by interposing the sample in a flow of titrant, flow of which is interrupted only to permit the interposition of the sample in the line of flow. A holding zone or chamber, e.g. a chromatographic column 13 receives and holds titrant until the interposed sample in the column is titrated. Reaction product eluted from the column is detected.
