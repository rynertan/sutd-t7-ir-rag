# SPOT QUANTITATION

## Abstract
Describes a method and system for improving the ability to quantitate the amount of flux or material in localized collections of such flux or material typically called a spot . Quantitation of spots using a software algorithm which utilizes reduction volumes for quantitating peaks in a spot image of an electrophoresis gel is disclosed. The operating system includes a laser gel scanner module, a computer module, system peripherals, and analysis software.
