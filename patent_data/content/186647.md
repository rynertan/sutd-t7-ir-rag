# Process for preparing glyphosate and glyphosate derivatives.

## Abstract
A process for preparing glyphosate and derivatives of related structure. A precursor primary or secondary amine, such as glycine, is condensed with a carbonyl compound, such as formylphosphonic acid or its acetals, and the condensation product is reduced to produce the desired product.
