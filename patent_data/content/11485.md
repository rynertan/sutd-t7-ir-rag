# Acid formates containing cementitious compositions and process for preparing them.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the use of sodium, potassium and ammonium salts of formic acid as early strength developers and setting accelerators in hydraulic cements, concretes, mortars and plasters. The salts used are acidic salts containing between 1.5 and 5 moles of the formulate ion per mole of the cation. These salts have much greater solubility and are more effective than the corresponding cal cium salts, particularly under low temperature conditions.
