# An assembly comprising a flange and a channel shaped strip.

## Abstract
A flange 18 has projections 16 which engage lips 14 on a sealing strip 2 to attach the strip 2 to the flange 18 . The strip 2 has two side portions 10 extending from a base 4 and the lips 14 are formed on the inner surface of the side portions 10 . The free edge 20 of the flange 18 presses against a diaphragm 6 spaced by a void 8 from the base 4 . As a result, the pressure of the diaphragm 6 on the flange 18 forces the projections 16 into abutment with the lips 14 . As a result, the flange 18 and the strip 2 are securely connected so that a considerable force is required to remove the strip 2 from the flange 18 thereby preventing accidental separation. A tubular member 12 may be attached to one of the side portions 10 against which abuts an object being sealed to the flange.
