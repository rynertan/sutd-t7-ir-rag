## Description
Luminescent screen. The invention relates to a luminescent screen provided with a luminescent nitride. In the extensive literature with regard to luminescent materials, in which a large number of materials are described, a luminescent nitride is found only incidentally. German Patent Specification 739,390 describes a manganese activated aluminium nitride AlN . In Izv. Akad.Nauk SSSR, Neorg. Mater. 1981 17 8 , 1421 5 magnesium silicon nitrides MgSiN2 activated by lanthan des are described. Practical applications of such a luminescent nitride, for example in the luminescent screen of a discharge lamp or of a cathode ray tube, substantially do not occur. The invention has for its object to provide luminescent screens provided with novel luminescent materials having a very stable crystal lattice and provided with suitable activator elements. For this purpose, a luminescent screen according to the invention is provided with a luminescent nitride and is characterized in that the nitride is an oxynitride corresponding to the formula Si6 xAlxOxN8 x Ay, in which A represents at least one activator element replacing Al and chosen from the group comprising Cu, Ag,Zr, Mn, In, Bi and the lanthanides, in which up to 75 mol. of the Al can be replaced by B and or Ga and in which yS xC 4.5 and 0.016 C 1.5. It has besn found that the oxynitrides of Si and Al form excellent host lattices for the aforementioned activator elements. These oxynitride lattices are known per se cf. J. Mater. Sci., 11 1976 , 1135 58. A material in the Si Al O N system is known under the designation sialon. The sialons are temperature resistant ceramic materials. They are derived from silicon nitride Si3N4 by replacing simultaneously Si by Al and N by 0. Similarly to the structure of Si3N4 occurring in an phase and a phase , the sialons occur in an2and as crystal structure.They are designated as t sialon and p sialon, respectively.As appears from the above formula, at most 75 mol. of theSi can be replaced by Al xL 4.5 . With higher Al contents, the sialon crystal structure is in fact no longer obtained.Furthermore, experiments have shown that in the sialons theAl can be replaced by B and or Ga up to at most 75 mop. . Higher B and or Ga contents are not used because then the sialon structure is lost and or too low luminescence efficiencies are obtained. The activator content y in the luminescent oxynitrides is chosen between the aforementioned limits. At values of y smaller than 0.01 the absorption of the excitation energy is in fact too small, whereas at values of y larger than 1.5 the luminescence efficiency generally becomes too low due to concentration quenching. The luminescent oxynitrides in a luminescent screen according to the invention can be satisfactorily excited, as has been found, both by ultraviolet radiation and by electrons and also by X ray radiation. The radiation then emitted is characteristic of the element used as an activator. Such a screen consisting, for example, of a carrier to which the luminescent oxynitride is applied can therefore be used advantageously in discharge lamps, cathoderay tubes and X ray screens. A great advantage of a luminescent screen according to the invention is that the oxynitride used is very stable.In practical applications, it can therefore be subjected to high temperatures and high excitation energy densities.This is naturally of importance, for example, in heavily loaded discharge lamps and heavily loaded cathode ray tubes. A further advantage of the luminescent oxynitrides is that by means of the 0 N ratio the absorption edge of the host lattice and also the absorption band of the activator centre can be adjusted within certain limits.Thus, it is possible to obtain a certain adaptation to the excitation used in a given application. If the activator element A is not trivalent, in the case of substitution of Al by A the charge is compensated for by a suitable adjustment of the 0 N ratio.Luminescent oxynitrides are Preferred, which contain biand or trivalent activators. Therefore, a luminescent screen according to the invention is preferably characterized in that the oxynitride corresponds to the formulaSi6 xAlx p qAp 2 Aq 3 Ox pN8 x p, in which A2 represents at least one aotivator element from the group comprisingMn, Zr and the bivalent lanthanides and A3 represents at least one activator element from the group comprisingIn, Bi and the trivalent lanthanides and in which 0.01L x 4.5, 0.01 p q 1.5, o p 1.5 and o q 1.5. The highest efficiencies are generally obtained with luminescent screens provided with an oxynitride having thesssialon crystal structure. Such screens are therefore preferred. rrhe optimum results are obtained if the luminescent screen contains an oxynitride in which 1 x 4 and the activator content is not lower than 0.05 and not higher than 0.50, i.e. 0.05L y 0.50 or 0.05 p qA 0.50. Embodiments of luminescent screens according to the invention are preferred, in which the activator element is one or more of the trivalent lanthanides. With these activators, the emissions most suitable for practical use are in fact obtained. The luminescent oxynitrides can generally be obtained by a solid state reaction at a high temperature.Very pure starting materials for example Si3N4, Al203 and AlN are then used. The reaction takes place, for example, for a few hours at a temperature in the range of 1300 16000C in a neutral or weakly reducing atmosphere. The invention will now be described more fully with reference to a number of examples of luminescent oxynitrides suitable for a luminescent screen according to the invention.Example 1. A mixture was made of 0.7014 g of Si N 0.4333 g of Awl 203 0.2050 g of AlN 0.0561 g of Tb4O7 0.2065 g of CeO2. This mixture was pressed by hand to two pills. The latter were heated in an Awl 0 crucible in a furnace 23 for 3 hours at a temperature of 1550 C. During heating, a neutral atmosphere was maintained in the furnace by passing a flow 100 cc min of pure nitrogen oxygen concentration smaller than 1 ppm through the furnace.After cooling, the product was pulverized. The powder obtained was an oxynitride activated by cerium and terbium corresponding to the formula Si3Al2.7Ce0.24Tb0.06O3N5, which upon excitation by, for example, ultraviolet radiation exhibited the characteristic Tb emission. An X ray diffraction analysis showed that the powder had the R sialon structure and that only traces of other phases were present.Example 2. There was proceeded in quite the same manner as indicated in Example 1. In this case, however, during heating also a quantity of graphite powder was placed in the furnace. As a result, a weakly reducing atmosphere was obtained. The product obtained had the same formula as the product of Example 1 and substantially the same luminescent properties. It was found to have also the sialon structure. Examples 3 to 27 In the same manner as described in Example 1 and Example 2, respectively, a large number of luminescent oxynitrides with different activator elements were manufactured. These activators were added in the desired quantity to the starting mixture as oxides or as compounds forming these oxides upon an increase in temperature. The now following Table 1 states for each of the Examples 1 to 27 the formula of the luminescent oxynitride obtained and indicates how the material is prepared. In the column nPreparation , 1 indicates the method according to the above example 1 neutral atmosphere and 2 indicates the method according to Example 2 weakly reducing atmosphere .Furthermore, Table 1 indicates results of measurements on the luminescet oxynitrides. In the column max emission the location in the spectrum nm of the maximum of the emission band is indicated. The column fez indicates exc the wavelength nm of the exciting ultraviolet radiation.The column rel indicates the relative efficiency of the luminescence upon excitation with the wavelength2 exc in arbitrary units. rel. of Example 1 is then assumed to be 100. Of four examples 1, 5, 24 and 26 , an absolute quantum efficiency in upon excitation by 254 nm radiation is further given. These measurements are stated in column 254 .
