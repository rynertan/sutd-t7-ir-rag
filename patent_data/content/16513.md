# Esters of halogenated substituted cyclopropanoic acids, their preparation and use as insecticides.

## Abstract
Compounds of formula I wherein R¹ and R² are each selected from halomethyl and halo and R is nitro, cyano, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkylcarbonyl, or di or trifluoromethyl, and n has a value of zero to four, and compositions compris ing them are useful as insecticides in agriculture, horticulture and other outlets. They may optionally be combined with other pesticides and or synergists. The compounds may be prepared by conventional esterification processes from the corresponding acids and appropriately substituted benzyl alcohols or halides, some of which are novel.
