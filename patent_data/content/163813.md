# Continuous cigarette rod cutting apparatus for a cigarette making machine.

## Abstract
Cutting edges 32 , for cutting a continuous cigarette rod at right angles to the longitudinal direction thereof, protrude from a rotating head 30 which is tilted with re spect to the travelling direction of the continuous cigarette rod. A pair of fixed guide members 52, 54 face each other in cutting positions for the continuous cigarette rod. The guide members 52, 54 are spaced so that the cutting edge 32 may pass between them without oscillation. As the rotating head 30 rotates, the cutting edge 32 cuts the continuous cigarette rod.
