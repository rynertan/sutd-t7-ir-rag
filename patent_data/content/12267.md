## Description
THERMOSTATIC STEAM TRAP SPECIFICATION This invention relates to steam traps, that is, devices for allowing the escape of hot condensate and gases from a steam line, and, more particularly, to thermostatic steam traps, that is, steam traps operated in response to the temperature of the fluid in the steam line. Thermostatic steam traps generally include a valve and a control chamber in which is carried a control fluid responsive to the fluid temperature on the inlet side of the trap to control the opening and closing of the valve. Normally the control fluid is in a liquid state and vaporizes at a temperature somewhat lower than the steam temperature of the fluid on the inlet side of the trap. In the liquid state when the temperature of the fluid on the inlet side of the trap indicates condensate is present, the condensate pressure opens the valve allowing the passage of the condensate. When the temperature of the condensate approaches that of steam, the control fluid vaporizes exerting a pressure closing the valve and preventing the passage of steam. One type of thermostatic steam trap utilizes a bellows member forming part of the control chamber in which the control fluid is contained. Normally, the bellows member includes a valve member at an end thereof adjacent a valve seat at the discharge passage of the trap. Another type of thermostatic trap includes a diaphragm arrangement in which one face forms part of the control chamber and another face of which cooperates with a valve seat to provide the required valve action. Examples of this latter type of trap are disclosed in United States Patent,No. 4,013,220 and in United States Patent, No. 4,037,784. In both types, the control fluid is placed in the control chamber in liquid state.This means that the various components forming the control chamber are initially welded or otherwise secured together with provision being made for a small inlet opening through which the control fluid is poured in liquid state into the interior of the chamber. Thereafter, the control chamber can be evacuated, but in all cases, the opening must be sealed.Accordingly, the manufacture of thermostatic steam traps is relatively expensive in view of the various manufacturing steps required to form, fill and seal the control chamber. It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention to provide a thermostatic steam trap that is relatively economical to manufacture. It is another object of this invention to provide a thermostatic steam trap including a relatively inexpensive insert assembly that can be manufactured with a minimum number of manufacturing operations. It is still another object of this invention to provide a thermostatic steam trap assembly including a capsule member in which is located a small block of porous material saturated with a generally conventional control fluid. Finally, it is an object of this invention to provide a thermostatic steam trap assembly including generally conventional body member and a relatively economical insert assembly arranged so that the insert assembly is easily replaceable. These and other objects of this invention are accomplished by providing a thermostatic steam trap including a body member and an insert assembly. The insert assembly includes inlet passage means communicating with the inlet side of the body member and discharge passage means communicating with the discharge side of the body member. Intermediate the inlet and discharge passage means is a valve seat that cooperates with one face of the diaphragm means to allow or prevent the flow of fluid through the passage means. The other face of the diaphragm is adjacent the wall of a capsule member forming a control chamber in which is located a small block of porous material saturated with a generally conventional control fluid.The inlet side of the body member communicates with the insert assembly such that a heat exchange relationship between the inlet fluid and the control fluid is provided to control the operation of the diaphragm means. Preferably, the diaphragm means includes a first diaphragm member and a second diaphragm member formed with a central opening such that the second diaphragm member operates as a check valve means to prevent flow of fluid from the discharge passage means back to the inlet passage means. The first and second diaphragm members are normally in abutting relationship so that if the first diaphragm member fails the diaphragms are retained in an open position allowing the passage of fluid. For a better understanding of the invention, reference is made to the following description of preferred embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the figures of the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a sectional view of one embodiment of a steam trap in accordance with this invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged view of the insert assembly used in the steam trap illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a sectional view of another embodiment of a steam trap in accordance with this invention and, Fig. 4 is an enlarged view of the insert assembly used in the steam trap illustrated in Fig. 3. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2 of the drawing, there is illustrated a thermostatic steam trap 10 usable in a steam system to allow condensate to drain off but to retain steam in the system. The steam trap 10 includes a valve body member 12 and a valve insert assembly 14 for controlling the flow of fluid through the body member. In the embodiment of the invention disclosed here, the valve body member 12 is of the Y type and, accordingly, includes an inlet portion 16, an outlet portion 18, and a leg portion 20 extending at an angle to the inlet and outlet portions. It should be particularly understood, however,that any suitable configuration can be utilized.Intermediate the inlet and outlet portions, the body member is formed with a generally cylindrical recess 22 extending inwardly from an outer face thereof and terminating at an annular end face 24 located internally of the body member.A portion of the cylindrical wall forming the recess 22 is formed with threads for receiving and securing the insert assembly 14 to the body member 12 as will be fully explained hereinafter. An inlet passage formed in the body member 12 and includes a first passageway 28 formed in the inlet portion 16, a second passageway 30 formed in the leg portion 20 and a third passageway 32 extending upwardly from the second passageway at a generally right angle to the first passageway and which terminates in the end face 24 and which is coaxially related to the recess 22. Accordingly, the inlet passage communicates between an inlet pipe to which the body member 12 is secured and the recess 22. The passageway 30 is formed with a threaded portion adjacent its free end which cooperates with a threaded portion of a cap member 34 which clamps a strainer 36 in the second passageway. The strainer 36 is a perforated cylindrical member arranged so that incoming fluid flows through the interior of the member, through the perforations and then through the passageway 32.As is usual in the art, the cap member 34 can be removed periodically so that the strainer 36 can be removed and cleaned. Also formed in the body member 12 is an outlet passage which is in the form of a passageway 42 that communicates with the recess 22 through the sidewall thereof and the end face 24.The passageway 42 is suitably adapted to be connected to an outlet pipe connected to the condensate system. The end face 24 of the recess 22 is formed with an annular rib 44 having a surface which extends about the inlet passageway 32. On the surface of the rib member is seated a sealing ring 46 clamped in place by a bearing surface on the insert assembly 14. The outer surface of the body member is formed with a seat 50 in the form of an annular recess extending around the cylindrical recess 22. A sealing ring 52 is located in the seat 50 and is clamped in place by another bearing surface on the valve insert assembly 14. The valve insert assembly 14 includes as best seen inFig. 2, a generally cylindrical insert member 56 formed with a recess 57 at one end that cooperates with the annular rib 44 to clamp the sealing ring 46 in place and is further formed with a radial flange 58 at its other end. Radially inwardly of the radial flange 58, the insert member 56 is formed with an annular recess 60. Inlet passage means is provided in the form of a series of passageways 62 extending from the face of the insert member 56 adjacent recess 57 at an angle to and in communication with the recess 60 whereby the passageway 62 communicate between the recess and the passageway 32 formed in the body member 12.Located centrally of the insert member 56 is a bore 64 and a cross bore 66 which communicate with the face of the body member inwardly adjacent the flange 58 and recess 60 so that the bore 64 and cross bore 66 communicate with the discharge passage 42 formed in the body member 12. The surface of the body member 56 surrounding the bore 64 functions as a valve seat as will be explained hereinafter. Fixed to the insert member 56 is a hat shaped housing member 68 including a cylindrical recessed portion 70 and a radial flange 72. The flange 72 mates with the flange 58 and the upper housing portion 68 can be secured to the insert member 56 by welding at the outer periphery of the flanges 58 and 72.Sandwiched between the flanges 58 and 72 is a diaphragm means 74. In the preferred embodiment of the invention disclosed herein the diaphragm means 74 includes a flexible metal diaphragm 76 adjacent the housing member 68 and a second flexible metal diaphragm 78 adjacent the insert member 56 as best seen in Fig. 2. Normally, as best seen in Fig. 1, the diaphragms 76 and 78 are in abutting face to face relationship. The first diaphragm 76 is a circular sheet metal member and extends across the recessed portion 70 of the housing member 68 so that a closed control chamber 80 is formed. The second diaphragm 78 is an annular sheet metal member overlying the annular recess 60 and is formed with a central opening overlying the bore 64 in the insert member 56.As will be made clear hereinafter the diaphragms 76 and 78 are movable toward and away from the recess 60 and the valve seat surrounding the bore 64 so that they have a first or closed position overlying the recess 60 with the first diaphragm 76 also overlying the valve seat surface and the bore 64 to prevent flow of fluid from the passageways 62 to the bore 64 and a second or open position spaced from the recess 62 to the bore 64 and a second or open position spaced from the recess 60 to allow flow of fluid from the passageways 62 to the bore 64. Thus, the diaphragms 76 and 78 act as valve members. In addition, the diaphragm 76 can be spaced from the recess 60 while the diaphragm 78 overlies the recess 60 to prevent flow of fluid from the bore 64 to the annular recess 60. Thus, the diaphragm 78 acts as a check valve. Carried in the control chamber 80 is a pill shaped block of porous material 82 such as sintered metal or ceramic.The material 82 is saturated with a generally conventional control fluid such as a water alochol mixture so that the control fluid has a boiling point somewhat lower than the boiling point of the live steam in the steam system with which the trap 10 is associated. Fluid on the inlet side of the trap 10 collects in the annular recess 60 and is, thus, in heat exchange relationship with the control chamber 80. When the fluid is condensate, the control fluid, of which there is a relatively small volume, is in a liquid state so that the pressure of the condensate moves and retains the diaphragms 76 and 78 in their open position allowing the escape of the condensate.When the temperature of the condensate approaches that of the steam in the associated system, the control fluid vaporized and the vapor exerts a relatively high pressure on the face of the diaphragm 76 forming part of the control chamber, causing the diaphragms 76 and 78 to move to their closed position. As pointed out previously, the insert assembly 14 seats in the recess 22 with the recessed portion 57 arranged in overlying relationship with the rib 44. The valve insert assembly 14 is retained in assembled relationship with the body member 12 by a bonnet 84 including a cylindrical portion formed with threads that cooperate with the threads formed in the recess 22 and which further includes a flange 86 at one end providing a bearing surface that clamps the sealing ring 52 in the recess 50. The flange 86 is also formed with a wrenching configuration around its periphery to accommodate a tool used to assemble or disassemble the insert assembly 14 with the body member 12. A recessed portion 88 is formed in the bonnet 84 adjacent the other end of the cylindrical portion and forms a seat for retaining spring means in the form of a dish shaped Belleville washer 90.The central portion of the washer 90 bears on the top surface of the upper housing portion 68 and its outer periphery seats tightly against the surface of the recess 88.Accordingly, the spring washer 90 provides a force clamping the insert assembly 14 downwardly against the seal 45 and rib member 44. In order to retain the washer 90 in assembled relationship, the inner cylindrical surface of the recess 88 is formed with a groove in which is located a retaining ring 92 which holds the washer in assembled relationship when the bonnet 84 is removed. In operation, the steam trap is located in a steam system such that fluid in the system passes through the inlet passageways 28, 30, 32 and 62 to the annular recess 60 in the insert member 58. If this fluid is condensate and gases so that its temperature is sufficiently low to keep the control fluid in the liquid state, the pressure of this condensate exerted against the adjacent surface of the diaphragm means 74 is sufficient to lift the diaphragms 76 and 78 off of the recess 60 and valve seat around the passage 64 allowing the fluid to flow through the bore 64 and cross bore 66 to the discharge passageway 42. When the temperature of the incoming fluid increases and approaches that of steam, the temperature of the control fluid, having a lower boiling point, will rise to its boiling point causing the control fluid to vaporize and exert significant pressure in the control chamber 80 acting against the opposite surface of the diaphragm means 74 causing the diaphragms 76 and 78 to move to the closed position preventing the escape of live steam. The opening and closing temperature can be controlled by the proper selection of the control fluid. As noted previously, the diaphragm means 74 is arranged so that diaphragm 78 functions as a check valve in the event of a back surge of pressure from the discharge side of the trap 10. Upon the occurrence of a back surge of pressure, the pressure is exerted directly against the exposed surface of the diaphragm 76 adjacent the bore 64 causing that diaphragm to lift off of the valve seat and away from the recess 66 as shown in Fig. 2. This pressure cannot act on the lower surface of the diaphragm 78 so that the diaphragm is actually pushed downwardly over the recess 60 and inlet passages 62. Accordingly, fluid cannot flow backward into the inlet valve side of the valve body member. From the preceding, various of the advantages of this invention should be understood. The insert assembly 14 is relatively economical and easily replaceable. In manufacture, the sintered metal pill 82 with the control fluid can be placed inside the recessed portion 70 of the housing 68, then this assembly can be mated with the diaphragm means 74 and insert member 56. The flanges 58, 72 and the outer periphery of the diaphragms 76 and 78 can be welded to secure the insert assembly 14 together. During replacement, the bonnet 84 can be loosened and removed and because of the retaining ring 92, the washer 90 is removed therewith. The insert assembly can be easily replaced and the bonnet 84 and spring washer 90 easily reassembled with the body member 12.In the event the diaphragm 76 fractures, the control fluid, of course, leaks through the passageway 32 and the incoming fluid acts on the diaphragm 78. Thus forces the diaphragm 78 is retained in the open position and forces the diaphragm 76 to also move to the open position allowing the discharge of fluid. Referring now to Figs. 3 and 4 of the drawing, there is disclosed another embodiment of a thermostatic steam trap 10a in accordance with this invention. The steam trap 10a is generally similar to steam trap 10 and like parts will be referred to with like reference numerals including the suffix a.Thus, the steam trap 10a includes a body member 12a and an insert assembly 14a. The body member 12a includes an inlet portionl6a, an outlet portion 18a, a leg portion 20a and a generally cylindrical recess 22a terminating in an annular end face 24a. There is also provided inlet passage means including inlet passageways 28a, 30a and 32a. Passageway 32a is formed off center with respect to the recess 22a and is located adjacent the cylindrical wall of the recess 22a so that fluid can flow into a chamber 33a formed by the recess and the bonnet 84a and in which the insert assembly 14a is received. The portion 18a includes a discharge passageway 42a that terminates in the center of the surface 24a of the recess 22a. An annular rib member 44a and sealing ring 46a are also provided. In a manner similar to the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, the body member 12a includes a strainer 36a retained in place by a cap member 34a. Also in a manner similar to the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2 there is provided a seat 50a and a sealing ring 52a retained in place by the flange 86a of the bonnet member 84a. Associated with the bonnet member 84a is a retaining ring 92a and spring washer 90a for retaining the insert assembly 14a in place. Referring specifically to Fig. 4 of the drawing, the insert assembly 14a can be clearly seen and includes a generally cylindrical insert member 56a formed with a reduced diameter portion 57a at one end that is received in the discharge opening 42a at the end face 24a. Thus, a bearing surface is provided that retains the sealing ring 46a in place. The insert member 56a is formed at its other end with a radially extending flange 58a formed with a plurality of inlet passages 62a extending therethrough such that the passageways communicate with the chamber 33a and, thus, the passageway 32a as best seen in Fig. 3.Extending centrally through the insert member 56a is the discharge passageway 64a that communicates with the discharge passageway 42a permitting the discharge of fluid from the inlet passageways 62a across a valve surface formed at the upper end of the discharge passageway 64a through that passageway to the passageway 42a. Completing the insert assembly 14a there is a hatshaped housing member 68a having a central recessed portion 70a and a radial flange 72a that is in bearing relationship with the flange 58a on the insert member 56a. Diaphragm means 74a is clamped between the flanges 58a and 72a so that a control chamber 80a is provided between the recessed portion 70a and one side of the diaphragm means 74a. Inside the control chamber 80a is a pill shaped block of porous material 82a, metal or ceramic, which is saturated with a control fluid in a manner similar to the pill 80 described in Figs. 1 and 2. The diaphragm means 74a includes a first flexible metal diaphragm 76a and a second flexible, annular diaphragm 78a, both diaphragms being the same as diaphragms 76 and 78. Operation of the steam trap 10a is the same as that of steam trap 10. That is, the control fluid in control chamber 80a is sensitive to the temperature of fluid on the inlet side of the trap being in heat exchange relationship with that fluid located in passageways 62a and in chamber 33a. If the temperature indicates the fluid is in a liquid state, diaphragm means 74a is open allowing the discharge of the condensate and gases.On the other hand, if the temperature vaporizes the control fluid, the pressure in the control chamber 80a closes the diaphragm means 74a and retains it in its closed position until the temperature drops allowing the vapor to condense. The diaphragm 78a similarly operates as a check valve if there is a backsurge of pressure from the discharge side of the trap. The embodiment illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 has the same advantages explained with respect to the embodiment ofFigs. 1 and 2. In addition, the fluid on the inlet side of the trap is located in the chamber 33a and surrounds the upper housing member 68a as well as the diaphragm areas over the inlet passageways 62a so that a larger heat transfer path from the inlet fluid to the control fluid is provided. While in the foregoing there has been described several preferred embodiments of the invention, it should be understood that various changes and modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the invention as recited in the appended claims.
