# Image processing system.

## Abstract
An area designating memory 22 for storing a bit pattern representing a picture designating area used for image processing, and a video memory 11 for storing an image to be image processed in a form of digital picture element data are provided in an image processing system. In synchronism with picture element address signals 13, 14 sequentially generated by an address generating circuit 16 , corresponding picture element data is read from the video memory, and also, corresponding area designating bits are sequentially read from the area designating memory. The read picture element data and associated area designating bit are applied to a logic arithmetic circuit 36 , and the read picture element data is selectively gated depending on the status of the area designating bit. The video memory 11 and area designating memory 22 may be read written by an external processor 100 . By manipulating a video signal switching circuit 7 , the digitized video signal is directly gated depending on the status of the area designating bit read from the area designating memory 22 , and thus the processed image signal can also be obtained without the video memory.
