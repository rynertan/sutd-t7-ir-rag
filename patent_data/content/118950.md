# Teletext device with reduced page access time.

## Abstract
Arrangement for receiving and processing digital signals in teletext or associated systems, comprising a picture store and a background store, the background store being arranged immediately after the source for the digital input signals such that output signals of the background store can be applied to the customary input circuit for further proces sing, whilst the picture store is arranged after this input circuit. The background store can store at least two but preferably a larger number of pages. Because of this implementation the waiting times occur ring when new pages are requested are reduced to zero or substantially zero after the first request, whilst no additional control actions by the user are required.
