# Semipermeable membranes prepared from polymers containing pendant sulfone groups.

## Abstract
Semipermeable membranes useful for separating gaseous mixtures of carbon dioxide and methane into enriched fractions of each are prepared from at least one polymer containing a preponderance of arylene units, such as polyxylene oxide, the arylene units containing pendant sulfone groups substituted with an aromatic group, such as phenyl.
