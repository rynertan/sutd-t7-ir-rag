# Method and apparatus for drying particulate material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for drying particulate material includes an elongate housing 2 having a chamber 11 therein. A drum 3 is positioned in the housing 2 and has opposite ends thereof extending through open ends of the housing. The drum 3 is mounted for rotation about its longitudinal axis. The exterior surface of the drum 3 and the interior surface of the housing 2 are spaced apart and form an annular space 11 adapted for flow of heating medium therealong. An inlet 8 opens into the annular space 11 and is directed for introducing heating medium in a generally tangential direction relative to the annular space 11 such that the heating medium flows in a generally vortex manner along the length of the annular space 11 to the outlet 9 . A tube 30 is positioned in the drum 3 and extenas along a major portion of the length of the drum. The tube 30 is in flow communication with the annular space 11 for receiving heating medium therefrom. The heating medium flows along the tube 30 for heating the particulate material in the drum 3 and the heating medium in the tube 30 is discharged into the interior of the drum 3 for direct contact with the particulate material and further heating thereof. The material to be dried is introduced into one end 20 of the drum 3 and discharged from the other end 24 of the drum 3 after drying.
