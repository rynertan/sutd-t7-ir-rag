# STACK PACK ELECTROLYTIC CELL

## Abstract
A stack pack type of electrolytic cell, suitable for the gen eration of chlorates or hypochlorites of sodium or potas sium, is disclosed. Such materials are useful for the treat ment of water effluents, but varying demand raises problems which known production apparatus cannot deal with. The cell 10 of the invention has the ability to make economical use of materials, while eliminating the necessity for large external studs for the electrode components, housings to retain fluids and intercell piping connections, since the cell can easily be increased or reduced in capacity by adding or removing chambers and electrode stack packs to or from the cell itself or by adding or removing electrodes to or from the stack packs. The electrolytic cell proposed can utilize mass produced components and can be assembled either in a monopolar or bipolar configuration, so as to make most effi cient use of existing electrical supply equipment. Between end plates 12 , chamber sections 22 alternate with elec trode stack packs 24, 26, 38 to form the cell 10 and these units are compressed by tie rods 16 which engage cross members 14 in contact with the end plates 12 .
