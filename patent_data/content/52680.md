## Description
Improvements relating to Electrical Switch Devices This invention relates to switch devices having reed switches, such for example as those used for starting and stopping a pump to control the levels of liquids in tanks or other containers, or in open water such as the sea or a loch to control an electrical device for providing an indication of, or a warning with regard to such levels. Other switches used for such purposes, such as mercury switches or pressure switches are not entirely reliable for many reasons and are expensive, and have been found to be inaccurate and variable in action to a wide degree, Existing reed switches are cheap, highly reliable and accurate, but have such a small differential between the switch being activated to the on position and de activated to the off position, or vice versa, that they can be used to detect only a very small change in liquid level. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide means whereby a float operated switch or float switch can detect greater differences in liquid levels than is possible with existing float operated reed switches. According to the present invention there is provided a switch device comprising a reed switch, a first float, a magnet carried by said float for activating said reed switch in accordance with the level of the float and magnet relative to the reed switch in which there is provided a second float vertically. spaced from the first float for holding the first float against movement i .the.direction for activating the reed switch when the liquid level changes and until the liquid level is such that the level of the second float changes to a predetermined level, whereby the differential between the reed switch being open or closed is increased. As a result of the invention, the differential between the closed and open conditions may be extended by any given amount without interference to the switching mechanism of a standard production reed switch, and its on off settings can be predetermined, or extended as required. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows one embodiment of a switch device for operating a bilge pump and having testing gear as disclosed in my Patent Application No. 38307 77, and Figs. 2 and 3 show second and third embodiments. Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, 1 is a container of any suitable shape and size in which a plurality of holes 2 are provided. Within the container 1, there is a container 3 of any suitable shape and size and on which is fitted a reed switch 4 to be activated by a magnet 5 carried by a float 6 within the container 3. At least one hole 7 is provided in the container 3 for the inlet and outlet of water and a hole 8 is provided in the base of the container 3 through which a push rod 9 can slide and project at its upper end into the container 3. A boss 10 or other guide is provided on the base of the container 1, in which a lower end portion of the push rod 9 locates, rests and slides. The rod 9 has secured to it a float 11. A height adjustable governor 9A, which may be a nut, is provided to control the height to which the push rod 9 can rise, or the float 11 may be so situated on the push rod 9 that it acts as a stop when it rises to the base of the container 3. The container 1 is placed in the bilges of a boat, and the operation is as follows. When the water level in the bilges rises sufficiently, the water flows into the container 1, by way of the holes 2, eventually raising the float 11 and the push rod 9 to its full governed extent. By this time, the float 6 has been raised by the rod 9 sufficiently to have passed beyond the lower activating point of the switch 4, at which the switch is open, but not sufficiently to have reached the higher activating point at which the switch closes. A further rise in the water level causes the water to enter the smaller container 3 through the holes 7 or over its open top, and this causes the float 6 to rise, and so the switch 4 closes by the effect of the magnet 5. On the liquid level lowering, the reverse takes place but the float 6 can only lower on to the top of the rod 9, and is maintained there until the level of the water lowers sufficiently to allow the float 11 to lower. When the float 11 lowers, the rod 9 also lowers and so allows the float 6 to lower so that the switch 4 is opened. When the switch 4 is closed, the bilge pump operates to remove water from the bilges, but because of the float 11 and the rod 9, does not switch off for a period which is considerably greater than is at present possible with float operated reed switches. The switch device may be used for detecting the levels of other liquids in other circumstances, and the switch device may be used to control an audible or visual warning device. The switch device, and the bilge pump, or other device which it controls, can be tested by introducing water manually into the container 3 to raise the float 6, or by feeding water into the latter from the bilges or from the container 1 by means of a small electrical, mechanical or manual pump the water subsequently draining through the holes 7 to the container 1 and allowing the float 6 to lower, so cutting off the current flow by the way of the reed switch. All parts, i.e. the float 6, the switch 4, and the warning device or the bilge pump, are thus easily tested. When the switch device is used to control a bilge pump, a switching differential of only 2 , or thereby, is sufficient, but the switch differential can be predetermined or altered externally and without modification to the switch, to extend the differential by many inches, or even feet or yards if so desired. The switch device could therefore be used in, for example, a very large holding tank to keep a liquid height between any two predetermined levels. The embodiment shown in Fig. 2 is similar to that above described, and like parts are indicated by like numerals with the suffix B. In Fig. 2, the main difference is that the float 6 and the casing of the switch 4B together form a unit, the float 6B being pivotal relative to said casing which is secured to the containers 1B and 3B. Various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the push rod 9 and the float 6 may be replaced by a hollow floatable rod, and its action may be used above the float 6 instead of under it as shown, in which case the action and delay would be similar but reversed. Thus, for space reasons or because it is required to have the float 6 mounted as low as possible, it might be necessary to raise the float 6 to the desired position, by a float above the latter. This can be done by having the float 11 attached by the rod 9 to the top of the float 6 and its raising height governed. The action would be the same but the liquid could rise, as. desired to many inches or even feet above the float 6, and could control the action of the float 6 from such a position, i.e. the weight of the float and its push rod would hold the float 6 down in the intermediate position and stop it closing the reed until the upper float 11, was raised by the liquid. The container 1 may be omitted, and it is possible for the switch 4 to be carried by the float 6 and for the magnet 5 to be carried by the container 3 in Fig. 1. It is to be noted that, whilst the examples given concern only float switches operated by reeds and magnets, the device could be used for any other purpose where it is necessary to have a reed operated electrical make andbreak contact switch with an externally adjustable differential, or where it is desired that the differential is greater than that at present available in existing reed and magnet switches. That is to say the invention can be used instead of an electrical delay device, which is relatively expensive. The embodiment shown in Fig. 3 will now be described. The switch device is located within a closed container 15 having an inlet 16 for liquid, and an outlet 17 through which liquid is withdrawn by a pump not shown . The switch device consists generally of a tube 18 which is secured at its lower end to the base of the container 15, an upper annular float 19, a lower annular float 20, and a sleeve 21 located between the floats 19 and 20, the floats and the sleeve being vertically slideable on the tube 18. Two reed switches 22, 23 are fitted within the tube 18 one above the other at predetermined levels, and the float 19 carries a permanent magnet 24 which creates a magnetic field extending across the tube 18. The tube 18 has upper and lower stops 25, 26 in the form of flanges for limiting movement of the float 20, and a stop 27 at its upper end for limiting upward movement of the float 19 to a predetermined height. The tube 18 is also closed at its upper end. The switch device operates as follows. If the level of liquid in the container 15 lowers to a predetermined height the float 19 lowers to a position in which the proximity of the magnet 24 closes or opens as desired the reed switch 22 to close or open an electric circuit. If the liquid level lowers further, the float 19 lowers on to the sleeve 21 which is held in a predetermined position by the lower float 20, which itself is held in position by its floatability in the liquid, against the stop 25 on the tube 18. At this point, the magnetic force from the magnet 24 is still within the range of the reed switch 22 and maintains its position open or closed as desired . If the liquid level drops still further to a lower predetermined height, the lower float 20 lowers allowing the sleeve 21 and the float 19 to lower. The magnet 24 in the float 19 thus activates the lower reed switch 23 to open or close another electric circuit as desired. The lower stop 26 on the tube 18 is positioned so that the lower float 20 can be arrested in its fall at a predetermined height, at which height both reed switches are still within the magnetic power of the magnet 24 in the float 19 and both activated to the closed, or open, or one closed and one open, position, as may be desired. The sleeve 21 around the tube 18 is held centralised by flanges 28 on the tube 18. The embodiment described with reference to Fig. 3 is especially suitable for use as an air bleeding device in the fuel supply system of a fuel injection engine. The container 15 is therefore provided with an air bleed valve 29 shown diagrammatically on its top wall, and a valve control member 30. The latter consists of a cap which can rest on the upper end of tube 18 when the float 19 has lowered and the valve 29 is open, and is pushed upwards by the float 19, when the latter rises, to effect closing of the valve 29. For this purpose, the cap 30 has a spigot 31 for engaging the movable member of the valve. The reed switch 22 is connected into the circuit of an electrical warning device, and the reed switch 23 is connected into a circuit controlling the fuel withdrawal pump. The air bleeding device operates in a manner generally similar to the air bleeding device disclosed in BritishPatent No. 1521750, the present switch device replacing in that Patent the pivotal float, the follower member, and the lower outlet valve and its associated parts. In a modification of the Fig. 3 embodiment, the flanges 25 and 26 on the tube 18 may be replaced by baffle plates which act as stops and extend across the container 15 and have a number of through apertures.
