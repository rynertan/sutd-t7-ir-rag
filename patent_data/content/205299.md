## Description
ISATIN DERIVATIVES, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME, AND THE USE THEREOF FOR ULCER DISEASES. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel isatin compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More particularly, this invention relates to isatin compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having anti ulcer activities for prophylaxis and treatment of ulcer diseases, to a method for prophylaxis and treatment of ulcer diseases using said isatin compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and to a pharmaceutical composition for prophylaxis and treatment of ulcer diseases containing on o of the said isatin compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as active ingredients. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In recent years, the accepted treatment for ulcer diseases in the digestive tract has depended upon drugs such as antacids which neutralize gastric acid, anticholinergics and histamine H2 receptor antagonists which reduce acid secretion in the stomach, and a drug such as sucralfate which increases the rate of healing of ulcer diseases but does not inhibit gastric acid secretion. The latter compound may have cytoprotective mucoprotective effects similar to the prostaglandins and prostaglandin analogs. However, in stomach and duodenum ulcer diseases induced by stress, which are on increase in recent years, a breakdown of the defensive system of the gastric and duodenal tract can be frequently observed. As a result of extensive studies of the type of compounds which are useful for prophylaxis and treatment of restraint and water immersion stress ulcers, it was found that the novel isatin compounds of this invention exhibit anti ulcer activities which are useful for prophylaxis of stress induced ulcers caused by restraint and water imnersion in Wister strain rats. Furthermore, the isatin compounds of this invention have curing effects for acetic acid induced ulcer diseases, and thus are useful for treatment of chronic ulcer diseases. The isatin compounds of this invention have prophylactic effects for hydrochloric acid or ethanolinduced gastric mucasal lesions. These findings demonstrate that the isatin compounds of this invention have cytoprotective activities and are useful for prophylaxis and treatment of ulcer diseases. The isatin compounds of this invention inhibit gastric acid ecretion induced by administrating 2deoxy D glucose but do not inhibit gastric acid secretion induced by administrating histamine, carbachol or pentagastrin. These results demonstrate that the novel isatin compounds have gastric acid secretion activities due to certain central nervous system activities. However, the isatin compounds of this invention do not prolong sleeping time or exhibit an inhibition of motor activities. Thus, the isatin compounds of this invention have anti ulcer activities with central nervous depressant activities. Isatin 3 semicarbazone derivatives such as isatin 3 semicarbazone, l methylisatin 3 semicarbazone, 1benzylisatin 3 semicarbazone and isatin 3 4 amino alkylsemicarbazones are disclosed in Chem. Rev., Vol. 44, 393 1944 , Chem. Abstr., Vol. 43, 8979g 1949 ,Chem. Abstr., Vol. 45, 8005g 1951 , Chem. Abstr.,Vol, 47, 5542f 1953 , Chem. Abstr., Vol. 73, 76977b 1970 and Chem. Abstr., Vol. 77, 152122u 1972 .However, these reference articles do not indicate any pharmacological effects associated with these disclosed isatin 3 semicarbazone derivalives. On the other hand, with regard to l dialkylamino alkylisatin 3 thiosemicarbazones, many compounds are disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,374,234, Sci. Pharm., Vol, 38, 98 1970 , J. Med. Chem., Vol. 10, 972 1967 , J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 68, 459 1979 ,Arzneim. Forsch., Vol. 30, 1839 1980 and Chim.Ther., Vol. 8, 447 1973 . These reference articles disclose that these compounds have pharmacological effects such as antiviral, antibacterial or antifungal effect, and are useful as therapeutic agents. Specifically, United States Patent No. 3,374,234 above discloses isatin 3 thiosemicarbazones represented by the general formula EMI4.1 wherein Alk represents an alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and Z represents an amino group, and indicates that these compounds have pharmacological effects such as antiviral, antibacterial, central stimulating, antihistaminic or analgesic agents, and are useful for therapeutic agents. With regard to the physical properties of isatin 3 semicarbazones and isatin 3 thiosemicarbazones, Thompson et al. have reported in Chem. Abstr., Vol.47, 5542f 19 3 that antiviral activities of isatin 3 thiosemicarbazones are not found in isatin 3 semicarbazones. Furthermore, Tomchin et al. have reported in Chem. Abstr., Vol. 79, 41782f, 91459b 1973 andVol. 81, 37145z 1974 that isatin 3 thiosemicarbazones exist predominantly in the Z form and isatin 3 semicarbazones are mainly in the E form and that the isatin 3 semicarbazones in the E form can be isomerized to the Z form by heating or treating with an acid.These facts demonstrate that isatin 3 semica bazones and isatin 3 thiosemicarbazones exhibit different physical properties. SU.wEARY OF THE INVENTION An object of this invention is to provide novel isatin compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having anti ulcer activities.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Novel isatin compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention possess anti ulcer activities and are useful as propylactic and treating agents for ulcer diseases in the digestive tract, such as ulcer diseases in the stomach and the duodenum of mammals. The isatin compounds represented by the general formula I of the present invention can be prepared in accordance with known procedures. A general method for synthesizing isatin compounds of this invention corresponding to the general formula I EMI8.1 involves reacting a compound represented by the general formula II EMI8.2 where R, R2, R3, n and Y are as previously defined, with a semicarbazide derivative represented by the general formula III H2NNHCONHR1 III where R1 is as previously defined, or with its acid salt. Isatin compounds represented by the general formula I of this invention, where R1 is an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or cycloalkyl group, can be prepared also by reacting a present invention compound having an RÃš hydrogen atom with an amino compound represented by the general formula IV NH2R4 IV where R4 represents an alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or a cycloalkyl group. The reaction of a compound represented by the general formula II with a semicarbazide compound represented by the general formula III or its acid salt can be accomplished in accordance with the following procedure. A compound of the general formula II is dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as aqueous alcohol, and to the solution is added a semicarbazide compound of the general formula III or its acid salt in an equimolar amount or in a slight excess amount relative to the compound of the general formula II , and then, if required sodium acetate, acetic acid or hydrochloric acid is added to the reaction mixture. The reaction is conducted for a period of about 1 40 hours at a temperature of about 00 80 C. After completion of the reaction, a precipitate is formed by concentrating of the reaction mixture, or by adding an aqueous basic solution such as an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution or an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to the residue after concentration of the reaction mixture.The precipitate is collected by filtration, and purified with silica gel column chromatography and or recrystallized from an adequate solvent to provide an isatin compound of the general formula I . The compounds represented by the general formula II employed as starting materials of this invention can be prepared by reacting a compound corresponding to the general formula V EMI10.1 where R and n are as previously defined, with a compound corresponding to the general formula VI EMI10.2 where X is an acid residual group such as halogen, andR2, R3 and Y defined or by reacting compound V with the corresponding acid salt of compound VI . Alternatively, the compound represented by the general formula II can be prepared by reacting a compound corresponding to the general formula VII EMI11.1 where R, n, X and Y are as previously defined, with an amino compound corresponding to the general formula VIII EMI11.2 where R2 and R3 are as previously defined, above, and said amine is employed in an equimolar amount or an excess amount to the compound of the general formula VII in the usual manner. Some of the compounds of the general formulae III , IV , V , VI , VII and VIII are known compounds, and can be purchased or can be prepared by methods described in the literature. The isatin compounds represented by the general formula I can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts by conventional means. For example, a hydrochloric acid salt can be prepared by dissolving an isatin compound of general formula I in methanol, adding a 1N hydrochloric acid in an equimolar amount or a slight excess amount to the isatin compound to the solution, concentrating the reaction mixture, adding diethyl ether to the residue to form a precipitate, collecting the precipitates by filtration, and then recrystallizing the precipitates from a suitable solvent.Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable salts include pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acid salts such as a sulfuric acid salt, a ptoluenesulfonic acid salt, an acetic acid salt, a citric acid salt, a tartaric acid salt, a malic acid salt, a fumaric acid salt, and the like. These salts have anti ulcer effects as high as the corresponding formula I compounds having a free amino group. The isatin compounds of the general formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof possess strong anti ulcer activities for prophylaxis and treatment of ulcer diseases in some experimental ulcer diseases, i.e., restraint and water immersion stress induced, acetic acid induced and aspirin induced ulcers in animals, and ethanol induced and hydrochloric acid induced mucosal lesions in animals.For example, these isatin compounds are effective for reducing the restraint and water immersion stressinduced ulcer to a degree between about 40 955 as compared with a control, as determined by the length of the ulcer at a dose of 100 mg per kg of body weight by oral administration. Also, the anti ulcer activities of the isatin compounds of this invention at a dose of 100 mg kg, e.g., E 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl isatin 3 semicarbazone, is approximately equivalent to that of cimetidine at a dose of 100 mg kg in acetic acidinduced ulcer by oral administration. The isatin compounds of the general formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts have two geometrical isomers, i.e., E form and Z form, which can be employed individually or as a mixture in the practice of the present invention. Preferred isatin compounds of the general formula I of this invention include E l 2 diisopropyl aminoethyl isatin 3 semicarbazone, E i 2 diiso propylaminoethyl isatin 3 4 methylsemicarbazone , E 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl isatin 3 4 benzylsemicarbazone , E 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl isatin 3 4 cyclohexylsemicarbazone , E 1 2 diisopropyl aminoethyl 5 fluoroisatin 3 semicarbazone, E 5chloro 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl isatin 3 semicarbazone, E 5 bromo 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl isatin 3 semicarbazone, E 1 2 diisopropylamino ethyl 5 methylisatin 3 semicarbazone, Z 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl 7 methoxycarbonylisatin 3semicarbazone, E 1 2 N isopropylcyclohexylamino ethyl isatin 3 semicarbazone and the corresponding acid salts. A particularly preferred compound is E 1 2 diisopropylaminoethyl isatin 3 semicarbazone. The isatin compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered to humans and other mammalia by oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrarectal administration, and for administration the isatin compounds can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The isatin compounds and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of formula I can be administered in various dosage forms depending upon the intended therapy. Typical dosage forms which can be utilized are tablets, pills, powders, liquid preparations, suspensions, emulsions, granules, capsules, suppositories, and injections. For molding a pharmaceutical composition into tablet form, a wide variety of conventional carriers known in the art can be used Examples of suitable carriers are excipients such as glucose, lactose, starch, cacao butter, hardened vegetable oils, kaolin and talc, binders such as gum arabic powder, tragacanth powder, and ethanol, and disintegrants such as laminaria and agar. If desired the tablets can be coated with one or more layers of sugar or gelatin or other type of coating. When a pharmaceutical composition is formulated into an injectable preparation, it is preferred that the resulting injectable solution and suspension are sterilized and rendered isotonic with respect to blood. In formulating a pharmaceutical composition in the form of a solution or suspension, any diluent customarily used in the art can be employed. Examples of suitable diluents include water, ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, and the like. Sodium chloride, glucose or glycerol may be incorporated into a liquid preparation in an amount sufficient to prepare an isotonic solution. The therapeutic agent may further contain ordinary dissolving aids, buffers, pain alleviating agents, and preservatives, and optionally, coloring agents, fragrances, flavors, sweeteners, and other pharma cologically active agents which are known in the art. The dosage of an isatin compound of this invention can be in a range of about 10 5,000 mg per adult human per day by oral administration, or about 1 1000 mg per adult human per day by parenteral administration, in multiple doses depending upon the type of disease, the severity of condition to be treated, and the like.
