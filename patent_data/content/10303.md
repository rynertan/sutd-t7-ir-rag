## Description
SIGNAL CONDITIONER Background of the Invention Second harmonic, saturable core, angular transducers are well known and have found widespread use particularly in the aircraft instrumentation field for providing a remote indication of the position of a rotatable shaft or some related quantity. Such transducers are generally used in pairs and in situations where they can be driven by a common excitation signal. In the usual installation, one transducer of the pair is used as a transmitter and the other as a receiver. The transmitter is coupled to a rotatable shaft and the receiver is coupled to some pe of rotating pointer or indicator so that any change in the angular position of the shaft at the transmitter will result in a corresponding change in the position of the pointer or indicator.One particular application where such transducers have been used is in the provision to the cockpit crew of a visual indication of the rate of fuel flow to an aircraft engine. Such transducers are already in place on many commercial aircraft presently in use. With increases in the cost of aircraft fuel and an increased desire to conserve such fuel, itrcas become desirable to acquire information concerning the rate of fuel flow to aircraft engines in a form such that the information can both be further processed or analyzed and recorded using conveniently available recording apparatus.For example, the fuel flow information might be combined with airspeed information to yield an indication to the cockpit cre of the present miles or knots per gallon or pound of fuel burned. Alternatively, the data acquired might be recorded along with numerous other features of interest such as altitude, attitude, outside air temperature, etc., sc t r. the data may be subsequently analyzed an compared with t developed at different times during the s me flight, on different flights of the same aircraft, o flights by different aircraft, etc., to develop and optimize varies flight procedures and operations.It is highly desira e, of course, that the necessary information be acquired as inexpensively as possible and, in particular, it is desirable that the data be acquired using instrumentation which is already in place and operational on the aircraft. Accordingly, there are provided by this invention signal conditioner circuits for coupling to second harmonic, saturable core, angular transducers which circuits transform the alternating current signals provided by the transducers into direct current signals containing information required to determine the angular position of the transducer. The circuits include bandpass filters for selecting from the transducer outputs the signal components at twice the frequency of the signal driving the transducer and phase sensitive detection circuits to detect the amplitude of the double frequency signals at times fixed with respect to the phase of the signal exciting the transducer. It is an object of this invention to provide a signal conditioner circuit useful with pre existing second harmonic, saturable core, angular transducers for converting the transducer output signa.ls into direct current signals including tWhe Anformation required to determine the angular position of the transducer. It is an object of this invention to provide signal conditioner circuits useful with pre existing second harmonic, saturable core, angular transducers for converting the information contained in the signals generated thereby into a form which may be conveniently further processed ort analyzed with additional circuits and or may be conve niently recorded using known data recording apparatus. It is an object of this invention to provide such signal conditioner circuits which will operate reliably in an aircraft environment. It is an object of this invention to provide such signal conditioner circuits capable of providing highly accurate results. It 15 an object of this invention to provide such signal conditioner circuits which are of relatively simple design and economical to construct, install, and operate. Description of the Drawing Figure 1 is a drawing in schematic form of a signal conditioner circuit of this invention draw in two parts, Figs. 1A and 1B, with the lines represented by the same reference numbers being connected together and Fig. 2 is a graphical representation for use in e plalning the operation of the signal conditioner circuit of Fig. 1. Description of the Preferred Embodiment There is disclosed in the drawing a signal conditioner circuit making use of this invention for transforming the signals generated by a second harmonic, saturable core, angular transducer into two direct current signals containing information giving the angular position of the transducer which signals may be recorded and or further processed to give a direct reading of said angular position. The disclosed signal conditioner is used with a transducer driven by a 400 Hertz signal such as is commonly found on aircraft and to provide an indication of such quantities as the rate of fuel flow to an aircraft engine.While only one particular signal conditioner of this invention is disclosed, it will be understood that the invention is not limited thereto but is instead to be measured by the claims which are appended to the end of this description and form a part of this specification. A second harmonic, saturable care angular transducer is indicated generally at 10 in the drawing. The transducer 10 used with the signal conditioner disclosed in the drawing was one sold by General Electric Company in its TJ50 transduce series, specifically, one sold under the number 8TJ50GB3. Similar transducers Ire also known by . name Magnesyn . M,agnesyn is registered as a trademark Bendix Aviation Corporation.The transducer 10 includes a toroidal core 12 of magnetically saturable material with a single helical wire winding 14 wrapped about the core over practically its entire circumferance. The winding is connected to an excitation source 16, a source of 400 Hertz s ne wave signal having one terminal thereof coupled to a circuit ground. Two taps are provided at positions located one third and two thirds of the way around core 12 from the extremeties of winding 14 and effectively divide that winding into three sections, the three sections being designated in the drawing as A, B, and C. A generally flat magnet 18, which may be either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet excited by a source of direct current, is located in the plane of the core 12 and is mounted for rotation about a center point 20.The magnet 18 is mechanically connected so that its angular position varies in response to a parameter to be measured and it is that angular position which is detected by the transducer 10. In the apparatus for which the signal conditioner of the drawing was specifically designed, the magnet 18 was mechanically coupled to the output shaft of a spring actuated fuel flow meter located in an aircraft fuel line so that the angular position of the magnet varied in response to the rate of fuel flow through the meter. In the conventional and well known use of second harmonic, saturable core transducers, a second transducer constructed like transducer 10 is connected to the same excitation source 16 and the taps on the second transducer are connected to the similarly located taps on transducer 10. The magnet included within the second transducer will then assume an angular position which corresponds to that of the magnet 18 in the first transducer and variations in the angular position of magnet 18 will cause similar variations in the angular position of the magnet in the second transducer. The magnet of the second transducer is. then commonly connected to a pointer which is read against an appropriate scale by the operator to yield a reading of the quantity being measured.Such operation is discussed, for example, in Childs, Magnesyn Remote Indication , Transactions of theAmerican Institute of Electrical Engineers,vol. 63, September 28, 1944 which is incorporated herein by reference.However, such operation is not suitable when it is desired to maintain a permanent and continuous record of the parameter being measured by the transducer or when it desired to make further use of the information obtained concerning the parameter being measured. The signal conditioner 30 of the drawing converts the signals generated by the transducer 10 into d.c. signals which may easily be recorded by conventional data recording equipment, which may be further analyzed to develop an output directly representative of the quantity being measured, and which may be conveniently used as inputs to additional electrical equipment. The signal conditioner 30 of the drawing includes first and second signal inputs 32 and 34 each coupled to one of the taps on the transducer coil and a reference input 36 coupled to the ungrounded side of excitation source 16. The signal at the reference input 36 is amplified by an amplifier circuit 38 which comprises an operational amplifier 40. The input 36 is coupled through a resistor 42 to the inverting input of that amplifier while the noninverting input thereof is coupled to ground through a resistor 44. A feedback resistor 46 is connected from the output of amplifier 40 to the inverting input thereof and that some input has a pair of back to back diodes 48 and 50 connected between it and ground.The signal at the second signal input 34 is amplified by an amplifier circuit 52 comprising an operational amplifier 54, resistors 56, 58, and 66, and back to back diodes 62 and 64 connected together as in ar.p ifier circuit 38. The signal at the first sinal input 32 Is amplified by a summer amplifier circuit 66 comprising an operational amplifier 68, resistors 70, 72, and 74, and back to back diodes 76 and 78 also connected together an amplifier circuit 38. The summer amplifier circuit 66 additionally includes a resistor 79 coupling the c tput of operational amplifier 40 to the inverting input o an operational amplifier 8. The output of opera onal amplifier 54 is coupled to another amplifier circuit 80 mprising an operational amplifier 82.The output of amplifier 54 is coupled through a resistor 84 t the inverting input of an operational amplifier 82 and a feedback resistor 86 is coupled between the output and the inverting input of that amplifier. The output of operational amplifier 40 is coupled to the noninverting input of amplifier 82 through a resistor 88 and that same input has a resistor 90 connected from it to ground. The outputs of amplifiers 68 and 82 are coupled through 800 Hertz bandpass filters 92 and 94 to the inputs of samplers 96 and 98, respectively, and the same per outputs are coupled through buffer amplifiers 100 and 102 to outputs 104 and 106, respectively. Bandpass filter 92 includes a resistor 1o8 coupling the output of amplifier 68 to a circuit point 110 and a capacitor 112 coupling that circuit point to the inverting input ofan operational amplifier 114. A feedback resistor 116 is connected between the output of amplifier 114 and the inverting input thereof and a feedback capacitor 118 is coupled from that same output to circuit point 110.The noninverting input of operatioral amplifier 114 is connectedçdire c tly to ground and circuit point 110 is connected to ground through a resistor 120.Bandpass filter 94 includes resistors 122, 130, and 134, circuit point 124, capacitors 126 and 132, and an operational amplifier 128 connected together in the same manner as in the bandpass filter 92. Sampler 96 comprises a switch element 136 having its input coupled to the output of operational amplifier 114. Switch element 136 is one otput circuit of an analog switch circuit 138. The output cw switch element 136 is coupled through a resistor 140 to or. terminal of a capacitor 142 having its other terminal coupled to ground. The junction of resistor 140 and capa citor 142 is coupled to the noninverting input of an operaticra1 amplifier 144 included within buffer amplifier 100. The output of operational amplifier 144 is connected directly tc the diverting input thereof and through the series co bint icon of a resistor 146 and a potentiometer 148 to grout.The tap of potentiometer 14tri is coupled through a resistor 150 to output 104. The sampler 98 and buffer amplifier 102 include a switch element 152 which is another output element of analog switch 138, resistors 154, 160, and 164, capacitor 156, operational amplifier 158, and potentiometer 162 connected together in the same manner as in sampler 96 and buffer amplifier 100. The analog switch 138 is driven by a signal whose timing is fixed with respect to the signal at the reference signal input 36. The output of amplifier circuit 38 is filtered by a 400 Hertz bandpass filter 170 and applied through a phase shift circuit 171 to a zero crossing detector 172, and the output of zero crossing detector 172 is used to trigger a one shot circuit 174 which, in turn, operates the analog switch circuit 138. The bandpass filter 170 includes resistors 176, 188, and 184, a circuit point 178, capacitors 180 and 186, and an operational amplifier 182 connected together in the same manner as in bandpass filters 92 and 94. The output of amplifier 182 is applied through a resistor 189 to a circuit point 190 in phase shift circuit 171. A capacitor 191 is coupled between circuit point 190 and ground. Circuit point 190 is coupled to the inverting input of an operational amplifier 192 and the noninverting input of an operational amplifier 194 in the zero crossing detector 172. The noninverting input of operational amplifier 192 and the inverting input of operational amplifier 194 are both connected directly to ground. The output of each of operational amplifiers 192 and 194 are coupled to the cathodes of diodes 19 DO, respectively, and the anodes of those two clones are coupled together at circuit point 202. A resistor 204 connected between circuit point 202 and ground.The output of the zero crossing detector 172 is taken froze circuit point 2G2 and coupled through the series combination c capacitor 206 and a resistor 208 to the ase of a transiste 210 included in the one shot circuit 174. The base of transistor 210 is coupled to the cathode of a diode 211 having its anode coupled to ground and the eritter of transistor 210 is coupled to ground. The collector of transistor 210 is coupled to a source of positive potential V through a load resistor 212. The collector of transistor 210 is coupled through a capacitor 214 to a circuit point 215. A resistor 216 is coupled between circuit point 215 and the source of positive potential V.A resistor 218 couples the signal at circuit point 215 to both the control inputs of a dual analog switch 220 included within analog switch circuit 138. The control inputs of analog switch 220 are also connected to the cathode of a diode 222 having its anode coupled to ground and to the anode of a diode 224 having its cathode coupled to the source of positive potential V. The appropriate supply inputs of analog switch 220 are also coupled to ground through a resistor 226, to the source of positive potential V through a resistor 228, to a source of negative potential V through resistor 230.A resistor 232 is connected from the reference input of analog switch 220 to the positive supply input thereof and sets the voltage level on the control inputs at wShich the switch 220 will change states. Each of operationalamplifiers 40, 54, 68, 82, 114, 128, 144, 158, 182, 192, and 194 must also be connected to appropriate positive and negative potential supply sources. The magnet 18 in the transducer 10 is effective to partially saturate the core 12 but the flux flow through the core is in opposite directions on opposite sides of the magnet. Thus, the 400 Hertz signal in winding 14 is effec tive to fully saturate opposite sides cf cor 12 dur positive going and negative geing half cycles with the result taht a signal at twice the frequency of that ci exc tation source 16, i.e., a signal at 00 ert, indued in each section of winding 14 ar. signals at this frequency are present at the two tapes on wincing 14. At any instant, the sum of the potentials of the double frequency signals across the three sections of winding 14 will be zero, of course. The relative magnitudes or the double frequency potentials across the individual winding sections will vary according to the angular position of magnet 18 as is explained in the aforementioned Childs reference, and the relative magnitudes of the potentials of the double frequency signals present at those taps will vary similarly. Each tap also has thereat a signal at the excitation frequency, the signal at one tap at any instant being at a potential of approximately one third of the excitation potential and the signal at the other tap being approximately two thrids of the excitation signal potential. The signal conditioner 30 is operative to produce at outputs 104 and 106 direct current potential signals which vary in magnitude according to the relative potential of the double frequency signals appearing at the taps on winding 14 of the transducer 10. The double frequency signals are effectively amplitude demodulated by sampling their relative values at times fixed with respect to the 400Hertz excitation signal. The apparatus disclosed in the drawing was designed for use with a transducer excited by a 400 Hertz signal at approximately 115 volts r.m.s. and produced at the two taps thereof signals of approximately 40 volts r.rn.s. and 65 volts r.m.s.Amplifier circuit 38 coupled to the excitation source 16 is effective to produce at its output a 400 Hertz signal at practically the same phase as the signal produced by the excitation source but reversed in polarity and scaled down to a voltage level which is more convenient to work with. Amplifier circuit 52 coupled to the tap on winding 14 which is closer to ground is similarly effective to produce at its output t signal present at that tap but inverted in polarity and scale5 d wn to a more convenient voltage level. zimmer amplifier circuit 66 is coupled to the tap on winding 14 which is zri removed from ground and performs the same function as amplifier circuit 52 but the 400 Hertz si 1 aplie thereto from the output of amplifier 40 i effective ca cel out a large portion of the 400 Hertz signal from the output of differential amplifier 68, and, thus, fro the output of bandpass filter 92. The back to back c ioes coupled to the inverting inputs of each of differential amplifiers 40, 54, and 68 protect those inputs from voltage extremes when power is being applied to or reroved fro r the system. Amplifier circuit 80 is effective to again invert in polarity and further scale the signal applied thereto from the output of operational amplifier 54.The 400 Hertz signal applied to the noninverting input of operational amplifier 82 is also effective to remove a large portion cf the 400 Hertz signal from the output of operational amplifier 82, and, thus, from the output of bandpass filter 92. The 800 Hertz bandpass filters coupled to the outputs of operational amplifiers 68 and 82 both further suppress the 400 Hertz signal components as well as any signal components above 800Hertz from the signals applied thereto and supplied to the samplers 96 and 98. The output of operational amplifier 40 is applied through the 400 Hertz bandpass filter 170 to the phase shift circuit 171, and thence to the zero crossing detector 172.The 400 Hertz bandpass filter 170 suppresses extraneous signals which might be present in the output of operational amplifier 40. Resistor 190 and capacitor 196 are operative to retard thephase of the signal applied to the ero crossing detector by approximately 450. The phase shift circuit 171 may also be used to compensate for slight phase variations introduced by the amplifier circuits. The zerocrossing detector 172 is essentially comprised of two very high gain amplifiers coupled in parallel.Whenever the signal applied to the input thereof is either very far aLo C or below ground, one of amplifiers 192 or 194 is effectie through the diode coupled to its output to maintain circuIt point 202 at the no active supply potential with diode 212 being operative to permit capacitor 206 to charge. Howe er, when the potential at the input zf the zero crossing detector approaches and passes through ziL o in either the positive or the negative going directions, neither of the outputs of differential amplifiers 192 and 194 are at the negative supply potential and circuit point 202 is effectively held at approximately ground potential by resistor 204 for a short period of time.A positive going pulse is thus applied to the base of transistor 210 as capacitor 206 discharges through resistor 208 and the base emitter junction of that transistor causing capacitor 214 to be coupled to ground through the collector emitter circuit of transistor 210. A negative going ground level pulse is thus generated at circuit point 215 the duration of which is determined by the rate at which capacitor 214 is charged through resistor 216. That pulse is applied to the input of analog switch 220 causing switch elements 136 and 152 to be closed for the duration thereof. Diodes 222 and 224 limit any transients appearing at the control inputs to the analog switch and prevent the potential at those inputs from becoming excessively positive or negative.The time constants of the circuits are chosen so that the switch elements 136 and 152 are closed for a period of approximately 100 usec at approximately 450 following the occurrance of each zero crossing of the 400 Hertz signal. The one shot circuit 174 is useful to adjust the pulses applied to analog switch 138 to the desired duration, but in some applications of this invention its use may not be necessary. Each time the switch elements 136 and 152 are closed, the outputs of operational amplifiers 114 and 128 are coupled through the associated ones of resistors 140 and 154 to capacitors 142 and 156, respectively, permitting the capacitors to either charge or discharge through the associated resistors to the potential at the outputs of e operational amplifiers.When the switch elements are oper the potentials across capacitors 142 and 156 rein essentially constant at the potentials to which they were charged during the most recent closure of the switch elements. Resistos 140 and 154 prevent the potentials across capacitcrs 2 42 156 from changing excessively rapidly during a single closure of the switch elements and, thus, filter cut high frequency noise when it is known that the physical quantity being sensed by the transducer 10 varies at a slow rate compared to the frequency at which sampling occurs. Buffer amplifiers 100 and 102 develop at outputs 104 and 106 potentials proportional to those across the respective one of capacitors 142 and 156.Potentiometers 146 and 160 permit adjustment of the overall gain of the signal conditioner 30. It will thus be seen that the signal conditioner 30 produces at its outputs 104 and 106 two direct current potential signals which vary in response to the relative magnitudes of the double frequency signals present at the taps of transducer 10. In Fig. 2 of the drawing there are shown three curves labelled EA, Eg, and EC which present the variations of the magnitudes of the double frequency signals present across the three sections A, B, and C of winding 14 with the relative angle B of magnet 18. The phases of each of those double frequency signals will, of course, be identical. Also shown in Fig. 2 is a dashed curve labelled EB EC which represents the variation of the magnitude of the sum of the double frequency signals present across sections B and C of winding 14. Each of the curves of Fig. 2 is a sine cosine function. The sum of the signals across windings B and C, of course, is applied to input 32 of the signal conditioner 30 and the signal across winding C is applied to input 34 of the signal conditioner 30.Once the signal conditioner is calibrated so that the maximum values of the signals at the outputs 104 and 106 are known for any angular position of the magnet 18, the signals at the outputs 104 and 106 can be further analyzed using the curves EC and E Ec to give a direct reading o the angular position of the magnet 10 and cr the physical quantity being measured. If in a particular application te rotation of magnet 18 is restricted to less than 1800, only one of the outputs is needed to determine its angular position.If the rotation of the magnet is not so restricted, , both outputs are necessary to resolve the ambiguity which would result with only one output. It is apparent that any pair of the signals across any one section of winding 14 or any two sections of that winding may be used instead of the signals shown in the drawing. The further analysis of the signals present at the outputs 104 and 106 may be done by further electrical circuitry of the digital or analog variety. Such circuitry may either be connected directly to outputs 104 and 106, or the signals at those outputs may be recorded such as on magnetic tape for analysis at a subsequent time. If the data is to be recorded, of course, only the signals at outputs 104 and 106 need be recorded. In the absence of signal conditioner 30, to preserve the data it would be necessary to record the 400 Hertz driving signal and the signals at both taps of the transducer and preserve the phase relationship therebetween. In one apparatus built in accord with the disclosure of the drawing, the listed components had the values or part identification numbers stated below 42, 56, 70 100 Kohm, 2 44, 72, 90 6.2 Kohm, 1 46, 58, 60, 84 4.75 Kohm, 1 74, 86 12.1 Kohm, 1 79 15 Kohm, 5 88 10 Xohm, 5 108, 122 19.6 Xohm, 1 112, 118, 126, 132, 180, 186 116, 130, 176 40 Nohm, 1 120, 134 100 ohm 140, 154 0.7 Kohm 142, 156 0.5 fd. 148, 162 1 Kohm 184 80 Kohm 188 200 ohm 191, 206 0.01 Ufd 204 4.7 Kohm 150, 164, 208 1 Kohm 212, 216 10 Kohm 214 0.012 fd 218 47 Kohm 226 228, 230 200 ohm, 5 232 22 Kohm, 5 48, 50, 62, 64, 76, 78, 198, 200, 211, 222, 224 1N914 210 2N2222A 40, 54, 68, 82, 114, 128, 182, 192, 194 LM741H 144, 158 Burr Brown 3540J 220 Siliconix DG 200Ak The positive and negative supply potentials were plus and minus 15 volts with respect to the circuit ground. The value for resistor.189 was selected to obtain operation of the analog switch circuit 138 at the correct phase of the 400 Hertz signal applied to the reference input 36. The elected value of resistor may vary ith such things as the alums of other components used in the circuit.A signal conditioner constructed in accord with Fig. 1 and using the Jove stated component values was accurate to approximate n half of one percent. It is apparent that many variations could be made in the circuitry shown in Fig. 1 for signal conditioner 3. One specific variation which is contemplated is the substitutio for zero crossing detector 172, one shot circuit 174, analog switch circuit 138, and samplers 96 and 98 of a single phase sensitive demodulator integrated circuit. Such an integrated circuit is available under the type number MN 2120 from Micronetwork Corporation, 324 Clerk Street, Worcester,Massachusetts. Further variations are also readily apparent. In some applications of this invention it might be found desirable to apply the output of amplifier circuit 38 to amplifier 52 to perform the cancellation of the 400 Hertz signal so that amplifier circuit 80 could be omitted. In some applications it might be found desirable to couple the inputs of bandpass filters 92 and 94 directly to the taps on winding 14 and the output of amplifier circuit 38 so that the bandpass filters would also perform both any voltage scaling required and the cancellation of the 400Hertz signal, thereby permitting the elimination of the separate amplifier circuits 52, 66, and 80. In some applications it may be acceptable to omit the 400 Hertz bandpass filter 170, while in others the functions of the 400 Hertz bandpass filter 170 and the phase shifter 171 might be combined into a single circuit.In some applications it might be found desirable to provide a single output point which is time multiplexed between a signal representative of the potential at one tap on winding 14 and a signal representative of the potential at the other tap. In such applications, the multiplexing operation might be performed at a point in the signal conditioner circuit either before or after the samplers 96 and 98 and the signals might be sampled at different phases e.g., 1350 and 315 with respect tc the 00 Hertz reference signal. The phase shift provided by pha shifter 171 could be made a leading shift rather than lagging.Further it might in some applications be found dsirable to eliminate phase shifter 71 and instead include circuitry for introducing appropriate phase shifts In the signal flr prior to samplers 96 any 98. It will thus be seen that a signal conditioner circuit has been provided which fulfills the above named objects no various modifications of that circuit have been suggested.It will be understood, cf course, that the invention is n t limited to the disclosed embodiment or the suggested modifications thereto. It is contemplated, therefore, b the appended claims to cover any such modification as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention.
