# Chaff ejection device.

## Abstract
A device for ejecting radar chaff comprising a maga zine having a number of tubular cells 1 in which chaff bundles 2 may be displaced towards an ejection end of the cell 1 . The displacement of said chaff bundles is ob tained by means of a plunger device 3 which is long tudinally movable in each cell 1 . Each of said plunger devices 3 is driven by means of a wire 4 running from an attachment point on said plunger device 3 in a path to the ejection end and therefrom to driving means 8 . Said wire 4 at the same time drives a knife element 10 . The knife edge of said knife element 10 performs a cut ting movement substantially longitudinally of the cell 1 , the cutting movement preferably being rotational and in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the chaff bundle.
