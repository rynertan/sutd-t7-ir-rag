# System for testing magnetic head disk interfaces.

## Abstract
Method for measuring the properties of a slider disk interface in a magnetic disk storage apparatus by mea suring a triboelectric current flowing between disk 1 and slider 6 . Rotational speed is adjusted between 100 and 500 rpm so as to obtain a frictional contact between disk and slider. The shape of the tribo current curve obtained during the measuring time interval is analyzed. An early maximum of the tribo current amplitude and a subsequent continual decay indicates a good slider disk interface and a long lifetime.
