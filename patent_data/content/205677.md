## Description
MEMORY DEVICE This invention relates to information storage and retrieval. It is an object of this invention to disclose a memory device which is capable of both read and write operations using light as a signal transmitter. The invention has two forms. In the first form of the invention the memory device is used for information of general purpose. It is applicable to computer memory and video disk. In the second form of the invention, the device is used to store pictures or visual images which can be viewed directly by human eyes. The first form of this invention is disclosed as follows The memory system comprises a storage medium, a read device, and a write device. Light is used to transmit signals between the storage medium and the read or the write device. The read device includes a light source, a light sensor, and necessary optical apparatus to deflect and focus a light beam on the storage medium. The write device includes a light source and necessary optical apparatus to deflect and focus a light beam on the storage medium. The read and write devices may share some common parts. The light source is preferably a laser. The wavelength of the light is chosen to be compatible with the storage medium. The storage medium is made of a substrate which is transparent to the light beam from the read device and the write device. Examples of substrate materials are plastics and glasses.A number of cells, or bubbles, with empty spaces of certain shape, are embedded in the substrate. The space inside the cell is filled with a gas or is in vacuum. A certain amount of ablative material is deposited on the wall of the cell. The ablative material is opaque to the light beam from the read device and the write device. Examples of the ablative materials are sodium, potassium, zinc, sulfur, phosphorus, iodine, and ammonium chloride. The ablative material can be vaporized by a high intensity light beam from the write device. The substrate may be made in the shape of a disk, a drum, a slide, or a tape.The disk is spun by a disk drive and the tape mounted on a tape drive. To read or write a particular cell, a light beam must be directed towards the cell. The selection of the cell is done by moving the storage medium to the proper position or by deflection or switching of the light beam to the desirable location. For example, the substrate may be a disk that spins r under a read or write head, or a tape that is pulled through a read or write head. Alternatively, the substrate may be a slide and a light beam is deflected and focused on a certain location of the slide. Each cell in the substrate is capable of storing one bit or more of digital information. It can also store analog information. The distribution of the ablative material on the cell wall determines the content of the information stored.During a read operation, a low intensity light beam is directed towards the cell to detect the pattern of distribution of the ablative material. During a write operation, a high intensity light beam is directed towards the cell to vaporize and redistribute the ablative material. Fig. I shows a first embodiment of the invention as a binary information storage device Fig. 2 shows an alternative embodiment having a storage capacity of more than one bit Fig. 3 shows an analog information storage device Figs. 4 7 show image type information storage devices. Many different embodiments of this form of invention are possible. Four preferred embodiments are described as follows In one embodiment of the invention, a cell is used to store one bit of information. The cell is made in an elongated shape with its middle slightly constricted. When a bit of information is stored, one end of the cell has the ablative material covering its wall and the other end is clear of the ablative material. A binary one or zero is stored depending on which end is covered or clear.To read the information, a low intensity light beam is directed towards one particular end of the cell.A light sensor downstream of the light beam is used to detect the content of the information. To change the content of the information previously stored, a high intensity light beam is directed towards the end covered with ablative material. The light beam is of sufficient intensity so that the ablative material is vaporized. The vaporized material diffuses to the other end and is then allowed to cool down and deposit on its wall. As a result, a binary zero is changed to a one or vice versa. Figure 1 illustrates such an embodiment. A substrate 1 is made as a slide. A cut on the slide exposes one half of a cell. The cell has two ends 3 and 4 joined by a narrower section. The two ends represent the numbers 0 and 1. If the end 3 is clear and the end 4 is covered, the number 0 is stored. If the end 4 is clear and the end 3 is covered, the number 1 is stored.A light beam 2 is shown directed towards the lower end of the cell. In a second embodiment of the invention, a cell may be used to store more than one bit of digital information. The cell will be in the shape of a long rod. The rod is divided into several portions. The rod is slightly constricted between two neighboring portions. When an information, or a number, is stored, every portion except one is covered with the ablative material. The portion that is clear of the ablative material represents the information stored. During a read operation, a light beam scans through the whole length of the cell and a light sensor downstream detects which portion is clear of the ablative material. Alternatively, several light beams can be directed towards different portions of the cell simultaneously and a corresponding number of light sensors is used to detect which portion is clear of the ablative material.During a write operation, a wide beam of light is directed towards the whole length of the cell. The light beam covers the entire cell and has enough intensity to vaporize all the ablative material in the cell. The light beam is then turned off to allow the vaporized material to cool down and deposit uniformly on the cell wall. Thus the old information is erased. New information can subsequently be written by passing a high intensity light beam on a particular portion of the cell. The light beam vaporizes the ablative material in that portion and forces the material to deposit in other parts of the cell. Figure 2 illustrates such an embodiment. A substrate 21 is made as a slide. A cut on the slide exposes one half of a cell. The cell is divided into three portions 23, 24, and 25. Each portion is used to represent one of three distinct numbers.For example, they can be used to represent the numbers 0, 1 and 2. A light beam 2 is shown directed towards the portion 24 of the cell. In a third embodiment of the invention, a cell is used to store analog information. The cell is made in the shape of a rod with a uniform width. The information is read and written in a similar fashion as in the second embodiment of this form of the invention. However, the cell is not divided into a discrete number of portions. When information is stored, the whole length of the cell is covered with the ablative material except a small spot. The location of the clear spot represents the information stored. During a read operation the location of the clear spot is sensed by a light beam scanning through the length of the cell. During a write operation, the old information is erased by simultaneously vaporizing all the ablative material in the cell and then allowing it to cool down and deposit uniformly on the wall. New information is subsequently written by directing an intense light beam towards a certain spot in the cell to remove the ablative material at that spot. Figure 3 illustrates such an embodiment. A substrate 31 is made as a slide. A cut on the slide exposes one half of a cell 33. A light beam 2 is shown directed towards a spot on the cell. The distance of a clear spot from the bottom of the cell represents the analog information stored. In a fourth embodiment of the invention, a cell similar to the one in the third embodiment is used. But the analog information is stored in a different way. A portion of the cell on one end is covered with the ablative material. The rest of the cell is clear of the ablative material. The boundary between the two portions is used to represent the information.To read this information, a wide beam of light is directed towards the entire cell. The amount of light that passes through is sensed. The amount is proportional to the length of the portion of the cell clear of the ablative material. To write the information, a wide beam of light is directed towards the cell to distribute the ablative material uniformly in the cell. Another beam is subsequently directed towards a portion of the cell on one end to clear that portion of the ablative material. The boundary between the two portions is used to represent the information written. The second form of the invention is disclosed as follows In this form of the invention, the storage medium is used to store a visual image which can be viewed by human eyes directly. The image may be in colors or in black and white. The image is broken up into very small dots of various colors and shades, in a manner similar to that of a printed halftone image or a color television picture. The substrate is made as a slide which is viewed from its front. It has arrays of cells of empty spaces and pigment plates arranged in a regular pattern. The cells and the pigment plates together represent dots on the image. Each cell has one or more pigment plates near it. The space inside the cell is in vacuum or is gas filled. A certain amount of ablative material is deposited on the cell wall. The color and shade of the ablative material are different from those of the pigment plate of the same cell. Each cell has a forward portion and a storage portion. The ablative material can be moved between the forward portion and the storage portion by a high intensity light beam.The wave length of the light used during a write operation is chosen so that the light is easily absorbed by the ablative material but not by the pigment plate. The forward portion is in front of a pigment plate so that the pigment plate is covered if the ablative material is deposited on its wall. The storage portion stores the ablative material and is arranged in a location and direction to give the stored ablative material minimal visibility. The shape of the cell and the arrangement of the pigment plate may be different from one embodiment to another. Furthermore, more than one cell can be arranged with their forward portions in front of a pigment plate in an overlapping way. Four preferred embodiments will be described as follows Figure 4 shows the first embodiment. Each cell in a substrate 41 has two portions, a forward portion 43, and a storage portion 44.The two portions are connected by a neck 45. The forward portion 43 is close to the front surface of the slide and the storage portion 44 is near the back side of the slide. Looking from one edge of the slide, the cell has aU shape cross section. Between the two portions of the cell, a pigment plate 46 is embedded in the substrate. Another plate 47 is embedded behind the neck 45 of the cell. The pigment plate is used for direct viewing when it is uncovered and also for stopping and reflecting the light beam during a write operation.A certain amount of ablative material is deposited on the cell wall. The ablative material may be moved from one portion of the cell to the other by a high intensity light beam. A high intensity light beam 2 coming from the front of the slide, and directed towards the forward portion 43 and the neck 45 of the cell will be stopped and reflected by pigment plates 46 and 47.The ablative materials in the forward portion 43 and the neck 45 are then vaporized and allowed to be deposited in the storage portion 44. If the light beam is directed towards only part of the forward portion 43, then the forward portion 43 remains partially covered with the ablative material. Similarly, directing a high intensity beam of light from the back of the slide and towards the storage portion 44 of the cell will move the ablative material to the forward portion and the neck. Thus the pigment plate of a particular cell may be covered or uncovered, in part or in whole, by the ablative material when it is viewed from the front of the slide. This arrangement of the cell and the pigment plates together represents a dot on the image. On the slide, pigment plates of different colors and shades and ablative material of different colors and shades cançbe arranged in a regular pattern. Lights of different wave lengths can be used by the write device to move the ablative materials in the cells. By choosing the colors and shades of the pigments and the ablative material properly, and by covering and uncovering the pigment plates of the cells in certain pattern, an image can be formed on the slide. This image can be viewed directly by human eyes. The image can also be read by a read device. The read device directs a light beam towards the forward portion of the cell. Part of the light beam is reflected by the ablative material in the cell and the pigment behind the forward portion.The intensity and color of the reflected light depends on the distribution of the ablative material in the forward portion. The reflected light is detected by a sensor in the read device. The sensed color and intensity can be used to duplicate the picture with a write device. Thus the image can be duplicated easily by a machine. In another embodiment of the invention, the storage medium is similar to the one shown in Figure 4. However, the shape of the cell is different. it has an H shape cross section, Figure 5 shows such an embodiment. A substrate 51 has a cell in it.The cell has a forward portion 53 and a storage portion 54. The two portions are connected by a neck 55. Two pigment plates 56 and 57 are located between the two portions 53 and 54. Another pigment plate 58 is located behind the neck 55. Light beam 2 is shown directed towards the forward portion 53 and the neck 55.This arrangement of the cell and the pigment plates together represents a dot on the image. The mode of operation of the storage medium and the read, write devices for it, is similar to that of Figure 4. Figure 6 shows still another embodiment of the invention. A substrate 61 has a cell in it. Each cell has two portions, a forward portion 63, and a storage portion 64. The forward portion 63 is close to the front surface of the slide and a pigment plate 65 is embedded behind it. The storage portion 64 is located beside the pigment plate and is connected to the forward portion 63. Looking from one edge of the slide, the cell has an L shape cross section. The pigment plate is used for direct viewing when it is uncovered and also for stopping and reflecting the light beam during a write operation. A certain amount of ablative material is deposited on the cell wall. The ablative material may be moved from one portion of the cell to the other by a high intensity beam.A light beam 2 coming from the front of the slide, and directed towards the forward portion of the cell will be stopped by the pigment plate 65. The ablative material in the forward portion 63 is then vaporized and allowed to be deposited in the storage portion 64.If the light beam is directed towards only part of the forward portion 63, the forward portion remains partially covered with the ablative material. Similarly, directing a high intensity beam of light from the front of the slide and towards the storage portion 64 of the cell will move the ablative material to the forward portion 63. Thus the pigment plate of a particular cell may be covered or uncovered, in part or in whole, by the ablative material when it is viewed from the front of the slide. This arrangement of the cell and the pigment plates together represents a dot on the image. Figure 7 shows a slide of substrate 71. The substrate 71 has two cells. The first cell has a front portion 73, a storage portion 74, and a neck 75. The second cell has a front portion 76, a storage portion 77, and a neck 78. A pigment plate 79 is behind the portions 73 and 76. Two more pigment plates 80 and 81 are behind the neck 75 and the neck 78 respectively. The two front portions 73 and 76 are overlapping in front of the pigment plate 79. A light beam 2 is shown directed towards portions 73, 76 and necks 75, 78. The three pigment plates are all of a same color which is chosen to be represented by the two cells. The ablative material in the first cell is white. The ablative material in the second cell is black. Both materials can be moved in the cells by high intensity light beams of suitable wave lengths. To move the material from the front portion and neck to the storage portion, the light beam is directed from the front of the slide. To move the material from the storage portion to the front portion and the neck, the light beam is directed from behind the slide. This arrangement of cells and pigment plates together represents a dot of a particular color on the image. The dot can display the color of the pigment plate, or black, or white. The provision of two cells permits greater contrast for the image.
