## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING 8 FLUOROERYTHRONOLIDEFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for preparing a 8 fluoroerythronolide derivative. More particularly, it relates to a process for preparing 8 fluoroerythronolide A and 8 fluoroerythromycin.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 8 FluoPoerythromycin A is chemically more stable than erythromycin A under an acidic condition and has as broad antibacterial spectrum as that of erythromycin A.Therefore, 8 fluoroerythromycin A is useful for oral administration cf. Journal of Antibiotics, 36, No. 11, 1585 1983 . 8 Fluoroerythromycin A has been prepared by reacting 8,9 anhydroerythronolide A 6,9 hemiketal with trifluoromethylhypofluorite to fluorinate the 8 position of the hemiketal and then microbiologically attaching desosamine and cladinose to the 8 fluorocompound cf. Tetrahedron, 40, 2177 1984 , or by reacting 8,9 anhydroerythromycin A6,9 hemiketal N oxide with trifluoromethylhypofluorite or perchlorylfluoride to fluorinate the 8 position of the hemiketal and reducing the 8 fluorocompound with hydrogen cf. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication unexamined No. 109496 1983 . In the above processes, trifluoromethylhypofluorite or perchlorylfluoride is used as a fluorination agent, but the reaction system for carrying out the fluorination with these compounds tends to explode. Therefore, the above conventional methods are not suitable for commercial production of 8 fluoroerythromycin A.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One object of the pre3ent invention is to provide a safe process for preparing 8 rluoroerythronolide derivatives. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing 8 fluoroerythronolide derivatives, particularly 8 fluoroerythronolide A and 8fluoroerythromycin A N oxide.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing g 8 fluoroerythronolide derivative comprising reacting an erythronolide derivative with acylhypofluorite of the formula RCOOF I wherein R is a C1 C5 aliphatic group.
