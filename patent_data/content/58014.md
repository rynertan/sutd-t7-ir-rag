# Selective hydrogenation of a hydrocarbon feed.

## Abstract
Palladium or platinum is deposited on a low acidity silica polymorph to yield a supported catalyst particularly useful in the hydrogenation of acetylenes and diolefins. The catalyst has a decreased tendency to promote polymerization which causes fouling than previously used alumina catalysts.
