# SUNROOF CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A controller 1 for vehicle sunroofs 2 having a retractable door or closure 5 . Two tracks 30, 31 are mounted in a main frame 3 of the sunroof, along opposite sides of the closure. Guides 7 project laterally outward from the sides of the closure, and are matingly received in the tracks to slidingly support the closure for fore to aft transla tion between open and closed positions. A seal 8 is located between the closure and the frame to form a weathertight seal therebetween. The guides include cams or eccentrics 9 that are positioned in the tracks, and are shaped so that rotation of the eccentrics raises and lowers the closure in the main frame. When the eccentrics are rotated to a locked position, the closure is raised into abutting, compressive contact with the seal to sealingly close the opening. When the eccentrics are rotated into an unlocked position, the closure is lowered out of abutting contact with the seal to permit the closure to be freely opened.
