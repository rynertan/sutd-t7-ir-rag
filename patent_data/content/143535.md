# Multiplex image reproducing method.

## Abstract
A method of reproducing multiplex images wherein an electrostatic image is formed on an image retainer 1 by using a common electrostatic image forming device, the electrostatic image formed on the image retainer 1 is developed, the steps of the above are repeated to superpose a plurality of toner images on the image retainer 1 , and the toner images is transferred on a recording paper by one step. The developings other than the first time developing are carried out in such a manner that the surface of a developer layer on a developer feeding carrier 31 does not contact with the surface of the toner image on the image retainer 1 .
