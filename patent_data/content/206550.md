# Static hydraulic pressure type continuously variable transmission.

## Abstract
A static hydraulic pressure type continuously variable trans mission T having a hydraulic closed circuit formed between a swashplate type hydraulic pump P and a swashplate type hydraulic motor M , in which a high pressure oil passage 40 is communicated through exhaust valves 42 with a number of cylinder bores 8 annularly disposed in a pump cylinder 7 of the hydraulic pump P , a low pressure oil passage 41 is communi cated through intake valves 43 with the cylinder bores 8 , and a number of distribution valves 44 capable of being reciprocated are radially disposed so as to provide an alternate communication between a number of cylinder bores 18 annularly disposed in a motor cylinder 17 of the hydraulic motor M and the high and low pressure oil passages. An eccentric ring 47 for imparting reciprocation to each distribution valve 44 is provided and a discharge side of a replenishing pump is communicated with an inner end surface of each distribution valve 44 to hydraulically urge the distribution valve in a direction of engagement with the eccentric ring 47 .
