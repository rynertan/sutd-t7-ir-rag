# CAST RECUPERATOR TUBE

## Abstract
The method of casting a plate type recuperative heat exchange envelope 8 that encloses a hollow space therein in a single casting operation. A sand core 18 with a heat sensitive binder therein defines the hollow space within the envelope. The sand core 18 is supported by end extensions 30 and lateral protuberances 26 which rest on the sides of a sand mold 10 to provide a space 25 therebetween that is subsequently filled with molten metal to comprise an envelope casting. Lateral openings 31 through the envelope casting produced by the lateral protuberances 26 and end openings 33 produced by the end extensions 30 provide passageways for venting gases produced within the sand core during the casting operation, and after completion of the casting operation the same openings 31 in the envelope assist in the removal of the sand core therefrom. The lateral openings 31 art subsequently plugged while the end openings 33 are maintained open to direct the flow of fluid therethrough.
