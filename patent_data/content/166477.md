# Method and system for producing a reactively sputtered conducting transparent metal oxide film onto a continuous web.

## Abstract
Method for producing a reactively sputtered conducting transparent metal oxide film onto a continuous web moving in a sputtering chamber at a distance past a metal target, which is in combination with a counterelectrode powered such that a sputter ing plasma discharge is generated inside the sputtering chamber transferring metal atoms from the target to the moving web, whereby oxygen is introduced into said chamber containing a low pressure atmosphere of an inert gas to produce a metal oxide coating. During the sputter process the surface resistance of the coating is continuously monitored at least at two areas across the width of the continuously moving web, whereby the sputtering conditions are controlled such that at least one area exhibits an optimum minimum resistance value.
