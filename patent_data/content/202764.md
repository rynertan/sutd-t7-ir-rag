# POTENTIOMETER

## Abstract
A potentiometer, particularly suitable for use in automo tive engine management systems, comprises a film resist ance track 1 on a substrate 2 and terminals 10, 11 for connection to a voltage source. A wiper 3,7 traverses the track 1 and a conductive collector 8 which is connected to a terminal 6 at which an output voltage is obtained. A film resistor network 9A, 9B is provided at one or both ends of the track 1 in series with the track 1 and the terminals 10, 11 , or in parallel with a portion 1A of the track 1 at one or both ends thereof. The networks 9A, 9B comprise intercon nected resistance elements formed by application of conduc tive film links 14A, 14B to a single film resistance element 12A, 12B , the links 14A, 14B being selectively severable to allow adjustment, to a predetermined value, of the resistance of the network s 9A, 9B in series with the track 1 or in parallel with the portion 1A of the track 1 . The networks 9A, 9B allow the output voltage characteristics of the potentiometer with respect to the wiper position, to be adjusted.
