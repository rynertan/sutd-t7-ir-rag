# Substrate voltage generator.

## Abstract
A precision regulation substrate voltage generator cir cuit contains a variable frequency oscillator 40 and employs frequency modulation to modify the oscillator frequency driving a substrate charge pump 44 , in order to more precisely control the resultant substrate voltage Vsx in an integrated circuit.
