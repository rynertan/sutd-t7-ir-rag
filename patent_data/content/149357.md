## Description
This invention relates to the preparation of liquid resins that are suitable for impregnating winding filaments in the wet winding of composite structures, and particularly to the preparation of such resins that contain high vinyl, functionally terminated polybutadienes and yield low density crosslinked products when cured. The use of functionally terminated polybutadienes to make crosslinkable resins is well known. See, for example, U.S.Patents 4,269,759 4,016,022 3,989,769 3,931,354 3,925,275 3,922,426 3,860,672 3,853,815 3,751,522 3,635,891 3,616,193 3,528,878 3,431,235 and 3,135,716. In these patents, the resins typically are formulated with both a chain extender , which reacts with the terminal groups of the polybutadiene, and with free radical initiators for crosslinking of polybutadiene. However, these patents are not primarily concerned with the preparation of resins that are suitable for filamentwinding. U.S. Patent 3,616,193 discloses the advantages of functionally terminated polybutadienes in filament winding resins and their potential for providing crosslinked products that have relatively low density. U.S. Patent 4,421,806 discloses a wide variety of processes for preparing polybutadiene resins, including some carboxy terminated ones, that are said to be specifically suitable for filament winding. However, the latter patent fails to show how to adjust selectively the many disclosed formulation parameters to produce resins having superior characteristics, in particular, low shrinkage characteristics, for filament winding or the preparation of prepregs . In particular, such resins not only should have a cured density that is as low as possible, but also must have other properties that are more important, depending on the intended application, and call for formulation parameters that may conflict with those that decrease density. Thus for all applications, the linear shrinkage is critical and should be less than 3 . Overall, it is essential that the various trade offs should be known and controllable to provide the desired balance of properties. According to the invention, a process for preparing liquid resins that are suitable for filament winding of composite structures, in which a polymer component containing a high vinyl, functionally terminated poly 112 butadiene , the functional groups being reactive with epoxy groups, is intimately mixed with an epoxy component, an ethylenically unsaturated component, a peroxide free radical initiator component, and a catalyst that catalyzes the reaction between the functional groups and epoxy groups, is characterized in that i the polymer component consists essentially of a between about 60 and 100 parts by weight of high vinyl, functionally terminated polybutadiene that has a molecular weight between about 1,000 and 3,000, and b between about 0 and 40 parts by weight of a low vinyl functionally terminated polybutadiene having a molecular weight between about 1,000 and 3,000, or a hydrogenated and functionally terminated polybutadiene or a mixture of the two, each of a and b having about 2 functional groups per polymer molecule that are reactive with epoxy ii the epoxy component consists essentially of one or more diepoxy compounds each having two cycloaliphatic groups in each of which adjacent carbon atoms are connected by an oxygen atom to provide between about 0.5 and 1.05 epoxy groups for each of the said epoxy reactive functional groups iii up to about 80 parts by weight of an ethylenically unsaturated component that includes a methacrylate compound, per 100 parts by weight of the polymer component, is included in the mixture to lower the viscosity of the liquid resin and iv the peroxide free radical initiator component has a 10 hour half life temperature between about 900C and 1050C. The term high vinyl, functionally terminated polybutadiene refers to polybutadienes having at least about 80 of their unsaturation in the form of the 1, 2 vinyl group EMI3.1 tb R SEP SEP CH2 CH SEP R1 tb SEP CH SEP vinyl SEP I tb SEP II tb SEP CH2 tb wherein R and R1 constitute the remainder of the polybutadiene molecule and contain, on the average, between about 14 and 49 other 1, 2 vinyl groups. The term low vinyl functionally terminated polybutadiene refers to polybutadienes that contain a relatively large number of 1, 4 cis and trans groups EMI3.2 tb SEP R3 tb c c SEP cis SEP II tb H SEP H tb Rq SEP C SEP SEP C SEP H SEP trans SEP III tb H tb SEP R5 tb wherein the R2, R3 and R4, R5 are respectively the remainders of the polybutadiene molecule and less than 80 of the unsaturation in the remainders is composed of 1, 2 vinyl groups. The preferred functionally terminated polybutadienes are carboxy terminated polybutadienes. Also according to the invention, liquid filament winding resins are characterized in that they are made by the process according to the invention, they have a pot life, sufficient for filament winding, of about 10 or more hours, and they cure to thermally stable, solid, crosslinked resins having a linear shrinkage value less than 38. In using the liquid filament winding resins according t.c the invention, the crosslinking of the polymer component, which is initiated by the peroxide free radical initiator component is preferably made to occur through application of heat to the resin. The reaction between the epoxy component and the olymercomponent can be initiated during the filament winding operation. Thus, the ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents are included in the resin formulations to maintain an appropriate viscosity level in the resin during filamentwinding, when condensation of the functionally terminated polybutadiene is being catalytically initiated. Normally, only after the winding is complete, the ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluent enters into the peroxy crosslinked network of the functionally terminated polybutadiene during cure of the filament wound body. The liquid filament winding resins are not only adapted for use as a crosslinkable resin matrix for winding filaments about a mandrel they may also be used in coating fibrous tapes and wafers to make prepregs . The prepregs can then be used as added, cure compatible, reinforcement to filament wound bodies made using the liquid filamentwinding resin. The low vinyl or hydrogenated functionally terminated polybutadiene, if included in the resins, serves to lower the modulus and increase the flexability of the cured resins.Hydrogenated and functionally terminated polybutadiene, i.e.greater than 90 of the polybutadiene is saturated, can be used in place of the low vinyl functionally terminated polybutadiene, in whole or in part. The manufacture of functionally terminated polybutadiene is well known. For example, carboxy terminated polybutadienes can be prepared by anionic polymerization of l,3 butadiene, I In a typical reaction system, an alkali metal, e.g., lithium or sodium, is dispersed with the butadiene in a polar solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The butadiene undergoes a 1,2 polymerization to produce a polyaliphatic hydrocarbon terminated by the alkali metals. The resulting polymer is characterized mainly by an elongated carbon chain having pendant vinyl groups on alternate carbon atoms of the chain. The polymer is then reacted with carbon dioxide and subsequently acidified to provide the desired high vinyl, carboxyterminated polybutadiene. U.S. Patent 3,135,716 discloses preparation of functionally terminated polybutadienes. Functionally terminated polybutadienes preferred for use in this invention are commercially available. It is important that the epoxy component should consist essentially of one or more diepoxy compounds each having a pair of cycloaliphatic groups in each of which adjacent carbon atoms are connected by an oxygen atom to provide the epoxy functionality of the diepoxy compound. Epoxy compounds suitable for use in this invention include those having the general formula ABAÚ IV where each of A and A1 is a cycloaliphatic group bearing an oxygen atom bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of its ring structure and B is a divalent, aliphatic, linking group. The epoxy component is selected to be sufficiently reactive to react in the presence of catalyst with the functional groups of the functional terminated polybutadiene at temperatures below about 80 C. The molecular weight number average of the diepoxy compounds ranges between about 230 and 360. Preferred epoxy components additionally have viscosities low enough to reduce initially the viscosity of the liquid filament winding resin into which they are added. Examples of di epoxy compounds are 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl methyl 3,4 epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexylmethyl 3,4 epoxy 6 methylcyclohexane carboxylate bis 2,3epoxycyclopentyl ether 2 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl 5,5 spiro 3, 4 epoxy cyclohexane meta dioxane and bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexyS ad ipate. The 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl methyl 3,4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate is preferred. The amount of the epoxy component used is such that there are between about 0.5 and 1.05 epoxy groups for each functional group of the functionally terminated polybutadiene. A more preferred range for the liquid filament winding resins is between about 0.9 and 1.0 epoxy groups for each terminal functional group i.e. carboxy of the polymer component. The ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents may contain such groups as allyl, vinyl, isopropenyl, or acrylarve and acording to the invention, they must contain methacrylate groups in order to provide superior characteristics. Examples of suitable ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents include the following Laurylmethacrylate isodecylmethacrylate cyclohexyl methacrylate tetrahydro furfurylmethacrylate isobornylmethacrylate dicyclopentenyl oxyethylmethacrylate, tetraethyleneglycoldimethacrylate 1,6 hexanedioldimethacrylate 1,3 butyleneglycoldimethacrylate and trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate. These or other methacrylate compounds may be used in combination with other unsaturated reactive diluents, such as a methylstyrene vinyltoluene divinylbenzene t butylstyrene m diisopropenylbenzene diallylphthalate diallylmaleate and triallylcyanurate. Selection and blending of ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents containing methacrylate compounds contributes significantly to the liquid filament winding resin volatility, shrinkage, density and other physical properties. Methacrylate reactive diluents cannot be replaced by acrylates, which are denser, more viscous, more reactive, more toxic and more volatile than the methacrylates. In addition, the lower molecular weight hydrocarbon ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents such as styrene, alpha methyl styrene, vinyl toluene and divinyl benzene are too volatile to be used alone, although such use is suggested in the aforesaid U.S. Patent 4,421,806.Higher molecular weight hydrocarbons such as m diisopropenylbenzene and p diisopropenylbenzene also have not been able to replace the methacrylates. The peroxide free radical initiators suitable for use in the liquid filament winding resins include those selected from peroxyketals, peroxyesters and dialkyl peroxides, that have a 10 hour half life temperature between about 900C and 105 cm. Preferably, undiluted peroxides that are completely soluble in the resin formulations are used. Examples of organic peroxide compounds that may be used in the invention are l,l di t butylperoxy 3,3, 5 trimethylcyclohexane t butylperoxy 2 ethylhexaneoate t butylperoxybenzoate and 2,5dimethyl 2,5 di benzoylperoxy hexane. Combinations of such peroxide free radical initiators may be used. The amount of the peroxide free radical initiator used in liquid filament winding resins is such that there is initially between about 0.004 and 0.040 peroxy groups in the peroxide free radical initiator component for each double bond in the polymer component of the liquid filament winding resins. A more preferred range is between about 0.018 and 0.028 peroxy groups for each such double bond. Any catalyst that catalyzes the reaction between epoxy compound and the terminal functionality of the functionallyterminated polybutadiene at a temperature below about BOO C. may be used. Exemplary catalysts for catalyzing reaction between epoxy and carboxy groups are chromium carboxylates such as the chromium salt of 3,5 diisopropylsalicylate and chromium octoate. Table A lists preferred and more preferred ranges, in parts by weight, of the ingredients used in the liquid filamentwinding resins of this invention TABLE A More Preferred Preferred Functionally terminated poly 100 100 butadiene Cycloaliphatic epoxy resin 8 22 10 22 Ethylenically unsaturated reactive 24 80 30 76 diluent Peroxide free radical initiators 3.5 14 3.5 8.5 Catalyst 0.3 3.0 1.0 2.0In preparing the liquid filament winding resins of this invention, the ingredients are weighed into an appropriate mixing container, the preferred order of addition being polymer component, epoxy component, ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluent, peroxide and finally catalyst.The container is heated externally and mechanically stirred the resin temperature is preferably not allowed to exceed about 40 C. A uniform, well mixed resin formulation results usually within 10 to 30 minutes. The mixtures are then cooled to ambient temperature e.g. 25 C. to have viscosities preferably between about 1.5 to 3.5 Kcps at 25 C. Pot lives range between about 10 to 100 hours at these viscosities. Catalyst containing complete resin formulations can be stored for several months at 180C. without significant viscosity change or loss of properties. Resin formulations, complete except for catalyst or epoxide, can be stored for at least seven months at 180C, without detectable viscosity change or loss of properties. The principle use for the resins of this invention is in filament winding. Dry fiber tows, such as Kevlar, graphite, glass, ceramic or others with or without sizings, are impregnated with the liquid filament winding resin and wound upon a rotating mandrel. The resin content of the fiber varies from about 25 to 40 weight percent the fiber volumes vary from about 55 to 65 with 58 to 61 being preferred. The liquid filament winding resins cure at temperatures in a range between about 200C. and 177 C. The optimum cure cycle will vary with the particular resin formulation and application. An exemplary cure cycle is heating to a temperature between about 700 C. and 800 C. for 3 hours, followed by heating to a temperature between about 900C. and 1100 C. for 2 hours followed by heating to a temperature between about 1100C. and 1300C. for 1 hour, followed by heating to a temperature between about 1300C. and l770C. for four hours. Somewhat lower cure temperatures may be used if aluminum fittings are incorporated into the filament wound structure undergoing cure.The initial step or steps of the cure cycle are designed to encourage the epoxy carboxy chain extension reaction to occur while excluding the vinyl polymerizatpn initiated by the peroxide free radical ti., initiator however, in some cases the desired properties are achieved by permitting the bulk of both reactions to occur almost simultaneously. Certain ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents like isobornylmethacrylate IBOMA , alone and in combination with hexanedioldimethacrylate HDDMA , which constitute preferred diluents, can cause earlier decomposition of the peroxide free radical initiator. The resulting early exotherm produced by IBOMA is not necessarily undesirable, but can be mitigated if desired by replacing at least 108 by weight of the IBOMA, or combination with HDDMA, with other suitable diluents such as lauryl methacrylate. Early peroxide exotherms can also occur if the epoxy carboxy reaction of the functionally terminated polybutadiene and epoxy compound is particularly vigorous during the initial cure cycle step at 800C. Such early cure cycle exotherms can also be mitigated by replacing at least about 10t by weight of the higher 1,2 vinyl polybutadiene such as C 1000 Nippon Soda with lower 1,2 vinyl polybutadienes. Also, if the initial cure cycle step temperature is lowered to 700C. from 800C., the early exotherm caused by peroxide reaction can be mitigated. Another use for the resins of this invention is the fabrication of prepregs containing continuous fibers such as in tapes or wafers. The prepreg cure chemistry is identical to that of the liquid filament winding resins of this invention. Prepreg tapes and wafers are used in filament wound constructions to both reinforce and to rapidly change contours or increase wall thicknesses in specific areas for structural reasons. The winding resins of this invention can be used directly to make prepreg tapes and wafers. Dry sized graphite or Kevlar fiber in the form of either compact multiple tows or flat, spreadout, linear fibers formed from multiple tows, or woven tape, is impregnated with a liquid filament winding resin according to the invention having moderate viscosity, e.g., 3600 cps. The impregnated multiple tows are wound on a mandrel at about 27 C. between close fitting, release film covered metal plates to form wafers. Completed wafers are sealed in nonadhering polyethylene bags. The impregnated, spread out, linearly oriented fibers or woven tape are sandwiched between release paper and wound into rolls. In both cases, the impregnated fiber is then B staged partially cured under conditions which exclude decomposition of the dissolved peroxide. Temperatures forB staging range between about 270C and 82 C, but temperatures between about 60 C and 770C are preferred. Proper B staging increases the resin viscosity to between about 70,000 and 125,000 cps at 50 C. Prepreg materials made in this manner are stored at 0 C. The following examples are intended to illustrate this invention by way of specific embodiments thereof. The properties of the resins identified in Tables I VII were obtained according to the following procedures. In making these resins, the ingredients were mixed as previously described until a clear solution resulted. The clear solutions were degassed at about 250C. and then cured neat. All resins were cured in a forced air oven using the following cure cycle 4 hrs. 800C., 2 hrs. 104to., 1 hr. 1210C., and 3 hrs. l4l0C. Heat distortion temperatures at 264 psi were measured on standard, cast 5 inch long by half inch square bars using a 20C. min. temperature increase. Densities were measured on 1 4X 1 2 X 1 2 inch samples using the weight in air weight in water technique ASTM D71 78. The samples were sawed from the bottoms of the HDT bars, and sanded smooth on all sides. Linear shrinkage was measured with the 65 cm3 mold described in ASTMProcedure D2566 79. A silicone release agent DC 20 was applied from solvent and prebaked on the molds for 2 hours at 141 C. All steel or glass molds for all cast specimens were treated with release agent in the same way. Thermocouples were not used in the shrinkage samples. Measurements were made only on samples which released fully and were free sliding after cure.Measurements were made with a 12 inch micrometer after conditioning the samples three days at 50 RHM 750F. Volatility was determined from the weight loss of approximately 5 gram, 1 16 inch thick neat resin samples cured in shallow, disposable aluminum weighing cups in the same forced air oven with all the other samples. Initial viscosities and pot lives were measured at 25.0µC. with a Haake viscometer using a PKI cone with a short pressure spring, 500 torque and speed of 9. Tensile properties were measured at 0.2 1POM, 45 RH and ambient pressure according to ASTM D638 79.

The bottles were wound with HerculesW IM7X 12K graphite fiber impregnated with about 27 weight of the resins, at either ambient 21 24 C for resins H, AA andsBB, or at 60 C for resin CC, and wound on rotating metal mandrels. The mandrels had been prepared with inflatable elastic bladder coverings. The fiber content by volume was about 60 percent. The fiber winding patterns, band widths and numbers of layers were carefully controlled to exactly duplicate each other. The bottles were cured with rotation in a forced air oven using a ten hour cure cycle which ranged from 80 to 141 cm. The finished bottles had an excellent appearance and all resins were well cured.Average bottle burst pressures netting hoop fiber stresses, and bottle performance factors performance factor equals PV W where P is burst pressure, V is volume of the bottle and W is weight of the bottle are compared in Table II. These data show that the formulation H resin delivered higher netting hoop fiber stresses and higher PV W performance factors than the higher density epoxy resins.

The neat resin properties show that low density resin,Formulation H has very good high temperature properties, lower density, and longer ambient pot life than the epoxy Resins. Example 3 A series of liquid filament winding resins were prepared in accordance with this invention to determine properties attributable to various ethylenically unsaturated reactive diluents. Table IV shows the results when these diluents were formulated into resins having the ingredients of composition A of Example 1 except for the diluent. A brief study of Table IV reveals that isobornyl methacrylate IBOMA is the best diluent for low linear shrinkage, and it also gives high HDT and moderately low density, but its volatility is very high. Hexanedioldimethacrylate HDDMA gives very high HDT s, too high to measure, moderate linear shrinkage1 low volatility, but high density. Lauryl methacrylate LMA gives low density density, low volatility and moderate HDT, but shrinkage is very high. Table V illustrates resin physical properties as a function of ethylenically unsaturated diluent type, blend and concentration. As can be seen from Table V, altering E C ratios from 0.95 to 1.05 and adding 10 hydrogenated carboxy terminated polybutadiene does not significantly alter volatility or shrinkage. As is also seen, as volatility decreases, density increases. The reactive diluent t butyl styrene TBS gives the lowest density but also highest shrinkage and volatility. Addition of some isobornyl methacrylate IBOMA in I significantly reduces shrinkage, but not HDT or volatility, and increases density. IBOMA alone in J offers the lowest linear shrinkage and good HDT, but volatility is high. Reducing theIBOMA concentration in K reduces volatility and increases shrinkage. Addition of hexanediol dimethacrylate HDDMA in L and M reduces volatility and increases HDT without seriously increasing shrinkage or density. Addition of both lauryl methacrylate LMA and HDDMA significantly lowers volatility in N and 0 while maintaining good HDT and density, but linear shrinkage increases about 50 . Very low volatilities of 3 to 4 are possible with good HDT and moderate shrinkage by blending HDDMA and QM657 in P and Q , but density increases significantly to 1.05 to 1.06 g cc.Volatility was also reduced by reducing the initial diluent level, and thus increasing viscosity. The higher viscosity mixes M and Q were less volatile. IBoMA HDDMA and LMA IBOMA HDDMA systems were selected for further study based on the results shown in Table V. Both epoxy to carboxy E C and peroxide to double bond P DB ratios were varied using these diluent systems and the results shown inTable VI. A comparison of neat resin physical and ambient mechanical properties in Table VI shows that the variations in E C and P DB generally produced only small changes.In general, the IBOMA HDDMA formulations have significantly lower shrinkage and higher HDT, but also higher volatility and slightly higher densities than the LMA IBOMA HDDMA formulations.

As can be seen, the cured resin of this invention has greater thermal stability. Resin hardness of the cured resin of this invention determined using a Barber ColmanImpressor GYZJ 934 1 increased only slightly after five days i.e., 33.0 to 36.1 . In another test, it was shown that the antioxidants, Agerite Geltrol, Polyguard and combinations thereof did not affect significantly the changes in mechanical properties.
