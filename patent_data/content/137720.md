# TECHNIQUE FOR REPAIRING AND JOINING SMALL DIAMETER OPTICAL FIBER CABLES

## Abstract
A technique for repairing or joining lengths of ultra fine, small diameter optical fiber cables is described. The techni que comprises positioning a hollow cylindrical ferrule 28 over one of two cable portions 10, 12 forming a splice joint between the optical fibers 14 to be joined together forming a protective buffer layer 50 about the splice joint sliding the ferrule over the protective buffer layer and into overlap ping relationship with each cable portion and bonding the ferrule to each cable portion. An apparatus for performing the repair or joining technique is also described.
