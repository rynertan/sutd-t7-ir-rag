# Drive device of variable transmission ratio, particularly for operating an internal combustion engine supercharger.

## Abstract
The drive device 1 consists of a rotating casing 2 containing a fluid and carrying internally in an idle manner a sun gear 8 and a pair of respective planet gears 12 which mesh with the sun gear 8 and define a gear pump therewith the fluid is contained in an inner reservoir 7 of the casing, and this latter is provided, in correspondence with the meshing zones between the planet gears and sun gear, with respective intake chambers 16 connected to the reservoir 7 , and with delivery chambers 18 closed by automatic valves 20 which are kept closed by the preload ing of a spring 43 against a ball 42 and arranged to open at a predetermined pressure in order to connect the delivery chambers 18 to the reservoir 7 . A pneumatic device 60 also controls a respective shut off valve 62 in order to connect the delivery chambers 18 to the reservoir 7 independently of the opening of the automatic valves 20 .
