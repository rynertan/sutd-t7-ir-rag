# Process for production of gum composition with plural time releasing flavours.

## Abstract
A gum composition and a process for producing the same are disclosed. The composition contains a sequentially releasable plurality of flavouring components of different flavours. One or more of the flavours is encapsulated within a water insoluble coating. A separate liquid flavour component is introduced individually at a later stage and is available for immediate release.
