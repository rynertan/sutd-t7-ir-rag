## Description
Allenic AminesDescriptionTechnical FieldThis invention relates to novel allenic amines and to methods for their preparation as well as to pharmaceutical compositions containing the allenic amines and to the use of the allenic amines for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions.Background ArtDepressive disorders have with more or less success been treated with various compounds. Many types of chemical substances have been used, among these amphetamine with the structure EMI2.1 However, the euphoretic effect and the risk for dependence have to a great extent restricted the use of amphetamine in the therapy.The medical use of amphetamine is nowadays mainly restricted to the treatment of narcolepsy and asthenic states in aged people.A further type of chemical substances that have been suggested for use as an antidepressive agent in cludes monoamine oxidase enzyme inhibiting chemical compounds, for example compounds of the formulaEMI2.2 wherein X is hydrogen or chloro. These compounds are disclosed in Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 57, No. 3, March 1968, p 430 433, and in United States Patent No. 3,397,236.Disclosure of inventionWe have found that novel allenic amines of the formula EMI3.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, exhibit a higher monoamine oxidase enzyme lMAO inhibiting activity than the above mentioned known allenic amines. The pharmacological profile of the compounds of the invention suggests a potential value of the compounds as antidepressants, and in the treatment of Parkinson s disease.The compounds of this invention may be administered in the form of free bases or their salts with non toxic acids. Some typical examplcs of these salts are the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, phosphate, sulphate, citrate, and tartrate.Pharmaceutical preparationsIn clinical practice the compounds of the present invention will normally be administered orally, rectally or by injection, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations comprising the active ingredient either as a free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic, acid addition salt, e.g. the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, lactate, acetate, sulphate, sulphamate and the like in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Accordingly, terms relating to the novel compounds of this invention whether generically or specifically are intended to inlcude both the free amine base and the acid addition salts of the free base, unless the context in which such terms are used, e.g. in the specific examples would be inconsistent with the broad concept. The carrier may be a solid, semisolid or liquid diluent or capsule. These pharmaceutical preparations constitute a further aspect of this invention. Usually the active substance will constitute between 0.1 and 99 by weight of the preparation, more specifically between 0.5 and 20 by weight for preparation intended for injection and between 2 and 50 by weight for preparations suitable for oral administration. To produce pharmaceutical preparations containing a compound of the invention in the form of dosage units for oral application, the selected compound may be mixed with a solid pulverulent carrier, e.g. lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches such as potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin, cellulose derivatives, or gelatine, and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, polyethylene glycol waxes, and the like, and then compressed to form tablets. If coated tablets are required, the cores, prepared as described above, may be coated with a concentrated sugar solution which may contain, e.g. gum arabic, gelatine, talcum, titanium dioxide, and the like. Alternatively, the tablet can be coated with a lacquer dissolved in a readily volatile organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents.Dyestuffs may be added to these coatings in order to readily distinguish between tablets containing different active substances of different amounts of the active compound.For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules pearl shaped closed capsules consisting of gelatine and for example, glycerol or similar closed capsules, the active substance may be admixed with a vegetable oil. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granulates of the active substance in combination with solid, pulverulent carriers such as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches e.g. potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin , cellulose derivatives or gelatine.Dosage units for rectal application can be prepared in the form of suppositories comprising the active substance in admixture with a neutral fatty base, or gelatine rectal capsules comprising the active substance in admixture with vegetable oil or paraffin oil.Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of syrups or suspensions for example, solutions containing from about 0.2 to about 20 by weight of the active substance herein described, the balance being sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol, and propyleneglycol. Optionally such liquid preparations may contain colouring agents, flavouring agents, saccharine and carboxymethylcellulose as a thickening agent.Solutions for parenteral applications by injection can be prepared in an aqueous solution of a water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active substance preferably in a concentration of from about 0.5 to about 10 by weight.These solutions may also contain stabilizing agents and or buffering agents and may conveniently be provided in various dosage unit ampoules.Suitable peroral doses of the compounds of the invention are 2 20 mg, preferably 5 15 mg given 1 to 3 times a day, preferably 2 times a day. Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention The preferred compound of the invention is the compound of the formulaEMI5.1 in the form of its acid addition salt with hydrochloric acid.Methods of preparationReacting an acetylenic aminoether of the formula R O CH2 CiC CH2 NH2 wherein R is lower alkyl preferably methyl or l alkoxyalkyl, with a Grignard, or lithium reagent, of the formulaEMI6.1 in the presence of a Cu I salt as a catalyst.The reaction s conducted in a suitable solvent e.g. ethyl ether. Further information about this type of reaction can be found in Tetrahedron Letters No. 15, pp 1319 1322, 1978, and in the following working examples. IntermediatesFor the preparation of the compounds according to the invention it has been found that the compound of the formula R O CH2 C C CH2 NH2 wherein R is a lower alkyl group, preferably methyl, is a valuable starting material.The preparation of intermediates of this type is illustrated in Example 1 hereinbelow.

In order to evaluate a possible antidepressive effect of new substances biochemical ph rm cological test methods must be resorted to. One such method, which seems to give good indication of the potential antidepreEsixe effects of the test substances, is a test for monoamine ox4ase enzyme inhibiting activity. The deamination of 3H pheneteylemine, 3H tyramine, and t Cl 5 hydroxytryptamine by brain slices was determined according to the following method.Slices 100 mg of the central part of the mouse brain including hypothalamus, thalamus, and midbrain were incubated for 5 min with 1 x 10 7 M of the labeled substrate in 2.0 ml of Krebs Henseleit s buffer, pH 7.4, containing 11.2 mol of glucose,The slices were then homogenized in an all glass homogenizer with 1.0 ml of 1 N HCl containing carrier amounts 1 pg ml of the nonlabeled amine and its deaminated acid product. An aliquot of 1.1 ml of a brain homogenate in 10 vol of 1 N Hb1 containing the substrate and product carriers was added to 0.5 ml of the incubation medium.The brain homogenate was added In order to facilitate the extraction of tyramine and 5 HT. The acid and neutral products were extracted into 6.0 ml of ethyl acetate by vigorous shaking for 10 s. After centrifugation, 4.0 ml of the organic phase was taken for determination of radicactivity, The remaining ethyl acetate was removed the water phase was made alkaline with solid sodium carbonete and 1.0 ml of 0.5 M borate buffer, pH 10. The amine was then extracted into 6.0 ml of ethyl acetate and 4.0 ml of the organic phase was taken for 14 the assay. The deamination of 3Hltyramine and 14C1 5 HT was determined simultaneously by utilizing the double labeling technique. S.B. Ross, A.L.Renyi, and S. 0. ogre, Eur. J. Phaimacol., 17, 107 1972 .Inhibition of the MAO activity in the brain slices was determined 1 h after the intraperitoneal injection of the test compound.The inhibition was expressed in percent and calculated on the total formation of acid and neutral products formed in the brain slices of animals treated with the test compounds or with saline.The results are depicted in the following tables. The first series of tables relate to tests with the compound AuS 104, i.e. the compound 2 benzyl 2,3 butadienamine hydrochloride according to the invention. Deamination of phenethylamineDose inhib.
