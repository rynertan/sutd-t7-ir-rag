# A liquid coating composition, a method of coating a metal substrate and the metal substrate thus obtained.

## Abstract
The invention provides a coating composition for metal surfaces containing a binder, a high amount of an electrically conductive pigment such as zinc, and 0,05 5 per cent by weight, calculated on the coating composition, of at least 2 solid, powdered lubricants, at least one of them being inorganic. The invention also relates to a process for coating a metal surface using said coating composition, and the properly machinable and weldable coated substrate thus obtained.
