## Description
MACHINE FOR FILLING PASTRY PRODUCTS IN GENERAL, SUCH ASCROISSANTS, BEFORE BAKINGThis invention relates to a high productivity machine for filling pastry products such as oroissants, brioches, horns etc. with for example jam, cream, etc., before baking.Such pastry products are currently filled before being baked, by inserting a hollow needle transversely into them and injecting a small quantity of the stated cream, Jam etc. into their centre.In the said known filling system, the filling material is introduced only into the central part of the pastry product, said central part being wider than the others and thus most suitable for filling.In this respect, it should be noted that the pastry product would be more tasty and enJoyable if the same quantity of cream or Jam were homogeneously distributed along the longitudinal zone of said pastry product, but this is not possible by the known method.The main obJect of the present invention is to provide and protect a machine which is able to fill said pastry products before baking, which is of high productivity, and which is able to deposit the filling along a consistent longitudinal portion of said pastry products, within the framework of a simple and rational construction. This object is attained according to the invention by providing a horizontal conveyor comprising equidistant pairs of transverse elements which are fitted with two facing series of equidistant half shells arranged to form a corresponding number of open based cups for temporarily receiving said pastry products in an upright position. Nsre particularly, each cup formed from two half shells comprises a cavity able to receive one end of the horn, the central wider part of which rests on the mouth of said cup so as to keep the horn vertical. Xoreover, according to the invention the conveyor is driven withstepwise motion so that consecutive portions thereof are sequentially brought under an injection station comprising a plurality of vertical needles, these latter being distributed in the same manner as the cups, and being arranged to descend, with the conveyor stationary, to penetrate longitudinally into the horns and then withdraw from with them with simultaneous delivery of the filling material.Said filling operation terminates before the needles are completely withdrawn from the horns, and feeler switch means are provided at the entry to the inJection station to halt the conveyor should even one horn be transversely inclined.In addition, blowing means are provided downstream of the conveyor to facilitate discharge of the filled pastry products, said means being disposed along a curved portion of the conveyor so as to act on the rear of the filled products when the halfshells of the cups are in a diverged state, a removal conveyor then receiving the thus discharged filled products.The characteristics and constructional merits of the invention will be more apparent from the detailed description of one preferred embodiment thereof, given hereinafter by way of example Figure 1 is an overall side view of the inventionFigure 2 is a side view, to an enlarged scale, of that portion of the conveyor lying above the inJection station.Figure 3 is a section on the line III III of Figure 2.Said figures show a horizontally extending base frame 1, on which there is disposed a slat conveyor passing endlessly about two opposing pairs of sprocket wheels 2 of horizontal axis.As can be better seen from Figure 2, said horizontal conveyor comprises two chains 3, the links of which are connected together by equidistant pairs of adJacent transverse bars 4.In Figure 2 it can be seen that one pair of bars 4 is provided for every three chain links 3, but this must in no way be considered limitative.In addition, centrally provided on each pair of bars 4 there is a series of equidistant cups 5, which are divided into two halves associated with the respective bars 4, and extend below these latter where they remain open ended.The cups 5 are shaped in such a manner as to be able to retain in an erect position the unbaked pastry products to be filled, these latter being shown as horns 6.For this purpose, the cups 5 comprise a cavity which is flared towards its mouth so as to be able to receive the tapered end part of the horn 6, said mouth acting as a support for the central wider part of said horn 6 Figures 2 and 39. As clearly shown in Figure 3, the upper straight portion of the conveyor 3, 4 is supported by suitable lateral guides, and its upstream end Figure 1 const.ifutes the zone j,zl,wbish discharge takes place, this being effected manually. Said conveyor 3, 4 is driven with stepwise motion by way of a chain transmission 7 driven by a geared motor unit 8 see Figure 1 .Above the downstream end part of the upper straight portion of the conveyor 3, 4, there is a framework 9 provided lowerly with a horizontal fixed plate 10 on which a series of vertical guide bars 11 is slidably mounted, these being fixed to an overlying container 12 Respective springs 13 are moounted about the vertical bars 11 to raise the container 12, the downward movement of which is controlled by a cam device 14 Figure 1 . The container 12 also comprises an upper mouth 15 for loading the filling material, for example cream, Jam etc., and the said container 12 is connected in known manner to a convenient source of compressed air not shown .In addition, four transverse series of vertical hollow needles 16 branch from the base of the container 12 and are guided in respective bores in the horizontal plate 10, these being distributed in the same manner as the cups 5.In the illustrated embodiment, twelve cups 5 are provided for each pair of bars 4, so that fortyeight horns 6 are filled during each injection stage.It should be noted that the aforesaid in no way limits the scope of the invention.When the conveyor 3, 4 has undergone a forward movement corres pnding to a length comprising four pairs of bars 4, it stops, and the cam 14 receives the enabling command for lowering the container 12, so that the needles 16 also descend to penetrate longitudinally into the horns 6 until they reach the lower ends thereof as shown in Figure 2 by dashed and dotted lines. Ten the needles 16 begin to rise, the container 12 is t under pressure, and the filling material is injected into the pastry products 6.The delivery ceases before the needles 16 withdraw from the horns, the cam 14 stopping when it has undergone one complete revalution, after which the conveyor undergoes a further forward movement step.To prevent the horns 6 being filled in an irregular manner, a transverse comb of thin vertical strips 17 is hinged to the entry edge of the plate 10, this comb comprising, for each longitudinal line of cups 5, two strips symmetrically disposed about this latter in the immediate vicinity of the mouths of the cups 5 seeFigure 3 .Even if only one horn 6 of a transverse row is excessively inclined to the vertical axis of its cup 5, it strikes the comb 17 which, swinging rearwards, contacts a feeler switch 18 Figure 2 which halts the geared motor unit 8. The operation of the machine is restored by merely straightening said inclined horn 6. At the exit of the injection station, the conveyor 3, 4 passes about the downstream sprocket wheels 2 where, as clearly shown inFigure 1, the cups 5 open out to practically free the filled horns 6, which are then discharged with the aid of a rear series of air nozzles 19.This discharge zone is covered by a protection guard 20, and the filled horns 6 are collected on a transverse removal belt 21 which feeds them to the subsequent operating stations.The merits and advantages of the invention are clearly apparent from the aforegoing description and from a simple examination of the accompanying figures. The invention is not limited to the single embodiment illustrated and described, but comprises all technical equivalents of the aforesaid means and their combinations, provided they are implemented in accordance with the following claims.
