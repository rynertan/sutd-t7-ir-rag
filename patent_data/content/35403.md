# Voltage measuring instrument and preamplifier therefor.

## Abstract
The preampiifier for a voltage measuring instrument provides for noninteracting span and zero adjustments. Two voltage follower circuits are used and employ differential amplifiers 16 and 42 with negative feedback. The first produces a current througt the output resistor 58 of the preamplifier proportional to the voltage being measured while the second produces a current through the output resistor proportional to a fixed reference voltage REF. The proportionality of the first amplifier 16 is adjustable by a potentiometer 20 which modifies the feedback. This adjusts the span. The proportion of the reference voltage used as input to the second amplifier 42 is adjustable by a potentiometer 36 to adjust the zero. The feedback for the second amplifier is via a potential divider 46, 48 which may be connected to REF to achieve negative or positive zero offsets.
