## Description
TOTAL ESTRIOL FLUORESCENCE POLARIZATION IMMUNOQSSaY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field The present invention relates to a method and reagents for a fluorescence polarization immunoassay procedure for determining the amount of estriol and estriol conjugates in pregnancy serum, plasma, or urine. More specifically, the invention relates to reagents tracers and antibodies for determining the amount of estriol and estriol conjugates in a sample, immunogen compounds used to raise antibodies, and analytical methods for conducting the assay.Background Art The production of estriol by the fetus and placenta forms the basis of one of the most commonly used fetoplacental monitoring tests. Consistently low estriol leuels throughout pregnancy, or a sudden drop obserued in serial determinations, is associated with fetal distress. Leuels of estriol in serum and urine normally increase rapidly during the third trimester.In pregnancies complicated by conditions such as toxemia, hypertension, diabetes and post maturity syndrome, serial estriol determinations may be useful to assess fetal well being. One of the many functions of the liver is the conjugation of various drugs and physiological substances into sulfate and glucuronide deriuatiues. Estriol abbreuiated as E3 from the fetoplacental unit is conjugated in the maternal liver at the C 3 position with either sulfate E3 3S or glucuronide E3 3G and is conjugated with glucuronide at the C 16 position E3 16G a double conjugate hauing sulfate at the C 3 position and glucuronide at the C 16 position E3 3S 16G is also formed. Measurement of total estriol in a biological fluid requires quantification of both free11, or unconjugated, estriol and all estriol conjugates in that sample.Measurement af total urinary estriol , for example, predominantly reflects excretion of monoconjugated C 3 and C 16 glucuronides, which are not bound to albumin as are the sulfate conjugates that remain behind in plasma and constitute a major portion of total serum estriol11. In the past, total estriol levels have typically been measured by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , gas chromatography GC , enzyme immunoassay via and radioimmunoassay RIA .Generally, these methods employ an enzyme mixture containing both a ss glucuronidase and a sulfatase to hydrolyze the estriol conjugates prior to quantitation of total estriol. While reasonably specific for detecting estriol levels, these methods are not without drawbacks. High performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography require sample extraction procedures and the assay time is lengthy.Enzyme immunoassays are characterized by seueral disadvantages I the reagents are relatively unstable 2 any components in the biological samples which may influence the enzyme reaction in the assay such as enzyme inhibitors or enzymes which catalyze similar reactions will affect the assay results and 3 any compounds in the biological samples which may affect the absorbance measured in an enzyme immunoassay e.g., hemoglobin, bilirubin or other chromophores will affect the accuracy of the results. Radioimmunoassays are characterized by several disadvantages as well, including relatively short reagent shelf life due to isotopic decay and problems related to disposal of radioactive materials following use in the assay. In general, competitive binding immunoassays have prouided a preferable alternative to chemical methods such as gas chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography. Typically, competitiue binding immunoassays are used for measuring ligands in a test sample. For purposes of this disclosure, a ligand is a substance of biological interest to be determined quantitatively by a competitive binding immunoassay technique. The ligands compete with a labeled reagent, or ligand analog, or tracer, for a limited number of receptor binding sites on antibodies specific to the ligand and ligand analog.The concentration of ligand in the sample determines the amount of ligand analog which binds to the antibody the amount of ligand analog that will bind is inuersely proportional to the concentration of ligand in the sample, because the ligand and the ligand analog each bind to the antibody in proportion to their respectiue concentrations. Fluorescence polarization provides a quantitative means for measuring the amount of tracer antibody conjugate produced in a competitiue binding immunoassay. Fluorescence polarization techniques are based on the principle that a fluorescent labeled compound, when excited by plane polarized light, will emit fluorescence hauing a degree of polarization inversely related to its rate of rotation. Accordingly, when a tracer antibody conjugate hauing a fluorescent label is excited with plane polarized light, the emitted light remains highly polarized because the fluorophore is constrained from rotating between the time that light is absorbed and emitted.In contrast, when an unbound tracer is excited by plane polarized light, its rotation is much faster than that of the corresponding tracer antibody conjugate. Qs a result, the light emitted from the unbound tracer molecules is depolarized. Fluorescence polarization immunoassay techniques are well known in the art however, to date the use of such techniques for the determination oF total estriol levels has not been described. The present invention offers an aduance in the art in that highly accurate determinations of total estriol concentration in serum, plasma, or urine are obtainable with increased conuenience and without the disadvantages heretofore imposed by the various auailable assay systems. The assay conducted in accordance with the present invention is particularly accurate, as will be explained infra.SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a fluorescence polarization assay for total estriol to tracers, immunogens and antibodies for use in the assay and to analytical methods for conducting the assay. a first aspect of the invention relates to the discovery of certain tracers and immunogens hauing novel structures. according to this first aspect of the invention, both the tracers and immunogens can be represented by the structural formula shown in Figure 7 of the drawings, wherein R1 is H or R Z Q R2 andR3 are H when R1 is R Z Q and are taken together asR Z Q when R1 and R4 are H R4 is R Z Q when R1,R2 and R3 are H and is H when either R1 or R2 taken together with R3 is R Z Q Q is a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or another immunologically active carrier, or fluorescein or a fluorescein derivative Z is CO, NH, CH2NH or CS when Q is fluorescein or a fluorescein derivative and is N, NH,SO2, P02, PSO or a glucuronide moiety when Q is a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or another immunologically active carrier and R is a linking group including up to 7 heteroatoms when Q is a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or other immunologically active carrier and including up to 10 heteroatoms when Q is fluorescein or a fluorescein derivative, and hauing a total of fromO to 20 carbon atoms and heteroatoms arranged in a straight or branched chain and containing up to two ring structures. n second aspect of the invention relates to antibodies raised by the nouel immunogen. According to the second aspect of the invention, antibodies are prepared in response to a compound according to Claim 1 when Q is a poly amino acid or a derivative thereof or other immunologically active carrier. According to a third aspect of the invention, an immunogen is made by a method comprising the step of coupling a compound represented by the structural formula shown in Figure 7 wherein R1 is H or R X R2 and R3 are H when R1 is R X and are taken together as R X when R1 and R4 are H R4 is R X when R1,R2 and R3 are H and is H when either R1 or R2 taken together with R3 is R X X is NH2, S03H, PO3H, PSO H or a glucuronide moiety when R2, R3 and R4 are H, is NH2 or COOH when R1, R2 and R3 are H and isNH2 when R1 and R4 are H and R is a linking group including up to 7 heteroatoms and hauing a total of from 0 to 20 carbon atoms and heteroatoms arranged in a straight or branched chain and containing up to two ring structures with a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or another immunologically active carrier.

A fifth aspect of the invention relates to a reagent system for use in conducting a fluorescence polarization immunoassay comprising the combination of a nouel fluorescein tracer compound with an antibody hauing a cross reactivity with estriol1 estriol 3 sulfate and the nouel tracer compound of 100 10 . This cross reactivity of 9D 110 eliminates the need to enzymatically hydrolyze the sulfate conjugate to free estriol and thus makes possible for the first time a homogeneous fluorescence polarization immunoassay for total estriol, as will be explained infra. n sixth aspect of the invention relates to an improued process for measuring the concentration of total estriol. A sample is contacted with estriol antiserum. 13 glucuronidase, and a fluorescein containing estriol derivative capable of producing a detectable fluorescence polarization response to the presence of the estriol antiserum. Plane polarized light is then passed through the solution to obtain a fluorescence polarization response, and this response is detected as a measure of the amount of total estriol in the sample. Further objects and attendant aduantages of the invention will be best understood from a reading of the following detailed description taken together with the figures and the examples.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows the general structure of the estriol to be quantitatively determined in accordance with the present invention.

DETRILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention inuolues the use of fluorescein and derivatives of fluorescein. In particular, a necessary property of fluorescein and its derivatives for the usefulness of the tracer compounds is the fluorescence of fluorescein. Fluorescein exists in either of two tautomeric forms, depending on the acid concentration pH of the enuironment. In the open acid form, there are a number of conjugated double bonds which make that form of fluorescein and compounds containing a fluorescein moiety capable of absorbing blue light and emitting green fluorescence after an excited state lifetime of about four nanoseconds. When the open and closed forms coexist, the relative concentration of molecules in the open and closed forms is easily altered by adjustment of the pH level.Generally, the tracer compounds of the present invention exist in solution as biologically acceptable salts such as sodium1 potassium, ammonium and the like, allowing the compounds to exist in the open, fluorescent form, when employed in the analytical methods of the present invention. The specific salt present will depend on the buffer employed to adjust the pH level. For example, in the presence of a sodium phosphate buffer, the compounds of the present invention will generally exist in the open form, as a sodium salt. fis used herein, the term fluorescein, either as an individual compound or as a component of a larger compound, is meant to include both the open and closed forms, if they exist for a particular molecule, except in the context of fluorescence. Sn open form is necessary for the fluorescence to occur. The numbering of carbon atoms of the fluorescein molecule varies, depending upon whether the open or closed form of the molecule is considered.Rccordingly, the literature concerning fluorescein and its compounds is not uniform as to carbon atom numbering. The numbering system used herein is illustrated in Figure 8 as the lactone form of fluorescein. The tracers of the present invention will be referred to as 3 position, 6 position or 7 position tracers in accordance with this numbering system. n tracer in solution which is not complexed to an antibody is free to rotate in less than the time required for absorption and re emission of fluorescent light. As a result, the re emitted light is relatively randomly oriented so that the fluorescence polarization of a tracer not complexed to an antibody is low, approaching zero. Upon complexing with a specific antibody, the tracer antibody complex thus formed assumes the rotation of the antibody molecule which is slower than that of the relatively small tracer molecule, thereby increasing the polarization observed.Therefore, when a ligand competes with the tracer for antibody sites, the observed polarization of fluorescence of the resulting mixture of the free tracer and tracer antibody complex assumes a ualue interme,diate between that of the tracer and that of the tracer antibody complex. If a sample contains a high concentration of the ligand, the observed polarization value is closer to that of the free ligand, i.e., low.If the test sample contains a low concentration of the ligand, the polarization ualue is closer to that of the bound ligand, i.e., high. By sequentially exciting the reaction mixture of an immunoassay with vertically and then horizontally polarized light and analyzing only the vertically polarized component of the emitted light, the polarization of fluorescence in the reaction mixture may be accurately determined. The Reagents Both the immunogens and the tracers of the present invention can be represented by the general structural formula shown in Figure 7 of the drawings, wherein R1 is H or R Z Q R2 and R3 are H whenR1 is R Z Q and are taken together as R Z Q when R1 and R4 are H R4 is R Z Q when R1, R2 and R3 are H and is H when either R1 or R 2 taken together with R3 is R Z Q Q is a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or another immunologically active carrier, or fluorescein or a fluorescein derivative Z is CO, NH, CH2NH or CS when Q is fluorescein or a fluorescein derivative and is N, NH, S02, Pro,, PSO or a glucuronide moiety when Q is a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or another immunologically active carrier and R is a linking group including up to 7 heteroatoms when Q is a poly amino acid , a poly amino acid derivative or other immunologically active carrier and including up to 10 heteroatoms when Q is fluorescein or a fluorescein derivative, and having a total of fromO to 20 carbon atoms and heteroatoms arranged in a straight or branched chain and containing up to two ring structures. The objective is to haue competition between estriol including estriol 3 sulfate and the tracer for the recognition sites of the antibody. Great variations in the structure of the haptens and tracers are allowed in achieving this goal. For the purposes of this invention, haptens are precursors of the immunogens comprising generally a substituted estriol derivative bearing a group suitable for linking to an immunologically active carrier. The Structure of the Immunogens Usable antibodies can be produced from a uariety of estriol derivatives. Immunogens prepared from estriol compounds functionalized at the C 3, 6 or 7 position can produce antibodies in animals. Such antibodies are useful in a total estriol assay according to the invention when combined with an appropriate tracer. The immunogens of the present invention are derived from the general structure shown in Figure 4 and can be prepared by coupling a compound of the class shown with a poly amino acid or a derivative of a poly amino acid or other immunologically active carrier as will be discussed in the context of the synthetic method. In a preferred form of the invention1 the immunogen is prepared by coupling the aforedescribed substituted estriol compound with bouine serum albumin.Various other protein carriers may also be used to good advantage, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, egg albumin, bouine gamma globulin, thyroxine binding globulin, and so forth. Slternatiuely, synthetic poly amino acids hauing a sufficient number of auailable amino groups can be employed, as can other synthetic or natural polymeric materials bearing functional groups reactive with estriol.The Structure of the Tracers The tracers of the present invention have the general formula shown in Figure 7. The tracer is an estriol derivative that is linked to a fluorescein derivative by, for example, an amido aminoalkyl, thiourea, ether, thioether, or oximo group, as will be discussed in the context of the synthetic method. By way of example1 any of the following fluorescein derivatives can be used F1 NH2 fluorescein amine F1 CO2H carboxyfluorescein Fl NHCOCH2 I iodacetamidofluoresceinEMI12.1 tb SEP Fl NHCOCH28r tb SEP L tb tb bromoacetamidofluorescein DTAF 2, 4 dichloro 1,3,5, triazin 2 ylamino fluorescein 4 chloro 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 ylamino fluorescein F1 NCS fluorescein thioisocyanate F1 CH2NH2 4 aminomethylfluoresceinThe antibodies The antibodies of the present invention are prepared by eliciting a response in rabbits to the immunogens described supra. The immunogen is administered to animals or to in vitro cultures of immunocompetent cells by a series of inoculations, in a manner well known to those skilled in the art. It should be understood that although rabbits were the preferred immune host to estriol immunogens in the experiments detailed herein, any in vivo or in vitro host capable of producing antibodies to the structures herein outlined may be employed. Svnthesis of the Immunogens The immunogens of the present invention are prepared by coupling a hapten having the general structure of Figure 7 wherein R1 is H or R X R2 andR3 are H when R1 is R X and are taken together asR X when R1 and R4 are H R4 is R X when R1, R2 and R3 are H and is H when either R or R2 taken together with R3 is R X X is NH2, S03, P04, PS03 or a glucuronide moiety and R is a linking group including up to 7 heteroatoms and hauing a total of from 0 to 20 carbon atoms and heteroatoms arranged in a straight or branched chain and containing up to two ring structures to a poly amino acid , poly amino acid derivative or other immunologically active carrier. The hapten can be linked to the carrier by an amide or amide like linkage. In a preferred embodiment, the carrier is bouine serum albumin and the hapten has the structure ofFigure 7 where R1 is H, R2 is N O CH2COOH, andR3 is H. The hapten is coupled to the poly amino acid or other carrier through its acid group. This group can be activated either prior to its addition to the carrier or in situ with the carrier1 utilizing well known carbodiimide procedures and reagents such asN,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. In a preferred embodiment, the hapten is activated prior to its addition to the carrier by means ofN,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N hydroxysuccinimide in an organic medium. The actiuated hapten is added to a carrier which has been dissolved in suitable buffer, e.g., phosphate or borate, at suitable pH, usually between 6 and 9. The 3 position haptens utilized in immunogen preparation are synthesized by refluxing estriol together with a haloalkanoic ester and a suitable base.The ester is hydrolyzed by base, reuealing the free carboxylic acid function. Other 3 position haptens, such as the deriuatives of sulfonates, phosphonates and glucuronides, could be utilized in the preparation of immunogens according to the present invention, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The 6 position haptens utilized in immunogen preparation were made using a modification of the method of E.P. Burrows, D.L. di Pietro and H.E. Smith, Journal of Organic Chemistrv, 37, 4000 1972 to convert estriol to its 6 keto triacetate derivative. The method of E.Kuss and R. Goebel, Steroids, 511, 1972 conuerted the 6 ketoestriol triacetate to estriol 6carboxymethyloxime. The 7 position haptens utilized in immunogen preparation were prepared by reduction of the aforementioned 6 ketoestriol triacetate, using sodium borohydride, to the corresponding 6 hydroxy compound.Dehydration and reacetylation yielded 6 dehydroestriol triacetate. Addition of methyl 3 mercaptopropionate to the double bond, according to the method of C.E. Cook,G.R. Tallent, and H.P. Christensen, Life Sciences, 14,1075 1974 , gave 7 2 methoxycarbonylethylmercapto estriol triacetate. Hydrolysis of this compound yielded 7 2 carboxyethylmercapto estriol. Svnthesis of the Tracers The tracers of the present invention are prepared by coupling a fluorescein moiety, or a derivative of fluorescein, to the general structure shown in Figure 7, wherein R1 is H or R Y R2 andR3 are H when R1 is R Y and are taken together asR Y when R1 and R4 are H R4 is R Y when R R2 and R3 are H and is H when either R1 or R taken together with R3 is R Y Y is NH,, COOH, SO3H, SO2Cl, SH, CHO, CN,OH or a glucuronide moiety and R is a linking group including up to 10 heteroatoms and having a total of from 0 to 20 carbon atoms and heteroatoms arranged in a straight or branched chain and containing up to two ring structures. In the presently preferred embodiment, the fluorescein derivative is 5 carboxyfluorescein, prepared as in Example 1. This is coupled to a precursor of the general structure of Figure 7, wherein R is CH2CO NH CH2CH2NH2 and R2 R3 and 4 areH, by first forming the active ester of 5 carboxyfluorescein. The preferred active ester is theN hydroxysuccinimide active ester, and the preferred coupling method is uia N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide activation in dry N,N dimethylformamide. Other activating groups such as N hydroxybenzotriazole and pentachlorophenol and solvents such as pyridine, acetonitrile, and dioxane can be used.The reactants are preferably coupled under conditions for forming amide linkages, and it is most preferred that active ester procedures be used. Usable tracers can be prepared from a variety of estriol derivatives. Estriol derivatives with terminal amino groups are synthesized by coupling the terminal carboxylic acid groups with diamines, such as ethylenediamine and piperazine, using the aforementioned carbodiimide procedures. Active ester is prepared from the carboxylic acid group and then reacted with the diamine using well known methods for preparing amide bonds. The amine or imine is then coupled to fluorescein derivatives having functionalities reactive toward amines or imines, e.g., carboxyfluorescein active esters, fluorescein isothiocyanates, 2,4 dichloro 1,3 ,5 triazine 2 ylaminofluorescein, or alkoxy 2,4 dichloro 1,3,5 triazine 2 ylaminofluorescein. Estriol derivatives with an acid group, e.g., carboxylic acid, sulfonate, phosphonate or glucuronide, are coupled to fluorescein derivatives having functionalities reactive toward these acids, e.g., aminofluorescein, 4 aminomethylfluorescein, or a nouel class ofN alkylated 4 aminomethylfluorescein compounds claimed in U.S. Patent Rpplication filed concurrently herewith . The method of coupling is preferably the aforementioned carbodiimide procedure.The Assay The particular tracers1 antibodies and ss glucuronidase enzyme of the present invention haue been found to accurately and specifically measure levels of total estriol levels in serum, plasma and urine.Figure 1 shows the structure of estriol. Figure 2 indicates the positions at which estriol is conjugated.Figure 3 shows the structure of estriol 3 sulfate.Figures 4, 5 and 6 show the other forms of conjugated estriol which commonly occur, described supra. The assay of the present invention provides a more rapid and conuenient total estriol assay method than prior art methods1 in that the system requires no specimen treatment before analysis, utilizes reagents that are chemically and thermally stable, and eliminates the need for enzyme hydrolysis of estriol 3 sulfate conjugates. In accordance with the analytical methods of the present invention, i.e., the methods of determining total estriol by a fluorescence immunoassay procedure using the tracer compounds and immunogens of the invention, a sample containing or suspected of containing estriol is intermixed with a biologically acceptable salt of a tracer, an antibody specific to estriol, estriol 3 sulfate and the tracer1 and B glucuronidase. The antibody is produced using the immunogen as described above. The ss glucuronidase enzyme conuerts estriol glucuronide to free estriol.The free estriol and estriol 3 sulfate then compete with the tracer for limited antibody sites, resulting in the formation of complexes. By maintaining constant the concentration of tracer and antibody, the ratio of estriol and estriol 3 sulfate antibody complex to tracer antibody complex that is formed is directly proportional to the total amount of estriol in the sample. Therefore, upon exciting the mixture with linearly polarized light and measuring the polarization of the fluorescence emitted by a tracer and a tracer antibody complex1 one is able to determine quantitatively the total amount of estriol in the sample. The results can be quantified in terms of net millipolarization units, span in millipolarization units and relative intensity. The measurement of millipolarization units indicates the maximum polarization when a maximum amount of the tracer is bound to the antibody in the absence of any estriol or estriol 3 sulfate. The higher the net millipolarization units, the better the binding of the tracer to the antibody. The span is an indication of the difference between the net millipolarizations at the points of maximum and minimum amount of tracer bound to the antibody. Q larger span prouides for a better numerical analysis of data. The intensity is a measure of the strength of the signal aboue background. Thus, a higher intensity will give a more accurate measurement.The intensity is determined at about 0.5 to 2.0 nanomolar for the preferred tracers of the invention, as the sum of the uertically polarized intensity plus twice the horizontally polarized intensity. The intensity of the tracer signal can range from about three times to about thirty times the background noise, depending upon the concentration of the tracer and other assay variables. For the purposes of the present invention, an intensity of at least eight to ten times that of background noise is preferred. Tables I, II and III show the results obtained with various embodiments of the present invention in terms of span and estriol 3 sulfate cross reactivity.Table I shows data for as says produced by pairing antiserum raised against estriol 6 carboxymethyloximebouine serum albumin with two of the novel tracers of this invention, one 3 position tracer and one 6 position tracer. Table II shows that several of the 3 position tracers of this invention can be employed with appropriate antisera raised against immunogens of the prior art. Table III shows results for antisera from three different types of animals rabbits, goats and sheep prepared from a 7 position immunogen and paired with a 7 position tracer.

Similarly, antisera 10 and 16, when used in conjunction with estriol 3 carboxymethylether ethylenediamine 5 carboxyfluorescein, resulted in a signal to noise ratio 10, span greater than 100, and cross reactivity of 100 .

For instance, appropriate amounts of goat antiserum B and sheep antiserum a could be combined to form an antiserum with the desired cross reactivity.

For a given antiserum, changing the tracer may greatly alter the cross reactivity. By trial and error in selecting among uarious tracers and antisera, appropriate combinations facilitating 100 estriol 3 sulfate cross reactivity can be found. The preferred embodiment of Table III is the combination of estriol 3 carboxymethylether ethylenediamine 5 carboxyfluorescein with antiserum 16, which was raised against estriol 6 carboxymethyloximebovine serum albumin immunogen. Thus, an important aspect of the invention lies in the discovery that certain preferred combinations of specific estriol tracers and specific anti estriol antisera possess approximately 100 cross reactivity to estriol 3 sulfate. Tracer and antiserum combinations hauing either much less than or much greater than 100 cross reactivity to estriol 3 sulfate are not useful in a total estriol fluorescence polarization immunoassay. How closely the estriol 3 sulfate cross reactivity needs to approach 100 will depend upon the fraction of estriol 3 sulfate derivatives in the particular sample to be tested as well as the accuracy required in a given circumstance. For instance, in urine samples, estriol 3 sulfate derivatives constitute only about 14 of the total estriol conjugates. If the estriol 3 sulfate cross reactivity of a tracer antiserum combination is only 50 , the error in measurement or recovery will be 50 x .14, or 7 . In contrast, for serum samples, in which estriol 3 sulfate derivatives constitute 55 of the total conjugates, a 27.5 error will result from the use of the same tracer antiserum combination. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine the cross reactivity required for a specific application.In most instances, an antiserum tracer pair yielding a cross reactivity of 100 10 will be preferred. In addition to possessing excellent cross reactivity to estriol 3 sulfate, the estriol tracer and anti estriol antiserum combinations of the present invention must be characterized by minimal cross reactivity to other steroids. Table IV illustrates the specificity results obtained with the preferred embodiment of the invention. Cross reactivity was tested with other steroids whose chemical structure could potentially cause interference with the total estriol assay. Cross reactivity of a compound was determined by assaying estriol free pooled human serum spiked to uarious concentrations of the steroid to be tested. Percent cross reactivity 100 x measured concentration of total estriol divided by the concentration of the test material .

This is a distinct advantage ouer heterogeneous immunoassay procedures wherein the bound tracer must be separated from the unbound tracer before a reading can be taken. The pH at which the method of the present invention is practiced must be sufficient to allow the fluorescein moiety of the tracers to exist in their open form. The pH may range from about 5 to 10, more preferably in the range of from about 6 to 9, and most desirably from about 7.0 to 7.5. Relatively small changes in pH radically affect the intensity and special characteristics of fluorescence. The use of sulfatase enzymes to hydrolyze estriol sulfate conjugates to free estriol is the current method of choice in commercial radioimmunoassays for quantitation of free estriol. The optimal pH for sulfatase enzymes is pH 5.5 thus, the radioimmunoassays utilize a buffer system at this pH to maximize enzyme efficiency. The pH activity profile for sulfatase enzymes falls off sharply at pH 6 with a loss of greater than 95 of its activity at pH 7.3. This nonouerlapping pH optimum for the sulfatase enzyme and the fluorescein tracer precludes their combined use in a homogeneous immunoassay for total estriol. Various buffers may be used to achieue and maintain the pH of the homogeneous immunoassay of the present invention during the assay procedure.Representative buffers include borate, citrate, acetate phosphate, carbonate, tris, barbital and the like. The particular buffer employed is not critical to the present invention, but the tris and phosphate buffers are preferred. The cation portion of the buffer will generally determine the cation portion of the tracer salt in solution. The reagents for the fluorescence polarization assay of the present invention comprise antibody specific for estriol and tracer. Additionally, largely conuentional solutions including an estriol pretreatment solution, a dilution buffer, estriol calibrators and esriol controls are desirably prepared. Typical solutions of these reagents, some of which are described herein, are commercially available in assay kits from Nbbott Laboratories, Nbbott Park, Illinois. All percentages expressed herein are weight uolume unless otherwise indicated. The tracer formulation presently preferred is 70 nanomolar tracer in 0.1 molar tris buffer at pH 5.5, 20 sodium salicylate, and 0.1 sodium azide. The antiserum formulation comprises rabbit serum diluted with 0.1 molar phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, 0.1 sodium azide, 14,000 Fishman units of ss glucuronidase from E. coli, and 40 sucrose. The dilution buffer comprises 0.1 molar sodium phosphate at pH 7.5, 0.1 sodium azide, and 0.01 bouine gamma globulin. The pretreatment formulation comprises 20 sodium salicylate and 0.1 sodium azide. Calibrators comprising estriol in phosphate buffered saline at concentrations of 0.0, 30, 60, 105, 210 and 420 ng ml with 0.1 sodium azide preservative are useful.Controls comprising estriol 16 glucuronide in phosphate buffered saline are prouided at concentrations of 45, 150 and 300 ng ml with 0.1 sodium azide as a preservative. The preferred procedure is especially designed to be used in conjunction with the Abbott TDXD polarization analyzer available from abbot Laboratories, Irving, Texas. Fifty microliters of serum or plasma are required. The calibrators, controls, or unknown samples are pipetted directly into the sample well of the TDxs sample cartridge. One of the advantages of this procedure is that the sample does not require any special preparation.If a TDxs estriol assay kit is being used with the TDx analyzer, samples are placed directly into a sample carousel, the caps from each of the three reagent containers in the kit are removed and placed into designated wells inside the TDxe analyzer, and the assay procedure from this point is fully automated. If a manual assay is being performed, then the sample is mixed with the pretreatment solution in dilution buffer and a bac kground reading is taken. The tracer is then mixed with the assay. The antibody is then finally mixed into the test solution. Nfter incubation, a fluorescence polarization reading is taken. The fluorescence polarization ualue of each calibrator, control or sample is determined and is printed on the output tape of an instrument such as theAbbott TDxo polarization analyzer. A standard curue is generated in the instrument by plotting the polarization of each calibrator uersus its concentration using nonlinear regression analysis. The concentration of each control or sample is read off the stored calibration curue and printed on the output tape. With respect to the foregoing preferred procedure, it should be noted that the tracer, antibody, pretreatment solution, calibrators and controls should be stored between about 2 and about 8 degrees C, while the dilution buffer should be stored at ambient temperature. n standard curve and controls should be run euery two weeks, with each calibrator and control run in duplicate. Controls should be run daily and all samples can be run in replicates if so desired. It should be understood that the foregoing detailed description and the following examples are intended to be illustratiue, but not limiting, with respect to the scope of the present invention. Various modifications will become apparent to one skilled in the art, and thus it is intended that the scope of the invention be defined solely by the claims and legal equivalents thereof.

Estriol 3 carboxymethylether ethylenediamine 5carboxyfluorescein was synthesized as described in Example 1. Ten mg of this tracer was dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol. Three l,l of the resulting stock tracer solution was diluted into 10 ml of 20 sodium solicylate to give a tracer concentration of 70 nanomolar. Antiserum 16 Table I was diluted in 100 ml of phosphate buffer pH 6.2 containing 40 sucrose and 14,000 modified Fishman units of E. coli ss glucuronidase obtained from Sigma Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri to hydrolyze the estriol glucuronide. One Sigma or modifiedFishman unit will liberate 1.0 g of phenolphthalein from phenolphthalein glucuronide per hour at 370 C in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 . 25 1 of antiserum reagent 16 and 7 1 of sample were mixed together with 500 pl of dilution buffer comprising 0.1 molar sodium phosphate at pH 7.5, 0.1 sodium azide, and 0.01 bouine gamma globulin pH 7.3 in the predilution well of an Abbott TDx polarization analyzer. 175 1 of this prediluted sample and antiserum mixture was then transferred to a cuvette together with 25 1 of 20 sodium salicylate and 925 Ul of the aforementioned dilution buffer. Nfter a 10 minute incubation period, a fluorescent sample background reading was taken. 175 ul of prediluted sample was next transferred into a cuvette together with 25 1 of the estriol 3 carboxymethylether ethylenediamine 5 carboxyfluorescein tracer and 925 ul of the dilution buffer. Rafter a 4 minute incubation period, a final reading is taken and estriol concentration values are printed off a stored standard curve.

GRAPH I M. POLARIZATION EMI47.1 NG ML Example 19 Example 18 was repeated, with substitution of the estriol 6 carboxymethyloxime 4 N ethylaminomethylfluorescein tracer prepared in Example 6 for the estriol 3 carboxymethylether ethylenediamine 5 carboxyfluorescein tracer and substitution of antiserum 12 for antiserum 16. As Table I indicates, this combination also yielded 100 cross reactivity. Example 20 Example 18 was repeated with substitution of antiserum 10 for antiserum 16. as Table I indicates, this combination also yielded 100 cross reactivity. Example 21 Example 18 was repeated except that a pool of antisera from four rabbits No. 2, 10, 13, 16 , each hauing estriol 3 sulfate cross reactivity less than, equal to, or greater than 100 , was substituted for antiserum 16. The pooling procedures was as follows Antiserum having less than 100 cross reactivity rabbit No. 2 was combined with antiserum hauing greater than 100 cross reactivity rabbit No. 13 until the combined estriol 3 sulfate cross reactivity was equal to 100 . This pool of antisera was then combined with a pool of antisera that originally had 100 cross reactivity rabbitNos. 10 and 16 . Preparation of a binding inhibition standard curve, similar to that shown in Example 18, showed the same inhibition for both estriol and estriol 3 sulfate. The accuracy of the assay was also verified by correlation with other assays. Both serum and urine specimens covering a broad range of total estriol values were used.
