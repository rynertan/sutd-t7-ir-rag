# Electric cable terminations.

## Abstract
In a termination for a fluid filled cable, the insulator 2 has an imperforate metal end fitting 3 so that the risk of leakage of fluid into or out of the cable is negligible, whichever direction the pressure differential may be in this makes the termination especially suitable for pressurised gas switch gear. A terminal 6 on the cable conductor end is connected to the end fitting 3 by a plug and socket joint 4 and 5, and there is also a direct shoulder to shoulder engagement to transmit compressive forces. A latching mechanism comprising for example retractable pins 7 which ride up camming surfaces 10 and engage shoulders behind them, holds the plug and socket engaged against tensile forces.

## Description
ELECTRIC CABLE TERiINATIONS This invention relates to electric cable terminations, and more particularly to terminations for fluid filled oil or gas filled cables. As used herein, the expression termination includes a fluid tight joint between two such cables allowing them to operate at different pressures. More especially, but not exclusively, it relates to terminations that are suitable for terminating such cables into pressurised chambers, such as the enclosures of switchgear filled with sulphur hexafluoride, nitrogen or other insulating gas under pressure, or into oilfilled chambers, as of transformers. It is a requirement in such terminations to maintain a fluid tight seal between the fluid in the cable and that in the pressurised chamber or otherwise adjoining the termination including the ambient atmosphere . In current practice this is done by enclosing the end of the cable in a tubular insulator through the free end of which a conductive fitting on the end of the cable conductor passes and to which it is clamped and sealed using elastomeric sealing rings. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that there is a small but not negligible risk of leakage, and this often imposes a requirement for the pressure in the end portion of the cable to be higher than that of the adjoining fluid, which often means higher than the pressure at which the remainder of the cable operates.This can only be done by adding to the system a stop joint to delimit the high pressure section of the cable and a special, high pressure fluid tank with associated ducting, and is likely to require also a section of cable with a specially strong sheath. Attempts have been made to overcome these problems by providing an imperforate metal end fitting on the insulator, so effecting a reliable fluid tight seal, and then connecting the cable conductor to that end fitting internally by a plug andsocket connection. Such attempts have failed hitherto owing to the considerable longitudinal forces to which such terminations are subject a typical oil filled cable, with a conductor cross 2 section of 2000 mm , may be subject to thermal and other compresive forces of up to around 6xlO N 6 tonnes weight and tensile forces up to around 10 N 1 tonne . In accordance with the present invention, a fluid filled cable termination comprises a tubular insulator open at one end and including an imperforate metallic end fitting that forms a fluid tight seal at the other end, this tubular insulator surrounding an end portion of the cable from which the sheath has been removed a terminal on the end of the cable conductor inside the tubular insulator a plug and socket connection between the said end fitting and the terminal a pair of bearing surfaces, one on the terminal and one on the tubular insulator, that engage to transmit compressive forces resilient latching means on the tubular insulator and the terminal which transmit tensile forces when engaged and a fluid tight seal between the open end of the tubular insulator and the sheath of the cable. Preferably the shoulder on the insulator is formed as part of the metallic end fitting, but it could be on the insulating body thereof if it is sufficiently strong. Similarly the part of the resilient latching means carried by the insulator is preferably but not necessarily on the metallic end fitting. Preferably the latching means is releasable so as to allow the termination to be dismantled for inspection, cleaning, the replacement of faulty parts etc, but this is not essential in all cases. A preferred latching mechanism comprises at least one locking member moveable transversely of the cable axis in a guideway in one of the parts and biassed by a spring or other means towards the other part, which has a camming surface positioned to move the locking member against the biassing force during assembly until the locking member passes over a shoulder on the said other member and then release it into contact with that shoulder.Preferably the shoulder and the camming surface are annular except for the provision of at least one gap for the or for each locking member which is not normally aligned with the locking member but which can be brought into alignment with the locking member by relative rotation between the insulator and the cable end to release the latching engagement when required.Preferably there are at least two locking members and when there is more than one they are preferably symmetrically arranged about the cable axis. Preferably the guideway is in the terminal rather than in the insulator. The invention is illustrated by the drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal crosssection of the distinctive end portion of a preferred form of termination in accordance with the invention FIGURE 2 is a further cross section, on a larger scale, showing the latching mechanism in more detail FIGURE 3 is a transverse cross section on the line III III in figure 1 not shown to scale and FIGURE 4 is a sketch showing one particular application of the termination, namely in termination of an oil filled cable to switchgear filled with a compressed gas. In the drawings, the cable end 1 from which the sheath has been removed is enclosed by the tubular insulator 2 incorporating metal end fitting 3 hermetically sealed to the body of the insulator for example the end fitting may be of aluminium and directly embedded in a cast epoxy resin body. The end fitting 3 forms a socket 4 which receives a plug 5 of conventional design on the terminal 6, which is crimped or otherwise connected to the cable conductor. The terminal 6 also supports two locking member in the form of pins 7 figures 2 and 3 located diametrically opposite each other. Each pin is biassed outwardly by a spring 8 but is completely retractable into a cylindrical guideway 9 in the terminal 6. During assembly, the insulator is suitably oriented and presented axially to the terminal on the prepared cable end. The plug 5 and socket 4 engage first and ensure that the latching pins operate independently and are equally loaded.Each pin first engages a respective adjacent part of a generally annular camming surface 10 which causes it to be retracted into its guideway 9 until it passes over and engages a locking shoulder 11 which it thereafter engages to secure the termination against withdrawal of the plug from the socket. Simultaneously shoulders 12 and 13 figure 2 are engaged to transmit compressive forces. To withdraw the plug from the socket if required, the insulator is rotated after freeing its other end from the cable sheath to bring the latching pins into the position shown in figure 3 in which they are aligned with channels 14 extending through the solid annulus otherwise bounded by the shoulder 11 and camming surface 10. Figure 4 shows a take off connector adaptor 15 mounted on the end fitting 3 with screws 16, for making a connection from an oil filled cable to a bus bar, for instance in switchgear filled with compressed gas. By using a range of simple adaptors such as the one shown, a common insulator may be used to meet the requirements of a wide range of switchgear and other equipment.Maximum versatility in this respect is secured by making the metal end fitting 3 as short as possible. A secondary benefit of the invention is that a drop out valve 17 figure 2 is accessible for maintenance if required.
