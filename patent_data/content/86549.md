# Apparatus and process for the treatment of molten metal.

## Abstract
A treatment unit is disclosed which comprises a pour ing bush 1 opening directly or indirectly into an additive container 3 holding a reactive additive such as a nodulariz ing agent and which has an aperture at the top of its peripheral walls 7c and optionally one or more other aper tures 7 in its peripheral walls to allow the passage there through of molten metal. The additive container is housed within a covered jacket or funnel 4 for restricting contact of molten metal being treated with the atmosphere. The aperture at the top of the peripheral walls of the additive container may be in the form of an annular gap 7b between the top of the additive container and either the bottom of the pouring bush or a cover provided for the funnel or jacket.
