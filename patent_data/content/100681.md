## Description
IMPROVED SILICONE RUBBER DRIVE BELT AND AN APPARATUS FOR THERMAL DEVELOPMENT OF A PHOTOGRAPHIC MEDIUM USING SAID DRIVE BELT Background of the InventionField of the Invention The subject matter of the present invention pertains to an improved silicone rubber drive belt for use in an apparatus for thermal development of a photographic medium using said drive belt.Description of the Prior Art Various apparatus is used for producing a hard copy reproduction of an image displayed on a cathode ray tube CRT . One such apparatus utilizes a fiber optic CRT to produce said hard copy reproduction through thermal development of a special photographic medium. A processor assembly drives said photographic medium in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the fiber opticCRT. As the photographic medium moves in said direction across the outer faceplate of the fiber optic CRT, the line of image information on said fiber optic CRT is transferred to the photographic medium adjacent thereto.Eventually, as said processor assembly drives said photographic medium in the direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the fiber optic CRT, each line of image information displayed on the fiber optic CRT is transferred to the photographic medium. The processor assembly includes a drive belt stretched to extend between two drive rollers and an idler roller. One surface of the drive belt faces one surface of a heater platen. Disposed between the drive belt and the heater platen is the photographic medium, the drive belt moving the photographic medium in the direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the fiber optic CRT. The known processor assembly experiences a very short operating life, due to elongation of the drive belt. In addiction, the photographic medium exudes a chemical exudate, the exudate being absorbed into the drive belt causing the drive belt to swell, to soften and to stick to portions of the heater platen. Summary of the Invention It is a priinair object of the present invention to eliminate the deficiencies associated with the drive belt of the prior art contained within the processor assembly thereby improving the reliability and the performance of the drive belt and therefore the processor assembly. The object of the present invention is accompl shed by impreg nating the drive belt with a filler element, such as carbon black for optimizing the belt s resistance to stretching, swelling, and softening without producing undesirable side effects, and by disposing on one side of said drive belt, adjacent to the heater platen, a hard coating, or a lubricating film, or both for reducing the friction between the drive belt and the heater platen or between the drive belt and the photographic medium. Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the details of the description and the specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description. Brief Description of the Drawings A full understanding of the present invention will be obtained from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and thus are not limitative of the present invention, and wherein FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus for producing a hard copy reproduction of an image displayed on a fiberoptic CRT, the apparatus including the processor assembly having the drive belt disposed therein. FIG. 2 illustrates in cross section the drive belt according to the present invention, as illustrated inFIG. 1. FIG. 3 illustrates in cross section another embodiment of the drive belt according to the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 1. Description of the Preferred Embodiment FIG. 1 illustrates one apparatus for producing a hard copy reproduction of an image displayed on a fiberoptic CRT. In FIG. 1, the apparatus 10 includes a storage canister lOA for storing the photographic medium therein, such as photographic paper lOAl. When the photographic paper is removed from the canister lOA, it is disposed in contact with and adjacent to a first idler roller lOB. The photographic paper lOAl moves in contact the first idler roller lOB. Following the first idler roller, the photographic paper lOAl is disposed between and in contact with a foam pressure roller lOC and the outer faceplate of the fiber optic CRT lOD.As the photographic paper lOAl moves across the outer faceplate of the fiber optic CRT, the image displayed on the CRT is transferred to the photographic paper lOAl. The paper lOAl is then disposed between a pinch roller lOE and a first drive roller lOF. The driver roller lOF aids in driving the belt in the direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the fiber optic CRT lOD. The paper lOAl then moves in said direction beyond a paper cutter stationary blade lOG and a paper cutter rotary blade lOH.The photographic paper then moves into the processor assembly 10I. The processor assembly 10I includes a heater platen C, two drive rollers D and E, a second idler roller F, and the drive belt A processor belt stretched to extend between the second idler roller F, the drive roller E, on one end, and the drive rollerD on the other end. The photographic paper lOAl is disposed between the drive belt A and the heater platen C, the drive belt A driving the photographic paper in said direction indicated by arrow 10I1 transverse to the longitudinal axis of the fiber optic CRT lOD.The photographic paper lOAl then comes into contact with a processor rear paper guide 103 which guides the photographic paper lOAl into a position disposed between the two belts lOKl and 10K2 of conveyor 10K. The drive rollers D and E, in addition to the drive roller lOF, drive the photographic paper lOAl from its storage canister 10A, past the fiber optic CRT lOD, through the processor 10I, to the conveyor 10K which moves it to the front panel lOL, where it exits from the apparatus. However, the operating life and the reliability of the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 has been severely reduced due to certain undesirable characteristics associated with the processor belt A. The belt A would stretch and elongate, thereby reducing the tension of the belt between the drive rollers D and E. In addition, the belt would soften, swell, and become very sticky. The belt A stretches due to an inherent lack of stiffness qualities associated therewith. The belt becomes soft, swells, and is sticky as a result of a chemical exudate exuded from the photographic paper lOAl when the paper comes into contact with the drive belt A. For example, the photographic paper 10A exudes stearic acid and water, major constituents of the chemical exudate referred to hereinabove.The stearic acid and water exudate produces the softness qualities of the belt and also produces the stickiness qualities associated with the surface of the belt which contacts the photographic paper and the heater platen. These disadvantages associated with the drive belt A of the prior art have been eliminated by virtue of a new drive belt, the qualities and characteristics of the new drive belt being described in the paragraphs hereinbelow. Referring to FIG. 2, the new drive belt A according to the present invention is illustrated. In FIG. 2, the drive belt A comprises a first section Al, the first section being a cured silicone rubber layer impregnated with 26 32 parts by weight of a filler element, such as carbon black. The filler element must be resistant to the chemical exudate stearic acid and water exuded from the photographic paper lOAl and it must produce a stiffness or hardness quality in the cured silicone rub ber layer. In addition, the filler element must be electrically conductive. As a result of the impregnation of the first section Al the cured silicone rubber by the filler element, the new drive belt A exhibits a stiffness characteristic.The hardness of the cured silicone rubber layer constituting section Al is increased relative to the prior art drive belt to 60 points shore A or greater as a result of said impregnation.This reduces the propensity of the drive belt A to stretch. As a result of said impregnation, the capacity of the belt to absorb the chemical exudate exuded from the photographic paper lOAl is reduced. This reduces the propensity of the belt to soften and swell. The new drive belt A further comprises a second section A2, the second section being a hard coating disposed in contact with the first section Al. The hard coating must have a characteristic whereby the friction between the new beltA and the heater platen C or between the new belt A and the photographic paper lOAl is reduced. This reduction in friction reduces the probability that the drive beltA will stick to the heater platen C and reduces the power required to drive the drive belt A via the drive rollers D and E.As a result, the image quality of the image transferred to the photographic paper lOAl, by the fiber optic CRT lOD, is improved. One example of a hard coating which may be used for section A2 shown in FIG. 2 is Dow Corning 1 2577 conformal silicone coating. The hard coating comprising the second section A2 of the new belt A should be approximately 1 2 to 1 mil in thickness. Referring to FIG. 3, an alternative embodiment of the new drive belt A according to the present invention is illustrated. In FIG. 3, the new drive belt A comprises the first section Al, the second section A2 disposed over said first section, the first and second sections Al and A2 of the new drive belt A being described in the paragraphs hereinabove with reference to FIG. 2 of the drawings. However, in addition to the first and second sections Al and A2, a third section A3 is disposed over and is in contact with said second sectionA2, the third section A3 being a lubricating film for still further lowering the friction between the drive belt A and the heater platen C or between the drive beitt A and the photographic paper medium lOAl.Molybdenum disulphide powder is one example of the lubricating film which may be used as the third section A3. If desired, either the hard coating characterized by the second section A2 or the lubricating film characterized by the third section A3 may be disposed over the first section Al. Alternatively, the second and third sections A2 and A3 may be used together as two separate layers, or mixed together as one layer, and disposed over and in contact with the first section Al.The choice of the use of either section A2, or sectionA3, or both sections A2 and A3 to be disposed over the first section Al depends upon the frictional characteristics of the drive belt path. It should be emphasized that the new drive belt A of the present invention may comprise the first sectionAl in combination with the second section A2 or the coF bination of the first and second sections Al and A2, further in combination with the third section A3. In t former combination the first and second sections Al ardA2 , the operating life of the processor assembly 101 associated with the apparatus shown in FIG. 1 is greats increased. However, in order to further increase the operating life of the processor assembly 10I, relative to the former combination, the latter combination the combined sections Al, A2, and A3 must be utilized. Con sistent test results are achieved in demonstrating this greater operating life when the latter combination comprises the new drive belt A. The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the scope of the invention and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.
