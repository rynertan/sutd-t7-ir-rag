# Sterile docking process, apparatus and system for thermoplastic resin tubes.

## Abstract
A process, apparatus and system for making a sterile connection between two thermoplastic resin tubes 11, 12 is disclosed. A hot stream of fluid 19 is urged either through both said tubes 11, 12 transversely of the axis of each tube or through opposing side sections of the tubes substantially per pendicular to the axes of the tubes to form continuous contact between the hot fluid stream, the interior of the tubes 11, 12 and molten tube portions thereby formed. The tubes 11, 12 are aligned with each other, if necessary, and urged together while the hot fluid stream is removed. As the thermoplastic res in cools a sterile weld is formed.
