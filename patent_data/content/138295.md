## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESS This invention relates to a chemical process and more particularly to a method for the preparation of monocarboxylic acids and the esters and nitriles thereof. It is known to make a, ss unsaturated acids and the esters and nitriles thereof, often accompanied by the corresponding saturated compounds, by reacting alkanoic acids or the esters or nitriles thereof with formaldehyde in the presence of alkaline catalysts.Thus, US Patent No. 3,247,248 describes the vapour phase reaction between formaldehyde and acetic or prop ionic acid in the presence of a catalyst such as an alkali metal aluminosilicate to give, respectively, acrylic or methacrylic acid. The formaldehyde may be used in the form of paraformaldehyde or trioxane or a commercially available aqueous or alcoholic solution. A solution of formaldehyde in methanol is specifically mentioned but it is pointed out that alcoholic solutions of formaldehyde may have some disadvantages such as side reactions when substantial amounts of alcohol are present in the feed mixture. It is also known to use methylal the dimethylacetal of formaldehyde in place of formaldehyde itself with the object of avoiding undesirable side reactions. In addition to the alkanoic acid or derivatives thereof and the formaldehyde or methylal, the reaction mixture can contain an alcohol as either a reactant or diluent. Thus, it is shown in UK Patent No. 1,491,183 and in US Patent No. 4,147,718 that methacrylic acid esters may be prepared by reacting methylal with either a propionic acid ester or a mixture of propionic acid and an alcohol. The use of alcohols, especially lower alkanols, as diluents is described in UK Patent No. 1,428,277 which relates to the production of a, s unsaturated acids or esters by reacting an appropriate saturated acid or ester with formaldehyde in the presence of water and a catalyst comprising an alkali metal compound dispersed on a solid carrier. When the starting material is an alkyl carboxylate, the alkanol diluent is said to allow a lower feed molar ratio of alkyl carboxylate to formaldehyde and to inhibit hydrolysis of the feed and product esters. The alkanol diluent remains unchanged at the end of the process and is easily recovered and recycled.The preferred catalyst supports are silica gels and silicas and theExamples describe the preparation of methyl methacrylate and similar esters using potassium hydroxide on silica gel and a methanol formaldehyde molar ratio of up to 7.5. Thus, using either formaldehyde or methylal as reactant, it is known to include an alcohol, especially methanol, the reaction mixture as a solvent, as a diluent or for the in situ conversion of carboxylic acids to esters. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that, provided an alumina based catalyst is used, the formaldehyde or methylal can be entirely replaced by methanol. Since formaldehyde and methylal are manufactured by the oxidation of methanol, it is clearly advantageous to proceed direct from the latter. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for the preparation of a compound of the formula R X Y wherein R represents hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical X represents a divalent radical of the formula EMI3.1 and Y represents CN or COOR1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen or an alkyl radical, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula R CH2 Y wherein R and Y have the above meanings, with methanol at an elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst comprising alumina and in the substantial absence of formaldehyde or a derivative thereof. The expression in the substantial absence of formaldehyde or a derivative thereof means that suitable feed mixtures for use in the reaction contain less than 0.05 mole of formaldehyde, or a derivative thereof such as methylal, per mole of methanol. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the feed mixture contains no significant amounts of formaldehyde or derivatives thereof and the method comprises contacting a mixture consisting essentially of methanol and a compound of the formula R X Y as hereinbefore defined, with a catalyst comprising alumina at an elevated temperature. Hydrocarbyl radicals which may be represented byR in the starting material and product include alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl radicals. Suitable cycloalkyl and aryl radicals include cyclohexyl and phenyl radicals respectively. Suitable alkyl radicals contain up to 8 carbon atoms. When the starting material and product are esters, alkyl radicals which may be represented by R1 include radicals containing up to 8 carbon atoms. The invention provides a method of making a, ss unsaturated carboxylic acids, esters and nitriles and or the corresponding saturated compounds. The ratio of unsaturated to saturated materials in the reaction product depends upon the particular catalyst employed and upon the other reaction conditions. The unsaturated compounds are usually more valuable than the saturated compounds and the conditions are usually selected so as to optimise production of the unsaturated materials.The method of the invention is particularly useful for preparation of acrylic and methacrylic acids and their ester and nitrile derivatives starting from acetic and propionic acids and their appropriate derivatives. In particular, the invention provides an extremely convenient method of making methyl methacrylate in high selectivity, direct from methanol and methyl propionate. The catalyst may contain alumina in substantially pure form or in admixture or combination with other materials. Thus, the catalyst may contain alumina, aluminates, amorphous aluminosilicates, zeolites, clays or aluminium phosphates. The preferred catalysts are those in which the alumina, in free or combined form, has been treated with a basic material, for example an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide. Accordingly, particularly suitable catalysts include alkali metal aluminates as well as amorphous or crystalline aluminosilicates in their alkali metal or alkaline earth metal forms. Suitable materials may be prepared by known impregnation or ion exchange techniques followed, if desired, by calcination. The use of the alumina based catalysts in an alkaline form is particularly useful for avoiding the production of acids in ester preparations. For improved activity and improved selectivity towards a, unsaturated products, the catalyst may also contain heavy metals, for example copper, silver, iron or zinc. Such metals may be incorporated by known impregnation or ionexchange techniques. The catalysts may be calcined at temperatures of up to 700 C although no particular advantage is gained by carrying out the calcination above 500 C. The catalyst may be employed in a fixed, moving or fluidised bed. The method of the invention is suitably performed at temperatures in the range 200 to 5000C, preferably 300 to 400 C. Atmospheric pressure is preferred although elevated pressures up to 50 bar may be employed if desired. The mole ratio of methanol to acid, ester or nitrile is suitably within the range 0.04 1 to 25 1, preferably 0.1 1 to 10 1 and more especially 0.5 1 to 2 1. Preferably, the reaction is carried out without added solvents and in particular without added water. The method of the invention may be performed as a batch or continuous process. Preferably, a continuous process is employed, the unreacted starting materials being separated from the product using conventional techniques and recycled to the feed stock.
