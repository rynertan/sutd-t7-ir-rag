## Description
he object of this invention is to nrovide a canony and sunnort structure therefor of simnle and effective construction primarily for providing a sun canopy over the driving position on an agricultural tractor or for similar use on other vehicles or even on some kinds of water craft.A.particular object is to provide a canony and sunnort structure which virtually provides no hindrance to vision from the driving nosition and which can be readily removed when not required and folded or rolled un for stowage.According to this invention a canony and support structure therefor primarily for use on a tractor comprises a canopy of flexible sheet material such as canvas or similar material provided with onen ended tubular formation of the same or similar material at or adjacent its sides and which receive frame members there through forming a frame of rectangular or other suitable shape to maintain the canopy in its extended condition of use, the frame being mounted or mountable on uprights for sunnorting it and the canony from the tractor over the driving position or fe,1. similar nurnosesv A practical example of the invention as a sun canony for a tractor is shown in the accomnanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the canony mounted on a tractor, FIGURE 2 is an underside plan view showing the canopy and one form of the frame, FIGURE 3 is a plan view of the frame of FIGURE 2 ner se in the unassembled condition. FIGURE 4 is an underside plen view similar to FIGURE 2 but showing a mod ified construction of frame, FIGURE 5 is an enlarged scale detail view of a socket assembly, FIGURE S is a nersnective view of the rolled un canony and uprights as a package for transit or stowage. FIGURE 7 is a side elevation of a developed form of upright, and FIGURES 8 and 9 are restectively an underside clan view and detail view similar to FIGURES 4 and 5 but showing further modification.Like parts are referred to by the same or similar reference numerals throughout the drawings.Referring to FIGURES 1 to 3 the canony 1 itself is made of heavy duty canvas or other suitable sheet material such as nylon reinforced tolyproty ene and consists of a ton panel 10 which is boxed to provide front, side and rear skits 11, 12, 13 of which the rear skirt 13 can be of greater depth than the front skirt 11 with the side skirts 12 tapered accordingly as shown in FIGURE 1.The underside of the top panel 10 is provided with open ended tubular formations or channels 14, 15 and 16 of similar material sewn or otherwise secured to it adjacent the skirts 11, 12, 13 and receiving the canony frame members 4, 5 and 6 shown of round section or other suitable tubing.In the example shown the forward frame member 4 of the frame 2 FIGURES 2 and 3 is permanently retained in the corresnonding canvas channel 14 and is erovided with short right angle end portions 41 providing sockets 42 for receiving reduced end portions 51 of corresnonding side frame members 5 slidably inserted in respective canvas side channels 15.The other ends of the side members 5 have a similar projection and socket engagement at 52 with right angle corner nieces 6 which in turn have a socket engagement at 62 with the rear frame member assembly F.The rear frame member assembly f is in two parts C , 6 slidable in respective canvas channels IC and having a socket engagement 3 at a mid sart or thereabouts so that the assembly Ã‡ can be retracted for disengagement from the end pieces CC or extended into engagement with the latter and retained in the extended condition by a bolt 64 passing through a transverse hole 640, more than one of such holes being provided in each member for adjustment purposes.For the various socket engagements at 42, 52, 62 and 63 the ends of the side and rear frame members 5, 6 receive smaller diameter inserts of tube or round section bar.Each rear corner piece 66 is welded or otherwise fast with the upper curved or bent end 70 of a corresponding upright 7 the lower end of which is provided with a bracket 71 or otherwise adapted to be secured to appropriate structure of the tractor 3 such as to the rear axle casing 30 of the latter.With the frame 2 in the assembled and locked condition in the canopy 1 so as to maintain the latter in the extended condition, the canopy can be quickly mounted on the tractor 3 and in view of the fact that only two rearwardly situated uprights 7 are employed, virtually unrestricted all round vision is afforded from the driving position as will be evident from FIGURE 1.When the canopy 1 is not required for use, the uprights 7 are detached from the tractor 3 after which on laying the canopy 1 upside down on the ground or other surface, the bolt 64 can be withdrawn to enable the rear frame member assembly 6 , 6 to be retracted in a telescopic manner out of engagement with the corner pieces 66.The side frame members 5 can then be withdrawn from their canvas channels 15 and out of socket engagement with the ends 41 of the forward member 4 prior to or after dis engagement from the corner pieces 66 thus leaving only the forward cross member 4 and rear cross member assembly 6 retained on the canopy 1. It is then possible to roll up the canopy 1 at the same time including the side members 5 placed across the canopy parallel with the front and rear cross members 4, 6, 6 1for inclusion in the rolled up canopy. The uprights 7 can be similarly included if so desired or the rolled up canopy 1 with frame members thereiX and uprights 7 can be packaged for transit or stowage in the manner shown in FIGURE 6. For adequate strength the frame members 4, 5 and 6 or more particularly the uprights 7 may consist of lined tubing, i.e.outer tubing having an inner reinforcement of smaller diameter tubing. This enables uprights 7 of adequate strength to be provided for supporting the canopy 1 having regard to the shocks imparted to it as the tractor travels over rough terrain.The uprights 7 are shown of square section tube.referring to FIGURES 4 and 5 an alternative construction of frame 20 is shown in which the forward cross member 40 has right angled end portions 410 received by sleeves 45 which also receive the forward end portions of corresponding side frame members 50. The sleeves 45 are retained in the connecting position by transverse bolts 46 passing through them and the end portions 410 and or if desired through the forward end portions of the side members 50 so that by removal of the bolts 46 the sleeves 45 can be slid back out of engagement with the end portions 410 or from the side members 50. The rear end portions of the side members 50 have a socket engagement 620 with right angled end portions 660 of the rear frame member 60. In the assembled condition of the frame shown in FIGURE 4 this socket engagement 620 is retained by a tie bar 8 bolted or otherwise detachably connected at respective ends to the forward and rear frame members 40, 60 which tie bar 8 is disconnected when it is required to dismantle the frame 20. The tie bar 8 is preferably bowed or arched upwardly as indicated at 80 in order to raise the centre part of the top panel 10 of the canopy 1 for rain water drainage.The socket engagement 620 is shown consisti ng of a multiple co axially inter fitting tubular assembly for adequate strength in supporting the frame 20 from the uprights 7.Thus as shown in FIGURE 5 the forwardly extending limb of each right angled end portion 660 of the rear frame member 60 has welded or otherwise secured co axially about it a length of tube 68 which abuts at 65 the rear end of the corresponding tubular side member 50 within an outer sleeve 67. The side member 50 also has a length of co axial tube 55 welded about it and which abuts at 56 the forward end of the outer sleeve 67 which is welded onto the bent runner end 70 of a corresponding upright 7 see FIGURES 4 and 6 . Finally a collar 69 welded about the tube r abuts at 96 the rear end of the sleeve C7 The sleeves 67 may be of greater wall thickness than the tubes 55, 68After the tie bar 8 has been disconnected the socket assembly 620 can be readily taken a art to dis connect the side members 50 from the rear member ro and the unrights 7 from both of the latter whilst the interfitting co axial engagement of the members 660, 68, 50, 55 within or in relation to the sleeves 67 provides high strength connection of the uprights 7 to the frame 20.In order to further support the uprights 7 they are shorn bolted to the rear wheel fenders 31 FIGURE 1 of the tractor 3 by means of plates 72 welded on the uprights 7, packing pieces or plates being provided as necessary to take un any clearance between each unright 7 and the adjacent fender 31. The attachment in this way is further strengthened by 8 cross bar 9 bolted by lugged ends to the slates 72 and which also se.rves to reinforce support of the fenders 31.In the package form of the rolled un canony 1 and unrights 7 shown in FIGURE C the mounting brackets 71 of the uprights are bolted together and the sleeves 67 ho d together by a length of tube or rod 77 inserted through them and which may receive end cans 770. The tube 77 and end cans 770 e.g. of elastic material are for transit and stowage purposeS only and form no part of the assembled canony and sunnort structure. Where the uprights 7 carry corner pieces 66 as in FIGURES 2 and 3, the tube 77 is inserted in the ends of onnosed corner niece limbs in a similar manner.Referring to FIGURE 7 a developed form of upright 7 is shown and which is nrovided with a narallel reinforcement member 75 welded at 750 to the main member 7 i.e. to the under end 70 of the latter and to a lower part at 751 intermediate the fender bracket 7 and lower bracket 71.The fender bracket 72 is also shown welded to the reinforcement member 75.Uprights according to FIGURE 7 are shown in FIGURE 8 where the construction of the frame 20 is generally similar to that shown in FIGURE 4. However the canopy 1 is provided with somewhat wider open ended channels or nockets 14, 15, 16 for freedom of movement of the frame members 40, 50, 60 in assembling the frame 20 to extrnd the canopy 1 or in taking the frame a art prior to rolling up the canony. Multiple interfitting co axial tubular assembly of the frame 20 where it passes through the upright sockets 67 is shown in FIGURE 9 where each side member 50 is provided with an outer sleeve 55 which in this case enters within an internal liner sleeve 670 of the associated socket h7, a collar 57 about the sleeve 55 abutting the forward end nart of the liner sleeve 670 adjacent welding of the latter to the socket 67. h forward end of the corner portion 660 of the rear frame member rO is received over the rear end nart of the side member 50 and abuts the rear end of the outer sleeve 55 at 665. A collar 667 about the corner portion 660 also abuts the rear end of the liner sleeve 70. As before the frame 0 is retained in the assembled condition by the tie bar 8.
