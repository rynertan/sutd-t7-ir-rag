## Description
The field of art to which the claimed invention pertains is the removal of sulfur oxide from a gas, particularly an FCC flue gas. There are a number of continuous cyclical processes em ploying fluidized solid techniques in which carbonaceous materials are deposited on the solids in the reaction zone and the solids are conveyed during the course of the cycle to another zone where carbon deposits are at least partially removed by combustion in an oxygen containing medium. The solids from the latter zone are subsequently withdrawn and reintroduced in whole or in part to the reaction zone. One of the more important processes of this nature is the fluid catalytic cracking FCC process for the conversion of rela tively high boiling hydrocarbons to lighter hydrocarbons boiling in the heating oil or gasoline or lighter range. The hydrocarbon feed is contacted in one or more reaction zones with the particulate cracking catalyst maintained in a fluidized state under conditions suitable for the conversion of hydrocarbons. Due to the ever increasing concern about air pollution, great efforts have been expended in recent years toward the develop ment of processes to reduce the pollutants introduced into the atmo sphere from various industrial operations. One of the most onerous of these pollutants is sulfur dioxide which is present in the stacks of flue gases from various operations. In one such opera tion, the fluidized catalytic cracking FCC process, sulfur com pounds contained in the hydrocarbon feedstock result in sulfur con taining material to be deposited on the FCC catalyst along with the carbonaceous material and thereby cause the generation of sulfur dioxide in the FCC regeneration section when the sulfur is burned off the catalyst along with the carbon deposits. This sulfur di oxide becomes a part of the regenerator flue gas and thus a pollu tant when the flue gas eventually finds its way into the atmosphere. There are many methods known to the art for removal of sulfur dioxide from stack or flue gases. There is, for example, the wet scrubbing process in which the sulfur dioxide reacts with an ap propriate reactant contained in an aqueous solution or slurry sprayed into the flue gas, the sulfur thereby being removed from the system as a compound contained in the liquid phase. In another process the flue gas is passed through a fixed solid bed containing a sulfur acceptor with which the sulfur dioxide reacts and on which the sul fur is retained in the sulfate form, thereby being removed from the flue gas. A prior art process for removal of sulfur dioxide from FCC flue gas highly pertinent to the present invention is that dis closed in U.S. Patent 4,071,436 to Blanton, Jr., et al. In this process alumina particles are in admixture with the FCC catalyst and are circulated therewith throughout the reactor regenerator circuit. In the regenerator the alumina reacts with sulfur dioxide to form a solid compound, which when circulated to the reactor reacts with hydrocarbons in the feedstock in the reducing environment to release the sulfur, supposedly as hydrogen sulfide. The sulfur is thereby dealt with in the FCC facilities downstream of the reactor section instead of as part of the regenerator flue gas. This reference states that it is preferred that materials such as calcium not be present in the particulate solid used for removal of the sulfur dioxide, since they simply form a noncyclical sulfur containing solid. U.S. Patent 4,146,463 to Radford et al. discloses very broadly sulfur oxide acceptors which might be incorporated with FCC catalyst or circulated as separate particles. Among the many possibilities, this reference teaches calcium deposited on alumina as a sulfur oxide acceptor. There is no recognition in this ref erence, however, of the criticality of the amount and nature of such deposition. Specifically, with regard to Group IIA metals, this reference teaches very broad ranges for the amount of metal oxides which may be deposited, i.e., 25 ppm 7 as the broadest preferred range with 0.1 0.5 as the most preferred. There is no hint in this reference to the desirability of a single complete monolayer of the deposited metal oxide on the support. U.S. Patent 4,325,811 to Sorrentino teaches the use of a separate reduction zone in a process such as that in Radford et al. in which the absorbed sulfur oxides are released from the acceptor particles. The process conditions in the reducing zone can be independently adjusted so as to optimize the removal of the sulfur oxides. It is also known in the art that an FCC catalyst con taminated with metals such as nickel or iron from the hydrocarbon feedstock may be very effectively passivated by contacting the catalyst with a light hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen mixture at passivation reaction conditions prior to recycling the catalyst to the reactor. The passivation reaction involves the contaminating metals and serves to minimize their undesirable catalytic activity in the reaction zone. The passivation reaction is preferably car ried out in a passivation reaction zone comprising a vessel in the dipleg line between the regeneration vessel and the reactor riser. The present invention is based on the discovery of the surprising effectiveness of a sulfur oxide acceptor comprising a single complete monolayer of calcium oxide deposited on an aluminum oxide or aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide support. In brief summary, the present invention is a process for removing sulfur oxides from a gas which comprises contacting the gas with an acceptor at acceptance conditions which reacts with and retains the sulfur oxides. The acceptor comprises calcium oxide deposited on an aluminum oxide or magnesium oxide and aluminum oxide support so as to provide essentially a single complete monolayer of calcium on the support. The retained sulfur oxides are removed from the acceptor by contacting the acceptor with a reducing gas comprising hydrogen at reduction conditions. Other embodiments of the invention encompass details about acceptor composition, flow schemes and reaction conditions, all of which are hereinafter disclosed in the following discussion of each of the facets of the invention. I have made the surprising and unexpected discovery, with regard to the performance of a sulfur oxide acceptor comprising calcium oxide deposited on an aluminum oxide or aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide support, of the criticality of having a single com plete monolayer of the calcium oxide on the support. I have found that when the monolayer is less than complete, reduction of the sulfur containing acceptor with hydrogen will produce less of the desirable hydrogen sulfide gas as opposed to the much less desirable free sulfur or sulfur dioxide. On the other hand, if the calcium oxide is deposited in excess of a single monolayer, the acceptance ability of the acceptor will be diminished. It is important to avoid the production of free sulfur or sulfur dioxide in the course of reducing or regenerating acceptors. Free sulfur would have the tendency to plug the process equipment and the production of sulfur dioxide would, of course, defeat the purpose of the sulfur oxide removal from the gas. The high purity hydrogen sulfide obtained by the process of the present invention may be disposed of in many ways, including direct sale as a valuable industrial chemical. The degree to which a calcium oxide monolayer on the support is achieved may be quantitized by the expression ϑ The deposition of the calcium oxide on the support to achieve the above result is best effected by the well known evap orative impregnating technique. In that technique the support is immersed in an appropriate amount and concentration of an aqueous solution of a calcium salt and the water is removed by evaporation. A rotary steam jacketed evaporator is ideal for that purpose. The impregnated support may than be removed from the evaporator, further dried and finally calcined so as to convert the calcium to its oxide form. The composition of the support material may comprise alumina Al₂O₃ or alumina and magnesia MgO . These oxides or mixtures thereof are most conveniently prepared by the gelation of sol precursors followed by drying and calcining. If the support comprises the oxide mixture, the weight ratio of magnesium oxide to aluminum oxide should be from about 0.15 1.0 to about 0.50 1.0. Without being limited to any particular theory, my hypothesis as to why it is critical not to impregnate more than one monolayer of calcium compound is as set forth in the following reaction scheme where chemical equations are presented to represent the reactions which are hypothesized to occur in both the situations where one monolayer is not exceeded, and the situation where it is exceeded. It is believed in this scheme that the CaO in excess of a monolayer forms a segregated CaO phase, i.e., there is no inter action between the CaO and the aluminum in the support. CaO forms CaSO₄ upon reacting with SO₂ eq. 2 . CaSO₄ is then reduced to CaS eq. 6 which is too stable to be hydrolyzed to CaO H₂S, as shown by the equilibrium to the left eq. 7 . Thus most of the sulfur uptaken from the first acceptance remains on the acceptor as CaS. CaS is reoxidized into CaSO₄ eq. 8 and partially decom posed into CaO and SO₂ eq. 9 . The SO₂ evolved from the decom position of CaSO₄ plus the SO₂ present in the gas feed may surpass the acceptor acceptance ability and consequently some of the SO₂ may break through the acceptor bed. This explains the observation that there is always a small amount of SO₂ that escapes from the acceptor in the second and following acceptance cycles and the amounts of SO₂ which escapes is significantly higher for acceptors with ϑca greater than 1.0. The aluminum which apparently plays an important role with the acceptor used in the process of the present invention eqs. 1, 3, 4 and 5 , is simply not available when ϑca is greater than 1.0. The process of the present invention would be particularly useful for treating the flue gas from a fluid catalytic cracking unit FCC regenerator. It is not unusual for such flue gas to be high in sulfur oxide content due to the high sulfur content frequent ly found in low quality, high sulfur FCC feedstocks, the use of which is becoming increasingly common. Associating the process of the present invention with the FCC process would have the further ad vantage that a source of reducing hydrogen would be readily avail able since hydrogen is one of the FCC reaction products and could be supplied from the standard FCC gas concentration or treatment facili ties in a quantity and purity quite adequate for use in the process of the present invention. Such hydrogen would be supplied as a mixture of light hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen. Charge stocks used in the catalytic cracking process also commonly contain contaminant metals such as nickel, iron, cobalt and vanadium found in the charge stock which usually influence the regeneration operation, catalyst selectivity, catalyst activity and the fresh catalyst makeup rate required to maintain a constant activity. Metals contained in the feed are deposited on the cata lyst and not only change its selectivity in the direction of less gasoline and more coke and light gas in a given reactor system but tend to deactivate the catalyst. Beneficial effects of this inven tion are also realized in passivating these metals for FCC units processing heavy or residual charge stocks, i.e., those boiling above 482 C, which frequently have a high metals content. In a typical FCC process flow, finely divided regenerated catalyst leaves the regeneration zone at a certain temperature and contacts a feedstock in a lower portion of a reactor riser zone. While the resulting mixture, which has a temperature of from about 200 C to about 700 C, passes up through the riser, conversion of the feed to lighter products occurs and coke is deposited on the catalyst. The effluent from the riser is discharged into a dis engaging space where additional conversion can take place. The hydrocarbon vapors, containing entrained catalyst, are then passed through one or more cyclone separation means to separate any spent catalyst from the hydrocarbon vapor stream. The separate hydro carbon vapor stream is passed into a fractionation zone known in the art as the main column wherein the hydrocarbon effluent is separated into such typical fractions as light gases and gasoline, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and slurry oil. Various fractions from the main column can be recycled along with the feedstock to the reactor riser. Typically, fractions such as light gases and gasoline are further separated and processed in a gas concentration process located downstream of the main column. Some of the fractions from the main column, as well as those recovered from the gas con centration process may be recovered as final product streams. The separated spent catalyst passes into the lower portion of the dis engaging space and eventually leaves that zone passing through stripping means in which a stripping gas, usually steam, contacts the spent catalyst purging adsorbed and interstitial hydrocarbons from the catalyst. The spent catalyst containing coke leaves the stripping zone and passes into a regeneration zone, where, in the presence of fresh regeneration gas and at a temperature of from about 540 C to about 760 C, a combustion of coke produces regen erated catalyst and flue gas containing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen and perhaps a small quantity of oxygen. Usually, the fresh regeneration gas is air, but it could be air enriched or deficient in oxygen. Flue gas is separated from en trained regenerated catalyst by cyclone separation means located within the regeneration zone and separated flue gas is passed from the regeneration zone, typically, to a carbon monoxide boiler where the chemical heat of carbon monoxide is recovered by combustion as a fuel for the production of steam, or, if carbon monoxide com bustion in the regeneration zone is complete, which is the pre ferred mode of operation, the flue gas passes directly to sensible heat recovery means and from there to a refinery stack. Regenerated catalyst which was separated from the flue gas is returned to the lower portion of the regeneration zone which typically is main tained at a higher catalyst density. A stream of regenerated cata lyst leaves the regeneration zone, and, as previously mentioned, contacts the feedstock in the reaction zone. The sulfur problem in the FCC process is concerned pri marily with the carry over of sulfur moieties into the regenerator with the coked catalyst resulting in increased emissions of sulfur oxide with the flue gas. In recent years several concepts have been proposed for reducing sulfur oxide emission from the catalyst regenerator. The most viable concept is as that disclosed as afore mentioned in U.S. Patent 4,071,436 to Blanton, Jr., et al. which involves the addition of sulfur oxide acceptors to the catalyst wherein the acceptor species is converted to a sulfate in the regenerator environment and subsequently converted back to an oxide form in the reactor riser with the concomitant release of sulfur in the form of hydrogen sulfide. This procedure is claimed to be rea sonably effective and practical. The separate reducing zone as taught in U.S. Patent 4,325,811 to Sorrentino adds further flexi bility and effectiveness to the process. In the preferred FCC embodiment of the present invention, particles of the acceptor are physically admixed with the FCC cata lyst and react with sulfur oxides in the regenerator to form the spent sulfur containing acceptor. The spent acceptor is freed from the sulfur and renewed by withdrawing the acceptor and catalyst from the regeneration zone and treating the acceptor in the acceptor renewal zone by contacting it with a reducing gas comprising hydro gen at reducing condition, whereby the sulfur becomes dissociated from the acceptor, and then recirculating the catalyst and acceptor to the cracking zone. The preferred acceptance conditions of the process of the present invention would comprise a temperature from about 540 C to about 760 C which would encompass typical FCC regen erator operating temperatures. The reduction temperature which could easily be maintained in an acceptor renewal zone, would preferably be at least about 730 C. The renewal zone would most conveniently comprise a vessel in the dipleg line between the regeneration vessel and the reactor riser. The following nonlimiting example is presented to illus trate the capability of the process of the present invention to achieve acceptance of SO₂ from a gas, to release the retained sulfur in the course of reduction with hydrogen in the desirable form of H₂S and the criticality of ϑca being equal to about 1.0 essentially a single complete monolayer of calcium oxide being on the support . A series of sulfur oxide acceptors was prepared, includ ing acceptors having the composition required by the present inven tion and acceptors not having such composition. In all cases the salt of the added metal, i.e., calcium in most cases, was deposited on the alumina or alumina and magnesia support by impregnation. The supports were obtained by the gelling or co gelling of alumina or alumina magnesia sols, followed by drying and calcining the gels. The attached table summarizes the compositions of the above acceptors as well as their performance when used to remove sulfur dioxide from a typical flue gas at 730 C followed by reduction with hydrogen at 730 C. In interpreting the results shown in the table in quali tative terms, it is clear that H₂S selectivity increases dramatically while the acceptance decreases slightly up to a value for ϑca of about 1.0. It is equally important to note that for values of ϑca above 1.0 greater than one monolayer , there is a tendency for the sulfur retained on the spent acceptor to increase to an unac ceptable degree, i.e., high sulfur retention means low acceptance of SO₂ in subsequent cycles. In fact, further runs were conducted not shown in the table with low surface area α alumina 0.1m² g impregnated with 2.0 wt. Ca, resulting in a ϑca of about 300, where it was observed that after two cycles of acceptance and reduction, the result was near zero SO₂ acceptance in the third cycle. Finally tests were run with acceptors comprising BaO on Catapal alumina, BeO on Catapal alumina, and MgO impregnated alumina, in each case with enough oxide to form one monolayer. With the BaO acceptor the acceptance was 100 for up to only two cycles, but with rapid falling off of acceptance in subsequent cycles due to retention of the sulfur. With the BeO acceptor the acceptance of 89.7 was observed, but there appeared to be a very high selectivity for SO₂ during reduction. The MgO impregnated Al₂O₃ showed a very low 75.8 acceptance and 36.2 H₂S selectivity. The above discussed data clearly leads one to the conclu sion that only an acceptor comprising calcium oxide deposited as a single complete monolayer on an alumina or alumina magnesia support will provide high acceptance as well as high selectivity for H₂S over an extended number of cycles.
