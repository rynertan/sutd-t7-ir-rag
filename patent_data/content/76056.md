# Apparatus and method for manufacturing helical cores.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for manufacturing helically wound coils using a rotating ring of pins to pull a prepun ched continuous strip of material between two components which operate cooperatively to deform the strip by thinning one of its edges. A braking means provides tension on the strip through its deformation and a dereeler provides a continuous supply of straight, prepunched strip material.
