## Description
This invention relates to recombinant DNA techniques for the production of relaxin more particularly, it relates to synthetic genes for relaxin and to the expressidn thereof, to corresponding plasmid recombinants and transformed cells and to the production thereof. Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone which IS produced in the ovaries and certain other tissues, especially during pregnancy. Although synthesised and stored in the ovaries, serum immunoreactive relaxin rises, often dramatically, towards the end of pregnancy in pigs, rats, guinea pigs, mice and hamsters. Relaxin is known to have effects on the pubic symphysis, uterus, mammary glands and connective tissue, it causes cervical ripening and initiates parturition, see, for example, Steinetz, B.c,, et al,A98O, Dilatation of the Uterine Cervix, Eds. Naftolin, F., and Stubblefield, P.G., Raven Press,New York, 157 177 and Schwabe, C., et al, 1980 , RecentProgress In Hormone Research, Relaxin, 34, 123 199 . Relaxin shows remarkable cross species reactivity both in in vivo and in vitro tests and in its antigenicity to such an extent that porcine relaxin has been used in a clinical trial on patients requiring surgical induction of labours see, for example, Steinetz, B.G., et al, loc cit Schwabe, C., et al, loc cit O Byrne, E.., and Steinetz,B.G., 1976 , Prow. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 152, 272 276 andLarkin, L.H., et al, 1979 , Acta Endocrinologica, 92, 568 576 . After administration of relaxin, most patients had improved cervical scores and significantly fewer required augmentation in labour with oxytocin than the control group, no side effects were shown, see, for example, MacLennan, AH., et al, 1980 , The Lancet, 2 February, 220 223 .Porcine relaxin is therefore considered to be useful in the induction and control of labour. Administration of porcine relaxin to sows during farrowing may also be of use in reducing the rate of still birth of piglets. It has been observed that, especially with large litters, mortality tends to occur with the last of the litter, see, for example,Asdell, S.A., and Willman, J.P. 1941 , J. Ag. Res., 63, 345 353 when the level of relaxin may decline. Relaxin is one of a number of insulin like polypeptides and comprises two polypeptide chains, A andB, connected by disulphide bridges, see, for example,Schwabe, C., and McDonald, J.R., 1977 , Science, 197, 914 915 Bedarkar, S. , et al, 1977 , Nature, 270, 449451 and Isaacs, N., et al, 1978 , Nature, 271, 278 281 .The porcine A chain comprises 22 amino acids as illustrated in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. Apparently, some microheterogeneity exists in that a proportion of relaxin has been found to have an A chain wherein from lp to 20 of the glutamine at position 10 is replaced by glutamic acid, see, for example, Niall, H.D., et al, 1980 , Insulin chemistry, structure and function of insulin and related hormones, Eds. Brandenburg, D., andWollmer, A., Walter de Gruyter, New York, 719 726 . The porcine B chain comprises from 28 to 31 amino acids as illustrated in Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings wherein PGA represents pyroglutamic acid. The carboxy terminus of the B chain appears to be heterogeneous, which is indicated in the drawing by vertical lines.As usually isolated, the major components of peaks termed CM a used in the clinical trial and CM a have B chains of 29 and 31 residues respectively, see, for example,Niall, H.D., et al, loc cit . Another reported B chain structure comprises 26 residues and corresponds to the above mentioned structure, except that residues 24 to 26 are Val Trp Ser, see, for example, Schwabe, C., et al, 1977 , Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 75, 503 510 . Also, a B chain structure comprising 30 residues has been reported which is similar, except that residues 27 to 30 are Thr Trp Gly Arg, see, for example, Kwok, S., andBryant Greenwood, G., 1977 , Nature, 267, 544 546 . On the basis of the known amino acid sequences illustrated in accompanying Figures 1 and 2, novel synthetic gene sequences have been determined corresponding to the A chain and the B chain separately and to a hybridB C A gene wherein the C sequence codes for a peptide link between the B and A chains. It was decided to base the linking C sequence on the peptide Asp Pro , which is known to be sensitive to hydrolysis at about pH 2, see, for example, London, M., 1977 , Methods in Enzymology 47, 145 . The actual sequence chosen for the peptide was Asp Pro Gly Asp Pro see Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings , which allows the A and B chains to assume the normal conformation without distortion. The hybridB C A is produced as a single peptide, which may be used without modification or may be cleaved at low pH to remove the C peptide. In the selection of an optimum sequence from the large number of codon possibilities, arising from the degeneracy of the genetic code, several criteria have been observed. Firstly, trinucleotide codons should be used which are most acceptable to the cells in which the gene will be expressed, in particularE. coli, see, for example, Grantham, R., et al, 1980 , Nucl. Acids.Res., 8, r47 r62 . Secondly, the 5 terminus of the gene should have a restriction site, such as anEcoRI site, such that, when the sticky end is treated with S1 nuclease, the blunt end produced will be exactly at the 5 end of the coding sequence. Thirdly, the 3 end should have a chain terminator codon. Fourthly, the 3 end should have a restriction site, such as a Hind III site, for use for insertion into an appropriate plasmid.Fifthly, the restriction sites at the 5 and 3 ends should enable the gene to be cloned into and excised from a suitable plasmid, such as pBR 322 see, for example,Bolivar, F., et al, 1977 , Gene, 2, 95 113 . Sixthly, sequences within the gene which are self complementary or are complementary to the other sequences other than the correct sequence on either strand or the doublestranded gene should be kept to a minimum. Using a computer, energies arising from all possible interactions were calculated, see, for example,Tinoco, Jr., I., et al, 1971 , Nature, 230, 362 367 and Powers, G.J., et al, 1975 , JACS, 97, 875 889 , so that off diagonal interactions might be avoided as far as possible. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a synthetic gene for the expression of the porcine relaxin A chain which comprises the following sequence 5 CGC ATG ACT CTG TCC 3 GCG TAC TGA GAC AGG GAG AAA TGT TGq CAG CTC TTT ACA ACG GTC GTT GGT TGT ATC CGT CAA CCA ACA TAG GCA AAA GAC ATT GCT CGT TTT CTG TAA CGA GCA CTG TGT 3 GAC ACA 5 In a further embodiment of the present invention, the A gene contains, in addition to the coding sequence, a stop codon, restriction sites forEcoRI and Hind.III in order to facilitate insertion into plasmids, such as pAT 153, see, for example, Twigg, A.J., and Sherratt, D., 1980 , Nature, 283, 216 218 , or expression plasmids, in particular pWT 571, see, for example, published European Patent Application No. 52002 , a Hinf I restriction site which enables a gene lacking codons for Arg and Met to be cloned the product for such a gene lacking Arg and with or without the terminal initiator methionine introduced from the expression plasmid may be more active than the original gene containing the Arg residue with or without an initiator methionine and an EcoR2 restriction site, see Figure 4 of the accompanying drawings . In this embodiment, the present invention relates to a synthetic gene for the expression of the porcine relaxin A chain which comprises the following sequence 5 A ATT CCC ATG ACT CTG TCC 3 GCG TAC TGA GAC AGG GAG AAA TGT TGC CAG CTC TTT ACA ACG GTC GTT GGT TGT ATC CGT CAA CCA ACA TAG GCA AAA GAC ATT GCT CGT TTT CTG TAA CGA GCA CTG TGT TA 3 GAC ACA ATT CGA 5 In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a synthetic gene for the expression of the porcine relaxin B chain which comprises the following sequence 5 CAG TCG ACC AAC GAT TTC ATC 3 GTC AGC TGG TTG CTA AAG TAG AAA GCT TGT GGA CGT GAG TTA TTT CGA ACA CCT GCA CTC AAT GTT CGT TTA TGG GTT GAG ATC CAA GCA AAT ACC CAA CTC TAG TGT GGC TCT GTA AGT TGG GGT ACA CCG AGA CAT TCA ACC CCA CGT ACC GCA 3 GCA TGG CGT 5 In a further embodiment of the present invention, the B gene contains, in addition to the coding sequence, a stop codon, an initiator methionine codon, restriction sites for Cla I and Bam HI in order to facilitate insertion into plasmids, such as pAT 153, and restriction sites for Sal I, Hind III, .Bgl II and Rsa I, see Figure 5 of the accompanying drawings . There are three alternative forms, each with a different 3 terminal region to code forthe different C termini of the B chains. In this embodiment, the present invention relates to a synthetic gene for the expression of the porcine relaxin B chain which comprises the following sequence 5 CGATG CAG TCC ACC AAC GAT TTC 3 TAC GTC AGC TGG TTG CTA AAG ATC AAA GCT TGT GGA CGT GAG TAG TTT CGA ACA CCT GCA CTC TTA GTT CGT TTA TGG GTT GAG AAT CAA GCA AAT ACC CAA CTC ATC TGT GGC TCT GTA AGT TGG TAG ACA CCG AGA CAT TCA ACC GGT CGT ACC GCA TAA G 3 CCA GCA TGG CGT ATT CCTAG 5 In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a synthetic gene for the expression of a porcine relaxin hybrid having a peptide link Asp Pro Gly Asp Pro between the B chain and the A chain which comprises the following sequence 5 GAT CCC GGG GAT CCG 3 3 CTA GGG CCC CTA GGC 5 . The hybrid B C A gene, which contains only a part of the B gene from the Bgl II site, has restriction sites for Bgl II and Bam HI in order to facilitate insertion into a plasmid, for example, pWT 551, see, for example, published European Patent Application No. 52002 , containing the other part of the B gene, internal restriction sites for Rsa I, Bam HI, Xma I, Hinf I and EcoR2 and a stop codon, see, for example, Figure 6 of the accompanying drawings wherein, for convenience, only the form for the longest B chain is illustrated . The genes were constructed by synthesising a number of oligonucleotide blocks. The synthetic blocks selected are illustrated in Figures 7, 8 and 9 of the accompanying drawings. The blocks may be constructed using known synthesis techniques, see, for example, Ito, et al, .1982 , Nucl. Acids Rev., 0, 1755 1769 . Once constructed, the oligomeric blocks of nucleotides were hybridised and ligated by known methods, see, for example, Agarwal, et al, 1970 , Nature, 227, 27 34 Accordingly, a further embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for the production of such a synthetic gene which comprises the assembly and ligation.of a number of oligonucleotide blocks. The next stage was to produce appropriate plasmid recombinants and hence to transform suitable cells so that the desired expression may be obtained. Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to a plasmid recombinant which comprises a plasmid vector having inserted therein at an insertion site such a synthetic gene, the plasmid vector reading in the correct phase for expression of the inserted gene and having a bacterial promoter upstream of and adjacent to the insertion site. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a process for the production of such a plasmid recombinant which comprises inserting such a synthetic gene into an appropriate plasmid vector. Also, another embodiment of the present invention relates to a cell which has been transformed by having inserted therein such a synthetic gene or such a plasmid recombinant. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a process for the production of such a cell which comprises inserting such a synthetic gene or such a plasmid recombinant into an appropriate cell. More particularly, the A gene was ligated into the large fragment of pWT 571 following removal of the small restriction fragment produced by treatment withEcoRI and Hind II and cloned. The plasmid was converted into one in which the relaxin A gene was next to the ATG codon for expression by treating with EcoRI and digesting the single stranded ends with S1 nuclease to form flush ends which were religated. The B gene was first cloned into pAT 153 at the Cla I and Ban HI sites for replication. For expression, the B gene was excised, flush ended at the CIa I end with S1 nuclease and inserted into the expression plasmid cut with Hind III and flush ended withSI nuclease. Partial digestion with S1 nuclease prior to ligation provides plasmids with slightly different ribosome binding sites. As an alternative, one method of cloning the B gene was to produce a synthetic B gene having a flush 5 end by making the oligomer CGATGCAGTC two bases shorter at the 5 end which was ligated intoHind III Bam HI digested pWT 551 with a flush endedHind III site. The hybrid B C A gene was cloned into pWT 551 already containing the expressing B gene following restriction with Bgl II and Bam HI. Following expression of the A and B genes after insertion into the above mentioned plasmids and cloning inE.coli, see, for example, Tacon, W.C.A., et al, 1980 ,Molec. Gen. Genet., 177, 427 , the A and B chains may be extracted and purified from the bacteria and recombined to form active relaxin by first converting the terminal glutamine of the B chain to pyroglutamic acid by treatment at 1000C then forming the disulphide bridges. See, for example, Katsoyannis, P.G., et al, 1967 , Biochemistry, 6, 2642 . Following the expression of the B C A gene, the peptide product may be cleaved by hydrolysis at low pH, see, for example, London, M., 1977 , loc cit . An alternative means of producing the B chain is as follows. The B gene may be ligated to the end of an expressing ss galactosidase gene and produced as a fused polypeptide with ss galactosidase. Cyanogen bromide cleavage at the methionine coded by the 5 end of the B gene releases a peptide identical to the B chain, see, for example, Casabadan, M.J., 1980 , J. Bact, 143, 971 and Goeddel, D.V., et al, 1979 , Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 76, 106 110 . Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for the production of at least one chain of porcine relaxin which comprises culturing such a cell. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a process for the production of porcine relaxin which comprises linking relaxin A and B chains produced by such a process via disulphide bridges. In a further embodiment, the present invention relates to a process for the production of porcine relaxin which comprises cleaving a porcine relaxin hybrid produced by such a process at low pH. The following illustrates the present invention Synthesis of the tridecanucleotide TpCpCpGpTpApApApGpApCpApT The completely protected tridecanucleotide wasbuilt up as illustrated in Figure 10 of the accompanying drawings wherein, for convenience, protecting groups are not shown. The reactions indicated by arrows in accompanyingFigure 10 were carried out by the following procedures. Commercially available, chloromethylated, 18 crosslinked polystyrene 0.32 meq Clog was converted to the amino methyl form i by known methods, see, for example, Mitchell, et al, 1976 , Tetrahedron Letters No.42, 3795 3798 . 5 dimethoxytrityl thymidine 3 Osuccinate was coupled to the polystyrene resin via an amide linkage by known methods, see, for example, Miyoshi, et al, 1980 , Nucl. Acids Res., 8, 5507 5517 . The preparation of dinucleotides was carried out by the following procedure exemplified in the synthesis ofEMI15.1 as illustrated in Figure 11 of the accompanying drawings. 3 mmoles ofEMI15.2 was reacted with 100 ml of 2 w v benzene sulphonic acid in dichloromethane methanol 7 3 v v for 5 minutes at 0 C. After extraction with 5 aqueous NalICO3 solution, the dichloromethane layer was dried and evaporated under vacuum to an oil. The product II was purified by chromatography on silica using a gradient elution of dichloromethane to 10 MeOH dichloromethane. 3.15 mmoles ofEMI16.1 was reacted with Et3N pyridine 1 1 v v for 3 hours at room temperature and evaporated under vacuum to an oil.The product1EMI16.2 was condensed withEMI16.3 in anhydrous pyridine in the presence of 8 mmoles of mesitylene sulphonyl nitro triazole MINT for 1 hour. The reaction was quenched with 5 w v aqueous sodium bicarbonate and extracted with dichloromethane. The extract was evaporated under vacuum to an oil and the product purified by chromatography on silica using a gradient of dichloromethane to 10 MeOH dichloromethan e. The product V was treated with Et3N pyridine 1 1 vSv to remove the cyanoethyl protecting group and evaporated under vacuum to a solid foam VI in an overall yield of 75 . The solid was stored at 200C ready for use in oligonucleotide synthesis. 100 mg of the polymer support with DMTrT attached was treated sequentially with 1 2 bovine serum albumin BSA in dichloromethane butanol 7 3 for 5 minutes 2 dichloromethane butanol.. 7 3 x 5 3 dry pyridine x 5 4 100 mg dinucleotide and 100 mg MSNT in 0.5 ml dry pyridine for 45 minutes 5 dry pyridine x 2 6 10 acetic anhydride pyridine for 10 minutes 7 dry pyridine x 2 8 dichloromethane butanol 7 3 x 5 This cycle was repeated with the appropriate dinucleotide until the oligonucleotide chain was complete.The coupling efficiency at each stage was determined by spectrophotometric assay of the liberated dimethoxytrityl alcohol at 504 nm. At the completion of the synthesis, the oligonucleotide was removed from the polymer support and all protecting groups removed by sequential treatment with 0.5 M 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl guanidinium nitrobenzaldoximate for 48 hours at room temperature, concentrated ammonia for 5 hours at 700C and 80 acetic acid for 30 minutes at room temperature. The deprotected oligonucleotides were purified by ion exchange HPLC. Hybridisation and ligation of oligomeric nucleotide blocks The series of steps in the construction of theB chain duplex is illustrated in Figure 12 of the accompanying drawings. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with 0.25 mMATP and 500 pCi E3 ATP per ml 50 mM Tris HCl tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloride pH 9.4, 10 m MgC12, 5 mM dithiothreitol DTT containing from 100 to 150 pg of oligonucleotxde per ml and 125 units 1 unit is the amount that catalyses the production of 1 nmole of acid insoluble 32P after incubation for 30 minutes at 370C according to Richardson, C.C., 1972 ,Progress in Nucleic Acids Research, 2, 815 per ml of T4 polynucleotide kinase EC 2.7.1.78 . The phosphorylated oligonucleotides were precipitated with ethanol and purified on a 20 w v polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. After elution from the gel, the recovery was determined by Cerenkov counting. In the ligation of, for example, blocks 11 and 13 12.5 pmoles 5 OH relaxin 11, 10 pmoles 5 32P relaxin 13 and 10 pmoles 5 OII relaxin 12 in 50 p1 of water were annealed by heating to 1000C, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The mixture was lyophilised and taken up in 20 p1 of ligase solution 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgC12, 20 mM DTT and 250 pm ATP containing 200 units 1 unit is the amount that catalyses the con version of 1 nmole of 32PPi into alpha beta 32P ATP in 20 minutes at 370C according to Weiss, B., et al, 1968 , J. Biol. Chem., 243, 4543 of T4 DNA ligase EC 6.5.1.1 .After 18 hours at 220C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 p1 of 4 M ammonium acetate, 10 Mg of tRNA and 3 volumes of ethanol. After precipitation, the product was purified on a 15 polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions.Cloning of A gene in pWT 571 pWT 571 was cleaved with restriction endonucleasesEcoRI EC 3.1.4.32 and Hind III EC 3.1.23.21 according to the manufacturers instructions New England Biolabs,Inc. Beverley MD, USA and the 3628 bp fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis 18 low gelling temperature agarose Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc Gaitharsburg, MD, USA in 0.09 M Tris HCl pH 8.3, 2.5 mM sodium EDTA, 0.089 M boric acid . The large band was removed by melting the slice of agarose at 65 C, extracting with phenol CHC13 1 1 v v and precipitating with ethanol.The A gene was ligated to the plasmid in a 20 pl mixture containing 10 pg of A chain gene, 20 pig of the EcoRI Hind III large fragment of pWT 571, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8, 10 mMMgC12, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM DTT, 200 units of T4 DNA ligase New England Biolabs, Inc incubated for 18 hours at 150C. The ligated product was transformed into E coliK12 WT 217 ara Dl39, ara, leu 7697,a lac X74, gal V , gal k , hsr , hsm , str A, rec A56 , using known methods, see, for example, Cohen, et al, 1972 , Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA, 69, 2110 2114 and transformants resistant to 100 pg ml ampicillin selected. Several transformants were further analysed by restriction enzyme cleavage of plasmid DNA, one being selected which was shown to contain a 70 80 bp insert on cleavage with EcoRI andHind III and which contained, apparently within this same insert, a restriction site for Hinf I which is known to be within the A gene. This plasmid,designated pRA 4, was then modified in such a way as to enable the A gene to be expressed.The plasmid was cut with EcoRI. The single strandedDNA tail at each end of the plasmid was removed to yield flush ends by treating with S1 nuclease EC 3.1.4.21 .1.5 pg of EcoRI cut plasmid pRA 4 was incubated with 7.5 units 1 unit is the amount that solubilises 10 pg nucleic acid in 10 minutes at 450Caccording to Vogt, V.M., 1973 , Eur. J. Biochem., 33, 192 of S1 nuclease for 0.5 hours at 150C in 50 pl in 250 mM sodium chloride, 30 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5, 1 mM zinc sulphate. The product was phenol extracted, ethanol precipitated, ligated in a similar way to that described above, except that flush end ligation was favoured by using 800 units of T4 DNA ligase and a temperature of 250C, and used to transform E coli K12WT 217 as before.In this way, the ATG initiator methionine codon adjacent to the EcoRI site in the plasmid pWT 571 is placed next to the first codon of theA chain gene in the plasmid derived from pRA 4 designated pRA 63 such that, under appropriate conditions, expression of the A chain gene occurs. Colonies containing the derived plasmid were selected for ampicillin resistance and the plasmids further selected by the insensitivity thereof to EcoRI treatment. The nucleotide sequence of the region just upstream of the old EcoRI site and including the entire A gene was determined by known methods, see, for example, Maxam, A.M., and Gilbert, W., 1977 , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 74, 560 .Expression of A gene Expression of relaxin A gene was induced by growth of cells in M9 medium containing, per litre, 6 gNa2HPO4, 3 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g NaC1, 1 g NH4C1, 0.25 g MgSo4.7H20, 0.02 g CaC12.6H2O, 5 g casamino acids lacking tryptophan Difco , 5 g glucose, 1 mg thiamine and 100 mg carbenicillin a carboxy benzylpenicillin Beecham , to an A600flm of 0.4. 3 ss indole acrylic acid was added to 20 mg litre and incubated for 4 hours at 370C. Under these conditions, maximal tryptophan promoter activity is known to occur and hence expression of theA chain, see, for example, published G.B., PatentApplication No. 2,068,970 . Expression of the B and B C A genes was induced in a similar manner. Cloning of B gene in pWT 551 Initially, the gene was inserted into pAT 153 and cloned. pAT 153 was restricted with restriction endonucleases Cla I and Bam HI EC 3.1.23.6 , BethesdaResearch Laboratories and the resulting large fragment purified by electrophoresis on low gelling temperature agarose and extracted as previously described. The B gene was ligated to this plasmid fragment, the ligated product used to transform E coli K12 WT 217 and the transformants selected for ampicillin resistance as previously described. Several transformants were further analysed by restriction enzyme cleavage of plasmid DNA to confirm the presence of a 100 bp insert containing restriction sites for Sal I Hinc II , Hind III, Bgl II, Rsa I and bounded by sites for Cla I and Bam HI. Next, the B gene was transferred from pAT 153 to an expressing site in pWT 551. pAT 153 containing the B gene was cut with restriction enzyme Cla I and treated with S1 nuclease as previously described, using 10 units of S1 nuclease with 10 pg plasmid DNA in order to remove the single stranded DNA at each end of the plasmid. In order to ensure flush ends, the plasmid was treated with DNA polymerase I EC 2.7.7.7 . 10 pg of Cla I, S1 treated plasmi was incubated at 150C for 20 minutes with 20 units 1 unit is the amount that incorporates 10 nmoles of total nucleotides into an acid precipitable fraction in 30 minutes at 370C using poly d A T as primer according to Richardson, C.C., et al, 1964 , J. Biol. Chem., 239, 222 of DNA polymerase I large fragment Bethesda Research Laboratories in 100mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 10 mM MgC12, 4 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 InN of each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP in 100 p1. The plasmid was then cut with restriction enzyme Ava I and the resulting smaller fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. pWT 551 was cut with restriction enzyme Hind III, then treated with S1 nuclease and DNA polymerase I as described above in order to remove the single stranded ends of the plasmid The product was cut with Ava I and the larger fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The two fragment thus produced were ligated under conditions which favour flush end ligation described above and used to transform E coli K12 WT 217 as before. Recombinants containing pWT 551 with the insertedB chain were detected by the size of the intact plasmids, by the presence of the restriction sites within the B gene and the size of the B gene insert. Absolute confirmation of the presence of the definitive B gene, as well as the part of the plasmid flanking the 5 end of the gene, was obtained by nucleotide sequencing. As mentioned above, an alternative approach involved producing a B gene with a flush 5 terminus from its constituent oligomers oligomer ATGCAGTC being used in place of CGATGCAGTC in accompanying Figure 8 and to insert this into pWT 551 which has been treated withHind III and Bam HI the Hind III end having been flushended with S1 nuclease . Recombinants were screened as described above. Since the S1 treatment was occasionally incomplete or excessive, recombinants containing the B gene were produced by these two methods which possessed from one to six bases in excess of or less than the desired plasmid in the region corresponding to the ribosome binding site next to the B gene. The expression of the B gene is affected by the sequence of this region. Cloning of hybrid B C A gene in pWT 551 pWT 551 containing the B gene at the Trp expression site was treated with restriction enzymesBgl II and Bam HI and the large fragment purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The B C A gene was ligated to this fragment and used to transform E coliK12 WT 217 as described above. Several transformants were analysed by restriction enzyme cleavage of plasmid DNA to confirm the presence of a 119 bp insert in the desired orientation containing restriction sites for Rsa I, Xma I,Hinf I, Bst NI and bounded by sites for Bgl II andBam HI. The nucleotide sequence of a selected plasmid was determined to confirm the presence of the desired gene.
