## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nhe present invention relates to a polyvalent stimulating compouna ror vegetables,ihich is realiz ed in the rors or high duration and erficiency artificial rock,particularly erfective to integrally exploit the natural sources, everywhere they are present, in order to increase the agricultural yield, in the most economical way and with a greater respect of the ecological environment. The ever increasing world rood request,ihich imposes intensive tilling systems, has determined a quick structural and biological alteration of the tillable soils, depending on the increasing consumption of the vitally important raw material natural sources. She uncontrolled ase of excessive amounts of chemical manure or fertilizers, which is considered as indispensable in order to obtain a high agricultural yield, has determined an excessive waste or noble raw materials, such as phosphorites and potassium salts, while requiring a high power waste for producing the nitrogen compounds. Accordingly even the production of primary necessity rood materials is presently eicessively expensive. Moreover the chemical manure or fertilizers are generally supplied to soil in unbalanced amounts, thereby they are accumulated in the waste water and basins,polluting the latter and originating the well known eutophry and high nitrite contents phenomena.Also the increasing worsening of the workea soil physical structure is a logical consequence or the overintensive exploiting, deriving rroi a rorced mechanical derlocculation and rrom the exhaustion or the humus and calcium reserves preexisting in the soil surrace prorile,since those two elements are indispensable ror preserving the soil structure and integrally exploiting the chemical administered manure or rertilizers. This situation is rurther worsened by some new soil treating or working techniques which do not carry out a deep ploughlag thereby leaving on the surface always the same already exploited soil. This surrace worsened condition,rurther aggravated by the aestroying action on the overall worked or treated surface by the elastic force or the trapped air, also causes serious problems or hydrogeological ana alluvial nature the erosion of the rruitrul soil in Italy is greater than 1,000,000,000 m3 per year . The ever increasing sinking or the supply water bearing strata clearly indicates that, since the impermeability of the surface soil does not assure a gradual absorption or the rain water, a lack of balance occurs on the natural continuum existing rrom the water bearing strata to the water of rivers and lakes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the main object of the present invention is to eliminate the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks, by providing a fertilizing product effective to be made starting fram unexpensive and easily available materials, which heretofore were considered or poor agricultural value,and effective to provide,also depending on the treating method used for mixing said ma terials, great increments in the restructuring and exploiting of the soil, in the most economic manner and with great energy savings on the field. More specifically, the present invention proposes a product obtained by combining the tollow ing naturally occurring elements 1 powder calcium oxide lump calcium oxide newly formed calcium hydroxide 2 river sand,mainly of the siliceous type sea sand quartz rock powder pure quartz powder mainly sandy screened soil material quarry sand hydrated silica gels and the like material quartz stone and rock working and cutting wastes 3 thin wood sawdust,preferably of the sweet type dried vegetable waste powder peat bumus screened saterial hydrolizea wood and the like material working wastes from extraction treatings or vegetable materials such as sugar beets, sugar cane, olives and the like. While the rates or the several components may be varied depending on the dirferent used materials, the functional characteristics of the obtained product are never completely repressed. A volumetric torsula which has been round to be an optimal one in the experimentation tests is the roll owing 1 Powder calcium oxide 30 2 hin river sand 60 3 Nhin poplar wood sawdust 10 Advantageously the homogeneous mixing step ol the product components may precede the hydrating step there or. On the other hand, as lump lime is used, the hydrating step of the latter must Immediately precede the mixing step with the other two components. Ehe simultaneous hydrating step of the three components or materials, which are continuously held in motion by a mixing device as rar as they are saturated and amalgamate8, originates important hydrolysis phenomena of the components. Intact, there is integrally exploited the maximum hydrolizing power, as determined by the isotermic reaction occurring during the transforma tion of the calcium oxide to calcium hydroxide. The strong alkaline reaction and the simultaneous temperature increasing easily cause, dupe to the introduction or the OH into the cristalline lattice of the siliceous material, the peripheral crystal breaking ana the formation of polar activity channels. e simultaneous hydrolysis or the organic material allows for the neogenic product to be rictitiously cemented, in such a way as to be easily attacked by the soil circulating waters. All of the mentioned advantageous characteristics of the obtained neogenic product are stressed to a maximum degree if the remixing step of the fluidic mass is prolonged for a time period after the mere amalgamation. ffhe subsequent product crashing step the most suitable size being that corresponding to a rice grain may be carried out by any suitable method, depending on the available apparas, to the state of a dehydrated aggregate or to that corresponding to a definitive drying or the fluidic mass. The most avantageous drying step is the natural one,leaving the product under a roof structure, possibly provided with a transparent roof every useful there have been found the quartz glasses . Accordingly the present invention also comprises the method for preparing the subject product grains,which method comprises,more specifically,the step or hemogeneously mixing the thereinabove mentioneff components as the calcium oxide is in powder form,hydrating saia components while mixing, thereby obtaining saturation and amalgamation thereof, causing the mixture to rest in order to cause the mass to set,and then crashing and drying, preferably ia a natural manner. According to a variation of the subject method, as lump lime is used,it is possible to carry out the lime hydrating step immediately before the mixing thereof with the other components. rhe neogenic artificial rock grains obtained according to the invention, upon spreading on the soil, cause the following phenomena and advantages 1 the product acts as a consant and long life regulator slackened solubilization or the acid pH of the circulating solution, due to the slow and continuous introduction into solution or the ion, as briage rlocculating cation and physiologic supply for the root ends of the tilled vegetable materials 2 a sensible improving or the soil structure and preserving thereof cementing action ,also with respect to the humus substances which are present in the soil profile 3 generation of hydrogen carbonates HCO3 in aqueous solution, which ion is constantly useful and present in the circulating solution,being moreover indispensable ror the solubilization and use by the vegetables or the microelements which are present in the soil 4 a constant and long life production or hydrolized gel neogenic compounds, provided with a self evident nitrogenasic activity 5 an optimum performance within the soil,as an inorganic sublayer very useful as a protecting receptacle for the develo.pmeat of nitrogen fixing micro organisms which is an indirect type of action, effective to favour in a maximum degree the induction and exploiting of the natural nitrogen b an integral exploiting of the phosphate and potassium based used manure, thereby giving a greater activation effect in the ionic exchange and by means of a constant antagonist action 7 auxinic stimulation of great power and duration, effective to provide very large yield increments, also from a quality standpoint t3 a gradual recovery of the absorbtion power or the agricultural soils 9 a greater protection of the environment and the water bearing strata from the toxic agricultural wastes 10 a remarkable enhancing of the crop yield, also with respect to recycled erganic substances, with average values of the order of 30 experimental test data . While some embodiments of the invention have been thereinabove illostratively disclosed those skilled in the art will be easily able of providing for several modifications and variations, which are to be considered as Walling within the scope of the invention.
