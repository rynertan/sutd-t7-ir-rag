# Thermostatically controlled valve, method of making same and apparatus for performing the method.

## Abstract
A thermostatically controlled valve, of the type used in a cooling system of an internal combustion engine, has a temperature responsive actuating member 30 , for opening and closing the valve, in the form of a metal coil 30 having shape memory effect such that its modulus of elasticity increases rapidly at a critical temperature. The actuating member is calibrated prior to assembly in the valve by heating the member to the critical temperature and reducing its length to that at which the valve will begin to open by cutting the member whilst preventing overheating.
