# Electronic phase sequence indicator for three phase electric systems.

## Abstract
An electronic phase sequence indicator for three phase electric system. It serves to individuate the cyclic sequence order of the three phases. The apparatus is composed of a single phase indicator detector having an ammeter circuit and a voltmeter circuit suitably con nected with resistors and condensers, or else with in ductances and capacitors. It is provided with a ferromagnetic core upon which the electric ammeter circuit acts, obtained with a small sized coil composed of a very thin copper wire wound according to an extremely large number of turns. Be tween the pole pieces of the ferromagnetic circuit the voltmeter moving element is placed, which is composed of a small frame, free to rotate, upon which the voltmeter small coil is wound, which is composed of many turns of a very thin copper wire. Upon the axle of the small frame two spiral springs are keyed which have the functions of determining the counteracting torque and of vonveying the voltmeter current to the small coil. Upon the axle of the voltmeter moving element also the pointer of the de vice is keyed which, in the rest position, is situated at the center of the dial of the device. The indicator detector is provided with a dial of the center zero type, divided by a line into two sectors, each of which shows suitable indications, red and green colored, for the correct and simple use of the sequence phase indicator. In order to avoid the oscillations of the pointer, the moving element may be provided with a damping device which may be of the air or the electromagnetic type.
