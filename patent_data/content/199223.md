1. A method of obtaining substantially purified immunoglobulin G from a sample of biological fluid containing said immunoglobulin G which comprises separating and recovering said immunoglobulin G from said sample by employing liquid chromatography or solid phase extraction wherein the chromatographic packing or solid phase matrix, respectively, consists essentially of the carboxylated covalently bound, non crosslinked polyethylenimine reaction product of particulate silica gel having an average particle diameter of from about 3 to about 70 microns and an average pore size of from about 50 to about 1000 Angstrom units, or particulate controlled pore glass having an average particle diameter of from about 37 to about 177 microns and an average pore size of from about 40 to about 1000 Angstrom units, with polyethyleniminopropyl trimethoxy silane having an average molecular weight of from about 400 to about 1800.

## Description
In accordance with the present invention, a carboxylated form of the covalently bound, non cross linked polyethylenimine reaction product of particu late silica gel having an average particle diameter of from about 3 to about 70 microns and an average pore size of from about 50 to about 1000 Angstrom units, or particulate controlled pore glass having an average particle diameter of from about 37 to about 177 microns and an average pore size of from about 40 to about 1000 Angstrom units, with polyethylenimino propyl trimethoxy silane having an average molecular weight of from about 400 to about 1800, is utilized as the solid phase in chromatographic or extraction processes to obtain substantially purified immuno globulin G from biological fluids. In U.S. Patent No. 4,469,630 of M. Flashner, entitled Purification of Monoclonal Antibodies , the purification of monoclonal antibody type IgG is described using the non carboxylated form of the above described covalently bound, non crosslinked polyethylenimine reaction product. It has now been surprisingly found that the carboxylated form of said reaction product, which forms a cation exchange ma trix, effectively and selectively binds the IgG anti bodies are present in biological fluids. Further more, whereas the non carboxylated anion exchange matrix described in U.S. Patent No. 4,469,630 binds most of the ascites fluid proteins, then selectively separates the IgG antibody, the carboxylated cation exchange matrix herein employed binds primarily the IgG antibody, leaving most of the other proteinaceous material in the biological fluid unbound. It is very unusual, and not to be predicted, that protein will bind to both an anionic positively charged and a cationic negatively charged matrix in essentially the same pH range. The invention relates, in its preferred embodi ment, to a method of separating and purifying immuno globulin G IgG antibody from biological fluids containing same utilizing liquid column chromato graphy on a particular stationary porous phase of a carboxylated form of silica gel or controlled pore glass CPG bearing non cross linked covalently bound polyethylenimine PEI functions and gradient elution of the IgG antibody from the carboxylated polyethyl enimine bound silica gel or CPG column with aqueous buffer of from about pH 5.5 to about pH 8.3. The invention also relates to a method of separating and purifying said IgG antibody from biological fluids utilizing solid phase extraction means with said carboxylated material as the solid phase matrix. The particular carboxylated form of silica gel bearing non crosslinked covalently bound polyethylen imine functions, hereinafter sometimes referred to as carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel , and the particu lar carboxylated form of controlled pore glass bear ing non crosslinked covalently bound polyethylenimine functions, hereinafter sometimes referred to as car boxylated PEI PrSi CPG , for purposes of convenience, which are utilized in this invention, are described in EP A 143 423. Relevant text of this application is re produced below. The non crosslinked covalently bound PEI silica gel and glass products of the present invention are conveniently prepared in accordance with the follow ing steps As used herein, the term covalently bound or covalently bonded means that the PEI moieties are covalently attached to the silica gel or controlled pore glass by way of chemical interaction resulting in a propyl silyl Pr Si linkage and the term non crosslinked means that the imino and amino groups on adjacent covalently bound PEI moieties are not cross linked, or reacted with a crosslinking agent, to form a polymeric layer. Without being bound thereby, it is believed that the reaction proceeds to completion in two steps as follows Silica gel, consisting of amorphous silica, is commercially available in irregular and spherical preferred particulate forms and in several commer cial grades with mesh sizes ranging from 3 through 325 ASTM . Rather than relying upon a numerical indication of mesh size, however, more accurate indi cia for purposes of this invention are the average diameter and average pore size of the silica gel par ticles, respectively, from about 3 to about 70 microns and from about 50 to about 1000, preferably 250 500, Angstrom units. For end product use in packing HPLC chromatographic columns, a silica gel starting material of from about 3 to about 10 microns is preferred, and, for packing low pressure chromato graphic columns, from about 40 to about 70 microns is preferred. Controlled pore glass CPG , which is a silicate containing support material chemically similar to silica for use in liquid chromatography, is commer cially available, for example, from the Pierce Chemi cal Co., Rockford, Illinois, with average particle diameter of 37 177 microns and average pore size of 40 1000 Angstroms, preferably 40 500 Angstrons. Among the inert organic solvents suitable for preparing the silica gel or CPG slurry are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, hexane, heptane and the like aromatic hydrocarbons such as, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene and the like lower alkanols such as, for example, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol and the like chlorinated methanes such as, for example, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and the like Caution such chloro solvents may react at higher temperatures and such other inert solvents as tetrahydrofuran, glyme, di glyme and the like. In general a 1 5 ratio of silica gel or CPG in grams to solvent in milliliters affords a suitable slurry. Due to the fine, insoluble nature of the particulate silica gel and CPG, a slurry rather than a true solution is obtained. Polyethyleniminopropyl trimethoxy silane, also known as N trimethoxysilylpropyl polyethylenimine, is the reaction product of polyethylenimine and aminopropyltrimethoxy silane and can be represented by the following formula The silane I is used in the reaction with the silica gel or CPG in the form of a lower C₁ C₆ alkan olic solution using sufficient alkanol to solubilize the silane. A fifty percent w w isopropanolic solu tion is preferred. In general, about 25 100 grams of the silane, or, alternatively, about 50 200 ml of a fifty percent w w alkanolic solution of the silane, is used to react with each 100 grams silica gel or CPG. The reaction may be conducted at ambient tem perature although elevated temperatures up to the refluxing temperature of the reaction solvent system may be utilized to enhance the rate of reaction. The reaction proceeds readily to substantial completion Step 1 within 2 50 hours. Stirring during admix ture of the reactants is advantageously employed although the reaction thereafter may continue without further stirring. Anhydrous conditions are not critical, it having been found that the presence of a small amount of water, for example, about 0.1 1.0 ml per 50 ml of the slurry solvent, does not adversely affect the reaction. The resultant solid fraction is recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional physical means, for example, filtration, centrifugation, etc. In general, a filtering means sufficient to retain a particle size of 5 microns is suitable whereas cen trifuging is suitable for a particle size of 3 microns. The recovered solid fraction is then heat cured at a temperature and for a time sufficient to dry and completely bond the silane to the silica gel or CPG covalently. In general, from about 1 4 hours at about 40 120 C has been found sufficient. The thus obtained covalently bound, non crosslinked final product preferably contains from about 0.5 to about 3.8 percent nitrogen. The thus obtained weakly basic PEI PrSi silica gel or PEI PrSi CPG products may be converted to a weakly acidic carboxylated form by conventional treatment, for example, see S. Gupta et al., Anal. Biochem. The aforementioned weakly acidic carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel and carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG products of Ramsden, which are the N acylated reac tion products of a dibasic acid anhydride such as, for example, succinic acid anhydride preferred , glutaric acid anhydride, diglycolic acid anhydride and the like, with the imino and amino functions on the PEI moiety of the PEI PrSi silica gel or PEI PrSi CPG, are the solid phase materials utilized in the chromatographic and extraction methods of purifi cation of this invention. Said caboxylated products of Ramsden are those wherein the starting silica gel has an average par ticle diameter of from about 3 to about 70 microns and an average pore size of from about 50 to about 1000 Angstrom units, preferably about 250 500 Ang stroms wherein the starting controlled pore glass CPG has an average particle diameter of from about 37 to about 177 microns and an average pore size of from about 40 to about 1000 Angstrom units, prefer ably about 40 500 Angstroms wherein the starting polyethyleniminopropyl trimethoxy silane, which is subsequently bound to the particulate silica gel or the particulate CPG in covalently bound non cross linked form, has an average molecular weight of from about 400 to about 1800 and wherein the residual carboxylic acid functionality of the dibasic acid segment the carboxyl of said segment being terminal ly located attached to the imino and amino functions on the PEI moiety preferably provides a carboxyl milliequivalent per gram of carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG product of about 0.3 1.2. Accordingly, the instant invention provides a method of obtaining substantially purified immuno globulin G, also known as antibody type IgG, from a biological fluid containing same, such as, for ex ample, plasma, serum, supernatent fluid from tissue culture cells producing IgG antibody, ascites fluid and the like, by employing either liquid chromato graphy or solid phase extraction wherein the liquid chromatographic packing or the solid phase extraction matrix comprises said particulate carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG. It has now been found that such chromatographic packing or solid phase matrix is particularly useful in liquid chromatography and solid phase extraction for preferentially selectively binding IgG anti bodies and removing it from most other proteins in the biological fluid. The bound IgG antibody may then be eluted from the solid phase matrix in sub stantially purified form, or may be further separated and purified from the small amount of other bound protein in liquid chromatography, by gradient elution using appropriate aqueous buffers. As used herein substantially purified means that greater than 70 of the protein present in the quantitatively recovered IgG antibody fraction is the IgG antibody. Indeed, in the preferred process of this invention, liquid chromatography, more than 90 of the protein, i.e., essential homogeneity, in the quantitatively recovered IgG antibody fraction is the IgG antibody. The percent purity may be verified by known proce dures in the art, such as, for example, by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis see U. K. Laemmli, Nature, 227, 680 1970 . The instant invention is suitable for use with biological fluids containing IgG antibody such as, for example, plasma, serum, tissue culture supernat ant, ascites fluid e.g., mouse or rat ascites fluid and the like. The term immunoglobulin G or IgG antibody includes all monoclonal and polyclonal IgG antibodies and subclasses of the IgG type, for ex ample, IgG₁, IgG The isolation of IgG antibody in highly purified form is obviously desirable. For example, for in vivo therapeutic purposes, IgG antibody as pure and as concentrated as possible is required to minimize adverse side effects and to maximize the intended therapeutic purpose. Similarly, for in vitro diag nostic purposes, such purified and concentrated anti body is desirable to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the particular diagnostic test. Preferably, the biological fluid containing IgG antibody is pre treated to remove interfering partic ulate matter and is equilibrated to the appropriate ionic strength and pH necessary to achieve binding of the IgG antibody to the carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG solid phase mater ial. The interfering particulate matter can be re moved by conventional clarifying means, for example, by filtration or by centrifugation at a force suffi cient to pelletize the particulate material. Equili bration of the biological fluid can be achieved by any means common to the state of the art, for ex ample, by chromatographic desalting with an appro priate buffer on molecular sieves of appropriate type and pore size such as those commercially available under the brand name Sephadex , by dilution with or dialysis against an appropriate buffer, and the like, to equilibrate the biological fluid to a pH less than the pH that pH at which the monoclonal antibody carries no net ionic charge in its environment of the particular IgG antibody but no lower than pH 5.5 and to an ionic strength equal to or less than the ionic strength of the lower ionic strength buffer used for elution in the subsequent treatment of the biological fluid. For the purification by liquid chromatography to essential homogeneity, chromatographic columns suit able for use in liquid chromatography are packed with the previously described carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG porous chromatogra phic matrix. Suitable steel or glass chromatographic columns include those having dimensions of about 5 100 cm in length and internal diameters of about 1 100 mm. Selection of the proper chromatographic parameters such as, for example, column packing tech nique, column size, column temperature, pressure and the like, are readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The packed column is equilibrated in a chromato graph by passing an appropriate buffer solution through the column. After this buffer equilibration step, the column is used to make the chromatographic separation of the proteinaceous components of the biological fluid which, as noted, may have been pre viously freed of particulate matter and equilibrated to the appropriate ionic strength and pH. A sample of the biological fluid is applied to the buffer equilibrated column to selectively bind the IgG anti body and minor contaminating proteins to the respec tive carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxy lated PEI PrSi CPG chromatographic packing material. The bound IgG antibody can then be selectively eluted by conventional gradient elution techniques, taking into consideration the interdependent chroma tographic parameters of time, flow rate and gradient shape to generate gradients of increasing ionic strength and or increasing pH. Cationic buffers, for example, potassium phosphate, tris acetate, ammonium acetate, sodium chloride and the like, of from about pH 5.5 to about 8.3 can be used to generate such gradients to elute the bound IgG selectively from the carboxylated packing material. For example, the gradient can be advantageously formed from about one half hour to about four hours with a flow rate of from about 0.1 mL min to about 2 L min. Alternatively, the bound antibody along with minor impurities can be eluted in a single step by a buffer solution of sufficiently high ionic strength to release the bound antibody in substantially puri fied form. Such a method of selective binding and subsequent single step elution may be described as solid phase extraction, which may be carried out in a column as described above or in a batch process. In the latter, the solid phase matrix of carboxylated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG is stirred with the equilibrated biological fluid then the matrix and fluid are separated by conventional means such as decantation or centrifugation, and the IgG antibody is subsequently eluted from the matrix by stirring with an aqeuous buffer of appropriate ionic strength to release the bound IgG antibody. The resolved proteins can be identified by any means common to the state of the art, for example, by monitoring the ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm. The eluent fractions containing the separated proteins can be collected manually or by use of a fraction collector. The eluent fraction containing the homo geneous IgG antibody can be identified by means well established in the art such as, for example, by a radioimmunoassay developed for the particular anti body, by other antibody antigen reactions, or by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The process of this invention has been found to be independent of the total volume of the biological fluid containing the IgG antibody and there is no limiting factor except for the amount of the carboxy lated PEI PrSi silica gel or carboxylated PEI PrSi CPG used as the solid chromatographic packing or solid phase matrix that is, the process is operable so long as the capacity of the solid support is not surpassed. In accordance with the method of the present invention, therefore, a biological fluid containing antibody type IgG is separated by liquid chromato graphy or solid phase extraction to provide said antibody in substantially purified form.
