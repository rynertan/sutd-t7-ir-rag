# Improved tape guidance for belt driven cartridge.

## Abstract
A tape cartridge 10 of the type including walls 12, 14 defining an enclosure in which a magnetic tape 30 is direc ted along a tape guidance path adjacent an edge 54 of the cartridge 10 for access by a magnetic transducer 42 fur ther includes at least three pins 20 28 bearing against one or both major surfaces of the tape 30 in a direction perpen dicular to the plane of the tape 30 , an enlarged shoulder 56, 58, 64, 66, 68 extending from each of the pins 20 28 toward the tape 30 to bear upon an edge 60, 62 of the tape 30 and provide a containment force parallel to the plane of the tape 30 and in a direction transverse to the direction of tape 30 motion. The shoulders 56, 58, 64, 66, 68 of the pins 20 28 are arranged alternately along the tape 30 path so that the shoulders 56, 58, 64, 66, 68 of successive pins 20 28 bear against opposite edges 60, 62 of the tape 30 , and the pla nes containing the shoulders 56, 58, 64, 66, 68 are spaced a distance equal to or less than the width of the tape 30 to ensure contact between all of the shoulders 56, 58, 64, 66, 68 and the tape edges 60, 62 and positive confinement of the tape 30 in the direction transverse to tape 30 motion.
