## Description
Trolley for automatically loading frames with bread loaves, in particular associable with moulding machines for said loavesThis industrial invention patent relates to a trolley for automatically loading frames with bread loaves, in particular associable with moulding machines for said loaves.In the known art, a frame support trolley is used provided with fixed shelves, each for containing one frame. However, this known design has various drawbacks which are well known to the expert of the art, and in particular the need to manually transfer the loaves from the moulding machine to the frame or, in the case of moulding machines with an incorporated frame, the need to transfer the frame, after loading, on to the trolley. In the case of such moulding machines with an incorporated frame, it is well known that after being moulded, the bread loaves are subjected to a double inversion movement which is certainly not favourable to the proper success of the final product.The object of the present invention is to provide a trolley configured in such a manner that it allows direct transfer of the bread loaves from the moulding machine belt to the frame belt, and the automatic positioning of successive fra mes in front of said moulding machine belt.These and further objects of the invention will be apparent to experts of the art on reading the description and claims given hereinafter.The trolley according to the invention is essentially characterised by comprising a structure for containing a plurality of overlying frame support elements, each element being arranged to support a conventional endless belt frame with a transverse control rod, means for determining the suc cessive positioning of said frame support elements and the relative frame at the level of the discharge belt of said moulding machine, and means for determining the stepwisemo vement of said endless belt of said frame in synchronism with the stepwise movement of said moulding machine dischar ge belt.A preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated diagrammatically by way of non limiting example in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of the trolley in the position for loading the first frame upper Figure 2 shows the trolley in the position for loading the last frame lower Figure 3 is a section on the line III III of figure 1 Figure 4 is a view from above Figure 5 shows a conventional belt type frame.With reference to said figures, the trolley, indicated overall by the reference numeral 1, comprises a metal framework formed from four vertical angle uprights 2, a base 3, a cover 4 and bars 5 for connecting together and reinforcing the uprights 2.The trolley 1 is mounted on idle casters 6 for its manual mao vement.Frame support elements 7, 7 and 7 are disposed parallel to the base 3 and cover 4 between the vertical uprights 2, and each is designed to receive a conventional frame 8 figure 5 constituted by a belt 9 passing endlessly over two idle rollers 10 and provided with a transverse rod 11 for controlling the belt 9 in order to deposit the bread loaves in the oven on extracting said frame 8 from said oven.Each frame support element 7,7 and 7 is constituted by two longitudinal angle members 12 figure 3 and cross members 12 , and has a width to exactly contain one frame 8.The various frame support elements 7, 7 and 7 are guided by the uprights 2, and are connected together at the ends of the longitudinal members 12 by chain portions 13 figure 2 of equal length, there being connected to the ends of the longitudinal members 12 of the upper frame support element 7, at 14 figures 1 and 2 , the ends of four cables 15, 15 and 16, 16 which pass about guide pulleys 17, 17 and 18, 18 idly mounted at the four corners of the cover 4, and wind at their other ends about cable winding drums 19, 19 which are rotated in either direction by a geared motor 20, chain 21 and sprocket wheel 22 also mounted on the cover 4.Two longitudinal members 23 are disposed parallel to the frame support elements 7, 7 and 7 between the uprights 2 at the same level as a conveyor belt 24 of a conventional bread loaf moulding machine indicated overall by 25, and carry idly mounted on their ends distant from the moulding machine 25 two sprocket wheels 26 with their pivot vertical, while on their ends close to said moulding machine the re are mounted a further two sprocket wheels 27, each keyed on to a vertical shaft 28, the upper end of which projects beyond the cover 4 and carries a further sprocket wheel 29 keyed thereon.A chain 30 figure 3 passes endlessly about the pairs of sprocket wheels 26 and 27, and carries suitably spaced apart pairs of fingers 31 only one pair is shown in figure 3 whi ch are positioned so as to engage the projecting parts 11 figure 5 of the rods 11 of the frame 8 which is positioned on that frame support element 7, 7 or 7 located at the level of the conveyor belt 24 of the moulding machine 25.Endless chains 32 figure 4 engage with the sprocket wheels 29, and are driven in one or other direction by a geared motor 33 and transmission 34 mounted on the cover 4. The transmissions 32 and 34 are arranged so that they rotate the ver tical shafts 28 in the same direction and at the same speed.When in operation, the trolley 1 is arranged with its frame support elements 7 and 7 lowered and superposed and the element 7 at the level of the longitudinal members 23 figu re 1 , said elements 7, 7 and 7 each being provided with a frame 8 with its transverse rod 11 disposed to the far left with reference to figure 5, the trolley 1 being moved close to the moulding machine 25 and hooked thereto for example by means of hooks 35. In this position, a pair of fingers 31 en gages with the projecting parts 11 of the rod 11 of the fra me 8 supported by the upper element 7 .The motor for moving the conveyor belt 24 of the moulding ma chine 25 stepwise is synchronised with the geared motor 33 in such a manner that for each movement of the belt 24 thro ugh one step there is a corresponding movement through one step of the fingers 31, and consequently a movement of the belt 9 of the frame 8 through one step arrow F, figure 5 . Thus at each step, a row of bread loaves becomes transferred from the belt 24 on to the belt 9. When the rod 11 reaches the right hand end of the frame 8, a suitable microswitch not shown stops the motor of the moulding machine 25 and the geared motor 33, and starts the geared motor 20, with corresponding raising of the element 7 and the raising, by means of the chain portions 13, of the immediately underlying element 7 until this latter becomes disposed at the same level as the belt 24. When said underlying element 7 reaches this latter level, a further suitable microswitch not shown interrupts operation of the geared motor 20 and again starts the motor of the moulding machine 25, in order to transfer further bread loaves on to another frame 8 car w v t ried by said underlying element 7. This procedure continues until the frame 8 carried by the last element 7 of the set figure 2 becomes filled, after which the trolley 1 is removed from the moulding machine 25 and a further trolley 1 placed in position.The electrical circuit has not been illustrated herein in that it can be constructed in different ways by any expert of the art, and in addition no illustration or description has been given of possible photoelectric cell or similar sy stems for interrupting the operation of the geared motor 33 and drive motor for the belt 24 should a complete row of bre ad loaves not be present at the discharge end of said belt 24.
