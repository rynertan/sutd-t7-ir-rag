# A method of and an arrangement for regulating the phase position of a controlled signal in relation to a reference signal in a telecommunication system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for regulating the phase position of a controlled signal in relation to the phase position of a reference signal in a telecommunica tion system, and an arrangement for carrying out the method. The reference signal C2 is delayed in a delay cir cuit DL1 and the delayed reference signal D1 is com pared with a controlled signal C1 in a first comparison circuit FF1 which produces a first comparison signal Q1 at a high or a low level in dependence on the phase differ ence between the delayed reference signal D1 and the controlled signal C1 . The controlled signal C1 is delayed in a delay circuit DL2 and the delayed controlled signal D2 is compared in a second comparison circuit FF2 with reference signal C2 . The second comparison circuit FF2 produces a second comparison signal Q2 which is at a high or a low level in dependence on the phase difference between the signal D2 and the reference signal C2 . The outputs from the comparison circuits FF1 , FF2 are con nected to a logic circuit LC . In dependence on the signal combination received at its inputs the logic circuit pro duces a binary control signal which is used to correct the phase position of the controlled signal C1 in relation to the phase position of the reference signal C2 .
