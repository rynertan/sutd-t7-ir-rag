## Description
It is known that the presence of hydrophilic substances is necessary to make polyamide 6 hydrophilic when used in the field of fibers. Among said hydrophilic substances, polyethylene glycol PEG and polyethylene oxide are by far the most used, the latter having the advantage that it is widely used in the industry and inexpensive. Techniques to add PEG to polyamides generally, including polyamide 6, are The known art teaches that susceptibility to reaction in the case of the above techniques is acquired through the following roads Polycondensation takes place in the presence of titanium, zirconium or hafnium catalysts in a high vacuum condition U.S. 4331786, UK 2093469, U.S. 4349661, U.S. 4345052, U.S. 4345064, U.S. 4252920 U.K. 1473972 . Leaving out technique a , which is devoid of actual practicability, techniques b lead to formation of block copolymers. Blocks consist of macromolecural polyamide and polyethylene glycol fragments of different MW and different from one another in particular, distributions of blocks inside the macromolecular chains occur at random. In fact PEG with modified or unmodified terminal groups instances b.1, b. 2 is added together with the polyamide monomers caprolactam when polyamide 6 is being modified . Therefore, naming A the blocks of a whatsoever polyamide and naming B the PEG blocks terminating with hydroxy or various terminals, the distribution of A and B blocks has no foreordained arrangement. Concerning b.3 instance, that A and B sequency may be random or prestablished, as specified hereinafter. As previously stated, the presence of PEG makes homo and co polyamides more or less hydrophilic, according to PEG amounts employed. Such a property is generally welcome when polyamide is used in the textile field a disadvantage exists, however, to the use of PEG modified homo or co polyamides to be employed in fibers, and such disadvantage is that mechanical and textile properties elastic modulus, shrinkage, elongation, etc are poorer in modified fibers as in respect to non modified polyamide or copolyamide fibers. The lowering of properties is heavier when the hydrophilic character of the modified fiber is stronger and therefore water sorption capability is higher. The interference is that known art cannot supply PEG modified polyamides or copolyamides for use in the field of fibers, having mechanical and textile properties comparable to those of polyamide per se for any amount of water sorbed by the modified fiber. Filaments comprising PEG modified nylon 6 having a modulus comparable to that of conventional nylon 6 fiber are disclosed in a former patent USA 3593266 , but the disclosed filament is a composed one of the sheath core type, that is a filament having a concentrical rings cross section, wherein a block copolymer component is associated to a conventional polyamide that is present in prevailing amounts. In It is an object of this invention to provide polyethylene glycol modified polyamide or copolyamide polymers suitable to production of fibers, filaments and textile manufactured goods, combining good mechanical and textile properties that can be compared to chose of unmodified polyamide to the hydrophilic character that is present in all thus modified polyamides. It is a further object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of said polymers, through which they can be obtained with the proper structure and inherent properties, in a controlled and orderly way. It is a still further object of this invention to provide polymers of the above type and a process for the preparation thereof, consenting to obtain fibers, filaments and textile manufactured goods having a high degree of dyeability beside a hydrophilic character and high rate mechanical and textile properties. We have now unexpectedly found that the above aims can be reached through the provision of a regular structure linear block copolymer comprising polyamide and polyethylene glycol blocks, characterized in that it comprises two polyamide blocks A bound through an intermediate polyethylene glycol block B , according to the structural scheme A B A . The polyamide blocks have an average molecular weight of 5,000 to 15,000, and preferably of 7,000 to 12,000, while the polyethylene blocks have an average molecular weight of 600 to 10,000, preferably of 1,000 to 5,000. The block copolymer A B A has terminal amino groups combined in the form of salts so as to make them capable of capturing a dye during the colouring process. The block copolymers of the invention have a relative viscosity of between 2.1 and 2.7, preferably between 2.2 and 2.5. As a rule, the bond between a polyethylene glycol block and the adjoining polyamide blocks may be either an ester bond, that is a bond coming from the reaction of a carboxy and an hydroxy group, or an amide bond, that is a bond coming from the reaction of a carboxy and an amino group. According to the invention, the preferably used polyamide is polycapronamide also name polyamide 6 or nylon 6 , which is usually obtained through polymerization of caprolactam. Fibers and filaments having high mechanical properties in addition to high moisture sorption and high dyeability are obtained from the invention copolymers adopting known melt spinning methods. Such high physical and mechanical properties of fibers and filaments of the invention are detailed as follows. Moisture sorption on the fibers is a function of the amount of PEG that is present in A B A copolymers with PEG amounts of between 6 and 9 , the moisture content as determined after saturation at 20 C and 95 relative moisture is of 13 17 , instead of 8 9 as in regular nylon 6. The elastic modulus is similar to nylon 6 and higher than other fibers fibers prepared according to known art examples 1 and 2 . Besides, dyeability is equal or better than for conventional nylon, according to conditions and amounts of molecular weight regulators introduced during polymerization. The invention process for the preparation of block copolymers, which are also included in the scope of the invention, fundamentally comprises the steps of preparation of a polyamide of molecular weight within the above specified limits addition of polyethylene glycol of molecular weight within the above specified limits, and condensation thereof in the intended stoichiometrical ratios apt to the materialization of a A B A structure, in the presence of a catalyst such as hereinafter defined. The starting polyethylene glycol may have terminal hydroxy or amino groups, and final condensation conditions are dictated by the structure thereof. Specifically, if the polyethylene terminal groups are hydroxy, polymerization should take place under high vacuum. The polyamide component is prepared by polymerization of the monomer, in particular caprolactam, in the presence of at least one, preferably at least two, molecular weight regulators. Such regulators must, above all, perform establishing the molecular weight of the polyamide that will be a component of the invention block copolymer, so that it remains within the aforementioned boundaries. Further, molecular weight regulators, or at least one of them, must perform in such a way as to consent that a regular A B A structure be obtained. To this end, the polyamide must have one reactive terminal group only, when condensing with polyethylene glycol, in as much as in this way a polyethylene glycol molecule having two reactive terminal groups will bind to each one of the two polyamide terminals, so that continuation of the polymerization process will be impossible and the desired structure is obtained. Under different conditions and if disregarding such stated must the resulting polymer would not be regular, condensation might continue or develop according to random schemes, with production of a random polymer, devoid of the expected properties, so that the problems that the invention does solve would not in fact be solved. On the basis of such criteria, one of the two molecular weight regulators is preferably selected among monocarboxy acids D having an acid dissociation constant K Together, D and F should amount to 50 200 moles 10⁶ g of caprolactam, preferably 90 150 moles 10⁶ g of caprolactam, and the two reactants may be added separately or in the form of a mixture. Specifically, the amount of D component should be 20 170 equiv 10⁶ g, preferably 60 120. The polymerization medium includes caprolactam and water, the latter in an amount of 1 10 by weight, preferably 2 5 by weight of the former, beside D F . The polymerization cycle undergone by caprolactam in a suitable, stirred vessel in the presence of water is well known in the art. The reaction mixture is heated to 240 260 C under 101,3 1519,5 kPa 1 15 atm of autogenous pressure. Then, depressurization of the autoclave is effected. When the autoclave is back to atmospheric pressure, polyethylene glycol component B is added with stirring under a slight nitrogen flow or a slight negative pressure. Polyethylene glycol, if hydroxy terminated, will be present in such an amount that PEG hydroxy groups are in a stoichiometric amount as in respect to carboxy polyamide groups. This criterion also applies if PEG is amino terminated. Therefore the number molecular weight of molten polyamide 6 A should be such that it reacts with PEG B according to the following reaction As a rule, obtained molecular weights will be between 5,000 and 15,000, preferably between 7,000 and 12,000, depending upon amounts of D F used. PEG average molecular weights are of between 600 and 10,000, preferably between 1,000 and 5,000. Therefore copolyamide A B A average molecular weight can be at most of between 11,000 and 40,000, preferably between 15,000 and 29,000. However, said molecular weights may in the practice be lower than stated, because a 100 conversion of COOH and OH groups to ester groups is unnecessary in other words, it is mandatory the amount of A B A sequence be higher than 45 of the theoretical value. Said conversion to A B A can be independent of the amount of PEG contained in the polymeric composition, which is generally between 5 and 10 mass composition mass , preferably between 6 and 9 . As better specified hereinafter, esterification reaction takes place under severe conditions a residual pressure of lower than 266 Pa 2 mm Hg and the presence of a suitable catalyst, at temperatures higher than polyamide 6 melting point 230 260 C . Under such conditions, esterification would be impossible, were not the present amino groups be blocked by F , which prevents them from condensing with polyamide 6 carboxy terminal groups as previously explained . In the absence of any blocking of the amino groups through formation of salts , a very high molecular weight would be obtained of polyamide 6, containing chemically unbound PEG. Therefore, on the basis of what disclosed, reaction 1 can be re written as follows To be more precise, the esterification reaction takes place preferably Reaction conditions appearing under a and b are obvious and they are mentioned in the known art concerning the catalysts, the known art claims the use of titanium tetraderivatives alkoxides U.K. 1473972, U.K. 1518060, U.K. 2011450, U.S. 4331786, U.S. 4345052, U.S. 4252420 or zirconium tetraderivatives U.K. 2093469, U.K. 2011450 . Tetravalent hafnium derivatives alkoxides may also be used, but they have the drawback of a high cost. Other catalysts consisting of organic or inorganic acids benzenesulfonic, hydrochloric and phosphoric acid are employed, but their efficiency is low zinc or antimony compounds can also be used in a polyesterification between A and B blocks, with the disadvantage, however, that the catalyst may undergo reduction and yield the free metal gray besides, their catalytic activity is unsatisfactory. We have experimentally confirmed, according to the known art, that tetravalent titanium, zirconium and hafniu derivatives are active esterification catalysts they show however two drawbacks that limit or even prevent their use when the A B A compositions of this invention are meant for use in the textile field. A first drawback is the high molten state viscosity of the reaction mixture even at low percentages of A B A structures. A high molten state viscosity beyond 6,00 Pa s at 250 C is deleterious because A second drawback is a color formation in the polymer amide ester , which is especially related to the presence of tetraalkoxy titanium obviously, if the polymer is colored to start with, spinning increases the yellow color, according to what discosed. We have now unexpectedly found that, limiting the number of active functions of the catalyst to two, molten viscosity of the material is lower, at an unchanged value of conversion to A B A structures, and, consequently, of the number molecular weight of the material. In other words, the macromolecular is bidimensional instead of tridimensional. This finding makes spinning and subsequent stretching operations easier, affording textile properties comparable to those of nylon 6 filament. Pas viscosity, when operating with such catalysts and under conditions that are described hereinafter, is of between 100 and 500 Pas, a preferred one being of between 150 and 400 Pas with a conversion to A B A of 45 to 75 . On the contrary, when employing a tetrafunctional catalyst at a similar percent conversion to A B A , viscosity is of 600 to 1400 Pas. Suitable catalysts, according to our findings, explanations and claims, consist of a compound of formula OMe OR ₂, wherein Me can be Ti, Zr or Hf, and R is alkyl, aryl, acyl, aroyl, carboxy acyloyl, carboxy aroyl carboxy groups bound to the acyl or aroyl group may be in the form of alkali or alkaline earth metal salts . Amounts of catalyst employed range from 0.05 to 0.5 , based on the whole reaction mass. As said before, an alternative to esterification reaction with hydroxy terminated PEG and a catalyst is to be found in a reaction with amino terminated PEG, and in this case use of a catalyst is superfluous, but the spinned composition will have the same composition and property characters when operating with the invention procedure where a A B A structure is realized after properly converting precursor nylon amino groups to salts. Here follows a description of analytical methods employed for a determination of the indicated variables. The polymer relative viscosity is measured by the ratio of the downflow time for a 1 solution of the polymer in 97.5 sulfuric acid to the downflow time for said sulfuric acid per se. A Ubbelhode viscosimeter is used for the measurements. Free amino groups are determined by acidimetric titration of a solution of the polymer in a phenol methanol solution. As an end point indicator use can be made of thynol blue or of a conductimeter. Total amino groups are determined dissolving the polymer in phenol, precipitating it by the addition of a water acetone mixture, drying the precipitated polymer and titrating total amino groups as specified for free amino groups. Carboxy groups are determined by alkalimetric titration on the polymer dissolved in benzyl alcohol. Phenolphthalein is used as an indicator. Polyethylene glycol content Polyethylene glycol content is determined by a thiosulfate titration of the iodine set free when the polymer is dissolved with warming in phoshoric acid and and sodium iodide. Poise viscosity Poise viscosity is determined with a Melt indexer apparatus as described on ASTM D1238 S7T at 260 C, with a 0.1035 cm radius and 2 cm length capillary, at a speed gradient at the walls γ αµρ 10 sec ¹. Tinctorial absorption to saturation The amount of dyeing matter absorbed onto the fiber is determined using a pH 4, with a 2 solution of Orange II Sandoz . A sample of previously dried filament is kept in a conditioned t 20 C, relative moisture 95 surrounding until it reaches a constant weight. Saturation moisture content is determined by weight difference Preparation of a hydrophilic copolyamide having orderly A B A groups according to the invention. The formed thread properties are comparable to those of a regular polyamide thread, except that it shows a higher moisture sorption. 113 parts caprolactam, 3.39 parts water, 0.44 parts of acetic acid, 1.07 parts benzenesulfonic acid, 0.11 parts of 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene, are warmed to 240 C in a closed vessel provided with stirrer the autogeneous pressure is of at least 303.9 kPa, and such conditions are maintained for 2 hours.

Subsequently, pressure is progressively decreased to 0.3 mm Hg and kept at this value for 3 hours. The cooled and granulated polymer is washed 4 times with 95 C water after drying it shows the following data The copolyamide was spinned and stretched for comparison to polyamide 6. The filaments show the following properties Preparation of a hydrophylic copolyamide wherein amino groups terminated PEG is directly treated with adipic acid and water. The polymer obtained by reaction of diaminic PEG and dicarboxylic polyamide shows random block distribution within the macromolecular chains the properties modulus, shrinkage of the filament are decidedly lower than for a comparable polyamide filament or A B A copolyamide filament of example 1. 113 parts caprolactam, 3.39 parts water, 0 .91 parts adipic acid, 10.27 parts terminal amino groups modified PEG, 0.28 parts 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene are warmed to 240 C in a closed vessel under stirring autogenous pressure is at least 303.9 kPa and such conditions are maintained for 2 hours. Subsequently, pressure is steadily decreased in the vessel to reach a 33.33 kPa residual pressure within 3 hours, and at this value it is maintained for 4 hours. The polymer is cooled and granulated, washed 4 times with 95 C water after drying it shows the following characters The polymer was spun and stretched as in example 1. The obtained filament shows the following properties. Preparation of random block copolyamide, obtained adding polyethylene glycol 2,000 and esterification catalyst directly together with caprolactam the obtained filament has mechanical and textile properties inferior to filament according to claim 1. 113 parts caprolactam, 3.39 parts water, 0.44 parts acetic acid, 1.07 part benzenesulfonic acid, 0.28 parts 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene, 10.27 parts polyethyleneglycol of 2,000 average molecular weight, 0.23 parts potassium titanoxide oxalate dihydrate are heated to 240 C in a closed, stirred reaction vessel autogenous pressure is of at 303.9 kPa, and such conditions are maintained for 2 hours.

The polymer shows a high viscosity in the molten state and is unsuitable to be worked into filament . The procedure of example 1 is used, but employing titanium tetrabutoxide 0.22 parts and a zirconium tetraderivative 0.21 parts . The polymer shows the following characters The polymer was fed to the spinning machine. At 260 C formining the polymer in a thread spinning test is impossible at 280 C extrusion is feasible, but picking up the thread is impossible. Preparation of hydrophilic A B A block copolyamide through copolycondensation of PEG with polyamide precursor having carboxy terminal groups the filament has amino groups in an amount insufficient for dyeing. 100 parts of the obtained polyamide 6 terminating with dicarboxy groups as described in example 2 are reacted with 10.27 parts of M.W. 2,000 polyethylene glycol. The vessel, at 250 C and under stirring, is smoothyl brought down to a 40 Pa 0.3 mm Hg residual pressure and kept in such condition for 3 hours. Once cooled and granulated, the polymer is washed 4 times with 95 C water after drying it shows the following characters Conversion to A B A structure 67 between PEG determination . Preparation of a hydrophilic polymer according to this invention but using a monocarboxy acid only Ka of between 10 ⁵ and 10 ⁴ the produced thread is undyeable when using conventional methods adopted for polyamide fibers, evidencing that additional use of an acid of Ka 10 ¹ as a m.w. regulator is necessary. 113 parts caprolactam, 3.39, parts water, 0.68 parts acetic acid, 0.11 parts of 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene are reacted according to the process of the invention as described in example 1.
