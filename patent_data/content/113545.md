# Packet error rate measurements by distributed controllers.

## Abstract
A trunk controller 131 and processor 115 arrangement for monitoring the error rate occurring in packets received from a a high speed trunk 118 . Within a packet switching system, packets comprising logical addresses and voice data information are communicated through the system by packet switching networks 116 which are interconnected by high speed digital trunks with each of the latter being directly terminated on both ends by trunk controllers. During initial call setup of a particular call, central processors associated with each network in the desired route store the necessary logical to physical address information in the controllers which perform all logical to physical address translation on subsequent packets of the call. Each network comprises stages of switching nodes which are responisve to the physical address associated with a packet by a controller to communicate that packet to a designated subsequent node. Each trunk controller has an error rate monitoring circuit 179 for measuring the error rate occurring in packets during transmission over the attached trunk. The error rate circuit notifies the associated processor when error rate excursions increase or decrease in excess of a multitude of processor specified percentages of error rate.
