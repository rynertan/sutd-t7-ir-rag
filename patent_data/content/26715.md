# Drag flow meter.

## Abstract
A drag flow meter is disclosed of the type having a drag plate 44 disposed in the fluid flow stream, the velocity of which is to be measured. The drag plate 44 is mounted on a cantilevered arm 40 which is pivotally mounted externally of the fluid flow passage, with a tensioned wire 66 counteracting the drag force tending to pivot the arm 46 . The tensioned wire 66 is disposed in a magnetic field and an electrical current is passed through the wire 66 to cause vibration of the wire 66 , the frequency of which varies linearly with the drag force exerted on the drag plate 44 due to the corresponding change in wire 66 tension. Varying frequency of the current provides a digital electrical signal which varies linearly with fluid flow velocity. Embodiments are described enclosing the wire mounting components in a vacuum housing 30 in order to minimize the air damping of the wire vibration, and a mounting arrangement minimizing the effects of temperature variation on the output signal.
