# HEAT PUMP APPARATUS WITH MULTI STAGE COMPRESSOR

## Abstract
A self contained heat pump system comprises mounted with an enclosing housing a fossil fueled engine 6 , a compressor 7 and a heat pump circuit including the compressor and comprising a condenser receiver 10 , an expansion valve 15 and an evaporator 2 . Means 11,27 are provided for circulating water to be heated through the condenser receiver 10 and through heat exchangers 9,8 connected to the engine coolant and the engine exhaust. Air 1 is passed through the evaporator 2 to be cooled thereby after having been drawn through the housing over the exterior of the condenser receiver 10 , the compressor 7 , the engine 6 and the heat exchangers 8,9 in order to absorb excess heat therefrom prior to being cooled in the evaporator. The system is particularly of use for controlling the environment in a glasshouse with humid air being drawn from the glasshouse space and being mixed with fresh air drawn in from the atmosphere in the housing before being passed through the evaporator for extraction of heat there from. The engine speed is continuously variable across a suitable operating range and controlled so as to vary across that range in between compressor loading and unloading steps.
