# Meter removal indicator.

## Abstract
Electricity meter fraud is detected by incorporating a undi rectional cyclometer type register into a meter. The register is actuated each time the meter and cover assembly which is factory sealed is removed from its associated socket by an ac tuating arm assembly which is in contact with the socket. In one embodiment the actuating arm includes a rod which pro trudes through an opening formed in the base of the meter and is biaserd into contact with the socket so that when the meter is removed from the socket the register is actuated. Alterna tively, the actuating arm is connected to a sliding type meter terminal which is actuated upon insertion and or removal of the meter base with respect to the socket. In a further arrange ment, a switch is provided in the base of the meter and is ar ranged to energize a solenoid to actuate the register whenever the meter is removed from its socket. The register can include one or more drums, with the drums each having a plurality of markings provided thereon, such as the digits 0 9, indicative of the position of the drum. Upon the removal of the meter from its socket the register is actuated causing different markings to be displayed. The register drum is designed to rotate in only one direction and jams upon reaching a predetermined position so that the markings originally displayed by the register cannot be brought back into view by a person who has fraudulently re moved the meter from its socket.
