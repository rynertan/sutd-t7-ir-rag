# Apparatus for controlling the position or movement of a member.

## Abstract
Conventionally, such things as flaps on aircraft are con trolled by sending electrical signals from a control consol opera tored by a pilot to servo mechanisms distributed about the air craft. Such signals are subject to interference from electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic disturbances arising outside the aircraft which in extreme cases may result in the pilot losing control of the aircraft. In an attempt to reduce such interference hydraulic valves such as that shown at 13 , which are distributed throughout the aircraft and which control the movement of members such as flap 1, are powered by electromagnetic radiation transmit ted along lines 9 and 9 and produced by lasers 7 and 7 , which are supplied by a common power source 8.

## Description
Aonaratus for controlling the 70position or movement of a member. This invention relates to apparatus for controlling the position of a member. The invention arose when considering problems in the control of valve members in aircraft and industrial control systems. In such applications a valve member may be used to control a mechanical source of energy. For example in aircraft the valve merger may control the flow of hydraulic fluid to move wing flaps. In industrial control systems the valve member may control the flow of air to a pneumatic actuator of a process control valve. Conventionallv such valve members are controlled by sending electrical signals from a control consol. In aircraft such signals are subject to interference from electrical, magnetic or electro magnetic disturbances arising outside the aircraft which in extreme cases may result in the pilot losing control of the aircraft This nroblem is particularly acute when aircraft having non metallic bodies are involved, because a non metallic body cannot be used to shield conductors carrying the afore mentioned signals. In industrial control systems such electrical signals can initiate an explosion of vapours or vases. By emoloying this invention, these problems can be reduced or eliminated. According to the invention there is provided apparatus for controlling the position or movement of a member including means for transmitting energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation along a line and means for using the energy after passage along the line to do mechanical work in moving the member to be controlled. The invention also provides apparatus comprising mechanical devices at different locations, a common power source for the devices at another location and guides for transmitting the power in the form of electromagnetic energy from the common power source to the mechanical devices. By using the invention in an aircraft or an industrial control system various members to be controlled can be supplied with the necessary power along the optical fibres, or other guides or lines for transmittinc electromagnetic radiation, preferably in the optical, infra red or ultra violet regions of the spectrum thereby avoiding the need for electrical conductors carrying electrical power between the control consol and the members to be controlled and avoiding the problems referred to earlier. It may be necessary to use electricity in one region of the apparatus for generating the aforementioned electromagnetic radiation and , in other regions for converting it to mechanical energy.However, any such regions are localised and can therefore be surrounded by suitable electromagnetic shielding or can be suitably protected against fire risks. The line can be detined by a guide such as an optical fibre but such a guide is not essential and the line may simply be a path between a suitable transmitter and receiver. Ways in which the invention may be performed will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention and Figure 2 shows part of Figure 1 in more detail Figure 3 shows another apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention, similar references being used for similar parts and Figure 4 shows yet another apparatus constructed in accordance with the invention. Figure 1 illtrates a control apparatus for operating a flap 1 on the wing of an aircraft whose hody is made principally of non conductive material. An operator uses a control column 2 to aenerate control signals which are representative of the desired position of the flap 1 in an encoder 3, which is aLinear Variable Differential Transformer, such as Schaevitz engineering model OSOER. These control signals are fed via line 4 to comparator 5 where they are compared with signals received from an optical line 6 representing the actual position of the flap 1. The output of comparator 5 represents the difference between the desired position and the actual position of the flap 1 and is used to control a laser 7 driven by a power source 8S, as described below, to vary the average power of its output.In the case of a laser device designed to produce a pulse output this could be done by varying the frequency and or duration and or amplitude of the output pulses with reference to Figure 2, which shows the compara tor 5 in greater detail, the signals representing the actual position of the flap 1 carried on the optical line 6 are applied to an optical to electrical transducer 27. The transducer 27 receivesanumber of optical signals in parallel from the optical line 6, which comprises a number of optical fibres, and converts them into electrical signals. The signals are applied in parallel on a number of lines 27A to a subtractor 28 which subtracts them from the signals on line 4 which are also applied to it giving an error signal on its output line 29.A set number of successive error signals are integrated by an integrator 30 over a predetermined time controlled by a clock not shown .The integrated error signal is then applied to a pulse generator 31, which produces pulses of constant pulse length at a trequency which is Proportional to the applied integrated error signal. The The sulsegenerator 31 controls the drive 32 of the laser 7 and hence, by altering the frequency of its pulse output, varies its output power. Intra red energy from the laser i is transmitted in the form ot pulses at a controlled frequency as described above along an optical line 9 to a region of the aircraft generally indicated by the broken line 10, remote from the power source 8, where the intra red radiation impinges on a solar cell 11, which acts as an electrical generator and converts the intra red radiation into electrical energy. This is then carried along a short conductor 12 and is applied to a coil not shown incorporated as part of a hydraulic valve 13 which is in the immediate vicinity of the solar cell 11. The power carried by the coii this power being derived from the applied energy transmitted along line 9I does mechanical work in moving a valve member in the valve 13 to a desired position and holding it at that position.The hydraulic valve 13 controls the flow ot some hydraulic fluid from a source of pressure, e.g., a pump and accumulator indicated schematically at 14, to a hydraulic amplifier 13A, which also recieves hydraulic fluid from the pressure source 14 via a hydraulic line 1sB. The hydraulic valve and amplifier 13 and 13A may consist of a two staae serwvalve, such as MOOG Inc. Series 72. The fluid from the amolifier 13A passes to a return line 15 containing a constriction indicated schematically at ib. Thus the position of the valve member of valve 13 determines the pressure of fluid in the part ot the return line 15 between valve 13 and constriction 16. This part of the return line 15 is connected to a cvlinder 11 containing a piston 18. The piston has a restoring spring 19 which acts against the force provided by the hydraulic system. The piston 18 is attached to the tlap 1 in such a way that movement of the piston 18 alters the attitude of the flap 1. An optical shaft encoder 20 receives pulses of light ot a fixed pulse frequency from a turther laser 21, via an optical link 22, which is similar to the optical line 6 and comprises a plurality ot optical fibres, and encodes this light so as to produce an optical signal, representing the position of rotation of the flap 1, which it transmits back to the comparator 5 via the optical link 6. The shaft encoder 20 may be a 14 bit fibre optic encoder according to the invention described in the specification of U.S.patent No. 4,302,109. It is to be noted that the only electrical conductors used to control the position of the flap 1 are short conductors, 4,12 and 8A. The conductors 4 and 8A which are in the immediate vicinity of the operator, are enclosed within an earthed protective conductive housing 23 whilst the conductor 12 which is in the immediate vicinity of the valve 13 and solar cell 11, remote from the operator, is enclosed within an earthed fireproof conductive housing 24. These conductors are therefore protected against the effects of externally generated electrical, magnetic or electromagnetic fields and any fire risk arising from current carried by these conductors is confined to the regions within the housing 23 and 24. In addition to the control column 2 a further control 2 is accessible to the operator for controlling some function other than the position of flap 1, e.g.the position of a difterent flap or an under carriage at a location 10 remote both from the operator and from the location 10. This is done using components 3 ,4 ,5 , , and bA enclosed within the housing 23 optical links 6 ,9 , and 22 similar to 6,9, and 22 and components not shown within location 10 similar to those within location 10. It should be noted that the apparatus described above is only one embodiment of the invention and many other variations exist. For example, the devices located at 1U and 10 and powered by the common power source 8 may be electronic in character. They may, for instance, be other control devices or temperature or pressure indicators arranged to generate an output signal and to transmit it along optical fibres like those shown at 6 and 6 . A further possibility is that the device at one location 10 is electronic whilst that at another location lU and powered by the same power source 8 is mechanical. Figure 3 shows another embodiment of the invention intended for use in controlling the flow of fluids in industrial processes. Referring to Figure 3, pulses ot light are transmitted along an optical line 9 to an opto mechanical transducer 25. The light causes the transducer 25 to expand and contract, generating mechanical energy in the form of acoustic vibrations. A suitable transducer is shown in Figure 1 of a paper byDA. Kleinman andD.F. Nelson, J. Acoust. Soc AM. Vol. 59 No.6 June 1976 p. 1484. The transducer 25 is coupled to a fluidic switch and amplitier 26 which is switched on and oft by the mechanical energy to control the passage of air through it to a diaphragm 18A which is mechanicalls coupled to the stem 1A or the valve 1B located in a pipeline 1C carrying a fluid whose flow is to be controlled.The fluidic switch and amplifier 26 can be any bistable device such as described in standard texts on fluid logic e.g. Fluid logic in simple terms , byM.J. Moylan, The Machinerv Publishing Co. 1Y68. The mark to space ratio of the pulses of light controls the proportion ot the time during which the fluidic switch 26 is open and therefore the pressure in the cylinder 17, the position of the diaphragm 1BA and the position of. the valve stem 1A. An optical linear position encoder OA, again constructed according to the invention disclosed in U.S. Pateht No. 4,302,109, co operates with the shatt 1A but otherwise operates in a manner similar to the encoder 20 of Figure 1. In a further embodiment not illustrated of the invention, electromagnetic energy is transmitted along an optical line to a fluid or solid body and causes it to heat and expand, causing a control member to which it is coupled to move. With reference to Figure 4, which shows yet another embodiment of the invention electromagnetic energy transmitted along a line 34 which is similar to that shown at 9 on Figures 1,2 and 3 is modulated so as to carry data generated at the upstream end of the line 34. In this embodiment the data is used to control to POsition of a member 35 which is powered by the electromagnetic energy, but it ma be used for some other purpose. The energy impinges on a solar cell 36 at the down stream end or the line 34 where it is converted into electrical form. This electrical power is applied to a decoder 37 and switch 38 is parallel. The data carried by the electromagnetic energy is extracted and decoded bv the decoder 37 and gives the desired position of the member 35. The decoded data is applied to a comparator 39 as is information from a position encoder 40 which is related to the actualDosition of the member 35. The comparator 39 generates a control signal which is anolied to the switch 38 via a line 41 and which is denendant on the difference between the actual and desired positions of the member 35. 5 7hen there is a difference the control signal onerates the switch 38 so as to allow power to be transmitted from the solar cell 36 to a motor 42 which moves the member 35. When the member 35 is at its desired position as determined by the data the stitch 38 isolates the motor 42 from the power from the solar cell 36. In this embodiment no feedback path like that shown at 6 and 22 in Figures 1 to 3 is needed.
