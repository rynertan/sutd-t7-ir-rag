## Abstract
A chisel 10 is characterised by having a replaceable blade 13 releasably clamped to its shaft 12 by a springy elongate member 14 pivoted to the shaft 12 at 15, closely ad jacent the blade 13, so that the front end 14a of member 14 bears down upon the blade 13 to clamp it to the shaft 12. The rear end 14b of springy member 14 is releasably located in a recess 11a at the front end of handle 11. The blade 13 is lo cated by a spigot 12a of shaft 12 locating in a hole 13a in blade 13, and by the pivot 15 locating in a notch 13b at the rear end of blade 13. Advantageously, the blades may be a number of different widths 13f to 13k.

## Description
A CHISEL This invention relates to a chisel comprising a handle, a metal shaft projecting forwardly of the handle and a chisel blade on the front end of the shaft. Such a chisel is well known for use in chiselling wood and similar material. According to the invention, the chisel is characterised in that the blade is releasably clamped to the shaft so as to be replaceable. The invention will be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, wherein Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are respectively a front elevation, a side elevation and a rear elevation of a chisel embodying the invention Fig. 4 corresponds to Fig. 1, but with a removeable spare blade holder removed from the handle Fig. 5 is a section on line V V of Fig. 4 Fig. 6 is a section on line VI VI of Fig. 1 Fig. 7 illustrates the spare blade holder alone, containing two spare replacement blades Fig. 8 is an enlarged section on line VIII VIII ofFig. 1 Fig. 9 is a partial illustration of the front end of the chisel, with the clamping member omitted Fig. 10 illustrates the chisel being held in the left hand, with the clamping member pivoted aside, and a blade being inserted or withdrawn by the right hand Fig. 11 illustrates a strip of blades for the chisel and Fig. 12 illustrates a number of alternative blades for the chisel. Referring to the drawings, the illustrated chisel 10 comprises a handle 11, a metal shaft 12 projecting forwardly of the handle 11 and a chisel blade 13 on the front end of the shaft 12. The chisel blade 13 is releasably clamped to the shaft 12 so as to be replaceable. The blade 13 is releasably clamped to the shaft 12 by an elongate springy member 14 which extends along the shaft 12, being pivotably connected to the shaft 12 by a pivot connection 15 closedly adjacent the blade 13, the pivot 15 taking the form of a rivet, as shown most clearly in Fig. 8. The springiness of the member 14 is such that its front end 14a bears down strongly upon the blade 13 to clamp the blade 13 to the shaft 12, whilst the rear end 14b is biased downwardly into a recess 11a in handle 11.To release the blade 13, the rear end 14b of member 14 is lifted out of the recess lla and member 14 is then pivoted about the pivot 15, as shown in Fig. 10. The blade 13 is located on the shaft 12 by a spigot 12a of shaft 12 locating in a hole 13a in the blade 13, and by the pivot 15 locating in a notch 13b at the rear end of the blade 13, as well as the downward pressure of the front end 14a of member 14 when in its normal position as shown in Figs. 1 to 5 and 8. The handle ill has a cavity llb into which a spare blade holder 16 is releasably clipped by virtue of a small projection llc at the rear end of cavity llb locating in a recess 16a of the blade holder 16 and an integral spring arm 16b of blade holder 16 engaging the front end wall Ild of cavity llb of handle 11. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the blade holder 16 can hold a number of blades 13c, 13d, for example, of different sizes. One side 16c of the holder 16 is enlarged and seats correspondingly in the handle 11 as shown, so that the holder 16 can only be inserted in the handle 11 one way round as shown. Fig. 11 shows a strip of blades 13e, all of the same size, with waste material between each pair of adjacent blades, whilst Fig. 12 shows six blades 13f to 13k of progressively increasing widths. The chisel 10 can of course be used by anybody, and affords the advantage of the blade being replaceable either when it gets blunt or a different width blade is required, or it is desired to remove the blade during non use for safety or convenience. It is believed that the do it yourself 11 handyman in particular will find the chisel 10 useful.
