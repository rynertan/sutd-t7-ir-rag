# Fabrication of panels, binders, trays, frames, boxes and other assemblies from sheet material and channel shaped edging strips.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the fabrication of panels, trays and other assemblies from fibreboard or other sheet material by folding back edge portions 1a,1b of the sheet 1 to pro vide marginal portions of increased thickness and substan tially uniform width of which the inner edges define retaining abutments, each marginal portion being located in a channel of respective channel shaped edging strips 4a, 4b each hav ing a lip or rib 5 which engages over and with the retaining abutment of the marginal portion to resist separation of the strip from the edge of the sheet in the direction perpendicular to said edge. The edging strips are assembled to an edge by forcing the channel over the marginal portion. Adjacent edg ing strips engage to resist sliding movement.
