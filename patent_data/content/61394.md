# Thigh support adjusting mechanism for vehicle seat.

## Abstract
An adjustable thigh support 52 for an automotive vehicle seat 20, 22 wherein the tilting angle may be adjusted with reduced operational force. The adjusting mechanism comprises a rotatable shaft co operating with a manually operative lever and lever structure for lifting up the thigh support in response to rotation of the rotatable shaft. The lever structure includes a member converting the rotational force applied to the rotatable shaft into a substantially horizontal reciprocating force and a member for converting the horizontal reciprocat ing force into a substantially vertical reciprocating force. The vertical force is applied to the thigh support 52 for lifting up the latter. The member converting the horizontal force to a vertical force is associated with a means for receiving and absorbing a vertical downwards force working as a reacting force against the operational force. The invention is applicable to a driver s seat.
