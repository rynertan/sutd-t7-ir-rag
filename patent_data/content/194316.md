## Description
This invention relates to an NC data creation method and, more particularly, to an NC data creation method for creating NC data by using a tablet device. There is an NC data creation apparatus in which points or figures on a drawing placed upon a tablet surface are inputted by a tablet device and the input data are used to create NC data. An example of such an apparatus is disclosed in EP A 0087948. With such an apparatus, NC data are created in the following manner. As shown in Fig. 6, assume that a tool is to be moved from a reference point P The drawing depicting the part profile is placed on the tablet surface of the tablet device. Under these conditions, a Starting Point Designation area of a menu affixed to the tablet surface is designated, after which the positional coordinate values of the point P₁₀₀ are entered by using a coordinate designator. This creates NC data Next, creation of absolute data is declared by designating an Absolute area on the menu, a Positioning area is designated and then positional coordinate values of the machining starting point P₁ are entered by the coordinate designator. This creates positioning data Thereafter, a Keyboard area on the menu is designated end the following NC data for approach are entered from a keyboard After the NC data for moving the tool along the machining path S₁ S₂ S₃ S₄ are created, the Keyboard area on the menu is designated and the following NC data for retraction are entered from the keyboard It will be understood from the foregoing that the tablet device enables the positional coordinate values of points to be entered by designating the points using a coordinate designator, and enables a graphic to be entered by moving the coordinate designator along the graphic. However, the points and graphics which can be entered are points and graphics on a predetermined plane XY plane positions along the Z axis cannot be entered. Consequently, NC data for specifying tool movement along the Z axis, e.g. NC data for approach and NC data for retraction, cannot be generated automatically by the tablet device, so that these items of data must be entered one at a time from the keyboard. The operation for entering approach or retraction NC data from the keyboard is troublesome. In addition, if a large number of approach and retraction motions are necessary for machining a single part, to some extent approach and retraction NC data must entered each time, thereby complicating operation even further. Accordingly, the time required for NC data creation is prolonged and data input errors readily occur. An object of the present invention is to provide an NC data creation method through which NC data inclusive of motion along the Z axis, such an approach NC data and retraction NC data, can be created without manipulating a keyboard once the data have been registered. According to the present invention there is provided an NC data creation method in which a prescribed area of a menu fixed to a tablet surface of a tablet device is designated by using a coordinate designator, thereby specifying whether data such as rapid traverse data, linear cutting data and circular arc cutting data are to be created, turning on a switch mounted on the coordinate designator to enter coordinate values of points on a drawing designated by the coordinate designator, creating prescribed NC data for any of rapid traverse, linear cutting and circular arc cutting by using said entered coordinate values, and registering a plurality of macros in advance for creating different sets of NC data, characterised by For example, to specify a machining path after the creation of NC data for positioning, a point sequence input mode is selected, points on a drawing are designated by the coordinate designator and a switch for a point sequence input is turned from off to on, whereupon a predetermined macro including NC data for approach is called and appended to the end of NC data created by the operations performed thus far. If the point sequence input switch is turned from on to off after the machining path is specified, a macro inclusive of NC data for retraction is called and appended to the end of NC data created thus far. The use of previously stored macros is known in the art. Thus see for example EP A 0092977, which employs macros for other purposes. Fig. 2 is an external view of an NC data creation apparatus having a tablet. In the Figure, numeral 11 denotes the main body of the apparatus, 12 a keyboard having a number of keys, 13 a graphic display unit, 14 a cassette magnetic tape device or a floppy disc unit , 15 a printer, 16 a paper tape reader puncher, and 17 a tablet device. The apparatus main body 11 has a control unit, not shown, constituted by a microcomputer which executes processing for input output, for digitizing and for the creation of NC data, by means of the tablet 17 on the basis of a system program stored previously in a RAM, as will be set forth later. The keyboard 12 has a number of keys and is used for designating jobs through a conversational operation, for designating system program loading, for entering NC data, etc. The graphic display 13 displays input graphics, input data, coordinate values, NC data and various messages needed for conversational operation. The cassette magnetic tape 14 is used to enter the system program, which is stored on a cassette tape not shown , into the RAM of the apparatus main body 11. By way of example, when using the tablet device to enter coordinate, values directly from a drawing and to create NC data, the system program for digitizing processing, which is contained in the cassette magnetic tape, must be fed into the RAM of the apparatus main body. The printer 15 prints out characters which appear on the screen of the graphic display unit 13, the contents punched in a paper tape, and information which has been written into the magnetic tape. The paper tape reader puncher 16 creates an NC tape by punching a paper tape with the prepared NC data, or reads NC or other data which have already been punched into an NC tape. By relying upon a cursor 17b, the tablet device 17 inputs positions on a drawing, which is laid on the tablet surface 17a, into the apparatus main body 11. The tablet device 17 also enters information necessary for NC data creation in response to designation of a predetermined area on a menu 17c affixed to the tablet surface 17a. Fig. 3 is an enlarged view off the cursor 17b, which has a cursor body CSB, first and second switches SW1, SW2, a reading focal point RFP, a connector CNT and a cable CBL. To enter coordinates, the intersection Pc of the cross hairs provided on the reading focal point RFP is aligned with a point on a drawing that is desired to be entered, followed by depressing the first switch SW1 or second switch SW2. The tablet device 17 has the capability of recognizing the positions of points designated on the tablet surface. Accordingly, the tablet device 13 can be provided with an item input function if a portion of the tablet surface is divided into a plurality of areas and each area is assigned an item name. The menu 17c shown in Fig. 4 is affixed to the tablet surface 17a and 1 NC data for rapid traverse positioning , 2 NC data for linear cutting, and 3 NC data for circular arc cutting can be created by designating areas a₁ a₁₆ on the menu or by using designated point data. Specifically, the menu 17c is divided into areas of from a₁ to a₁₆, and the areas are designated in the following cases Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an NC data creating apparatus to which the present invention is applied, and Fig. 5 is a flowchart of processing. In Fig. 1, portions similar to those shown in Fig. 2 are designated by like reference characters. Numeral 11a denotes a processor, 11b a ROM, 11c a RAM, and 11d a working memory. If NC data specifying the tool path shown in Fig. 6 are to be created, then The first micro MCR1 is The condition for calling the second micro MCR2 is that switch SW1 be turned from on to off after the area a₁₅ of the menu 17c is designated. A method of creating NC data according to the present invention will now be described with reference to the flowchart of Fig. 5. Thereafter, the foregoing processing is repeated to eventually complete the creation of the desired NC data. Let us now describe a specific case in which NC data along the path shown in Fig. 6 are created. According to the present invention as described above, a plurality of macros specifying motion e.g. approach motion and retraction motion along an axis Z axis which does not enable an input with a tablet are registered in advance, a predetermined macro is called by manipulating a switch for point entry, and NC data for approach and for retraction are created by using the macro. It is therefore unnecessary to enter NC data for approach and for retraction from a keyboard item by item, thereby simplifying the NC data creation operation, shortening the NC data creation time and eliminating data input errors. The invention is particularly effective in cases where identical approach and retraction motions are repeated a number of times to machine a single part. Though the foregoing description deals with a case where the invention is applied to milling machining, the invention can also be applied to machining such as drilling. In such case, a macro having NC data for drilling is registered in advance, a prescribed area is designated and a prescribed switch is turned on to create positioning data, the macro is called and drilling NC data are placed after these positioning NC data to create a drilling program. Further, the foregoing description relates to a case where a predetermined macro is called by turning a single switch on or off. However, it is of course permissible to provide two or more switches, register a number of macros and call a prescribed micro based on whether each of the switches is on or off.
