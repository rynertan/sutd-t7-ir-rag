# Pouch forming and filling mechanism with provision for increasing the capacity of the pouches.

## Abstract
Pouching apparatus for increasing the volume of ma terial packed into a pouch. The apparatus includes a filler wheel assembly. means for rotating said assembly, a vacu um transfer wheel mounted below said filler wheel assembly and rotatable therewith, a plurality of vertical lands circum ferentially spaced around said transfer wheel to receive a web of pouches, means for applying vacuum to said lands, a plurality of tuck fingers movably mounted on the transfer wheel between said lands, a stationary, circumferential cam mounted adjacent said transfer wheel to raise said tuck fingers to form an upward tuck in the bottom of each pouch of said web thereby increasing its capacity. The apparatus also includes clips to hold the web on the lands of the trans fer wheel. The apparatus also includes a feed roll which feeds said web onto said transfer wheel at a preselected speed somewhat greater than the speed of said transfer wheel to force pouches into the space between said lands. The apparatus further includes means providing one or more jets of air to open the pouches prior to filling.
