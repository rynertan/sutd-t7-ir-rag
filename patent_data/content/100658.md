# LABELLING TAPES

## Abstract
A labelling tape consists of a plastics film 2 and adhesive 3 to stick it to the object it is desired to label, which adhesive 3 is protected by a release paper strip 1 . In the labelling tape a narrower pigmented tape comprising a plastics film backing 6 and a shearable dyed or pigmented coating 7 is held against the surface of tape 2 . The pigmented tape is held against the tape 2 e.g. by an overall applied wider adhesive tape 4, 5 . In use pigmented or dyed areas corresponding to the desired label legend are transfer red from coating 7 to the surface of tape 2 under pressure. Thereafter the remainder of the pigmented tape is peeled off and discarded to leave the transferred pigmented or dyed legend on plastics film 2 and, preferably beforehand, the release paper strip 1 is removed and plastics film 2 is adhered to the object to be labelled. A modified tape embossing machine may be used to make the labels.
