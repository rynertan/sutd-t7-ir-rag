## Description
POWDERY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION SUITABLE FOR APPLICATION TO MUCOSA OF ORAL OR NASAL CAVITY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a powdery pharmaceutical composition suitable for application to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity. More specifically, it relates to a powdery pharmaceutical composition, suitable for application to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, containing a lower alkyl ethers of cellulose as a base, b a steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agent as a drug component, and c a solid low irritant organic acid as a stabilizer for the drug component. The powdery pharmaceutical composition exhibits extremely excellent stability in the steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agent contained therein, low irritation of the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, and sustained release of the drug over an extended period of time. Accordingly, the powdery pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be effectively used for the treatment of oral diseases such as stomatitis, erosion or sores generated by radiotherapy, and licken planus or nasal diseases such as allergic rhinitis and vasomotor rhinitis. 2. Description of the Related Art Various pharmaceutical preparations, such as buccal tablets, troche tablets, sublingual tablets, and oral ointments, have been heretofore known in the art for application to the oral cavity. Buccal tablets, troche tablets, and sublingual tablets, however, give a foreign feeling to the oral cavity. Therefore, patients often chew on and swallow the tablets. Oral ointments, on the other hand, usually contain mixtures of beeswax or plastibase with gelatin, pectin, or sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose. These mixtures are unsatisfactory because the adhesion properties thereof to the oral mucosa are not sufficient and also because they have unpleasant tastes. On the other hand, various pharmaceutical preparations, such as nasal ointments, jellies, nose drops, and sprays, have been known in the art for application to the nasal cavity. Nasal ointments and jellies, however, are difficult to apply to deep parts of the nasal cavity, such as the concha nasalis superior.With, nose drops and sprays, the active components do not remain in the nasal cavity for an extended period of time. Various sustained release pharmaceutical preparations for oral or nasal cavity administration are known in the art. With these, the efficacy of the drugs is spread over a long period of time by the gradual or sustained releasing the active drug components from the pharmaceutical preparations For example, JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 55 118511 discloses powdery sustained release preparations suitable for adhesion to the oral cavity. These preparations use, as a base, hydroxypropyl cellulose and have the advantages of an excellent sustained release of the drugs and possible application over a wide range of the oral cavity. Furthermore, U.S. Patent No. 4,294,829 discloses powdery sustained release preparations suitable for application to the nasal cavity.These contain lower alkyl ethers of cellulose and drugs and also have the advantage of excellent sustained release of the drugs. It is, however, more desirable to improve the stability of drugs in the above mentioned sustained release preparations for application to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity. SUM 5SRY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition, suitable for application to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, having extremely excellent stability of the carried drug, i.e., a steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agent. Another object of the present invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceuticalcornposition, suitable for application to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, containing a lower alkyl ether of cellulose as a base, a steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type antiinflammatory agent as a drug, and a specific solid low irritant organic acid as a stabilizer for the drug. A further object of the present invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition having low irritation of the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical composition having excellent sustained release of the drug. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a powdery pharmaceutical compositior. having a particle diameter suitable for administration to the oral or nasal cavity. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing a powdery pharmaceutical composition suitable for application to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity. A still further objects of the present invention is to provide a method for stabilizing a powdery pharmaceutical composition containing a steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agent as a drug. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. According to the present invention, the above mentioned objects and advantages can be achieved by a powdery pharmaceutical composition including a a base selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl ethers of cellulose b a pharmaceutically effective amount of a drug selected from the group consisting of steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agents and c a stabilizer for the drug composed of at least one low irritant solid organic acid selected from the group consisting of saturated higher aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having 12 or more carbon atoms, aliphatic polycarboxylic acids, hydroxy aliphatic polycarboxylic acids, aromatic carboxylic acids, unsaturated lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having six or less carbon atoms, and cellulose derivatives having carboxyl groups. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS According to the present invention, the desired powdery pharmaceutical composition, i.e., a composition having extremely excellent stability of the drug, low irritation to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, and excellent sustained release of the drug, can be obtained by using a lower alkyl ether of cellulose as a base, a steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti infla matcry agent as a drug, and a specific solid low irritant organic acid as a stabilizer for the drug, i.e., by combining the specified base and the specified drug with the specified organic acid. The lower alkyl ethers of cellulose usable as a base in the present invention are those obtained by at least partially substituting the same or different lower alkyl ether groups for a plurality of hydroxyl groups of cellulose. The lower alkyl groups in the lower alkyl ether groups may be substituted with substituents. F n example of such preferable substituents is a hydroxyl group. Preferable examples of the optionally substituted lower alkyl groups are a methyl group, and hydroxy lower alkyl groups having 2 or 3 carbon atoms. Examples of the optionally substituted lower alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, 6 kydroxyethyl, and a hydroxypropyl. Examples of the optionally substituted lower alkyl ethers of cellulose are methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Of these lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, the use of methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose is preferable due to the facts that these lower alkyl ethers of cellulose have substantially no odor and irritation when applied to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, which is particularly sensitive to odor and irritation, and that the desired sustained release of the drug can be obtained. Of these lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, the use of hydroxypropyl cellulose is especially preferable. The lower alkyl ethers of cellulose can be used alone or in any mixture thereof. When the above mentioned lower alkyl ethers of cellulose are used as a base in the powdery pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, the pharmaceutical preparations thus obtained can adhere to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity and will swell to gradually release te active drug components terefre over a long period of te. Thus, the a,zeczed or diseased parts can be treated by the drugs over a long period of time. Although there is no limitation in the molecular weight of the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose usable in the present invention, lower alkyl ethers having a viscosity in 2 aqueous solution thereof of 3 to 10,000 cps at 370C 0.20C, more preferably, 1000 to 4000 cps at 37 C 0.2 C, are preferably used. In preparing unit dosage forms of powdery pharmaceutical compositions in which lower alkyl ethers of cellulose are contained as z base, the compositions are generally filled in hard capsules. These capsules are set in a specially designed spraying device. The spraying device is provided with needle for spraying the powdery pharmaceutical corpositions into the oral or nasal cavity. In this case, when the moisture content of the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose in the capsules is too small, the moisture contained in the me.O ar.es cf the capsules tends to be absorbed by the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose and, as a result, the capsules become too rigid.Therefore, lower alkyl ethers of cellulose having a moisture content of 3 to 98 by weight, especially 4 to 8 by weight, are preferably used as a base. The drugs usable in the present powdery pharmaceutical compositions are steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agents. Examples of such steroid type anti inflammatory agents are beclomethascne dipropionate, betamethascne, betamethasone valerate, triamcinolone, triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone, fluocinolone acetonide, fluocinonide, flurnethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, and prednisone. Examples of glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agents are glycrrizic acid, disodium glycyrrhizinate, trisodium glycyrrhizinate, monopotassium glycyrrhizinate, dipo tassium glycyrrhizinate and monoammonium glycyrrhizinate.These drugs can be used alone or in any mixture thereof in the present powdery pharmaceutical composition. According te the present invention, the above mentioned anti inflammatory agents contained in te powdery pharmaceutical compositions comprising the above mentioned lower alkyl ethers of cellulose as a base can be advantageously stabilized by incorporating thereinto, as a stabilizer, a specified organic acid, i.e., at least one solid low irritant organic acid selected from the group consisting of saturated higher aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having 12 or rncre carbon atoms, aliphatic polycarboxylic acids, hydrox aliphatic pclycarboxylic acids, aromatic carboxylic acids, unsaturated lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having six or less carbon atoms, and cellulose derivatives having carboxyl groups. The organic acids usable as a stabilizer for the drug in the present invention are those selected from the above mentioned group of the organic acids which are sclid at room temperature, less irritant to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity, and substantially odorless or with only a very slight odor. By the term organic acids is meant acids comprising organic groups and free carboxylic groups. Use of the organic acids solid at room temperature facilitates the production of the desired powdery pharmaceutical compositions in a uniform particle size. Use of the less irritant organic acids means higher safety when the composition is applied to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity. Examples of the preferable saturated higher aliphatic monocarboxylic acids are saturated higher aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acid having 12 to 24 carbon atoms, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, and myristic acid. Examples of the prefer able aliphatic polycarboxylic acids are aliphatic hydrocarbon dicarboxylic acids having 4 to 6 carbon a zs, such as, scenic acid, fumaric acid, and maleic acid. Examples of the preferable hydroxy aliptic polycarboxylic acid are hydroxy aliphatic hydrocarbon di or tri carboxylic acids having 4 to 8 carbon atoms, such as, tartaric acid and citric acid. Examples of the preferably aromatic acids are benzoic acid and its cer vatives, such as parahydroxy benzoic acid and salicylic acid. Examples of the preferable unsaturated lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acids are unsaturated lower aliphatic hydrocarbon monocarboxylic acid having 4 to 6 carbon atoms, such as sorbic acid. Examples of t.ke preferable cellulose derivatives having carboxyl groups are carboxymethyl cellulose and car xymethylethyl cellulose. These organic acids can be used alone or in any mixture thereof. Of the above mentioned organic acids, saturated higher aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having 12 or more carbon atoms, aliphatic polycarboxylic acids, hydroxy aliphatic polycarboxlic acids, aromatic carboxylic acids, and cellulose derivatives having carboxyl groups are preferably used. For powdery pharmaceutical compositions for application to the nasal cavity, use of saturated higher aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having 12 or more carbon atoms and cellulose derivatives having carboxyl groups is especially preferably from the viewpoints of low irritation and substantial odorlessness. There is no specific limitation in the amount of the above mentioned organic acids in the present phar.a ceutical composition as long as the anti inflammatory agents are stabilized. The preferable amount of the organic acid in the present pharmaceutical composition is within the range of from 0.05 to 5 by weight, especially from 0.18 to 3 by weight, based upon the total weight of the composition.Although there is also no critical limitation in the particle size of the organic acid, the organic acid preferably has such a particle size that at least about 90 by weight of the powder particles has an effective particle diameter c about 75 um or less, more preferably about 20 um to about 75 m, to obtain a powdery phartaceutical c position capable of being effectively administered to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity. As mentioned above, the powdery pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention contain, as essential constituents, the above mentioned lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type anti inflammatory agents, and organic acid stabilizers.Although there is no specific imitation is the particle size of the present pharmacertic l corposition, the particle size of the preset pharra cetical composition is preferably such that at least but 90 by weigr.t of the powder particles thereof has a effective particle diameter of about 2 i urn te abct 250 m.The Present powdery pharmaceutical compositIon having such a particle size distribution is preferably due to the fact that the amount of the powder particles adhering to the mucosa of the oral or nasal cavity becomes large. That is, when the pharmaceutical composition having the above mentioned preferable particle size distribution is applied to the oral or nasal cavity, the amount of the pharmaceutical composition reaching, for example, the lung becomes small or the amount of the pharmaceutical composition scattered out of the oral or nasal cavity becomes small. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition having the above mentioned preferable particle size can well adhere to the mucosa of the oral cr nasal cavity and can be effectively and gradually released.The powdery pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention more preferably has such a particle size distribution that at least about 90 by weight of the powder particles has an effective particle diameter of about 20 pm to about 150 um. The term effective particle diameter used herein means that determined bthe opening sizes of sieves.For example, a powder having an effective diameter d of 37 c 44 passes through 2 sieve having an opening size of 44 microns but does not pass through a sieve having an opening size of 37 microns. A vibratory sieve is used when the effective particle diameter of a powder is more than 37 microns, and a sonic sieve Micro Hand Sifter SWM 2, a product of Tsutsui Rikagaku Kikai Co., Ltd. is used when the effective particle diameter of a powder is not more than 37 microns. The sieves used has an opening size of 500, 420, 350, 297, 250, 210, 177, 149, 125, 105, 88, 74, 63, 53, 4t, 3, 25, and 20 microns, respectively. The powdery pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can optionally contain, in addition to the above mentioned lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, anti inflammatory agents, and organic acids, any conen tional ingredients for improving the physical properties, visual appearance, or odor of the pharmaceutical preparations. Examples of such ingredients are lubricants such as talc and waxes binders such as starch, dextrin, tragacanth gum, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinyl alcohol diluents such as starch, crystalline cellulose, dextrin, lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, and anhydrous calcium phosphate odor improvers such as menthol and citrus perfumes preservatives such as methyl p hydroxybenzoate, propyl p hydroxybenzoate and various surfactants. The powdery pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be prepared in any conventional manner. For example, the pharmaceutical composition can be prepared by mechanically mixing the above mentioned three essential constituents, i.e., the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, the anti inflammatory agents, and the solid organic acids and the above mentioned optional ingredients, if any. The mixing of the composition can be carried out by using any conventional means such as ball mills, and V type mixers. The desired pharmaceutical composition can also be prepared by mechanically mixing all the above mentioned constituents of the composition, compressing the resultant mixture under pressure, e.g., 0.2 to 0.4 ton, to and pulverizing the compressed mixture so as to obtain the desired particle size distribution. The mixed or pulverized powder particles can be sieved to obtain the powdery composition having the desired particle size distribution, if necessary. The desired pharmaceutical composition can further be prepared by impregnating the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose with a solution or dispersion, in an organic solvent e.g., methanol, ethanol, ethyl cellosolve, and dichloromethane , of the anti inflammatory agents and te organic acids and, if any, the optional ingredients, followed by drying the impregnated product. The said organic solvent may contain water. The impregnation can be carried out by, for example, spraying the abovementioned solution or dispersion to the lower all ethers of cellulose in the form of powder particles in a spray apparatus. The particle size distribution of the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose can be controlled to the desired range prior to the impregnation.Alternatively, the powder particles of the impregnated product can be pulverized and or sieved after the impregnation so as to obtain the desired particle size distribution. Furthermore, the desired pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose, the anti inflammatory agents, the solid organic acid, and any optional ingredients in organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl cellosolve, and dichloromethane, water, or the mixture thereof followed by evaporating the organic solvents off. The resultant composition can be pulverized anchor sieved to obtain the desired particle size distribution. According.to the present inventicn, a powdery 0 preparation in a unit dosage form including the above mentioned powdery pharmaceutical composition can be obtained. The present pharmaceutical composition can be directly converted to the powdery preparation in the form of a unit dosage. The unit dosage of the powdery preparations according to the present invention is preferably about 10 mg to about 400 mg, especially about 30 mg to about 300 mg, when applied to the oral cavity and about 5 mg to about 200 mg, especially about 10 mg to about 100 mg, when applied to the nasal cavity. The amount of the steroid or glycyrrhizic acid type arti inflam .,atory agent in the powdery preparation in the unit dosage form depends upon the pharmaceutical lv effective amount of the anti inflammatory agent te be used and the number of dosages of the preparation.For example, when beclomethasone dipropionate is inccrpcrated into the powdery preparations for application to the nasal or oral cavity, the appropriate amount is about 25 to 200 ug day, although the conventional amount is about 200 to 400 ug day. When dipotassium glycyrrhizinate is incorporated into the powdery preparations for appli cation to the oral cavity, the appropriate amount is about 0.1 to 15 mg day, although the conventional amount is about 10 to 30 mg day. This is because, since lower alkyl ethers of cellulose are used in the present pharmaceutical composition, a desired sustained release of the drug component can be obtained. The powdery preparations cf the present invention can be preferably filled into capsules, such as hard gelatin capsules, as a preferred dosage form. The present powdery preparations can be advantageously applied to the oral or nasal cavity. For example, a capsule filled with the present powdery preparation is set in a spraying device esuireed with a needle. The capsule is pierced with the needle to provide minute holes on the tcF and bottom sides. The powdery preparation is then sprayed or jetted out from the capsule by sending air into the capsule by means of, for example, a rubber ball. As mentioned above, when the moisture content in the powdery preparation filled in a hard gelatin capsule is too small, the powdery preparation absorbs moisture from the gelatine membrane. Therefore, water is preferably contained in an amount of 3 to 8.58 by weight, especially 4E to 8.58 by weight, in the lower alkyl ethers of cellulose in the powdery preparations. The powdery preparations according to the present invention can be widely used or the treatment of oral diseases such as stomatitis, erosion or sores generated by radiotherapy, and lichen. Flanks or nasal diseases such as allergic rhinitis and vascmetor rhinitis. EXXMPT E The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to, but is by no means limited to, the following examples, wherein all percentages and parts are on the weight basis unless otherwise specified. Example 1 A 100 part amount of hydroxypropyl cellulose having a viscosity of a 2 aqueous solution thereof of 1550 cps at 370C 0.20C and having a particle size such that 90 or more of the powder particles had a particle diameter of 37 to 149 um was used. One part of the hydroxypropyl cellulose and 0.025 parts of beclomethasone dipropionate were thoroughly mixed in a mortar and, then, 9 parts of hydroxypropyl cellulose was gradually added thereto. The resultant mixture was thoroughly mixed and, then, the remaining hydroxypropyl cellulose were added and thoroughly mixed in a mixer. Thereafter, 0.5 parts of stearic acid was added and thoroughly mixed. Thus, a powdery composition for the application to the oral cavity containing beclomethasone dipropionate uniformly dispersed therein was prepared. The powdery composition was filled in t2 hard gelatin capsules in an .lount of 200 m each to prepare a powdery preparation in a unit dosage for m for the application to the oral cavity.
