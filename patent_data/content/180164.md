# METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF LYSOZYME ENZYME

## Abstract
The application is concerned with a method for the prep aration of lysozyme enzyme and its salts form an egg white solution with a pH value of 6 to 8 by binding lysozyme on a weak acidic cation exchanger, separating the cation exchanger from the protein solution, washing the cation exchanger, elut ing lysozyme from the cation exchanger and crystallizing lyso zyme from the eluate as free base or as its acid addition salt and optionally regenerating the cation exchanger, in which as a weak acidic cation exchanger a weak acidic cation exchanger gel amidated on its surface and smaller in pore diameter than an average exclusion molecular weight of 25,000, there is used for the washing of the gel an aqueous alkali halide solution containing up to 1 w v of an alkali halide, and the elution of the enzyme is carried out with a 4 to 15 w v aqueous alkali halide solution.
