# Vibrator thermal stress differential compensator.

## Abstract
A stress compensator 26 that absorbs thermal dimensional changes between major structural components made of dissimilar materials. The stress compensator 26 consists of a hydraulic clamp 30 wedged between the free end of a vibrator actuator piston shaft 22 and the supporting housing 32. Actuated by the substantially constant system hydraulic pressure Ps, the hydraulic clamp 30 maintains a substantially constant clamping force Ps between the actuator piston shaft 22 and the supporting housing. Thermally induced stresses are absorbed by the hydraulic system 76.
