# Variable level converter.

## Abstract
A variable level converter comprises a first variable level converting unit 110 , a second variable level converting unit 120 and a grounded emitter amplifying transistor 13 con nected between them. Each of the first and second variable level converting units is comprised of an inverted L type var iable attenuator which includes a series resistor 111,121 and a variable impedance element 112,122 . The second var iable level converting unit includes the collector resistor 13 of the transistor circuit. Each variable impedance element is controlled by the same level control signal Sc and has the same electric characteristics.
