# Machine for binding books and punching paper.

## Abstract
Apparatus for binding together apertured sheets 21 uses a first strip 24 , a plurality of thermoplastic studs 23 projecting from and spaced longitudinally along the first strip, and a second strip 26 formed with holes spaced longitudi nally of the second strip at intervals complementary to the studs. The apparatus has a frame having a pair of spaced sides 33 and a platen 86 to support the sheets with their aper tures aligned with the holes of the second strip and with the first strip above the sheets with the studs extending through the apertures in the sheets and the holes in the second strip and protruding below the second strip, a pressure bar 106 , cooperating means 108, 109 on the sides and bar for guiding movement of the bar from a first position above the platen to a second position adjacent the platen and resting on top of the first strip, actuating means for moving the pressure bar, a motor 116 for driving the actuating means, and a switch 113 for energising the motor. The characterising feature of the apparatus is that the switch is mounted on the bottom edge of the pressure bar and is positioned and arranged to be closed when the pressure bar rests on the first strip so to energise the motor and begin the binding cycle.
