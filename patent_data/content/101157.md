## Abstract
An aerosol valve 3 for dispensing metered fluid doses from an aerosol container, comprising a valve body 4 at least partially defining a metering chamber 9 and a valve stem 6 operably movable between inoperative and opera tive positions against a bias, the stem 6 having a seal 16 mounted thereon and arranged to seal an inlet duct 18 of the metering chamber 9 when the valve stem 6 is in its operative position. In a preferred embodiment, the valve stem 6 has first and second portions 7, 8 with the seal 16 mounted upon the second portion 8 . In this particular arrangement, and when the valve stem 6 is in its inopera tive position, an outlet duct 12 associated with the metering chamber 9 is sealed therefrom and the inlet duct 18 is open, whereby fluid to be dispensed in a metered dose can flow or be drawn into the metering chamber 9 . When the valve stem 6 is in its operative position, the seal 16 is in sealing engagement with the inlet duct 18 and the outlet duct 12 , of the first stem portion 7 , is in communication with the metering chamber 9 , whereby a metered dose of fluid can be dispensed therefrom.
