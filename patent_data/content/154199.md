# A COAXIAL CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A make before break switch arrangement 36, 48, 46, 60 90, 94, 110, 100 and a circuit element 72 106 are disposed in a connector shell 22,82 , the shell having an electrically conductive contact 60,100 and being adapted to couple to a coaxial cable 10 having a shield conductor 16 and center conductor 12 whereby when disconnected from a compati ble connector 20 80A , an electrical signal passes through a first circuit path comprising the shield conductor, the circuit element, the contact and the center conductor, but when connected to the compatible connector, the electrical circuit path does not include the circuit element.
