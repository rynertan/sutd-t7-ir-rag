# A DEVICE FOR A RETREADING PLANT OF THE TYPE HAVING INDIVIDUAL VULCANIZATION CHAMBERS OF THE PRESS MOLD TYPE

## Abstract
A device for a retreading plant is suggested, wherein tyres prepared for retreading and comprising a carcass or a casing and a tread band applied thereupon will be vulcanized by the aid of heat and pressure. The retreading plant comprises a number of individual vulcanization chambers 13 of the press mold type. The process heat and pressure which is let out at the end of the vulcanization process is led via a conduit 16 into a preheating compartment 12 wherein not yet vulcanized tyres 10 are stored, and thereby a preheating of said tyres 10 is achieved so that the vulcanization process time and hence the energy consump tion thereby can be decreased. The conduit 16 comprises fan means 17 , distribution nozzles for internal air circulation for the heated process air, and a pressure reducing valve.
