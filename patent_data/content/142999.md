# Improvements in friction supporting stays for windows.

## Abstract
A friction stay comprises a track 10 which can be attached to a window frame. The track 10 has, at its upper end a nose portion 14 of plastic with a curved inner surface adapted to receive the nose portion 28 of a bar 24 which has holes 27 for receiving screws by which the window sash may be attached to bar 24. The sash will normally be supported by a pair of these stays, one on each side of the window. Bar 24 is pivotally attached to the track 10, by a link 16 joined to the bar 24 at rivet 25 and to track 10 at rivet 17. The bar 24 is also attached to a slider 15, engaged in track 10, by a link 21 pivoted on rivets 22,23. A brace 18 extends from link 16 to slider 15 and is attached by rivets 19,20. Optionally an extra link 26 may be included. To provide additional strength, in accordance with this invention, a link 31 is provided, pivoted to link 16 at 32 and to a second slider 35 at 34.
