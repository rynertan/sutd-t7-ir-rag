# Sealing structure for a movable window.

## Abstract
A sealing structure for a movable window allows a movable windowpane to lie flush with the outside of the window sill frame. The vertical edges of the windowpane are provided with projecting guides which have a runner lying somewhat offset from the plane of the rest of the pane. The guide runners are supported by elastic seals such that the pane lies flush with the outer surface of the window sill frame. A vibration damper in the shape of an inverted V may be provided at the top of the window sill frame in order to guide the top edge of the pane into place and to prevent the pane from vibrating excessively.
