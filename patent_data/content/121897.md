# Operation control method for nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
An operation control method for a nuclear reactor per forming a load follow up operation in accordance with a load variation program, wherein a core reactivity which changes with time in a first cycle of operation is predicted based on the load variation program and data for analyzing dynamic charac teristics of the reactor, and a change in a liquid poison concen tration in the first cycle of operation is obtained based on the predicted reactivity, and reactor power is controlled in the first cycle of operation by adjusting the liquid poison concentration in accordance with the obtained change. When the liquid poi son concentration is adjusted and control rods are manipulat ed, a reactivity introduced by these operations in the first cycle of operation is obtained, and an adjustment to be made to the liquid poison concentration in the second cycle of operation which is the next cycle of operation following the first cycle of operation is obtained from the reactivity introduced in the first cycle of operation. When the change in reactivity in the second cycle of operation becomes equal to that in the first cycle of operation, and reactor power is controlled in the second cycle of operation by performing the obtained adjustment of the liquid poison concentration.
