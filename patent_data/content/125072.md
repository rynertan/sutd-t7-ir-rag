# SUPPRESSION OF SPRAY FROM MOTOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
Spray suppression apparatus for motor vehicles for use in the vicinity of wheels W of the vehicles so as to provide a barrier which allows the passage of air but prevents water passing therethrough, the apparatus comprising one or more porous strips 5 which are preferably formed of bristle mater ial and which extend from the peripheries of the vehicle mud guards M into close proximity with the vehicle tyres, both internally and externally of the wheels W , there being a mud flap 1 behind each wheel W with a brush strip 17 extend ing from its lower edge and there preferably being further strips 21 extending transversely across the wheel or wheel sets W . The flexible porous strips 5, 17, 21 due to their construction, always remain air permeable but are designed so that spray is discouraged from escaping from the wheel areas but instead is returned to the road surface, especially by the strip 17 on the bottom edge of the mud flap 1 . Compo site constructions of strip may be provided and the bristles themselves may be kinked.
