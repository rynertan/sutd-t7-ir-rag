# Method and apparatus for coding heat sensitive optically readable media.

## Abstract
A method of coding an optically readable medium comprises applying to the medium at least one coating of a heat sensitive material to produce a specified combination of at least two optical changes as a function of time when heated to a predetermined temperature above ambient heating the medium to the predetermined temperature and sensing the optical changes undergone by the medium to determine whether the sensed changes match the specified combination. The method and apparatus are described particularly to an optically readable medium wherein the heat sensitive coating is in a plurality of windows formed in the medium, each window signifying a value element.
