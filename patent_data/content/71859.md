# Luminescence detection device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a luminescence detection device for quan titatively detecting an analyte in a liquid sample, which device comprises 1 a reaction compartment having, along a primary axis, opposite end portions, a first of which is for introduction of fluid reagents and sample into the compart ment and the other of which forms a light transmissive aperture of predetermined size, the compartment being suitable to hold a composition which luminesces in res ponse to contact with analyte containing sample 2 closure means in said first end portion for admitting a cannula, whereby fluid is introduced into said compartment, and for closing the reaction compartment 3 a photoresponsive imaging layer 4 means for associating the photorespon sive imaging layer and the reaction compartment such that the photoresponsive imaging layer is positioned, preferably substantially perpendicular to the primary axis of the reac tion compartment, at a predetermined distance from the end portion forming the aperture so as to be exposed to light emanating therefrom and 5 means for preventing ex posure of the photoresponsive imaging layer to ambient light.
