# FERROSILOXANE THERMAL STABILIZERS FOR DIORGANOPOLYSILOXANES

## Abstract
Ferrosiloxane compounds prepared by reacting iron carboxylates and N,N disubstituted silylamines are useful as thermal stabilizers for diorganopolysiloxanes. The thermally stable diorganopolysiloxanes find utility as heat transfer fluids, high temperature lubricants, hydraulic fluids and electric insulating fluids, to name but a few.
