# Fire resistant connections and dovetail like sealing means therefor.

## Abstract
A fire resistant connection 14 that embodies a sealing means 44 and that is operable for purposes of effectuating the establishment of a fire resistant seal between mating surfa ces 52, 54 , and in particular mating surfaces 52, 54 of the type that commonly are found to be present in wellhead and valve equipment 10 . The subject fire resistant connection 14 includes mating seal surfaces 52, 54 and the aforemen tioned sealing means 44 . The sealing means 44 comprises a seal ring 44 , which includes a plurality of seal lips 46, 48 and a dovetail shaped rib 50 , the latter 50 being formed on the seal ring 44 so as to be located in interposed relation be tween a pair of adjacent seal lips 46, 48 . Each of the plurality of seal lips 46, 48 is suitably configured so as to be positionable in sealing engagement with a corresponding one of the mating seal surfaces 52, 54 , the latter 52, 54 embodying a configu ration that is complementary in nature to that of the seal lip 46, 48 engaged thereby. Likewise, the rib 50 is suitably configur ed such that when the seal lips 46, 48 are in sealing engage ment with the mating seal surfaces 52, 54 , the rib 50 is also engaged by the mating seal surfaces 52, 54 and is locked in position thereby.
