## Description
SpecificationCyclic double stranded DNA and process for producing the same, microorganism containing said cyclic doublestranded DNA, and process for preparing protein having antigenic determinant of poliovirus caps it protein VP1 by use of them Technical field This invention relates to a production technique, utilizing the recombinant gene technique, of a protein having the antigenic determinant of the capsid proteinVP1 of poliovirus which is a pathogen of acute anterior polyomyelits. Background art At present immunization against acute anterior polyomyelitis is effected by parenteral administration of poliovirus which has been treated with formalin or other chemical reagent to lose its infectiousness while permittin3 its antigenicity to remain, namely an inactivated vaccine, or by oral administration of attenuated poliovirus itself, namely live vaccine.Of these, the inactivated vaccine requires a large amount of virus fzr immunization and therefore high in cost, and also involves the drawback that immunization cannot be maintaine over the whole life.On the other hand, live vaccine has the probability that a highly ,vlthogenic strain may arise through mutation which may occur on the virus gene after repeated proliferation. zDr this reason, there are involved the problems of danger of outbreak of disease by inoculation of live vaccine and exhaustion of seed virus, particularly Sabin type 3. Also, it has the problems such as danger of administration to immuno deficient people, contaminant of monkey tumor virus by use of monkey cells, difficult availability of monkey under emergent circumstances, exhaustion and high cost of monkey source in the future.It has also been attempted to produce an immunizing protein in E. coli cells in place of live vaccine. That is, van der Werf, S., et al Gene, 23, 85 1983 3 andMarr Jirow Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 173084 1984 produced the capsid protein VP1 in the form of a fused protein by expression of cDNA coading for the capsid protein VP1 of type 1 strongly poisonous strainMahoney type in E. coli. It is described there that corresponding DNA sequences of attenuated strains such asSabin type 1, 2 and 3 may also be used, but neither specific means nor possibility of practice is shown. On the other hand, Kuge, S., et al Journal of Biochemistry, 96, 305 1984 3 produced the capsid protein VP1 as the fused protein by expression of the cDNA coding for the capsid protein VP1 of Sabin type 1 incorporated in a plasmid containing an ampicillin resistant gene by use of trp promoter.However, in both of these methods, the amount of VP1 expressed is very minute, and it would be desirable to have an emergence of a method capable of producing a large amount of the capsid protein VP1.The present inventors studied intensively in order to cancel the problems of the prior art as mentioned above, and consequently successfully produced a protein having an antigen determinant of the specific protein of poliovirus in a large amount to accomplish the present invention.In the present specification, non fused means no fusion with a polypeptide other than the proteins derived from polyovirus, and the VP3 protein of poliovirus encoded.before VP1 may be attached, or the VP1 protein containing a part from its intermediate portion may be also included.The present invention is intended to provide a plasmid and a microorganism capable of producing a protein having the antigenic determinant of the capsid protein VPl of the attenuated strain of poliovirus as the fused protein or in the non fused form, and a process for producing said protein by use thereof.

The cyclic double stranded DNA of the present invention should preferably contain a portion coding for ampicillin resistance downstream of the temperature sensitive gene portion, and said portion should more preferably be derived from the pBR322 plasmid.The first cyclic double stranded DNA can be prepared, for example, as follows.The pCQV2 plasmid is digested with the restriction endonuclease Cla I and the protruded end digested with S1 nuclease to make it a blunt end, which is cyclized again with T4DNA ligase, thereby extinguishing the Cla I site to obtain the pHT 1 plasmid. The cyclic DNA obtained was transformed into, for example, Escherichia coli HB 101 strain following the method of Cohen et al ProceedingNational Academic Science USA Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA , 69, 2110 1972 , and the pHTl plasmid containing strains are screened with ampicillin resistance as the marker and amplified. From the transformed strain, the pHT 1 plasmid is isolated. Between the Bam HI site and the Eco RI site of the plasmid, there is contained the temperature sensitive gene cIts which is the repressor of the PR and PL promoters of phage A. By digesting the pHTl plasmid with Eco RI and Bam HI, the fragment containing cIts is isolated. This fragment comprises the DNA sequence shown by the above formula CG IX . The GC base pairs which existed at the Cla I site of the corresponding fragment of pCQV 2 which existed T the T A pair between the base pair at the 26 th and the TA base at the 27 th in the above formula IX has been removed.On the other hand, the pKC 30 plasmid is digested withEco RI and Bgl II to separate a long fragment therefrom. This fragment has one Bam HI site, and the DNA sequence from the Eco RI end to the Bam HI site corresponds to theDNA sequence anticlockwise from the Eco RI site of the pBR322 to the Bam HI site on the restriction endonuclease cleaved map. In this sequence, the portion coding for ampicillin resistance and the initiation point for duplication in E. coli are contained. There exists also one Hpa I site between the Bam HI site and the Bgl II end, and the PL promoter operator exists between the BglII end and the Hpa I site. The DNA sequence between theBgl II end and the Hpa I site is shown by the above formula I .The both fragments as obtained above are ligated withT4DNA ligase and cyclized to construct the pHT 2 plasmid.The plasmid is cloned similarly as the pHT 1 plasmid to be amplified.The pYT 3 plasmid is digested with the restriction endonuclease Sst II, the C 230 fragment containing the portion coding for metapyrocatechase is isolated and the 3 protruded end is digested with T4DNA polymerase to be made a blunt end.The pHT 2 plasmid is subjected to ring opening by digestion with the restriction endonuclease Hpa I and then theC 230 fragment with the blunt end is inserted thereinto, followed by ring closure, to construct the pHT 3 plasmid. E. coli is transformed with this plasmid and, with the use of ampicillin resistance as the marker, the colony colored in yelow with an aqueous catechol solution after elevation of the culture temperature to about 42 OC in the course of cultivation is collected, followed by cloning and amplification of the plasmid.In place of the C 230 fragment from the pYT 3 plasmid, the pSLMK 1 plasmid of the transformants having this plasmid, Escherichia coli HB 101 pSLMK 1 is deposited atFERM as the FERM P 7816, Escherichia coli W 31l0 pStMK 1 as the FERM P 7617, Escherichia coli RR l pStMK 1 as theFERM P 7618 and Escherichia coli RB 79l pSLMK 1 as theFERM P 7619, respectively or the pTCCM 1 plasmid of the transformants having this plasmid, Escherichia coli RB 791 pTCCM is deposited at FERM on August 17, 1984 as FERMP 77815, and transferred to the international deposition based on the Budapest Treaty on August 8, 1985, and given the number of FERM BP 862 may be digested with Eco RI, and the resultant C 230 fragment filled at both protruded ends with dNTP and inserted into the plamid pHT 2 to prepare the pHT 3 plasmid.The method for preparation of the pSLMK 1 plasmid is described in detail in Japanese Patent Application No.97106 1984.Next, the pHT 3 plasmid is digested with Bam HI, the protruded ends are repaired with T4DNA polymerase orKlenow fragment to be made blunt ends, and further digested partially with Pvu II, followed again by cyclization with T4DNA ligase to obtain the pHT 31 plasmid. At the ligated portion, the Bam HI portion is regenerated. The pHT 31 plasmid is digested with Sal I, the protruded portions are repaired with T4DNA ligase orKlenow fragment to make them blunt ends, and further digested with Pvu II, followed again by cyclization withT4DNA ligase to construct the pHT 311 plasmid. At the ligated portion, the Sal I is regenerated.The operations of the pHT 3 plasmid et seq are operations for making an appropriate restriction endonuclease site at the DNA portion coding for the N terminus portion of metapyrocatechase, and it is also possible to attempt insertion of the poliovirus cDNA fratment through utilization of the Pvu II site in the metapyrocatechase gene by digesting the pHT 3 plasmid partially with Pvu II. Next, the pHT 311 plasmid is digested with Sal I, the protruded ends are repaired with T4DNA polymerase orKlenow fragment to be made blunt ends to obtain a DNA fragment. On the other hand, a DNA fragment is prepared containing the VP1 gene from the cDNA derived from poliovirus.For example, in Sabin type 1, the pBB 2 plasmid is digested with Taq I, the protruded ends are repaired withT4DNA polymerase and a DNA fragment containing VP1 is isolated. Said DNA fragment and the DNA fragment obtained from the pHT 311 plasmid as described above are subjected to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase to construct the pHTP 31 plasmid.The pBB 2 plasmid is digested with Bam HI and Hin cII, the protruded ends are repaired with T4DNA polymerase, and the DNA fragment containing VP1 is isolated. SaidDNA fragment and the DNA fragment obtained from the pHT 311 plasmid as described above asre subjected to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase to construct the pYTP 100 plasmid. The pHTP plasmid is digested with Kpn I to prepare a DNA fragment.The pBB 2 plasmid is digested with Kpn I to separate aDNA fragment containing the carboxylic terminus hereinafter called C terminus of VP1. Said fragment and theDNA fragment obtained by digestion of the pHTP 31 plasmid with Kpn I are subjected to ligating cyclization withT4DNA ligase to construct the pYTP 11 plasmid.As for Sabin type 2, for example, the pVS 2 2503 plasmid is digested with Kpn I and Pvu II, the protruded ends are repaired with T4DNA to be made blunt ends, and the DNA fragment containing VP1 is isolated. Said DNA fragment and the DNA fragment obtained from the pHT 311 plasmid as described above are subjected to ligating cyclization to construct the pYTP 200 plasmid.As for Sabin type 3, for example, the pVS 3 2603 plasmid is digested with Sph I and Bgl II, the protruded ends are repaired with T4DNA polymeraze or Klenow fragment to be made blunt ends, and the DNA fragment containing VP1 is isolated. Said DNA fragment and the DNA fragment obtained from the pHT 311 plasmid as described above are subjected to ligating cyclization to construct the pYTP 300 1 plasmid. This does not coincide in frame of amino acids of a part of the metapyrocatechase gene and the DNA derived from poliovirus. Accordingly, for coincidence in frame, the pYTP 300 1 plasmid is digested with Sal I, the protruded ends digested with S1 nuclease, followed by recylization with T4DNA ligase to construct the pYTP 300 plasmid. The second cyclic double stranded DNA of the present invention can be prepared, for example, as follows.First, for making the N terminus of the poliovirus VPl protein in the non fused form, the vector pYTU3 for expression deposited at FERM as Escherichia coli HB101 pYTU3 FERM P 7982 can be utilized. The pYTU plasmid is digested with Sal I, the protruded ends are digested with S1 nuclease to be made blunt ends, whereinto the DNA fragment coding for the VP1 antigen region of poliovirusSabin type 1, Sabin type 2 or Sabin type 3 made to have blunt ends is inserted. In the case of Sabin type 1, for example, the fused type expression plasmid pHTP31 plasmid or the pYTPll plasmid can be used.The pHTP31 plasmid and the pYTPll plasmid are deposited at American Type Culture Collection ATCC as Escherichia coli C 600 pHTP31 and Escherichia coli C 600 pYTPll, respectively, and attached with the deposition numbers ofATCC 39976 and ATCC 39972, respectively.When using the pHTP31 plasmid, this is digested with the restriction endonuclease Sal I to obtain a DNA fragment of 713 base pairs. The DNA fragment may be blunted at the ends with T4DNA polymerase and insereted into the SalI site of the blunt end of pYTU3 with the use of T4DNA ligase, but without blunting of the ends, the Sal I digested DNA fragment of the pYTU3 plasmid and the DNA fragment of Sal I 713 base pairs containing the VP1 protein antigen site can be cyclized again with the use of T4DNA ligase to obtain the pYTP102. Next, the operation of making the C end non fused is conducted. The pYTP102 plasmid is digested with the restriction endonuclease Kpn I and then blunted the ends with T4DNA polymerase.The commercially available oligonucleotide of 16 base pairs having translation termination codon TAA in three frames hereinafter called translation termination unit represented by the following formula X 5... . GCTTAATTAATTAAGC .3 3 1 CGAATTAATTAATTCC 5 wherein A, G, C and T have the same meanings as defiend above , is phosphorylated at the 5 end with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and this was subjected to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase together with the DNA fragment obtained by digestion of the pYTP 102 plasmid with Kpn I, followed by blunting of the ends with T4DNA polymerase, to obtain the pYTP102K plasmid. On the other hand, non fused N terminus and C terminus can be also constructed at the same time. The pYTPll plasmid is digested with Pst I, followed by blunting of the ends with T4DNA polymerase. Said DNA fragment is ligated with the translation termination unit with T4DNA ligase. Further, after digestion of the restriction endonuclease Sal I followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment of 1050 base pairs containing the region coding for the VP1 protein antigen site is recovered.Double digestion of the pYTU3 plasmid with the restriction endonucleases Sal I and Nru I gives a DNA fragment of 4000 base pairs, which is subjected together with the above DNA fragment of 1050 base pairs to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase to obain the pYTP102P plasmid.As for Sabin type 2, for example, after digestion of the fused type expressed plasmid pYTP200 with the restriction endonuclease Sal I followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment of about 1160 base pairs containing the region coding for the VP1 protein antigen site is recovered. Said fragment and the DNA fragment obtained by digestion with the pYTU3 plasmid are subjected to ligating cyclization to construct the pYTP201. The pYTP201 plasmid is digested with the restriction endonuclease Nar I and blunted the ends with T4DNA polymerase.Said DNA fragment and the 5 end phosphorylated product obtained by treating the translation termination unit with T4polynucleotide kinase are subjected to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase to construct the pYTP201N plasmid. The pYTP plasmid is deposited at ATCC as Escherichia coli 600 pYTP200, and attached with the deposition number ofATCC 39977.As for Sabin type 3, for example, after digestion of the fused type expressed plasmid pYTP300 with the restriction endonuclease Pst I, it is blunted the ends with T4DNA polymerase and then digested with the restriction endonuclease Bam HI, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, to obtain a DNA fragment of about 1500 base pairs.On the other hand, the pYTU3 plasmid is digested with the restriction endonuclease Sal I, followed by blunting the ends with S1 nuclease. Subsequently, after digestion with the restriction endonucelase with Bam HI followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, a DNA fragment of about 3800 base pairs is recovered. Said DNA fragment and the above fragment of about 1500 base pairs are subjected to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase to obtain a pYTP301 plasmid.The pYTP301 plasmid is digested with the restriction endonuclease Kpn I, blunted the ends with T4DNA polymerase, and then said DNA fragment and the 5 end phosphorylated product obtained by treatment of the translation termination unit with T4polynucleotide kinase were subjected to ligating cyclization with T4DNA ligase to obtain the pYTP301K plasmid.The pYTP300 plasmid is deposited at ATCC as Escherichia coli C 600 pYTP 300, and is attached with the deposition number of ATCC 39973.Of the plasmids as prepared above, the pYTP102K plasmid, the pYTPlO2P plasmid and the pYTP301K plasmid code only methionine coded by ATG at the N terminus and only 1 to 2 amino acids coded by the translation termination unit at the C terminus other than the polypeptide derived from the poliovirus Sabin type, while the pYTP201N plasmid codes methionine coded by ATG and one or two amino acids for coding the restriction endonuclease cleavage site at the N terminus and only one amino acid coded by the translation termination unit at the C terminus other than the polypeptide derived from the poliovirus Sabin type.In the above operations, for digestion with respective restriction endonucleases, ligation with T4DNA ligase, screening with the use of ampicillin resistance and amplification of respective plasmids, all conventional methods can be used. For purification by separation of respective DNA fragments and plasmids, conventional techniques such as extraction with phenol, precipitation with ethanol agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent extraction techniques, separation by liquid chromatogrpahy, etc. can be utilized.
