# DUAL FLOW SCREENING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A pressurized screening device has an inlet arrangement 18,20 by which a feed slurry is directed to a central portion of a screening chamber 16 . A plurality of chevron shaped rotor foils 36 are mounted for rotation near the inner surface of a cylindrical screenplate 12 to split the flow of the feed slurry into separate flow portions directed toward opposite ends of the screening chamber 16 , and separate reject chambers 24,26 are provided adjacent opposite ends of the screening chamber. The chevron shaped foil structure 36 enables the screening device to operate as if it were two smaller screening devices and to remove efficiently both light and heavy impurities from the feed stock.
