# Aluminum and silica clad refractory oxide thermal spray powder.

## Abstract
A thermal spray powder comprising particles with a central core of a material selected from the group consisting of zirconium oxide, magnesium oxide, hafnium oxide, cerium oxide, yttrium oxide and combinations thereof. The core then has discrete aluminum particles and silicon dioxide homogeneously disposed in a binder deposited thereon to form the thermal spray powder which may be thermal sprayed to produce an abradable and erosion resistant coating.
