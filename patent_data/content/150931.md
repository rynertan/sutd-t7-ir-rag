# Reinforced composite structures.

## Abstract
A reinforced composite structure comprising parallel, aligned continuous filaments extending along the maximum dimension of the structure, said fibres being bonded together with a thermoplastic matrix polymer which intimately contacts substantially the whole of the surface of the filaments char acterised in that the reinforcement of the structure comprises at least 30 by volume of filamentary reinforcing material and from 1 up to 30 by volume, preferably from 5 to 15 by volume of particulate filler. The preferred process for produc ing the product use a mixture of polymer, filler and melt plasti ciser for the polymer to effect impregnation of the continuous fibres with the melt plasticiser subsequently being volatilised at a temperature at which the polymer is molten.
