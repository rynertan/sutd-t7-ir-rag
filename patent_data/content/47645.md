# A method of producing an information recording disk.

## Abstract
In a device for producing information recording disks comprises a stamper mount 3 for placing a stamper 1 thereon, a stamper fixing shaft 25 for fixing the stamper, and a pressing plate for pressing a backing plate toward the stamper after a liquid resin 9 is injected in the space between the backing plate and the stamper through an injection valve 26 provided at the center of the stamper mount, a flange portion 35 of the injection valve is wetted by the liquid resin before the backing plate is placed on the flange portion. The stretching speed of the resin is control led so that air bubbles are prevented from being taken into the resin. The stamper may be attracted by magnetic forces to the stamper mount. A stamper having a fixing ring at its center may be used so that eccentricity is avoided.
