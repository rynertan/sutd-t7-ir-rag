# METHOD FOR EFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR REFERENCE COUNTING

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for managing a block oriented memory 40, 42, 44 of the type in which each memory block 14 16, 20 23, 30 32 has an associated reference count representing the number of pointers to it from other memory blocks and itself. Efficient and cost effective implementation of reference counting alleviates the need for frequent garbage collection, which is an expensive operation. The apparatus includes a hash table 83 into which the virtual addresses of blocks of memory which equal zero are maintained. When the reference count of a block increases from zero, its virtual address is removed from the table 83 . When the reference count of a block decreases to zero, its virtual address is inserted into the table 83 . When the table 83 is full, a reconciliation operation is performed to identify those addresses which are contained in a set of binding registers associated with the CPU 10 , and any address not contained in the binding registers are evacuated into a garbage buffer for subsequent garbage collection opera tions. The apparatus can be implemented by a cache augmented by the hash table 83 , providing a back up store for the cache.
