# Anti human lung cancer monoclonal antibodies.

## Abstract
A human lung tumour specific monoclonal antibody which binds to an antigen specific to human lung tumour but not to an antigen of normal human tissue of the lung or to an antigen of other organs, may be made by culturing a suitably selected hybridoma made by fusing antibody producing cells from an animal immunised with human lung cancer antigens, with myeloma cells.
