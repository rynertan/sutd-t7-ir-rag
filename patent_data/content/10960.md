# Method and apparatus for producing a temperature sensitive ferromagnetic element.

## Abstract
A ferromagnetic body comprises fine grain powder of a spin reorientation type ferromagnetic material having a transition temperature range, below which transition temperature range the easy direction of magnetisation of the material is one direction and above which the easy direction of magnetisation is in another direction perpen dicular to the one direction. Thus, as the body is sub jected to temperatures in its transition temperature range its easy direction of magnetisation varies and the property is used to provide an indication of its temperature. The ferromagnetic body is produced by compacting the fine grain powder 54 at a temperature higher than the transition temperature range. The apparatus for making the bodies includes compacting means 51, 52, 53 means for exerting a magnetic field 57 and heating means 55 . It is possible to use a polycrystalline rare earth cobalt alloy ferromagnetic material where low Curie point ferrite or where bimetallic strips have been used before in, for example, thermostats.
