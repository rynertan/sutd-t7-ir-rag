# Crystallized, readily water dispersible sugar product containing heat sensitive, acidic or high invert sugar substances.

## Abstract
A crystallized sugar product containing a heat sensitive, acidic, or high invert sugar substance is prepared by admixing the heat sensitive, acidic, or high invert sugar substance with a dry sugar base to form a premix, concen trating a sugar syrup containing at least about 85 by weight sucrose to a solids content of about 95 to about 98 by heating to a temperature of about 255 F. to about 300 F., mixing the premix with the concentrated sugar syrup to form a mixture, subjecting the mixture to impact beating within a crystallization zone until a dry crystallized sugar product is formed, and recovering the sugar product from the crystalli zation zone. The resulting sugar product comprises aggre gates of fondant size sucrose crystals intimately associated with the heat sensitive, acidic, or high invert sugar sub stance. The sugar product is dry, granular, free flowing, non caking, and readily dispersible in water.
