# A process for enhanced oil recovery by gas injection and apparatus for use therein.

## Abstract
A process for enhanced oil recovery by gas injection into oil bearing formations 4 which comprises wet oxidizing combustible carbonaceous materials with oxygen, air or a mixture of oxygen and air to obtain a gas comprising a mix ture of water vapor and carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the event air is used , substantially free of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen injecting said gaseous mixture into an oil bearing formation to produce a mixture of oil and water extracting said mixture of oil and water from the oil bearing formation separating the water from the latter mixture and recycling the water to the wet oxidation reactor 1 . Residual oil in the recycled water provides additional fuel for the wet oxidation reaction, and at the same time the need for costly water treatment is eliminated.
