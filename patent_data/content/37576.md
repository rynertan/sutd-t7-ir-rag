# Snow tire spikes.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to snow tire spikes for use with automobiles adapted to run on frozen road surfaces or on snow. The snow tire spike comprises a spike body 4 formed by using a ceramic stock molded by pressing with dies and a flange 5 made of plastics which coats at least its end part on the side attached to the tire. The larger diameter anchoring part 6 formed at the end of the attaching side of the spike body 4 is larger than the end part on the ground touching side of the spike body 4 , but has a diameter smaller than 1.5 times that of the latter. This larger diameter part is wholly coated with plastics, and is unified with the outer circumferen tial part of the spike body 4 extending contiguousiy to the end part on the ground touching side through a smoothly tapered or arc shaped joining surface 7 .
