# A system for charging the photoconductor device of a xerographic machine.

## Abstract
In a xerographic machine, a corona discharge device 306 is energised by a pulse width modulated power supply 304 . Feedback signals, If related to the photoconductor current Is and grid current Ig of the corona device are applied to a threshold detector 303 . The power supply 304 is controlled by a digital regulator 301 to optimise the voltage applied to the corona device. The digital regulator output is controlled by a digital value held in and UP DOWN counter in the regulator. When the power supply is switched ON, the digital value is varied in response to output signals on lines 202 and 203 from the threshold detector. When the supply is switched OFF during operation of the machine, the digital value is kept constant at the last value arrived at before this switching OFF. In addition when the machine is switched ON, a predetermined value is entered into the UP DOWN counter from machine logic 300 .
