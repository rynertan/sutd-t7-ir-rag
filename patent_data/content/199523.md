# Labelling apparatus.

## Abstract
A labelling apparatus holds an article to which a label is to be stuck on a holder, and then moves the holder carrying the article from a home position via a waiting position and a labelling position back to the home position. In a label peeling and issuing section, the article is moved up toward a label being issued in the label peeling and issuing section and is brought into contact with the label so that the label is peeled from the supporting strip and stuck to the article as the holder holding the article is moved toward the home position along the guide paths. A reverse movement pre venting plates prevents the reverse movement of the holder as the holder is moved along the guide paths. Thus the label can be simply stuck to the article automatically without requiring manual labelling operation.
