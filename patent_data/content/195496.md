However, a unit dose will normally contain 5 to 500 mg for example 20 to 200 mg, of compound I , II , III , IV or V . Unit doses will normally be administered once or more than once a day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, more usually 2 to 4 times a day, such that the total daily dose is normally in the range, for a 70 kg adult of 5 to 1000 mg, for example 50 to 600 mg, that is in the range of approximately 0.07 to 15 mg kg day, more usually 1 to 10 mg kg day, for example 2 to 5 mg kg day.Suitably a compound of formula I , II , III , IV or V is administered in the form of a unit dose composition, such as a unit dose oral or parenteral composition. Such compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use.Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabletting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art.Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate.Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl sulphate. These solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers.Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art.Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.Oral formulations also include conventional sustained release formulations, such as tablets or granules having an enteric coating.

The following pharmacological data illustrates the activity of a compounds of formulae I , II , III , IV or V in tests which are indicative of its potential use in the treatment of proliferative skin disease such as psoriasis. Pharmacological DataThe activity of cyclic AMP phosphodierterase in homogenates of rat gastocnemius muscle was measured in the presence of various concentrations of compounds of formulae I , II , III , IV or V using 0.31 M cyclic AMP as substration. The reciprocal of the reaction rate was plotted on the y axis against the concentration of each compound on the x axis Dixon plot . The apparent Ki value was estimated by extrapolating the steeper linear portion of the Dixon plot to the x axis and obtaining the negative intercept on the x axis.
