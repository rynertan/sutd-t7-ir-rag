# Method of selecting composite reception signal in ultrasonic inspection apparatus and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is, in an ultrasonic flaw detecting technique in which reflection echoes B₁ B₄ of ultrasonic waves A₁ A₄ transmitted from a plurality of vibrator elements 3A 3D are received, and a composite signal obtained by composing the reception signals is supplied to a composite signal recep tion processing circuit, a method and an apparatus therefor in which the existence of the composite signal is detected at a first time point at which the composite signal based on the reflection echoes from an inspection target F in a main lobe can be detected and at a second and a third time point which are in advance and in the behind of the first time point respectively and at which the composite signal based on the reflection echoes from an inspection target F in the main lobe can not be detected, so that when the existence of the composite signal is detected only at the first time point, it is determined that the composite signal is that based on the reflection echoes from the inspection target F .
