## Description
SURFACTANTS DERIVED FROM DICARBOXYLIC HYDROXYACIDSThe present invention relates to non toxic, biodegradable surfactants derived from dicarboxylic hydroxyacids.In the large number of classes of known surfactants it is uncommon for a single product to combine a variety of characteristics such as biodegradability, non toxicity, lack of irritating effect on the skin and high solubility in water with excellent detergent properties, making such a product particularly versatile and allowing it to be used in such different areas as, for instance, in detergents in general and, more particularly, for use in cleansing agents, in the food industry, in the textile industry, in emulsion polymerisation, in cosmetics etc.According to the present invention surfactants have now been found which are derived from dicarboxylic hydroxyacids, more particularly, surfactants consisting of monoesters and or diesters of tartaric acid or malic acid with polyoxyalky lated aliphatic alcohols as well as the salts of the monoesters with inorganic or organic bases. These surfactants exhibit the above mentioned combination of characteristics and, therefore, are effective in a wide range of application.Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide esters of dicarboxylic hydroxyacids having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R2 is H or OH R, R are equal to or different from each other and represent a hydrogen atom, a metal ion, an ammonium group, the cation of an organic amine base or a group having the formula An R3 II wherein A is a C2 C4 oxyalkylene group, n is a number of from 1 to 20 and R3 is a C8 C20 alkyl group, provided that at least one of said R, R is a group A H3, and wherein n the OH group or OH groups of the compound of formula I may be esterified or etherified by conventional methods.The metal ion is preferably selected from sodium, potassium and magnesium.The cation of an organic amine base can, for instance, be derived from an alkanolamine, such as monoethanolamine and triethanolamine.The radical R3 is preferably selected from linear or branched alkyl groups containing from 10 to 16 carbon atoms.The oxyalkylene group A is preferably an oxyethylene group CH2 CH2 O and n preferably has a value of from 4 to 10.A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the esters having the formula I , which comprises the esterification of tartaric or malic acid with a polyoxyalkylated aliphatic alcohol having the formula R3 An OH III wherein R3, A and n have the meaning specified above, by heating to a temperature of from 150 to 1900C under continuous distillation of the water formed during the reaction and, optionally, final conversion of the obtained product into a salt with metal bases, ammonia or amines.By the above mentioned process mono and diesters having the following formulae are obtained monoester of tartaric acid EMI2.1 monoester of malic acid monoester of malic acid diester of tartaric acid diester of malic acid EMI3.1 According to the reaction conditions employed and, in particular, depending on the molar ratios of acid to polyoxyalkylated alcohol either mono or diesters may be prepared, as preferred.Thus, the acid and the polyoxyalkylated alcohol are reacted in substantially equtmolar ratios in order to preferentially produce monoesters having the formulae IV , V and VI , whereas they are reacted in molar ratios of about 1 2 in order to produce the diesters having formula VII or VIII .In the case of preparing the monester of tartaric acid and a polyoxyethylated alcohol, the reaction may be represented by the following equation EMI3.2 The polyoxyalkylated alcohols of formula III are known products which are commercially available. Ethoxylated alcohols may be prepared by reaction of the alcohol with ethylene oxide, catalyzed by alkaline bases. The ethoxylated alcohols having the formula R3 oCH2CH2 n oH, wherein R3 is a linear or branched alkyl group containing from 10 to 16 carbon atoms and n has a value of from 4 to 8, as well as the mixtures thereof are preferred.The esters according to the present invention and, particularly, the monoesters of the ethoxylated aliphatic alcohols, their salts or mixtures thereof, are very efficient surfactants which, although they are used in very low percentages, result in a remarkable lowering of the surface tension and, therefore, may be used as emulsifying agents, dispersants and detergents in general.They have excellent detergent properties and do not exhibit any noxious or irritating effect on the skin or on the eyes nor do they have any acute toxicity if they are ingested.They are highly biodegradable, their biodegradability being over 90 . They have proved to be stable within a wide temperature range of up to 10000. They show very good wetting properties and foam forming ability and their solubility in water is from moderate to excellent. In particular, their solubility increases as the number of moles of ethylene oxide contained in the alkylether chain increases.The esters according to the invention have proved to be compatible with most of the known surfactants and, therefore, they may be combined with them.Due to their characteristics, the esters according to the invention have proved to be very flexible as regards the different applications of surfactants. On account of their high detergent power, combined with the lack of toxic effects on the skin, hair and eyes, they are particularly suitable for cosmetic applications such as, for instance, in the preparation of liquid or creamy detergents for the skin, in shampoos and bathfoams.The following examples illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it in any way.
