# Apparatus for synchronizing rotary members.

## Abstract
A system for interlocking the rotation of master and slave shafts is particularly suitable for use in film editing tables. The or each slave shaft 33 is controlled by, firstly, a velocity servo loop which compels the slave shaft to rotate in precise speed synchronism with a remote or line master shaft 33a . This primary feedback loop compromises encoders 36, 35 generating trains of pulses having a characteristic representative of rotational speed, and bipolar frequency to voltage converters 42, 43 deriving from these pulse trains analogue voltages which are applied to a differential amplifier 32 to produce an error signal to be driven to zero for control of the slave shaft speed. Additionally, a secondary feedback loop includes a digital to analogue converter 41 for deriving a third analogue voltage proportional to the digitally measured difference between the characteristics of the first and second trains of digital pulses. This third analogue voltage is combined with the first or second analogue voltage in a mixer 37 to form a composite input to the differential amplifier and, being derived through a secondary feedback loop parallel to the primary loop, maintains the shaft feed in precisely interlocked synchronism.
