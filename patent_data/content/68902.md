## Description
WATER DEVELOPABLE LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATE MATERIAL The present invention relates to a lithographic printing plate material, and more particularly to a waterdevelopable lithographic printing plate material comprising a diazo resin. There are known water developable lithographic printing plate materials having a composite comprising a water soluble macromolecular compound and a water soluble diazo resin. Photosensitive layers obtained by coating said composite are water soluble, therefore careful attention has to be paid to handling them so they do not come into contact with a dampish hand, for example, accordingly handling efficiency is seriously reduced. It has also been impossible to preserve them for a long period of time, because they are liable to be affected by moisture in the air. Further, they have less affinity for printing ink and possess very poor printability, because the photohardened coat thereof is hydrophilic and fragile. In order to solve the ab6ve mentioned problems, an attempt has been made to coat a lipophilic resin on a water soluble photosensitive layer, with the surface of the printing plate material rendered hydrophobic. However, the said plate material has a double layer system, so that its preparation is complicated, with a consequent unavoidable high cost, and the resolution power is also poor. Some attempts have also been made using a single layer system. For example, in Japanese PatentPublication Open to Public Inspection hereinafter referred to as O P 1 No 2520 1977, there is disclosed a printing plate material comprising an aqueous emulsion of lipophilic resin and a water soluble diazo resin, however moisture is liable to affect the plate material and the preservability and the stability thereof is poor. Also in O P 1 No 120028 1980, for example, there is disclosed a printing plate material comprising a homogeneous mixture of a lipophilic film forming resin, a free radical polymerisable unsaturated compound, a lipophilic diazo compound, a water soluble resin and an initiator.However, oxygen in the air is liable to affect said plate material and the preservability and the stability thereof is poor Again, in O P 1 No 59433 1980, there is disclosed a printing plate material comprising an epoxy resin and a lipophilic diazo resin.However the preservability and the stability thereof is poor because of the reaction of said epoxy resin during storage in the dark. Thus, up to the present time there has not yet been devised a lithographic printing plate material which can be developed with water, the resolving power of which is excellent, which is unaffected by oxygen, and the preservability and stability of which are also excellent. The present invention is intended to solve these problems. According to this invention there is provided a lithographic printing plate material possessing excellent resolving power, preservability and stability, waterresisting properties and lipophilic properties, which prints well and which possesses excellent water developability, and is substantially unaffected by oxygen. The lithographic printing plate material of this invention comprises a photosensitive layer containing an oil soluble diazo resin and a non photosensitive resin having a moisture sorption ratio within the range of 5 20 at 80 of the relative humidity on a support. The oil soluble diazo resin to be used in the invention is preferably an oil soluble condensate of an aromatic diazonium salt and an active carbonyl containing compound such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, inter alia a condensate of said salt and formaldehyde. Preferred oil soluble resins include organic solvent soluble diazo resin inorganic acid salts such as a reaction product which is a condensate of, for example, a p diazo diphenylamine salt and formaldehyde or acetaldehyde with an inorganic acid salt such as a hexafluorophosphate, a tetrafluoroborate, a perchlorate or a periodate, or a diazo resin organic acid salt such as a reaction product, as described in US Patent No 3 300 309, which is produced by the reaction of the above mentioned condensate with an organic acid or a salt thereof, for example a sulfonic acid such as p toluene sulfonic acid or a salt thereof, a phosphinic acid such as benzene phosphinic acid or a salt thereof, a hydroxyl group containing compound such as 2 hydroxy 4 methoxy benzophenone 5 sulfonic acid or a salt thereof. Preferred non photosensitive resins which can be used in this invention include A a cellulose derivative or a polyvinyl alcohol derivative, B a homopolymer of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, or a copolymer of said acid with one or more copolymerisable monomers, C a homopolymer of acrylamide monomers, methacrylamide monomers, acrylic ester monomers having a hydroxyl group or methacrylic ester monomers having a hydroxyl group, or a copolymer of said monomers with one or more copolymerisable monomers. Typical examples of the cellulose derivatives to be used in the invention are those in which at least one of the hydrogen atoms in the hydroxyl group in cellulose is substituted by an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl and or acyl group Specific examples of said cellulose derivatives include hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose hexahydrophthalate, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and propyl cellulose. Concrete examples of polyvinyl alcohol derivatives to be used in the invention are those having a saponification value of 20 50 , specifically those of formula EMI5.1 EMI6.1 m and n being such that the molecular weight is 1 000 to 100 000. Examples of suitable acrylamides, methacrylamides, acrylic esters having a hydroxyl group, and methacrylic esters having a hydroxyl group include those having the following General Formula I Formula I EMI6.2 EMI6.3 Monomers which give the monomer units ofFormula I include acrylamide, p hydroxyphenyl methacrylamide, hydroxymethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate. In the invention, copolymers containing an acrylic acid unit, methacrylic acid unit, an acrylamide unit, a methacrylamide unit, an acrylester unit having a hydroxyl group or a methacryl ester having a hydroxyl group as the monomer unit thereof, may contain at least one kind of said monomer units. The proportion of said monomer units in the copolymer is preferably not less than 30 by weight. Concrete examples of the homopolymers of the copolymers containing at least one kind of the aforesaid units are given as follows, the weight percentages of the monomer units being put in parentheses 1 Polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2 Poly p hydroxyphenyl methacrylamide, 3 Copolymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate butyl acrylate styrene 40 15 35 4 Copolymer of hydroxyethyl methacrylate butyl acrylate acrylic acid styrene 40 25 10 25 5 Copolymer of p hydroxyphenyl methacrylamide acrylonitrile butyl acrylate acrylic acid 20 20 40 20 63 Copolymer of butyl methacrylate acrylic acid styrene 25 50 25 73 Copolymer of methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate acrylic acid styrene 10 10 50 30 83 Copolymer of butyl acrylate acrylic acid hydroxyethyl acrylate 30 30 40 93 Copolymer of butyl acrylate methacrylic acid 50 50 The moisture sorption ratio of the non photosensitive resin to be used in the invention is within the range of 5 20 at the relative humidity of 80 . In the invention, if the moisture sorption ratio exceeds 20 , then the waterrepellency ink acceptability and the preservability and stability of the printing plate material are reduced.On the other hand, if the moisture sorption ratio thereof is not more than 5 , then the developability of the printing plate material deteriorates considerably The said moisture sorption ratio can be measured in accordance with the weighing bottle method as described in a Handbook of Materials and Moisture p. 177, edited by The Society of Polymer Science, Japan, pub lished by The Kyoritsu publishing Co., 1968. The lithographic printing plate materials of the invention do not contain any significant quantity of water soluble resin, so that they are not affected by traces of moisture and they can be developed with water in spite of the fact that no significant quantity of water soluble compound is contained therein. These facts could not have been predicted. Although we do not wish to be bound by any particular theory, we infer said facts from the phenomenon that when the development is carried out with water, a layer in the area exposed to light is not affected by water because a mesh like structure is formed which hardens solidly in said area, while in the area unexposed to light water permeates into said non photosensitive resin thereby lowering its Young s modulus so that it softens, thus the printing plate material is developed by applying a physical force thereonto. As for the supports of the printing plate material, a plastics film e.g. cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene , an aluminium plate, a zinc plate, a copper plate or a chromeplated iron plate, for example, can be used. When using a support having a metallic surface, and an aluminium surface in particular, it is preferable to give it a surface treatment, for example a sandblast treatment, dipping it in an aqueous solution such as a sodium silicate, potassium fluorozirconate or phosphate solution, and or an anodic oxidation treatment. An aluminium plate which has been treated by sandblast and then treated by dipping into an aqueous solution of sodium silicate as described in US Patent No 2 714 066 or an aluminium plate which is anodized and then dipped into an aqueous solution of an alkaline metal silicate as described inJapanese Patent Examined Publication No 5125 1972 are particularly suitable for such supports. The amount of the aforesaid photosensitive layer to be provided on the support depends upon the purpose of using the printing plate material of the invention, but it is suitably 0.5 100 mg dmê and more preferably 5.0 50 mg dm2. It is preferable that the amount of oil soluble diazo resin added is 1 20 by weight of the gross weight of the photosensitive layer. The amount of the nonphotosensitive resin is preferably 40 90 by weight of the gross weight. Of methods for coating the photosensitive layer, there may be mentioned dip coating, roller coating, revolving coating, air knife coating and spray coating. The density of the coating solutions is determined in accordance with coating method, coating conditions, amount to be coated and the like. With the purpose of improving upon the so called clearing properties a water soluble compound layer or a water soluble photosensitive layer may be included as a subbing layer between the support and the photosensitive layer, however, if the amount of said subbing layer coated is too great, the preservability, stability and resolving power can be affected adversely. The amount of said subbing layer is preferably not more than 80 by weight of the amount of said photosensitive layer. More preferred lithographic printing plate materials of this invention comprise a photosensitive layer containing an oil soluble diazo resin and said nonphotosensitive resin directly on the support. A filler is desirably included in the coating solution for a photosensitive layer. We have found that the water developability can be improved by adding a filler into the photosensitive layer. The reason for this is not clear but it is believed to be due to the fact that an unexposed area in the photosensitive layer is softened more, when developed with water, because the intermolecular force between the resins of the photosensitive layer is weakened by the addition of said filler. Preferred fillers are those capable of transmitting an activated ray of light and of being inactive against an oil soluble diazo resin or a non photosensitive resin.More specifically, suitable inorganic fillers include asbestos, alumina, attapulgite, kaolin clay, finely powdered silicic acid, diatomaceous earth, titanium oxide, silicon oxide, quartz powder and talc, other suitable fillers include organic pigments of a phthalocyanine, a dioxazine or an anthraguinone dye or a hydrophobic polymer dispersed in an organic solvent as described in Japanese PatentPublication Open to Public Inspection No 149 326 1980. The above mentioned filler suitably has a grain diameter of 1 T lOo y, preferably 1 mji 10 . Also fillers or pigments which are dispersed in an organic solvent using the aforesaid non photosensitive resin as a dispersion protector can be used. The amount of said filler is generally 1 to 60 by weight of the gross weight of the photosensitive layer, preferably 3 to 45 by weight thereof. In order to improve the ink receptivity, a polyalkyl acrylate such as polyethyl acrylate, polypropyl acrylate, polybutyl acrylate or polyoctyl acrylate, a polyalkyl methacrylate such as polyethyl methacrylate, polypropyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate or polyoctyl methacrylate, a resin in which an alkyl phenol is condensed with formaldehyde of which the alkyl group is, say, an ethyl, propyl, butyl or octyl group , for example, may be incorporated into the photosensitive layer to serve as an ink receptive ingredient. The amount added is adjusted so that the water developability is not harmed in relation to the moisture sorption ratio of the non photosensitive resin and the amount added. The photosensitive layer used in this invention may contain an azide group containing polymer, a photosensitive polymer having a crosslinkable group of the formulaEMI13.1 R hydrogen atom, cyano group, halogen atom in a main chain or a side chain thereof. The photosensitive layer can contain a variety of additives as occasion demands. It is also possible to add an exposed image visualizer for visualizing an image exposed to light such as an acridine dye, cyanine dye, merocyanine dye, styryl dye or triphenyl methane dye the aforesaid organic pigments of a phthalocyanine, dioxazine or anthraquinone dye a combination of a leuco dye with an aromatic azide, carbonyl aside, sulfonyl azide or polyhalomethyl compound, a spiropyrane compound which changes color on exposure to light as described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No 6413 1969, for example. The amount added depends on the degree of object visible image but is in the order of 1 5 by weight of the gross weight of the photosensitive layer. When using an organic pigment to serve as 2 tiller, said exposed image visualizer is usually not required.Again, a stabilizer, a surface active agent, a plasticizer, a thickened or a levelling agent, for example, can also be added. The photosensitive layer of this invention forms a hydrophobic resin image through water development after image exposure to light. The light source to be used for image exposure is one having a photosensitive wavelength which corresponds to those of the photosensitive layer, in general it has a wavelength from 300 pstt to 450 rim. For example, a mercury lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a xenon lamp or a metal halide lamp may be used. The exposed area in the photosensitive layer is not removed when water development is carried out, while the unexposed area is easily removed off when its surface is rubbed softly with an absorbent cotton or a sponge, for example, and thus a lipophilic and hydrophobic resin image is formed on the support. The following Examples further illustrate the present invention. The moisture sorption ratio indicated was obtained at a relative humidity of 80 . EXAMPLE 1 The surface of 3S aluminium plate 0.24 mm thick was scoured by means of a nylon brush and pumice 400 mesh suspension liquid, and was then washed with water, and then was etched with a 10 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 500C for twenty seconds. A desmat treatment was applied to the plate thus etched by dipping it in 30 nitric acid solution at room temperature for twenty seconds, and an anodizing treatment was further carried out using a sulfuric acid solution at 40 C, a voltage of 10V and a current density of 2A dmê for five minutes. Then, a sealing treatment was applied by dipping it in a 5 sodium silicate aqueous solution for 5 minutes at 80 C .The graininess of the aluminium plate obtained was Rz 4 5 DIN and the coating obtained by anodizing treatment amounted to 15 mgAL 2 The following composition was coated on the aluminium plate mentioned above with a rotary coating machine thereafter it was dried at 550C for one hour, and a lithographic printing plate material was thus obtained.The amount of coating of thus obtained photosensitive layer was 27 mg urn EMI15.1 By wtHydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate moisture sorption ratio 8.3 80 parts Oil soluble diazo resin Hexafluoro phosphate salt of p diazo diphenyl condensed with paraformRldehyde SO partsCopper phthalocyanine pigment dispersed in methyl cellosolve ethylene glycol monomethyl ether to make 10 solution 100 partsMethyl cellosolve 810 parts A halftone dot original of 150 lines inch was brought into close contact with the aforesaid lithographic printing plate material and exposed to the light of an Idlefin 2000 , a 2RW metal halide lamp, mfd.by Iwasaki Electric Works at a distance of one meter for 40 seconds, and thereafter dipped in water at about 18 C for one minute and then rubbed softly, to carry out the development. As a result, an excellent printing plate was obtained in which the une osed area had been removed and the halftone dots were reproduced from fidelity from 3 to 97 . This printing plate was set in a Romori Sprint L 25B offset printing machine and then printing was carried out using Ultra King printing ink, mfd by Toyo Ink Co. As a result, not less than 50 000 excellent prints with a rich ink density were obtained without plate blinding, because the printing ink receptivity thereon was excellent. EXAMPLE 2 The following composition was coated in the same manner as in Example 1 on the same aluminium plate used inExample 1, and a lithographic printing plate material was obtained. Photosensitive liquid By wtEMI16.1 Copolymer of styrene methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate acrylic acid 30 10 20 40 Moisture sorption ratio 16 52 parts O soluble diazo resin The same as in Example 1 38 partsCopper phthalocyanine pigment The same as in Example 1 100 partsMethyl cellosolve 810 parts The coating of the photosensitive layer after drying was 28 mg dm2 by weight. Similar to the case of Example 1, exposure to light and the development were carried out the plate was then set in a printing machine, and a number of excellent prints were obtained. Separately, a lithographic printing plate material which had been coated and dried was kept for ten days at 550C at a relative humidity of 3 4 , and then the exposure to light, development and printing were successively carried out. As a result, a number of excellent prints were obtained similar to those obtained with the printing plate which had not been kept. CONTROL EXAMPLE 1 As indicated in Japanese Patent Publication Open toPublic Inspection No. 120028 1980, a photosensitive liquid of the following composition containing a photopolymeric compound as the principal component was coated and dried in the similar manner to Example 1, a lithographic printing plate material was thus prepared.

In a similar manner to that in Example 1, a printing plate was prepared after exposure to light and development when it was set in a printing machine, a number of prints with rich ink density were obtained. Separately, as in Example 2, a lithographic printing plate material that had been coated and dried was kept for ten days at 550C and at a relative humidity of 3 4 , and then exposure to light and development were successively carried out it was found that the developability of the unexposed areas was inferior and that scumming was caused in the printing operation.Consequently, it is apparent that the plate of Example 2 i.e. an embodiment of the inventionfis superior in preservability. EXAMPLE 3 Coating and drying were carried out using the photosensitive liquid of the following composition, in a similar manner to that used in Example 1 Photosensitive liquid By wtEMI19.1 Copolymer of styrene hydroxyethyl methacrylate butylacrylate acrylic acid 25 40 25 10 Moisture sorption ratio 8 70 partsResin in which p octylphenol is condensed with formaldehyde 10 partsOil soluble diazo resin The same as in Example 1 10 partsCopper phthalocyanine pigment The same as in Example 1 100 partsMethyl cellosolve 810 parts As in the case of Example 1, a negative film was brought into close contact therewith and the whole exposed to light. After being dipped in water at a temperature of 180cm the non image areas were removed by rubbing softly for one minute with absorbent cotton. Excellent prints were obtained of the original from the plate with fidelity and without any scumming.
