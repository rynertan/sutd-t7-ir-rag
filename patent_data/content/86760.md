# Mixed phenyl mesityl phosphate ester composition.

## Abstract
A mixed phenyl mesityl phosphate ester composition that is useful as a fire retardant additive, having a phosphorus con tent of from about 8.2 to about 8.4 is prepared by reacting with agitation at about 120 C to 130 C distilled still bottom phenols with phosphorus oxychloride in the presence of a Friedel Crafts catalyst to form a reaction product containing a substantial quantity of monoaryl phosphodichloridate and diaryl phosphochloridate. This reaction product is then further reacted at an elevated temperature with sufficient phenol to form a triaryl phosphate ester mixture. The mixed phenyl mesityl phosphate ester so obtained remains a liquid at room temperature over a substantial period of time.
