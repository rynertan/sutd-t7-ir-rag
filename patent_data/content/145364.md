# Conduit coupling assembly.

## Abstract
A conduit coupling assembly 20 for connecting the end portions 24, 26 of two lengths of conduit 28, 30 in coaxial, abutting relationship. The coupling assembly 20 includes an abutment ring 36 , an outer coupling 38 , re tainer means 52, 54 and resilient means 56, 58 . The ring 36 has an internal thread 40 sized for threading onto the end portion 24, 26 of one of the lengths of conduit 28, 30 . The coupling has a first end 42 and a second end 44 with a bore 46 extending therebetween sized to slidably, rotat ably receive the abutment ring 36 . The coupling first end 42 has an inside dimension smaller than an outside dimen sion of the ring 36 so that the ring 36 is unable to move past the first end 42 , and the first end 42 is provided with an internal thread 48 sized for threading onto the ends 24, 26 of the lengths of conduit 28, 30 . The retainer means is carried by the outer coupling 38 adjacent its second end 44 for preventing escape of the ring 36 from the bore 46 . The resilent means 56, 58 is disposed between the abut ment ring 36 and the coupling first end 42 and serves as a one way coupling device to install the ring 36 on one length of conduit.
