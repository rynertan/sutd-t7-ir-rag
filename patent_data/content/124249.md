# A RECEPTACLE FOR MOUNTING IN A FREEZER FOR ASSISTING IN THE DEFROSTING THEREOF

## Abstract
A receptacle 1 for a freezer 2 is disclosed. The receptacle or container 1 comprises a flexible polymeric material having the shape and contour of the freezer 2 so that by an appropriate attachment means, the container 1 may be inserted into the frost free freezer 2 and the freezer 2 used in a conventional manner. Frost will build up on the container 1 rather than on the walls of the freezer 2 . Accordingly, when it is necessary to defrost the freezer 2 , the contents are removed, the container 1 is removed and immediately replaced with a similar container or the removed container 1 may be flexed to remove the frost therefrom and replaced in the freezer 2 . The defrosting opera tion may be carried out in a matter of minutes as distinct from hours as heretofore.
