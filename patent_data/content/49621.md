# SEPARATING RODS OR BARS IN ROLLING MILLS

## Abstract
A batch of rods 66 being delivered to a shearing device in a rolling mill is supported an a helical spring 48 extending transverse to the direction of movement of the rods. When the spring 48 is stretched by extending piston cylinder units 56 , the rods are separated by an amount substantially equal to the pitch of the grooves in the shear knives.
