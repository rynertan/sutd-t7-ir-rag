# Apparatus for cleaning a record disc.

## Abstract
A cleaning apparatus for a record disc 17 comprises a support member 10 having a top side 11 and a bottom side 12 . Locating means 13, 15 is provided for locating the sup port member relative to the centre of a record disc 17 . A knob 40 is mounted on the top side of the support member for rota tion about an axis offset from the locating means whereby the support member may be manually rotated about the centre of the record disc 17 . A holder 24, 25 for a cleaning pad 35 is mounted on the bottom side of the support member also for rotation about an axis offset from the locating means. A drive mechanism 43, 22, 23 comprising a step up gear is provided to couple the knob 40 and the pad holder together such that rotation of the knob relative to the support member causes rotation of the pad holder relative to the support member. The knob 40 is hollow and the drive mechanism comprises a cir cular set of teeth 43 arranged around the internal periphery of the knob coaxially with the axis of rotation of the knob, and a gear wheel 22 fixed relative to the pad holder coaxially with the axis of rotation of the pad holder, the gear wheel being driven by the teeth 43 on the internal periphery of the knob. The cleaning pad 35 has a circular cleaning portion 37 which in use imparts a generally radially cleaning action on the record disc 17 .
