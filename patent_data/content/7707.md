The diketo alcohols wherein Y is N are disclosed in British Patent Application No 50936 77, the disclosure of which document being incorporated herein by reference. The diketo alcohols of general formula II may be made by reacting a compound of general formula III EMI6.1 where Y and R1 are as defined above, with a compound of general formula IV EMI6.2 where R2 is as defined above, in the presence of a base e.g. sodium methoxide or N methylaniline magnesium bromide . The compounds of general formula III and IV may be made by methods set out in the literature. The functional derivatives, salts, metal complexes, ethers and esters of the compounds of general formula I can be prepared from the latter in known manner. For example, the complexes can be made by reacting the uncomplexed compound with a metal salt in a suitable solvent. The substituent on the phenyl group in the compound of general formula I can often be changed by methods known in the art. For example, a compound wherein for example R is phenyl substituted with carboxy can be prepared from the corresponding compound whereinR is phenyl substituted with alkoxycarbonyl, and viceversa. The compounds are active fungicides, particularly against the diseases Piricularia oryzae on ricePuccinia recondita, Puccinia striiformis and other rusts on wheat, Puccinia hordei, Puccinia striiformis and other rusts on barley, and rusts on other hosts e.g. coffee, apples, vegetables and ornamental plants Plasmopara viticola on vinesErysiphe graminis powdery mildew on barley and wheat and other powdery mildews on various hosts such asHelminthosporium spp. on cereals, Sphaerotheca fuliginea on cucurbits e.g. cucumber , Podosphaera leucotricha on apples and Uncinula necator on vinesCercospora arachidicola on peanuts and other Cercospora species on for example sugar beet, bananas and soya beansBotrytis cinerea grey mould on tomatoes, strawberries, vines and other hostsPhytophthora infestans blight on tomatoesVenturia inaequalis scab on apples Some of the compounds have also shown a broad range of activities against fungi in vitro. They have activity against various post harvest diseases on fruit e.g.Penicillium digatatum and italicum on oranges andGloeosporium musarum on bananas . Further some of the compounds are active as seed dressings against Fusariurn spp., Septoria spp., Tilletia spp. i.e. bunt, a seed borne disease of wheat , Ustilago spp., Helminthosporium spp. on cereals, Rhizoctonia solani on cotton andCorticium sasakii on rice. The invention compounds also display plant growth regulating activity. The compounds may be used as such for fungicidal purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides also a fungicidal composition comprising a compound of general formula I or a salt, complex, ether or ester thereof as hereinbefore defined, and a carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combating fungal diseases in a plant, which method comprises applying to the plant, to seed of the plant or to the locus of the plant or seed a compound or functional derivative, salt, metal complex, ether or ester thereof or an isomer of any of the foregoing as hereinbefore defined. The compounds, salts1 complexes, ethers and esters etc., can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, or they can be applied also to bushes and trees, to seeds or to other medium in which plants, bushes or trees are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition.The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, keiselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum,Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler.Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers e.g. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, e.g. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a microencapsulated form. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers e.g. nitrogen , potassium or phosphoruscontaining fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound, are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound.The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising the compound of general formula I or a salt, metal complex, ether or ester or any isomer of any of the foregoing. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants e.g. wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s . These agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents.Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as alkyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins.. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s .These concentrates suitably contain organic acids e.g. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, e.g.compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal or compounds having herbicidal, plant growth regulating or insecticidal activity. The other fungicidal compound can be for example one which is capable of combating ear diseases of cereals e.g. wheat such as Septoria, Gibberella and Helminthosporium spp., seed and soil borne diseases and downy and powdery mildews on grapes and powdery mildew and scab on apple etc. These mixtures of fungicides can have a broader spectrum of activity than the compound of general formula I alone further the other fungicide can have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activity of the compound of general formula I .Examples of the other fungicidal compounds are imazalil, benomyl, carbendazim BCM , thiophanate methyl, captafol, captan, sulphur, dithiocarbamates, carbathiins, copper oxychloride, triforine dodemorph, tridemorph, dithianon, pyrazophos, binapacryl, quinomethionate, panoctine, furalaxyl, aluminium trio ethyl phosphonate , DPX3217, ethirimol, dimethirimol, bupirimate, chlorothalonil and metaxanine. The compound of general formula I can be mixed with soil, peat or other rooting media for the protection of plants against seed borne, soil borne or foliar fungal diseases.

The techniques employed were as follows The plants were grown in John Innes Potting Compost No. 1 or 2 in 4cm diameter mini pots.A layer of fine sand was placed at the bottom of the pots containing the dicotyledonous plants to facilitate the uptake of test compound by the roots. The test compounds were formulated either by bead milling with aqueous Dispersol T or as a solution in acetone or acetone ethanol which was diluted to the required concentration immediately before use.For the foliage diseases, suspensions 100 ppm active ingredient were sprayed on to the foliage and applied to the roots of the same plant via the soil. Exceptions were the tests on Botrytis cinerea and Venturia inaequalis, in which the compound was sprayed on to the foliage only.Sprays were applied to maximum retention and root drenches to a final concentration equivalent to approximately 40 ppm a.i. dry soil. Tween 20, to give a final concentration of 0.05 was added when the sprays were applied to cereals. For most of the tests the compound was applied to the soil roots and to the foliage by spraying one or two days before the plant was inoculated with the diseases. An exception was the test on Erysiphe graminis in which the plants were inoculated 24 hours before treatment. After inoculation, the plants were put into an appropriate environment to allow infection to take place and then incubated until the disease was ready for assessment. The period between inoculation and assessment varied from four to fourteen days according to the disease and environment.
