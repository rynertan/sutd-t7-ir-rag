# Electrostatic toner composition.

## Abstract
A dry electrostatic toner composition containing a resin, a colorant or pigment, and an organic sulfate or sulfonate charge control additive of the following formula CHEM wherein R1 is an alkyl radical containing from about 12 carbon atoms to about 22 carbon atoms, and preferably from about 14 carbon atoms to 18 carbon atoms, R2 and R3 are independently selected from alkyl groups containing from about 1 carbon atom to about 5 carbon atoms, R4 is an alkylene group containing from about 1 carbon atom to about 5 carbon atoms, R5 is a tolyl group or an alkyl group containing from about 1 carbon atom to about 3 carbon atoms and n is the number 3 or 4. Such toners, especially when combined with carrier materials, are useful for causing the development of images in an electrophotographic system.
