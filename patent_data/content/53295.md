# MULTIFREQUENCY EDDY CURRENT TESTING DEVICE

## Abstract
The prior art of multifrequency eddy current instru ments has required a band pass filter to separate each individual frequency. The drawback of the above mentioned method is the requirement to change the bandpass filter if the inspection frequency is changed. This invention relates to a design that eliminates the requirement for a bandpass filter. The aggregate of inspection frequencies are applied to linear multipliers which shift the information from one of the inspection frequencies to a base band signal. The information is then separated from the signals of other frequencies with a low pass filter. The advantage is that an inspection frequency may be changed by changing the oscil lator frequency only.
