## Description
The present invention relates to a method for making spectacles frames. As it is known such a frame comprises a front portion, generally consisting of two loop members joined by a bridge member, thereto two arms or rods are articulated. The mentioned parts are presently made starting from different materials, each thereof is to be processed by determined operating methods. These methods are in general carried out by using very expensive and cumbersome apparatus, under the supervision of skilled personnel, which apparatus are to be subjected to an extensive maintenance, thereby causing the cost of the produced frame to greatly increase. Accordingly, the task or the present invention is to overcome the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks, by providing such a method tor making spectacles frames which may be carried out by simple apparatus and or tools. Within that task, it is a main object of the present invention to provide such a spectacles frame making method which may be carried out in a very simple way, without requiring supervision by skilled personnel. Another object of the present invention is to provide such a spectacles frame making method which may be carried out by apparatus free of maintenance problems. According to one aspect of the present invention the above task and objects, as well yet other objects idlich will become more apparent thereinafter, are achieved by a methoa for making spectacles frame, characterized in that it provides for the use of open molds,made or a silicone rubber material, therein there are formed the pattern, of the spectacles front portion and arms to be obtained,said patterns or impressions being provided for receiving a mixture of at least two epoxy resins, including a hardener agent. Further characteristics and advantages of the method for making spectacles frames according to the present invention will become more apparent thereinafter from the following detailed description or a preferred embodiment thereof, with reference to the accompanying drawing, where fig.l illustrates, by way of an example,a mold for forming a spectacles front portion according to the invention and fig. 2 illustrates, also by way of an example, a mold for forming two spectacles arm or rod members. With reference to the numbers of the figures of the accompanying drawing, the method for making spectacles frames according to the present invention provides for the use of at least a first mold 1, therein the pattern or impression or a spectacles front portion 2 is formed, and at least a second mold 3, therein the pattern or impression of an arm pair 4 is formed, the configuration or shape of the arms asp ending on the configuration of said front portion. The mentioned molds, in particular, are made starting from very soft and resilient materials, such as closed cell roamed materials or, preferably, a silicone rubber material. Into the mentioned impressions there are poured or cast epoxy resins, as obtained fromEpichloridrine or Bisphenol A, or epoxy cremol Novolac resins, or epoxy phenol Novolac resins as additivat eQ by suitable haraener agents such as, polyamines, polyaminic amides,polyphenols,polycarboxylic acids, and so on. A preferred formulation of the above mentioned resins, to be cast into the open molds, provides, according to the invention,that,for producing the spectacles front portion, the rollowing components be mixed by weight 50 parts of CY 221 Araldite CIBA 50 parts of BRL Araldite CIBA 30 parts of Euredur 40 Shering For making the spectacles arms, on the other hand, the following components are used also by weight 50 parts of CY 221 Araldite CIBA 50 parts of DER 331 U.C.E 30 parts of Euredur 40 Shering It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the proauced spectacles front portions and arms will be hinge coupled by means of known members and methods, to provide finished spectacles frames. From the above disclosure and the rigures of the accompanying drawings it will be apparent that the invention Sully achieves the intended objects. While a preferred embodiment of the method for making spectacles frames has been thereinabove disclosed and illustrated, it should be noted that this embodiment is susceptible to several modifica tions and variations all thereof come within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined in the accompanying claims.
