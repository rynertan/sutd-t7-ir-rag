## Description
THRUST BEARING. The invention relates to thrust bearings which comprise two coaxial races positioned on opposite sides of bearing means. It is often required that a fully sealed thrust bearing is provided and this has commonly been achieved by positioning annular metal discs on the axially outwardly facing sides of the races and connecting the discs together by means of rubber elements. This construction is complex and expensive in view of the number of components which are required. In accordance with the present invention, a thrust bearing comprises two coaxial races positioned on opposite sides of bearing means and an annular, onepiece element.of resilient material which surrounds the races, has an axially outwardly facing sealing surface, and has integral, axially opposed, radially inwardly facing flanges which retain the races against axial outward movement. The use of a one piece element considerably simplifies the construction of the bearing with a corresponding decrease in the cost of construction. Preferably,two axially opposed swing surfaces are provided by the element and the or eachsurfa maybe fined by an axiRy outwardly projecting, annular rib which seals against a part of the assembly in which the bearing is mounted, in use. Thus, as the bearing is mounted into a supporting assembly, parts of the assembly will abut and seal against the or each projecting rib, the corresponding flanges being urged towards the races at which point the bearing is sealed.This enables the bearing to be made without the need for precise tolerances. Preferably, the resilience of the element is such that the element can be distorted to provide compressive resistance against the respective abutting part of the assembly to improve the seal. It is also convenient if each flange has substantially the same radial dimension so that the races can be pushed into the element from either end. The element may be made from a plastics material but is preferably made from. rubber. The bearing means may be any conventional type such as ball, roller, needle roller, or plain, and these bearing elements may be caged or uncaged. An example of a sealed thrust bearing in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross section through the bearing and, Figure 2 is a cross section through a king pin assembly incorporating the thrust bearing shown inFigure 1. The bearing shown in Figure 1 comprises two ste el bearing rings 1, 2 positioned on opposite sides of a bearing element 3. The bearing element 3 may comprise plain, ball, roller, or needle roller bearings which may be of the caged or uncaged types. The bearing rings 1, 2 Ã¨tained in position by means of an annular, one piece plastics band 4. The band 4 has two annular,radially extending, integral flanges 5 which are located in a corresponding pair of annular notches 6 provided on the bearing rings 1,2. The band 4 also has two axially extending, projecting ribs 7 which provide respective sealing surfaces 8. The flanges 5 retain the bearing rings 1, 2 against axial displacement. Figure 2 illustrates the thrust bearing shown in Figure 1 mounted in a king pin assembly. The assembly comprises a support yoke 9 having a pair of opposed bores 10, 10 . Two bushes 11,11 are mounted in the bores 10, 10 respectively. A king pin 12 extends between and into the bushes 11,11 and a thrust bearing in which it is rotatably mounted. The king pin 12 also extends through a bore 13 in a beam 14 to which it is non rotatably attached by means of a cotter pin 15. An upper surface 16 of the beam 14 is sealed to the support yoke 9 by a lip seal 17. A lower surface as seen in the drawing 18 of the beam 14 abuts against a bearing surface 19 of the steel bearing ring 1 of the thrust bearing shown in Figure 1. The surface 18 also abuts against the sealing surface 8 of the adjacent rib 7 of the band 4. This abutment seals the thrust bearing beam connection and the associated flange 5 of the band 4 is urged downwardly as shown in the drawing. The resilience of the band 4, however, is such that the flange 5 does not abut the steel ring 1. A lower bearing surface 20 on the steel ring 2 rests on a surface 21 of the support yoke 9. The surface 20 also abuts the sealing surface 8 of the adjacent rib 7 of the band 4 with which it seals and the corresponding flange 5 is urged towards the ring 2. Again, however, the flange 5 does not abut the ring 2. A pair of covers 22,22 are mounted in respective grooves 23,23 in the bores 10,10 respectively axially outwardly of the king pin 12.
