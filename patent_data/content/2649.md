## Description
1 DIMETHYL SUBSTITUTED ALKYL 2 OR 4 SUBSTITUTEDPHENYLIMIDAZOLES, THEIR PRODUCTION AND THEIR USEAS ANTI OBESITY AGENTS This application relates to 1 dimethyl substituted alkyl 2 or 4 substituted phenylimidazoles wliich are useful as anti ohesity agents. In particular, it relates to l dimetayl substituted alkyl 2 or 4 substituted phenylimidazoles and t cir pbarmaceutically accentable acid addition salts. The compounds of this invention may be represented by the following structural formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 and 2 each represent hydrogen, orEMI2.2 andR3 is hydrogen or fluoro, and n is 1, 2 or 3, and provided that one of R1 and R2 is other than hydrogen. The compounds of formula I may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI2.3 where X is halo having an atomic weight of about 35 to 127 orEMI2.4 wherein R4 is hydrogen, chlorine, or methyl, Z is sodium, potassium or lithium, and R1, R2, n and the proviso are as defined above. The compounds of formula I are prepared by treating a compound of the formula II with a compound of the formula III under an inert atmosphere preferably nitrogen in the presence of an incrt organic solvent. Although the particular solvent employed is not critical, the preferred solvents include the aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and the like, tlle ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydro furan and the like, dimethylacetamide an R dimethylformamide, the latter being especially preferred.The temperature of the reaction is not critical, but it is preferred that ttie reaction be carried out between about 150 to 60 C., preferably from about 200 to 300C. The reaction ma be run from about 8 to 36 hours, preferably from about 12 to 20 hours. The oro duct is recovered using conventional techniques, e.g., distillation or crystallization or when necessary, column chro matography followed by distillation or crystallization, The compounds of formulate II and III are known and may be prepared by methods described in the literature. It will be understood that the compounds of formula I may exist in the form of optically active isomers which can be separated alld recovered by conventional techniques, and such isomeric forms are also included within the scope of this invention. The compounds of formula I are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals. In particular, the compounds of formula I are useful as anti obesity agents in the treatment of obesity as indicated by preventing an increase in Ule blood sugar level in male Wistar rats in groups of 4 which are fasted for 16 hours and then are given an initial dose of 200 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight of the test compound orally. One hour later, the rats are given 2.5 grams per kilogram of animal body weight of starch load. Thirty minutes after administration of the starch, the rats are anesthetized with 120 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight of sodium hexobarbital after which blood is collected via cardiac puncture.The blood samples are placed in an autoanalyzer cup containing 0.1 milliliters of heparin 1,000 units per milliliter . The heaprinized blood is used to determine the blood sugar level with an autoanalyzer. The blood sugar content is compared to the control group which receives 0.5 carboxmethyl cellulose and are run concurrently. The blood sugar levels are calculated and compared to the control. For such usage, the compounds of formula I may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or adjuvant and may be administered orally or parenterally as such or admixed with conventional pharmaceutical carriers.They may be administered in such forms as tablets, disper sible powders, granules, capsules, syrups and elixirs, and parenterally as solutions, suspensions and the life, e.g., a sterile injectable aqueous solution. The dosage will vary depending upon the mode of administration utilized and the particular compound employed. d รง The.compounds of formula 1 may be similarly administered in the form of their non toxic pharmaceutically accept able salts. Such salts possess the same order of activity as the free base and are readily prepared by reacting the hase with an appropriate acid and accordingly, are included within the scope of this invention. Representative of such salts are the mineral acid salts such as the hydrochloride, llydro bromide, sulfate, phosphate and the like and the organic salts such as the succinate, benzoate, acetate, p toluenesulfonate and the like. The anti obesity effective dosage of active ingredient employed for tlie treatment of obesity may Vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition being treated. ITorzever, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of formula I are administered at a daily dosage of from about 2 milligrams to about 400 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight, p.o., preferably given in divided doses two to four times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 25 to about 1000 milligrams.Dosage forms suit able for internal use comprise from about 7.5 to about 500 milligrams of the active compound in intimate admixture with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. A representative formulation suitable for oral administration two to four times a day for the treatment of obesity is a capsule prepared by standard encapsulating tech niques which contains the following INGREDIENTS WEIGIIT mg. 1 3,7 dimethyloctyl 2 phenylimidazole 100 inert solid diluent starch, lactose, kaolin 200 EXAMPLE 1. 1 3,7 dimethyloctyl 2 phenylimidazole. To a solution of 21.5 q. 0.14 mole of 2 plienylimidazole in 60 ml. dry dimetiWlformamide and 300 ml. dry tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen atmosphere there is added at room temperature 9.0 g. 0.19 mole of 50 sodium hydride mineral oil suspension. The resulting mixture is stirred and heated to 50 C. for about 3 hours. After cooling to room temperature the resulting mixture is treated dropwise with a solution of 40.5 g. 0.18 mole of 1 bromo 3,7dimethyloctane in dry tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is stirred over night at room temperature and the resulting mixture is filtered and the residue washed with tetrahydro furan. The combined filtrate is concentrated in vacuo to an oil, the oil is then dissolved in methylene chloride, washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to yield an oily product.Distillation gave 1 3,7 dimethyloctyl 2 1 phenylimidazole b.p. 1500 to 1570C. at 0.2 0.16 mm. Following the above procedure and using in place of 2 phenylimidazole an equivalent amount of a 2 p fluorophenyl imidazole, or b3 4 phenylimidazole there is obtained a l 3,7 dimethyloctyl 2 p fluorophenyl imidazole or b l 3,7 dimethyloctyl 4 phenyl imidazole b.p. 1550 to 1650C at 0.2 mm respectively. Also following the above procedure and using in place of l hromo 3,7 dimethyloctane an equivalent amount of c l bromo 4,8 dimethylnonane, or d l bromo 5,9 dimethyldecane, there is obtained c l bromo 4, 8 dimethylnonane, or d l bromo 5, 9 dimethyldecane, there is obtained c l 4,8 dimethylnonyl 2 phenylimidazole, or d 1 5,9 dimethyldecyl 2 phenylimidazole, b.p. 142 148 at 0.7 mm. Also following the above procedure and using in place 2 phenylimidazole an equivalent amount of 4 phenylimidazole and using in place of l bromo 3,7 dimethyloctane an equivalent amount of l bromo 5,9 dimethyldecane there is obtained c 1 5,9 dimethyldecyl 4 phenylimidazole b.p. 1950 to 205IS at 0.5 mm. The I 1 3 ,7 dimethyloctyl 2 phenylimidazole of this example is an effective anti obesity agent when orally administered to an animal in need of said treatment at a dosage of 150 mg. two to four times a day.
