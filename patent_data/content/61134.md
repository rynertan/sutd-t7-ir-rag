# Improved polyvinyl chloride and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A particulate vinyl chloride polymer having excellent processability and heat stability which comprises porous vinyl chloride polymer particles and acrylic polymers which are included in the above porous particles. The particulate polymer is prepared by impregnating an alkyl acrylate in porous particles of a vinyl chloride polymer, polymerizing it, and in the course of the polymerization of the alkyl acrylate, adding an alkyl methacrylate to the polymerization system and continuing the polymerization. Since the thus obtained polymer has an improved melt flowability and heat stability, it can be blended with a large quantity of an inorganic filler and can be molded with good processability.
