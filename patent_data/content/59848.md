# FET and method for manufacturing such.

## Abstract
A field effect transistor and method of making the same are disclosed. A thick mesa 17 of dielectric material is grown on a semiconductor substrate 10 and two or more layers 20a, b 28a, b of polycrystalline silicon grown on the vertical sides of the mesa 17 serve a masking function to define the gate region of the transistor with high accuracy. The mesa 17 and the two or more polycrystalline layers 20a, b 28a, b remain in the final device.
