## Description
This invention relates to a method of, and apparatus for, melting and casting non ferrous metal according to the preambles of claim 1 and claim 9, respectively. The term metal is used herein to include non ferrous metal alloys. A widely used known method of making metal castings comprises the following main steps Sometimes a modified known method is used in which the metal is poured directly from the furnace into the mould, eliminating the transfer stage i.e. stage ii above . Less frequently, another modified known method is used in which after melting and pouring into a transfer ladle, metal is poured into a furnace or crucible contained within a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel is sealed and then pressurised by a gas which displaces the liquid metal up a riser tube and into the mould. This method of casting is called low pressure casting. It has the commendable feature that the pouring into the casting is replaced by an upward displacement which is much less turbulent than pouring under gravity. Correspondingly higher quality castings are produced than are produced with pouring under gravity. However, optimum quality is not attainable in oxide forming metals, such as those containing relatively large quantities of aluminium and magnesium, since surface oxides are entrained within the metal by the turbulence involved in the previous transfers carried out by pouring, and the entrained oxides do not separate quickly from the liquid. Most of the above described methods result in a total free fall of metal under gravity in one or two steps, occasionally more, through a vertical distance of from 0.50 metres to several metres. The resulting high metal velocities give rise to severe splashing and churning. In a rarely used known method, the metal is melted in a crucible or furnace connected directly to a mould, the crucible or furnace is then pressurised, or the mould subjected to partial evacuation, so that metal is forced or drawn up into the mould cavity directly. This method of casting eliminates all turbulence from transfers in casting and is therefore capable of making high quality castings in oxidisable alloys. Unfortunately, however, the method by its nature is limited to batch production. Also any treatment of the metal, such as de gassing by bubbling gases through the liquid, or fluxing by stirring in fluxes, involves the danger of residual foreign material suspended in the liquid metal. There is no intermediate stage in which such defects can conveniently be filtered out. The time usually allowed in consequence in an attempt to allow such impurities to sink or float prior to casting involves a considerable time delay and thus represents a serious reduction in the productivity of the plant. Another kind of casting system is described in GB A 1439875 in which a melting vessel is in constant and direct communication with horizontal passageways. It suffers from the disadvantages that impurities of the metal present in the melting vessel can easily be transferred into the distribution system and it is not possible to carry out treatment of the melt in the melting vessel because the necessary high temperatures and turbulence would cause even more particles to be transferred into the passageways and hence into the casting. All of these known methods therefore suffer from the problem of not providing high productivity together with high quality of castings. An attempt to provide a solution to the above problem is described in Engineering, Vol. 221, No. 3, March 1981, London GB , J. Campbell Production of high technology aluminium alloy castings pages 185 188 which forms the preambles of claims 1 and 9 respectively. This discloses a method of melting and casting non ferrous metal comprising the steps of melting metal in a melting vessel, transferring metal from the melting vessel into a launder and from there into a casting vessel by flow of metal under gravity and pumping metal against gravity from the casting vessel into a mould. However, whilst some improvement over previously known methods was experienced, as high productivity with high quality of casting as was desired was not achieved. The invention as claimed provides a solution to this problem by providing a method of melting and casting non ferrous metal comprising the steps of melting the metal in a melting vessel, intermittently transferring the metal from the melting vessel into a launder and from there into a casting vessel by flow of metal under gravity and pumping the metal against gravity from the casting vessel into a mould characterised by intermittently directing the metal from the melting vessel to fall freely into the launder at an entry end thereof, directing the metal from an exit end of the launder to a filter box disposed between the exit end of the launder and the casting vessel, directing the metal from the filter box into the casting vessel, maintaining metal in the launder with the top surface of the metal in the launder at a first level and the top surface of the metal in the filter box at a second level which are at or above the level of the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel whereby metal flows upwardly through a replaceable porous refractory filter element disposed in the filter box, maintaining the lowest level which the top surface of the metal in the filter box and the casting vessel reaches during normal operation above the bottom of the launder at the exit end, and maintaining the level of the top surface of the metal as the metal leaves the melting vessel above the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel by not more than 200 mm. The metal may be permitted to fall freely from the melting vessel onto an entry portion of the bottom surface of the launder which is more aligned with the direction of metal fall than is an exit portion of the bottom surface of the launder which lies substantially horizontally. Preferably, the level of the top surface of the metal as the metal leaves the melting vessel is maintained above the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel by not more than 50 mm. As a result, the metal flows gently from the melting vessel to the casting vessel without high metal velocities and hence without excessive turbulence. From another aspect, the invention solves the problem by providing in an apparatus for melting and casting non ferrous metal as described in the above referred to article and which comprises a melting vessel, a casting vessel, a pump to pump metal against gravity from the casting vessel into a mould, a launder to transfer metal from the melting vessel into the casting vessel by flow of metal under gravity, characterised in that the launder has an entry end located so that metal leaving the melting vessel intermittently falls freely to enter the launder thereat and an exit end whereby the metal may flow from the launder to a filter box, having a replaceable porous refractory filter element therein, positioned between the exit end of the launder and the casting vessel, means to direct metal from the filter box into the casting vessel, the launder being disposed to maintain metal in the launder with the top surface of the metal in the launder at a first level and the top surface of the metal in the filter box at a second level which are below the level of the top surface of the metal as it leaves the melting vessel and are at or above the level of the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel, for upward flow of metal through the filter element from the launder to the casting vessel, the launder and the casting vessel being disposed so that the bottom of the launder at the exit end is below the lowest level which the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel reaches during normal operation and the level of the top surface of the metal as the metal leaves the melting vessel being maintained above the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel by not more than 200 mm. Preferably the level of the top surface of the metal as the metal leaves the melting vessel is maintained above the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel by not more than 50 mm. The amount of oxide entrained increases with increase in said distance. Above 200 mm, the amount of oxide is significant in that it leads to a significant, i.e. an unacceptable deterioration in the properties of castings made from the metal. At 200 mm or below, whilst oxide may be entrained the amount is such that any deterioration in properties of castings made from the metal is tolerable. At 100 mm and below, there is still less deterioration in the properties of the resulting castings and at 50 mm and below there are no deleterious effects whatsoever on the castings in practical terms. The bottom surface of the launder may be horizontal or may be inclined so as to fall in the direction towards the casting vessel. The launder may have a bottom surface which is curved in longitudinal section to provide an entry portion which is more inclined to the horizontal than is an exit portion. As a result, metal leaving the melting vessel engages a part of the launder which is more nearly inclined to the direction of metal fall than other parts of the launder whilst the exit portion of the launder extends horizontally or substantially horizontally. This shape of the launder facilitates non turbulent flow of the metal. The metal may be transferred from the casting vessel into the mould by an electromagnetic type of pump or a pneumatic type of pump and preferably a pump as described in the description and drawings of GB A 2,103,132 the content of which is an integral part of the disclosure of this description. A pump of either of the above types has no moving parts and thus avoids any problem of turbulence during the transfer of metal from the casting vessel to the mould. The means to maintain the metal at said levels may include a holding furnace connected in communication with the casting vessel. Conveniently, the holding furnace comprises the casting vessel. The larger the surface area of the holding furnace, the larger the size and or number of castings which can be produced before the casting vessel requires to be topped up from the melting furnace to prevent the distance between said levels increasing to above maximum distance. Moreover, topping up of the casting vessel can occur without interruption to the casting cycle so that production can continue without variation in the rate of production. By providing a filter means any undesirable impurities in the metal may be removed from the metal before the metal enters the casting vessel. Thus treatment such as degassing, fluxing, grain refining, alloying, and the like can all take place in the melting vessel since any undesirable impurities resulting from such treatments are removed by the filter means so that the volume of metal from which the castings are drawn is exceptionally clean. In addition, the casting vessel which contains this clean metal also remains clean consequently reducing maintenance problems which are common with known installations. The melting vessel may be a lip action tilting type furnace arranged so that the lip is at a distance above the liquid metal in the launder, so that the maximum fall is less than said maximum distance. Such a height difference under conditions of controlled and careful pouring is not seriously detrimental to metal quality and any minor oxide contaminations which are caused may be removed for practical purposes by the above referred to filter means. If desired, more than one melting vessel may be provided to feed metal to the casting vessel either by each melting vessel feeding into a single launder or by feeding into separate launders or by feeding into a composite launder having a number of entry channels feeding to a common exit channel. It is desirable that all of the heating means of the apparatus be powered by electricity since the use of direct heating by the burning of fossil fuels creates water vapour, which in turn can react with the melt to create both oxides on the surface and hydrogen gas in solution in the metal. Such a combination is troublesome by producing porous castings. Such electrical heating means includes the heating means of the melting and holding furnaces. and all the auxiliary heaters such as those which may be required for launders. filter box units. and associated with the pump. It is also desirable that the melting vessels are of such a type as to reduce turbulence to a minimum. Resistance heated elements arranged around a crucible fulfil this requirement well. It is possible that induction heating using a conductive crucible and sufficiently high frequency might also be suitable. The control of turbulence at all stages in the life of the liquid metal from melting, through substantially horizontal transfer and holding, to final gentle displacement into the mould is found to reduce the nuclei for porosity whether shrinkage or gas to such an extent that the metal becomes effectively tolerant of poor feeding. Isolated bosses are produced sound without special extra feeding or chilling requirements. The invention is applicable to the casting of non ferrous metal, especially aluminium magnesium and alloys thereof. In general the level of porosity in aluminium alloy castings such as those of Al 7Si 0.5 Mg type, is reduced from about 1 vol. varies typically between 0.5 and 2 vol. to at worst 0.1 vol. and typically between 0.01 and 0.001 vol. . The castings produced by the present invention are characterised by a substantial absence of macroscopic defects comprising sand inclusions. oxide inclusions and oxide films. The presence of compact inclusions such as sand and oxide particles increases tool wear, so that castings produced by the invention have extended tool lives compared with those for equivalent alloys in equivalent heat treated condition. Oxide films cause leakage of fluids across casting walls, and reduce mechanical strength and toughness of materials. Thus castings produced by the invention have good leak tightness and have an increased strength of at least 20 for a given level of toughness as measured by elongation. Thus very high quality castings become attainable for the first time simultaneously with high productivity. Provided a high quality and accurate mould is used, and provided the alloy chemistry is correct, premium quality castings therefore become no longer the exclusive product of the small volume premium foundry, but can be mass produced. We have found that unexpectedly good results are obtained when a method and or apparatus embodying the invention is used to cast an aluminium alloy lying in the following composition range. In a preferred composition, the silicon, copper and magnesium contents may be as follows The alloy may be heat treated, for example, by being aged, for example, for one hour to eight hours at 190 C 210 C or by being solution heat treated, quenched and aged, for example, for one hour to twelve hours at 490 C 510 C, water or polymer quenched, and aged for one hour to eight hours at 190 C 210 C. The alloy may have the following mechanical properties where According to another aspect of the invention, we provide an article made by low pressure casting in an alloy lying in the above composition range and made by the method and or apparatus according to the first two aspects of the invention. An examination of the costs of the production of secondary aluminium alloys reveals that each element exhibits a minimum cost at that level at which it normally occurs in scrap melts. The cost rises at levels above since more has to be added, on average and below since the alloy has to be diluted with purer scrap or with expensive virgin or primary aluminium metal or alloy . The approximate minima for lowest cost are It will be seen that the levels of the constituents of an alloy according to the invention are substantially at the above indicated minimum cost level thereby being economical to produce. The principal alloying elements in an alloy embodying the invention are silicon which mainly confers castability with some strength. and copper and magnesium which can strengthen by precipitation hardening type of heat treatments. To obtain the desired ageing response on ageing. copper must be in excess of approximately 2.5 . An undesirable extension of the freezing range occurs with copper contents above 3.5 to 4.0 which detracts from castability and the incidence of shrinkage defects, porosity and hot tearing increases. A useful gain in strength is derived from the controlling magnesium levels optimally in the range 0.3 0.5 . Below this range strength falls progressively with further decrease in magnesium. Above this range the rate of gain of strength starts to fall significantly and at the same ductility continues to decrease rapidly, increasing the brittleness of the alloy. Titanium is normally added to increase mechanical properties in aluminium alloys but we have found unexpectedly that titanium is deleterious above 0.08 . The other alloying constituents are not detrimental in any significant way to the properties of the alloy within the range specified, the alloy thus achieves high performance. For good castability it is desirable that the alloy is of eutectic composition which provides a zero or narrow freezing range. The reasons for this include In an alloy according to the invention, a copper content lying in the range 2.5 to 4 and a silicon content of 10 to 11.5 provides a eutectic or substantially eutectic composition. At higher silicon levels primary silicon particles appear which adversely affect machinability. Thus the exceptionally good castability mentioned above is achieved. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Referring to the Figure, the apparatus comprises a melting vessel 10 comprising a conventional lip action tilting type furnace. The furnace is mounted for tilting movement about a horizontal axis 11 coincident with a pouring lip 12 of the furnace. Metal M is melted and maintained molten within a refractory line 13 within an outer steel casing 14. The furnace is heated electrically by means of an induction coil 15 and has an insulated lid 16. A ceramic launder 17, provided with a lid 18 having electric radiant heating elements 19 therein, extends from the lip 12 to a casting vessel 20. The casting vessel 20 comprises a holding furnace having a lid 21 with further electric radiant heating elements 22 therein and has a relatively large capacity, in the present example 1 ton. The casting vessel is of generally rectangular configuration in plan view but has a sloping hearth 23 to maximise its area at small volume extending towards the launder 17. Interposed between the launder 17 and the filling spout is a filter box 24 provided with a lid 25 having electric radiant heater elements 26. A weir 27 extends between side walls of the filter box 24 and has a bottom end 28 spaced above the bottom 29 of the filter box. A replaceable filter element 30 is positioned between the weir 27 and the downstream end wall 31 of the filter box and is made of a suitable porous refractory material. A pump 32 is positioned in relation to the casting vessel 20 so that an inlet 33 of the pump will be immersed in molten metal within the casting vessel and has a riser tube 34 which extends to a casting station so as to permit of uphill filling of a mould 35 thereat. When the apparatus is in use, as metal is pumped by the pump 32 to making a casting, the level L₂ of the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel 20 falls from a maximum height L₂ max. to a minimum height L₂ min. Metal M melted in the melting furnace 10 is poured therefrom into the launder 17 and hence via the filter 30 into the casting vessel 20 so as to maintain the level L₂ of the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel between the above described limits L₂ max. and L₂ min. The level L₁ of the top surface of the molten metal in the launder 17 is maintained at the same height as the level L₂ as is the level. L₃, in the filter box. The axis 11 about which the melting furnace vessel is tilted is positioned so that, in the present example, the top surface of the metal as it leaves the melting vessel is 100 mm above the minimum height to which it is intended that the levels L₁ min. L₃ min., should fall in use, so that even when the levels L₁ L₃ fall to the minimum predetermined value, the distance through which the metal falls freely is limited to 100 mm. Whilst a height of 100 mm is the distance in the above example, if desired, the distance may be such that during pouring the level of the top surface of the metal leaving the furnace is at a maximum distance of 200 mm above the levels L₁ min. L₃ min. but with some deterioration in casting quality whilst still presenting improved quality compared with known methods in general use. By providing the casting vessel with a relatively large surface area, the levels L₁ L₃ can be maintained within 50 mm of a predetermined mean height approximately 50 mm below the axis 11 since filling of a predetermined number of moulds, such as the mould 35, by the pump 32, does not cause the levels L₁ L₃ to fall outside the above mentioned range. In the present example, where the casting vessel has a capacity 1 ton 20 moulds each of 10 kilos capacity can be filled with a fall in level so that said distance increases from a minimum at 50 mm above the mean height to said maximum distance at 50 mm below said mean height before it is necessary to top up the casting vessel from the melting vessel 10. In the present example, approximately 1.5 hours of casting automobile engine cylinder heads can be performed before top up is necessary. Topping up of the casting vessel from the melting vessel 10 can be performed without interruption of the casting operation. The above described example is a process which is capable of high and continuous productive capacity in which turbulence and its effects are substantially eliminated and from which high quality castings are consistently produced. This is because the only free fall of metal through the atmosphere occurs over the relatively small distance from the lip 12 of the melting vessel into the launder 17 and in the present example, the maximum distance through which the metal can fall is 100 mm, although as mentioned above in other examples the maximum distance may be up to 200 mm which is a relatively small distance in which relatively little oxide is created and such oxide that is created is filtered out by the filter element 30. As mentioned above, the element 30 is removable and in the present example is replaced approximately at every 100 tons of castings, but of course the filter element may be replaced more or less frequently as necessary. In the present example the pump 22 is a pneumatic type pump as described and illustrated in the description and drawings of GB A 2,103,132 and to which reference is directed for a description of the pump. If desired, the pump may be of the electromagnetic type or any other form of pump in which metal is fed against gravity into the mould without exposing the metal to turbulence in an oxidising atmosphere. Although the melting vessel 10 has been described as being of the lip action tilting type furnace, other forms of furnace may be provided if desired, for example of the dry sloping hearth type heated by a radiant roof. In this case, the hearth terminates at a height which is at or less than said maximum distance of 200 mm so that although some free fall through the atmosphere occurs, it is not sufficient to create excessive turbulence. Irrespective of the nature of the melting vessel, if desired more than one melting vessel may be arranged to feed into the casting vessel either by feeding into individual launders or into a multi armed launder. In the example described above and illustrated in Figure 1, the launder has a bottom surface B which is below the lowest level L₂ min. to which the top surface of the metal in the casting vessel will fall in use and thus the launder 17 is maintained full of metal at all times during normal operation of the method and apparatus. However, if desired, and as illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 2, only part of the bottom surface Bc may be above this level L₂ min. In a still further alternative, the launder 17d may be of such configuration that the bottom surface Bd is curved in longitudinal cross section to present an entry part which is more inclined to the horizontal and an exit part which lies nearly horizontal as shown in Figure 3 or horizontal if desired . In this case, metal leaving the melting vessel first engages a part of the launder 17d which is more aligned with the direction of metal fall than other parts of the launder 17d, or is the case with the launders illustrated in the previous Figures, whilst the exit part of the launder lies substantially horizontal thus contributing to a relatively low metal velocity as metal leaves the launder and enters the casting vessel, as shown in Figure 3, below the level L₂ min. in the casting vessel 20e. The method and apparatus of the present invention are suitable for low melting point alloys such as those of lead, bismuth and tin those of intermediate melting points such as magnesium and aluminium and those of higher melting points such as copper, aluminum bronzes and cast irons. It is anticipated that steel may also be cast by the method and apparatus of the present invention although expensive refractories will be required. We have found that unexpectedly good results were obtained when the method and or apparatus described above was used to cast an aluminium alloy lying in the composition range specified above. An alloy having the following composition was made and tested This alloy was found to have excellent castability and it was found possible to make castings containing 3 mm thin webs and heavy unfed sections, all with near perfect soundness less than 0.01 volume percent porosity in cylinder head castings. cast at temperatures as low as 630 C. At these temperatures, power for melting is minimised and oxidation of the melt surface is so slight as to cause little or no problems during production. The tolerance of the alloy towards large amounts of Zn, and comparatively high levels of Pb and Sn is noteworth. The machinability of the alloy when sand cast by the process described hereinafter is found to be very satisfactory. Surface finish levels of 0.3 m are obtained in one pass with diamond tools. It qualifies for a Class B rating on the ALAR LMFA Machinability Classification 1982. No edge degradation by cracking or crumbling was observed edges were preserved sharp and deformed in a ductile manner when subjected to abuse. A DTD sand cast test bar of the above described alloy was made, by the process described hereinafter, and when tested was found to have the properties listed in Table 1 under the heading Cosalloy 2 where Line 1 gives the properties when the test bar was as cast , Line 2 when aged only at 205 C for two hours and Line 3 when solution treated for one hour at 510 C, quenched and aged for 8 hours at 205 C. Also shown in Table 1 are the mechanical properties of DTD sand cast test bars of a number of known Si, Cu, Mg type alloys namely those known as LM13, LM27, LM21 and LM4 in British Standard BS1490. Table 1 also shows the mechanical properties of DTD chill test cast bars of a number of other known Si, Cu. Mg type alloys. i.e. LM2. LM24 and LM26 which are available only as either pressure die casting or gravity die casting alloys. It will be seen that only the chill cast test bars approach the results achieved by the alloy above described which, is to be emphasised, was cast in sand. The test results stated in Table 1 with the alloy above described were achieved without recourse to modification, that is treatment with small additions of alkali or alkaline earth elements, such as sodium or strontium, to refine the silicon particle size in the casting. This treatment usually confers appreciable extra strength and toughness, although is difficult tc control on a consistent basis. The properties of the known alloys given in Table 1 have been achieved by this troublesome and unreliable method. The properties of the alloy above described were achieved without such recourse, and so having the advantages of being more reliable, easier and cheaper. It is believed that even better properties will be achieved with an alloy as described above a modified Table 2 shows results of further tests as follows In all groups, Cosalloy 2 was aged for four hours at 200 C and LM25 was solution treated for twelve hours at 530 C. polymer quenched and aged for two hours at 190 C. The results given in Table 2 are the average of a number of individual tests. When the tests which led to the results given in Group 1 were made, a standard mean deviation of less than 3 or 4 was observed. The tests of Groups 2 and 3 were intended to simulate conventional sand casting techniques and a standard mean deviation of up to 10 was observed. The figures given in Groups 2 and 3, because of the very great variability, are the average of tests which were performed with extreme care being taken during casting, and thus are indicative of the best results attainable by casting by hand. These figures demonstrate The test bars of the alloy embodying the invention and the test bars of LM25 referred to as made by casting uphill were cast using the method and apparatus described above. In this specification compositions are expressed in by weight.
