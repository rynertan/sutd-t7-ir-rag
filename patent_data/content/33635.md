# Cheese spreads and process for preparation of the same.

## Abstract
A packaged cheese spread is prepared by mixing a natural, soft to medium cheese with an edible fat, a stabilizer and water. During mixing the temperature is brought to a temperature of about 125 to 130 C at which temperature the mixing is continued for about 2 to about 10 minutes. The mixture is then cooled to about 75 to 85 C, homogenized and packaged in sealed containers. Cheese spreads prepared in this way have good shelf life and retain the original flavour of the natural cheese.
