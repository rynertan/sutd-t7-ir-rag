# Method for growing a single crystal of compound semiconductor.

## Abstract
Highly impurity doped single crystal often suffers from impurity precipitation. The cause of the occurrence of impurity precipitation is supposed to be the supercooling. To avoid the occurrence of supercooling the pulling speed is slowly lowered during the crystal growth in the LEC methods. The beginning of the occurrence of impurity precipitation is delayed by lowering the pulling speed. Additional application of magnetic field is more effective.
