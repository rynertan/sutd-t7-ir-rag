# Process and apparatus for mixing a gas and a liquid.

## Abstract
In a process for mixing a gas and a liquid in an apparatus comprising, in combination a a vessel 1 b a cylindrical hollow draft member 2 open at both ends and having a theoretical axis running from end to end, said axis being in a vertical position and the upper end of the draft member being conically flared 5 c an axial flow down pumping first impeller 6 fixedly connected to a rotatable shaft 3 , i the first impeller being positioned within the draft tube ii the shaft corresponding in position to the axis and iii the diameter of the helical impeller being less than, but proximate to, the diameter of the draft tube d first vertical baffling means 4 disposed above the impeller e means for rotating the shaft and f means for introducing the gas and the liquid into the vessel and for removing the gas and liquid from the vessel.
