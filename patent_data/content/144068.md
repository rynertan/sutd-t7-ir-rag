# DATA TRANSFER APPARATUS FOR USE WITH A MAGNETIC DISK CARTRIGDE

## Abstract
A data transfer apparatus employs a pair of magnetic transducer heads for contact with the opposite faces of a magnetic disk for data transfer. The magnetic disk is rotatably housed in a relatively rigid envelope to make up an interchangeable disk cartridge, with the envelope having a shutter openable to expose parts of the opposite faces of the magnetic disk for data transfer contact with the transducer heads. The apparatus has a cartridge cradle movable between a first position where the disk cartridge is loaded on and unloaded from the same, and a second position where the loaded disk cartridge engages with a disk drive mechan ism to be driven thereby. The cartridge cradle is dually locked against accidental travel from the first to the second position, in order to prevent the collision of the pair of transducer heads with each other. As the second locking mechanism, in addition to the first which is normally employed for latching the cartridge cradle in the first position, a lever for opening the shutter of the disk cartridge is adapted to positively lock the cradle in the first position even if the first locking mechanism is tripped accidentally.
