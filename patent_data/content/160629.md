# A method and system for controlling the apex flow of a multihydrocyclone for fiber suspensions.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of controlling an apex flow in a hydrocyclone unit 9 , and a control system for carrying out the method. The hydrocyclone unit 9 compris es a plurality of hydrocyclone separators 10 in parallel, and further comprises an inject chamber 21, 22, 23 , base chamber and apex fraction chamber common to all separ ators, an inlet 1 to the inject chamber 21 and an outlet 2, 3 for the base chamber 22 and apex chamber 23 respectively. The apex flow is controlled by automatically and substantially continuously detecting at a location in or adjacent the apex outlet 1 a flow parameter of the apex fraction, and comparing this sensed flow parameter value with a set point value, and changing the setting of a valve 15 incorporated in a conduit 14 connected to the apex outlet 2 when the sensed value deviates from the set point value, so that the flow parameter value of the apex fraction moves towards the set point value.
