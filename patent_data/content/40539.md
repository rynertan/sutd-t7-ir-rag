# Method of measuring by weighing.

## Abstract
A load cell 22 weighs an unknown quantity of used bank notes. A micro processor 24 receives a signal representative of the weight of the notes and processes the weight represen tative signals to obtain an output signal representing the value of the notes weighed, or generates a warning signal indicating that a reliable value of the notes cannot be derived. The note value or warning is given by a visual display panel 5. The processing means obtains the output by dividing the total weight of the used notes by the average unit weight of a used note, and comparing the quotient from that division with the nearest whole number to determine whether the quotient differs from the nearest whole number by 0.35. If the quo tient differs from the nearest whole number by less than the 0.35, the micro processor multiplies the said nearest whole number by the unit value of a note to give the money value of the notes weighed. If the said quotient differs from the said nearest whole number by more than 0.35, the micro processor generates the said warning signal.
