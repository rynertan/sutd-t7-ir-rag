## Description
PROCESS FOR REMOVING METALS FROM ALUMINOSILICATE MATERIALS This invention relates to a process for removing accumulated metals, particularly vanadium and nickel, from particulate aluminosilicate materials and to the aluminosilicate materials obtained by the process. The process may advantageously be used to remove accumulated metals from spent aluminosilicate contact materials used in selective vaporization processes of the type described in United StatesPatent 4,263,128. The process of this invention yields materials suitable for effective recycling to a selective vaporization unit or for ecologicallyacceptable disposal, as well as, optionally, recovery of metals in saleable form. United States Patent 4,263,128 discloses a selective vaporization process which reduces theConradson Carbon and metals content of heavy hydrocarbon feedstocks destined for catalytic cracking or oTher hydrocarbon conversion processes. Broadly, the selective vaporization system comprises a contactor, a burner regenerator and an inventory of circulating, fluidizable, essentially inert contact material. Rapid application of heat, generated within the burner and carried by the circulating inventory of inert contact material, selectively vaporizes most of the hydrocarbon components of the feed.During this selective vaporization, non vaporized components of the.feedstock, including metals, are deposited on the contact material. The spent contact material, bearing deposits of Conradson Carbon and metal components of the hydrocarbon feedstock, is then introduced into a burner regenerator where combustible portions of the deposited materials are oxidized. The contact material is then recycled to the contactor. Because contaminating metal deposits are not concurrently removed in the regenerator, the quantity of metal contaminants on a particle of contact material typically increases during each of its cycles through the selective vaporization unit. The accumulated metals that are deposited on the contact material during selective vaporization can have undesirable effects upon the properties ofThe material. For example, excessive quantities of vanadium on the contact material can cause the material to agglomerate in the selective vaporization unit.In practice, in selective vaporization processes, the metals content of the selective vaporization contact material has been held at acceptable levels by with drawing a portion of that material on a continuous or semi continuous basis and replacing it with fresh contact material. In order to maintain the overall efficiency of selective vaporization processes, it would be desirable to remove the metals from the contact material That is withdrawn from the selective vaporization unit and then to recycle the metalsdepleted contact material back to the selective vaporization unit. In addition, it would be desirable to recover the metals removed from the contact material in saleable form. The 128 patent discloses that the preferred contact material for selective vaporization comprises calcined kaolin clay, an aluminosilicate material. Metals which deposit and build up on the surface of such contact material during The selective vaporization step tend to combine chemically withThe material during The combustion step. Separation of those metals from the contact material is difficult, often leading to degradation of The material itself during the metals removal process. Metals extraction processes which lead to co extraction of alumina or silica are not useful in treating aluminosilicate materials, such as calcined kaolin clay, because such processes adversely affect the integrity of the materials. For example, approximately 90 vanadium recovery could be obtained by boiling the particles in 10 caustic soda but The particles are degraded and become essentially useless as a contact material thereafter. Decreasing the severity by lowering the temperature or concentration of caustic decreases the vanadium recovery significantly but the amounts of alumina and silica extracted are sufficient to interfere with subsequent liquid ion extraction processes for recovering the metal.As another example, strong mineral acids will extract nickel and vanadium from aluminosilicate contact materials, such as microspheres of calcined kaolin clay, but alumina is co extracted, leading to a reduction in the amount of material available for recycling, an undesirable increase in the surface area of the microspheres and decreased attrition resistance depending upon the amount of alumina extracted. The present invention is directed to a process for the effective reactivation of spent metal containing aluminosilicate contact materials used in selective vaporization processes and the recovery of accumulated metals, particularly vanadium and nickel, from those materials. In a preferred process of the invention, the vanadium and nickel are recovered in saleable form. An advantage of the process is that usually the integrity of the treated aluminosilicate contact material is not destroyed or unduly degraded physically or chemically, so that the product may be recycled to the selective vaporization unit substantially free of contaminating metals. Alternatively, the treated contact material may be disposed of in an ecologically acceptable manner. Broadly, the process of the present invention comprises a treating an aluminosilicate material contaminated with nickel and vanadium values with alkali chloride selected from lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and mixtures Thereof, in the substantial absence of moisture, at a temperature above the melting point of the chloride or chlorides, under conditions effective to convert the nickel and vanadium in the aluminosilicate material to soluble form and b removing soluble nickel and vanadium values from the treated aluminosilicate material. In a first embodiment of the invention, the alkali chloride is K or Li chloride, or a mixture of potassium chloride and lithium chloride. In this first embodiment, the nickel and vanadium values may be removed from the aluminosilicate material that is obtained in step a in a multi stage process comprising 1 contacting the aluminosilicate material with an aqueous liquid to obtain an aqueous extract of nickel chloride, 2 separating the aluminosilicate material from the aqueous extract of nickel chloride obtained in step 1 , and 3 treating the aluminosilicate material that is obtained in step 2 to remove the vanadium valuesTherefrom.Preferably, step 3 is conducted by contacting the aluminosilicate material with an aqueous solution of a base, such as an alkali carbonate, to obtain an aqueous extract comprising vanadium values or by contacting that material with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or mixtures Thereof. In a second embodiment of the invention, the alkali chloride is selected from potassium chloride, lithium chloride and mixtures thereof. In this embodiment, the nickel and vanadium values may be removed from the aluminosilicate material that is obtained in step a in a single stage process that comprises contacting that material with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or mixtures thereof, to extract the nickel and vanadium values from the aluminosilicate material. As mentioned above, the aluminosilicate material obtained by the process of the invention is suitable for use in a selective vaporization process of the type described in United States Patent 4,263,128. That material, after being treated by the process of this invention, is.characterized by an alumina to silica molar ratio of about 1 2, a mullite content of about 10 by weight, an alkali metal oxide content of at least about 1 by weight, the alkali metal oxide being present as an oxidic material selected from lithium aluminosilicate, potassium aluminosilicate and admixtures thereof, depending upon which alkali metal chloride is used in the roast. Tridymite and cristobalite may also be present. These phases may be determined by x ray diffraction. Figure 1 is a schematic outline of a first preferred embodiment of the process of This invention. Figure 2 is a schematic outline of another preferred embodiment of the process of this invention. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there are depicted two preferred embodiments of this invention. In each embodiment, the metal containing spent aluminosilicate contact material preferably was obtained from the charge of contact material utilized in a selective vaporization process of the type described in United States Patent 4,263,128.Preferably, the contact material had been withdrawn from the burner regenerator of a selective vaporization unit. Excess carbon borne by the contact material should be removed by calcining. Contact materials bearing carbon in an amount of less than about 0.04 by weight may be treated without precalcining but at a higher carbon loading, the contact material should normally be precalcined. The preferred aluminosilicate contact material that may be treated by the process of the present invention comprises metal contaminated microspheres of calcined kaolin clay obtained from a selective vaporization process of the type described in United States Patent 4,263,128. The microspheres of calcined kaolin clay that are utilized in such processes may be made, for example, by a process of the type described in United States Patent 3,663,165 Example 1, column 6, lines 44 57 . The chemical composition of the calcined kaolin clay microspheres that are preferably used in such selective vaporization processes generally corresponds to that of a dehydrated kaolin clay.Typically, the calcined microspheres analyze about 51 to 53 by weight SiO2, 41 to 45 by weight A1203 and O to 1 by weight H20 the balance including minor amounts of indigenous impurities, notably iron, titanium and alkaline earth metals. Iron content expressed as Fe203 and titanium content expressed as Tiro2 are, usually, respectively, 0.4 to 2.5 by weight, and up to 2 by weight. The term kaolin clay as used herein embraces clays, the predominating mineral constituent of which is kaolinite, halloysite, nacrite, dickite, anauxite and mixturesThereof. Figure 1 depicts a first preferred embodiment of the invention in which the nickel and vanadium values are removed from the aluminosilicate material separately. In the first stage of this embodiment, the aluminosilicate material is contacted with potassium chloride, lithium chloride, or mixtures thereof, and is thermally treated in the substantial absence of moisture. The thermal treatment may be conducted in air, nitrogen or another inert dry gas. The amount of moisture present in the gas should be lessThan about 1 , preferably less than about 0.5 , still more preferably less than about 0.1 of the weight of the contact material being treated. During the thermal treatment, the nickel values in the aluminosilicate material are converted into water soluble form.The heat treatment is preferably conducted at a temperature ranging from about 1450 to about 220o0F, most preferably from about 1750 to about 1950 F, for a time period from about 5 to about 60 minutes, preferably from about 10 to about 30 minutes. In the embodiment of Figure 1, after the first stage alkali chloride thermal treatment, the resulting mixture is contacted with an aqueous liquid under conditions sufficient to extract nickel values from the aluminosilicate material. For example, the mixture may be contacted with an aqueous liquid at 50 600C for 15 minutes. The resulting solid and liquid phases are separated, preferably by filtration and washing. The resulting aqueous phase includes extracted nickel, chlorine ions and alkali metal ions. The presence of iron suppresses the solubility of vanadium, and therefore if desired, iron may be added to the aqueous liquid if The iron content of the contact material is not sufficient to prevent co extraction of vanadium and nickel. The exact nature of the aqueous liquid used for extraction of the nickel chloride is not critical, as long.as contaminants contained therein do not interfere with dissolution of the nickel chloride, removal of vanadium and recovery of lithium, if a mixture of chlorides is used in the thermal treatment. The slightly acidic aqueous solution e.g., a pH of about 1.5 3 that results from the aqueous liquid extraction step may be treated by a number of techniques to remove the nickel values Therefrom. Thus it may be treated e.g. neutralized to a pH of about 8.0 , suitably with potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and or lithium carbonate, to precipitate hydrated nickel oxide. or nickel hydroxide or carbonate, which is then separated from the aqueous phase. The pH values of the solutions and slurries referred to herein are the pH values that those solutions and slurries would have at 250C. The precipitate that is separated in the process described in the preceding paragraph may then be heated to obtain nickel oxide. The aqueous phase from which the precipitate is separated contains alkali chloride and may be recycled for use in the alkali chloride thermal treatment step described above. Nickel values may be recovered from the solution that results from the aqueous liquid extraction step by a technique other than the precipitation technique described above. For example, the nickel ions may be removed by liquid ion exchange or electrolysis.Iron and vanadium may be co extracted along with nickel from the aluminosilicate material during the aqueous liquid extraction step described above. We have discovered that the amount of vanadium that is extracted during the aqueous liquid extraction step may be minimized by maintaining the iron content of the aqueous phase at a certain minimum level. In particular, the extraction of vanadium may be minimized by maintaining the iron content of the aqueous phase at a level of at least about 50 ppm by weight Foe203, preferably at least about 150 ppm by weight Fe2O3. The iron content may be maintained at these levels by utilizing high iron content aluminosilicate material e.g., metal contaminated calcined kaolin clay containing about 1.5 to 2.5 by weight Fe2O3 , by adding iron e.g., as ferric oxide to the aluminosilicate material before the thermal treatment step, or, preferably, by adding iron e.g., as ferric chloride to the aqueous phase during the aqueous liquid extraction step. Generally, if the pH of the aqueous liquid extract solution is greater than about 2.5, then in order to have a suitable iron content in the aqueous phase, ferric chloride may be added to reduce the pH to, preferably about 1.7 to about 2.3, most preferably about 2.3. It is preferred to add the iron as ferric chloride because it causes a comparatively small increase in the ferric oxide content of the treated contact material, with most of the iron remaining in the aqueous phase during the aqueous liquid extraction step. When the alkali chloride that is used in the first embodiment of the invention is a mixture of potassium chloride and lithium chloride, the weight ratio of KCl to LiCl is most preferably from about 1 1 to about 2 1, preferably from about 1.5 1 to about 1.7 1. In order to minimize extraction of vanadium in the aqueous liquid extraction step for removal of nickel, the weight ratio ofKC1 to LiCl is best at least about 1.2 1. The total weight of the alkali metal chlorides should preferably be at least about 10 , more preferably, about 15 of the weight of the contact material to be treated. Far larger amounts of the chlorides may be used if desired. In addition, the solids to aqueous liquid weight ratio in the aqueous liquid extraction should preferably be from about 1.5 1 to about 2 1. As depicted in Figure 1, the solid aluminosilicate material resulting from the aqueous liquid extraction step is subjected to an alkali extraction treatment to remove vanadium values from that material. In that treatment, the aluminosilicate material is contacted with an aqueous solution of an alkali selected from alkali hydroxide, alkali carbonate, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, in the alkali extraction step, the aluminosilicate material is contacted with an alkali carbonate solution, such as sodium carbonate or most preferably potassium carbonate, to extract the vanadium as soluble alkali vanadate. Preferably, the contact takes place at or near the boiling point of the alkali carbonate solution. The alkali carbonate solution used typically contains at least about 1.5 by weight alkali carbonate. When lithium chloride or a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride is used in the thermal treatment step, alkali acetate, a mixture of alkali carbonate and alkali acetate, or a mixture of alkali acetate and alkali hydroxide, at a temperature above the melting point of the alkali acetate, is preferably utilized as the alkali in the alkali extraction step, so that a substantial quantity of the lithium in the aluminosilicate material may be extracted therefrom. Substantial quantities of the lithium extracted from the aluminosilicate material may be recovered without adversely affecting the extraction of vanadium values from the material. After alkali extraction, the solid and liquid phases are separated, e.g., by filtration and washing. The metals depleted aluminosilicate material may then be dried and recycled for use in a selective vaporization unit. In those embodiments of the invention in which lithium chloride is utilized in the alkali chloride thermal treatment step described above, a substantial quantity of lithium, a relatively expensive material, becomes deposited on the aluminosilicate material. As described above, a substantial quantity of the lithium may be extracted from the aluminosilicate material by conducting the alkali extraction step in the presence of alkali acetate under a set of specified conditions. Alternatively, a substantial quantity of the lithium may be removed from the aluminosilicate material by contacting the material with alkali acetate material after the alkali extraction step.For example, the lithium could be extracted from the aluminosilicate material by a variation of the process for extracting lithium from B spodumene described in United States Patent 2,924,507, using potassium acetate in place of sodium acetate. Specifically, in such a variation, the aluminosilicate material is contacted with molten potassium acetate at a temperature of about 3240C and at ambient pressure, to obtain a molten material containing lithium acetate. The resulting lithium acetate containing material may be dissolved into an aqueous solution into which potassium carbonate is introduced to precipitate the lithium as lithium carbonate. After recovery of the solid lithium carbonate, the remaining potassium acetate solution may be utilized or disposed of in an appropriate way. The aqueous vanadate containing solutionThat is obtained from the alkali extraction step preferably is treated for recovery of vanadium.Vanadium recovery may be carried out by a. liquid ion exchange technique using a quaternary amine in the carbonate, sulfate or chloride form. In such a technique, the aqueous vanadate containing solution is contacted with the quaternary amine to extract the vanadate ions from the aqueous phase to the organic phase i.e., the quaternary amine phase . Quaternary amines that are useful in the liquid ion exchange step of the process are described in Australian Patent Specification 245,763. Such a material is commercially available, in the chloride form,. as Aliquat 336 Liquid Ion Exchange Reagent commat . In the most preferred embodiment of the invention, the quaternary amine that is utilized in the ion exchange step is Aliquat 336 Liquid Ion Exchange Reagents that has been converted to the carbonate form by treatment with alkali carbonate. Alternatively, the quaternary amine may be used in sulfate form, which is obtained by treating the quaternary amine with sulfuric acid. It is preferred to use the quaternary amine in its carbonate form, because the aqeuous phase resulting from the liquid ion exchange step may then be utilized, in whole or in part, as a feed stream to the alkali extraction step that was described above without introducing chloride ions into that step. The organic phase from the liquid ion exchange step may be stripped with an ammoniacal solution, such as an ammonia and ammonium chloride containing solution, for a time sufficient to precipitate substantial quantities of the vanadium as ammonium metavanadate. If ammonium ions are provided in the form of an aqueous alkaline solution other than an ammonia and ammonium chloride containing solution, e.g., an aqueous solution comprising ammonium carbonate and ammonium sulfate, the ammonium metavanadate is precipitated by evaporation of ammonia. Typically, the organic phase is contacted with the ammonia and ammonium chloride containing solution for a period from about 1 to about 5 minutes, at a temperature from ambient temperature to about 500C. Vanadium is recovered as solid ammonium metavanadate from the ammoniacal stripping step.The ammonium metavanadate may then be thermally decomposed to vanadium pentoxide. The organic phase from the ammonium stripping step may be reconverted to the carbonate form then recycled to the liquid ion exchange step. The aqueous raffinate resulting from the liquid ion exchange step is preferably recycled to the alkali extraction step. If the quaternary amine usea in the liquid ion exchange step was in the sulfate form, t is preferred to remove a portion of the sulfate from the aqueous raffinate before recycling it to the alkali extraction step to maintain the sulfate concentration.below about 60 g l.This may be accomplished by precipitating the sulfate as barium sulfate by adding an appropriate amount of barium carbonate to the aqueous raffinate. An advantage of the first embodiment of the invention described hereinabove is that nickel values can be extracted from the aluminosilicate material into an aqueous phase with no significant co extraction of vanadium and then vanadium values are extracted from the aluminosilicate material in a separate step. This sequential separation of nickel and vanadium can be less complicated and expensive than when it is required to separate vanadium and nickel values which have been co extracted from the alumino silicate material. Another advantage of the first embodiment of the invention is that it does not result in large amounts of liquid wastes. In particular, as described above, the liquid streams obtained in the first embodiment may be effectively. recycled, with resultant savings in material and disposal costs. In a different vanadium recovery procedure, after the nickel has been removed by extraction with water, the vanadium is removed by extraction with acid. Acid extraction may be accomplished by contacting the solid aluminosilicate material obtained from the water extraction step with an aqueous acid solution comprising sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or mixtures thereof. The resulting liquid phase, which contains vanadium values, may then be treated by liquid ion exchange processes to recover the vanadium therefrom, as described in United StatesPatent 4,126,663. The solid phase resulting from the acid extraction step may be treated as in the first embodiment described above. In a second embodiment of the invention, shown in Figure 2, the aluminosilicate material is contacted with potassium chloride, lithium chloride, or mixtures thereof, and heated under the same conditions described above in connection with the description of the alkali chloride thermal treatment of the first embodiment of the invention. Thereafter, the nickel and vanadium values in the aluminosilicate material are co extracted therefrom by contacting that material with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or mixtures thereof.Preferably, the contact occurs at a solids liquid ratio from about 1 1 to about 1 2 and at an elevated temperature e.g., boiling for from about 1 to about 3 hours in a closed vessel. The resulting solid and liquid phases are separated by filtration or centrifugation and then washed. The aluminosilicate solids may then be recycled. The aqueous phase, which contains extracted nickel and vanadium values, may be treated by liquid ion exchange for vanadium recovery.Alternatively, the aqueous phase may be neutralized and then treated by conventional methods for metals recovery or disposed of in any ecologically acceptable manner. When the acid reactant used in the extraction is hydrochloric acid, it is preferably used as a solution containing from about 10 to about 36 HCl by weight, preferably from about 15 to about 20 by weight and the solids liquid ratio should be about 1 1. The preferred reaction conditions include heating at or near The boiling point for from about 30 minutes to about 3 hours. When the acid reactant is sulfuric acid, it is preferably used as a solution having a concentration of up to about 70 by weight, preferably about a 40 70 solution, more preferably about a 45 60 solution and the solids liquid ratio should be about 1 1. The preferred reaction conditions include heating at or near the boiling point for at least about 30 minutes, preferably from about 45 minutes to about 2 hours. EXAMPLES The following Examples demonstrate various alternative embodiments of the process of the present invention, as well as the results of optimization studies carried out for each embodiment. TheExamples are set forth for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner In each Example, the following procedure was employed. Samples of spent aluminosilicate contact material microspheres of calcined kaolin clay as described above were obtained from the burners of selective vaporization units. The mullite content of these samples had increased to about 10 . In each Example, The spent aluminosilicate contact material was mixed with an alkali chloride solution, oven dried slowly to about 2200C and introduced into a substantially closed, electrically heated, Lindberg crucible furnace Model F 95454 .Thermal treatment was conducted in the presence of oxygen. Since the heating occurred in static air in a closed crucible, the moisture driven off during heating was not free to re enter the crucible. In Examples of the first embodiment, the thermal reaction pnihst was stirred and extracted with water solids liquid weight ratio 1 1.6 at a temperature of about 50 C to about 600c for abet 30 min to extract nickel chloride, filtered, washed and dried. In some Examples, the filter cake solid phase was further treated by extracting it with water and then by refluxing it with a 1.5 to 2 by weight alkali carbonate solution solids liquid weight ratio 1 2 for about 30 min to extract vanadium as soluble alkali vanadate. The resulting solid and liquid phases were separated and the metals depleted contact material, which was suitable for recycling to a selective vaporization unit, was analyzed for its metals content. Extraction of vanadate ions from the carbonate extracts was effected by shake out tests in separatory funnels using Aliquat 336 Liquid Ion Exchange Reagent9. The filter washes from both the alkali chloride treatment water extraction and alkali carbonate extraction were analyzed for their metals content.Example 1 Potassium Chloride Reaction Potassium Carbonate Extraction The procedure set forth above was employed using a 25 KC1 solution in the alkali chloride treatment step, in a proportion of 32 by weight of KCl based upon the dry weight of KNV J spent aluminosilicate contact material, and a 2 K2CO3 solution for the alkali carbonate extraction. The KNV J material had a vanadium and nickel content of 1.26 V and 0.22 Ni, by weight, as well as 0.02 C, 0.044 S, 0.47 Na2O, 54 SiO2, 2.43 Fe2O3 and 42 Al203. The resulting filter washes were analyzed for content of V, Ni and Na2O. Extraction efficiencies Mere calculated from final contact material filter cake analyses the small differences between these extractions and those based on filter analyses reflected volatilization losses. The results of these analyses are shown in Tables I and II.

These results demonstrate that vanadium and nickel extractions were relatively independent of reaction temperature and time in the range from about 180off to about 19500F and about 15 to about 30 min, with an average nickel extraction of about 67 and an average vanadium extraction of about 56 or a total nickel and vanadium metals extraction of 57 i 2 .About 15 , on average, of the vanadium extracted was volatilized, with no significant nickel volatilization. The use of KCl in the alkali chloride thermal treatment step provided virtually complete segregation of vanadium and nickel between the first water and the second carbonate extractions. The extracted aluminosilicate contact material showed no weight loss after the treatments and the small weight gains observed 1.6 to 6 were due to the K20 pick up, which increased with time and temperature of the treatments. About 50 to about 70 of the Na2 0 was extracted and this was largely independent of specific reaction conditions. This advantageously prevented sodium build up.Example 2 Potassium Chloride Lithium Chloride Reaction Potassium Carbonate Extraction This Example employed mixtures ofKCl and LiCl, in varying proportions relative to each other and relative to the weight of the KNV J spent aluminosilicate contact material. Analyses were carried out as in Example l and the results are shown in Tables III and IV. These results demonstrate that vanadium and nickel extractions were relatively independent of reaction temperature and time, in the range of about 18000F to about 1950S and about 15 to about 3Q min, with an average nickel extraction of about 79 and an average vanadium extraction of about 67 or a total nickel and vanadium metals extraction of about 69 to 70 . Fran about 16 to about 28 of the vanadium extracted was volatilized, with 16 to 18 volatilized at the preferred shorter reaction time. No nickel was volatilized. The function of KCl in the alkali chloride thermal treatment step was to facilitate segregation between the first and second extractions. As the proportion of KCl in The KCl LiCl mixture increased, there was no effect upon either the levels of vanadium or nickel extraction, although it decreased the Li2O loss into the contact material with some increase in K2O pick up. The extracted contact material showed a small weight gain, due toK20 and Li2O pick up.

The use of lithium chloride in the alkali chloride thermal treatment step incurs lithium replacement costs, due to Li20 pick up by the contact material. Li2O levels in the extracted contact material represent the need for make up lithium carbonate. Recovery of up to 80 to 90 of the Li2O from the extracted material is possible by treating the material with potassium acetate or sodium acetate before returning it to the selective vaporization contactor for recycling. Table V demonstrates the results of varying the KCl LiCl ratios at a fixed reaction temperature and time of 1900F and 30 minutes, respectively. The spent aluminosilicate contact material treated KNV H contained 1.34 V, 0.36 Ni and 1.55 Fe203 by weight. It was found That with a fixed KCl addition 24.4 , LiCl addition could be reduced from 20 to 15 without affecting the vanadium or nickel extraction efficiency and with the advantage of some reduction in lithium loss. With fixed LiCl addition,.although a 20 or 25 reduction in KCl addition did not significantly affect the levels of overall vanadium or nickel extraction, vanadium and nickel were no longer segregated between the water and carbonate extracts. Only in the cases where the KCl LiCl ratio was at least 1.2 1 was the vanadium substantially segregated into the second carbonate extract. At lower KCl levels, vanadium was distributed between the two extracts.

Example 3 Potassium Chloride Lithium Chloride Reaction Potassium Carbonate Extraction In this Example, 25 g samples of spent aluminosilicate contact material containing 1.7 V, 0.41 Ni and 1.66 Fe2O3 by weight, designated KNV K, were blended with mixtures of a 25 KC1 solution and a 25 LiCl solution, in varying proportions relative to each other and relative to the dry weight of the contact material. The contact material and KCl LiCl mixture was heated to 18500F for 15 minutes then extracted with water at 50 600C and then further extracted with 2 K2CO3 under reflux. While the KCl LiCl ratios varied in this example, reaction temperature and time remained fixed at 18500F and 15 minutes, respectively. Analyses were carried out as in Example 1 and the results are shown in Table VI. Metals extractions of about 70 resulted with mixtures of 20 or 24.4 KC1 and 20 LiCl, or 24.4 KC1 and 15 LiCl, based upon the dry weight of the spent contact material. The optimal ratio for spent contact material KC1 LiC1 .ranged from 100 20 15 to 100 24.4 20. The preferredKCl LiCl weight ratio, in terms of metals extraction, metals separation and minimal retention of Li2 0 in the solids was determined to be 1.6 1.

Example 4 Potassium Chloride Lithium Chloride Reaction Potassium Acetate Extraction In this example, a 100 g sample of KNV K spent aluminosilicate contact material was blended with 24.4 g KC1 and 20.0 g LiCl dry basis then heated to 18500F for 15 minutes. Nickel was extracted from the product with water at 50 600C. After extraction, the filter cake contained 1.73 V, 0.12 Ni, 1.47 K2O and 1.32 Li2O. A A 20 g aliquot of the filter cake was mixed with a solution containing 20 g potassium acetate and 20 g water. Thereafter, the mixture was dried at 2200C and introduced into a Lindberg crucible furnace at 3050C. The temperature was slowly raised to 3240C and maintained at this level for 30 minutes. The crucible was allowed to cool and the contents were extracted by stirring with 100 ml water at 90 1000C for 30 minutes.The flurry was filtered, washed and dried. and the solids analyzed. As a result, 92 of the Li2O, and 39 of the vanadium were extracted, as indicated by analysis of the filter cake 1.032 V, 0.12 Ni, 0.10 Li2O, 6 12 K2O. Another 20 g aliquot of the filter cake was mixed with 20 g potassium acetate, with the addition of 0.65 g KOH, the equivalent of the 2 K2 CO3 normally used in the second stage carbonate extraction, then heated as described above. As a result, 92 of the Li2 0 was extracted and 68 of The vanadium was extracted, as indicated by analysis of the filter cake 0.57 V, 0.12 Ni, 0.11 Li2O and 5 93 K2O. Example 5 Potassium Chloride Lithium Chloride Reaction Alkali Acetate Alkali Carbonate or Alkali Hydroxide Extraction Lithium recovery was studied for spent aluminosilicate contact material treatments in which the second stage extraction was an extraction with an alkali acetate and an alkali carbonate or an alkali acetate and an alkali hydroxide. In this example, 300 g of spent aluminosilicate contact material, KNV K, were mixed with 73.2 g KC1, 60.0 g LiCl and water in an evaporating dish to form a thin paste. The mixture was evaporated under a heat lamp with occasional stirring then dried for 1 hour at 2200C. The dry mixture was heated in 5 batches 85 g each at 18500F for 15 minutes. The calcine 424 g was crushed, screened 100 mesh sieve and extracted with 300 ml water 550C for 30 minutes.When filtered and dried the resulting 300.0 g residue analyzed Ni V K2O Li2OAssay residue x 0.10 1.7 1.4 2.2Metals extraction 77.2 7.4 91.0 67.6 Various lithium recovery procedures were studied by contacting a sample of the residue from the above described first stage extraction with a concentrated solution of alkali acetate and alkali carbonate, or alkali acetate and alkali hydroxide, in a wide form crucible. The resulting slurries were evaporated under a heat lamp, then dried at 2200C for 1 hour in an air oven. The dried product was placed in a 305 C crucible furnace and the temperature was slowly increased to the desired final temperature. After the desired residence time had passed, the sample was removed, then crushed, screened 100 mesh sieve and extracted with 10 times its weight of 550C water for 30 minutes. The resulting slurry was filtered and the filter cake washed with additional warm water. Tables VII andVIII indicate the metals content of the filtrate and dry filter cakes. As shown in the Tables, lithium recoveries between 93 and 97 were obtained. Vanadium extraction efficiencies were fairly insensitive to process conditions and averaged about 74 . Lithium extraction according to these processes resulted in a nearly stoichiometric build up of sodium or potassium oxide in the treated contact material. The preferred reaction conditions for the second stage extraction, in terms of lithium recovery, were heating of the water extracted contact material at about 3240C for about 30 to about 60 minutes with about 3 moles potassium atoms per mole lithium atoms present in the material. The potassium atom requirement was supplied from potassium acetate and potassium carbonate in the mole ratio of 2 0.5. These conditions provided a total lithium recovery of 97 . Residual metal content of the thus treated contact material was 0.1 Ni, 0.53 V, 0.28 Li2 O and 7 6 K2O.The second stage extraction procedures according to this example permitted simultaneous vanadium and lithium recovery while providing, for example, up to 72 total vanadium extraction. With the use of sodium, rather than potassium salts, a slight reduction in extraction efficiencies was observed. Ninety three percent lithium and 71 vanadium recoveries were achieved using 2.5 mole Na per mole Li and a 1 1 acetate carbonate mole ratio and heating the contact material at 3350C for 1 hour. Observed lithium recoveries with the use of sodium salts ranged from 91 93 , with 71 76 vanadium recovery. The use of sodium salts to recover lithium resulted in the retention of Na2O 4.5 , as well as K2O 1 , in the treated contact material. When sodium hydroxide was used in place of the corresponding carbonates, lithium extraction was reduced by 20 and vanadium extraction by 10 20 , although the lithium extraction required less water. An alternate embodiment of this process, thermally treated spent aluminosilicate contact material with lithium chloride and extracted the mixture with water. The extracted and washed solids analyzed 1.3 V, 0.13 Ni and 3.2 Li2O. The contact material was then refluxed with an equal weight of sodium acetate anhydrous as a 50 solution at the boiling point, with no addedNaOH. It was found that only 59 of the Li2O and 40 of the vanadium had been extracted. Comparison of the results of this Example with those of Example 4 reveals that the combination of potassium acetate and potassium hydroxide provides for both effective removal of vanadium and effective recovery of lithium.

The agglomerates were broken to pass 100 mesh, mixed and extracted with 300 ml water at 50 600C for 1 hour with HC1 5.4 g of 36.5 being added to reduce the pH to li0 and ensure dissolution of any precipitated nickel hydroxide. After ftering, washing and drying the samples and again passing them through a 100 mesh sieve, the product weighed 294.4 g and contained 1.3 V, 0.13 Ni and 3.2 Li2O. After dividing the filter cake into 25 g aliquots the samples were extracted by refluxing with various amounts of 35 w w H2 SO4 for various reaction times,and filtered and washed. The results are shown in Table IX. Overall weight loss, coextraction of alumina,and residual Li2O content in the treated aluminosilicate contact material were generally independent of the relative proportion of 35 H2SO4 used in the extraction. Co extraction of alumina and weight loss increased, and residual Li2 0 in the treated material decreased, with increasing reaction times. Alternatively, higher concentrations of sulfuric acid such as 50 60 w w H2 SO4 may be used in the second stage extraction. For example, when, after the first stage LiCl reaction and water extraction, a 25 g spent contact material sample was refluxed for 1 hour with boiling 50 w w H2SO4, extraction totals were 86 V and 83 Ni, with 10 A1203 extraction and Li2O content of 0.65 in the product. Thus, lithium chloride provides superior removal of metals as compared to potassium chloride but exacts a penalty in the processing required to recover the expensive lithium.

The spent aluminosilicate contact material treated in Examples 1 6 had high iron content, containing from about 1.55 to about 2.43 ferric oxide.In Examples 7 and 8, the spent aluminosilicate contact material had much lower iron content, ranging between 0.43 and 0.6 ferric oxide. The followingExamples demonstrate that the addition of iron, as ferric chloride in the water extraction or as ferric oxide to the alkali chloride aluminosilicate material mixture before thermal treatment, ensured adequate separation of nickel and vanadium.Example 7 Potassium Chloride Reaction Potassium Carbonate Extraction Low Iron Content Spent Aluminosilicate Contact Material Ferric Chloride Addition This Example used a 25 KC1 solution in the alkali chloride thermal treatment step, in a proportion of 32 parts of KCl by weight per 100 parts by weight of KNV C and KNV P spent aluminosilicate contact material and a 2 K2 CO3 solution for the alkali carbonate extraction.The KNV C and KNV P spent aluminosilicate contact materials contained much less iron than the KNV H, KNV J and KNV K samples, as indicated by the following analysis Ni Fe2O3 KNV C 0.92 0.21 0.60 KNV P 0.85 0.22 0.43 KNV H 1.34 0.36 1.55 KNV J 1.26 0.22 2.43 KNV K 1.7 0.41 1.66 After reacting 25 g samples of spent aluminosilicate contact material with KC1 at 19500F for 15 minutes7 the products were extracted with 40 ml water and 0.85 g FeCl3 6H2O equivalent to 1 Fe203 on the sample or 0.43 g ECl3. 6H2O equivalent to 0.5 Fe2O3 on the sample for 30 minutes.
