# Apparatus for uniformly applying either liquid or foam compositions to a moving web.

## Abstract
Either foam or liquid is supplied under pressure to a distributor 10 having a plurality of outlets 18 each connected to a respective passageway 28 extending along one side of a trough 42 . Means 34,32 are provided to combine the streams of material exiting the passageways prior to the material entering the trough. A curved blade 44 is positioned along the opposite side of the trough. As the trough fills, an overflow of material passes over the crest of the blade and moves along the blade s curvature so as to be uniformly deposited on a web of material 46 moving in a direction normal to the length of the trough.
