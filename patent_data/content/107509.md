# Protein A material and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
The gene coding for a protein A like material has been clo ned and expressed. The cloning of this gene with its nucleotide sequence characterization, enables quantities of a protein A like material nucleotide sequence for cloning to be obtained in various host vector systems. Protein A is a valuable compo nent of a variety of diagnostic test systems. The protein A like material, and subfragments thereof, have the protein A proper ties of binding to IgG at the Fc region and activation of poly clonal antibody synthesis.
