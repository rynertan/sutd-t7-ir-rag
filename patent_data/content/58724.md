# POWER AMPLIFIER.

## Abstract
A PWM signal power amplifier has a pulse width modulation signal generator circuit for generating a pulse width modulation signal having a width proportional to the amplitude of the input signal, an amplitude modulator circuit for amplitude modulatin the pulse width modulation signal in response to the level of the input signal, and a power amplifier stage driven by the modulated pulse width modulation signal. The amplitude modulator has, for instance, a pair of level shifting circuits 21 , 22 to which an input signal is applied, a pair of switching circuits 23 , 24 for switching the outputs of the level shifting circuits in accordance with the pulse width modulation signal, and an adder 25 for adding the outputs of the switching circuits. The amplitude modulated pulse width modulation signal can be obtained at the output of the adder, and efficiently drive the power amplifier stage using a bipolar transistor.
