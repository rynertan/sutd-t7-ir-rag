# Interactive synthetic speech CPR trainer prompter.

## Abstract
An interactive trainer prompter device serves to provide visual and synthetic speech prompts to a human operative to achieve a task that requires skills that may be critical, but infrequently required. In favourable embodiment, the trainer prompter device is employed for cardio pulmonary resusci tation. The device has a plurality of actuator push buttons and indicator lamps, and provides synthetic voice prompts. The human operative follows synthetic speech instructions, and interacts with the device by depressing the appropriate push button, for example, to indicate that a victim is not breathing, or has no detectable pulse.
