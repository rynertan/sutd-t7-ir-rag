# A rear view mirror assembly.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a rear view mirror assembly which facilitates installation of the components of the rear view mirror assembly on a windshield 1 of a vehicle. The rear view mirror assembly includes a base member 3, 5 , a spring 9 and a unit. The unit includes a mounting member 14 , a second ball member 18 , a bolt 19 and a support arm 15 on which the rear view mirror 25 is rotatably mounted. The spring 9 is mounted on the base member 3, 5 , and the spring 9 has a first engagement device 10 . The mounting member 14 includes a first socket portion 13 and a first aperture 141 . The support arm 15 has a first ball portion 161 which is slidably mounted on the first socket portion 13 of the mounting member 14 , and the support arm 15 has a second socket portion 162 which is slidably mounted on the second ball member 18 . The second ball member 18 has a protrusion 22 which is disposed in a second aperture 21 of the support arm 15 . The bolt 19 has an end disposed on the second ball member 18 , and the bolt 19 is inserted into the first aperture 141 of the mounting member 14 and the second aperture 21 of the support arm 15 . Therefore, the unit is united by the bolt 19 , and the protrusion 22 of the second ball member 18 temporarily prevents the support arm 15 from moving on the second ball member 18 .
