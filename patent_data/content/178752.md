## Description
DESCRIPTION This invention relates to dispersed phase toughened elastomers. More particularly, it relates to elastomers, especially rubbers, which have been modified by the addition of a relatively low molecular weight liquid telechelic polymer phase to produce a highly extensible product which retains or surpasses the outstanding abrasion resistance and hot mechanical properties of the unmodified elastomer. In oil well service, there is a growing demand for elastomers which can perform satisfactorily under extreme service conditions. For example, blowout preventer sealing elements are exposed to temperatures ranging from 700F to 4000F and to abrasive environments which severely challenge the ability of the elastomer to survive for satisfactory lengths of time in service. The addition of functional groups to high polymers is known to alter the properties of the resulting elastomer.When the functional group is incompatible. with the high polymer the result is a dispersed phase elastomer in which the functional groups are dispersed throughout the high polymer.It is also known that when linking agents such as zinc oxide are reacted with the functionally modified high polymer a link is achieved which is usually incompatible with the high polymer and is dispersed in said polymer. Presently known dispersed phase toughened rubbers such as carboxylated acrylonitrile butadiene rubbers exhibit out stand ing abrasion resistance, hot mechanical properties and the like. In these rubbers, the reactive site a carboxyl group that produced the dispersed or incompatible phase has been directly attached to the main chain of the elastomer. When the cross linking agent is added to such functionally modified high polymers, many of these dispersed phase toughened rubbers have required specialized processing, utilizing specialized additives and the resulting cross linked rubbers often do not have many of the properties desired in a low modulus, highly extensible rubber. It also appeared that the improvement in properties were limited by the amount of functional site which could be added to the main polymer chain of the elastomer. It has now been found that if the functional site that generates the incompatible dispersed phase is a component of a relatively low molecular weight liquid or semi solid additive instead of being attached to the main high polymer chain, and this additive is blended with the unmodified high polymer, a number of advantages are obtained. The benefits afforded by such a system include most of the advantages of the previously known dispersed phase toughened high polymers but, more importantly, permit one to tailor a material to the intended application simply by proper selection of 1 low molecular weight additive, 2 the particular functional groups thereon and 3 the linking additives which react with the functional groups. Thus the addition of functionality by the use of a low molecular weight additive vs the high polymer provides many more terminal sites for the functional groups for given weight of material. This additive may or may not be chemically compatible with the main constituent high polymer elastomer.Additionally, the low molecular weight additive polymer may be cure compatible with the high molecular weight component or alternately it may not enter into the curing reaction of the high molecular weight component whatsoever. Telechelic polymers are readily available with a variety of functionalities, such as carboxyl, amine, hydroxy, epoxy and similar reactive groups which can be further modified prior to cross linking, e.g., by esterification and other known chemistries. The linking additive may be chosen so as to form an ionomer which is dispersed in the high polymer, e.g., using a reactive metal compound, such as ZnO, CaO, or A1203, or the linking additive could be a multi functional epoxide such asEpon 828, based on bisphenol A and a diglycidyl ether, or it could be a metallic organic compound. Selection of the linking additive may depend on the functional group in the telechelic polymer. While for carboxyl functionality metal oxides or hydroxides are the preferred linking agents for amines or epoxy reactive groups the linking additive could be an organic or metallo organic compound such as a diamine or triamine aluminum isopropoxide naphthenates aliphatic and aromatic epoxides, etc. The advantages obtained from such a system include improved processability, superior mechanical properties compared to the same high polymer in an unmodified recipe, significantly improved hot mechanical properties and better dynamic fatigue resistance. Elastomers to which the present invention is applicable include the following relatively high molecular weight polymers Natural Rubber Synthetic Polyisoprene Rubber Styrene Butadiene Rubbers Polybutadiene Butyl Rubber Neoprene Ethylene Propylene Rubber Acrylonitrile Butadiene Rubber Silicone Rubber Fluoroelastomers Ethylene Acrylic Rubber Vinyl Acetate Ethylene Copolymer Epichlorohydrin Rubbers Chlorinated Polyethylene Rubbers Chlorosulfonated Polyethylene Rubbers Hydrogenated Nitrile Rubber Tetrafluoroethylene propylene rubber 1 Low Molecular Weight Polymer Additive The relatively low molecular weight polymers useful as additives in the preset invention are polymers which have a molecular weight up to about 30,000 to 40,000 and preferably between about 1000 to about 8000.They may be formed by polymerizing hydrocarbons with carbon carbon backbones, such as olefins, or they may be polymers of acrylates, ethers, esters, or other polymerizable vinyl or vinylidene compounds.Homopolymers and copolymers have been successfully used in the practice of this invention. The low molecular additive may be liquid, semi solid, or semi solid. Particularly preferred low molecular weight polymers utilized in the following examples include carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer and carboxyl terminated acrylonitrile polybutadiene polymer.Instead of a single telechelic polymer a mixture of such polymers with like or unlike reactive groups may be used.Similarly the invention may be practiced with a mixture of high molecular weight elastomers rather than a single such polymer. 2 Functional Groups The preferred functional groups present in the low molecular weight additive polymer are carboxyl COOH groups. Preferably, an average of from 1.5 to 2.5 functional groups are present per polymer molecule. Other functional groups which are useful instead of carboxyl groups include amine, ether, epoxy, hydroxy, halogen and other reactive groups which are known in the art for the provision of reactive, functional sites. 3 Linking Additives The linking additive provides both linking and the incompatibility which may be required for a dispersed phase in the end product. Various metal salts have been used for this purpose. The preferred linking additive is zinc oxide.Calcium oxide is another material which has been found useful in place of zinc oxide. Other materials which may be used as linking additives include aluminum oxide or hydroxide. The linking additive may be present in amounts which react with all or only a fraction of the functional groups. Usually at least 50 of the functional groups are reacted in order to provide a significant content of incompatible dispersed phase. 4 Proportions In preparing the improved dispersed phase composition, the several constituents noted above are present in the following relative proportions, in parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of high polymer elastomer 1 Low Molecular Weight Polymer Additive 5 to 70, preferably 5 25 depending on the properties desired 2 Linking Additive 1 to 25.

But what is even more significant is the retention or even general improvement in mechanical properties such as tensile strength both at room temperature and at 2500F, in contrast to the normally expected lowering of these properties, usually experienced when a low molecular weight liquid is added to a high molecular weight polymer. For instance comparing the tear strengths of the control it will be noted that it dropped from 122 to 84 whereas for formulation A, B, E and F it actually increased or decreased only slightly G . One possible explanation for the result inC may be the presence of a much higher degree of functionality in the low molecular weight liquid polymer additive, or the difference in viscosity. The effect of various levels of linking agent zinc oxide was investigated for similar formulations made with a polybutadiene nitrile rubber without any carboxyl functionality Table II and for similar formulations made with 10 parts by weight of carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile rubber CTBN 1300 x 13 . The results are shown in Tables II and III.

The products in Table III were softer and more readily processable and had noticeably better green tack. The tear strength at high temperatures 2500F was unexpectedly superior to that at roan temperature, instead of being decreased by such an addition. A similar study was made with CaO as the linking material, using 4.2 parts of CaO 0.1497 equivalents for each 10 parts of additive polymer and using low molecular weight liquid polymers A, B, C, F and G in the following formula4 on in parts by weight Control With AdditivePolybutadiene rubber gum stock 100 90 Taktene 220 Low molecular weight polymer additive 0 10Carbon black N 550 60 60Lubricant stearic acid 1 1Antioxidant Agerite Resin 1 1Cure accelerator AMAX 1 1Sulfur 1.5 1.5 The above formulation was prepared by mixing the ingredients as in the previous examples, using 4.2 parts of CaO as the linking additive.

For example, the room temperature and moduli microhardness are both noticeably increased and this is even more evident in these properties at 2500F. In the preceding examples the average molar ratio of metal oxide to carboxyl groups was about 25.5 to 1 thus providing a slight excess of the linkage additive and insuring that virtually all of the carboxyl groups reacted with the linking agent. Dispersed phase toughened elastomers prepared in accordance with this invention are useful in the fabrication of mechanical rubber goods intended to be used in severe environments where they are exposed to high temperatures and high mechanical stresses, for example seals, blowout preventer packers, belts, tires and similar articles.
