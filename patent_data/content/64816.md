# An electroconductive resin composition and a videodisc record.

## Abstract
An electroconductive resin composition suitable for use in preparing videodisc records comprises a blend of 5 to 30 by weight of carbon black and a graft polymer obtained by graft polymerizing 99 to 76 parts by weight of monomeric vinyl chloride onto 1 to 15 parts by weight of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, said copolymer containing therein 10 to 65 by weight of vinyl acetate.
