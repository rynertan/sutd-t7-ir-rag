## Description
This invention relates to fibers and yarns of a certain class of aromatic polyetherketones and their production by a melt spinning process. The polymers contemplated by this invention are disclosed in the U.S. patents Nos.4,320,224 4,360,630 and 4,446,294. These crystalline, linear polymers contain in the polymer chain at least 50 percent of the following repeating unit hereinafter referred to as repeating unit I The polymers may be composed solely of repeating units I or may contain other repeating units as hereinafter defined and they have inherent viscosities IV measured at 25 C in a solution of the polymer in concentrated sulphuric acid of density 1.84 g cm ³, said solution containing 0.1 g of polymer per 100 cm³ of solution of at least 0.7. These polymers are exceptionally useful in that they possess excellent mechanical and electrical properties, coupled with outstanding thermal and combustion characteristics. They also show resistance to a very wide range of solvents and proprietary fluids. They are thus very suitable in applications where the service conditions are too demanding for the more established, high performance polymers and in particular where the polymers are liable to high service temperatures. In view of the foregoing desirable properties of these particular aromatic polyetherketones, it would be advantageous if they could be easily formed into filaments, fibers and yarns since the latter products could then be made for example into knitted, woven, and non woven fabrics, fiberfill and insulation products suitable for applications utilizing their excellent physical and chemical properties. However, the same combination of properties which would make filaments, fibers and yarns made from these polymers very desirable in various applications, e.g. heat and solvent resistance, also causes them to be very difficult to spin into such filaments, fibers and yarns. Thus, if it is attempted to melt spin these polymers into filaments in a conventional manner, the use of a relatively low spinning temperature results in a high melt viscosity which significantly reduces spinning stability due to high spinning pressures, clogging of the spinneret holes, uneven polymer coagulation and frequent filament rupture. On the other hand, unduly high spinning temperatures result in polymer degradation and cross linking which cause void, gel and speck formation in the filaments and render them unsuitable for most uses. In view of these factors, successful spinning into filaments and yarns of the polymers contemplated by this invention is not easily accomplished. Although U.S. Patent Nos. 4,320,224, and 4,446,294 disclose broadly that polymers containing a major proportion of repeating unit I may be fabricated into any desired shape including fibers, they do not have any specific teaching of how such fibers may in fact be formed. Research Disclosure No. 21602 April 1982 discloses that a sample of polyetheretherketone having the repeat unit US A 4,359,501 discloses a fabric having machine direction and cross machine direction threads interwoven with one another and finished into an endless belt, wherein certain of the threads are formed of a monofilament of a melt extrudable polyetheretherketone having repeating units In accordance with this invention, a linear aromatic polyetherketone comprising at least 50 percent of repeating unit I in the polymer chain and having an inherent viscosity IV of at least 0.7 as hereinbefore defined is melt spun at a temperature in the range of from 20 C above to 80 C above the melting point of the polymer, using a filter pack filtering area of at least 8 in² 51.6 cm² , preferably 15 to 25 in² 96.8 to 161.3 cm² and a total volume of at least 1.2 in³ 19.7 cm³ , preferably 1.6 to 2.3 in³ 26.2 to 37.7 cm³ , per pound 0.45 kg of polymer extruded per hour with a filtering medium of inert particles having numerous angles, indentations and or irregularities and a mesh size of 25 to 140 710 µm to 106 µm . The particles of filter medium may be for example shattered metal , e.g. carbon steels and stainless steels, aluminium oxides and silicates, e.g. sold under the trademarks Alundum and Bauxilite , ground ceramics and sand. The filter medium must be sufficient to provide a pressure drop of at least 800 psig 5516 kPa gauge , preferably 950 to 3000 psig 6550 to 20684 kPa gauge . Such a filter pack size and type of filter medium have been found to provide an adequate degree of shear necessary for stable spinning of the contemplated polymers to filaments of commercially acceptable deniers without an undesirably large increase in spinning pressure. In addition to the filter medium mentioned previously, it is in most instances desirable to employ a fine filter screen across the filtering area downstream of the filter for the purpose of separating specks and gels which get through the filter pack. Such a screen in general has openings of under 20 microns µm , preferably in the range of 3 to 10 µm. In order to further maintain stable spinning in carrying out the process of the invention, it is preferable not to quench the extruded filaments, i.e. the filaments are cooled in non circulating air at ambient temperatures and are not contacted with any forced draft of any gas cooler than the surroundings. Moreover, to maintain stable spinning, it is preferable to operate the process such that the extruded filaments converge within 15 to 50 inches 38.1 to 127 cm , preferably in the range of 20 to 30 inches 50.8 to 76.2 cm of the spinneret. The process of this invention if carried out such that the filaments are extruded directly from the spinneret holes into non circulating air at ambient temperatures is adequate for the formation of yarns of relatively higher dpf denier per filament , e.g. up to 100. 1 denier 1g per 9 km or about 0.1111 tex. However, it may be difficult to use such a process for the production of yarns of relatively lower dpf,e.g. below about 15 dpf. The reason for this is that the polymer which is high melting rapidly solidifies as it is extruded into ambient conditions, and drawdown to relatively lower dpf s is severely limited. Thus, in accordance with another aspect of the invention, an improvement in the foregoing spinning process is provided whereby the extruded filaments are heated by passing them through a heating zone, e.g. a heated tube or shroud, immediately on being extruded through the spinneret holes. This prevents the filaments from solidifying too rapidly and allows for the drawdown of the filaments to deniers considerably lower than would otherwise be possible. If a heated tube is utilized to heat the filaments, it may be made of any material capable of withstanding the temperatures employed which will generally be in the range, for example, of about 200 to 320 C, preferably about 290 to 310 C. Such material may be, for example, metal, e.g. aluminium or steel, ceramic or glass. Any conventional heating means may be used, e.g. electrical heating elements, steam, hot liquid or gas etc. A specific heated tube assembly which may be used is an aluminium tube inclosed in a steel heater band. The diameter of the heating zone, e.g. the heated tube is generally the same as the spinneret, e.g. 1½ to 5 in. 3.8 to 12.7 cm , preferably about 3 to 4 ½ in. 7.6 to 11.4 cm and the length is in the range,for example, of about 3 to 12 inches 7.6 to 30.5 cm , preferably about 5 to 8 inches 12.7 to 20.3 cm and most preferably 6 inches 15.2 cm . The remaining conditions which may be utilized in the process are conventional for melt spinning and are not considered critical to the invention. Thus the polymer may be extruded through a spinneret plate containing, for example 10 to 100 holes each with a diameter in the range of about 0.009 to 0.013 inch 0.23 to 0.33 mm to produce filaments which are taken up at a speed, for example of about 50 to over 1000 meters per minute, preferably about 70 to over 200 meters per minute if no heating zone is utilized downstream of the spinneret. The filaments produced may have a denier per filament, for example of about 2.8 to 100. If no heating zone is utilized on the downstream side of the spinneret, then the denier per filament is preferably about 15 to 100, more preferably about 15 to 40. If such a heating zone is utilized, the denier per filament is preferably about 2.8 to 40, more preferably about 2.8 to 15. The filaments may have a circular cross section resulting from the use of circular spinneret holes, or may have any of various non circular cross sections resulting from the use of different non circular spinneret hole shapes, e.g. multilobal cross sections containing, for example, six lobes, produced by using star shaped spinneret holes containing for example six protrusions. The fibers and yarns resulting from the process of this invention, and particularly when a heating zone is utilized on the downstream side of the spinneret, generally have a tenacity in the range of about 0.89 to 4.0 cN dtex 1 to 4.5 grams per denier , an elongation at break of about 15 to 200 percent, a modulus of about 18 to 71 cN dtex 20 to 80 grams per denier , and a birefringence in the range of about 0.025 to 0.220. The process of this invention when a heating zone is employed is particularly useful in the production of yarns having the foregoing mechanical properties and dpf s under 15, for example from about 2.8 to just under 15, e.g. from about 2.8 to 14.8. When no heating zone is employed on the downstream side of the spinneret, the fibers and yarns resulting from the process of this invention often have a tenacity in the range of about 0.89 to 1.78 cN dtex 1 to 2 grams per denier , an elongation at break of about 50 to 160 percent and modulus of about 18 to 27 cN dtex 20 to 30 grams per denier . The birefringence of such filaments may be in the range of about 0.025 to 0.150. The preferred polymers which may be formed into filaments in accordance with this invention consist solely of repeating unit I and have an IV of at least 0.7 measured in concentrated sulfuric acid as described previously. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,320,224 such polymers may be made by polycondensing hydroquinone and 4,4 difluorobenzophenone with an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate excluding the sole use of sodium carbonate or biocarbonate in a solvent such as diphenyl sulfone. Part of the 4,4 difluorobenzophenone e.g. up to 50 percent, may be replaced with 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone or 4 chloro 4 fluorobenzophenone. These polymers consisting solely of repeating units I in the polymer chain generally have a melting point of about 335 C so that in carrying out the spinning process of the invention, the polymer melt is extruded at temperatures of about 355 C to about 415 C. Polymers containing up to 50 percent of repeating units other than repeating unit I are also contemplated and may be formed by replacing up to 50 mol percent of the hydroquinone in the monomer mixture with any of certain other dihydroxyphenols and up to 50 mol percent of the 4,4 difluorobenzophenone with any or certain other aromatic dihalides. For example, up to 50 mol percent of the hydroquinone may be substituted with a dihydroxy phenol cocondensant of the formula in which A is a direct link, oxygen, sulphur, SO₂ , CO , or a divalent hydrocarbon radical. Examples of such bisphenols are The substitution of part of the hydroquinone with any of the foregoing dihydroxy phenols causes the following repeating units hereinafter referred to as repeating unit II to be present in the polymer chain interspersed with repeating unit I Alternatively or in addition to the substitution of part of the hydroquinone with another dihydroxyphenol, up to 50 mol percent of the 4,4 difluorbenzophenone may be replaced with one or more dihalide cocondensants of the formula in which X and X , which may be the same or different, are halogen atoms and are ortho or para preferably the latter to the groups Q and Q and Q and Q , which may be the same or different, are CO or SO₂ Ar is a divalent aromatic radical and n is 0,1,2 or 3. The aromatic radical Ar is preferably a divalent aromatic radical selected from phenylene, biphenylylene or terphenylylene. Particularly preferred dihalides have the formula where m is 1,2 or 3. Examples of such dihalides include Although substitution of the 4,4 difluorobenzophenone with 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone and or 4 chloro 4 fluorobenzophenone does not change the units of the polymer chain, it has been found that up to 50 mol percent of the difluoro compound may be so replaced without adverse effects and with consequent cost advantage. Substitution of part of the 4,4 difluorobenzophenone with any of the other specified dihalides causes the following units hereinafter referred as repeating unit III to be present in the polymer chain. in which the oxygen atoms in the sub units are ortho or para to the groups Q and Q . Where both dihydroxy phenol and dihalide other than the dichloro or chlorofluoro benzophenone cocondensants are employed, the polymer will contain, in addition to repeating units I, II and III, the following repeating units hereinafter referred to as repeating unit IV In the following examples tenacity and modulus are given in grams denier. The corresponding S.I. unit is cN dtex. 0.89 cN dtex 1 gram denier.

From there, it passed into screw extruder 2 which was heated by electrical heater bands divided into three zones. The polymer which followed the path indicated by line 3 was heated to 246 C in the near section of the extruder, and melted and heated to 346 C and 363 C in the centre and front sections respectively. The melted polymer was then passed into the top of block i.e. spinning chamber, 4 from which it was passed to pump 5 a standard Zenith gear pump and back into block 4 which was surrounded by electrical heater bands. The polymer melt, heated in block 4 to about 382 C, was passed into filter pack 6 which contained shattered metal filtering medium 7 in which the particles had a mesh size of about 25 to 50 710 µm to 300 µm .
