# Device for sensing moving light source.

## Abstract
The device includes a plurality of photosensors arranged in elaborated positions for accurate operation. A top plate 100 is formed with a calibrated cruciform opening 112 to minimize indirect light tending to enter the device. Some of the photosensors expected to receive direct light through the cruciform opening are adjustable in position in two perpen dicular directions relative to the remaining part of the device. The device can be disassembled for ease of production, maintenance, etc.
