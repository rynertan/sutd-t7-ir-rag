## Description
A CONNECTOR FOR COAXIALLY SHIELDED CABLEThis invention relates to connectors for connecting condutors of coaxially shielded cables to non coaxial male contacts.Coaxially shielded cables are well known as the highest fidelity signal wiring for digital signals and analog signals throughout the microwave frequency range. The advent of large scale integrated circuits has increased the density and complexity of electronic circuitry to the point where coaxially shielded cables are often required for interconnection in high density applications. However, the usefulness of coaxially shielded cables has been limited by cumbersome and time consuming connection methods.A requirement exists for an improved connector which allows the use of coaxially shielded cables in existing, welldeveloped hardware systems for packaging electronic circuitry.According to the invention, there is provided a connector for connecting conductors of coaxially shielded cables to non coaxial male contacts disposed in a row, said connector characterised by a first inner contact compatible with each of a plurality of the male contacts, said first inner contact being electrically and mechanically connected to a first inner conductor of one of the coaxially shielded cables, an electrically insulating element surrognding the first inner contact, an outer rectangularsection contact surrounding the insulating element, electrically and mechanically connected to an outer conductor of one of the coaxially shielded cables and fastened to the jacket of said coaxial cable, and a further contact electrically connecting one or more of the outer contacts to one or more of said male contacts or to an external circuit.The invention will now be particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the first embodiment of the invention showing an auxiliary contact Figure 2 is a perspective view of a second embodiment of the invention showing a supplemental contact andFigure 3 is an axial cross sectional view of a portion of a first embodiment of the invention showing the first inner contact, the outer contact and the insulating element.A first embodiment of a coaxial connector according to the present invention is described with reference to Figures 1 and 3 wherein like elements have like numbers. A first inner contact 10 comprising a standard contact which is fully compatible with the standard, non coaxial round pin or square post male contacts 80 commonly used in packaging electronic circuitry is connected to a first inner conductor 90 of a coaxial cable 100 at junction 91. The standard square post male contacts 80 can be of lengths varying from approximately 0.2 inches 5 cms to approximately 1 inch 2.5 cms and transverse facial dimensions of 0.025 inches 0.064 cms square. Round pin male contacts are typically between .020 inches 0.051 cms and .035 inches 0.089 cms in diameter.An electrically insulating medium 20 surrounds the first inner contact 10 and extends axially along the surface of the first inner contact 10.The insulating medium 20 is surrounded by an outer contact 30 to which is connected the outer conductor 92 of a coaxial cable 100. The axes of the first inner contact 10 and the outer contact 30 are substantially mutually coincident or parallel. The outer contact 30 is a hollow rectangular section solid having a transverse face of which the dimension of the side extending along the row of contacts 80 is slightly smaller than the centerto center distance of the contacts 80. This center tocenter distance can be as small as 0.100 inches 0.254 ans .An auxiliary contact 40 is installed among a row of standard male contacts 80 by connecting a socket 50 of contact 40 onto a standard male contact 80 or by connecting two spaced sockets 50 of contact 40 on to two standard male contacts 80 spaced apart along a row of male contacts 80.The auxiliary contact 40 can be made from a strip of any highly conductive material. The shape of the auxiliary contact 40 is such that a portion of the auxiliary contact 40 contacts a portion of the outer contact 30 whenever an outer contact 30 is connected to one of the standard male contacts disposed in a row. For example, the auxiliary contact 40 can be shaped as a square wave, made of springy metal strip and installed among a row of standard male contacts 80 such that, whenever an outer contact 30 is connected to one of the standard male contacts, three axial faces of that outer contact 30 contact portions of the auxiliary contact 40. Of course, other shapes are possible which will also provide sufficient contact between the auxiliary contact 40 and an outer contact 30.The outer contact 30 can be selectively supplied with an electrically insulating coating to leave exposed only portions of the outer contact 30 which serve as electrical contact points.The advantage of the auxiliary contact 40 is that the outer conductors of several coaxial cables can be efficiently connected together and to the electronic circuitry. This prevents wasting space that occurs if the outer conductors are separately tied together or if each outer conductor is separately tied to the electronic circuitry. For example, the outer conductors can all be tied to ground by connecting the socket 50 of the auxiliary contact 40 to a standard male contact which is grounded. This eliminates the need for separately grounding each outer conductor.A modification of this embodiment can be achieved by selectively applying an electrically insulating coating to the outer contact 30 and to the auxiliary contact 40 to leave said contacts exposed substantially only at their interface.A second embodiment of a coaxial connector according to the present invention is shown in Figure 2. Instead of using an auxiliary contact, this embodiment contains a supplemental contact 60. The supplemental contact 60 is disposed for connection to a male contact 80 adjacent to the male contact to which the first inner contact 10 of the connector is connected. The supplemental contact 60, which can be of trough shape as illustrated, is compatible with each of the standard male contacts 80, and is oriented so that its axis is substantially parallel to the outer contact 30. One axial face of the supplemental contact 60 is mechanically connected to a portion of one axial face of the outer contact 30 by a connecting element 70, for example, so that an electrical connector subsists at the interface.This embodiment containing the supplemental contact 60 is useful when the outer conductor of coaxial cables must be connected to electronic circuitry and yet not all of the outer conductors are to be connected to the same electronic circuit.The above embodiments can be easily modified to provide for a second inner contact not shown connected to a second inner conductor of a coaxial cable and compatible with the standard male contacts. The second inner contact must be electrically insulated from both the first inner contact 10 and the outer contact 30 and must be disposed so that the distance from the center of the second inner contact to the center of the first inner contact louis equal to the center to center distance of the male posts 80. In such a case,the shape of the outer contact 30 and the auxiliary contact 40 must be appropriately modified. No modification of the supplemental contact 60 is necessary.It will be apparent that the number of connectors to be used will be limited by the number of male contacts which are not directly engaged by an auxiliary contact or a supplemental contact.
