# Fucosyl antigens, a process for their preparation and antibodies for recognising them, a cancer diagnosing kit containing the fucosyl antigens and a method for determination of cancer associated carbohydrate linkages.

## Abstract
A process for obtaining sugar antigen by reacting a haptene of oligosaccharide containing α fucopyranosyl 1 3 , 1 4 or 1 6 galactopyranosyl group with a carrier protein, a process for preparing an antibody by administer ing the sugar antigen to mammals and collecting produced antigen, a method for measuring tumor associated sugar chain having α fucopyranosyl 1 3 , 1 4 or 1 6 galactopyranosyl group through immune reaction, and a kit for diagnosis of tumor which kit contains the antibody.
