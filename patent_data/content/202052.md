# Auxiliary reactor protection system and method.

## Abstract
In protection apparatus for a control system, e.g., of a nuclear reactor, redundant trip logic microprocessors pro duce partial trip signals which are voted on by a pair of voters at the power interface to the actuated devices. The logic implemented by each trip logic processor is straightfor ward and can be designed for each individual plant. An automatic tester and testing method can confirm the accura cy of A D converters, digital inputs, check the trip points of bistable, verify all the trip and voting logic, and measure the time response of each channel. A test subsystem uses a microcomputer to control the isolation of the analog field sensor signals and digital contact signals from the analog and digital inputs, control the generation and or injection of various combinations of reference and test signals, and monitor the response of the trip logic processors and voter to the test signals.
