# Pivotable seat support.

## Abstract
A horizontally adjustable seat support 138 may be rotated 180 to lock in either a forward facing position or a rearward facing position. A latching mechanism 76 restricts frame movement from horizontal or pivotal movement but may be partially displaced for free horizontal adjustment without releasing the pivotal lock. Horizontal seat tracks 106 may engage the lower or alternatively the upper portions of rollers 96, 100, 102, 104 carried between the seat tracks, depending on the lateral position of the seat frame.
