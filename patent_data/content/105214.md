# Method and Apparatus for writing large lithographic patterns.

## Abstract
A large lithographic pattern is written as quickly as possi ble by writing successive subpatterns in a vector scan mode of operation without any interruption between successive sub patterns. This is made possible by arranging the subpatterns so that they are adjacent to each other and are preferably overlap ping and by gradually moving the workpiece with respect to the writing field so as to always keep the subpattern being written within the writing field of the beam. The speed and direction of the workpiece movement relative to the writing field is not predetermined for all patterns but is controlled instead by the pattern being written. A sparsely written pattern or portion of a pattern is accompanied by a more rapid table movement than what accompanies a densely written pattern or portion of a pat tern. This is made possible by embedding pattern determined workpiece movement commands within the pattern defining data. Through the workpiece movement commands, relative movement between the workpiece and the writing field may be continously controlled with respect to movement direction, velocity and acceleration. Beam source 10 is controllably turned on and off by blan king apparatus 12 and deflected by deflector apparatus 14. The beam is incident on workpiece 18 on table 16. The position of table 16 is detected by X, Y detectors 24, 26 and controlled by X, Y servos 20, 22. Servos 20, 22 are, in turn, controlled from comparator 28 which compares the desired workpiece position obtained from pattern data memory 34 with the actual workpiece position. The pattern data is used to control X, Y de flection drivers 58, 60 together with X Y correction signals from comparator 30 and representing any difference between the workpiece reference position and its actual position.
