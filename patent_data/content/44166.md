# Butadiene toughened adhesive composition.

## Abstract
A structurally toughened heat resistant adhesive com position comprising a solution of butadiene styrene block copolymers in polymerizable acrylate ester monomers. The adhesive composition also contains an adhesion promoter, a cross linking agent, a free radical generator and a free radical accelerator. The adhesive compositions are generally used as two part systems, and yield bonds with improved heat and solvent resistant properties. The polymerizable acrylate ester monomers may be monofunctional or a combination of mono and polyfunc tional monomers. Among the useful classes of monomers are alkyl and cycloalkyl acrylates, alkyl and cycloalkyl methacrylates, alkoxy acrylates and methacrylates, alkylene diacrylates and dimethacrylates. A few of the preferred monomers are methyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate isobornyl methacrylate, and tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate. It is preferred that the butadiene styrene rubbers be block copolymers with the structures of A n B m, ABA n or A B n, wherein A represents a polystyrene chain and B represents a polybutadiene chain n and m are integers greater than or equal to one 1 and define the number of repeating units. Additionally, these structures generally contain a functional group at one or both ends of the plymer chain. Suitable functional groups are vinyl, epoxy, carboxy, and mercapto groups.
