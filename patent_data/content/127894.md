# Nickel iron brazing alloys containing carbon.

## Abstract
Low levels of carbon in nickel based brazing alloys con taining controlled levels of iron and boron and optionally chromium and silicon yield lower melting points, improve the contact angle and yield harder brazed joints than similar alloys without carbon addition.
