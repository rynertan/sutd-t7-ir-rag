# POLYMER COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A crosslinkable composition comprising A a silyl polym er, for example an ethylene vinyl trimethoxy silane copolym er, and B a silanol condensation catalyst which is an organic polymer having its polymer chains bridged by dihydrocarbyl tin IV containing units of the formula .O.SnR¹R²O. Also dis closed are aliphatic alpha olefin unsaturated carboxyl com pound copolymers containing similar dihydrocarbyl tin IV bridges. The compositions can be theremoformed into arti cles, e.g. cable insulation, and crosslinked by water treatment.
