# An aircraft carried smoke bomb.

## Abstract
An aircraft carried smoke bomb includes a braking para chute 22 which slows down the bomb after it is released from an aircraft. At some point in its downward travel main para chutes 40 are deployed as the tail and nose sections 12, 16 are ejected. Smoke starts exiting through the opposite ends of the remaining body as the bomb drops down slowly to the ground.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A smoke bomb releasable from a flying object to produce a smoke screen on the ground, characterized by a main body section, including a main parachute housing portion, and sections containing smoke producing means on opposite sides a tail section with a braking parachute therein and an adjustable timer in said tail section whereby after said bomb is released and after a time set by said timer elapses, said braking parachute is deployed, and subsequently thereto the tail section is separated, the main parachute is deployed and said smoke producing means activated, upon the application of a selected force on said braking parachute, so that smoke is emitted from the main body section, with said main parachute decelerating the main body section to the ground. 2. A smoke bomb according to Claim 1, characterized in that said bomb further includes a nose section releasable with the tail section. 3. A smoke bomb according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said time is adjustable to provide a delay of several seconds for the deployment of said braking parachute. 4. An arrangement according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that said main body section includes at least two parachutes which are deployable when said tail section is released, with smoke being emitted from both ends of said main body section. 5. An arrangement according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that said main body section is separable into two parts each containing smoke producing means and said bomb includes a separate main parachute for each part of the main body, whereby two separate parts with smoke producing means decelerate to the ground.

## Description
An aircraft carried smoke bomb The present invention generally relates to pyrothecnic producing devices and, more particularly, to a pyrothecnic bomb, finding particular application in warfare. Although the invention will first be described in connection with a smoke bomb it is not intended to be limited thereto. In warfare there are many cases in which the production of a smoke screen is desirable. Some examples include creation of a reasonably long duration smoke screen to screen friendly ground forces in critical operations, e.g. landing operations, mine field clearing, rescue operations and the like. Smoke screens can also be used for target marking, enemy blinding, decoy operation and for other purposes. It is also generally desirable that the smoke producing means be designed within a bomb body so as to be easily adaptable to be carried aboard existing military aircraft. It is to provide such a bomb that one aspect of the present invention is driected. The present invention may be defined as a smoke bomb comprising a main body section including smoke producing means deployable parachutes a tail section with a braking parachute and including timing means for controlling the detachment of said tail section from said main body section, the parachutes in the latter being deployable to decelerate the main section and means for initiating said smokeproducing means to produce and release smoke from at least one end of said main body section, only when a predetermined force is applied to said braking parachute. In another feature of the invention the smoke comes out from both ends of the main body section, with the main parachutes connected to the main body section. The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention will best be understood from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figs. lA lE show the bomb at various stages in its downward travel Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the bomb Fig. 3 is a side view of another embodiment of the bomb. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Attention is directed to Figs. 1A 1E in which the novel smoke bomb is shown in different flight position.Also, attention is made to Fig. 2 which is a cross sectional diagram of the smoke bomb, designated by 10. As shown in the Figures the bomb includes a tail assembly 12, two main pyrotechnic containers 13 and 14 and a compartment 15 for the main parachutes. Also included is a nose assembly 16. The tail assembly 12 contains a mechanical timer assembly 21, which is capable of providing a preset time delay of 3 51 seconds. A braking parachute 22 with a delay and ignition system 24 are also included.The smoke producing matter or smoke charge 25 are in containers 13 and 14. In section 15 are located the main parachutes 30 and the deployment mechanism. An auxiliary parachute may be included. The nose section 16 consists of a low drag ogive which houses the nose separation mechanism. The sequence of operation may be described as follows To insure the proper functioning of the bomb it is equipped with a parachute deceleration mechanism 22, which results in the bomb s soft ground landing. This deceleration mechanism is initiated by the timer 21, once released. This enables the bomb to be released from a stand off position. Fig. 1A shows the bomb after release. As soon as the bomb is released from the aircraft an arming wire 35 is withdrawn from the timer. After a delay time which was chosen by the preset timer 21, the following sequence takes place a. The braking parachute is deployed. See Fig. 1B. b. A safety pin 36 is free to move and completes the pyrotechnic train only if a sufficient force is applied to braking parachute 22, indicating the bomb being actually in flight. c. Ignition of the pyrotechnic time delay elements not shown . If however, the bomb has not been released from an aircraft, the fdrce on the braking parachute 22 is not sufficient to pull safety pin 36. Thus the production of smoke is not initiated. After the speed of the smoke bomb 10 has been reduced by the braking parachute for a selected period, e.g. three seconds, the following occur simultaneously a. The tail and nose sections separate. See Fig. 1C. b. The two smoke charges in containers 13 and 14 ignite and c. The main parachutes become deployed. The bomb continues to descend at a speed of about 25 m sec., lands softly on the ground and emits smoke from both ends of the bomb s main section, definable as the bomb, less the tail and nose sections. See Fig. 1E. The novel smoke bomb is designable to be carried without modifications by most modern, high performance aircraft or helicopters. One embodiment was actually reduced to practice to be carried by aircraft equipped with standard 14 in bomb carriers. It can be released in level flight, in dive or in pull up. When in pull up the bomb can be released from a stand off position thus avoiding the need for the airplane to fly over enemy terrain. In another embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 3, after the bomb is dropped the braking parachute like the one shown in Fig. 2 and designated by 22 is deployed. If sufficient pull is applied to it, thus indicating that the bomb is dropping to the ground with sufficient speed, a detonator is activated. It activates the smoke producing matter in two separate smoke chambersA and B. Also the braking parachute and the tail section 12 separate, thus deploying a main parachute B. At about the same time the two chambers A and B separate by mechanism 50. Also the nose section 16 is separated, causing main parachute A to be deployed. As a result the two chambers A and B gently drop to the ground by their respective main parachutes A and B. Consequently two separate sources of smoke are produced. From the foregoing it should be appreciated that in accordance with the invention a smoke bomb is provided which is capable of being dropped from an aircraft to produce smoke on the ground. It is only activated when actually dropped from an aircraft as indicated by the pulling force on the braking parachute which initiates the smoke production. If desired instead of smoke any other pyrotechnic effect may be produced, e.g. flashing or continuous light. Thus the term pyrotechnic effect should be regarded as including smoke, light or the like. Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated herein, it is recognized that modifications and variations may readily occur to those skilled in the art and consequently, it si intended that the claims be interpreted to cover such modifications and equivalents.
