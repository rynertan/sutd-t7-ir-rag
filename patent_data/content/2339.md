## Abstract
The improvements relating to data display techniques comprise a circuit for interpolating discrete data points of a single valued function in one direction into a continuous line display. Only one value need to be produced from a memory for each display position along one axis of an x, y coordinate system display, the circuit generates lines parallel to the oither axis which connect the display at adjacent positions along the first axis. The circuit receives from a memory 10 a series of pulse trains D each of which is delayed one clock pulse position by flip,flop 2 to produce a pulse train D . D and D are compared by exclusive OR gate 26 to determine the data end positions which are stored in a shift register 34 . The output of shift register 34 is recirculated and supplied to OR gate 16 , the composite data outputted by OR gate 18 representing the current input data D, the delayed data D derived therefrom and data representative of end positions of data in one or more proceeding lines. AND gate 44 and AND gate 28 cooperate with nOR gate 40 to block the recirculation through shift register 34 of data represen tative of rise lines and fill lines for avoiding illogical rise and fall line generation. A second circuit has separate circuits for processing rise lines and fall lines.

## Description
Improvements relating to data display techniques This invention concerns improvements in or relating to data display techniques, and more particularly concerns the interpolation of data for activating elements of a display matrix which have no counterpart in the actual input data thereby to fill in and make continuous parts of the display which otherwise would be vacant. In its broadest aspect, the present invention provides a system for interpolating data assembled to be displayed in a display matrix comprising a plurality of data display lines each comprising a plurality of data display elements by addressing the data display elements of the matrix selectively each according to a display line identification representative of that one of the display lines which contains the respective display element and a display element identification representative of the position of the respective data display element in the respective display line, such identifications being provided by the assembled data, said system being arranged to derive from said assembled data adclitional data to be displayed therewith in said display matrix, said additional data corresponding to data display elements such as to provide, when all the data is displayed, a continuum of addressed data display elements between each pair of data display elements of the display matrix which correspond to data of said assembled data and which have different display line identifications and have display element identifications corresponding to the positions of data display elements which are iiext adjacent to one another in the display matrix. The inventions has particular, though not exclusive, application to a data display system comprising a memory providing a plurality of word storage locations each capable of storing any one of a predetermined number of unique data bit combinations, a display matrix comprising a number of data display lines each corresponding to a respective one of said predetermined number of unique data bit combinations ad each comprising a number of data display locations corresponding to the number of said word storage locations, means for selectively addressing data display locations of said matrix each time according to a correspoiiding word storage location in the memory and according to a corresponding one of said unique data bit combinations stored thereat, and means for interpolating the data in said memory so as to derive therefrom additional data for addressing such of said data display locations as to provide a continuum of addressed display locations between two data display locations corresponding to data stored in said memory for display in different display lines and having word storage location addresses corresponding to the positions of data display locations which are next adjacent to one another in the display matrix. In a typical raster scan type cathode ray tube disi ay for example, nn image is generated by allowing a scanning electroii beam to strike the phosphor on the face of the cathode ray tube only at selected locations and by blaiiking off the electron beam as it scans over all other locations.To maintain an image generated in this maniier on the cathode ray tube it is necessary for the electron beam continuously to repeat the scanning of the same data. To allow this repeated scanning, the data is normally stored in a memory.in the past, the memory, in order to be able to address any point on the face of the cathode ray tube, had to contain M storage positions, where M is equal to the number of scan lines per frame times the number of elements of resolution in one scan line. A display, for example, of 240 visib e scan lines and 256 reselvable elements per scan line, that is about half the number of points of a standard TV screen, would require 240 X 256 or 61,440 addressable storage elements. If the beam is to be switched on or off at each location, storage elements are only required to be single bit memories. By virtue of the present invention it has been found that in the case for example of a display of a waveform which is single valued in one direction, i.e. perpendicular to the scan line, the number of storage positions provided in the memory need only be equal to the number of resolvable elements in one scan line with each storage position being large enough to contain data such as to provide a unique indication as to which scan line of the display is to be addressed. In the example given above of 240 visible scan lines and 256 resolvable elements, 256 storage positions would be required and each of the storage positions would have to be able to uniquely address any one of the 240 lines. This is to say, each storage position must have the ability to ake any one of 240 different values.In the case of a solid state memory made up of memory bits, each bit having two states, each memory position must have N memory bits where 2N number of scan Lines. To be able to address 240 different scan lines, tight memory bits are needed. Thus, 256 memory positions, each with eight bits, requires only 2,048 bits of memory as oposod to the 61,440 bits required for a conventional 25 X 240 bit matrix memory. Of course, the present invention applies to displays of any size. If there is oiily one memory storage position for each data display position along the rastcr scan liiies, then the data at any memory storage position can be displayed on only one scan line. Such a display on a cathode ray tube would appear as a series of disjointed points or horizontal line segments vertical lines cold not be displayed. The present invention, in a specific example thereof, without increasing the amount of memory required, generates vertical lines to connect each of the points or horizontal line segments.Specifically, this example of the invention is arranged to receive a line of data detect the starting and stopping positions of data in the received line of data, initiate the generation of a rise line at a position corresponding to a detected starting position and a fall line at a position one display element past a detected stopping position, receive a second line of data, terminate said rise line if in the second line of data there is data in the position preceding the position of said rise line, terminate said fall line if in the second line of data there is data in the same position as the fall line, detect the starting and stopping positions of data in said second line of data, initiate a rise line in the position corresponding to the starting position of data in said second line of data unless said position also corresponds to the position of said fall line, initiate a fall line one position past the stopping position of the data in the second line unless said position one space past stopping position corresponds to a rise line, and produce an output indicative of the data, each rise line. and each fall line, this sequence of operations being repeated for successive lines of data. Thus, in one of its applications, the present invention allows ariy single valued function such as a sine wave, a series of step functions, or an exponential waveform, to be stored as discrete points or horizontal line segments, yet to be displayed as a continuous function. The invention, together with objects, features and advantages thereof, will best be understood from consideration of the following detailed descriptions of two exemplary embodiments of the invention which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings where Figure 1 shows the circuit diagram of a first exemplary embodiment of the invention Figure 2 shows 20 X 20 display matrix in which display elements corresponding to actual data values are marked with a star and display elements depicting interpolated connecting data are marked with a slash Figures 3 to 8 show the pulse trains that would appear at various marked points in the circuit of Figure 1 when data corresponding to the fifth, sixth through ninth, tenth, eleventh through fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth through twentieth scan lines, respectively,of Figure 2 are processed Figure 9 shows the circuit diagram of a second exemplary embodiment of the invention Figure 10 is a representation of data points in a display matrix Figure 11 is a graphical representation of the data points of Figure 10 with vertical connecting data points interpolated in accordance with the invention and Figure 12 is a chart showing the pulse trains appearing at various marked points within the circuit of Figure 9 when the data of Figure 10 is processed there through. The embodiment of the invention hereinafter described with reference to Figures 1 to 8 is adapted to iiiterpolate data assembled for dispLay in a cathode ray tut e display matrix comprising a plurality of individually nddressable horizontal scan lines each considered as comprising a plurality of individually addressable display elements or points spaced along the length ol the scan line.Data is stored in a memory having a number of individually addresable word storage locations corresponding to the number of display dements in a scan line, each of the word storage locations having a bit capacity capable of providing a unique data bit combination address for each of the scan lines. The memory is scanned by serially addressing the word storage locations each time interrogating the word storage location as regards its scan line information content so that there is outputted to the circuit according to the invention a series of pulse trains each corresponding to a respective scan line and each providing information for selectively energizing the display elements in that scan line.By this means1 the data in the memory is displayed as a series of horizontal lines on the display matrix the function of the circuit according to the invention is to interpolate the data from the memory so as to display vertical interconnecting lines at those points of the display where the displayed function would otherwise show a discontinuity corresponding to the line scan information of two adjacent word storage locations of the memory being different. Referring to Figure 1, the memory is shown at 10 and is connected as shown to provide output trains of pulsesD to flip flop 20 which also receives a clock input. Flip flop 20 provides one output D which corresponds to the input D delayed by one clock pulse, and a second outputD which is the inverse of D . An EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 is connected to receive inputs from the memory 10 and from the D output of flip flop 20 and to provide a corresponding input to AND gate 28 which receives further inputs from a clear line 30 and from a line 32. A second AND gate 44 is connected to receive the 1 output of flip flop 20, the clear signal from line 30, a D input from memory 10 via an inverter 14 and a recilculatory signal R the purpose of which will be explained hereinafter.The outputs A andB respectively of AND gates 44 and 28 are coupled to provide inputs to NOR gate 40 which provides an output to a shift register 34. An output 18 to the cathode ray tube display is taken via OR gate 16which has inverting inputs coupled to the D output of flip flop 20, to the output of inverter 14 providing D, and to the output ofNOR gate 40. As mentioned above the circuit illustlated in Figure 1 is designed to generate vertical connecting lines between horizontal data lines. In operation, the circuit will determine the beginning and end of each horizontal line of data. Although there are many ways of accomplishing this, the circuit of Figure 1 is arranged to delay the line of data received from the memory by one clock pulse and compare the delayed line of data with the actual line of data. As will be seen note Figure 3, lines D and D , only a position corresponding to the first point of a line of data and a position one clock pulse past the last point of actual data will have a high pulse in one of these two lines and low in the other. By virtue of EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26, a line of data with high pulses only at the beginning and end of the data line can be generated. This line of interpolated data is then stored in shift register 34 which has the same number of storage positions as there are display elements in a scan line. The determination of the beginning and end of a horizontal line of data is then used in subsequent scan lines to generate a vertical line below the beginning and end of the horizontal line or individual data point.In the described embodiment, the data stored in the shift register is recilculated, in synchronisation with the clock pulse, through a recirculating loop during the following scan line. At some point ill the recirculating loop, a connection is made to tho video display so that the vertical connecting line data generated by the EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 cut be displ aycd in the subsequent scan line. When the vertical connecting line descends to another scaii line which has an end of a horizontal line of data or individual point of data that intersects or connects with tic vertical connecting liiic, the connecting line is cut off. Because the described embodiment extends each horizontal line or individuel data point by one position when it creates the delayed line of data, the vertical connecting line is recirculated until it would overlap an actual data point or a delayed data point. When this coincidance occurs, the two horizontal lines have been connected and the data which causes the vertical line is removed from the recirculation l ath.In the Figure 1 embodiment, the recirculating connecting line signal from the shift register 34 is compared with data D from memory 10 and with data D delayed by one clock pulse from flip flop 20 in AND gate 44 to check for this coincidence. If there is a high signal on the D data or the 5. data in the same position as a high pulse from the shift register 34, then the high pulse from the shift register is removed.Thus, the vertical connecting line is terminated. A further horizontal line of data or a further data point read into the circuit should not generate a vertical connecting line below one of its end positions if a vertical connecting line has already been generated above it. For example, in Figure 2 a vertical line extending below the first data point of line 74 should not be created. That is, the circuit must be able to ascertain whether a data point has already been connected to a data point in a higher scan line, or whether a descending vertical must be generated to connect it to a data point in a lower scan line.Although there are many ways in which this could be done, the described embodiment docs this by comparing the data indicative of the beginning and end of a horizontal line of data1 i.e., the output from the EXCLUSIVE OR gate ZG, with the contents of the shift register at the correspondil position. If there is already data in the shift register at te position corresponding to an ehd of a horizontal data line, AND gate 28 blocks the passage of the high pulse indicative of an end of a horizontasl data line from the EXCLUSIVE OR gate 2G to the shift register 34. In this manner, the signal indicative of an end of a horizontal line is barred from being placed ill storage in shift register 34. The specific operation of the circuit of Figure 1 can best be illustrated by following through the generation of an exemplary visual display. By way of example, the generation of the 20 by 20 display of Figure 2 is explained below. The display elements marked with a star correspond to actual data values stored in memory 10, and the display elements marked with a slash correspond to the connecting data interpolated by the circuit.Figures 3 to 8 illustrate the pulse trains which appear at various positions in tlie circuit thus D represents the data from memory 10 on line 12, D represents this data delayed by one clock pulse as it would appear on line 22, R represents data stored in the shift register as it would appear emerging from inverter 46, A represents the data emerging from AND gate 44, B represents the data emerging from AND gate 28 and V represents the output on line 18 which connects to the video or other display unit. Looking to Figure 1, the memory 10 contains one storage word for each element of resolution along a raster scan line Each storage word is made up of a sufficient number of bits for each one of the raster scan lines in a frame to be uniquely addressed. The number of bits per storage word is the power to which 2 must be raised to have a value equal to or greater than the number of scan lines in the example illustrated in Figure 2, a 20 by 20 display scrcen is shown, i.e., there are n scan lines per frame and 20 resolvable display elements per scan line.In this example, there would be 20 storage words, each storage word having five bits of information.If only four bits were used t t all 20 scan lines could not be uniquely addressed because each storage word could only take on sixteen different magnitudes. Each of the 20 storage words is addressed one at a time ill sequence with the clock pulses to generate a series of high and low pulses out of memory 10 on line 12 into the data interpolation circuit. If none of the 20 storage words in the memory has a magnitude corresponding to the first scan line, then a line of 20 low pulses is clocked out on line 12. All values being low, no display will appear on the cathode ray tube. In the example of Figure 2, there will be no data read until the fifth scan line. In the fifth scan line, the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth storage words each have a magiiitude corresponding to the fifth scan line, i.e., fifteen lines from the bottom of the screen. Accordingly, the series of clocked high and low pulses on line 12 will appear as four low pulses followed by six high pulses followed by four low pulses, one high pulse and five low pulses as is shown in Figure 3 line D. This pulse train will be fed into inverter 14 where each high will be turned to a low and each low to a high. From inverter 14 the signals pass to OR gate 16 which has inverting inputs such that each high will now be turned back to a low and vice versa. An OR gate with inverting inputs in logic is the equivalent of a NAND gate, which is the gate that would normally be used in building the circuit. Tlic output on line 18 to a cathode ray tube will then cause tie fifth through tenth and fourteenth phosphor display element in the fifth scan line to be illuminated. Further, this train of pulses will be fed to D type flip flop 20. Fiip flop 20 has two outputs. The first, I is the same as the input line of pulses except that each pulse is deplayed by one clock pulse. That is, instead of the fifth through tenth and fifteenth pulses being high, the sixth trough eicventh and sixteenth output pulses from flip flop 22 are high and the rest are low as illustrated in Figure 3, line D . Flip flop 20 has a second output 24 which is the inverse of output 22, i.e.each high on 22 is low on 24 and each low on 22 is high on 24. Output 24 is also fed to NAND gate 16. This would have the effect, in the example, of creating positive output pulses for phosphors 6 through 11 and 16 as illustrated in Figure 3, line V. The net effect of this is to extend each data point of a data line by one element. D , that is the input data delayed by one clock pulse signal which appears on line 22, and the input data signalD from line 12 are both fed to EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26.EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 will produce a high output pulse whenever the pulse from data D is high and the corresponding pulse from data delayed by one clock pulse, D , is low, i.e., at the beginning of a horizontal line of data, or when the pulse on data D is low and the corresponding pulse on data delayed by one clock pulse D is high, i.e.one clock pulse past the end of a horizontal line of data. The output of EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 goes to AND gate 28 as does a signal on clear line 30 which will always be high except at those times when it is desired to clear the data and restart. Also put into AND gate 28 is the signal R on line 32.R is the output of shift register 34. Thus, at each clock pulse there will be an outputU on line 36 only if the input data and the data delayed by one clock pulse in the correspoluding position are one high and one low and when there is no data already present in the shift register at this position. In tile example, then, the output B in the fifth line would consist of four low pulses, one high pulse at position 5, low pulses at positions 6 through 10, one high pulse at position 11, low pulses at positions 12 through 14, two high pulses in positions 15 and 16, and low pulses to the end of the scan as is illustrated in Figure 3, line B.Onis data B on line 36 is fed into NOR gate 40 which conceptually can be thought of as all OR gate with an inverter on its output. Data on line 42 would be fed into 20 bit shift register 34 where it would be stored in inverse form and to NAND gate 16 which would again produce signals indicating that tic phosphor at positions 5, 11, 15 and 16 of the scan line should be illuminated. Thus, through gates 26, 28 and 40 a signal indicative of the beginning and end of each data point or line of data within a raster scan line are determined and the information stored in shift register 34. The data in shift register 34 is recirculated so that the data stored in it will be displayed on the next raster scan. The recirculation path is through AND gate 44 which removes data from the recirculation at appropriate times. AND gate 44 has a first input connected to inverter 46 which inverts the output of the shift register 34, ie, supplies a series of high and low pulses from shift register 34 which were fed into the shift register from NOR gate 40 in the preceding raster scan line. In the l resent example the line currently in dis ussion, line 5, is the first line with data on it.Thus, the shift register had been empty of data until this time so the signal train R from the shift register 34 via inverter 4G is a series of 20 1 low pulses. A second input to ANI gate 44 is from inverter 14 which supplies the inverse of the input data D. A third input is from output 24 of flip flop 20 which supplies the inverse of the input data delayed by one clock pulse. The final input to AND gate 44 is from clear line 30 which, as indicated above, during normal operation is always high.The output, A, from AND gate 44 will only be high if R is high and on the corresponding clock pulse there is no data coming in on line 12 nor was there any data preceding clock pulse on line 12. Thus, the data in shift register 34 will continue to be recirculated through AND gate 84, through NOR gate 40, and back into shift register 34 in the same position until there is a high in the string of values D or D at the corresponding clock pulse. In this manner, a descending display line is terminated when it meets an adjacent data point. Now going to the sixth line of Figure 2, it will be seen that none of the 20 storage words in the memory 10 has an output on this raster scan line so that the data train D on line 12 will consist of a string of 20 lowpulses as illustrated in Figure 4, line D. Thus, the line through gates 14 and 16 will produce no highs on line 18. Similarly, the train of pulses from flip flop 20 on data delayed by one clock pulse on line 22 will similarly be a string of 20 zeros as illustrated inFigure 4, line D , while the inverse of D delayed by one clock pulse on line 24 will be a string of 20 high pulses. EXCLUSIVE OR gate 2G will have low pulses applied to both its inputs to all 20 clock pulses of this scan line. Accordingly its output will be low for the entire scan line as will AND gate 28, see Figure 4, line B. It will be remembered that in the preceding line, shift register 34 had data entered into it in the 5th, with, 15th and lGth pulse positions. Accordingly, gate 44 will have a strilig of 20 high pulses applied on its second input, i.e., the inverse of the input data, and on its third input, i.c., the inverse of the input data delayed by one line, but on its first input, it will have a I ow value from the shift register 34 for the first four values then a high on the 3th, 11th, 15th, and 16th clock positions.The output will be the same as this inputThe output will be fed through NOR gate 40, which inverts the output, fed into line 42, see Figure 4, line A, and beth restared in the shift register 34 and fed to NAND gate 16 to produce high output pulses on scan line 18 at the 5th, 11th, 15th and 16th clock pulse positions as illustrated in Figure 4, line V. In the example of Figure 2, the same events will occur in scan lines 7, 8 and 9 as in scan line 6. In the tenth line, the data stored in the 20 storage words of memory 10 has a magnitude corresponding to the tenth line in data positions 1, 2, 3 und 4 and 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 as illustrated in Figure 5, line D. Thus the line through gates 14 and 16 provide high output signals in these nine clock pulse positions on output line 18.Additionally, the output on 24 of flip flop 20 will cause gate 10 to supply a high output pulse to the 5th clock pulse position, and were the 2ist position not cut off would have supplied an additional high pulse there also. EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 will produce a high output pulse.in tlic just, 5th, and 16th positions. AND gate 28 receives high inputs from EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 only on the 1st, 5th and 16th clock pulse positions. The shift register signal R is high in the 5th and 16th positions from the 9th scan line. Thus R is low in the 5th and 16th positions. Accordingly, the oiiLy output from AND gate 28 is a high in the 1st clock pulse position with positions 2 through 20 low as illustred in Figure 5, line B. Th it can be seen that these two additional lines of data points have produced the input to shift register 34 which is required to cause a vertical connecting line in the first element of the scan line only. No other vertical lines will be extending below any of the other data points read in on line 10. Now looking to the recirculate line, AND gate 44 has an input signal R which is high only in positions 5, 11, 15 and 16 as illustrated in Figure 5, line R. In the 5th position, it will be noticed that data inverse delayed by one clock pulse is low. Accordingly, the vertical line 52 of display points that have been generated by shift register 34 is cut off. Looking to position 11 it will be noted that the data inverse and data delayed by one clock pulse inverse are both high. Accordingly, descending line 56 will be recircl lated to the shift register 34 and will be continued in subsequent lines.The same is true for position 15. In position 16, howeve data inverse is low. Thus, descending line 68 is also cut off. The composite output of AND gate 44 is illustrated in Figure 5, line A. Similarly on scan lines 11, 12, 13 and 14, there will be no data or data delayed by one line. The only output will be from the data recirculating through shift register 34 on the path through AND gate 44 which causes high output pulses on line 18 in positions 1, 11 and 15. Thus causing descending lines 56, 70 and 72 to continue downward.See Figure 6. Upon reaching scan line 15, data point 74 is read in from memory 10 in the 11, 12, 13 and 14th positions. SeeFigure 7. This data will similarly cause lines 56 and 70 to be terminated. And only the line 72 at first position will be continued all the way to the bottom of the screen. Thus, by reading only the twenty data points corresponding to the display elements marked with a star, in a memory or other data handling circuit, the circuit ofFigure 1 is able to generate all the connecting data necessary to turn the display into the continuous fuiiction of Figure 2. Many alternatives are available to the circuit of Figure 1. foi example, it will be noted that from scan 3 ille 1 to the eiid of Figure 2, tlie circuit, with the exception of position 1, is in the same state as at the beginning of the display generation, Thus an additional single valued function could he displayed on the remaining scan liiies. If a display Of sufficient size were used and the fontions to be displayed were not allowed to moet or cross a plurality of functions could be made continuous and displayed simultaneously. For example, the top half of the display could be a reference functioii and the lower part one or more test results. The data comiiig through EXCLUSIVE OR gate 26 and AND gate 28 supplies the recirculate data to shift register 34 and also contributes to the output on line 18. However, it will be noticed that this contribution A to the output is always redundant with data from line 24 or on the line through gates 14 and 16. Accordingly, contribution to the output signal from the recirculate liiie can be taken from between AND gate 44 and NOR gate 40, fed through an inverter, and to NAND gate 16. Another alternative is to sample the recirculated data as it emerges from shift register 34 at line 32. This will cause redundant data at the intersection of a vertical aiid horizontal lines such as grid point 60 of Figure 2, however, the output on line 18 will be unchaiiged. Other changes include replacing NAND gate 16 with an OR gate without inverting inputs 1 connecting line 22 rather than 24 to the OR gate, moving inverter 14 to the input of AND gate 44 and coiiecting the output of AND gate 44 to the third input of the OR gate. There are so many other minor modifica tions which would be obvious to the appropriately skilled reader and which caii be made to create redundaiit data or eliminate redulldallt data, that it is impractical to list them all herein. Still other slight modifications can be made which will 10 15 20 25 30 35 modify the display so slightly that its utility is not degraded and it still appears as a continuous function. or example, if line 24 were disconnected from NAND gate 16, oiily shifted data points at the right end of a horizontal line with the vertical connecting line extending from above, such as grid point 60, would be ost. This corner point could be regained by shifting the input toNAND gate 16 from line 42 to line 32 but at the expense of losing the corner point at the right end of a horizontal line from which point the vertical connecting line extends down such as grid points 54 or 66. Other circuits can be added to remove the vertical line 72 in Figure 2 or the display means could be adjusted to display only positions 2 to the end, i.e.drop position 1. It will be appreciated that the memory 10 need not be digital. Instead, an analog memory could be used.Then the analog voltage storage corresponding to each position could be addressed one at a time and the voltage at each position compared to a voltage range corresponding to the particular scan line. In a system which has a continuous input for each position, a memory is not even needed. For example, a system with a set of five detectors which generate an output voltage indicative of a physical property, such as thickness of a work piece, could produce a set of analog voltages as long as the work piece remained adjacent the detectors. This removes the need for a memory.To produce a 20 by 20 display from such a system, the analog voltage outputs, whether directly fom the detectors or from a memory, would be addressed sequentially each for four consecutive clock julses to stretch each piece of data to four positions . dach addressed output voltage would be compared with a mange of values corresponding to the scan line being generated and if within the range a high output produced. This would produce a display of five horizontal line segment which the prsent invention would join into a continuous fonction for easier viewing. A second embodiment of the invention which is arranged to perform a function similar to the performed by the first embodiment above described is shown in Figure 9.The construction and operation of the second embodiment will be apparent from the following Looking to Figure 9, data in the form of a series of high and low pulse trains1 tie number of pulses in each train corresponding to the number of resolvable display elements in one scan line of a data display matrix, come into the circuit on line. This series of pulses is designated as A and corresponds to the pulses from memory 10 in the embodiment of Figure 1. The data A is fed into a flip flop switch 12 which is sequenced by clock pulses.An output B from flip flop switch 12 is the data A delayed by one clock pulse. Data A and B are both fed to an EXCLUSIVE OR gate 14.The series of output pulses from gate 14, designated C, are high whenever one, but not both, of the pulses in the corresponding clock position of signals A and B is high.C is low whenever the pulses in the corresponding positions in A and B are the same, i.e., either both are high or both are low. Signals C and A are fed to the inputs of invertingAND gate 16. The output signal D is low whenever the corresponding pulses in A and C are both high, otherwise the output pulse of D is high. It will be noticed thatD will be high in all positions except those corresponding to a single high pulse in the pulse train A or in the position corresponding to the first high pulse in a string or sequential high pulses in pulse train A. Thus, the signal D marks the position at which the circuit will generate a rise line to connect the actual data points.Similarly, signals C and B are fed to inverting AND gate 18 to create an output signal K. Signal E will indicate the positioii of a fall line. Signal E will be high for all inputs except for those pulses which are in the position corresponging to the last high pulse in a line of high pulses in signal B or corresponding to a single high pulse in signal B. Thus, the fall line is created one clock pulse past the end of a series of high clock pulses in pulse train A. Going back to the rise generator circuit, there is an AND OR INVERT gate 20 which is composed of two AND gates 22 and 24 and an inverting OR gate 26. The similarity of this structure to the gates 44, 28, 40 ofFigure 1 will be noted. One input to AND gate 22 is the pulse train F stored in shift register 30 from the last scan line which has been inverted with an inverter 32.A second input is signal D from inverting AND gate 16.A third input is a signal K from an inverting AND gate 34 which serves to compare the data from shift register 30 indicative of the rise time stored from the preceding scan line with input data stored in a shift register 58 from the previous scan line which will be low only when the rise line is to be terminated. Signal K will be explained in more detail later. A fourth and final input to AND gate 22 is a clear signal from clear line 36. The clear signal will be high during all normal operations of the circuit and will only go low when it is desired to erase or reset the circuit. AND gate 22, then, passes the rise indication signals on through, except in two situations. The first situation is when there is already data stored in shift register 30 in the position corresponding to the rise line. The second situation is when there is both a low signal in the corresponding position in shift register 30 and there is a high signal from a flip flop 38. It will be seen that the signal from flilo flop 38, desigtlated U , represents the actual input data A from the recedillg scan line delayed by one clock pulse. Thus, the rise line will not be generated if there is n high signal in the preceding scai line in the position one clock pulse before the proposed rise line position. AND gate 24 also has four inputs. The first is signalA, the second signal C, the third is the inverse of the output G of a shift register 50 which will be high in all positions except the position in which there is a fall line being generated , and the fourth is the clear signal. AND gate 24, then, will generate a high output pulse only wheii the corresponding position of signal A is high aiid signal B is low and the fall line signal G is high. Inverting OR gate 26 combines the outputs of AND gates 22 and 24 to produce a signal F which will be high under all conditions except in the pulse position corresponding to the position of a rise line, either being started with this line of ciata or being recirculated from a previous line of data. The signal F is then stored in sift register 30 which has one storage position for each element of resolution of a scan line. Shift register 30 is sequenceed by a clock pulse generator such that ill each scan line the data already in shift register 30 is stepped out one pulse at a time and sequenced with the new input data arriving on line 10. Thus, the output F of shift register 30 is a pulse train one scan line delayed from the data being read. The data from shift register 30 passes through inverter 32, from which the information is recirculated back to AND gate 22 and on to OR gate 52. This will create an output signal on line 54. In the clock pulse position corresponding to the position if any of a rise line in the last scan line, there will be a high pulse. In the fall generator circuit, AND OR INVERT gate 40 is made up of an AND gate 42, second AND gate 44, and an inverting OR gate 46. Just as in AND OR INVERT gate 20, the two ANI gates each ascertain whether or not one of the two alternative conditions are met for generating terminating a fall line. T1le two conditions are combined in inverting OR gate 46. This output, designed signal G, will have a high output pulse in the position corresponding to the position in which a fall line is to be started in the next scan line.In the next scan line, the outputG from shift register 50 is passed through inverter 56 and recirculated back to AND gate 42 as well as passed to OH gate 52 to create an output on line 54 which has a high pulse at those positions corresponding to a fall line stored in shift register 50. The real data A coming in on line 10 is also fed to shift register 58. The real data is stored there for one scan and is fed out of shift register 58 in the subsequent scan line. This real data delayed by one scan line is designated as data A . The data A goes to flip flop 38, discussed above, where it is delayed by one clock pulse to produce signal B . The signal B is fed to inverting AND gate 34, discussed above, and to OR gate 52. This produces output pulses on line 54 which are high in positions corresponding to one clock pulse past high pulses in the actual data A read in the preceding scan line. The output A from shift register 58 is further fed to inverting AND gate 62 which produces a signal L analogous to signal K, discussed above, in the rise line generating situation.Signal L stops the recirculation of fall line data back into shift register 50 when the fall line reaches a high pulse in the data A in the same position. This cuts off fall lines. The circuit of Figure 9 can perhaps be most fully understood by following a set of data through it. The example which follows will outline how the circuit will transform the ciata poiiits shown in Figure 10 into the continuous visual display shown in Figure 11. The example will show a 7 X 7 input array and a 7 X 8 scan line output array. These are much smaller arrays than would normally be used in practice and are chosen this small for smplicity of illustration.This data could be stored in a memory made up of seven storage elements one for each of the seveii resolution positions per scan line each element having three bits of storage 2 8 so that each of the seven scan lines can be uniquely addressed . Thus a total of twenty one bits of storage are used much less than the forty nine bits of storage that a 7x7 array of one bit memory elements would use. Figure 12 illustrates the signaLs at various labeled points in the above circuit duriiig each of the eigit scan lines.By way of convention, zeros are used to denote a low pulse and ones a high pulse. Although the term pulse will be used throughout, it is to be understood that a string of seven low pulses would be merely a continuous low voltage on the line during each cloclc pulse, and a series of high pulses would be actually a continuous high voltage on the line during the appropriate number of clock pulses. Considering Figures 10, 11 and 12 Figure 10 can be regarded as seven memory words, each word capable of having any one of seven values. It will be seen that in the first scan line of Figure 10 there is no data, i.e. none of th e data words has a value of seven. Accordingly, the input A to the circuit during the first scan line would be all low pulses. This data or lack of data would have no effect on tile circuit and would produce an output of all low pulses. In the second line of Figure 10, it will be seen that there are three bits of data which will produce the string of input data shown in the second column scan line 2 of Figure 12. It will be seen that during the second scan line the inverting AND gate 16 produces a signal D which indicates the position for the rise line by having a low pulse in its third position, the position corrcsponding to the beginning of the line of data. Further, through AND OR INVERT gate 20, this position indication from signal D is also transferred to signal F.Similarly, signal R detects the position for a fall line and, throughAND OR INVERT gate 40, transfers this information to signal G. Signals F and G are then stored in shift registers 30 and 50, respectively. The output, it will be seen, is actually oc scan line delayed. The signal r3, F , andG will all be low. Accordingly, there will be no output displayed in the second scan line. Looking to the third line of Figure 10, it will be seen that there is no data represented on that line. Accordingly, the input to the circuit will be a string of all low pulses as illustrated in Figure 12, column 3. It will be seen, then, that signals D and E will indicate no rise or fall lines. Signal F, however, is a composite, not only of the input from the signal D but from the recirculating line, through which the data in shift register 30 can be returned to the input of AND OR INVERT gate 20 and repeated in subsequent signals F. Similarly, the data in shift register 50 is recirculated onto subsequent signals G.It will be seen, then, that the output on line 54 will be high at the pulse positions, that B is high, or F is high, or is high. Thus, the data read in in scan line 2 is now displayed as the three blocks of line 3 ofFigure 11 marked with a star. Alsa, the first rise line point is displayed as the square in line 3 of Figure 11 marked with an X. Further, it will be seen that the information concerning the rise and fall lines in signals F1 and G have been recirculated back into shift registers 30 and 50 respectively so that that information has been retained It will be seen that in Figure 10, the fourth scan liiie c d also has no data. Accordingly, the input to the circuit will again be a string of all low pulscs.Again, there being no new data, signals D and E will generate no new rise or falllines. The signals F and G which indicate the location of the rise and fall lines respectively will be recirculated back into their respective shift registers and retained. The output in this scan line is again high in the positions corresponding to pulses in any one ofB , F , or G . In this case, that would be a high pulse at the rist and fall line positions, which is to say, positions 3 and 6 respectively marked witll an X in line 4 of Figure 11. Going on to the fifth line of Figure 10 column 5 ofFigure 12 , it will be seen that there are data points to be read in the first two positions. Thus, the input pulse to the circuit will be two high pulses in the first two positions. Because of the new input data, signal D will indicate a rise line position and signal E a fall line position. The signal F, it will be seen, will have the old rise line position recirculated back into it and have the new position from signal D added to it. This produces a new signal F for storage in shift register 30 which indicates two rise lines. The new fall line position indicated by signal E will not however, appear as part of signal G.It will be seen that signal G would have had this fall line added to it, except that the second half of the expression for G from AND gate 44 acts as a filter which filters out fall lines which are in the same position as a currently existing rise line. Thus, the new fall line indicated in signal E is not passed to signal G. Signal G has only the previous fall line from signal G recirculated back into itself. The output for line 5 will again be high in those clock pulse positions corresponding to high pulses in any one of B , F or G .In this case, that would again be only tic rise and fall lines generated in the previous scan liiic in the third and sixth positions. In line 6 of Figure 10, it will be seen that there are again two more data points to be read in. Signal D generates a rise line signal indication, but signal , because the new data isat the end of the line, is unable to generate a possible fall line position. The new rise line in the fifth position of signal D is prohibited by AND gate 24 of AND OR INVERT gate 20 from being put into signalF. AND gate 24 prohibits formation of a rise line in the same position as an existing fall line. T1 this case, there already was a fall line in the sixth position and, accordingly the new rise line was filtered out.Gate 34 has also detected the coincidence in the third position of a pulse of delayed input data, signal B , and an indication of a rise line in signal F , signal K, the output of gate 34, then goes low in the third position. SignalK in AND gate 22 of AND OR INVERT gate 20 acts to block the signal indicative of the rise line in the third position from being recirculated. Accordingly, the new signalF will only have a low pulse in the first position to indicate one rise line. Signal G is recirculated unaffected.The output again is high in those pulse positions corresponding to a high pulse in any one of signals B , F1, or G.This produces the output shown by X s and stars in the sixth line of Figure 11. In line 7, it will be seen that Figure 10 supplies no input data. Inverting AND gate 62 will detect that data rad in the previous line had a high pulse in the sixth position and that signal G indicated a fall line in the sixth position. Gate 62, through signal L, causesAND gate 42 to cut off the recirculation of this fall line,The output on line 54 then will have a high pulse in the first position from the recirculating rise line, a high pulse in the sixth position from the fall line which was just ciit off, and a high pulse in the soveiitli position from the high pulse input in line 6 in tlic sixth position. There is no line 8 of Figure 10 accordingly, there would be no input data. There having been no input for two lines, shift register 58 is empty. Since the fall line was cut off in the previous line, shift register 5 0 has no data. The oiily output is from the recirculating rise line iii the first position from shift register 30. Thus, it can be sceil that the circuit of Figure 9 connects horizontal line segments of single valued functions into a continuous line representation. The above discussion has been in terms of horizontal lines of data. It will be appreciated that the discussion is just as relevaiit to iiidividual data points. In working with discrete points of data, the circuit doubles each data point, i.e., puts it on two adjacent horizontal positions and connects subsequent data points with vertical lines.Within the resolution of the display device, this will accurately approximate a curve single valued in the scan direction of virtually any shape. For any waveform single valued in a direction parallel to the scan lines, the present invention generates all the necessary vertical lines to connect discrete data points into a continuous waveform. This invention is applicable to any x, y matrix type display not just cathode ray tubes. The invention is applicable to plasma display panels, all television type displays, electrostatic ink or thermal recorders which scan across the paper incrementing scan lines in step with paper motion, and ink jet recorders among others. Further, the present invention is capable of displaying a plurality of non overlapping single value waveforms on the single cathode ray tube or other x, y type matrix.Under certain conditions, it is possible for tiie plurality of single value waveforms to touch or cross without disrupting the display, but in most situations touching or crossing would disrupt the display.
