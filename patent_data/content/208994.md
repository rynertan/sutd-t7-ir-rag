## Description
This invention relates to novel bornane 3 spiro 1 cyclopentanes and perfume compositions comprising the same. At present, perfume materials do not greatly rely on natural matters, but depend chiefly on synthetic perfumes in order to meet various requirements, such as stabilities in supply and quality, low cost and the like. However, with regard to woody note to which the present invention is directed, natural perfumes are predominantly used. Taking an increasing demand in future into consideration, the shortage of the natural perfumes is unavoidable. Therefore, it is important to supply synthetic perfumes which emit woody note. In general, most compounds having woody note have complicated polycyclic structures, typical of which are sesqui terpenes, making it difficult to industrially produce such compounds. Among these polycyclic compounds, tricyclic compounds are particularly difficult to prepare. We have made extensive studies on the assumption that if readily available bicyclic monoterpenes are used to prepare tricyclic compounds, the preparation becomes very easy. As a result, we have succeeded in obtaining novel compounds having woody note from camphor which is stable with respect to cost and supply. The present invention is accomplished on the basis of the above success. The present invention provides bornane 3 spiro 1 cyclopentane derivatives of the following formula I , The compounds I of the invention are prepared, for example, according to the following reaction scheme The reaction of forming a spiro ring in the first stage is effected according to the procedure described, for example, in A. P. Krapcho, Synthesis, 383 1974 . More particularly, camphor and a 1,4 dihalogenobutane are heated and agitated in the presence of a base and a suitable solvent, thereby obtaining compound Ia . Examples of the 1,4 dihalogenobutanes include 1,4 dichlorobutane, 1,4 dibromobutane, and 1,4 diiodobutane. Because the chloro product is less reactive and the iodo product is expensive, the dibromo product is preferably used. The bases may be any bases ordinarily used for alkylation and include, for example, alkali metal amides, alkali metal tertiary alkoxides, alkali metal hydrides and the like. Of these, sodium amide, potassium t butoxide and sodium hydrides are preferred. The solvents used for these purposes include, for example, hydrocarbons such as n hexane, n heptane and the like, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and the like, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran THF , dioxane, dimethyl cellosolve, and the like, and aprotonic, polar solvents such as dimethylformamide DMF , dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , hexamethylphosphoamide HMPA , and the like. The reduction in the second stage may be effected by any known methods which are used for reduction of ketones. Typical methods include a reduction using a metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride or sodium borohydride, and a hydrogenation reaction using a transition metal catalyst such as platinum oxide, ruthenium carbon, Cu Cr catalyst or the like. The reduction using metal hydrides can be effected according to an ordinary procedure described, for example, by L. F. Fieser M. Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Sons Inc., l967 . On the other hand, the hydrogenation reaction using metal catalysts may be effected in the absence of solvents, but may be carried out in solvents including, for example, saturated hydrocarbons such as n hexane, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and the like, or ethers such as diethyl ether, THF, dioxane and the like. The reaction temperature is in the range of from 100 C to 250 C, preferably from 150 to 250 C. According to the reduction reaction of the second stage, two isomers of the following formulas Ibx and Ibn The thus obtained compounds Ia , Ibx and Ibn of the invention have woody note. When these compounds are formulated in various substrates, useful perfume compositions can be prepared. The compounds Ia , Ibx and Ibn of the invention have all woody note which are different from one another as follows. The compound Ia has a patchouli like, slightly earthy woody fragrance with an amber tone sinilar to sage clary. The compound Ibx has a patchouli like woody amber note with a slight camphor tone. The compound Ibn has a vaguely patchouli like, woody note. As described above, the compounds of the invention have inherent odor based on woody tone and are useful as materials for various perfumes. Accordingly, they can be widely used in various articles requiring flavors or fragrances, such as high quality perfume compositions, perfumes, soaps, shampoos, hair rinses, detergents, cosmetics, sprays, aromatics and the like. The present invention is more particularly described by way of examples. 270 g 1.25 moles of 1,4 dibromobutane was added, at room temperature, to a solution of a mixture of 152 g 1 mol of dl camphor, 100 g of sodium amide 2.56 mols and 2 liters of n hexane. Thereafter, the mixture was agitated for 24 hours under reflux condition. After cooling down to room temperature, water was added to the mixture for separation into two phases. The organic phase was neutralized and washed with a dilute hydrochloric acid solution, followed by washing with a saturated sodium thiosulfate solution, then with a saturated sodium carbonate solution, and twice with water. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent was distilled off, followed by distillation under reduced pressure to obtain a pure product.
