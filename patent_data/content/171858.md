## Description
METHOD OF WAKING SILICON CARBIDE AND COATINGS OF SILICON CARBIDE ON CARBONACEOUS SUBSTRATES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Silicon carbide is prepared commercially by the reaction of silicon dioxide with coke in an electric furnace at about 18000C. The reaction may be written as follows EMI1.1 It is also known that elemental silicon can be directly reacted with carbon to form silicon carbide at temperatures in the order of about 1400 C. Other methods for formina silicon carbide include the pyrolysis of compounds containing silica and carbon.The pyrolitic technique may be used with tricbloromethyl silane vapor and hydrogen or a mixture of silicon tetrachloride vapor and a suitable hydrocarbon vapor, such as toluene, and hyd,rogen are introduced into an argon plasma between concentric electrodes. In the hot plasma the compounds decompose into elements that upon coolina form the most stable species, i.e., silicon carbide and hydrochloric acid. Coatings of silicon carbide have been deposited on substrates us in9 various vapor phase deposition techniques. The applicants have discovered that silicon and a carbonaceous material may be directly reacted in the presence of an inorganic fluoride salt at temperatures below those reouired if the salt were not present.Depending on the length of time that the reaction is run and the nature of the carbonaceous substrate, a silicon carbide product or silicon carbide coating may be obtained.In addition, SiC whiskers and fibers can be grown by using this invention. Accordingly, it is a primary object of this invention to provide a novel process for making silicon carbide. It is also an object of this invention to provide a novel process for forming a silicon carbide coating on a carbonaceous substrate. It is also an object of this invention to provide a novel process for forming a silicon carbide coating on a carbon fiber or a carbon foil to modify the chemical, mechanical or electrical properties of said fiber or foil. It is also an object of this invention to provide a novel process to form carbides of other elements such as B, Ti, Zr, and other transition metals. These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from a preview of the specifications herein. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a photomicrograph of silicon carbide formed according to Example 1. FIG. 2 is a photomicrograph of silicon carbide formed according to Example 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ItRENTION The applicants process for the production of silicon carbide comprises a forming a reaction mixture which comprises a carbon source, a silicon source, and at least one inorganic fluoride salt and b heating said reaction mixture for a sufficient time at an elevated temperature to cause silicon carbide to form. When the process is used to place a layer of silicon carbide on a carbonaceous article, the carbonaceous article forms a part of the reaction mixture as it is the substrate for the formation of the layer of silicon carbide. The carbonaceous substrate may comprise graphite, articles such as rods, vessels and the like, carbon fibers, such as graphite fibers, graphite foil, graphite felt, coke, carbon sponge, glassy carbon, charcoal, etc. By selection of the appropriate size of the carbonaceous substrate and using the proper conditions of temperature, pressure and time, complete conversion of the carbonaceous substrate to silicon carbide may be effected. When a silicon carbide coating is formed on a graphite substrate it strengthens the substrate particularly in the case of graphite fibers, felts and foils. The process requires the presence of a source of silicon, either as elemental silicon or a compound that is capable of liberatina elemental silicon under the conditions of the reaction or in the presence of a compound that reacts with the silicon precursor to form elemental silicon. The silicon Drecursors include silicon dioxide silica which will form silicon under the reaction condition or a silicon tetrahalide such as silicon tetrafluoride which may be reduced by an alkali mc tal, such as sodium to form elemental silicon, or a silane, organosilane, or mixtures thereof. The inorganic fluoride compound may be sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, lithium fluoride, barium fluoride, calcium fluoride, strontium fluoride, magnesium fluoride, aluminum fluoride, copper fluoride, lead difluoride, fluorosilicates, fluoroborates and mixtures thereof. Sodium fluoride is the preferred inorganic fluoride. If mixtures are used, it is advantageous to select those inorganic fluorides that will form a eutectic and permit the use of lower reaction temperatures. For example a mixture of equal parts of lithium fluoride, sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride form a eutectic that melts around 7500C. It is also contemplated that non fluoride salts may be employed as diluents for the inorganic fluoride salts. Generally it is feasible to employ temperatures that range from about the meltina point of the fluoride or a eutectic containing a fluoride up to about 16000C, or preferably from about 750to to about 13000C and more preferably from about 1100to to about 12000C. The reaction may be carried out for a sufficient period of time to achieve the desired results. This time may be from 1 minute to 168 hours, depending on pressure, density of the substrate and temperature. The process may be carried out at ambient pressure or if desired a vacuum as low as 1 mm H may be applied. Alternatively, the process may be carried out under a pressure of up to 100 atmospheres. Coatings of a thickness of about 0.1 to about 20 microns may be applied to high density graphite and from about 5 to 50 microns in thickness may be formed on low density graphite. The term high density as applied to graphite herein is used to describe graphite having a density of 1.9 g cc and above.. The term low density as applied to graphite herein is used to describe graphite having a density of from about 1.5 9 cc to about 1.9 g cc. The relative proportions of the reactants are not critical. Generally, it is preferred to use an excess of silicon or silicon precursor required to make the desired quantity of silicon carbide with from 0.25 to 20 1 weight ratio of the inorganic fluoride based on the amount of silicon. bepending on the temperature of operation, Si or F species can be preferentially lost by volatilization. The initial relative proportion should be tailored to maintain enough of other materials during the heat treatment. When silicon carbide granules or particles are to be made, the use of classified sizes of carbonaceous particles such as graphite may be utilized to obtain silicon carbide of a predetermined size. This method can be utilized to avoid the need to fracture and classify the silicon carbide product for use as abrasive particles or for use in making sintered silicon carbide articles. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The following examples are added to illustrate but not to limit the invention. EXAMPLE 1 The first series of studies was made by placing samples of the material to be studied along with the synthetic RP in cylindrical holes 1 cm ID x 2 cm deep cut in a graphite block. Cylindrical caps of graphite were then placed on top of the holes to decrease vapori zation. This block was then heated to about 11000C in arqon. After heating for about 1 hour, most of the NaP in the sample hole had disappeared.It seemed that the loss of NaF was due to vaporization Table 1 GRAPHITE IN Si NaF MIXTURES HEATED IN ARGON AT 11000C FOR 1 HOUR Si NaP Ratio Material Results 1 1 Graphite 1.4 g cc Material coated with a SiC layer 1 2 Graphite 1.4 g cc Material coated with a SiC layer 1 6 Graphite 1.4 g cc Material coated with a SiC layer 0 lit Graphite 1.4 g cc No visible effect 1 6 Spectroscopic Graphite Material coated with a SiC layer 1 6 Glassy Carbon Sponge Material coated with a SiC layer 1 6 SiC Single Crystal Unattacked 1 6 Blank Control EXAMPLE 2 Graphite samples were placed in a graphite block with 2 cm ID holes with tight fitting caps for the top of the holes.The samples of graphite materials were again heated in graphite block at 11700C for 35 hours. The most relevant conditions and results of this experiment are summarized in Table 2. Vaporization losses were significant.

In each compartment we loaded first graphite sample, and then we filled it with a Si NaF powder mixture. The following table describes the weight, and the type of graphite rod in each compartment in each run.Compartment A B C D E Run 1 0.35846 0.33892 0.43424 0.A4394 0.32857 Run 2 0.35794 0.39425 0.21787 0.48801 0.54793 Run 3 0.23810 0.20584 0.17289 0.19907 0.19546 Run 1 used Poco graphite HPD 3 in the form of a shaped rod having a density of about 1.9 gicm3 Run 2 used Poco graphite AXM 5Q in the form of a shaped rod 3 having a density of about 1.77 g cm and Run 3 used Poco graphite AXZ 5Q in the form of a shaped rod having a 3 density of about 1.57 g cm Compartment A also contained a 2 1 mixture of sodium fluoride to silicon Compartment B contained a 1 0 ratio of sodium fluoride to silicon Compartment C contained a 6 1 ratio of sodium fluoride to silicon Compartment D contained a 2 1 ratio of sodium fluoride to silicon and Compartment E contained a 6 1 ratio t sodium fluoride to silicon. The silicon was 99.998 pure Ventron and the sodium fluoride was reagent grade Baker . The plugs were fitted into the graphite block and the whole assembly was heated at a temperature of 11300C for 155 hours in an argon atmosphere at atmospheric pressure. The graphite block was opened and it was found that silicon carbide had formed. The two major parameters studied were Si NaF ratios and graphite density. The conditions and results of this experiment are summarized in Table 3. After this heat treatment, the graphite samples were recovered, mounted in an epoxy resin, and polished. Cross sections of the exposed graphite samples were also studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy SL and X rays fluorescence XRF . We found that for 1.90 gr cc graphite samples, the thickness of the SiC layer was greater in samples that were treated in Si NaF mixtures rich inNaF. The SiC coating was compact and thin 5 10 um for this high density graphite. For lower density graphites, the XRF Si signal could be detected inside of the graphite hundreds of microns from the surface.

It was shown that under the above conditions, a thin layer of SiC is formed on the surface of the graphite, as determined by SEM, XRF, andX ray analysis. This layer is adherent and compact for graphites with densities above 1.7 glcc, and the SiC does not penetrate into the graphite. SiC coatings also were formed on lower density graphite 1.5 g cc , but the SiC also entered into the bulk of the graphite. X ray fluorescence analysis shows that sodium species were present neither in the bulk of the graphite nor in theSiC coating.
