A projectile 10 for use in a loom in which filling picks are inserted into a warp shed from an outside supply source comprises an elongate body having an outer shell 12 . The body has an opening 16 at each end, and inside the body there is an elongate cavity which extends along the axis of the body. The cavity is divided into two filling storage chambers 26, 28 by a perforated partition 24 which extends across the longitudinal axis at an angle of less than 90 therefrom. The inlet opening 16 for one of the chambers 26,28 constitutes the outlet opening for the other chamber, for the air flow which is used to depo sit filling yarn into the chambers of the projectile.
