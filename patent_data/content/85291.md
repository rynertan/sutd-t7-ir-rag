S Lactams having aEMI14.1 substituent in the l position and an acylamino substituent in the 3 position contain at least one chiral center the carbon atom in the 3 position of the ss lactam nucleus to which the acylamino substituent is attached. This invention is directed to those B lactams which have been described above, wherein the stereochemistry at the chiral center in the 3 position of the ss lactam nucleus is the same as the configuration at the carbon atom in the 6 position of naturally occurring penicillins e.g., penicillin G and as the configuration at the carbon atom in the 7 position of naturally occurring cephamycins e.g., cephamycin C . Also included within the scope of this invention are racemic mixtures which contain the above described B lactams. B Lactams having aEMI15.1 substituent in the l position of the ss lactam nucleus and an acylamino substituent in the 3 position of the B lactam nucleus, and salts thereof, have activity against a range of gram negative and gram positive organisms. The compounds of this invention can be used as agents to combat bacterial infections including urinary tract infections and respiratory infections iii mammalian species, such as domesticated animals e.g., dogs, cats, cows, horses, and the like and humans. For combating bacterial infections in mammals a compound of this invention can be administered to a mammal in need thereof in an amount of about 1.4 mg kg dayto about 350 mg kg day, preferably about 14 mg kg day to about 100 mg kg day. All modes of administration which have been used in the past to deliver penicillins and cephalosporins to the site of the infection are also contemplated for use with the novel family of B lactams of this invention. Such methods of administration include oral, intravenous, intramuscular, and as a suppository.EMI16.1 activating group can be introduced onto the nitrogen atom of a ss lactam by reacting a ss lactam having the formulaEMI16.2 wherein A1 is a nitrogen protecting group, with the appropriate isocyanate having the formulaEMI16.3 As the protective group A1 for amino above, any of those used for this purpose in the field of ss lactam or peptide synthesis may conveniently be employed.Examples of such amino protecting group include aromatic acyl groups such as phthaloyl, p nitrobenzoyl, p tert butylbenzoyl, p tertbutylbenzenesulfonyl, benzensulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl, etc., aliphatic acyl groups such as formyl, acetyl, propionyl, monochloroacetyl, dichloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, methanesulfonyl, ethanesulfonyl, trifluoroacetyl, maleyl, succinyl, etc., and esterified carboxyl groups such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, t butoxycarbonyl, isopropoxy carbonyl, 2 cyanoethoxycarbonyl, , , ss,ss,ss trichloro ethoxycarbonyl, ss trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl, B methylsulfonylethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, di phenylmethyloxycarbonyl, methoxymethyloxycarbonyl, acetylmethyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, phenyloxycarbonyl, etc., as well as nonacyl amino protecting groups such as trityl, 2 nitrophenylthio, benzylidene, 4 nitrobenzylidene, trialkylsilyl, benzyl, p nitrobenzyl, proton, etc.The choice of amino protecting group is not critical in the present invention. The reaction is preferably run in an organic solvent.,.e.g., an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane, in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or alkyl lithium. The activating group can also be inserted onto the Formula II lactam in sequential segments.Thus for example, with reference to the activating group as represented below EMI17.1 there are various methods known in the art by which the sequential portions a , b and c above can be added to the Formula II ss lactam in single or double bond portions or all together. One such method, which is preferred omPrises first reactina a ss lactam of formula II with an isocyanate having the formula IV O C N SO2 Z wherein. Z is a leaving group, e.g., a halogen such as chlorine. The reaction is preferably run in an inert organic solvent, e.g., a halocarbon such as dichloromethane, or in acetonitrile, and yields an intermediate having the formulaEMI18.1 Reaction of an intermediate of formula V with a R5NH2 amine preferably in the form of a silylated derivative such as with a silyl compound having the formula VI EMI18.2 yields an intermediate having the formulaEMI18.3 which can be reacted with an acyl halide having the formulaEMI19.1 to yield a ss lactam having the formulaEMI19.2 Alternatively, compounds of formulas VI and VIII can be first reacted to yield a compound having the formulaEMI19.3 which can be reacted with a compound of formulaV to yield a compound of formula IX. Still another procedure for preparing a compound of formula IX wherein R6 is NR7R8, comprises reacting a compound of formula V with a urea having the formulaEMI19.4 in the presence of triethylamine. Deprotection of a compound of formula IX using conventional techniques yields the corresponding key intermediate having the formulaEMI20.1 or a salt thereof. The particular deprotection reaction used will, of course, depend on the protecting group A1 present. If, for example, A1 is a t butoxycarbonyl protecting group, deprotection can be accomplished by treatment of a compound of formula IX with acid e.g., formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid . If, for example, A1 is a benzyloxycarbonyl protesting group, deprotection can be accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation of a compound of formula IX. Well known acylation techniques can be used to convert an intermediate of formula XII to a corresponding product of formula I. It is also evident that the desired acyl group in the Formula I product can also function as the protecting group for the amino group SH2 in the Formula XII compound above, or as the A1 group in the Formula II reactant shown previously where A1 is defined as a nitrogen protecting group.In such cases, there will be no need for removing the A1 protecting group after insertion of theEMI20.2 activating group. Exemplary techniques include reaction of a compound of formula XII with a carboxylic acid R1 OH , or corresponding carboxylic acid halide or carboxylic acid anhydride. The reaction with a carboxylic acid proceeds most readily in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and a substance capable of forming an active ester in situ such asN hydroxybenzotriazole. In those instances where the acyl group R1 contains reactive functionality such as amino or carboxyl groups it may be necessary to first protect those functional groups, then carry out the acylation reaction, and finally deprotect the resulting product. In general terms, the process for preparing the desired compounds therefore comprises reacting a ss lactam having the formulaEMI21.1 wherein R2 R3 and Rd are as previously defined and Ri is acyl R1 as previously defined or the group R NH is a protected amino group with an isocyanate having the formulaEMI21.2 or sequential segments thereof wherein R and R6 are as previously defined, and where Ri NH is a protected amino group removing said protecting group and acylating with the appropriate acylating group to form the desired product. The azetidinones of formula II can be prepared utilizing the procedures described inUnited Kingdom patent application 2,071,650, published September 23, 1981. The preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein R3 and R4 are each hydrogen.Also preferred are those compounds of formula I wherein R6 is a 5,6 or 7 membered heterocycle, especially a 4 alkyl 2,3 dioxo 1 piperazinyl group, a 2 oxoA imida zolid inyl group, a 3 alkyl 2 oxo 1 imidazolidinyl group or a 3 substituted alkyl 2 oxo 1 imidazolidinyl group. Specific groups that are preferred are the 4 ethyl 2,3 dioxo l piperazinyl, 3 ethyl 2oxo l imidazolidinyl, and 3 2 aminoethyl 2oxo l imidazolidinyl groups.Preferred 3 acylamino groups are those wherein the acyl portion of the group is Z 2 amino a alkoxy imino 4 thiazoleacetyl or Z 2 amino substituted alkyl oxy imino 4 thiazoleacetyl, especially Z 2 amino alpha methoxyimino 4 thiazoleacetyl and Z 2 amino a l carboxy l methylethoxy imino 4 thiazoleacetyl. The following examples are specific embodiments of this invention.
