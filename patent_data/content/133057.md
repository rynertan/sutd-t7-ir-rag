# Rear derailleur.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a rear derailleur A which includes a chain guide 8 comprising a guide pulley 81, a tension pulley 82, and at least one pulley plate 83 for rotatably supporting the pulleys, so that a drive chain C guided by the guide pulley 81 is switchable between the sprockets of a multistage sprocket assembly S for changing the cycle speed. The guide pulley 81 is supported so as to be axially movable with respect to the pulley plate 83, and between one lateral side of the guide pulley 81 and the inside surface of the pulley plate 83 is provided a gap K for allowing axial movement of the guide pulley 8 under the influence of the forces exerted thereon by the chain C, by means of the tension in the chain.
