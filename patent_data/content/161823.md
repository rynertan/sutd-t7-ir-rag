## Description
WAISTBANDS This invention relates to waistbands, and especially to fabric inserts which are used to stiffen waistbands, and waistbands including such stiffening inserts. We have for many years manufactured and sold a stiffening fabric known under the Trade Mark BAN ROL .This material is a woven fabric strip which is comparitively rigid in the narrow or weft direction but flexible in the warp direction, and is utilised to prevent rolling over of the edge of the garment at which the waistband incorporating the strip is located. The strip has transverse curvature which, combined with the rigid weft, exerts a force on the waistband fabric in a direction towards the wearer. Thus, roll over of the garment, for example trousers or a skirt, is resisted. The woven fabric of the stiffening strip suitably comprises a monofilament in the weft and usually a staple spun yam in the warp. The initially flat strip may be moulded under heat into the desired curved transverse cross section. The strip is suitably obtained by slitting it from a wide fabric or by weaving it to the required width on a narrow loom.The initial broad width fabric may be treated to bond the warp and weft, but the bonding material may become degraded during laundering and dry cleaning. In consequence the weft threads may work out at the edges of the strip, and can abrade and puncture the waistband fabric, with undesirable results. In order to overcome this problem it has been proposed, according to UnitedKingdom Patent Specification 1,213,957, to cover the edge of the stiffening strip, or both edges, with a continuous bead, for example of a polymeric plastics composition. It has been standard practice, both with the original product and with the product modified in accordance with U.K.Specification No 1,213,957, to finnish the stiffening strip by coating it with, or dipping it into, a solution of a suitable resinated or thermoplastics material. This finish serves to anchor the weft threads to the warp threads. There are problems associated with the use of such a finish , however, especially with the configuration of stitching used in modern fashions. For example, the plastics finish not only holds the weft to the warp, but also tends to fill the interstices between the threads. With modern jeans waistbands, it is usual to have three lines of stitching the needles may penetrate the interstices of the stiffening fabric, and if those interstices are in fact filled with polymeric finish , the result is rucking of the waistband. It is clearly desirable therefore to avoid the use of such a finish if at all possible, although it is equally important that the weft should be anchored to the warp, and remain vertical in use. It is an object of the present invention to supply a waistband stiffening strip which meets these requirements. According to the invention we provide a warp knit, weft inserted fabric wherein the weft is of monofilament thermoplastic material and is anchored to the warp by the loops formed in the warp. Such a knitted material is particularly suitable for use as a stiffening strip for waistbands, and has a much softer feel than the woven products used hitherto. In the fabrics of the invention, the warp may be of cotton but is preferably a multi filament polyester.The weft is preferably a polyamide monofilament weft of 300 1100 denier, most preferably of a denier at the lower end of that range. Suitably, there are between 30 and 36 picks of weft per inch. The fabric of the invention may if desired be treated with a finish as previously, but this is no longer such an essential component of the fabric, since the weft threads are mechanically held in the loops knitted into the warp. One or both edges of the stiffening strip of the invention may be provided with a continuous bead, to provide a smooth edge, in the manner described in U.K.Patent Specification 1,213,857. The knitted fabric of the invention may consist solely of wales knitted independently of each other, and separated only by the inserted weft, or it may contain additional or floating threads which traverse between the wales to form a fabric independent of the inserted weft. The addition of floating threads assists in the application of a plastisol smooth edge to the stiffening strip by providing extra anchorage. A stiffening fabric in accordance with the invention is illustrated schematically in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagram of a small portion of a stiffening strip, near to one edge Figure 2 is a rear view of one of the wales shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a diagram, similar to Figure 1, showing a modified fabric with floating threads. With reference to Figures 1 and 2, a stiffening strip is made from a warp knit weft inserted fabric 1 comprising a warp formed of threads 2, suitably of cotton or spun polyester, containing loops 3. A monofilament weft 4 suitably of 400 denier polyamide, is inserted into the loops 3 of the warp 2, and is anchored thereto by pulling the warp and thereby closing the loops 3. The ends 5 of the weft yarns 4 are retained in a continuous bead 6 of a plastisol material which may be applied in the manner described in U.K.Specification 1,213,957. The embodiment shown in Figure 3 is similar to that of Figures 1 and 2, but a floating thread 7 traverses between the wales 2 and forms a fabric therewith independent of the weft 4. The ends of the threads 7 are also retained in the plastisol bead 6. The stiffening strips are suitably formed by slitting from a wide fabric, and are particularly suitable for use in the stiffening of waistbands. One particular advantage of the strips is that they have a natural tendency to curve in one direction, thus completely obviating the need to mould transverse curvature into them, as was necessary with the prior art stiffening fabric described above.
