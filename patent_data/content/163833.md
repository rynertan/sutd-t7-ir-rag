# Improved laminated lock nut.

## Abstract
A laminated nut 60 composed of laminated conical spring segments retained in stacked aligned relationship by a surrounding cage so they act, in effect, as if they were a single threaded unit characterised by a top segment 70 having a predetermined axial load and a bottom segment 72 having a different predetermined deflection when sub jected to the same axial load, the deflection of said top section by a predetermined amount sufficient to more even ly distribute a load transmitted across said thread from bolt to said nut along the entire segments.
