## Description
BACKGROUND OF ERE INVENTION This invention relates to mechanism for securely retaining sockets or other tool attachments on, and easily releasing them from, socket wrenches and other torque transmitting tools, and is particularly adapted for use with extension bars of the type now commonly used with wrenches.The mechanism of this invention can generally be used on all hand held tools, including power and impact tools having removable sockets or other tool attachments and in particular can be usec with hand held socket wrenches including ratchet wrenches Thereas this invention may be employed with various types of wrenches or other torque tools, it is especially adapted for use on wrenches and tools that have drive studs at least slightly longer than the drive studs conventionally employed on ratchet wrenches.Accordingly this invention is well suited for use on extension bars of the type now freauently employed to transmit torquf to attachments for socket wrenches for reaching work located in remote or otherwise unaccessible places, thus making the socket wrench a more versatile tool. Socket wrenches of the type referred to herein have a handle, a head or other torque transmitting portion, and a square, hexagonal or like drive stud for receiving removable sockets or other tool attachments. For many years prior to the invention of a quick release mechanism for socket wrenches, ffirst disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,208,318, Roberts , removable sockets were usually secured to the wrench by a conventional ball detent device which in use necessitated that the sockets be manually pushed onto and pulled off of the drive stud of the wrench against the resistance of the ball detent. In the conventional ball detent design, the ball detent is spring mounted in an aperture in the drive stud with the normal position of the ball detent being in an outward position, that is, with the ball projecting outward of the surface of the drive stud.When the socket is mounted on the drive stud, the spring loaded detent protrudes from the exterior surface of the drive stud to engage a recess in the socket and thereby hold the socket onto the drive stud To remove the socket from this conventional ball detent design stud, the user normally grasps the socket with his hand and exerts a pulling force on it, thereby forcing the spring loaded ball detent to recede into the aperture so that the socket can be pulled or pried off and released from the drive stud. This conventional manner of securing and releasing sockets, however, resulted in a great many practical difficulties. One of these problems was that the re.l.oval of the socket required the use of both of the user s hands one hand to hold the handle of the wrench and the other hand to pull the socket off the drive stud. Removal of the socket in this manner became a particularly time consuming and labor wasting task, especially when the socket or the user s hands became greasy and it consequently became difficult for the user to grasp and hold the socket while pulling on it.This problem was exacerbated by the spring necessarily present in a new wrench which had to be quite stiff if the spring was constructed to exert a force sufficient to retain a socket or other attachment through the expected life of the wrench. Moreover, removal of this socket proved difficult or impossible if the conventional ball detent spring mechanism jammed, as it sometimes did when it became contaminated with dirt or grease, both of which are, of course, ordinarily present in the working places of mechanics who frequently use such tools. The consequence of such contamination was that a great deal of force was ordinarily revuired to remove the socket. As a maReshift remedy for these problems, users frequently removed the socket from the wrench by prying it off with a screwdriver or other levering device. Indeed, the problem became so acute that some manufacturers offered special tools to pry off sockets.This time consuming procedure of removing sockets from wrenches became particularly troublesome for commercial mechanics, who frequently use such wrenches for many hours during the day and change sockets many times during that period. As indicated above, the first and only fully effective solution to this problem was provided by the quick release mechanism disclosed in the aboveidentified Roberts patent As shown in that patent Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4 , a longitudinal passage in the drive stud receives a slidable pin, one end extending through the top of the head of the wrench and terminating in a control knob and the other end substantially flush during normal operation with the bottom face of the drive stud.The drive stud has an aperture for receiving a ball detent, the edges of the aperture preventing the ball detent from passing outside the stud. A coil spring mounted in a section of said longitudinal passage maintains the pin normally in a position to keep the ball detent in an outward position, the ball detent thereby normally engaging and securely holding the socket. The slidable elongate pin is provided with a recess, so that when the operating button is depressed, the pin moves longitudinally in the passage until the detent is received in the recess.At that point, the socket is no longer secured to tile drive stud and can be permitted to drop off through the force of gravity. The above described invention proved to be a remarkable success that was cuickly adopted in most conventional socket wrenches and virtually revolutionalized the socket wrench field. It enabled for the first time users of socket wrenches to easily and swirftly Remove sockets from socket wrenches and replace sockets on the drive stud with little effort, and while using only one hand. One handed operations were a decided time and cost advantage when, for example a mechanic needed one hand to change a socket while holding a part he was working on in place with the other hand. Today, a large percentage of all socket wrenches in use are provided with some mechanism to facilitate the release of sockets from wrenches. Roberts quick release mechanism, however, did not provide for positive locking of the socket onto the dA e stud to prevent accidental release of the socket nis added feature would be highly useful on powe 2 impact tools and also on socket wrenches when, for e a.. Ole, work is being done on bridges or high buildings cr the like where the accidental loss of a socket by unintended release not only produces the serious problems of replacing the lost socket but also the likelihood of damage to valuable or delicate machinery or property below and even danger to life. There are numerous other circumstances where a positive locking mechanism would be highly desirable.For example, in using socket wrenches in repetitive tasks requiring prolonged use of the same tool attachment, a positively locking mechanism is highly desirable. In another circumstance, it is sometimes necessary to employ what is referred to as an extension bar to facilitate the removal of bolts that would otherwise not be accessible to a mechanic. An extension bar is ordinarily secured to the drive stud of the wrench, as is any regular socket and at its other end it is provided with a similar drive stud for receiving a socket Prior to the present invention the sockets were retained on and released from the extension bar drive stud by a conventional ball detent mechanism of the kind described above. With such detent mechanism a user removed a sccket from the extension bar, by simply pulling it off. But in doing so, it was imperative that he not also remove the extension bar from the wrench drive stud, which would often happen with a conventionally designed ball detent mechanism as to do so would be frustrating and time consuming, requiring a three hand operation. The incorporation of a locking mechanism onto the socket wrench to securely lock the extension bar onto the drive stud alleviates this problem.Mechanism for accomplishing such locking of extension bars as well as sockets and other tool attachments is now the subject of this inventors copending application for Patent Serial No. 270,733 filed June 5, 1981 Extension bars of the type here referred to are employed when it is necessary to project the socket into an inaccessible area but which can accommodate the extension bar and socket. Such situations are encountered frequently when working on various types of machines that have nuts, bolts or other work pieces closely surrounded by other machine parts or other objects which allow only limited working space such as will accommodate only an extension bar and socket.In such cases an extension bar of suitable length is required which has at its upper end a suitable recess adapted to be attached in driving relation to and be retained on the drive stud of a wrench and at its lower end a drive stud for receiving a socket or other tool a ttachment There is a need therefore, in the field of tools employing extension bars of the type here con templated, to provide mechanism which is inexpensive, reliable and easily constructed by which sockets and other tool attachments may easily applied to, firmly retained on and quickly released from the drive stud portion of the extension bars and by which the sockets and other tool attachments may be positively locked in operative association to effectively preclude the possibility of accidental release Whereas the invention here disclosed is of such construction that it is particularly well suited for use with extension bars, it is not to be so limited as the s me construction can be used with the same functional advantages on wrenches of various sorts which employ sockets or other tool attac t mnts, including for example ratchet wrenches, speeder wrenches, and T bar wrenches example of which are disclosed herein as well as other types of tools which are capable of embodying the structural features which characterize this invention OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a mechanism for easily attaching sockets or other tool attachments to wrenches and for firmly retaining them in their attached working relationship thereon against unwanted or accidental release therefrom while at the same time permitting a quick and easy release of such sockets and attachments at the will of the operator. It is a further and particular object of this invention to provide a mechanism of the type above referred to which is so constructed and designed as to be readily applied to the drive stud portion of extension bars of the type frequently employed with such wrenches. It is a further object of this invention to provide a mechanism for attaching sockets or tool tach ments to wrenches or extension bars for wrenches by the simple operation of placing the drive stud portion thereof into the stud receiving opening in the socket or other attachment and moving the drive stud portion into final attaching position and which by such simple movement serves to lock the socket or other attachment in place and retain the same against removal by a pulling force such as would remove the same when held by the customary ball detent devices. In other words an attaching mechanism which automatically achieves a positive locking of the socket or other attachment on the drive stud by the simple movement of attaching the two parts in the conventional manner. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in this art upon considering of the following description when read in the light of the accompanying drawings. The present invention will be described as it is used on a usual hand held ratchet socket wrench having a handle, a head, a usually square or hexagonal drive stud and an extension bar attached thereto which also has a drive stud portion at its lower end for receiving sockets or other tool attachments. This invention in one of its forms is characterized as having a diagonally disposed bore or opening extending through the drive stud of the wrench or the extension bar, or other tool as the case may be, from one side to the opposite side and having a spring operated downwardly urged pin slidably mounted therein which is of sufficient length to simultaneously project beyond both sides of the drive stud, said bore and pin being so disposed angularly that when a socket or other attachment is in place on the drive stud the upper end of the pin projects outwardly beyond the outer surface of the drive stud at a point above the upper end of the socket or attachment and the lower end of the pin projects beyond the surface of the drive stud at a point within the drive stud receiving recess of the soc or attachment and in such position that it will extend into the conventional ball receiving recess now formed in properly manufactured sockets and attachmentsFurthermore, the angle of the bore and pin is such that wnen the socket or attachment is pushed onto the drive stud of the wrench or extension bar and the upper edge of the socket or attachment exerts a czzzing force on the ulcer surface of the end cf the pin that force is sufficient to move the pin axially upwardly in the bore. Such movement permits the top of the socket or atXac menç to pass beyond the pin and permit the socket or attachment to enter into attaching relationship with the stud. In addition the upper side of the inner end of the pin is so formed as to prevent any carving action between the inner surrace of the socket and the pin such as could, in view of the selected angle of the bore and pin, generate an upward force in the direction of the pin axis such as would cause the pin to accidentally or unintentionally release the socket or attachment.Therefore, once in place the socket is firmly and positively locked on the stud until the operator deliberately moves the pin outwardly to release it. In fact any downward force on the socket causes the inner surface of the socket to press against the contacting portion of the pin which in turn pushes the pin more firmly into contact with the underlying surface of the bore, thereby more firmly locking the socket or attachment to the drive stud. In the forms of this invention which employ a spring actuated pin, a suitable means is provided for preventing rotation of the pin in the bore in order that tile location of the particular construction features above described for controlling the cawing and locking actions is maintained In another form of the invention which employs the same diagonally disposed bore and pin construction functions without a spring and depends upon rotation of the pin to present two different sides of the pin inner end, one of which allows the free movement of the socket on and off of the stud while the other locks the socket against release once placed on the stud. This form has additional means for locking the pin in either selected position. Yet another form of this invention employs a lever pivoted in the diagonal opening in the drive stud of the wrench or extension bar which is spring pressed into a position presenting the inner end of the lever in locking engagement with the socket but which can be manually moved to permit a quick release of the socket.

FIGURE 17 is an elevational view of another manually operated wrench sometimes referred to as a nT bar type of wrench and here shown as provided with a drive stud constructed in accordance with this invention and FIGURE 18 is a view similar to FIGURE 17 showing another forn of T bar wrench having a much shorter drive stud portion and also having its drive stud constructed in accordance with this invention FIGURE 19 is an elevational fragmentary view partly in cross section showing the type of socket attaching and releasing mechanism illustrated inFIGURES 1 to 5 inclusive, applied to a ratchet type of socket wrench instead of to extension bars for such wrenchesDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The preferred form of this invention is illustrated in FIGURES 1 to 5 inclusive of the accompanying drawings, and as there shown is embodied in an extension bar 10 having at its upper end a square opening 12 adapted to receive a drive stud 14 of a wrench designated generally as 16 and having a head 17 and a manually operable handle 18.The extension bar can be of any desired length and in practice it is contemplated that a plurality of different length bars will be available to a user of the wrench in order that 2 bar of the desired length may be selected for use at any particular time, and also in order that a short extension bar may be kept on a conventional or locking wrench at all times, for convenience, versatiiity and ease of operation except when a low profile tool is required for the job. The extension bar 10 is provided at its lower end with a drive stud portion 20 which in this instance is square but which may be of any other desired non round shape and is adapted to fit into and have driving relation with a socket 22 or other similar attaczrnent. The socket 22 is conventional in its construc tion and is provided with a drive stud receiving central opening 23 having on its inside surfaces recesses 24 preferably one on each inner face of the square or other non round opening in the socket each of which serves in use with conventional tools, to accommooate a ball of a spring pressed ball detent but which here serves to accommodate the holding and locking means of this invention As shown in the drawings the lower portion of the extension bar is provided with a diagonally disposed bore or opening 26 which is of a size to slidably receive a pin 30 therein. The pin 30 is of sufficient length to extend beyond the surface of the extension bar at its upper end when its lower end is extended into the recess 24 of the socket as shown in FIGuRES 3 and 4. At its upper end the pin 30 has a transverse hole 32 extending therethrough which receives the lower end of a coiled spring 34 which spirals around the above adjacent portion of the extension bar for a plurality of turns and is anchored at its upper end in an opening 36 in the extension bar It is preferred to have the lower two coils of the spring 34 pass through the hole 32 in the pin 30. The coiled spring 3r is an expansion spring that is to say, it is biased to exert a downward pressure on the upper end of the pin 30. The spring in this embodiment serves an array of functions, including providing an axial stop for the pin, a rotational stop for the pin, a handle for releasing sockets by withdrawing the pin from the socket, a source of force for initially locking and retaning the socket on the tool and a means for automatically adjusting for wear on the pin.In addition, the use of the spring in this embodiment insures the lowest overall circur .feren tial and rotational profile for the extension bar or other tool on which this invention is employed The lower end of the pin is provided on its under side with a rounded cam surface 38 which is adapted to contact the upper edg 40 of the socket opening 23 when the extension bar is moved downwardly into the opening 23 as shown in FIGURE 1 and to serve to force the pin 10 upwardly and inwardly upon further continued movement of the extension bar 10 into the position represented by the illustration in FIGURE 2. Thus when the desired socket is supported on a surface such as 2 as shown in FIGURES 1, 2 and 3 with its drive stud receiving opening 23 facing upwardly the operator may introduce the lower end of the extension bar which may or may not be attached in driving relation to a wrench into the upper end of opening 23 of the socket and by the simple maneuver of moving it downwardly the pin is caused to move upwardly by the canming engagement between its lower end surface 38 and the upper edge of the socket 40, whereby the extension bar is free to continue its downward movement until it has reached its final position as illustrated in FIGURE 3. In this final position the socket is positively locked on the drive stud of the extension bar and it cannot be accidentally released nor can it be removed by being grasped and pulled from the end of the extension bar in the manner being attempted in FIGURE 4. Rather z release can be effected only by the operator gripping the lower loop of the spring wire coil in the manner illustrated in FIGURE 5 and lifting the spring 34 and the pin 30 as indicated by an arrow. The locking action results from the fact that the angle of the diagonal bore 26 is such that the effort exerted on the end of the pin 30 by the inside surface of the recess 24 in the socket 22 cannot generate a component of force in the direction of the axis of the pin 30 such as would cause the pin to move upwardly axially. Rather the force so exerted tends to move the end of the pin 30 downwardly into tighter frictional engagement in the underside of the bore 26. In order to provide the least possible camming tendency reteen the pin 30 and the recess surace 2 of the socket 22 the upper surface of the pin 30 is shaped to form a step A4 which further assures the locking above described. In the construction shown the pin 30 is round in cross section as is the bore 26 which receives it and in this case the rotation of the pin 30 in the bore 26 is prevented by the attachment of the pin 30 to the end of the spring 34. It will be understood, however, that the pin could be square or other non round shape and in this manner be held against rotation. Avoiding rotation of the pin 30 in the form illustrated is m portant in order to maintain the positions of the upper and lower sides of the end of the pin 30 so as to assure the intended camming action when affixing a socket on the drive stud of the extension bar and the locked status of the socket when once so affixed. When this invention is applied to extension bars the upper end of such bars 12 are constructed with a central opening 46 which may be square as shown or of other non round shape and are adapted to fit in and be driven by the drive stud 14 of a wrench indicated gener ally at 16.In addition, the inside flat surfaces of the opening 46 preferable are each provided with a recess 48 which, when used with conventional wrenches, are adapted to receive a ball of a spring pressed ball detent now commonly used for attaching drive studs of wrenches to sockets Inasmuch as the extension bar of this invention is intended to be interchangeable with such sockets, when used with such wrenches, the upper end of the extension bar of this invention, which attaches to the drive stud of a wrench1 s in all respects similar to Lne corresponding parts of conventional sockets It is to be noted that the wrench here illustrated in FIGURE I or use wit the described extension bar is not of convet onal construction but rather is constructed in accordance with a plicant s invention described and claimed in opening Application SerialNo. 270,733 filed June 5, 1981 As there set forth the wrench quickly releases sockets in the manner disclosed in applicant s UnitedStates Letters Patent No. 3,208,318 issued on September 28 1965, and in addition provides a positive locking capability which eliminates all accidental or unintended release of sockets, extension bars or other attachments from the drive studs or wrenches. As shown in FIGURE l the drive stud 14 of the wrench has an axial opening 52 extending therethrcucjh which is of larger diameter at its top portion to provide a step 54 therein. Located in the opening 52 is a slidable and rotatable pin 56 having recessed portions in its lower cylindrical surface which result in the particular contour represented in the drawing and illustrated fully and described in applicant s copending application above referred to.In said application it is made clear that one recessed portion serves to hold the ball 50 in socket attaching engagement when the pin is in upper springpressed position and to release the ball when the pin is manually pressed downwardly, and that another recessed portion also cooperates with ball 50 when the pin is rotated through a predetermined angle and thus serves to hold the ball in locking contact with the socket.When the pin so locks the ball, the pin is in turn locked against downward movement by the ball. The upper portion of the pin 56 is surrounded by a coil spring 58 which has its lower end seated on the step 5t and its up per end pressing against the under surface of collar 60 preferably formed as a part of the pin 50. The spring 58 is an expansion spring and presses the collar 60 upwardly to normally maintain the pin in raised position with the collar 60 pressing against retaining plate 62 which maintains the parts in assembled relation. The pin 50 further has a control knob 64 extending upwardly through the plate 62 in position to be manually depressed when the pin is in one rotary position and which can be readily rotated a predetermined amount to effect a locking and unlocking of the quick release mechanism. The wrench illustrated is a ratchet type wrench having a conventional control lever 66 2s shown, but could be any other type of wrench. However when the wrench and extension bar shown in FIGURE 1 are employed together it will be noted that both the extension bar and the socket are attached to their associated driving stud parts by mechanisms which can be locked against accidental or unintended socket release and also can be readily unlocked and easily operated for quick release by the simple one handed maneuver.Also the combination allows either attached part to be released and not the other, that is to say the socket may be released from the extension bar without releasing the extension bar from the driving stud of the wrench ana vice verso It should further be noted that th locking and unlocking of the wrench release mechanism effected by rotating the control knob 64 as well as depressing the same can both be readily accomplished by one hand maneuvers Furthermore whether the invention here claimed is applied to the drive stud of a wrench or to the drive stud portion of an extension bar the unlocking and releasing can be effected by a simple onehanded maneuver which requires only that two fingers be extended downwardly on opposite sides of the spring 34 an the spring 34 and pin 30 lifted while holding the wrench, with or without an extension bars in the palm of the same hand. A somewhat modified form of the invention is illustrated in FIGURES 6 and 7. Here the diagonally disposed and slidably mounted pin with its associated coil spring are the same as those above described, but in addition a protective sleeve 70 is provided to cover the spring 34 and the upper end of the pin 30. Preferably the protective sleeve is provided with an outward ly extended portion 72 to create space nside the sleeve to accommLodate the upward and outward movement of the end of the pin.Also the upper and louver ends of the sleeve are preferably extended inwardly to form flanges, 2S shown, at 74 and 76 respectively to netter enclose the space and guide the movement of the sleeve. When the sleeve 70 is employed the bottom flange 76 constitutes a form of collar which provides a more positive means to be engaged for upward movement by the fingers of the operator. In order to prevent the sleeve from rotating and to better guide it in an axial path a tongue 78 may be provided for movement in a groove 80 formed in the extension bar 10. Another modified form of this invention is illustrated in FIGURES 8 and 9 of the drawings. Like the first described form this form is shown as applied to an extension bar for a wrench As here shown the extension bar 90 has a drive stud portion 92 at its lower end which may be square or other non round shape for drivIng attachment to a socket or other tool not shown and also has G bore 9 extending diagonally therethrough fre a position above the socket engaging area to a location within the socket engaging area of the extension bar. The bore is preferably enlarged at its urged portion to provide a step 95 therein. Within the bore a pin 96 is slidably mounted.The pin has a circu erential flange 92 ford intermediate its length which serves as a seat for the lower end of a coil eZp2nsicn spring 98 which is biased to urge the pin in a downward direction. The upper end of the spring is retained in the upper portion of the bore 9 by a sleeve 99 which in this case surrounds a portion of the extension bar and encloses the space which accommodates the pin 96. The spring 98 is retained therein in compressedcondition. The pin slidably projects therebeyond by extending through opening 93 provided in the sleeve 99 at the location of the bor eis. The pin 96 has on its outer end a control knob 97 which enables it to be rasped by the operator and pulled outwardly and upwardly against the action of the spring 98 a distance sufficient to bring the lower end of the pin inside the contour of the drive stud portion of the extension bar. The lower end of pin 96 is formed the same as that of the pin 3 disclosed inFIGURE. 1 and its locking and releasing action is in all respects the same as previously described. In FIGURE 9 the device of FIGE 8 is shown with the pin in lifted position so that its lower end is in position to release a socket. It is to be understood that a socket may be attached by lifting the pin as illustrated in FIGURE, 9 and then inserting the drive stud portion of the extension bar into the socket and then permitting the spring 98 to return the pin to its lowennost position to thereby attach and lock the socket.On the other hand the drive stud portion may be inserted into the socket without lifting the pin, in which case, when the under cam surface of the pin engages the upper edge of the socket opening, in the manner shown in FIGURE. 1 an upward movement of the pin is effected without manually lifting the same Referring now to FIGURES 10 and fl a still further modification of tis invention is shown. Here the construction is in most respects like that shown inFIGURES 8 and 9, however a different type of spring is employed. The pin 100 is slidably mounted in a bore 102 of uniform dIameter throughout its length, and the pin has a spring receiving opening 105 provided therein. In addition a complementary spring receiving opening 106 is provided in the extension bar disposed in the manner illustrated. These openings together provide a chamber for housing an extension spring 108 which is attached at one end to the extension bar by holding means 107 and at its other end to the pin 104 by hold ing means 109. This form of the invention functions in all respects like that of the form of FiGURES 8 and 9 except that an extension spring instead of a compression spring is employed. In the form of this invention illustrated inFIGURES 12, 13 and 14 a rotary pin is employed. In this form no spring is required. By referring to the drawings it will be noted that a diagonally disposed bore 110 is provided in the drive stud to accommodate a rotatable pin 112. All axial movement of the pin is prevented by a screw or like means 113 extending through the drive stud and fitting tangentially in the peripheral groove 114 with clearance sufficient to permit the pin to freely rotate. The lower end of the pin 112 is formed with a diagonally disposed surface 111 which provides in one position of the pin 112 a nose like portion which projects beyond the contour of the drive stud and cooperates with the adjacent recess in the associated socket and thus serve to affix the socket on the end of the extension bar. See for instance FIGURE 13 However in the position of the pin resulting from a 1800 rotation thereof the nose like projection referred to is moved into the confines of the contour of the drive stud whereby an attached socket or other tool is at once free to fall by gravity from the drive stud. See for instance FIGURE 14. In addition the outer end of the pin 12 is provided with a handle 115 which is pivotally attached as by means of a hinge 116 clearly shown in the drawings. The handle preferably has a locking means which here comprises a hole 117 formed through the handle and a latching device of the type illustrated consisting of spring fingers 118 and a holding bolt 119 therefor mounted in the side of the extension bar in position to be received in the hole 117. By comparing the showings in FIGURES 13 and 14 it will be seen that the pin 112 can be locked in either position, that is in socket holding position or in socket releasing position merely by freeing the handle as shown in FIGURE 12 and rotating the pin 112 as represented by the arrow. When in the desired position the handle may be moved on its hinge 116 to cause the hole 117 to overlie the latching springs 118 and there after locking engagement therebetween can be effected. In the iorm of the invention illustrated inFIGURE 15 the extension bar 120 having a driving stud at its lower end is provided with a diagonally disposed slot 122 in which is mounted a lever 124 pivoted at 126 as shown. The lever 124 is urged by a compression spring 128 to normally occupy the position shown in full lines in FIGURE 15. The spring 128 is seated at one end in the opening 130 in the lever and at its other end on the opposed surface of the slot 122. The upper end of the lever extends beyond the side surface of the extension bar as at 132 and may have serations 135 on its upper edge so as to be readily engaged by the thumb or finger of the operator for downward unlatching movement against the resistance of the spring When in socket attaching position that is in the position illustrated in full lines in FIGURE 15 the lever has a portion 136 which extends beyond the surface of the drive stud into locking engagement with the recess normally found in sockets or like attachments. The lever effectively locks the socket in place on the extension bar because a downward force exerted on the socket will only serve to urge the lever in a clockwise direction as shown in FIGURE 15, and thus against the upper surface of the slot. Accordingly to release the socket a positive and intended movement of the upper end of the lever must be made as a deliberate act by the operator. It is to be understood that in addition to its application to socket wrenches as shown in FIGURE 1 this invention may be applied to other forms of wrenches such for instance as those illustrated in FIGURES 16, 17 and 18, respectively. In FIGURE 16 there is illustrated a so called speeder wrench 140 which has a crank portion 142 for convenient manual operation and at its lower end quick release socket attaching mechanism 1z4 like that illustrated in FIGURE 1. The same type of socket attaching mechanism is illustrated in FIGURE 17 except that in this case the mechanism of this invention is shown as applied to the lower end of a so called T bar wrench having an operating shaft 150 and a handle 152. In FIGURE 18 there is shown another form of T bar wrench comprising essentially a driving stud 160, a head 162 and a handle 16t along which the head may slide. In this form the socket attaching mechanism is that shown in either FIG u RES 8 and 9 or in FIGURES 10 and 11. EIGURE 19 shows this invention applied to a ratchet type socket wrench instead of to an extension bar. In this form the head 170 and handle 172 therefor may be of any conventional construction but the drive portion 174 thereof may be slightly longer than customary.At its lower end a drive stud 176 for receiving a socket or similar attachment 178 is provided. This form or the invention permits the sockets to be picked up and retained on the drive stud by a positive locking action and to be quickly released by lifting the lower turn of the spring 180 and pin 182 as previously described with respect to the device of FIGURE 1. It is also important that this operation can be carried out while holding the wrench in one hand. It will be apparent that the socket attaching mechanism illustrated in FIGURES 8 through 15 inclusive can also be applied to a socket wrench head and handle of the type illustrated in FIGURE 19. Whereas this invention is applicable for use with wrenches as well as extension bars the term drive stud is intended to refer not only to the square or non round end of the drive member but also to that portion of the drive member above the square or non round end and accordingly the term drive stud is to be given this broader meaning in the appended claims except where more limited meaning is clearly indicated from the text as a whole. It is spparent that any of the types of wrenches illustrated may be employed with any of the illustrated forms of socket latching mechanisms and that the extension bar constructions shown and described could each be used on wrenches constructed like that disclosed in FIGURE 19. Further it should be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the illustrated forns but shall include m11 other forms that fairly fall within the scope of the appended claims.
