## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, and is concerned for example with the disposition of peripheral circuit blocks in a semiconductor memory having a high density memory matrix, and more particularly for instance with the layout of sense amplifiers connected to bit lines of the memory. Since memory cell size can be reduced to as little as approximately 1 µm x 1 µm, which is considered to be the limit of current manufacturing accuracy, in a high density memory, particularly in a dynamic RAM Random Access Memory , a large scale integrated memory device with a bit line width of 1 µm and an inter line interval of 1 µm can be produced. However, a peripheral circuit block, for example providing address decoders to be connected to word lines or providing sense amplifiers to be connected to bit lines, cannot be accommodated within that minimum size of 1 µm x 1 µm because such a peripheral circuit block includes a large number of elements. Currently, a sense amplifier is about 30 µm in width and bit line width is several microns. Therefore, when a memory matrix is integrated with particularly high density as explained above, it is geometrically impossible to arrange peripheral circuits, such as sense amplifiers, in a line crossing the productions of respective bit lines serving the memory cells of such a memory matrix. That is, considering a plurality of parallel bit lines extending from a memory matrix it is impossible to arrange sufficient sense amplifiers to serve all the bit lines in a row or line perpendicular to the bit lines within the space between first and last bit lines. An attempt to provide such an arrangement will bring about a result in which portions of bit lines extending from the memory matrix and connected to the sense amplifiers spread out in the form of a fan and an area between the row of sense amplifiers and the memory matrix will be taken up in a non useful fashion due to the expansion or fanning out of the bit lines. Moreover, the lengths of the portions of the bit lines which extend to sense amplifiers differ in accordance with the positions of the cells which the bit lines serve, and particularly in the case of a dynamic RAM comprising memory cells each of which is composed of one transistor and one capacitor, the capacities of bit lines, undesirably, become different. US A 4 099 162 discloses an arrangement in which two output amplifiers are arranged one partly behind and beyond the other in relation to a decoder circuit for two decoder lines which are respectively connected to the amplifiers. The width of an output amplifier can thus exceed the decoder grid size. Connecting wiring to the output amplifier further from the decoder circuit passes around the side of the nearer output amplifier. According to the present invention there is provided a semiconductor memory device having a memory matrix area in which memory cells are provided at intersections of row and column wiring lines or wiring line pairs, and a plurality of peripheral circuits connected to row or column wiring lines or line pairs, characterised in that the peripheral circuits connected to a predetermined number of adjacent ones of said wiring lines or line pairs are arranged one after another when considered in a first direction, parallel to said wiring lines or line pairs, in such a manner that the peripheral circuits of the plurality are arranged in ranks when considered in a second direction transverse to the first direction, each peripheral circuit of the plurality having a width, in the second direction, corresponding to the distance between the first and last of n adjacent ones of said lines or line pairs, n peripheral circuits being arranged one after another, when considered in the first direction, on one side of the memory matrix area and connected directly to respective wiring lines or line pairs extending from the matrix memory area, with a first line or line pair being connected to a first of the n peripheral circuits, nearest the memory matrix area, a second line or line pair being connected to a second of the n peripheral circuits, next nearest the memory matrix area, the second line or line pair passing over the first of the n peripheral circuits, and so on. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory system in which high integration density is realised by facilitating the connections between X and Y direction wirings of a highly integrated memory matrix and peripheral circuits of peripheral circuit blocks. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory system in which the problem relating to layout which results from a large difference between the density of wirings in X and Y directions of a highly integrated memory matrix and the density of peripheral circuits in peripheral circuit blocks connected to the respective wirings is solved, and in which high integration density is provided through effective use of area. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory system in which high integration density is realised by facilitating connections between bit lines of a highly integrated memory matrix and sense amplifiers which are formed with a density different from that of the bit lines. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory system in which area is used effectively as a result of facilitation of connections between word lines and or bit lines of a highly integrated memory matrix and decoder circuits for selecting between such lines An embodiment of the present invention can provide a highly integrated dynamic random access memory in which the difficulty in making connections between bit lines of a memory matrix in which memory cells each comprise one transistor and one capacitor are arranged in the form of a matrix with high density, and sense amplifiers connected to the bit lines, which difficulty results from a large difference in size between bit lines and sense amplifiers is overcome, and ineffective use of the area for connections is eliminated. An embodiment of the present invention can be provided in which memory matrix area having a large number of wirings or wiring pairs crossing in row and column directions and having memory cells arranged at intersections, has the following characteristics a plurality of peripheral circuit blocks which are to be connected to a predetermined number of adjacent wirings or wiring pairs are sequentially arranged one block after another in the same direction as the wirings or wiring pairs to which they are to be connected in such a manner that at least some of the peripheral circuit blocks are arranged in files or ranks and wirings or wiring pairs extended from the memory matrix region are connected to the peripheral circuit blocks. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Recent semiconductor memory systems are more advanced in the achievement of high integration density for memory cell matrixes because memory cells provided at the intersections of word lines which extend in a row direction, and bit lines which extend in a column direction have been reduced in size by a variety of methods. Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating a conventional semiconductor memory system in particular Figure 1 outlines the overall structure of a dynamic RAM comprising memory cells each of which is composed of one transistor and one capacitor. SUP is a power supply circuit which receives a variety of power source voltages V D In order to increase memory capacity, the memory cell matrix is improved to offer higher integration density by further reducing memory cell size. The dimensions of the bit line pairs and the sense amplifiers are not equal, and as indicated in Figure 1, sense amplifiers arranged in a line cannot be accommodated within the lateral extent of the memory cell matrix area as seen in the Figure. Therefore, the portions of the bit lines which extend for connection with the sense amplifiers spread out in the form of a fan, resulting in inefficient use of area. This contradicts the purpose of realisation of high integration density. One way to avoid this problem is to provide multiplexer switching circuits and to use the same sense amplifier in common for the plurality of bit line pairs, as described in IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC 15, No. 2 April 1980, page 184 189. However, it is a defect that the extra circuits, such as multiplexer switching circuits and timing clock signals for switching, are needed and a refresh time for memory cells is longer. Figure 2 is a block diagram indicating the overall structure of a semiconductor memory system embodying the present invention. Parts similar to those in the memory of Figure 1 are given the same reference symbols. In a conventional memory system, sense amplifiers connected to respective bit line pairs are arranged in a line adjacent to the memory matrix area. In the embodiment of Figure 2, however, the sense amplifiers are arranged in two or more lines or files adjacent to a memory matrix area, thereby avoiding the need for extended bit line portions which spread out into the form of a fan. Namely, in the present embodiment, sense amplifiers SAn, SAn 1 connected to adjacent bit line pairs Bn, Bn and Bn 1, Bn 1 or Bm, Bm and Bm 1, Bm 1 are arranged in respective files the direction of which crosses the direction of the bit lines. Thereby, the sense amplifiers SAn, SAn 1 can be arranged so as to lie within in the same width as the width of the two bit line pairs i.e. the lateral extent of the two sense amplifiers, as seen in Figure 2, is substantially equal to the lateral spacing taken up by the two bit line pairs , making it possible to provide a memory matrix layout with high integration density and facilitating arrangement of the sense amplifiers even if the bit line width is reduced. Moreover, if integration density of the memory matrix is further increased, connections between sense amplifiers and bit line pairs can still be effected easily by arranging the sense amplifiers in three files or more. Thus, as seen along the direction of bit line pairs, two or more sense amplifiers overlap or are in register behind one another. Figure 3 shows an enlarged schematic diagram of a part of Figure 2. B₁, B₁ B₂, B₂ and B₃, B₃ are bit line pairs, and memory cells consisting of respective transistors QC₁, QC₂ and QC₃, and respective capacitors C₁, C₂ and C₃ are provided at the intersections between the bit line pairs and word lines WD. In addition, at intersections between the bit line pairs and dummy word lines DWD, DWD , dummy cells consisting respectively of transistors QD₁, QD₁ QD₂, QD₂ QD₃, QD₃ and capacitors CD₁, CD₁ CD₂, CD₂ CD₃, CD₃ and discharging transistors QDP₁, QDP₁ QDP₂ The sense amplifiers SA1, SA2 and SA3 are respectively composed of transistors Q₁₁, Q₁₂, Q₁₃, Q₁₄, Q₁₅, Q₁₆, Q₁₇ Q₂₁, Q₂₂, Q₂₃, Q₂₄, Q₂₅, Q₂₆, Q₂₇ and Q₃₁, Q₃₂, Q₃₃, Q₃₄, Q₃₅, Q₃₆, Q₃₇ as indicated in the Figure. V The structure of the present embodiment employs a multi layer wiring system, and provides an advantage in that all sense amplifiers are arranged on one side of a memory cell matrix area as in the case of the conventional memory system, and particular modification of the structure or layout of other peripheral circuits and the portions of the bit lines which extend for connection to sense amplifiers is not required. The embodiment described above is adapted to a memory system of the folded bit line type, where bit line pairs are provided in parallel the lines of the pair run alongside one another . Figure 4 is a block diagram of the overall structure of another embodiment of the present invention obtained by adapting the present invention to a case in which bit line pairs Bn, Bn Bn 1, Bn 1 are spread to both sides i.e. extend to opposite sides of a sense amplifier . In a dynamic RAM of this type, in which each memory cell consists of one transistor and one capacitor, the content of a memory cell connected to a bit line Bn is, for example, read on the basis of a comparison with the content of a dummy memory cell connected to a pairing bit line Bn . A dynamic RAM of this type, is larger than the folded bit line type in terms of line length and the the dimensions of inter bit lines and the degree of unbalance between the width of sense amplifiers and line width. Therefore, a notable effect can be obtained by adapting the present invention to such a type of dynamic RAM. In the present embodiment, the sense amplifiers SA1, SA2 are arranged in two ranks or files and the bit line pair. Bn, Bn is connected to the sense amplifier SA1, while the bit line pairs Bn 1, Bn 1 is connected to the sense amplifier SA2. In the above embodiments, the present invention has been explained on the basis of its application to the relationship between bit line pairs and sense amplifiers. The present invention can naturally be adapted for application to the relationship between word lines or word line pairs, or bit lines or bit line pairs and decoder circuits, such as row or column decoders and between word lines or word line pairs or bit lines or bit line pairs and any other peripheral circuits, such as word decoder circuits for selecting and driving word lines or word line pairs, connected thereto. As explained above, the present invention has the advantage that the word lines or bit lines of a highly integrated memory matrix and peripheral circuits in a peripheral circuit block such as an address decoder, sense amplifiers etc. can be connected without complicating the overall structure and with efficient use of area. An embodiment of the present invention relates to a semiconductor memory system having a memory matrix area wherein many word lines and bit lines cross mutually in row and column directions and memory cells are arranged at the intersections of the word lines and bit lines with high integration density. A plurality of peripheral circuit blocks which are connected to a plurality of adjacent word lines and bit lines, for example, blocks providing sense amplifiers and decoder circuits, are sequentially arranged in files against the direction of the bit lines or word lines, respectively. Thereby, connections between the word lines or bit lines and peripheral circuits can be made without complicating the structure, and with effective use of areas. Thus, the present invention provides a semiconductor memory device providing the memory matrix area comprising plurality of wirings or wiring pairs crossed in both row and column directions and the memory cells arranged in the intersection thereof, wherein a plurality of peripheral circuit blocks connected to the adjacent plurality of wirings or wiring pairs in the predetermined number are sequentially arranged in the same direction as said wiring in such a manner that at least a part of said peripheral circuit block is arranged in files, and said wirings extended from said memory matrix area are connected to said peripheral circuit blocks.
