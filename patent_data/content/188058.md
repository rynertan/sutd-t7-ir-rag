# Directional circuit finder.

## Abstract
The invention provides an electronic detecting device for determining the direction of a source or a sink of an electrical signal in a medium permitting the signal to pass, comprising at least one set of at least two spatially separated receiving means A, B wherein each receiving means is capable of receiving the electrical signal a comparing means for comparing the strength of the electrical signal received at a first receiving means of said at least one set of receiving means to the strength of the electrical signal received at a selected other receiving means of said at least one set, for each set and an indicating means for indicating when the strength of the signal received at the first receiving means of said at least one set becomes either greater than or lesser than the strength of the signal received at the other selected receiving means of said at least one set, for each set. The invention includes a system incorporating such a device and a method of using such device for determining the direction of a source or a sink of an electrical signal in a medium permitting the signal to pass.
