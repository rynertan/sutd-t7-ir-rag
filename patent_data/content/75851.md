# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING HEARTBEAT RATE

## Abstract
Heart rate monitoring apparatus and a related method for detecting the successive beats of a heart and providing a reliable estimate of heartbeat rate. The apparatus comprises a heart rate monitor comprising means 15 for measuring the time intervals between successive beats of a heart and for producing a corresponding sequence of timing measure ments microprocessor means 17 for grouping the timing measurements into a prescribed set and adjusting a particu lar measurement of the set in a prescribed fashion, to produce an adjusted set of timing measurements, and for averaging the adjusted set of timing measurements, to produce an estimate of heartbeat rate. The particular mea surement that differs most from the computed average is adjusted to be equal to that average, and the adjusted set of measurements is then averaged. These latter steps of adjusting and averaging are repeated a prescribed number of times, and the last computed average is displayed as an estimate of heartbeat rate on a display 19 . The entire procedure is repeated upon the occurrence of each succes sive heartbeat.
