# CLOSE TOLERANCE INTERNAL GRINDING USING COOLANT MIST

## Abstract
In the internal grinding of a cylindrical bore having an oil or similar groove which adversely affects the bore round ness achievable, one or more streams of liquid coolant are directed over the grinding wheel during rough grinding at a high wheel feed rate and only a mist of liquid coolant droplets suspended in a compressed air stream is directed over the wheel once the high wheel feed rate has been reduced to the lower wheel feed rate associated with finish grinding. Means are provided for terminating the liquid coolant streams at the time the wheel feed rate is changed or after a short delay period thereafter to establish equili brium finish grind conditions. Preferably, the change from one or more liquid coolant streams to the coolant mist is made in response to a detected decrease in wheel spindle motor power.
