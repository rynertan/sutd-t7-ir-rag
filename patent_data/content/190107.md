# LASER EQUIPMENT FOR MEDICAL USE

## Abstract
In laser equipment as disclosed, which is intended for medical use, a number of laser devices 1 of the semicon ductor type are ranged in succession one alongside the next such that the axes of the relative beams 2 emitted are disposed substantially parallel and lie within a common plane the beams are directed at a focusing medium of elongated form embodied as a cylindrical lens 3 the longitudinal axis of which lies perpendicular to the parallel axes of the laser beams 2 . The lens 3 focuses the beams 2 emitted by the laser devices 1 into a corresponding number of emergent beams 5 the cross sections 6 of which each exhibit one dimension significantly greater than the other. The beam cross sections lie in close proximity one to the next, aligned end to end through their longitudinal dimension, thereby forming what is substantially a con tinuous section of laser radiation in the form of a thin strip 7 .
