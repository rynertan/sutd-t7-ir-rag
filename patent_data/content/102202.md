# Document sheet feeding and registration apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A document sheet feeding and registration apparatus and method are described for deskewing a document sheet 7 relative to a desired copying position on a copier platen 3 while feeding the document sheet onto the platen into said copying position. The method and apparatus include obtaining an electrical signal corresponding to the actual velocity of the document sheet 7 being fed onto the platen 3 , and actuating an automatic document sheet deskewing device 16, 17 at a precise actuating time occurring sligntly before the document sheet reaches the copying position, so that the actuating time of said document sheet 7 deskewing corresponds to the actual velocity of the document sheet. The electrical signal corresponding to the actual document sheet velocity may be obtained by counting the elapsed time between the actuation of first and second switches 30, 31 substantially spaced from one another along the document sheet path upstream of the copier platen 3 . The actuating time of the document sheet deskewing device may be a resettable time delay count after the actuation of said second switch 31 , which time delay count is resettable by a change in the counted time period between the actuation of said first and second switches 30, 31 . The automatic document sheet deskewing device 16, 17 may comprise a releasable skew preventing document feeder 17 releasing the document sheet 7 at said actuating time to another feeder 16 for briefly driving the document sheet 7 into a registration aligning edge 18 while freely allowing deskewing move ment of the document sheet 7 thereagainst after said actuating time.
