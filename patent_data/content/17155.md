# Adsorbent fractionators with electronic sequence timer cycle control and process.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for absorbing one or more first gases from a mixture thereof with a second gas to reduce the concentration of first gas in the mixture to below a permissible maximum concentration by passing the mixture in contact with and from one end to another end of one of two beds of a sorbent having a preferential affinity for the first gas, adsorbing first gas thereon to form a gaseous effluent having a concentration thereof below the maximum, and forming a concentration gradient of first gas in the bed progressively decreasing from one end to the other end as the adsorption continues and an increasing concentration of first gas in the bed defining a concentration front progres sively advancing in the bed from the one end to the other end as sorbent capacity therefor decreases, and then while passing a purge flow of gaseous effluent through the other of the two beds of sorbent to desorb first gas adsorbed thereon, and reverse the advance of the concentration front of first gas in the bed, regenerating the other bed for another cycle of adsorption periodically interchanging the beds so that, alternately, one bed is on regeneration and the other on the adsorption portions of the cycle timing the cycling in fixed timing intervals determined electronically by a combination of digital integrated circuitry including a time delay oscilla tor, a binary counter and a logic module and controlling cycling time at a period not shorter than the regeneration time and switching the sorbent beds at the end of such cycling time. The system is particularly applicable to the drying of gases.
