# Crystalline polybutene 1 compositions.

## Abstract
A crystalline polybutene 1 composition contains from 1 10 ‚Å∂ to 10 by weight of a vinylcycloalkane polymer having a melting point of 180 C or higher in terms of its homopolymer. The composition has a markedly improved rate of crystal conversion of polybutene 1 from the metast able to the stable crystalline form.
