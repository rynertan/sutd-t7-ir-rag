## Description
MIS IC PROTECTED FROM STATIC CHARGE BREAKDOWN The present invention relates to a metal insulator semiconductor MIS type integrated circuit IC which is protected from damage caused by static charge. A problem which can occur during handling of ICs is static charge breakdown, due to which an IC which has passed testing is found not to work properly when it is mounted on a printed circuit board. Static charge breakdown occurs when static charge is conducted to theIC during handling, causing a surge of static charge in the IC. The incidence of static charge breakdown is particularly high for MIS type ICs MIS ICs for which it is to some extent an inherent problem. This is because, in MIS ICs an upper layer of the IC is highly insulated from its surroundings by an insulating film, and has a fine gate structure which is very fragile. Attempts have been made to increase the ability ofICs to withstand static charge. Surge protection has been devised for an input terminal or input electrode of input transistors of the IC, and this is effective to some extent in decreasing the damage caused by surges of static charge. But the protection given is still inadequate, and occasionally ICs provided with protection circuits are found to be damaged by surges. According to the present invention, there is provided a MIS IC Metal Insulator Semiconductor typeIntegrated Circuit including input circuitry connected between first and second voltage supply lines of the IC, comprising an input MIS transistor the gate of which is connected to an input pad of the IC, and a protection MIS transistor, the gate of which is connected to the first voltage supply line, connected between the input circuitry and the second voltage supply line. The inventor of the present invention has established that damage to previous surge protected ICs occurs almost always in an input circuit of the IC which is located at the periphery of the chip, and that damage hardly ever occurs in inner logic circuits, which constitute the main part of the IC. From further investigation the inventor has discovered that the damage is concentrated in a MIS transistor of an input circuit whose source or drain is connected to a voltage source line. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a protection circuit in a MIS IC, for protection against static charge breakdown. More precisely, an embodiment of the present invention can improve the ability of an IC to resist static charge breakdown, by providing a circuit to protect an input circuit in the IC. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a protection circuit placed between a voltage source line and an input circuit of a MIS IC which increases the ability of the IC to resist static charge breakdown. An embodiment of the present invention can also decrease the incidence of failure of MIS ICs caused by static charge breakdown. The inventor supposes that for protection against static charge breakdown, it is inadequate merely to protect an input terminal side, as breakdown is caused not only from an input terminal side but also from surges induced in a voltage supply line. With this consideration, according to the present invention static charge protection is attained by providing a protection MIS transistor between an input circuit and a voltage supply line of the input circuit. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a MIS inverter used for an input circuit of a prior art IC circuit Fig. 2 shows schematically the structure of a portion of an IC die corresponding to the circuit of Fig.1 Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram of an input circuit protected from static charge breakdown embodying the present invention Fig. 4 shows schematically the structure of a portion of an IC die corresponding to Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram for another embodiment of the present invention. Throughout the drawings like reference numerals or characters designate like or similar parts. Fig. 1 shows an example of a C MIS ComplementaryMetal Insulator Semiconductor type inverter for an input circuit of a prior art MIS IC. The circuit comprises series connected p channel and n channel MIS transistors Trl and Tr2. Commonly connected gates of these transistors are connected to an input pad PD, to which an input signal is applied. Sources of the transistors Tr and Tr2 are respectively connected to Vcc and Vss GND lines, for supply from the positive and negative or ground sides of a power supply source, respectively. Static charge breakdown may occur when an input terminal a pin of the IC package is contacted by a finger or instrument. Therefore, as mentioned, static charge protection has so far been concentrated upon the input terminal side of the IC. Many protection circuits are known for example as disclosed in U.S. PatentApplication No. 556,097, Nov. 29, 1983 by YoshihiroTakemae . Commonly, a diode is implemented in the place marked C in Fig. 1 to absorb surge voltages. Most known protection circuits are effective to some extent in reducing incidence of failure caused by static charge breakdown. But failure occurs even in devices provided with surge protection circuits. The inventor has determined that failures of ICs provided with protection circuits occur in I O Input Output circuits of the ICs which are usually located on the peripheries of the IC dies for processing I O signals. Moreover, such failures are concentrated almost one hundred percent in input circuits of the I O circuits.This may be understood by the fact that an input circuit of an I O circuit is more fragile than an output circuit of an I O circuit, which is composed from larger transistors than those in the input circuit. The inventor discovered that failure does not occur in inner circuits located in the centre part of anIC die, which comprise a plurality of fine MIS transistors and which perform the main part of the IC logic. The reason why these inner circuits do not suffer from static charge breakdown will be discussed later.Further investigation indicated that failure often occurs in the gate of a transistor, e.g. Trl in Fig. 1, which is connected to a power supply line Vcc in an I O circuit. Fig. 2 shows schematically a cross sectional view of an IC die, illustrating the structure of a portion relevant to failure of the circuit of Fig. 1. In theFigure, 1 is an n type semiconductor substrate, 2 and 3 are source and drain regions of the p channel MIS transistor Trl, 4 is a gate insulation film and 5 is a gate electrode. The voltage supply line Vcc is usually constituted by an aluminium wiring layer, which in this example is connected to the p region 3. Precise observation indicated that in an input circuit having a construction as shown in part by Fig. 2, breakdown failure is caused by damage to the gate oxide layer 4 of Trl in particular, the damage occurs in the region marked 4a in the Figure, that is the side of the gate which is adjacent to the Vcc line. The inventor believes that the mechanism of such failure is as follows. If an IC package is contacted by a finger or instrument when under a floating condition, that is when the IC is not connected to a circuit not mounted on a printed circuit board , there is a chance that a surge of static charge will occur. If the surge occurs in an input terminal pin of the package, the IC may be protected by a surge protection circuit as previously proposed, if one is provided, but if the surge occurs in the Vcc line via a voltage source pin , the IC has no protection an Consider the case of Fig. 1, for example. When IC package containing this circuit is in a floating condition, the transistors Tr and Tr2 are not working, i.e. they are OFF because their electrodes are not supplied with the required voltage.Therefore they act merely as a resistance between Vcc and Vss. If a surge occurs in the Vcc line the electrode 3 of Trl, which is connected to Vcc, will reach a high voltage relative to V55 ground . Voltage build up at the gate electrodes of Trl and Tr2 is very slow compared to that of Vcc, since the gates have a large capacitance C with respect to the substrate SUB or ground GND, because the gates are connected to the input pad PD and to a surge protection circuit not shown which usually comprises a diode having a large capacitance with respect to ground. Therefore, at an instant when a surge occurs in the Vcc line , the voltage between the electrode 3 for example the source electrode of Trl and the gate electrode 5 is highest, so static breakdown occurs at the point 4a in Fig. 2. Once static breakdown has occurred, a surge current runs through the point 4a to the gate electrode 5 and input pad PD, and the pad is charged up to a high voltage. Owing to the large capacitance C or surge protection circuit provided in the input side, the ground of the IC package is then charged up, and the surge is over. This process can occur with a surge voltage of either polarity. The above explanation has been made with respect to the example of part of an input circuit shown in Fig.1, but it will be understood that the situation for other types of input circuit is similar. In other types of input circuit also, the gate of a MIS transistor in a region adjacent to a Vcc line, is where static charge breakdown occurs. With respect to the inner circuitry of a MIS IC which is composed of a plurality of C MIS circuits similar to that of Fig. 1, a gate wiring line of eachC MIS circuit is very thin and short compared to that of an input circuit. Moreover, the inner C MIS circuits do not include an input pad PD, so their gate capacitance against ground is very small compared to that of an input circuit. Accordingly, when a surge voltage appears in the Vcc line, gate voltages in the inner circuitry vary in close correspondence to the variation of Vcc, so breakdown does not occur, and the inner circuitry is not damaged by static charge breakdown. The observation that an input circuit suffers static charge breakdown, but inner circuitry does not, may also be explained as follows. In the transient state during a surge of static charge, an inner C MIS circuit may be considered as a mere resistance and very small capacitance connected between Vcc and Vss or GND. So, as mentioned before, Vss and GND are charged up rapidly and their potentials follow the voltage of Vcc. Hence the inner circuitry does not suffer static charge breakdown.By contrast, the gate circuit in an input circuit for example, the circuit of the gates of Trl and Tr2 in Fig.1 is isolated from the GND or Vss line, and has a large capacitance. So, the change of potential of the gates is delayed with respect to the variation of potential of the VCC or GND line. From these considerations, it was decided to provide a protection circuit for an input circuit of aMIS IC in order to protect it perfectly from static charge breakdown. For such a protection circuit, it is not possible to provide a diode as for an input electrode to absorb the surge current, as such a diode would short the source voltage. The requirements for the static charge protection circuit are firstly, to absorb surges of static charge whenever the electrodes are not supplied with a proper operating voltage, and secondly, when a proper operating voltage is applied to the circuit, to have no detrimental effect upon the operation of the main circuitry. The present invention provides a protection circuit which fulfils these requirements. Fig. 3 shows a circuit diagram for part of an input circuit for a MIS IC protected from static charge breakdown by a protection circuit, as a first embodiment of the present invention. In comparison with the circuit of Fig. 1, the circuit of Fig. 3 additionally comprises a protection transistor Tr inserted between a transistor of the input circuit Tr1 and the voltage source line Vcc. In this embodiment, the protection transistor Tr3 is a p channel MIS transistor and gate of Tr3 is connected to V55 GND , the negative side source line or ground line. Fig. 4 shows a cross sectional view of the circuit of Fig. 3. Like reference numerals designate parts corresponding to those in Fig. 2. In the Figure, 4 is a gate insulation film of the protection transistor Tr and 7 is its drain or source constituted by a p type region. The operation and effect of the protection circuit is as follows. When the IC is loaded on a printed circuit board and supplied with a proper voltage, the protection transistor Tr3 is conductive, so that 3 transistor Trl of the input circuit is supplied with the source voltage V001 as the voltage drop across Tr3 is negligibly small. Therefore, the input circuit operates as normal. When the IC is floating, that is the IC is not connected to an external circuit, and if a static surge appears on the Vcc line, due to contact with the voltage source pin of the IC package by a human finger, for example, the potential on the Vcc line goes up very rapidly.At the same time the potential of the ground line GND also goes up, because GND is in a floating condition and is hence charged up through the main logic circuitry of the IC not shown , which can be considered at this time to act as a resistance and capacitance between Vcc and V55 or GND. Therefore, when Vcc and GND are in a floating state, their potentials vary almost identically with variation of Vcc. This explains again the fact that main logic circuitry inner circuitry does not suffer from static charge breakdown. At this time, therefore, the transistor Tr3 is cut off or nearly cut off, and the input circuit in particular, the inverter Trl and Tr2 is protected.It will be clear that the protection effect does not depend on the polarity of the surge voltage. Fig. 5 shows an input circuit provided with another protection circuit, as a second embodiment of the present invention, using an n channel MIS transistor.In comparison with Fig. 3, the p channel MIS transistorTr3 is replaced by an n channel MIS transistor Tr4. This is inserted between the negative side voltage source line V55 or ground line GND and the input circuit transistor Tr2, as the protection transistor. The gate of the protection transistor Tr4 is connected to VCc. The construction of the device will be easily understood by analog y with the above explanation regarding Fig. 4.Therefore, it will not described herein for the sake of simplicity. In the circuit of Fig. 5, when a normal operating voltage is supplied, the protection transistor Tr4 is in a conductive state, so the input circuit inverter Tr and Tr2 works normally. On the other hand, when the IC is floating and a surge voltage appears on the Vcc line, the potential of the Vss line or that line follows that of the Vcc line, so the transistor Tr4 is cut off, and the input circuit is protected.Again, the protection effect does not depend on the polarity of the surge potential. The design of the protection transistor Tr3 or Tr4 is not critical. It is not necessary to make Tri or Tr4 especially large, because the current which Trl or Tr2 must supply is relatively small, since the input circuit does not consume much current. In practice, there are many types of transistor pattern in a typical MIS IC especially in LSI Large Scale Integration devices, so any one MIS transistor pattern can be used for the protection transistor, which can be fabricated at the same time as the transistors of that pattern. For example, the pattern used may be the same as that of the input circuit transistors Trl or Tr2. Therefore, it will be clear that fabrication of a protection circuit in accordance with the present invention does not require additional processing steps for a typical IC. Some modifications to the protection circuits described above may occur to those skilled in the art.For example, both p channel and n channel MIS transistors may be provided in respect of the same input circuit, for example in the respective positions of Tr3 and Tr4 inFigs. 3 and 5. Such modifications are all within the scope of the present invention. It is difficult to verify the actual operation mechanism of the protection circuit, since static charge surges are transient phenomena of very short duration.Therefore, the explanation given above concerning the operation of the protection circuit should be regarded only as a tentative explanation. Nevertheless, IC circuits provided with static charge protection circuits in accordance with the present invention show excellent resistance to static charge breakdown. The following test was performed on ICs which were not connected to an external circuit. A charge pulse was applied to the Vcc pin of an IC package from a condenser of 100 pF charged up to a predetermined voltage, to simulate a surge of static charge. The IC was then tested to see if static charge breakdown had occurred.These steps were repeated, increasing the voltage of the condenser, until breakdown of the IC had occurred. Prior art ICs were found to break down at below 500 volts.However, ICs provided with a protection circuit in accordance with the present invention were found to withstand more than 1,500 volts. As has been described above, a protection circuit in accordance with the present invention is very effective for protecting a MIS IC from damage by static charge breakdown.
