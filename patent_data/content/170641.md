# A drive system for a.c. voltage motors.

## Abstract
A drive system for a group of brushless A.C. motors 15 which have mutually different working characteristics, for example mutually different supply voltage frequencies, and which are arranged to be supplied with electric energy from a static converter 4 . The system is characterized in that all motors 15 are arranged to be connected electrically, one at a time, to one and the same converter, and in that an identifying means 10, 13 which is individual to each motor is arranged to be connected to a control input 8, 9 on the converter in order to regulate the converter so that it generates electric energy with the necessary supply para meters to the motor. The invention also covers a hand tool to be used in the system.
