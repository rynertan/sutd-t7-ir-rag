# Process for preparing carboxylic acid.

## Abstract
This invention provides a process for preparing carboxyl ic acid, the process comprising subjecting an oxidation pro duct produced by reacting a peroxide with a unsaturated ali phatic monocarboxylic acid having at least one unsaturated bond in the carbon chain and containing 6 to 24 carbon atoms or its ester or b cyclic and or acyclic aliphatic olefin having at least one unsaturated bond in the carbon chain to oxidation by oxygen or oxygen containing gas in the presence of a catalyst comprising i at least one heavy metal compound and ii at least one member selected from the group consisting of a bro mine compound and a chlorine compound.
