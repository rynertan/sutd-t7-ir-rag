# Removal of halogen from halogenated compounds.

## Abstract
A method for removing halogen from halogenated compounds employs an electrochemical process utilising an electrically conducting liquid medium in a cell having a sacrificial anode. Halogen is extracted and reacted with a metal present in the sacrificial node to form a relatively insoluble metal halide salt. The invention is of especial utility in removing halogen from aromatic and aliphatic com pounds, for example, polyhalogenated hydrocarbons.
