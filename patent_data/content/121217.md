# Output buffer circuit.

## Abstract
An output buffer circuit has a data input terminal IN which receives logic data, load and drive transistors 20, 22 , a driver 24 for selectively turning on the transistors 20, 22 in accordance with the logic value of the logic data, a data output terminal OUT which is connected to a power source terminal VD of the VDD level through a current path of the load transistor 20 and is grounded through a current path of the drive transistor 22 , and a capacitor 26 connected as a load to the data output terminal OUT . The output buffer circuit further has a transition detector circuit 46 for generating a pulse signal in response to a change in level of each of address signals A1 AN , and a preset circuit 48 for supplying, in response to the pulse signal, a charge or discharge current to the capacitor 26 while a voltage at the data output terminal OUT is not at the VDD 2 level.
