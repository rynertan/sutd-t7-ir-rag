# POWER SOURCE FOR DISCHARGE MACHINING

## Abstract
A power source for discharge machining of the type in which the charging current of a discharging capacitor C is controlled by switching elements Tr1, Tr2 . A large current charging circuit A which will be turned on and off with a pulse width comparable to the pulse width of discharge current of the discharging capacitor C is arranged in parallel with a small current circuit B which will be turned on and off maintaining a much longer period. The large current charging circuit A participates in the charging operation only when the small current circuit is being turned on and the charging voltage of the discharging capacitor C is smaller than a predetermined value.
