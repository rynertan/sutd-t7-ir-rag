# Earth engaging agricultural implement and method of making same.

## Abstract
An agricultural earth engaging implement is formed from two metal plate sections connected together. A narrow shaft 3 defines a recess 6 which tapers downwardly and is of generally triangular section with its apex pointing in the intended direction of travel of the implement. The lower end of the shaft 3 is connected to the rear of the earth engaging portion 8 and extends upwardly and rearwardly therefrom. The implement is retained on a tine of an agricultural machine by the reactive force exerted by the soil and the narrow shaft 3 may be dragged through the soil with relatively low resistance due to its small width and due to the fact that its triangular section prevents a build up of soil occurring at its front end.
