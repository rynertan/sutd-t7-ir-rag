## Description
METHOD OF PREPARATION OF POLYESTER This invention relates to an improved method of preparation of polyester, being enhanced in the decomposition stability in the polycondensation reaction by using a novel phosphorus compound, in production of polyester, especially thermoplastic polyester of which principal chain is wholly or partly linear. A polyester, for example, polytetramethylene terephthalate which is a linear thermoplastic polyester may be decomposed in molecules or coloured due to the effects of heat, oxygen air , light or the iike dur.i ng its manufacture. during processing after manufacture, or during use. Ln particular, in the fusion and polycondensation reaction process, a desired degree of polymerization may not be achieved due to pyrolysis.Still worse. due to such pyrolysis. a low molecular weight matter may be formed and collected in the polymerization apparatus, which may seriously affect the subsequent operation of the apparatus. To avoid such trouble, conventionally, antioxidant of phenol compound, amine compound. phosphoric acid, ester phosphate, phosphrous acid, ester phosphite and the like have been used as the stabilizers in preparation of polyester. These materials were not sufficient i n the efficacy, and amine compound s, in particular, had a disadvantage of extremely colouring the stabilized polyester due to the effect of heat and light.In this background. the present inventors have been intensively studying to obtain a polyester which is hardly decomposed and is never coloured due to the effects of heat, oxygen air , light or the like during and after the manufacture of polyester. As a result, it has been found that the above discussed problems may be solved by adding a phosphonite compound shown in the general formula I EMI2.1 where each of R1 R2, R3 and R4 is an alkyl group, a substitutioned alkyl group and aryl group or a substitutioned aryl group with the number of carbons ranging either equally or differently from 1 to 25, and 5R denotes an alkyl group a substituted alkyl group, an aryl group or a substituted aryl group with the number of carbons ranging from 4 to 33, in the process of preparation of polyester composed of a residual group of dicarboxylic acid and a residual group of hydroxy compound as principal constituent units of the polyester, which has led to this invention. The polyester prepared in this method may be either homopolyester or copolyester. Examples of material monomer of the residual group of dicarboxylic acid as the constituent unit of the polyester may include terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalein 2, 6 dicarboxylic acid, diphenyl dicarboxylic acid, diphenylether dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, and other known residual group of dicarboxylic acid. and its lowerfatty acid esters. On the other hand, examples of material monomer of residual group of hydroxy compound as other constituent unit to compose ester include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane diol, neopentyle glycol, methylpropane diol, cyclohexane dimethanol, xylilene diol, hydroquinone. bisphenol A and other hydroxy compounds.Furthermore, the polyester of this invention may contain a moity of a residual group of a compound intended to modify the polyester. Examples of residual group of such compound include p hydroxy benzoic acid, 3,5 dicarboxybenzene sodium sulfonate, di hydroxyethyl ether of tetrabrom bisphenol A, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol, oligoamide, oligocarbonate. and residual group of such compounds, trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, trimethylol propane, glycerin, pentaerythritol, and residual group of other multifunctional compounds. The polyester manufactured in this invention is a thermoplastic polyester of which principle chain is wholly or partly linear. In the process of ester exchange reaction or esterification reaction, a polyester precursor is synthesized, and in the subsequent process of polycondensation reaction, a polymer is produced by a conventional method. As the catalyst, any known material may be used, of which examples include calcium, magnesium, zinc, cadmium or other II a, b group metal, titanium, germanium, tin, lead, antimony, manganese or other.. IV. a0. b group or V b group metals inorganic acid salt , organic acid salt, hydroxide, oxide, and alkoxide. In the formula of a novel phosphonite compound expressed in the general formula I which is used in this invention each of R1 R2 R3 and R4is, as mentioned above, an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, an aryl group or a substituted aryl group with the number of carbons ranging from 1 to 25, whether being identical of different. Their examples may include methyl, ethyl, butyl, octyl, decyl, lauryl, tridecyl, stearyl, phenyl, alkyl and or alkoxy substituted phenyls. 5R denotes an alkyl ene group, a substituted alkyl ene group, an aryl ene group or a substituted aryl ene group with the number of carbons ranging from 4 to 33, of which examples may include butylene, octylene, phenylene, naphthylene, diphenylene. andEMI4.1 where X is any one of oxy group, sulfonyl group, carbonyl group, methylene group, ethylidene group, butylidene group, isopropyl group, and diazo group, etc. A particularly preferable phosphonite compound is tetrakis 2,4 di t butylphenyl 4,4 diphenylene phosphonite. One or more types of these phosphonite compounds may be used in mixture. Such phosphonite compounds may be added at any desired timing during or after blending of the monomer material, but the initial reaction may be retarded when the addition is made added before or in the early stage of ester exchange reaction or direct esterification reaction. Therefore, it is preferable to add in the next step, that is, during the process of polycondensation reaction.For instance, when manufacturing polytetramethylene terephthalate as polyester, a polyester precursor is synthesized in the process of ester exchange reaction of dimethyl terephthalic acid and butane 1,4 diol or esterification reaction of terephthalic acid and butane 1,4 diol. and then by adding said phosphonite compound s before the process of polycondenation process or before the viscosity begins to elevate in the midst of the process, a polymeris manufactured. In particular, when the phosphonite compound is added in the earlier stage of the polycondensation reaction, it is more effective to inhibit decomposition during polycondensation reaction and obtain a higher degree of polymerization. Not to mention, the phosphonite compound of this invention is effective in maintaining the stability of formed article if added during extrusion pelletization or forming after completion of polymerization of polyester. Such phosphonite compound is preferably added so as to be contained by 0.002 wt. to 1.0 wt. of the obtained polyester. If added more than 1.0 wt. , the rate of polymerization becomes slow, and a desired effect may not be obtained. A preferable addition is 0.01 wt. to 0.5 wt. , or more preferably 0.03 wt. to 0.3 wt. . In polycondensation by adding the phosphonite compound of this invention, it is also possible to add known additives as required depending on the purposes, such as titanium oxide, carbon black or other pigment, and stabilizer, plasticizer, filler, nucleating agent, lubricant, flame retardant, and glass fiber and other reinforcing agents. According to this invention, since the effect to inhibit pyrolysis in manufacture of polyester is great, a higher degree of polymerization not experienced in the conventional fusion polymerization method may be easily achieved, and the time to obtain a desired degree of polymerization is shorter than in the conventional process. At the same time, thermal deterioration, oxidation deterioration and colouring are scarce. during processing after manufacture or during use.
