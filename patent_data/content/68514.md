# A process for fractionating a methanol containing methyl tertiary butyl ether reactor effluent.

## Abstract
Butenes are added to the methanol containing me thyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE reactor effluent frac tionation to effect recovery of substantially methanol free MTBE bottoms product. Methanol analysis taken below the fractionator feed locus manipulates control of butenes addition. In an embodiment, the methanol butenes containing overhead stream from the fractio nation is treated over activated alumina to adsorb methanol, yielding a methanol free butenes feed for HF alkylation of isobutane. The used adsorbent can be re generated using hot butenes product and or MTBE reac tor feed vapor with the recovered methanol being re cycled to the MTBE reaction.
