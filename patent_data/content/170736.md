## Description
PIPELINE FAULT STATUS MONITORING SYSTEM l .is invention relates generally to fault sensing alarm monitors and more particularly to a system for sensing malfunctions and or potentially hazardous conditions occurring in a pipeline fluid distribution system, and to provide information as to the location of the fault condition in the system. Pipelines have been a major source of spills over the years for both oil production and distribution. These problems could range from small flowline leaks to a break in the Alaskan pipeline. At the present time, typical known methods to detect an oil leak include . 1 Visual by air 2 Visual by walking 3 Flowmeters The visual method, either on the ground or from the air, has obvious disadvantages such as when the view is obscurred by trees or shrubs, or when inclement weather prevents viewing. These methods are also costly and time consuming. With current technology using flowmeters, a small leak in a large liquid or gas pipeline will not be detected due to equipment inaccuracies and a small leak in the wrong place at the wrong time can be tremendously expensive. Therefore, a means is needed to detect a leak at any point along a pipeline in a highly reliable manner. At the outset it is recognized a few of the characteristics that the pipeline leak detector must have are 1 High Reliability 2 Resistance to Hostile Environment i.e., materials utilized must be relatively inert and components sealed 3 Repairability Maintainability 4 System Expandablity 5 Adjustable System Accuracv 6 Ease of Installation without specialized training Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pipe malfunction sensing system which uniquely meets the above criteria. The present invention is featured in the provision of a communication system composed of a number of small transmitters disposed along the expanse of pipeline, each with an associated malfunction sensing means which detects a fault cnndition occurring along the expanse of pi e between that transmitter and a next adjacent transmitter. The transmitters are serially connected by a common communications cable and are caused to provide status information to a central control station as to transmitter identification, pipeline status i.e., leak information as concerns the associate expanse of pipeline, and miscellaneous information as to temperature, pressure, etc. A fuzther object of the present invention is the provision of a new and useful fiber optic oil leak sensor for incorporation in the above defined communication system. A still further object of the present invention is the provision of a pipeline malfunction monitoring system employing components easily attachable along the pipeline expanse. These and further objects and features of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following description with reference to the accom.anying drawings in which Figure 1 is a functional diaram of a pipeline fault monitoring system in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a functional block diagram of a typical transmitter assembly as employed in the system of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a functional schematic depicting intermittent power control of the transmitter units in the monitoring system Figure 4 depicts the type of binary encoded signal developed by the transmitter encoders Figure 5 is a side view of transmitter mounting and interconnect detail on a pipeline to be monitored Figure 6 is a partial section view along line 6 6 of Figure 5, showing communication cable, sensing cable and mounting means and Figure 7 is a partial sectional view of oil sensing cable as may be employed with each of the transmitter assemblies on the monitoring system. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The heart of the pipeline monitoring system to be described herein is a communication system composed of a plurality of small transmitter units which are serially connected by a communication cable and are attached to the pipeline at spaced locations over the entire length of the system to be monitored. These transmitting units provide status information to a central control station. The status information, as will be described, comprises transmitter identification for purposes of identifying the location of a particular fault being monitored, pipeline status for indicating that a particular status being monitored is normal or faulty, and miscellaneous information which might comprise temperature, pressure, etc. Each of the transmitting units, as will be further described, is connected to a common twisted pair communicatffions cable and each of the transmitting units is associated with a sensor which detects the presence of pipeline fault condition along a section of the pipeline between that transmitter and the next adjacent one of the transmitting units. A central control station is placed at a convenient location for monitoring the overall status of the pipeline. The central control station receives the encoded messages from all of the transmitters over a shared communication cable and may automatically receive, decode and print out the pipeline status. When a fault condition occurs in that section of the pipeline with which a particular one of the plural fault monitors is associated, the.transmitting unit associated with that fault monitor responds to the fault condition defined by the monitor input thereto and the encoded message in that transmitting unit is changed to indicate a fault has been detected at that location in the pipeline expanse. The transmitter is then enreadied to send a new message to the central control station, wherearon the central control station receives and decodes the message and may provide means to activate an alarm and print out the transmitter identification code and location of the expanse of pipe in which the fault has occurred. As will be further described, each of the transmitting units is adapted to transmit on an intermittent basis such that the transmissions from any one of the plural transmitters is not synchronous with those of the other transmitters in the system. In the embodiment to be described, the fault monitoring comprises the detection of oil leaks in an oil carrying pipeline system and the fault sensor associated with each of the plural transmitter units compriseS a novel optical oil sensor cable which extends from any one transmitter unit along the expanse of pipeline to the next succeeding one of the transmitter units, whereby each of the transmitter units monitors a particular length of pipeline and detects oil leakage over that associated length.As will be described, in this particular embodiment, each of the transmitting units comprises optical electronics which generates a light source for transmission through an optical fiber which extends the length of the pipeline section to be monitored and returns on itself in a continuous loop to be received by the optical electronics in the transmitting unit. The level of the received light is detected, with the level of the detected signal being definitive of whether there is oil leakage along that section of the optical cable associated with the transmitter unit. In general, it will be seen that the attenuation characteristic introduced into the optical fiber loop by the presence of oil on the cable alters the transmission charactristica of the optical fiber and this information may be utilized to develop a fault annunciation which can be encoded and transmitted to the central control station. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention will now be described as it may be employed in detecting oil leaks in a pipeline distribution system, wherein the fault monitoring sensors associated with each of plural transmitting units comprises an optical fiber continuous loop carried by an optical cable to be defined, and sensitive to the presence of oil to exhibit an increased attenuation characteristic which can be detected and utilized as a fault annunciation. It is to be understood, however, that the inventive concept in general extends to the use of other than this type of fault sensor. With reference to Figure 1, a pipeline fault monitoring system in accordance with the present invention is generally depicted. A pipeline network 10 carrying oil 12 is shown. A plurality of transmitter units such as 16a, 16b and 16c are shown to be disposed in space separated relationship along the extent of the pipeline network. The transmitter sensor assemblies 16 are depicted in Figure 1 as being functionally interconnected serially along a common communication cable 14 and each of the transmitter sensor assemblies 16 has associated therewith a fault sensing means depicted functionally in Figure 1 as respective optical fiber loops 19z, 18b, 18c, etc. Each of the sensor means 18 is seen to be associated with the extent of pipeline between successive ones of transmitter units 16.Thus, a sensor 18a is seen to extend from transmitter unit 16a along the pipeline 10 to the next succeeding transmitting unit 16b, etc. The common communications cable 14 is carried to a central control station 20 to receive transmissions from the transmitting units located along the extent of the pipeline network 10.It is noted that where branches may occur in the pipeline system, the communications cable 14 may simply be branched out with repeated trans mltting units and associated sensing units then extending down the various branch lines. As will be described, each of the transmitting units 16 is caused to inter Jttently transmit, on the common communications cable 14, a digitally encoded message which will indicate transmitter location, a fault no fault onitorjfl Status, among with other infonation as may be desired In the system. The central control station 2S, as depicted in Figure 1, comprises a power supply 22 which, through interconnection 23, may be tied to the common communicatIon cable 14 se ns to deliver power to the individual transmitting units 16 placed along the pipeline network.Central control station 20 is shown as further comprising a receiver 24 with the input to the receiver 24 being the output from the common ct, nnunications cable 14. The receiver 24 provides an output to a decoder unit 26 to decode the transmissions emanating from the plural transmitting units 16. The central control station further may comprise a microprocessor 28, which, in response to the output from the decoder 26, may operate a printer alarm unit 30, such that when a transmitted message is received which comprises a fault condition, the printer alarm 30 may be caused to print out the location of the transmitter from which the fault condition emanates and or to sound an appropriate alarm to indicate that a fault condition has occurred in the pipeline network. A typical transmitter encoder assembly 16 is depicted functionally in Figure 2. Optical oil sensing cable 18, comprising the fault sensor means of the embodiment being described, is shown functionally as having transmitted, through an optical fiber loop, a light source emanating from optical electronics block 32 and returned to the optical electronics block 32. Optical electronics block 32 may conventially include an emitter which is a light source for the optical fiber loop and a detector which converts the light output of the fiber into an electrical signal.Such units are commercially available. The emitter may comprise a laser diode which has an output within the infrared spectrum wavelength 0.8 to 1.2 meters . The optical electronics 32 may then further comprise a threshold comparator means such that when the output from the detector falls below a predetermined threshold level, a fault condition is defined.The output from the optical electronics circuitry 32, which may comprise this threshold detection signal, is shown applied as input 34 to an encoder unit 36. As will be further described, encoder unit 36 provides an input 38 to transmitter 40 to cause the transmitter 40 to output on line pair 42 and 44 which lines are tied to the lines 46 and 48 which comprise the common communications cable 14 so as to transmit a predetermined signal back to the central control station 20. As depicted in Figure 4, the encoder 36 associated with the transmitter unit 16 may provide a digital output signal exampled as three bits defining the start of a transmission sequence, twelve bits defining the address of the particular transmitter unit 16, one bit defining a go no go condition as to whether there is a fault detected or not, four bits reserved for miscellaneous information such as temperature, pressure, etc., and two bits defining the stop of the transmission sequence. Each of the transmitter encoder assemblies 16 may thus be provided with a unique 12 bit address which is the identification number for that transmitter. Each transmittertencoder assembly 16 may convert the binary bit stream from the encoder 36 to a frequency shift keying FSK transmission signal such as to transmit, on the common communication cable 14, audio frequencies of 2910 Hz and 2010 Hz which represent respectively a binary one and a binary zero. In this system, audio frequencies are preferably utilized to reduce attenuation which may become a problem with radio frequencies over long distances which may be encountered in such a monitoring system. In accordance with the present inurztion, each of the transmitting units 16 would be caused to transmit on an intermittent basis that is, tranrnissions from any one trarsmitter unit would not be synchronous in any manner with those from any other ones of the transmitting units.Reference is made to Figure 3 which functionally depicts a simple control system by means of which each of the transmitting units might be energized to transmit the then encoded status and identification message.With reference to Figure 3, each transmitting unit 16 might be battery powered by means of a battery 33 which powers the FSK transmitter 39 through a control switch 35. Control switch 35 might be operated by any one of known types of intermittent switch control circuitries 37 so as to intermittently close the switch 35 to applied power from the battery 33 to the transmitter 39. As shown in Figure 3, a typical transmitter unit is shown tied to the common communication line 14 by means of interconnections 42 and 44. As previously described, with reference to Figure 1, the central control station may provide a power supply for use with the entire monitoring system, with the power being applied on the same two lines 46 and 48 that comprises the common communications cable to which the output of each FSK transmitter 39 is connected. Thus, power supplied on the lines 46 and 48 may be utilized to charge the battery 33, with the battery 33 supplying power through intermittent switch 35 to power the FSK transmitter. The intermittent switch control 37 might, for example, comprise a simple capacitor charging arrangement by means of which the switch 35 may be closed on an intermittent basis. It is to be emphasized that the intermittent powering of the FSK transmitter 39 need not be on a periodic basis, since the system will operate on the improbability of more than one transmitter being powered at any one time. Thus, each trnnsmission from a particular transmitter might be caused to be less than one tenth second in length. The total number of transmitters employed in a monitoring system will determine the time needed between transmissions from the same transmitter in order to decrease the probability of over lapping signals. Should overlapping occur, the receiver at the central control station may simply be caused to wait until a next succeeding transmission to read the status. A physical layout of a monitoring arrangement in accordance with the present invention, utilizing an optical oil sensing cable, is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 indicates the convenient manner in which successive ones of the transmitting units 16 and interconnecting cables may be disposed along the expanse of pipeline network being monitored.A typical transmitting unit 16 is indicated in Figure 5 as being integral with a length of communication cable 14b and an associated optical oil sensing cable 18. Common communication cable expanse 14b may comprise a twisted line pair 14 surrounded by a shielded sleeve 60 carried within an outer impermeable covering 62 which may be foam filled. The optical oil sensing cable 18 carries an optical fiber loop 56 with the transmitter assembly 16 attached to the pipeline by means of a magnetic tape member 54 which is integrally affixed to the oil sensing cable 18 and the communications cable section 14b. The optical oil sensing cable, as best depicted in Figure 6 andFigure 7, consists of an optical fixer loop 56 carried between two corrugated strip members 66 and 68 which are coextensive with the optical fiber loop. The optical fIber loop 56 and corrugated strips 66 and 63 are surrounded by oleophil4c material 64 all contained in a porous hydrophobic sleeve 58. When an oil leak occurs, the oil is absorbed into the cable throngh porous holes by the oleophilic material. This material expands when the oli is absorbed, forcing the two corrugated strips against the optical fiber loop 56 causing the optical fiber to bend into the corrugated pattern defined by strips 66 and 68.Thus, microbending is imparted to the optical fiber loop and the optical attenuation of the optical fiber 56 is increased, with an attendant reduction in light output from the loop as it is applied back to the optical electronics in the transmitter assembly 16. As depicted in Figure 6, the optical oil sensing cable 18 is shown in integral relationship with the magnetic tape mounting member 54 and the common communications cable 14. Each transmitting assembly 16 may be fitted with a cable connector 60 by means of which the twistedpair wires comprising common communications cable 14 may be connected to a mating connector 63 which terminates an adjacent section of cable 14 which connects to a preceeding transmitter unit 16. Figure 5 further illustrates a plurality of sealed encoding switches 17 which might be associated with each transmitter unit 16 to facilitate selection of address and other encoding desired for each unit. It is contemplated that the oil sensing cable employing fiber optic loop 56 may be other than that described herein and depicted inFigure 6 and Figure 7. For example, although the described embodiment employs microbending for increasing attenuation characteristics, other principles associated with fiber optics technology might be employed as well. For example, it is known that optical fibers exhibit attenuation characteristics depending upon the difference between the index of refraction of the glass fiber and the media surrounding the glass fiber, such that other techniques might be employed to utilize increased attenuation characteristics to sense the presence of oil along the optical fiber loop. The system described is seen to provide a monitoring means for detecting fault conditions along the expanse of a pipeline network which provides for fault annunciation, fault location data, and inherently provides a self test feature. Since the plural transmitters are caused to transmit intermittently whether a fault is sensed by an associated sensor or not, when a transmission has not been received from a particular transmitter during a period of time exceeding a normal cycle time, it is evident there is a problem existing with that transmitter. In addition, if no transmission has been received from transmitters beyond a certain point in the pipeline metwork, it is evident that there is a break in the common communications cable beyond that point. Although the present invention bas been described with respect to a particular embodiment thereof, it is not to be so limited, as changes might be made therein which fall within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.
