## Description
The present invention relates to a loop transmission system having transmission stations connected by a loop transmission line and is particularly applicable to a loop transmission system suitable for a digital integrated ring network in which data terminals and non data terminals can coexist as data processors connected with the transmission stations. Typical prior art technique for a digital integrated ring network, is described in papers such as C C NET LOOP 6830 Universal Link System NEC Technical Report Vol. 36, No. 7 1983 Ito et al., pp. 32 to 38. In the transmission system disclosed in this report, the circuit exchange function is realized by a plurality of time sharing time slots. This requires a number of the aforementioned time slots, when a large volume of traffic such as digitized animation data is to be processed as the transfer data, and the amount of network simultaneous storage is severely limited. For ring network topology, there exists a system employing a star network in which the respective relay lines are concentracted at one place, as is disclosed in A Local Communications Network Based on Inter connected Token Access Rings A Tutorial IBM J. RES. DEVELOP Vol. 27, No. 5, 1983 C. Strole pp. 481 to 496. However, this system aims at improving its reliability, and the circuit change over means called a wiring concentrator has only its construction and operation disclosed to bypass a malfunctioning station but does not at all improve its transmission performance. US A 4,393,497 discloses a loop transmission system with the features set forth in the first part of claim 1. In the known system, switching over of the connection relationship between the stations is controlled by a switching control connected to each station by an individual control line. EP A 0 099 978 describes a transmission system in which a plurality of transmission stations are connected to a concentrator which is adapted to establish loop, star or multidrop network configurations. A switch controller is provided for sequentially interrogating all stations and for controlling the switching means in accordance with request signals received from the stations. SE B 435 987 discloses a further loop transmission system capable of network reconfiguration in accordance with station requests. An object of the present invention is to provide a loop transmission system having a variable station order, which can multiplex and store the traffic necessary for the high speed transfer of a large volume of data such as a digital animation images in a loop network. According to the present invention, the relay lines of a loop network are concentrated in one place, where the order of connection of transmission stations is changed in accordance with a transfer requirement, by noting that the circuit exchange is suitable for data which is to stored for a long, but must be instantly retrievable, whereas the packet exchange by the loop network is suitable for the other data so that the combination of the two makes it possible to multiplex data having different traffic characteristics on one transmission line and that the loop network is characterized by making simultaneous transmissions of plural stations for the same time period if the receiving station for receiving the data is positioned downstream of and adjacent to the sending station for sending said data. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 are diagrams showing the construction of the loop transmission system having the variable connection order and expressing the characteristics of the present invention Fig. 4 is a transmission time chart and a format diagram Fig. 5 is a diagram showing the structure of the connection order change over means Fig. 6 is a diagram showing the structure of the change over control means Fig. 7 is a diagram showing the structure of the transmission station Figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11 are flow charts showing the operations of the respective portions of the time slot multiplex control unit Fig. 12 is a data transfer flow between the adaptors Fig. 13 is a diagram showing one embodiment of the adaptor 151 of Fig. 7 Fig. 14 is a schematic diagram for explaining the operations and Fig. 15 is a schematic diagram of the station order change over. The present invention will be described in connection with one embodiment thereof with reference to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows an example of the overall structure of a loop network to which the present invention is applied. As shown, a variety of data processors 11 to 18 such as computers or terminals, which are discretely installed in factories, buildings and universities, participate one loop transmission system through transmission stations 21 to 24, respectively, to transfer data among themselves. Here, each transfer station is constructed of a transmitter T 2127, 2227, 2327 or 2427, a receiver R 2111, 2211, 2311 or 2411, a time slot multiplex control unit 211, 221, 231 or 241, and an equipment adaptor 131 to 134, 141 to 144, or 151. The transmission stations are connected in a loop by bit serial transmission lines 3, and these relay lines are temporarily concentrated at a concentrator 4 called a stream changer to form a star network. Here, the stream changer is constructed of transmitters 451 to 454, receivers 411 to 414, change over means 41 and changeover control means 42. As shown, the judgement as to how to make the connection order is conducted by an equipment adaptor ADP 151 of the transmission station 21, and its instruction is delivered to the change over means CTL 42. The shown connection order is the transmission stations 21, 22, 23 and 24, as indicated by the broken lines in the change over control means 41. The Figure shows the example in which the transmission stations are four in number and are respectively connected with two data processors. Despite this, however, the present invention does not aim to limit the numbers of the stations and the processors. These respective components will be described sequentially in the following. Now, the data processors to be connected with the transmission stations are classified into the following two kinds from their transferring traffic characteristics In the structural example of Fig. 1, the equipment of the type 1 is exemplified by the ITV camera 12 and the image processor 15 and by the color still image filer 14 and the image retrieving terminal 17, whereas the equipment of type 2 is exemplified by the computers 11 and 13 and their data processing terminals 16 and 18. In the system shown, moreover, those data having different traffic characteristics can coexist on the same tranmission line. Generally speaking, it is well known in the art that the circuit exchange is suitable for the former data whereas the packet exchange is suitable for the latter data. In order to realize this, according to the present invention, the connection order in the stream changer 4 is controlled such that the transmission station 23 connected with the image processor 15 is located just downstream of the transmission station 21 accommodating the ITV camera 12, and such that the transmission station 24 connected with the image locating terminal 17 is located downstream of the transmission station 22 accommodating the image filer 14 acting as the sender. Now, the description referring to Fig. 1 is directed to the case in which the stream changer is one having the star network shape in the system, but the transmission system according to the present invention should not be limited thereto. More specifically, Fig. 2 shows an example of a discrete star network configuration which is composed of a plurality of stream changers. For simplicity of illustration, incidentally, components other than the transmission stations, the stream changers and the transmission lines are not shown. The present shape is advantageous in that it is possible to shorten the transmission line length and to limit the number Of transmissions stations connected with the stream changers, when the scale of the system applied is so large that the system has more transmission stations and a larger distance between the transmission stations than those of the system of Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows an example in which the ring network is constructed in a mesh configuration. This case can better withstand the obstruction to transmission because a portion of the line joining the stream changers, i.e., the line portion between SC₁ and SC₄ in this example can be constructed so as to be a redundant preparatory line. In order to explain the operations of the respective portions according to the transmission system of the present invention, an example of the transmission time chart is shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the present example corresponds to the case in which the following traffic occurs simultaneously in the system structure of Fig. 1 The transmission line is constructed of a repetition of a plurality of e.g., five in this example time sharing time slots, and this repeating unit is called the frame . The frame synchronism for recognizing the order of the time slot is achieved by detecting a frame synchronism character SYN. The structure of the present character can be realized by various methods such as the unique bit pattern or the code violation, but details are omitted here. The respective time slots have the common structure of a fixed length and are composed of three characters a time slot control character C as header data a destination address character DA for designating a receiving transmission station and equipment and a data length character LNG indicating the effective data length in the time slot. The portion in the time slot other than the header data is stored with the data DATA resulting from the free format for each device. The time slot control C contains, as shown, an F B bit expressing the occupation state of said time slot, and a P C bit for discriminating whether said time slot is used for the data transfer of the aforementioned type 1 or 2. In the present Figure the aforementioned traffic iii is processed by using the time slot TS₁ the traffic iv by the time slot TS₂ the traffic i by the time slots TS₄ and TS₅ and the traffic ii by the time slot TS₄. Here, it should be noted that some time slots are used exclusively by some station for the data of the traffic type 1 in one frame whereas other time slots are used commonly by a plurality of stations for the data of type 2. This indicates that the present system can simultaneously process data transfer of type 2 traffic. Next, specific embodiments of the respective components for realizing a transmission system according to the present invention will be described in the following. First of all, the hardware structure of the stream changer 4 will be described with reference to Fig. 5. The present changer 4 is constructed basically of change over means 41 and change over control means 42 for controlling the former, as has been described hereinbefore. Moreover, the present embodiment requires signal transmitting and receiving units because it is an active transmission line. The receivers 411 to 414 have their inputs permanently connected to the transmission stations, respectively, to have functions of signal amplification, waveform equalization and so on. Bit synchronizers PLL 431 to 434 extract timing data RTIM from the signal received. Timing converters TC 421 to 424 are composed mainly of FIFO i.e., First in First Out registers to absorb the phase differences and fluctuations between the sending and receiving timing. A sending clock STIM is supplied from an oscillator OSC 44. The change over means 41 is composed of multiplexers MPX 541 to 544 because the data flow may be unidirectional. All the input signals to said multiplexers are identical and the outputs of the timing converters TC 421 to 424. The respective selection signals MSEL₁ to MSEL₄ are supplied from the change over controller CTL . The transmitters SCT 451 to 454 are used to re transmit the outputs of the multiplexers MPX 541 to 544 to the lines and are permanently connected to the respective transmission stations like the receivers. Fig. 6 shows the detailed structure of the change over control means CTL 42. This means is constructed such that it can change the connection order of the transmission stations by the following Next, the hardware structure of the transmission station is shown in Fig. 7. Here is shown an example of the transmission station 21 because all the transmission stations have the same structure. In the system, only one station concurrently operates as the transmission control station. Here, the transmission control station performs those functions necessary to generate and monitor the frame signals and to compensate for the loop rounding delay. A receiver STR 2111, a timing converter TC 2113 and a transmitter STT 2127 are made to have the same functions as those used in the stream changer shown in Fig. 5, and their repeated explanations are avoided. As another components, a frame round controller FC 2114 adjusts the loop rounding delay time of the signal so that an integral number frames are present in one frame, and is composed of components such as a two port memory and an input output timing controller. A time slot header controller THC 2115 executes the monitor and write of the F B bit and the P C of the time slot header unit, as has been described in Fig. 4. A multiplexer MPX 2116 executes the change over between the relay data and the data sent from a self station as the data sent from the sending station. A demodulator DEM 2118 converts the Manchester coded signal on the transmission line to an NRZ i.e., No. Return to Zero data. The frame synchronism signal SYN shown in Fig. 4 can be detected by the present circuit if it is composed of a code violation. A modulator MOD 2126 executes the inverse conversion. A serial parallel converter S P 2119 and a parallel serial converter P S 2125 are constructed of shift registers, respectively. Buffer registers BUF 2120 and 2124 are buffer registers connected between a connector interface data bus and a transmission control. A time slot controller TSC 2122 counts and generates the timing for the time slot recognition and is composed mainly of a counter. The initialization of the counter is effected by detecting the frame synchronism from the demodulator DEM 2118. A received data transfer controller RTC 2121 supplies timing for transferring the data of the time slot addressed to the self station to connecting equipment. A sent data transfer controller STC 2123 executes various kinds of controls for capturing and transferring the corresponding time slot of the data sent out from the connection equipment. The sent data is taken from the transmission line 3 into the receiver STR 2111 and is sent out again to the transmission line 3 via the timing converter TC 2113, the frame rounding controller FC 2114, the time slot header controller THC 2115, the multiplexer MPX 2116, and a sender STT 2127. Simultaneously with this, the output of the frame rounding controller FC 2114 is also fed to the demodulator DEM 2118 and is therefore transferred via the series parallel converter S P 2119 and, in the case of the data assigned to the self station, further via the buffer register BUF 2120, a connection equipment interface data bus INBUS and the adaptors 131, 141 and 151 to the connection devices 11, 12 and 4. Conversely, data sent from the connecting devices 11 and 12 are sent out via the adaptors 131 and 141, a connection equipment interface data bus OUTBUS, the buffer register BUF 2124, the parallel series converter P S 2125, the modulator MOD 2126, the multiplexer MPS 2126 and the sender STT 2127 to the transmission line 3. The operations of the present transmission station will be described in more detail with reference to the processing flow charts shown in Figs. 8 to 11. Fig. 8 shows the initialization processing flow up to the establishment of the frame synchronism in case the present transmission station operates as the transmission control station. Moreover, this will explain the operations of the frame rounding controller 2124 and the timing converter 2113. First of all, the multiplexer 2116 is set at side B to start the sending operation of dummy data and to confirm that it rounds the loop. The establishment of the next timing conversion is realized by using the received clock pulse as the input timing of the FIFO register and by using the sent clock pulse as the output timing of the FIFO register after the storage of predetermined bit data has been completed a predetermined time interval later. In accordance with this stored bit data, the phase difference and fluctuations of the clock pulse which was sent and the one which was received are absorbed. When the loop rounding reproduction of said dummy data becomes possible, the modulator MOD 2126 is instructed to send out the frame synchronism character SYN. After this, simultaneously as the dummy data is sent out, the frame rounding controller FC 2114 is instructed to start its operation. In response to this instruction, the frame rounding controller FC 2114 starts storage of the data received subsequently, when the loop rounding of the frame synchronism character SYN is detected, and then starts to take out in the order of receipt the data exclusively stored until then, when the end of the frame is detected. As a result, the aforementioned delay can be compensated. After establishment of the delay of one round, the multiplexer MPX 2116 is switched to side A to start the relay of the data which is read out from the frame rounding controller 2114. At this time, the header of each time slot in the frame is initialized so that each transmission station can perform its sending operation. When the present transmission its sending operation. When the present transmission station operates as an ordinary transmission station, the initialization may simply await the establishment of bit synchronism and frame synchronism, while the multiplexer 2116 is left at side A without any data storage in the frame rounding controller FC 2114. Fig. 9 not only shows the processing flow of the receiving operation at each transmission station and but also explains the operation of a received data transfer controller RTC 2121. The data received after establishment of the frame synchronism is introduced via the demodulator DEM 2118 and the series parallel converter P S 2119 into the received data transfer controller RTC 2121. This received data transfer controller RTC 2121 checks and stores the designated address character DA and the data length character LNG in response to the signal coming from the time slot controller TSC 2122, indicating that the time slot header data is present. When case the address is designated to the self station, the corresponding adaptor is instructed to take in the content of the buffer register BUF 2120. How many bytes are to be transferred depends on the data length character stored in advance. Fig. 10 shows the data sending processing flow of packet change over type. With reference to this Fig. 10 and subsequent Fig. 11, detailed description will be based mainly upon the operations of the sent data transfer controller STC 2123 and the time slot header controller THC 2115. For example, a request RQ₁ output from the connection equipment 11 for packet change over is sent via the adaptor ADP 131 to the send data transfer circuit STC 2123. Here, what equipment the request comes from is determined and informed this information is passed to the time slot header controller THC 2115. The time slot header controller THC 2115 checks the F B bit of said time slot in response to the time slot header detection signal from the time slot controller 2122. If F free , this is rewritten to B busy and informed to the sent data transfer circuit STC 2123. This sent data transfer circuit STC 2123 instructs an adaptor ADP 131 to transfer the data and the multiplexer MPX 2116 to select the B side thereby to perform the sending operation. The time slot number used at this time is read in and stored by the time slot controller TSC 2122. When a sending operation of one or more time slots is desired, it is necessary to await one cycle of the same time slot of the next frame. When sending is complete, the busy bit of said time slot is rewritten to the free one. Fig. 11 shows the data sending processing flow of circuit exchange type. For example, a data sending request RQ₂ of circuit exchange type sent out from the connection equipment is sent via the adaptor ADP 141 to the sent data transfer circuit STC 2123. Here, what equipment made the request is determined and that information is given to the time slot header controller THC 2115. In the present embodiment, when the time slot used is of the circuit exchange type, as shown in Fig. 4, its range is determined in advance. On the basis of the time slot number informed by the time slot controller TSC 2122, the time slot header controller THC 2115 checks the P C bit of the corresponding time slot to examine whether it has already been used for the circuit exchange. If that bit is used for the packet exchange, the system waits for said time slot until it is free. When the time slot is free, it is rewritten to the busy state. Simultaneously with this, the use of the circuit exchange is written in the P C bit. This busy state is repeated by the number of the time slots required by said equipment 12. When all the busy states are ended, moreover, data transfer is executed such that the sent data transfer controller STC 2123 sends the adaptor ADP 141 with a read strobe signal WSTB and such that the multiplexer MPX 2116 is set at the B side. Once data transfer of the circuit exchange type is started, the same time slot cannot be used by the packet exchange type equipment because the F B bit of the time slot header remains busy. When the end of the communication is desired, the P C bit of the time slot header is rewritten from circuit exchange use to packet exchange use. If a check of the same bit after one loop cycle reveals that it is unchanged, the F B bit is changed to be free because other transmission stations do not use said time slot. If said bit is rewritten to the circuit exchange use after one loop round, the transmission is terminated without any operation because the other transmission stations still use the same. When no request for data transfer of circuit exchange type is made, said time slot can be used for data transfer of the packet exchange type by the control thus far described so that the transmission lines can be used more effectively. Next, the connection order change over at the stream changer 4 will be described in the following. This change over method can be first divided roughly into the following two Since a further description of the method 1 is unnecessary, the method 2 will be described hereinafter. The realization of the method 2 is further classified, as follows The latter is further deivided into the following two methods in accordance with how to send the instruction. The quantity of the hardware required of the stream changer is the most for the system 1 and can be minimized for the system 2 2 b . No matter what method might be adopted, the procedures of the control are basically identical, and the system 2 2 b will be described in connection with the following embodiment. First of all, the summary of the operations will be explained with reference to the time chart of Fig. 12. In this Figure, all three adaptors are shown the respective adaptors 141 and 133 for connecting the sending and receiving equipment with the time slot multiplex controlling unit and the SC adaptor 151 for connecting the stream changer. The time lapse is shown downward of the drawing. The transmitting procedures are Fig. 13 shows the hardware structure of the aforementioned SC adaptor 151. This is a device for setting the transmission station connection order for the stream changer 4 from the outside and is constructed of the following components The processor 1512 is composed primarily of a microprocessor MPU 1521, an interruption controller PIC 5122, a high speed memory transfer controller DMAC 1523, a timer controller PTM 1524, a program memory ROM 1520. The change over demand to be transferred from the time slot multiplex control unit TMP 211 is introduced into the FIFO memory 1531 in the transmission interface circuit SBIC 1511 and is then written in the memory RAM 1514 by the high speed memory transfer controller DMAC 1523 until it is judged by the microprocessor MPU 1521. The answer to the change over demand and the instructions to interrupt and reopen sending are stored in memory from the microprocessor MPU 1521 and are then stored in the FIFO register 1530 in the transmission interface circuit SBIC 1511 by the high speed memory transfer controller DMAC 1523 until they are sent out to the time slot multiplex control unit. On the other hand, the same are written directly in the change over control means 42 in the stream changer 4 from the microprocessor MPU 1521 via the instruction interface circuit SCIC 1513. The procedures in which the SC adaptor 151 changes the stream changer 4 will be described in more detail with reference to the schematic diagram of Fig. 14. In this example, it is assumed that there are four transmission stations and that the immediate connection order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, and so on, as shown in a memory RAM 1525 in the SC adaptor 151. Here, the leading address of the present table is indicated at SOTTA, and the number of steps from that address indicates the connection order. Now, it is assumed that the transmission station 1 receives a change over instruction to the transmission line 3. At this time, the processor prepares the instruction to set the two buffer registers 4211 and 4212 in the change over control means 42 of the stream changer 4 by the instant transmission station connection order tables SOTTA 3 in the following manner. The instruction to be stored in the register 4211 is composed of the following three words having a memory address RESTA as a header The instruction to be stored in the register 4212 is composed of the following three words having a memory address SEITA as a header After this, the instant transmission station connection order table is renewed. The procedures are followed by temporarily retracting the receiving station address 3 in a memory address TEMPA and by incrementing by one word all the memory contents from the memory address SOTTA 1 stored with the sending just downstream station address 2 to the memory address SOTTA 2 stored with the receiving station address 3 . Then, the address SOTTA 1 has its content lost, and the address SOTTA 2 is entered by 2. After this, the content 3 retracted temporarily in the TEMPA is transferred to the memory address SOTTA 1 in which the sending just downstream station address has been present before. As a result, the order of connection of the transmission stations is 1, 3, 2, 4 and 1. This order is sent to the display DISP 150. For the change over control means 42, the content from the memory address RESTA may be transferred to the buffer register 4211, and the content from the memory address SEITA may be transferred to the buffer register 4212. Fig. 15 shows how the order of connection of the transmission stations is caused to change by the aforementioned transfers. Fig. 15 a shows the mode before the change. The content of the memory address RESTA,is transferred to the buffer register 4211, and the content of the SEITA is transferred to the buffer register 4212 for writing as shown in Fig. 15 b . Like the above, Fig. 15 c is obtained if the content of the address RESTA 1 is transferred to the registers 4211 and 4212. Moreover, the final mode of Fig. 15 d is obtained if the content of the address RESTA 2 is transferred to the registers 4211 and 4212. Even when a large amount of traffic requiring a high speed transfer and large capacity such as the transmission of a digital animation image are generated in the system, according to the present invention, they can be accommodated by the circuit exchange using the same time slot. As a result, the transmission performance of the loop transmission system can be drastically improved.
