# An illumination device.

## Abstract
An illumination device for illuminating the interior of a room comprising an optical wave guide 1 for transmitting light rays and a convex Fresnel lens 2 for diffusing light rays emitted from an exit end of the optical wave guide. In order to obtain the most effective ilumination in the room, consideration should be given to the degree of diffusion, the range of illumination and the area, to be illuminated. For this purpose, according to the construction of the present invention, the distance between the convex Fresnel lens and the exit end of the optical wave guide can be adjusted within a range not longer than the focal length of the convex Fresnel lens. In addition, the convex Fresnel lens is constructed so as to be inclinable with respect to the stationary portion of said device.
