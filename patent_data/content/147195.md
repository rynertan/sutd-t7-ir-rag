# Optical switch.

## Abstract
An optical switch has waveguides 25 1, 25 2, 25 3, 25 4 on a semiconductor substrate 21 . The waveguides intersect at rhomboidal regions 27 1, 27 2, 27 3, 274 and stripe layers 22, 23 are formed along the longer diagonal of the rhomboidal regions. The carrier concentration of these stripe layers 22, 23 may be changed, by applying an appropriate voltage to electrodes 24 1, 24 2, 24 3, 24 4, 31 and this causes a change in the refraction index of the stripe layers 22, 23 and so causes reflection of light propagating in one waveguide into another waveguide. The substrate 21 , the waveguides 25 1, 25 2, 25 3, 25 4 , and the stripe layers 22 23 are each a compound semiconductor of the same semiconductor system, and the band gap of the stripe layers 22, 23 is equal or close to the wavelength of the light to be switched. Such an arrangement permits a relatively large angle between the intersecting waveguides 25 1, 25 2, 25 3, 25 4 and so permits the optical switch to be small.
