# Cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube comprising in an evacuated envelope 1 an electron gun system 5, 104 for generating at least one electron beam 6, 7, 8, 105 which is focused on a target 10, 108 by means of at least one accelerating electron lens 22, 23, 50, 51 which, viewed in the direction of propagation of the electron beam, comprises a first 22, 50 and a second 23, 51 electrode separated by a lens gap 30, 53 in which second electrode an electrically conductive foil or gauze 31, 52 which intersects the beam is provided at a distance from the lens gap. When in such a tube the foil or gauze is flat and is provided at such a location that it holds that 0.25
