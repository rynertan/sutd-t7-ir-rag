# Thermoformable composition containing a cross linked cyanurate polymer, and a process for producing same.

## Abstract
A composition is described, useful as a thermoformable polymer, for producing shaped articles having high yield and impact strengths, good heat resistance, and good solvent resistance. The composition, which is cured, contains a crosslinked polycyanurate network polymer in which a high molecular weight thermoplastic polymer, such as a polyestercarbonate, is finely dispersed. The composition possesses a Vicat softening temperature ASTM 1525 of at least about 10 C above that of said thermoplastic polymer alone, and an elongation at break value ASTM D 638, at room temperature at least twice that of said crosslinked polymer alone. Due to the high yield strength, lighter structural articles and components can be fabricated from the composition possessing high structural strength.
