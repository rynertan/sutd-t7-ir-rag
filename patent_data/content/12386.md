# A releasable locking device.

## Abstract
A device is provided for releasably securing a parked vehicle to an adjacent structure S . The device is provided with a first member 21 hingedly mounted for movement between an operative mode and an inoperative mode. When the first member 21 is in an operative mode the distal end thereof will releasably engage a portion of the parked vehi cle and retain same in a desired position relative to the adjacent structure S . When the first member 21 is in an inoperative mode, it assumes a vehicle release position. The first member 21 is provided with means 38 for moving same from the inoperative mode to the operative mode. A further means 80, 38 is provided for automatically locking the first member in an operative mode. The further means 10 includes a means for effecting controlled unlocking of the first member 21 whereby the latter will automatically return to its inoperative mode. The first member and asso ciated means 28 are mounted so as to move as a unit in a substantially vertical direction to compensate for dimen sional variations occurring in the various vehicles parked next to the adjacent structure.
