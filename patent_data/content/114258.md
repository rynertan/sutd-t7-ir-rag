## Description
Resin encapsulation type photo semiconductor devices BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a resin encapsulation type photo semiconductor device. More particularly, it relates to a resin encapsulation type photo semiconductor device for which employed is a photocurable epoxy resin composition having an improved curability and giving electric properties suitable for use as an insulating material, a resist material, etc. for a variety of electrical equipments. The above mentioned photo semiconductor device is wherein meant generically to be a light emitting device such as a light emitting diode, etc., a light detecting device or photoelectric transducer such as a CCD charge coupled device image sensor, a phototransistor, etc., or a composite device comprised of the light emitting device and the light detecting device, such as a photocoupler, etc. the f the above photo semiconductor devices include the light emitting device such as light ting diode and the other devices, which have been put to practical use for various kinds of indicators, have been manufactured by encapsulating a photo semiconductor element with a resin. When encapsulating the photo semiconductor element with a resin, epoxy resin series compositions which are excellent in an electrical property, a water resisting property and a heat resisting property have been used predominantly as encapsulation resins.Nonetheless, the encapsulation resins conventionally used, which are epoxy resin compositions of thermosetting type, have required ten hours or more to have cured. For this reason, encapsulation methods utilyzing such compositions have been disadvantageous in respect of the productivity.In recent years, photocurable epoxy resin type composition have been developed for the purpose of minimizing the curing time, saving the heat source and enhancing the prouctivity. Such resin,composition can be roughly classified into the following two types One is a composition obtained by modification of an epoxy resin with use of a vinyl group containing compound such as an acrylic ester having a photopolymerizability, which undergoes photopolymerization through the vinyl group.However, the modified epoxy resin is considerably inferior in the heat resisting property to the epoxy resin itself.The other is a composition obtained by curing the epoxy resin itself by use of a catalyst of a photodecomposable type. An example of the catalyst used therefor is a complex represented by the following formula EMI2.1 wherein Ar represents an aromatic group such as a phenyl group X represents an iodine atom, a sulfur atom, a diazo group, or the like and Y represents BF4, Pup 6, AsF6, SbF6 or the like , as disclosed in Macromoleculas, 10, 1307 1977 Journal of Radiation Curing, 5, 2 1978 Journal of Polymer Science Polymer ChemistryEdition, 17, 2877 1979 ditto, 17, 1047 1979 Journal of Polymer Science Polymer Letters Edition 17, 759 1979 Specification of Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication KOKAI No.65219 1980 specification of U.S.Patent No. 4,069,054 specification of British Patent No.1,516,511 specification of British Patent No. 1,518,141 etc.However, when an epoxy resin is cured by the aid of such a catalyst component, the cured product thus obtained has a good mechanical property and a heat resisting property, whereas the catalyst component remains as an ionic impurity. Therefore, it is feared that the deterioration of electrical insulating property and corrosion phenomenon occur when such a cured product is applied in an electrical equipment.Thus, the performance of a resultant photo semiconductor device itself has been liable to become inferior when a resin encapsulation type photo semiconductor device is manufactured by use of the conventional photocurable epoxy resin type composition.It is an object of this invention to provide a resin encapsulation type photo semiconductor device which may eliminate the above mentioned disadvantage in the prior art device and, at the same time, improve the productivity by employing a photocurable epoxy resin type composition being curable with irradiation of energy rays such as light, ultraviolet rays, X rays, gamma rays and electron beams, particularly with ultraviolet rays, and in a shorter time.As a result of intensive studies made by the present inventors, it was found that the above object can be achieved by using as photocuring catalysts an aluminum compound, and a silicon compound capable of forming a silanol group by irradiat n of energy rays herein meant to include the above mentioned light, ultraviolet rays,X rays, gamma rays, electron beams and the like , in combination with the epoxy resin, and optionally by using further a photosensitizer. The invention has thus accomplished.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe resin encapsulation type photo semiconductor device according to this invention is characterized by comprising a photo semiconductor element therein meant to include a light emitting elemenet or a light detecting element to be used correspondingly in the aforementioned light emitting divice or light detecting device encapsulated with a photopolymerizable composition comprising a an epoxy resin b an aluminum compound, and c a silicon compound capable of forming a silanol group by irradiation with energy rays.In this invention, the silicon compound as defined in the above c is meant to be i a silicon compound having a peroxysilyl group, ii a silicon compound having an a ketosilyl group or iii a silicon compound having an o nitrobenzyloxy grou Moreover, the photopolymerizable composition I invention may further contain a photosensitizer.

Employed as light source were two sets of high pressure mercury vapor lamps of 2 KW each, and irradiation was made at a position 10 cm distant from the light source. Resin encapsulation type phototransistors thus manufactured were subjected to tests allowing them to stand at high temperature and high humidity in an atmosphere of 850C and 85 RH, while applying inverse bias voltage of 10 V with lapse of time to measure dark current.

The devices thus manufactured are free from undesirable color changes since the epoxy resin compositions are not colored by the catalytic component. They are also excellent in water resistance and heat resistance. Moreover, because of the materials curable in a shorter time, energy can be saved and the productivity can be enhanced, thereby producing greater industrial values..
