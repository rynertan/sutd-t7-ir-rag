## Description
This invention relates to processes for production of human insulin like growth factor I hereinafter referred to as IGF I , to IGF I fused to a protective peptide hereinafter referred to as fused IGF I , to a gene coding for fused IGF I, to a plasmid containing fused IGF I gene, to a host organism containing plasmid containing fused IGF I gene, and to processes for the production thereof. Meanwhile, human insulin like growth factor I is a protein hormone synthesized mainly in human tissues, liver and kidney which are stimulated by a certain hormone, and is found in human serum. IGF I is known to have insulin like potency and stimulation potency of sulfate uptake by cartilage and may enhance protein and DNA synthesis in a cell. Therefore, it is useful in promoter of growth and may be useful in clinical treatment of diabetes. IGF I is excreted in small amounts in human serum and may be isolated only few mg from human serum of several tons. Additionally, the producing cell of IGF I was isolated in pure form, and it was found that IGF I had biological properties as mentioned above, and its amino acid sequence has been reported in the literature. There exists, however, a need for a more viable commercial production of IGF I, and such a requirement stimulate the accomplishment of this invention. It was perceived that the application of recombinant DNA and associated technologies would be the most effective way of producing large quantities of IGF I. Therefore, the present invention is directed to a process for the production of IGF I, which comprises subjecting IGF I fused to a protection peptide to elimination reaction in which to IGF I fused to a protective peptide, wherein the protective peptide is a protein peptide having methionine as the last amino acid and is fused to IGF I through said methionine, IGF I is known to consist of 70 amino acids in the following sequence The inventors of this invention succeeded in producing a large amount of IGF I by using the following essential steps. A process for the production of a gene coding for IGF I. This process is optionally followed by a process for the production of fused IGF I gene, i.e. a gene coding for IGF I fused with a protective peptide which comprises linking a gene coding for a protective peptide with IGF I gene with or without a linker upstream of said IGF I gene. Suitable linker may include a gene coding for several amino acids and having a suitable restriction enzyme recognition sites to link a protective peptide upstream of IGF I gene, and the linker The most suitable linker is the ones as exemplified hereinafter. Suitable fused IGF I, i.e. IGF I fused with a protective peptide is the ones as illustrated and exemplified hereinafter in the Examples. A process for the production of an expression vector which comprises inserting a promoter gene and a gene coding for fused IGF I into a plasmid. The most suitable expression vector is plasmid pSdM1 322trp and pLHSdMmtrp, A process for the production of a transformant which comprises transforming a host organism with said expression vector. Suitable host organism is A process for the production of fused IGF I which comprises culturing said transformant in a suitable medium. A process for isolation of fused IGF I from host organism cells. A process for the production of IGF I which comprises subjecting said fused IGF I to elimination reaction of the protective peptide. The protective peptide in the term fused IGF I, i.e. IGF I fused with a protective peptide is used for protecting IGF I from degradation by protease in the cells of a host organism, and is removed by elimination reaction of said fused IGF I. Namely, said fused IGF I is an intermediate for preparing IGF I by elimination reaction, so said protective peptide can be any eliminable protective peptide derived from natural or synthetic protein, natural or synthetic peptide, or a fragment thereof. Suitable fused IGF I is IGF I fused with a protein peptide through methionine of the protein peptide. Suitable agent used in this elimination reaction is cyanogen bromide The present elimination reaction can be conducted under mild conditions in a conventional solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction. From the above amino acid sequence of IGF I, a corresponding nucleotide sequence has been invented, subject to a number of specific non obvious criteria. The IGF I gene has been cloned by inserting it into a known plasmid, as a cloning vector. The IGF I gene has been excised from the recombinant plasmid, and then inserted into a plasmid specifically designed to maximize expression of the IGF I gene under the control of a promoter. A structural gene coding for a protective peptide is inserted into the recombinant plasmid upstream of and adjacent to said IGF I gene. The present invention is illustrated in detail hereinafter. To obtain fused IGF I from a host organism, a promoter gene was designed. A promoter gene obtained by such a criteria is inserted into a plasmid in a style that the promoter gene is located upstream of and adjacent to a gene coding for IGF I or fused IGF I. As a suitable embodiment of this invention a synthetic trp promoter I gene or synthetic trp promoter II gene were prepared. As a suitable example of a protective peptide which can be fused with IGF I, protein peptide LH has been prepared. IGF I gene is inserted to a plasmid containing a promoter gene, and IGF I gene is transformed into a host organism. As a suitable embodiment of this invention, the following recombinant plasmids were established to express IGF I gene in Maxam Gilbert method can be used. A gene coding for fused IGF I which comprises linking a gene coding for a protective peptide with IGF I gene with or without a linker upstream of the IGF I gene was preapred. In this process, the following type of protein peptides is fused with IGF I. Type I a protein peptide having methionine as the last amino acid Type I IGF I fused with the protein peptide through methionine of the protein peptide As a suitable embodiment of this invention, the following type of expression vector of a gene coding for IGF I fused with protein peptide LH is prepared. The present invention also relates to a process for the invention of such a gene which is constructed by linking a gene coding for a protective peptide with the IGF I gene upstream of said IGF I gene with or without a linker. For the expression of the IGF I gene, thus obtained plasmid having a promoter gene and IGF I gene is transformed into a host organism, and then the host organism having the plasmid is the cultured in nutrient medium containing sources of assimilable carbon and nitrogen under aerobic conditions e. g. shaking culture, submerged culture, etc. . The preferred sources of carbon in the nutrient medium are carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, glycerin, starch and the like. Other sources which may be included are xylose, galactose, maltose, dextrin, lactose and the like. The preferred sources of nitrogen are yeast extract, peptone, gulten meal, cottonseed flour, soybean meal, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, wheat germ, etc., as well as inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds such as ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, etc. , urea, amino acid and the like. The carbon and nitrogen sources, though advantageously employed in combination, need not be used in their pure form, because less pure materials which contain traces of growth factors and considerable quantities of mineral nutrients, are also suitable for use. When desired, there may be added to the medium mineral salts such as calcium carbonate, sodium or potassium phosphate, sodium or potassium chloride, magnesium salts, copper salts and the like. Agitation and aeration of the culture mixture may be accomplished in a variety of ways. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the fermentor, by various pumping equipment or by the passage of sterile air through the medium. Agitation may be effected by passing sterile air through the fermantition mixture. The fermentation is usually conducted at a temperature between about 20 C and 42 C, preferably 35 38 C, for a period of several hours to 50 hours. Thus produced IGF I or fused IGF I can be recovered from the cultured medium by conventional means which are commonly used for the recovery of other known biologically active substances. In general, IGF I or fused IGF I produced are found in the cells of host organisms, and accordingly IGF I or fused IGF I can be separated from the cells, which is obtained by filtering or centrifuging the cultured broth, by a conventional method such as concentration under reduced pressure, lysis such as sonication, HPLC, lyophilization, pH adjustment, treatment with resin e.g. anion or cation exchange resin, non ionic adsorption resin , treatment with a conventional adsorbent e.g. activated carbon, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, almina , gel filtration, crystallization, and the like. Thus obtained fused IGF I can be converted to IGF I by elimination reaction of the protective peptide. This elimination reaction can be conducted in accordance with a conventional method used in the field of peptide chemistry. Suitable elimination reaction can be selected according to the type of fused IGF I. Suitable agent used in this elimination reaction is cyanogen bromide The reaction temperature is not critical and the reaction is usually conducted from cooling to warming. The elimination reaction which can be applied to the type of fused IGF I is hereinafter described in detail. RIA of IGF I was followed the method established by N. Yanaihara N.
