## Description
PROCESS FOR FLUORINATING CHLOROFLUORO TELOMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved process and catalyst system for fluorinating chlorofluoro telomers, and particularly telomers of chlorotrifluoroethylene, hereinafter designated as CTFE , to produce highly fluorinated, stable products for use as industrial fluids, oils and greases.For convenience, the present invention will be more particularly illustrated in this disclosure in terms of telomers prepared from CTFE monomer, although it should be readily understood that the principles and techniques embodied herein are applicable to a wide variety of other chlorofluoro telomers as well. Telomers of CTFE are saturated low molecular weight polymers, typically having a molecular number n the number of repeating units in the telomer chain in the range of 1 to 20, and can be formed by the addition polymerization reaction ofCTFE with carbon tetrachloride in a solvent, such as acetonitrile, and in the presence of suitable polymerization catalysts, such as ferric chloride and benzoin. After fluorination, such telomers have a variety of practical uses as lubricants, hydraulic fluids, sealants, heat exchange fluids, and the like. Various methods for preparing CTFE telomers are known in the prior art and have been practiced commercially for many years. An article by William T. Miller, Jr. et al inIndustrial and Engineering Chemistry, pages 333 337 1947 , entitled Low Polymers of Chlorotrifluoroethylene , describes a process for producing low molecular weight polymers of CTFE by carrying out the polymerization in a solution of chloroform using benzoyl peroxide as a polymerization promoter. Other solvents disclosed in the reference as being useful for this purpose include carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethylene.The solution is heated in a pressure vessel for 1 3 4 hours at lOO0C, and the unreacted GTFE monomer and chloroform are removed by distillation, leaving a crude telomer of general formula CHC12 CF2CClF nCl, which can be further heated and distilled to yield products ranging from a light oil to a semisolid wax or grease. U. S. Patent 2,793,201, issued May 21, 1957, discloses improved promoters for polymer king CTFE monomer to produce low molecular weight polymers. Specific promoters disclosed in the reference include various peroxides such as bis trichioroacetyl peroxide and bis perchloroacrylyl peroxide.The use of such promoters produces a more stable polymer by eliminating the amount of reactive hydrogen present in the polymer. Another process which has been developed for producing low molecular weight CTFE polymers is described in U. S.Patent 2,788,375, issued April 9, 1957. This process comprises reacting CTFE with a saturated organic bromo compound, such as bromotrichloromethane, in the presence of actinic light in a de oxygenated system to obtain saturated bromopolychlorotrifluoro compounds containing one or more CTFE units per molecule. These saturated bromopolychlorofluoro compounds can then be converted to corresponding polychlorofluoro compounds by treatment with chlorine, and subsequently fluorinated with common fluorinating agents such as cobalt trifluoride, manganese tetrafluoride, silver difluoride, and hydrogen fluoride, in combination with antimony catalysts, to yield more highly fluorinated products. A more recent development in this field is described in a series of articles by Y. Pietrasanta et al entitled Telomerization by Redox Catalysis appearing in the European Polymer Journal, Vol. 12 1976 . This technology involves the reaction of a chlorinated telogen, such as carbon tetrachloride, withCTFE in the presence of benzoin and a suitable redox catalyst, such as ferric chloride hexahydrate FeC13.6H20 . The telomerization reaction is suitably carried out in acetonitrile which is a common solvent for the reactants and catalysts. The redox method derives its name from the catalytic activity of the ferric ion during the telomerization reaction which is reduced as it caps the telomer with a chloride ion and is alternately oxidized as it initiates chain growth of the telomer. The various telomerization processes described above generally result in the preparation of a crude telomer having the general formula CC13 CF2CClF nCl, where n is typically in the range of from above 1 to about 20. It is known that such crude telomers can be stabilized by fluorination using suitable fluorinating agents. The expression stabilized as used herein denotes the replacement of one or more of the chlorine atoms with fluorine in the terminal group s of the telomer chain, and the saturation of various olefinic impurities generated during the telomerization reaction and which remain dissolved in the telomers. The telomers produced by such fluorination are highly stable in corrosive environments and are essentially non flammable in oxidizing atmospheres. It is known in the prior art that telomers of CTFE can be fluorinated using a variety of fluorinating agents. Thus, the use of cobalt trifluoride for this purpose is discussed in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, supra, wherein the crude CTFE telomer is reacted with successive portions ofCoF3 at temperatures up to about 2000C until a total weight of CoF3 approximating the weight of polymer has been added.During the reaction, fluorine is consumed by replacement reaction and the CoF3 salt is converted to CoF2. The stabilized reaction product is then extracted from the spent salt with carbon tetrachlortde, filtered, and distilled to remove the carbon tetrachloride. The residue is further vacuum distilled to obtain a stabilized oil fraction as the finished polymer. A variety of other fluorinating agents are also disclosed in the prior art. For instance, U. S. Patent 2,886,607 illustrates the use of antimony trifluoride in combination with antimony pentachioride to fluorinate various telomers of perchl orofl uorool efins, such as chlorotrifluoroethylene. A series of patents assigned to the M. W. Kellogg Company,British Patents 712,184 and 761,053, and U. S. Patent 2,636,908, are directed to the polymerization, cracking and subsequent fluorination of CTFE. Both of the aforementioned British Patents describe the polymerization and subsequent cracking of CTFE to produce oils of various molecular weights and boiling ranges, and the subsequent stabilization of the oils by fluorination with, in succession, chlorine trifluoride followed by cobalt trl fluoride as fluorinating agents U. S. Patent 2,636,908 describes similar polymerization and cracking procedures to produce CTFE oils, and the postchlorination and fluorination of these oils to produce a fully stabilized product. The post fluorination step is carried out using chlorine trifluoride or hydrofluoric acid as a fluorinating agent at temperatures ranging from about 1000C to about 3000C. The use of a catalyst or promoting agent for the fluorination process, such as cobalt trifluoride, is also disclosed. The demand for chlorofluorinated lubricants such as those described herein has grown steadily in recent years due, in part, to an increase in applications where the flammability of exist ing products, such as hydraulic fluids presents a potential safety hazard. It will therefore be readily appreciated that a continuing and growing need exists for improvements in existing processes which will provide for the more efficient and less expensive manufacture of these products on an industrial scale. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, an improved process for stabilizing telomers of chlorotrifluoroethylene comprises reacting the crude telomer with a fluorinating agent in the presence of a catalytic amount of a fluorination catalyst. Suitable crude telomers are formed by the addition polymerization reaction of chlorotrifluoroethylene with carbon tetrachloride in the presence of polymerization catalysts, such as ferric chloride and benzoin, and generally have molecular numbers in the range of from 1 to 20. The fluorinating agent of this invention preferably comprises chlorine trifluoride ClF3 and the fluorination catalyst comprises a transition metal halide selected from the group consisting of halides of iron, nickel, chromium, and mixtures thereof. The present process is conducted in at least one fluorination reactor, preferably maintained at from about 1200 to about 25O0C, and continues until the desired degree of fluorination is achieved. In one embodiment, crude telomer is introduced into a fluorination reactor and fluorinated with chlorine trifluoride in the presence of ferric chloride. The excess chlorine trifluoride from this reaction is then reacted with additional crude telemer in the presence of antimony pentachloride in a continuous recycle process. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The fluorination or stabilization process of the present invention is broadly applicable to a wide variety of chlorofluoro telomers. Such telomers can be prepared by the telomerization of a variety of perfluoroolefinic or perfluorochloroolefinic monomers, such as chlorotrifluoroethylene, tetrafluoroethylene, perfluorobutadiene, difluorodichloroethylene, perfluoromonochloropropene, perfluoromonochlorobutene, perfluoropropene, and the like, in the presence of a chlorinated chain transfer solvent, such as carbon tetrachloride, and a suitable polymerization promoter.For convenience, the process of this invention will be more particularly described herein in connection with the telomerization and stabilization of telomers prepared from chlorotrifluoroethylene CTFE monomers, although it will be readily appreciated that the present process is adaptable to the fluorination of other chlorofluoro telomers as well. Although several telomerization methods can be utilized for preparing CTFE telomers, as illustrated hereinbefore, a particularly suitable method involves the reaction of carbon tetrachloride with CTFE in the presence of a catalytic amount of FeCl3, benzoin as a reducing agent for Fe 3 ions, and acetonitrile as a common solvent for the reactants and catalysts. The telomerization reaction can be illustrated as follows EMI6.1 tb CC14 SEP nCF2 CFCl SEP FeCl3 SEP CC13 CF2CFCl nCl tb SEP Benzoin tb The telomerization reaction is generally carried out under elevated temperature and pressure conditions, with temperatures generally ranging from about 900C to about 1500C, and pressures generally in the range of 50 p,s.i. to 400 p.s.l.The telomer chain growth, and hence the average molecular number of the telomer n , is dependent upon the relative concentration of the Fe 3 ions in the solution, the rate at which theFe 3 ions are reduced to the Foe 2 form, and the relative concentrations of the reactants. For purposes of the present invention, telomers having average molecular numbers in the range of from about l to about 20, which vary in viscosity from light oils to greases, are particularly suitable. The telomers are then stripped of unreacted monomer and solvent, and passed through a column of activated alumina to remove the benzoin.The preparation of such telomers is illustrated below inExample 1. The crude CTFE telomer can then be fluorinated to stabilize the end groups primarily CC13 groups , by replacement of chlorine atoms with fluorine, and to saturate any remaining olefinic impurities. The telomer is heated and maintained at elevated temperature, preferably in the range of from about 120 C to about 2500C, and most preferably from about 1500C to about 18O0C. Fluorination occurs by introducing a fluorinating agent into the heated telomer mixture in the presence of a fluorination catalyst. The degree of fluorination of the end groups of the telomer will depend on several factors including the activity of the particular fluorination catalyst, the effectiveness of the fluorinating agent, the temperature of the reaction mixture, and the duration of the fluorination process. The structure of such stabilized telomers with various degrees of fluorination can be represented as shown below, where 2 represents the least fluorinated telomer, i.e. a single fluorine substitution, 3 , 4 , and 5 are progressively more highly fluorinated telomers with two, three and four fluorine substitutions, respectively, and 6 represents the most highly fluorinated telomer with five fluorine substitutions. CFCl2 CF2CFCl nCl 2 CF2Cl CF2CFCl nCl 3 CF2Cl CF2CFCl n1CF2CF2Cl 4 CF3 CF2CFCl n l CF2CF2Cl 5 CF3 CF2CFCl n1CF2CF3 6 Although this invention embraces a variety of fluorinating agents, such as elemental fluorine and hydrogen fluoride, chlorine trifluoride ClF3 is preferred due to its particular effectiveness in fluorinating CTFE telomers. Elemental fluorine is an effective fluorinating agent, but commercially prepared fluorine frequently contains minor amounts of oxygen which may form COF end groups on the telomer chain during fluorination. Hydrogen fluoride is a comparatively inexpensive fluorinating agent, but it is not as effective as Clef3. The fluorination catalysts which are within scope of this invention include transition metal halides selected from the group consisting of halides of iron, nickel, chromium, and mixtures thereof. Representative transition metal halides include FeC13, FeF3, Ni Cl2, Nix2, Cry13 andCrF3. Potassium fluoride KF has also been found to be an effective fluorinating agent, and can be employed as the sole fluorinating agent or in combination with any of the aforementioned transition metal halides. In general, these catalysts are considerably less expensive when com pared to prior art fluorination catalysts, such as CoF3, and are at least as effective.Although the amount of catalyst required in a particular process is not critical, and will depend on catalytic activity, amounts in the range of from about 0.1X to 10 , and preferably 0.5 to 5 , by weight of telomer are generally suitable. In the processes involving the fluorination of CTFE telomers which are produced by redox telomerization, the fluorination catalyst of choice is FeCl3 which has been found to be highly efficient for both fluorinating the end groups of the telomer and saturating the olefinic impurities. Moreover, FeCl3 is fully compatible with the catalyst system used in the redox telomerization process. SbCl5 is highly efficient at fluorinating the end groups, and it is also soluble in the CTFE telomer, enabling fluorination to be carried out more efficiently and at lower temperatures In a continuous recycle process rather than a batch process. However, SbC15 is more expensive than Fecal3 and has been found to be generally less efficient thanFeCl3 at saturating the olefinic impurities. An embodiment of the present invention utilizing bothFeCl3 and SbCl5 as fluorination catalysts will now be more particularly described by reference to the appended drawing. As depicted in the drawing, a mixture of crude liquidCTFE telomer and about 1X FeCl3 by weight are introduced into fluorination reactor 6 through line 4. The mixture is stirred and heated in the reactor to approximately 1650C.Gaseous chlorine trifluoride with nitrogen dilution is added to the mixture through line 2 and reacted for a sufficient period of time to produce a telomer having the desired degree of fluorination. The stabilized product is then fed to filter 28 through line 26 to remove iron catalyst and produce a purified product which can be withdrawn through line 30. Unreacted chlorine trifluoride passes from reactor 6 into scrubber 10, which is maintained at about 1000C, through line 8. A fresh mixture of crude, liquid CTFE telomer and about 1 SbCl5 by weight which has been added to holding tank 22 through line 16, is withdrawn from the holding tank through line 32 and pumped into scrubber 10 by pumping means 24 where it is reacted with the chlorine trifluoride. The partially fluorinated telomer is then recycled to holding tank 22 through line 18. The off gases from the scrubbing process, which may contain traces of fluorinated organics, are removed by line 12, and reacted with sodium hydroxide to remove chlorine.Once the desired degree of fluorination is achieved, the stabilized telomer can be removed from the recycle stream through line 36 and treated with 50 aqueous HCl from line 34 in vessel 40. The purified product can be withdrawn through line 42. The following examples are intended to further illustrate the various embodiments and advantages of the present invention without limiting it thereby. Example 1 illustrates the preparation of a crude CTFE telomer using the redox telomerization process.
