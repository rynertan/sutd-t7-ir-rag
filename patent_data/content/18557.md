# Apparatus and method for dressing a chip site on a substrate.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an apparatus and method for dressing a chip site on a substrate prior to rejoining a chip by solder reflow in which a compliant mask 10 is aligned and placed on the substrate 11 so that remnant solder columns 12 on chip site pads protrude through holes 18 in the mask. A brush 24 mechanically removes excess solder from the columns and dresses the remaining solder to uniform shape.
