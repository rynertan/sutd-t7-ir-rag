## Description
FLAME RETARDANT POLYCARBONATES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to flame retardant polycarbonates, and in particular to aromatic polycarbonates prepared from alkenyl substituted aromatic hydroxy compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION With the increasing public concern for safety, there is a clear need to provide safe materials for commercial and residential use. One particular area of that need is to provide flame resistant or flame retardant polymer products. As a result of this demand, many products are required to meet specified flame retardant criteria by both local and federal governments, and the manufacturers of such products. A well known test for flammability of plastic materials is set forth in Underwriter s Laboratories, standard UL 94, third edition 1980 . This standard sets forth tests by which polymer materials are rated for self extinguishing characteristics. In the prior art, there are many known flame retardant additives which are employed by mixing with a base material to render such material self extinguishing or flame retardant. Such flame retardant additives have been known to be employed in amounts from about 0.2 to 20 weight percent in order to be effective in extinguishing burning of base materials which are combustible. It has also been found that such amounts can have a degrading effect upon the base material to be rendered flame retardant, resulting in the loss of valuable physical properties of the base material. For example, thermal stability, color and corrosion problems are often associated with flame retardant additives of the prior art. The loss of valuable physical properties when employing known flame retardant additives is particularly acute when polycarbonate resins are the base material. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a class of polycarbonates having improved flame retardant properties.Particularly it relates to polycarbonates incorporating olefinic groups having improved flame retardant properties. The polycarbonates of the invention are characterized by superior physical properties, compared to the prior flame retardant compositions described above. Generally, the polycarbonates of the invention are prepared fror aromatic dihydroxy compounds with up to two benzene nuclei, each of which may contain an alkenyl radical as a side chain. The alkenyl radicals of these aromatic dihydroxy compounds should be present in the polycarbonates of the invention in amounts sufficient to improve the flame retardant properties of the base polycarbonates, as measured by Underwriter s Laboratories standard UL 94. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEE INVENTION The present invention provides polycarbonates incorporating unsaturation to improve flame retardant properties. These polycarbonates are prepared from aromatic dihydroxy compounds dihydric phenols with up to two benzene nuclei, at least one of which contains an alkenyl substituent. Suitable alkenyl substituents include beta alkenyl radicals, which may be substituted with a lower alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms.That is, the beta alkenyl groups which form side chains on the aromatic nuclei of the dihydric phenols may be the allyl radical CH2 CH CH2 and derivatives thereof, such as l sethylallyl Cn2 CH cH cH3 , l ethylallyl cH2 cB c2H5 , propylallyl tCE2 CH CH C3E7 , 2 methylallyl CH2 C CH3 CH2 , 2 ethylallyl CH2 C C2H CH2 , 2 propylallyl CH2 C C3H7 CH2 , and 2 butenyl CH3 CH CH CH2 , and the like. At least one of these beta alkenyl radicals is attached to the aromatic dihydroxy compound used to prepare the polycarbonates of the present invention. The beta alkenyl substituted dihydroxy diphenyl alkanes which may be used as starting materials for producing the new polycarbonates of the present invention may be obtained, for example, by condensing the corresponding mono beta alkenyl substituted aromatic mono hydroxy compounds or mixtures thereof with unsubstituted aromatic mono hydroxy compounds with aldehydes or ketones as described by Schnell, Chemistry andPhysics of Polycarbonates, pages 64 65 Interscience 1964 . The polycarbonates of the present invention may alternately be prepared by the Claisen rearrangement of the mono or di beta alkenyl ethers of the corresponding aromatic dihydroxy compounds, or of mono or dibeta alkenyl substituted compounds, or by nuclear alkenylization of the corresponding aromatic dihydroxy compound with an alkenyl halogenide. Typical alkenyl substituted dihydric phenol compounds which may be used to prepare polycarbonates of the present invention include 3,3 diallyl 4,4 dihydroxyidphenyl 2,2 propane 3,3 di l methyl allyl 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl 2, 2 propane 3,3 di 2 methyl allyl 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl 2, 2 propane 3,3 di l ethyl allyl 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl 2, 2 propane 3,3 di 3 propyl allyl 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl 2, 2 propane.
