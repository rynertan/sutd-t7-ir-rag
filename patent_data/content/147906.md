# Improvements in process and apparatus for decorating the surfaces of electron irradiation cured coatings on radiation sensitive substrates.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for decorating electron beam cured coatings 3 on radiation sensitive substrates 1 such as paper and the like, with metallized decorative and other layers 5 , by using release layers 4 , to which the decorative layers are applied and bonding the same to electron beam cured adhesive coatings during curing of the same so that the decorative layers may be transferred to the cured coated substrate by peeling off the release layer.
