# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE PASSIVATION

## Abstract
A method of semiconductor device passivation in which a pasivation moat 5 6 is formed initially, at least, by cutting with a laser beam. The moat is preferably finished to its final di mensions by chemical etching. To trace out the path of the moat either the device may be moved relative to a stationary la ser beam or the laser beam may be moved relative to a statio nary device.
