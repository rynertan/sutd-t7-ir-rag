# Collapsible aerial.

## Abstract
Collapsible aerial including bar like base structure with aerial rods 2 stifty attached thereto. The base structure comprises bars 1 which are connected in pairs to each other via a longitudinal joint 5 , the bars associated with different pairs 3, 4 being connected via transverse joints 6 . In the operational state of the aerial the pivotal axis of the longitudinal joints 5 coincide, and the transverse joints 6 have separate pivotal axis. When a locking device 7 is released, the aerial rods 2 may be pivoted about the longitudinal joints 5 into a partially collapsed state, with the aerial rods on one side of the structure. The pivoting axis of the transverse hinges 6 then coincide so that the aerial rods can be swung about these joints to an entirely collapsed state. In this state the aerial rods 2 on the different bar pairs 3, 4 cross over each other.
