# Tele diaphanography apparatus.

## Abstract
A tele diaphanography apparatus suitable for transillu minating human or animal tissues B comprises a first torch 2 including a source of light 18 of wavelength from 300 nanometers to 2000 nanometers means 28,30 for directing light from the first torch onto the tissues to be visually examined by transillumination, and a heat absorbing filter 38 located in the path of the light from the light source 18 a second torch 4 including a source of light of the same wavelength and means for directing the light from the second torch through the tissues onto a light detector a visual display unit 10 for displaying the image detected by the light detector 8 and recording means 12 for recording the image detected by the light detector 8 .
