# COAL PREPARATION

## Abstract
A method of preparing fine particulate coal for power generation on which the coal is pretreated by the oil agglomeration method 10, 11 to increase the carbonaceous content and produce coal oil agglomerates. These are fed to a fluidized bed 15 in which the fluid is steam. The bed as concentration is variable and agglomerates leaving the bed are disintegrated in a steam jet 21 which completes separation of the oil from the coal and forms the fine particle coal feed. The oil and steam are separated from the coal feed which continues in the fuel delivery system 29 to the power generation plant. The only steam mix is condensed 37 and the two phases separated 39 and recycled for further use. A control means is provided which is responsive to steam generation demand and activates changes in the generation of coal oil agglomerates 10, 11 and the discharge of coal particles from the fluid bed, disintegrator 15, 21.
