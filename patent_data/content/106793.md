## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to 7a substituted 17a pregn 4 ene 21,17 carbolactones and 21 carboxylic acid salts, procedures for manufacturing them and pharmaceutical preparations containing them. In treatment with spironolactone there are frequently encountered undesirable endocrine side effects that are caused by the antiandrogenic and gestagenic activity of spironolactone. Thus, the occurrence of gynecomastia is observed in extended treatment of male patients with spironolactone Smith, W.G., The Lancet 1962, p 886 Mann, N.M., JAMA 1963, p 778 Clark, E., JAMA 1965, p 157 Greenblatt, D.J., JAMA 1973, p 82 and impotence Greenblatt, D.J., JAMA 1973, p 82 . This can be traced to the antiandrogenic side effect of this compound Steelman, S.L. et al, Steroids 1963, p 449 Schane, H.P.,J of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 1978, p 691 . The side effects on women being treated with spironolactone, such as amenorrhea and menstrual irregularities, on the other hand, are ascribed to the gestagenic side effect of spironolactone. Both side effects can be demonstrated in animal experiments as well as in vitro using the receptor binding test with the androgen or gestagen receptor.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide compounds that are, preferably, at least a little better than spironolactone in antialdosterone effect, but which have strongly reduced antiandrogenic and gestagenic side effects. Upon further study of the specification and appended claims, further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. These objects have been achieved by this invention by providing 7a substituted 17a pregn 4 ene 21, 17 carbolactones and 21 carboxylic acid salts of formulaI.EMI2.1 whereinC1 C2 is a C C single or C C double bond,EMI2.2 R is a saturated or unsaturated, straight chain or branched aliphatic radical of 1 6 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by a chlorine atom or a hydroxy group, and E isEMI3.1 wherein M is an alkali metal, e.g., Na, R , preferably potassium.DETAILED DISCUSSION The compounds of formula I contain in the 7a position a saturated or unsaturated straight chain or branched aliphatic radical R of 1 6 carbon atoms optionally substituted by a chlorine atom or a hydroxyl group, for example, alkyl or alkenyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, isobutyl, isobutenyl, chloropropyl, or hydroxypropyl, the propyl and butyl groups being preferred. The new compounds of formula I have the property of neutralizing or reversing the effect of aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone on the elimination of sodium and potassium. The compounds according to this invention are thus suited for the treatment of certain forms of hypertension, edemas, primary aldosteronism, and other endocrine disturbances caused by aldosterone. They can also be used as diuretics. The new compounds have the advantage, compared with spironolactone, of having fewer side effects. The antialdosterone effect was determined and measured in an experimental model by Hallmann G. Hollmann et al, Tubular Effects and Renal Elimination of Spironolactones, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Exp. Path. Pharmak.247 1964 , p 419 P. Marx, Renal Effects of d aldosterone and Its Antagonist Spironolactone, Diss. Med. Fak. FUBerlin, 1966 whose disclosure is incorporated by references herein . The androgen receptor binding test is conducted as follows The androgen receptor protein contained in the cytosol of a homogenate of rat prostates binds dihydrotestosterone DHT with high affinity but with low capacity. If this receptor is charged with 3H DHT in the presence of the compound to be tested, the concentration and the binding affinity of the compound to be tested determine the degree to which 3H DHT is displaced from the receptor. After separation of the receptor bound DHT from the non bound, binding can be determined in percent, and this value can be plotted against the logarithm of the molar concentration of the test substance. It is then determined what concentration of the test substance is required to displace the reference substance completely from the receptor.The competition factor CF as a measure of the binding strength is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the test substance to the concentration of the reference substance, so that a highCF value indicates low binding strength, whereas a low CF value indicates high affinity. The antiandrogen effect can be determined with compounds which in themselves have no androgen effect but which through their high binding affinity fully or partially displace the body s own androgen from the receptor, as is observed to a certain degree with spironolactone. Thus a high competition factor is desirable in the androgen and gestagen receptor test. The gestagen receptor test is conducted in the same manner using cytosol from rat uterus homogenate. The following table summarizes the relative values of the degree of antialdosterone effect spironolactone 1 and the competition factors in the androgen receptor test KA and in the gestagen receptor test KG of spironolactone and the compounds according to the invention as exemplified by I 7a butyl 15ss,16B methylene 3 oxo 17a pregn 4 ene 21,17 carbolactone, and II 156,166 methylene 3 oxo 7a propyl 17a pregna 1, 4 diene 21,17 carbolactone. TABLECompound Relative antialdo Competition factor sterone effect KA KGSpironolactone 1 8.9 21 I Y 0.6 88 23 II 1 112 55 The table shows that the compounds according to this invention are about as effective as spironolactone in their principal effect as aldosterone antagonists, but surprisingly exhibit as side effects a strongly reduced binding with the androgen or gestagen receptor. 7a substituted 17a pregn 4 ene 21 , 17 carbolac tones containing no methyl ring in the 15,16 position are already known from European patent 0018245. In comparison with these non methylenated compounds, the new compounds according to this invention, which contain a methyl ring in the 15,16 position, exhibit a lower antiandrogenic side effect along with about the same antialdosterone effect. The compounds according to this invention can be formulated according to known galenic methods as medicines for oral or parenteral administration to mammals, including humans. They can be dosed and administered in the same or analogous manner as the commerical product spironolactone. Typically, dosages are 25 500 mg day preferably 50 400 mg day. Conventional excipients are pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for pzrenteral, enteral or topical application which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to water, salt solutions, alcohols, gum arabic, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatine, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, pentaerythritol fatty acid esters, hydroxy methylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, etc. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring, flavoring and or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. For parenteral application, particularly suitable are injectable sterile solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages. For enteral application, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees, suppositories or capsules having talc and or a carbohydrate carrier or binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and or corn starch and or potato starch. A syrup, elixir or the like can be used wherein a sweetened vehicle is employed. Sustained release compositions can be formulated including those wherein the active compound is protected with differentially degradable coatings, e.g., by microencapsulation, multiple coatings, etc. Dosages for a given host for a given indication can be determined, e.g., by customary comparison of the activities of the subject compound and of a known agent by means of an appropriate, conventional pharmacological protocol. The compounds according to this invention can be produced by reacting a compound of formula IIEMI7.1 whereinC1 C2 andEMI7.2 are the same as in formula I, in conventional manner with a Grignard compound of formulaIII RMgHal III whereinR is as defined in formula I and Hal is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, in the presence of a copper salt or a compound of formula IV R 2Cu Li IV R is as defined in formula I, optionally, conventionally introducing a double bond and or optionally, conventionally splitting the lactone ring through the effect of an alkali metal hydroxide. The reaction with the Grignard compound is conventionally carried out in the presence of a copper salt or an organometallic compound R 2 Cult. Copper chloride, copper bromide, and copper iodide are especially suitable as copper salts. Any solvent can be used in the reaction that is inert with respect to the reactants. Especially good are aprotic solvents miscible in water, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetonitrile, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and triethylene glycol dimethyl ether. The reaction is best carried out at low temperatures, preferably 30 to 200C. To complete the process, the reaction mixture is taken up in acids. Strong acids like hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid are suitable. The optional subsequent introduction of the double bond takes place according to known methods, with the use of either chemical or microbiological means.Suitable chemical dehydration agents include, for example, selenium dioxide, 2,3 dichloro 5,6 dicyanobenzoquinone, chloranil, thallium triacetate, or lead tetraacetate. Suitable microorganisms for the 1,2 dehydration include, for example, Schizomycetes, especially those of the genera Arthrobacter, e.g., A. simplex ATCC 6946 Bacillus, e.g., B. lentus ATCC 13805 and B. sphaericusATCC 7055 Pseudomonas, e.g., P. aeruginosa IFO 3505 Flavobacterium, e.g., F. flavescens IFO 3058 Lactobacillus, e.g., L. brevis IFO 3345 and Nocardia, e.g.,N. opaca ATCC 4276. Details are fully conventional. The 1,2 dehydration is preferably carried out chemically. In this regard, the 1,2 dihydrosteroid is heated for a prolonged period in a suitable solvent with the dehydration agent. Suitable solvents include, for example, dioxane, tert butyl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, benzene, or mixtures of these. The reaction is completed after several. hours. It is recommended that the reaction be conducted by using thin layer chromatography. The reaction mixture is exhausted when the initial material has been converted. The optional subsequent splitting of the lactone ring likewise takes place according to known methods.Through the action of an alkali metal hydroxide, preferably potassium hydroxide, during heating, the alkali metal salt of 3 substituted propionic acid is formed. The starting materials of formula II used in the process according to this invention are described in theGerman laid open application 26 52 761 whose disclosure is incorporated by references herein.
