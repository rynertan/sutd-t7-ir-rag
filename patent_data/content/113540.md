# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES, AND METHODS OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
A semiconductor FET device includes a channel region 16 of a predetermined doping concentration and thickness so as to form an active pn junction between the gate contact and source region of the semiconductor device. The pn junction creates an active intrinsic junction FET JFET which may be pinched off in the operating region of the FET device. The resultant combination is a cascode FET JFET amplifier arrangement, which comprises operating characteristics of longer gate length devices than the FET device alone, maintaining high saturation output resistance and high d.c. voltage gain.
