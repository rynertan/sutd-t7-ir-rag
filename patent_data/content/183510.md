# A fitting for clamping a pipe.

## Abstract
A fitting use in clamping a pipe to a fixture to form a weldless, leakproof connection therebetween, the fitting comprising a locking ring 15 having an interior diameter sized to slide onto a pipe 11 12 in close fitting relationship without galling the pipe 11 12 and having an exterior diameter tapered to define a frusto conical section a rigid collar 16 adapted for connection to the fixture and having longitudinal opening therethrough, the opening tapering inwardly from a selected exterior diameter to an interior diameter equal to the interior diameter of the locking ring 15 to define a frusto conical section complementary to the frusto conical section of the locking ring 15 whereby the ring is slideable into the collar 16 is close fittig rela tionship, the collar 16 also having a plurality of bolt holes 18 disposed radially around the opening and generally parallel thereto a locking flange 13 having an opening to receive the pipe and a plurality of both holes 14 , com plementary to the holes 18 of the collar 16 disposed radially around the opening and a plurality of bolt means 19 for clamping the flange tightly against the collar whereby upon tightening of the bolts the locking ring 15 is urged into the opening in the collar 16 , compressing the ring 15 against the pipe 11 12 .
