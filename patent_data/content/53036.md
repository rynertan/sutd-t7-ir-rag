## Abstract
A high frequency attenuation cable which includes a conductor a high frequency absorption medium surround ing the conductor for attenuating high frequency energy through the cable dielectric surrounding the absorption medium electrical shielding surrounding the dielectric con fining the high frequency energy to the absorption medium and electrically conductive outer jacketing surrounding the shielding preventing the shielding from becoming a high frequency transmission line. A high frequency attenuation harness may comprise one or more of said cables.
