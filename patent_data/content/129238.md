# Method and device for preparing paper rolls for rotary presses and the like.

## Abstract
The web leading edge E of a paper roll R for a rotary press or the like is held and prevented from raveling by three or more pieces of strong adhesive tape Ta during handling and loading onto a paper feed machine of the printing press. On the paper feed machine, perforated tear lines 15 are formed across the tape pieces Ta by a device comprising a rotary perforating wheel 42 , a mechanism for moving the wheel from one end to the other of the roll R and also moving it against and away from all of the tape pieces Ta , and a tape detecting device BS and a controller 45 for automatically operating the mechanism. The tape pieces Ta can then be easily torn to release the web leading edge E immediately prior to web splicing.
