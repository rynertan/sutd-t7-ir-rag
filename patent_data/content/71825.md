# GLASSWARE HANDLING MEANS

## Abstract
The present invention was developed to provide an improved process for retaining the substantially pristine state of glass articles, particularly thin walled, lightweight glass containers. In particular, this invention relates to a process of maintaining the strength of glass containers formed from molten glass gobs as encountered especially in conventional press and blow or blow and blow equip ment of individual section glass machines, the process com prising initially forming a formed portion from each of said gobs, fully forming the remaining portions of the containers from said gobs, grasping the thus formed containers only at the initially formed portion and transferring them to a cradle device whereby said containers are held in spaced relation ship to each other and held free of contacting any solid or unsmooth surface including stoplates, bearing surfaces, conveying belts and the like, partially cooling immediately following the formation of said containers, moving said cradle device with the accompanying containers to an an nealing zone whereby the containers including the bottom walls thereof are subjected to a controlled rate of cooling therein, and finally rapidly cooling said containers to am bient temperature while still being gripped only at the initi ally formed portions thereof.
