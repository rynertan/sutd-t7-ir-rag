# Processing method of image data and system therefor.

## Abstract
The present invention makes it possible to reduce the processing time by dividing an image, which is to be subjected to a processing, into a plurality of sections and subjecting the thus divided images to an image processing in a limited memory space, especially, by making most effective use of the memory spaces of plural buffer memor ies to reduce the number of divisions of the original picture when a high speed affine transformation is performed in the plural buffer memories.
