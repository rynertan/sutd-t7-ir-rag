## Description
This invention relates to devices for measuring radiation, and may be used for example in analysing combustion processes e.g. heat transfer in the combustion chambers of gas turbine engines. The life and reliability of engine components and in particular combustor walls has always been a subject of a great deal of interest. The evaluation of combustor wall life is done by using various equations and empirical relations. A lot of this in turn depends on the temperature of the walls. These temperatures are a consequence of various convective, conductive and radiative heat fluxes within the combustion gas. Therefore it is important both to be able to measure and to be able to model radiative heat transfer accurately. The present modelling of radiative heat transfer needs input of absorption coefficients. An absorption coefficient is a function of wavelength, local gas temperature and gas composition, although the present modelling techniques use grey gas absorption coefficients ones that do not depend on wavelength . A known technique the Schmidt method for making radiation measurements in a combustion chamber uses a detector located outside a window in one wall of the combustion chamber and a background radiation source a furnace located in a line of sight outside a window in an opposite wall. A chopper is positioned in front of the radiation source to enable alternate measurements along the line of sight with the radiation source, and without it i.e. measurement of just the emission from the combustion process . Since the radiation emitted by the furnace is known, this gives the proportion of radiation that is absorbed by the flame in the combustion chamber. This quantity is often known as absorbtivity of the flame. It is also possible to deduce radially weighted values of temperatures. The temperatures so determined are sometimes called Schmidt temperatures or brightness temperatures because they are not strictly temperatures. Norgren and Claus NASA technical notes TN6410,1971 TMX 3394,1976 and technical paper 1722,1981 have used this technique with measurements in specific wavelength bands to determine smoke concentrations. One major drawback of Schmidt type methods is that they give non linearly weighted averages of unknown quantities across the width of the combustor, and local variations along the line of sight cannot be deduced. Moreover, on a test rig, there may not be two appropriately aligned holes in the combustor walls for the source and detector, so modification of the combustor may be required and on a working gas turbine engine aligned holes are out of the question. Furthermore, the local gas composition cannot be deduced. Present gas analysis techniques involve taking gas samples, which is difficult to arrange without disturbing the combustion process. It has also been proposed to measure temperature and soot concentration by traversing across a flame Beer and Claus, The traversing method of radiation measurement in luminous flames , J. Inst. Fuel, vol.35 pp.437 443, 1962 . A development of this technique in which spectral measurements i.e. measurement of radiation at a plurality wavelengths are made is described by Hammond and Beer, Spatial Distribution of Spectral Radiant Energy in a Pressure Jet Oil Flame , Heat Transfer in Flames Chapter 19 , Scripta Book Co., 1974. In this technique, a sight tube from the source furnace is traversed across the flame, and averaged measurements are obtained alone a line of sight from the position of the end of the sight tube in the flame to the detector. Thus, this technique still has the problem noted above of requiring a line of sight, and of providing only averaged measurements from the position of the end of the sight tube in the flame to the external detector . There is no correlation between measurements at different positions along the traverse of the sight tube. EP A 143, 282 discloses a known method and apparatus for calculating the temperature of an object using measurements made at several different temperatures of the radiation emitted in several radiation ranges. A set of equations containing the measured values are solved by a given formula to yield values for the unknown temperatures. The measured radiation is still collected, however, by a fixed, non intrusive optical system and therefore suffers from the drawback of a Schmidt type method by measuring an unknown quantity averaged along the line of sight of the optical system. Apparatus described in GB 2,109,472 for measuring the temperature of an object in a combustion region comprises a pyrometer and a moveable radiation collecting system which, capable of withstanding the temperatures encountered, is adapted for insertion into the combustion region. The pyrometer is used to make spot measurements of the radiation emitted by the object. The collection system consists of a moveable tube, internally cooled for insertion into the combustion region close to the object. The end of this tube is fitted with a window to admit radiation to this interior where it is reflected by a mirror towards the pyrometer. The tube is moveable axially and rotationally to permit an object like a turbine blade to be scanned. The radiation collecting window has to be positioned close to the object in question to avoid the drawbacks of line of sight averaging previously referred to. The invention is intended to overcome these drawbacks in measurements of the local temperature of hot gases in a combustion chamber or furnace by, in broadest terms, obtaining two measurements at positions very close together and basing a temperature calculation on differential radiation intensity measurements. Furthermore, the invention enables full spatial resolution of the gas temperature from a whole series of such measurements made in incremental steps traversing the gas volume. In accordance with the present invention, intensity is measured at at least two neighbouring local positions. Preferably spectral radiance ie at a plurality of wavelengths is measured at the neighbouring positions, and used to determine local gas composition and temperature. The spectral measurements at a given position are preferably made simultaneously. The invention provides a method of making measurements on combustion gases in a combustion process comprising the steps of Each component i of the combustion gas has its own characteristic trace of absorption coefficient of the combustion gas Kλ , Let I where I Each of these K Equation 2 above can be simplified to give the following relationship for grey raidation ie over a broad band of wavelengths where K is the grey absorption coefficient given by Using the simplified recurrence relation 3 therefore, even grey ie non spectral measurements of radiation at neighbouring nodes n and n 1 separated by distance s can yield useful results. The present invention also provides a device for measuring raidation from combustion gases in a combustion process according to the above method, comprising In order that the invention may be better understood, preferred embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, wherein The example probe shown in figure 1 comprises an elongate sight tube 10, made of a material capable of withstanding the temperature and pressures of a gas turbine engine combustion chamber. A suitable material is SiC sold under the trade name Refel. The tube 10 passes slidingly through a seal 12 in an outer combustor casing 14, and through an air bleed hole 16 in an inner combustor wall 18, so that an inner end 10a of the tube 10 is transversable across a combustion chamber 20, and an outer end 10b is located outside the engine. The tube 10 has a calcium fluoride window 22 at its inner end 10a and also possibly at its outer end 10b. The tube may be evacuated or may contain nitrogen gas which has satisfactory radiation transmitting properties . The tube may have an outer sleeve 24 for circulation of a cooling fluid, or the outer end 10b may be connected to a cooling nitrogen gas supply, so that the nitrogen contents are purged into the interior of the combustion chamber. In the latter case, the window 22 may not be necessary, but there could be a risk of the nitrogen purge disturbing the combustion process to be studied. In order that the inner end 10a of the tube 10 can traverse the combustion chamber, drive means 26 are provided. Schematically this is illustrated in Fig. 1 as a rack and motorised pinion, and a stepper motor is preferred since this gives accurate control of position during the traverse. The speed of the traverse depends on factors such as flame temperature. Alternative drive means are of course possible, for example an hydraulic piston and cylinder, preferably with a transducer to indicate position during the traverse. It will be appreciated that an accurate knowledge of the position of the tube end 10a is desirable if one is to measure localised conditions within the combustion chamber. The traverse path would normally be radial, but any other path which it is desired to study can be chosen. While the entire tube 10 is illustrated as being movable in Fig. 1, it would be possible to devise a telescopic arrangement whereby the inner end 10a traversed the combustion chamber while the outer end 10b remained stationary. The outer end 10b of the tube 10 is provided with a radiation detector 28 which is capable of measuring intensities of radiation transmitted along the tube 10, simultaneously at a plurality of different wavelengths. This is done at a plurality of different positions along the traverse path of the end 10a. The wavelengths detected are typically in the range 0.3 to 12 µm, though wavelengths outside this range are not excluded. Fig. 2 illustrates a simple detector arrangement for achieving this. The incoming radiation from the tube 10 is split into different wavelengths by a diffraction grating or prism at 38, and directed at an array of photo sensors 40. In this way, each sensor 40 receives radiation of a unique wavelength and produces a corresponding output. A reading is taken simultaneously from each sensor 40 at each of a plurality of positions during a single traverse. The same effect is achieved by the arrangement of Fig. 3. Here, the incoming radiation passes to an array of sensors 42, each of which has an individual filter 44 making it sensitive to a specific wavelength. The sensors 42 and filters 44 could be individual miniature detectors, or could all be integrated on one semiconductor chip. The arrangement of Fig. 2 has the disadvantage that the detectors need to be spaced to suit the wavelengths to be detected, and so a compact arrangement may not be possible. On the other hand, the arrangement of Fig. 3 requires the use of very small detectors, which is difficult to achieve at present. Figs. 4 and 5 show an arrangement which overcomes these problems. Thermopile detectors 46, each made sensitive to a chosen wavelength by an individual filter 48 in front of it, are arranged circumferentially around a circular cross section prism 50 at the end 10b of the tube 10. The prism 50 shown is cylindrical, but the outer face of the prism 50 has an internally conical surface 52, and the angle of the cone is chosen so that incoming radiation from the tube 10 suffers internal reflection at the surface 52 and is reflected equally on to each of the surrounding detectors. In this way, it is easy to arrange, say, twelve detectors in the minimum possible space. As an alternative, Fig. 6 shows a cone 54 with a reflecting outer conical surface 56, which reflects the incoming radiation to the detectors 46. Instead of a reflecting cone 54, a reflecting hemisphere or pyramid with as many sides as there are detectors could be used and the surface 52 in Fig. 4 could likewise be hemispherical or pyramidal. The arrays of detectors and filters in Figs. 4 to 6 are cylindrical and the angle of the reflecting conical surface to the incoming radiation is 45 . This ensures that the radiation is incident on the filters in the direction normal to their surface. The importance of this is that the calibration of such filters is only accurate for radiation incident normally. If the angle of the conical surface is other than 45 e.g. to ensure total internal reflection the array of detectors and filters and the adjacent external surface of the prism should be in the form of a cone, of an angle to ensure normal incidence. Where a hemispherical or pyramidal reflecting surface is used, the external surface of the prism, and the receiving surfaces of the filters taken together, are likewise hemispherical or pyramidal with faces at an appropriate angle to the tube 10 to ensure normal incidence . It will be seen that the advantage of a pyramidal arrangement is that the surfaces of the filters do not need to be concave in the circumferential direction to ensure adherence to their calibration. The detector 28 in any of the above arrangements is connected by cables 60 to a remote signal processor 58 Fig.1 which includes an amplifying circuit 62 and an analogue to digital converter and sampling circuit 64. This automatically takes a batch of readings from the detector 28 at a succession of adjacent positions throughout the traverse, synchronised with the motion of the tube 10 by a circuit 66 so that the positions at which the readings are taken are known. At each position, there is a simultaneous reading for each wavelength of interest. The readings can be stored, e.g., on magnetic tape, for subsequent processing by a computer 68 or such processing can take place in real time if adequate computing power is available. If desired, the amplifying circuit 62, the analogue to digital converter and sampling circuit 64 and the synchronising circuit 66 could be located with the detector 28. The readings obtained for a given pair of neighbouring locations are processed by the computer in accordance with the discussion above relating to equations 1 and 2 . Soot emits and absorbs throughout the spectrum. But the gaseous species have specific wavelengths that are predominant. This is illustrated in graphical form for various typical species in Fig. 7, but these values are not exhaustive, and the required data includes the absorption coefficients K One can find two clear wavelengths where only soot effects are important. Applying equation 2 and then 1 , one can solve for C In use, the probe 10 is caused to traverse the combustion chamber, and the computer 68 is programmed as shown in Fig. 8 which assumes the results are to be calculated in real time . Firstly, at step 72, values of I It will be appreciated that, should insufficient computing power be available for this real time approach, the acquired intensity values at each position of the traverse may simply be recorded on magnetic tape or some other medium. Steps 78, 80 and 82 are then performed subsequently on the recorded data. If desired, a simplified probe and processing procedure may be used. The detector 28 contains only one sensor, sensitive to a band of wavelengths i.e., grey radiation . At steps 72 and 76 in Fig. 8, only grey intensities I
