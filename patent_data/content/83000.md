# DEVICE FOR INDICATING THE DRIVING OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE OF A MOTOR VEHICLE

## Abstract
A device for indicating the driving operation of an internal combustion engine in a motor vehicle is disclosed. The pressure variation within an air inlet duct of the engine is sensed or detected by pressure detecting means, which cause output means to produce in response to the degree of the pressure within the duct an output which in turn operates to turn on at least one of the indicator lights of different colors. These indicator lights are arranged in series on an indicator board so as to be turned on in decreasing order in the pressure level within the duct. The indicator board is adapted to be disposed on the dash pannel of the vehicle such that these indicator lights are to be within the peripheral vision of the driver who can easily perceive the particular indicator light being turned on without detracting his attention from the traffic scene. Accordingly, the driver can learn from the device at any driving situations in order to comform his driving habit into the one which assures efficient engine operation as well as efficient fuel consumption through the course of his travel. In addition to the indicator lights, a loudspeaker is provided for warning the driver of his driving behavior operating the engine to an unpermissible extent so as to avoid such violent driving operation.
