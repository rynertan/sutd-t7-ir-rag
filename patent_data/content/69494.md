According to this invention, cyclic carbonates are manufactured by a process comprising contacting an oxirane of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R, R , R and R are independently H, an aliphatic group, an alicyclic group, an aromatic group or a substituted aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic group, with a heterocumulene in the presence of a catalytic system comprising A. a transition metal complex of the formula L M II y wherein M is at least one of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb and Ta L is an anionic ligand capable of dissociation and y is a number sufficient to satisfy the valency requirement of M and a a Lewis base. The cyclic carbonates here used are the reaction products of the oxiranes of formula I and the heterocumulenes as defined below and specifically include the reaction product of an oxirane and the heterocumulene S02. The oxiranes here used are compounds of formula I where R, R , Rn and R are as previously defined.The aromatic group can be monocyclic, such as phenyl, or polycyclic, either fused or nonfused. Examples of polycyclic fused aromatic groups are anthracenyl, naphthacenyl, pyrenyl and the like. Examples of polycyclic, nonfused aromatic groups are biphenyl, 2,2 binaphthalenyl, p terphenyl and the like. Monocyclic aromatic groups are preferred to polycyclic aromatic groups and phenyl is the preferred monocyclic aromatic group. The alicyclic groups can be saturated or unsaturated, monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbons and preferably are of 3 to 12 carbon atoms. The alicyclic groups are preferred to the aromatic groups. The monocyclic, alicyclic groups include cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclobutylenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclooctyl and the like. The polycyclic, alicyclic groups can be fused or nonfused and include bicyclo 1.1.0 butyl, bicyclo 2.2.13heptyl, bicyclopentyl, pentalenyl, heptalenyl and the like. Cycloalkyl groups, both mono and polycyclic, are preferred to cycloalkyenyl groups and C5 to C8 monocyclic cycloalkyls are the preferred alicyclic groups. The aliphatic groups can be linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons and generally are of 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The aliphatic groups are preferred to the aliphatic groups. Representative aliphatic groups include alkynyl, alkenyl and alkyl groups. Representative alkynyl groups include propynyl, butynyl and pentynyl groups, while representative alkenyl groups include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl and heptenyl groups. The preferred aliphatic groups are the alkyl groups such as dimethyl, hexyl, octyl, isopropyl and t butyl. Most preferred are the linear alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms1 i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. When R and R are each aliphatic groups, they can join to form a ring and include oxirane compounds such as cyclohexene oxide. R, R , R and R can independently contain one or more substituents that do not interfere with the process of the invention. Representative substituents include halogens, amides, gamines, nitriles, thiols, hydroxyls and the like. The aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic groups may also contain substituents selected from one of the other groups. For example, an aromatic or alicyclic group may contain an aliphatic substituent and the aromatic groups may contain an alicyclic substituent. Examples of this broad group of substituted groups include toluenyl, 1,3dimethyl benzenyl, indolyl, oxacyclopenta 2,4 dienyl furanyl , pyridinyl, oxaspiropentane and the like. The term oxirane as here used means compounds containing at least one moiety of the formula EMI4.1 Illustrative oxiranes of this invention include oxirane ethylene oxide , methyl oxirane propylene oxide , phenyl oxirane styrene oxide , dimethyl oxirane, anthracenyl oxirane, propenyl oxirane, butyl oxirane and the like. The common names for these compounds are found in the parentheses. The preferred oxiranes are oxirane ethylene oxide and methyl oxirane propylene oxide . The heterocumulenes here used are unsaturated compounds containing two or more successive double bonds such that two different atoms are joined by at least one double bond. Typically, heterocumulenes are three atom molecules such as C02, CS2, COS andS02, but also include organic compounds such as C1 toC8 dialkyl or diaryl ketenes, C1 to C8 alkyl or aryl isocyanates carbonyl amino and C1 to C8 alkyl or aryl diimides. Examples of these organic heterocumulenes include diphenyl ketene, 1 carbonyl amino propane, 1,4 bis carbonyl amino benzene, p tolylcarbodiimide and the like. Preferred heterocumulenes include CO2, COS and S02 with CO2 being the most preferred. A polar solvent may be employed in the present invention, its use or non use depending upon the nature of the reactants and the process conditions employed. The principal purpose for using the solvent is to provide a homogeneous liquid phase by solubilizing the oxirane or transition metal complex when either or both are a solid at process conditions. Other reasons for employing a solvent include monitoring process conditions, ease in handling reactants, etc. Polar solvents are those which generally produce electrically conducting solutions and cause dissociation of the solute into ions. Useful polar solvents can be selected from a wide range of compounds, such as alcohols, ketones, ethers, esters, amides, halogenated hydrocarbons and the like.A few of these solvents, such as certain alcohols and ketones, may react with the process reagents, catalysts and or product under certain process conditions, and thus their use may be less desirable than the use of other solvents. Preferred polar solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, methylene chloride and chloroform. The catalytic system of this invention consists of two parts, a transition metal complex and a Lewis base. The transition metal complex itself is cbmposed of at least two parts, a transition metal M and a ligand L. Optionally, the complex can also contain a cycloalkadienyl or an allyl component L and thus be of the formula L L N wherein x is a number from xy O to about 2, y is a number from 0 to about 5 and the sum of x y is a number sufficient to satisfy the valency requirement of M. As noted earlier, M is a Group IVB Ti, Zr, Hf and or a Group VB V, Nb, Ta metal and is preferably one of Ta, Zr and Hf, in particular Ta. L is an anionic ligand capable of dissociation. Typically, L is a halide cm , Br , I , F , preferably C1 but can also be, among others, a hydride, A , OA , NA2 ,SA and SiA3 , where A is a C1 to C6 alkyl group. The optional L is a cycloalkadienyl group having a C4 toC10 carbon ring or an allyl group. In addition to partially satisfying the valency and charge requirements of the metal, M, L changes the solubility and or stability of the metal complex and in some cases can alter the reactivity of the catalytic system through steric or electronic effects.The cycloalkadienyl ring can also contain substituents such as C1 to C4 alkyl or aromatic hydrocarbon groups or can be fused to one or more aromatic rings. Examples of L include cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and indenyl. Illustrative transition metal complexes includeTaCl5, TaCl3Br2, ZrCl4, NbCl5, HfCl4, NbBr5, Cp2TiCl2 wherein Cp is cyclopentadienyl , Cp2TiH2, Cp 2TiCl2 where Cp is pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and Ta OC2H5 5. The transition metal complexes of this invention are prepared by various methods broadly taught in the art and many such as TaCl5 and HfCl4 are commercially available. While not wanting to be bound to theory, it is believed that the transition metal complex and oxirane react to form a catalytic species of the transition metal complex of the formula EMI7.1 wherein the sum of x y z satisfies the valency requirement of M. This species is formed by the insertion of a ringopened oxirane compound into a M L bond of a transition metal complex precursor such as the transition metal complexes described above. Such species are typically formed in situ by the reaction of a transition metal complex precursor with an oxirane, but can also be prepared and isolated by the reaction of a L substituted alcohol, such as chloropropanol, with a transition metal complex precursor such as TaCl. The second part of this catalytic system is aLewis base or the soluble salt of a Lewis base. Lewis bases are commonly known to those skilled in the art as compounds which are capable of donating a pair of electrons to form an adduct with a Lewis acid.Illustrative bases include pyridine, piperidine, triphenylphosphine trialkylphosphine, sodium alkoxide, ammonium halide salts, potassium amides and lithium halides. Preferred bases are pyridne, lithium iodide and tetra n butylammonium bromide. The temperature and pressure of this process can vary widely. Typically, the temperature ranges from about 200 to about 2000C,preferably from about 500 to 1000C. Subatmospheric, atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure can be used but typically, the pressure ranges from about 1 to about 101 bar about 1 to about 100 atms , preferably from about 20 to about 41 bar about 20 to about 40 atoms . The mixture is preferably agitated while being heated. The concentration of the transition metal complex typically ranges from about 0.001 to 100 parts per 1,000 parts of oxirane and preferably ranges from about 0.1 to 10 parts of transition metal complex per 1,000 parts of oxirane. The concentration of the Lewis base is typically from 0.001 to 100 parts per 1,000 parts of oxirane and preferably ranges from about 0.2 to about 50 parts of base per 1,000 parts of oxirane. The process can be conducted in a homogeneous or heterogeneous mode. A homogeneous mode, i.e. the reactants and catalyst in one phase, can be accomplished by solubilizing those reactants which remain in a solid phase at. process conditions in a polar solvent.A heterogeneous mode can be accomplished by incorporating the components of the catalytic system onto an appropriate support. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples. All of the experiments were conducted in a 300 ml Parr Hastelloy C autoclave equipped with a stirring mechanism and a temperature control. The specific metal complexes, bases and reaction times are reported in Table I. All experiments were conducted in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran except example 8, in which 25 ml were used. The procedure of Example 1 was used throughout unless otherwise indicated.Example 1 Tetrahydrofuran 50 ml was placed in the autoclave and 5.0 mmol of the tantalum pentachloride was dissolved in the solvent. Next, 0.20 moles of methyl oxirane propylene oxide and 12.5 mmol of pyridine were added sequentially. The autoclave was sealed and briefly purged with carbon dioxide. While continuously stirring the mixture, the autoclave was heated to a temperature of 600C and subsequently charged with carbon dioxide to a total pressure of 34.5 bar gauge 500 psig .The reaction was continued for 5 hours at which time a sample was drawn and analyzed by IR spectrophotometry and NMR. The results are reported in Table I. Examples A to E and Examples 2 to 10 Examples A to E are controls which illustrate the significance of using specific combinations of a transition metal complex and a Lewis base. When either the metal complex or the base is used alone in the process, the yield of product is negligible. Examples 2 to 10 illustrate the use of various transition metal complexes in combination with variousLewis bases. The percent yields were determined by NMR integration and no by products were observed. TheseExamples illustrate that the present invention is extremely selective, employs very mild conditions and has high yields. Comparing the percent product manufactured in the controls to those of Examples 1 to 10 illustrates the superior results of the latter over the former. The transition metal complex in Example 9 includes the cyclopentadienyl group.The result was an extremely high yield of product greater than 99 . Examples 8 and 10 illustrate that these catalytic systems are not limited to methyl oxirane propylene oxide since butylenyl oxirane butadiene monooxide and butylenyl dioxirane butadiene diepoxide are found to be excellent starting oxiranes as their use results in yields greater than 99 product.
