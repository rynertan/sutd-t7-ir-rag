# Ply separable absorbent paper sheet and process for its manufacture.

## Abstract
An improved process to produce a novel tissue which becomes ply separable during the papermaking process. In a first embodiment of the invention a two layered stratified web is formed, having a first layer 113a comprised of a relatively high consistency slurry of long papermaking fibers and a second layer 113b comprised of a lower consistency slurry of relatively short papermaking fibers. In a second embodiment of the invention, a stratified web having three layers is formed, comprised of well bonded layers separated by an interior barrier layer. These improved tissue products need not be creped from a creping roll with a doctor blade in order to exhibit ply separability, and they may be creped in a single step to form a finished product which is creped all the way through.
