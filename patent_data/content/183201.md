# APPARATUS AND MEANS FOR ALTERING SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF A DIGITAL IMAGE BY POLYNOMIAL INTERPRETATION USING SETS OF ARITHMETIC PROCESSORS

## Abstract
A set of two processors operates on image pixel data using polynomial interpolation to generate pixel data for a spatially varied image. Image data is first stored in a buffer memory, and constants used in the polynomial interpolation are stored in a constants memory. One processor operates on the data from the buffer memory using constants from the constants memory, and the interpolated data is then stored in a display memory. The second processor controls the interpolation process by addressing the memories for the retrieval and storage of data.
