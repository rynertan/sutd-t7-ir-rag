## Description
Removing Siccative Coatings from Substrates. This invention relates to removing siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith. More particularly, the invention is concerned with an aqueous alkaline solution and processes employing it for stripping siccative coatings from metallic substrates. The term siccative coatings is used herein in its accepted meaning i.e. to embrace protective and or decorative coatings of the kind which when applied in liquid form to a substrate form a film thereon which adheres to and dries on the surface to form the coating. Examples of such siccative coatings are shellac varnishes, phenolic varnishes, paints of the drying oil types, cathodic electrodeposition paints, and paints which fall into the classes of alkyds, modified alkyds, modified phenolics, modified melamines, baked phenolics, epoxyresins, polyurethanes, silicones, acrylics, vinyls, and the like. Although the present invention has broader applicability, it will be described in connection with the stripping of siccative coatings from metal substrates, such as steel panels. There are many known compositions intended for removing siccative coatings from a wide variety of substrates, including wood and metals. Such compositions are useful in very diverse fields, ranging from furniture stripping or other generally similar home restoration applications all the way through a variety of industrial uses, such as in the automotive industry where siccative coatings applied during manufacture to protect various component parts must be removed prior to final painting and finishing. Perhaps the simplest of all stripping compositions are those which essentially consist of an aqueous alkaline solution, which can be used at high temperatures, usually a rolling boil. Alkaline stripping compositions of this kind are believed to function by breaking ester or ether linkages, which hold the polymer units of the paint film together, forming the corresponding soaps.This however is a relatively slow procedure, in which alkaline base is consumed, and contaminants are formed in the composition. It is possible to improve the effectiveness of aqueous alkaline solutions by adding thereto a wetting agent, which will accelerate the stripping operation by penetrating or permeating the paint film subsequent to partial removal thereof by degradation. Further improvements can be achieved by the incorporation of detergents and emulsifiers, which will accelerate the stripping process by deterging and emulsifying or solubilizing plasticizer and unpolymerized binder in the paint film. From what has been said above it should already be clear that when removing siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith the stripper composition employed will desirably be one which acts in one or more of the following ways to break ester or ether linkages using strong alkali to deterge and emulsify plasticizer or other components of lower molecular weights with appropriate surfactants to permeate cracks and fissures in the paint, especially through, voids or around pigment particles by a wetting out action to dissolve water soluble solvent in resinous polymers, to facilitate permeation to dissolve soaps formed by reaction with the alkali, using primary alcohols and gycols to avoid having these soaps hinder further reaction and to break the bond between the substrate and the paint film by whatever means possible, including superficial action on the sub strate by use of sequestrants.The stripper composition moreover should preferably be one which will penetrate the paint film rapidly, and with only limited disintegration of the film. The aqueous alkaline compositions discussed above, which are employed at elevated temperatures and are therefore often referred to as hot stripper compositions , generally are effective in removing most siccative finishes but they are quite ineffective in removing cathodic electrodeposition paints, and not particularly effective in removing carbon to carbon bond s. Penetration and bond breaking mechanisms are of primary importance with acrylic and vinyl paints, and the paint tends to be sheeted off with little disintegration. It has however already been discovered that if furfuryl alcohol is added to such hot stripper compositions they become effective to remove acrylic and vinyl paints as well as cathodic electrodeposition paints. It appears that the furfuryl alcohol somehow activates the composition so that it penetrates the paint film, allowing attack on the bonds between the substrate and the paint film.Another such composition activating compound is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. It has moreover been found that a combination of these two activators is more effective than either one of them alone. Another material which has been used in stripping compositions is an alkoxylated furfuryl alcohol. There are however problems about the use of these known activated hot stripper compositions.Above all, with continued use the activator is lost as it is boiled off. Furfuryl alcohol for instance forms an azeotrope with water, and the boiling point of that azeotrope falls within the operative temperature range for the hot stripper composition.Therefore, either the bath of composition must be dumped and a fresh bath made up, or the furfuryl alcohol and water lost as the azeotrope boils off must be replaced either continuously or at least periodically. We however have now found that it is possible to formulate a hot stripper composition which both is effective and has an increased bath life, and which moreover is particularly effective in the stripping of electrodeposited paint films. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an aqueous alkaline stripper composition, for use at elevated temperatures to remove siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith, comprising one or more alkaline compounds in a concentration such as to impart a pH of about 9.5 or more to the composition, together with an effective amount of at least two of the following three activator materials i tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and furfuryl and or tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol ethoxylates of the general formulaeEMI4.1 EMI5.1 wherein m and n, which may be the same or different, each represent the average degree of ethoxylation in the respective ethoxylates, and each of them lies in the range of from about 0.5 to about 10. As should be apparent, the average degree of ethoxylation represented respectively by m and n is in each case the number of moles of ethylene oxide per mole of the alcohol reacted and unreacted in the reaction product of ethylene tide with either furfuryl alcohol or tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.Thus for example when m or n is 1, the reaction product will be a mixture containing predominantly monc ethoxylated furfuryl or tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol tAut also small amounts of the unreacted alcohol and of polyethoxylated alcohol s . When m or n is a fraction less than 1, relatively larger quantities of unreacted alcohol will be present in the mixture whereas when m or n is greater than 1, relatively larger quantities of polyethoxylated alcohol s will be present. All the ingredients of the aqueous stripper composition must naturally be present in concentrations effective to remove the siccative coating from a substrate coated therewith. The ingredients will preferably be present in concentrations. effec tive to strip cathodic electrodeposition paint from a substrate coated therewith in a period within the range of from about 5 seconds to about 1 hour, working at a composition temperature in the range of from about 1800 to about 2200F approx. 820 140 C . As will emerge below, it appears that the unique combination of ingredients in the compositions of this invention together exert synergistic effects. As will be further explained subsequently, the compositions will preferably also contain a sequestering agent in an amount effective substantially to prevent precipitation, and or a composition stabilizing compound, selected from the group consisting of aliphatic primary alcohols, aliphatic secondary alcohols, alkylamines and mixtures thereof, in an amount effective substantially to prevent separation of the composition upon standing, and or one or more surfactants at a concentration of about 0.5 to about 20 g l. While effective compositions may be formulated that do not contain any of the aforementioned, it is preferred that one or more of these three kinds of optional additives should be present in the hot stripper compositions of this invention. The total concentration of the activator materials i iii present should preferably be at least about 7 g l, with at least two of these activator materials being each present in a concentration of at least about 2.5 g l. The alkaline compound s for use in the compositions of this invention may be any of the compounds known to the art that produce a strongly alkaline solution when dissolved in water. Preferably, the alkaline compound is supplied in the form of a compound or a mixture of compounds selected fron the group consisting of alkali metal and ammonium hydroxides, carbonates, silicates and phosphates, as well as amines. We particularly prefer to employ an alkali metal hydroxide or a mixture of two or more alkali metal hydroxides, and above all a mixture of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The alkaline compound s must be present in the aqueous alkaline composition of this invention in a concentration effective to impart a pH to the composition in the range of from about 9.5 to about 14 , and preferably in the range of from about 12 to about 14 . Generally speaking, the concentration of the alkaline compound and thus the pH value of the composition should be greater when the composition is employed at lower temperatures than when working at higher temperatures. For most purposes we have found that the concentration of alkaline compound s in the composition should be at least about 80 g l, and more preferably in the range of from about 150 to about 350 g l. One of the essential activator ma terials amongst the ingredients of the compositions of the present invention is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol hereinafter for brevity referred to as THFA . As already previously explained, it was known to use this material in stripper compositions, even indeed in combination with furfuryl alcohol but as will be seen from the test data reported below, we have found that the use of THFA in combination with the ethoxylated form of furfuryl alcohol yields improved results. The effectiveness of a composition containing both the ethoxylated material described below and THFA in stripping siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith has been found to be greater than that of a composition containing either of the ingredients in equivalent amounts, thus evidencing a synergistic action.THFA is preferably used at a concentration of at least about 2.5 g l, especially at a concentration in the range of from about 2.5 to about 200 g l, and above all at a concentration in the range of from about 4 to about 100 g l. The inclusion of the ethoxylate s i and or ii above exhibits certain definite advantages.They do not form an azeotrope with water as does furfuryl alcohol and they therefore do not become rapidly depleted from a working bath by nonfunctional mechanisms. Because the ethoxylated material remains in the bath, the stripper cbmposition displays an increased effectiveness more coating stripped volume of composition and thus one achieves a longer bath life. Indeed, we have found that a typical hot stripper composition of this invention can be used to strip siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith for a significantly extended period, perhaps two to three times longer than is possible with otherwise comparable compositions instead containing either furfuryl alcohol alone or furfuryl alcohol together with tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. A preferred ethoxylate for use in the compositions of this invention is the reaction product of furfuryl alcohol with ethylene oxide wherein m is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 1.5.Particularly preferred is such a product in which m is from about 0.85 to about 1.08. Another preferred ethoxylate for use in the compositions of this invention is the reaction product of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol with ethylene oxide wherein n is in the range of from about 3 to about 8. The ethoxylate s used in the composition must naturally be present in an effective concentration, which will depend on the type of siccative coating to be removed, as well as on the thickness of the coating. Higher concentrations are generally required to remove siccative coatings such as a cathodic electrodeposition paint than are required to remove ones such as an alkyd paint. The ethoxylate will preferably be present in a concen tration effective in a fresh composition, i.e.that has not previously been used to strip siccative coatings to remove cathodic electrodeposition paint from a substrate coated therewith in a period within the range of from about 5 seconds to about 1 hour, at a composition temperature in the range of from about 1800 to about 220 0F approx. 82 104 C . For most purposes we have found that the ethoxylated material should be present in a concentration of at least about 5 g l, and prefer ably within the range of from about 5 to about 200 g l. Particularly preferred concentrations are in the range of from about 10 to about 100 g l, and above all from about 20 to about 50 g l. The addition of a sequestering agent to the compositions of this invention has been found to be very advantageous, since its presence ensures that the composition may be effectively employed regard less of the hardness of the water used to formulate it, without generally experiencing precipitation of the calcium and magnesium ions that cause water hardness and more surprisingly, its presence addi tionally improves the ability of the compositions to remove siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith. While we do not wish to be limited by any theoretical considerations, we assume that this can perhaps be explained upon the basis that the sequestering agent aids in breaking the bond between the substrate and the paint film, through super ficial action on the substrate. Representative of the sequestering agents which may be employed singly or in admixture in the compositions of this invention are hydroxy carboxylic acids such as gluconic, citric and tartaric acids, aminopolycarboxylic acids such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and various commercial preparations such as Belzak AC, manufactured by BelzakCorporation. The currently preferred sequestering agents are gluconic acid and or Belzak AC. The sequestering agent should preferably be added in a concentration which will be effective substantially to prevent precipitation of the calcium and magnesium ions that are the primary cause of water hardness. Generally speaking, greater amounts of the sequestering agent will therefore be required when the hardness of the water is high than when it is low. For most purposes we have found that the concentration of sequestering agent should be at least about 1 g l, and preferably in the range of from about 1 to about 100 g l. A composition stabilizing compound can also with advantage be incorporated in the compositions of this invention. Such composition stabilizing compounds include aliphatic primary alcohols, aliphatic secondary alcohols, alkylamines and mixtures thereof. Without limiting ourselves by any theoretical considerations, we think that such stabilizing compounds probably act as a secondary solvent, miscible in water, which functions to provide a more uniform solution that will not separate upon standing. The stabilizing compounds are believed also to increase the effectiveness of the composition by functioning to dissolve soaps that are formed by reaction of the siccative coating with the alkaline compound, thereby rendering the soaps ineffective to hinder further such reaction. The composition stabilizing compound will preferably be one or a mixture of more than one of the following, namely methanol, monoethanolamine, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and n butyl amine. The most preferred stabilizing compounds are methanol, monoethanolamine, diethylene glycol and n butyl amine. The composition stabilizing compound will preferably be present in a concentration effective substantially to prevent separation of the composi tion of the invention. For most purposes we have found that the composition stabilizing compound should be added in a concentration of at least about 10 g l, and preferably in the range of from about 50 to about 200 g l. Although not essential, the composition of this invention will preferably also contain one or more surfactants or wetting agents, which presumably may serve to deterge and emulsify plasticizers or other components of lower molecular weights in the film of the siccative coating, thereby promoting removal thereof. There appears to be nothing critical about the choice of surfactant or wetting agent employed and amphoteric, non ionic and anionic surfactants may all be employed. Currently preferred surfactants are Miranol JEM Concentrate, manufactured by Miranol Chemical Co. and Sulfonate OA 5, manufactured by Cities Service Co. Sul fon ate OA 5 is a trademark for an anionic wetting agent said to be sulphonated oleic acid, sodium salt . The composition will preferably contain a con centration of at least about 0.5 g l of one or more surfactants particularly advantageous concentrations are in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20 g l. Preferred compositions in accordance with this invention are those which contain an alkaline component in a concentration within the range of from about 150 to about 350 g l, the alkaline component in turn comprising from 3.5 to about 350 g l of sodium hydroxide and or from 3.5 to about 350 g l of potassium hydroxide, said composition also containing from about 1 to about 100 g l of a sequestering agent, from about 50 to about 100 g l of one or more composition stabilizing compounds being methanol, monoethanolamine, diethylene glycol and or n butyl amine, from about 2.5 to about 200 g l of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and from about 5 to about 200 g l of an ethoxylate ii being the reaction product of furfuryl alcohol and ethylene oxide wherein m is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 1.5. In these preferred compositions the ethoxylate ii will desirably be one in which m is in the range of from about 0.85 to about 1.08. They will also advantageously include one or more surfactants in a concentration in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20 g l. According to another aspect, this invention also provides a process for stripping siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith, in which the coated substrate is contacted with a stripper composition in accordance with the present invention as herein described, at a composition temperature and for a time sufficient to remove the siccative coating from the substrate. The process of this invention displays itself to best advantage when the siccative coating being stripped is a cathodically electrodeposited paint film. Siccative coatings may be stripped from sub strates coated therewith by contacting the coated substrate with the hot stripper composition at elevated temperatures, preferably when maintained at a rolling boil. The compositions of the invention are for most purposes best employed at a temperature of at least about 1400F 600C , and especially in the range of from about 1800 to about 2200 F approx. 82 1040C . The minimum period of contact between the composition and the substrate which will be sufficient to remove the siccative coating from the substrate will depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the siccative coating, the number of substrates previously contacted with the composition, the temperature of the composition, the total coated surface area of the substrate in contact with the composition, the thickness of the siccative coating, and the concentration of various of the constituents. Generally speaking, we have found that contact times effective to remove the siccative coating from a substrate coated therewith will be within the range of from about 5 seconds up to about 1 hour at a temperature within the range of from about 1800 to 2200F approx. 82 1040C for a fresh composition, i.e. a composition that has not previously been used to remove the siccative co atings.It should be borne in mind that the contact period required to remove the siccative coating will tend to increase when the temperature of the composition is decreased, when the number of coated substrates previously contacted with the composition is increased, when the surface area of coated substrate in contact with the composition is increased, when the thickness of the coating to be stripped is increased, and or when the concentration of the compositionactivating compound of the invention is decreased. The coated substrates to be stripped may be contacted with the compositions of the invention according to any of the methods known to the art.Generally speaking, the coated substrate to be stripped will be immersed in a bath of the composition. Once the siccative coating has been removed, the substrate will preferably be rinsed with water and then dried. The hot stripper composition may be initially formulated as an aqueous concentrate, which subsequently is diluted with water to make up the aqueous alkaline composition of the invention. Such an aqueous concentrate should be so formulated that when it is added to water at a concentration in the range of from about 10 to about 99 by volume, it will make up an aqueous alkaline hot stripper composition with a pH within the range of from about 9.5 to about 14 , which will be effective at elevated temperatures to remove siccative coatings from substrates coated therewith. The aqueous concentrate will preferably be added to water at a concentration of from about 40 to about 60 by volume and when so added the alkaline component therein will desirably be present in a concentration which imparts a pH in the range of from about 12 to about 14 to the resultant composition. For most purposes we have found that the alkaline component should preferably constitute from about 10 to about 50 wt. of the concentrate. The THFA and the ethoxylate s should also be present in the concentrate in such concentrations that the hot stripper composition produced by diluting the concentrate will contain concentrations of these ingredients which will be effective to remove cathodic electrodeposition paint from a substrate coated therewith in a period in the range of from about 5 seconds to about 1 hour, at a composition temperature in the range of from about 1800 to 2200F approx. 82 104 0C . We have found that for most purposes THFA typically can constitute at least about 1 wt. , and preferably in the range of from about 1 to about 20 wt. , of the concentrate. The concentrate may also optionally but desirably contain one or more of the following other components, each as previously defined herein, namely a sequestering agent in concentration of at least about 0.1 wt. and preferably in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. a compositionstabilizing compound in a concentration of at least about 1 wt. , and preferably in the range of from about 1 to about 20 wt. , and one or more surfactants, at a concentration of at least about 0.1 wt. , and preferably in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. . Particularly preferred concentrates contain from about 10 to about 85 wt. water from about 10 to about 50 wt. of an alkaline component, which in turn comprises from 0.5 to about 50 wt. of sodium hydroxide and from 0.5 to about 50 wt. of potassium hydroxide from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. of a sequestering agent from about 1 to about 20 wt. of composition stabilizing compound s being one or more of the following, namely methanol, monoethanolamine, diethylene glycol and n butyl amine from about 1 to about 20 wt. of the reac tion product of furfuryl alcohol and ethylene oxide being an ethoxylate ii wherein m is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 1.5, and preferably in the range of from about 0.85 to about 1.08.This preferred concentrate will moreover also advantageously contain one or more surfactants, at a concentration in the range of from about 0.1 to about 10 wt. Even though the ethoxylate s included in the compositions may properly be regarded as nonvolatile when compared with furfuryl alcohol a property which as already stated results in an increased effectiveness and bath life relative to conventional compositions containing furfuryl alcohol these ethoxylate s nevertheless are gradually depleted during continuous use of the composition. It does therefore become desirable to replenish a bath of the composition after a certain period of use.The point in time at which replenishment becomes necessary may be readily determined by monitoring the period needed to strip a siccative coating from a substrate as the activator is depleted, this period will increase, until eventually it will reach a stripping period that is commercially unacceptable. In this way one can readily determine when the addition of a replenishing composition is required. We have found that when replenishing the composition, it is generally speaking best to restore the concentration of the ethoxylate s to about the initial concentration without increasing the concentration of alkaline compound beyond its concentration in the initial composition. The replenisher composition of the invention will therefore generally contain a higher concentration of the ethoxylate s and a lower concentration of the alkaline compound than may b desirable in the hot stripper composition itself. A replenisher composition suitable for use in replenishing the hot stripper composition of this invention will frequently contain about 1 to about 200 g l of the alkaline compound, sufficient to impart a pH to the replenisher of about 9.5 to about 14 , preferably about 12 to about 14 , as well as from about 50 to about 200 g l of the ethoxylate s and at least about 50 g l, and preferably from about 50 to about 200 g l, of the THFA. Although not essential, the replenisher composition will preferably contain one or more of the following previously defined components, namely a sequestering agent in a concentration of from about 2.5 to about 100 g l a composition stabilizing compound in a concentration of from about 10 to about 200 g l and one or more surfactants, in a concentration of from about 1 to about 100 g l. In passing it may be observed that, although the primary utility of the replenisher composition is naturally in the replenishment of the hot stripper composition of this invention, yet we have found that the replenisher composition may also be effectively employed to replenish those prior art compositions which contain furfuryl alcohol and or THFA.

Composition 5 was added to such compositions, after continuous use thereof, in order to extend the operability of such compositions. The next group of examples represent a series of comparative tests, which exemplify the synergistic properties of hot stripper compositions within the scope of the present invention. As a first step a control composition was prepared with the following ingredients CONTROL COMPOSITION CIngredients by WeightWater 26.5Sodium hydroxide 50 34.0Potassium hydroxide 50 34.0Amphoteric surfactant Miranol JEM Conc. 0.5Methanol 5.0 100 .0 Control Composition C was used as the basis for preparing the various other compositions identified in Table 5 below and those other compositions, as well as Composition C itself, were used to strip the paint from steel panels prepainted with cathodically electrodeposited green paint films having thicknesses of 1 to 1.5 mil. The painted panels were immersed in the freshly prepared compositions referred to in Table 5, and maintained therein until 100 of the film was stripped. The times required to accomplish this were recorded and are reported in Table 5. The compos tions were then subjected to a rolling boil for six hours, and thereafter were used to strip the paint from steel panels painted like those referred to above.The times needed to strip 100 f the paint films from the panels were recorded, and are reported inTable 5. The ethoxylate used in various of the compositions referred to in Table 5 was the reaction product of ethylene oxide with THFA, of general formula iii above wherein n is about 1.5, and is referred to in the Table as THFA ETO .

The loss of effectiveness of a composition including furfuryl alcohol as it is subjected to elevated temperature for prolonged periods is exemplified by the results shown for the compositions of ExamplesC 6 and C 7. The compositions of Example Nos.9 and 10 show the improved results that can be achieved by utilizing higher amounts of various of the activating ingredients.
