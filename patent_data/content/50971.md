# Heart valves having edge guided occluders.

## Abstract
Heart valves have pivotal occluders or valve members 15, 115 165 which are guided between their open and closed positions by projections 35, 135 635 extending inward from the annular body 13, 113 613 and inter engaging with complementary notches 33, 133 163 in the peripheries of the occluders 15, 115 615 . Protuberances 45, 49, 55, 145 645, 149 649 associated with the projections 35, 135 635 cooperate to define the pivotal axis, serve as open and closed position stops, and retain the valve members 15, 115 615 within the valve body 13, 113 613 .
