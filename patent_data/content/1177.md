## Description
improvement in or relating to trai3รง rs and beame fen chassis construction.This invention relates to commercial vehicles and more particularly to beams for chassis constructiora suitable for forming a semi trailer with a single longitudinal beam and to a trailer having such a single longitadin beam. Light boat trailers are known to us which emop oy a Dingde draw beam of box section. Conventional bo section beams are only suitable for carrying relatively light loads and accordingly heavy goods trailers for carrying example 3 to 30 tons employing a single longitudinal beam hav not until now been a practical proposition.The main advantage of the invention is that it provides a beam of nxtremely strong construction but which is still light enough to permit application t chassis construction. In a major application it permits the construction of a heavy goods trailer with a single longitudinally extending beam.According to the invention there is provided a chassis beam provided with internal reinforcing members distri buted therealong and extending between opposite sides of the beam. The beam may be of substantially box section.The reinforcing members may extend contiguously between sides adjacent said opposite sides of a beam of substantially box section. Alternatively the reinforcing members may extend part way between and intermediately of sides adjacent said opposite sides. The reinforcing members may be tubular e.g. of round or rectangular cross section and may be of transverse xternal cross section substantially equal to the internal width of the box section.Alternatively, the reinforcing members may comprise portions of conventional girder section e.g. L or 11 section.The beam may comprise upper and lower strips with the reinforcing members secured therebetween by welding.Side strips may be secured to the upper and lower strips by welding along adjacent edges to complete a substantially box section beam.The box section may be subdivided to provide a tank for receiving fuel oil or water or to act as a pressure reservoir for air for a brake servo assistance system and or for a pressure supported wheel suspension system.The invention also includes a trailer or semi trailer having a single longitudinally extending chassis beam of construction substantially as hereinbefore defined.In order that the invention and its various other preferred features may be understood more easily some embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a vertical cross sectional view taken longitudinally of a trailer draw beam constructed in accordance witn the in at Figure 2 is a cross sectioral w aken line X X of figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross Sectional view taen n tue line Y Y of figure 2 Figure 4 is a cross sectional view w milar to Figure 5 showing an alternative arrangemset of the Fabrication of the beam Figure 5 is a horizontal cross sectional view similar to Figure 2 showing an alt rnative eon struction of beam Figure 6 is a horizontal cross sect onal view similar to figure 2 showing another alternative constructio of beam Figure 7 is a cross sectional view taken longatud inally and horizontally of an alternative construst ion of bean Figure 8 is a transverse cross section oi yet another possible construction of beam Figure 9 is a plan view showing part of a trailer employing a single longitudinal beam in accordance with the invention, and Figure 10 is a side view of the trailer of Figure 6The trailer draw beams of Figures 1 to 4 comprisas upper and lower strips 10 and 11 respectively of steal plate between which reinforcing members 12, formed of r qual length sections of steel pipe, are evenly spaced apart along the length of the strips 10 and 11 and are welded thereto by welds 13.Side strips 14, 15 of steel plate of width slightly larger than the length of the. rein forcing member 12 may be welded at their edges to the edges of the upper and lower strips 10 and 11 by means of deep welds 16 to complete a box section construction.Howerver, the side strips are not essential to the contruction of a robust bean and may be dispensed with if desared.The beam so fabricated provides an extremelv strong yet conparatively lightweight construction. The reinforcing members 12 can be arranged to be in contact one with another along the length of the beam and if sufficiently large in diameter can have additional internal welds where they join to upper and lower strips 10 and 11.It will be appreciated that in the case of box section construction for the beam the provision of the side strips after the interconnection of the reinforcement members and upper and lower strips permits access for the welding equiwlent. The construction of Figure 4 employs reinforcing members 12 which have a cross sectional diameter less than the internal width of the box section and leave a channel on each side of the beam for routing of for example cables.Although the construction illustrated employs pipe of circular cross section it will be appreciated that pipes of other cross sectional shape could be employed. In addition although each pipe is shown to be of diameter equal to the width of the box section a plurality of smaller pipes could be disposed side by side transversely of the box section. The drawings of Figures 5 to 8 show four possible alternative types of reinforcing members which may be employed.In Figure 5 sections 17 of steel angle of L shaped cross section are employed and these are arranged side by side so as to traverse the width of the box section as will be clear from the drawing and are again welded to top and bottom strips not shown of the box section.In Figure 6 l1 section steel girder sections 18 are employed the uprights of the II extending transversely of the box section at right angles to its length. The sections 18 are again welded to the top and bottom strips not shown of the box section.Sections of many ether standard girder ercse shapes can be employed instead of L et s ape and draw bars reinforced with such sections ere to fall within the scope of this inventionThe beam of Figure 7 is basically of having upper and lower ends 20 and an upright 21.Reinforcing members 22 are in this case fermen of sner lengths of steel pipe in this case of circnlar eross section which have been cut in half on cheir longetudinal axis to provide lengths of semi circular cross section These reinforcing members are of length equal to the distancP between the ends 20 and to the upright 21 a1d can be staggered on opposite sides of the upright as shown or can be oppositely disposed in alignment. Option side plates 23 can then be welded to the ends 20.The beam of Figure 8 employs reinforicng members 25 which are of plate like form and which extend between a tubular member 26 and the upper, the lower and side plates 0 a box section beam. The tubular member 66 is useful for example for routing cables for control of vehicle functions. The reinforcing members 25 may oe forced by four continuous strips which extend along the tubular member 26 or alternatively a plurality of plate like elements can be provided in succession along the tubular member.Although the beam constructions described have employed reinforcing members formed of sections of for example pipe or girder section extending axially at right ongles to the upper and lower plates of the be with a view to providing maximum strength in the downward direction, similar constructions in which the reinforcing members extend with their axes at right angles to side plates of the beam can be employed. The drawings of Figures 9 and 10 show part of a trailer for articulation to a tractor unit and having a single longitudinal beam 3 constituted by a beam as previously described. The single beam has in this case four wheels each pivotally mounted on the beam by means of a wishbone assembly 32 which is directly and non pivotally connected to a stub axle 33 and is equipped with an independent suspension system which in this case comprises a diaphragm or billows 34 containing pressurised air which diaphragm or bellows acts between the wishbone assembly 22 and a laterally extending bearer 25. The beans as previously described can have their interior subdivided by panels to provide one or more tanks for retaining a liquid e.g. fuel oil or a pressure medium e.g. air for operating a brake servo or for pressurising the suspension system. In the latter case the pressure tank can be adapted for connection to a compressor of a tractor unit. It may be necessary to provide holes through the reinforcing members to ensure that liquid or pressurised fluid can pass freely between reinforcing members where a plurality of reinforcing members lie within one tank.
