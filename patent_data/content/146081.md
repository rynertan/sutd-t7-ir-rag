# METHOD OF MAKING A PRESSURE VESSEL WITH AN ANTI CORROSION COATING, AND VESSEL OBTAINED THEREBY

## Abstract
The affected technical field is that of pressure vessels, and the invention relates to a method of making a pressure vessel with an anti corrosion coating, and a vessel obtained thereby, which are made such as to avoid the danger of dis bonding. The solution consists of a method comprising a first step of deposition by welding on the layer of base material of the shroud 1 a layer 2 of low carbon steel, and a second step of deposition by welding on the low carbon steel layer, a layer 3 of anti corrosion material.
