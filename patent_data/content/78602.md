# Multiple orifice bushing.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing glass filaments 15 in which the bushing bottom plate 12 has tips 20 depending therefrom and each tip 20 has a plurality of orifices from which glass filaments 15 are drawn. The tips 20 flood individually on start up or during operation, and the flood results in a single composite filament being formed from the orifices of that tip. The composite filament beads down rapidly and is subsequently separated into individual fila ments 15 by the use of a fluid spray directed against the composite filament at the tip lower face. The fluid spray is utilized to momentarily quench the composite filament and is terminated once separation occurs. Subsequent filament drawing is accomplished without the use of a cooling fluid and by the use of known heat exchange means, e.g., a flow of cooling gas.
