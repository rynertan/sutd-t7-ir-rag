## Description
AUDIO AND VIDEO DISC RECORDS AND A METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THEREOF.This invention relates to audio and video disc records and to a pressing technique there for.The idea of pressing records to incorporate graphic material is by no means new, and in recent years picture disc longplaying and single records have been produced by two similar techniques. These are known in the trade as the M.S. Schallplatten technique, or the Damont Records Warner Brothers technique.Both of these press the record in the one operation. They require the graphics to be litho printed on special Kiln dried paper which is incorporated into the record during pressing. Both techniques can only be carried out on manual presses artery slow speed. Techniques of the above type are disclosed in various Patent specifications for example GoB 675,679, G.B.391,457 and G.B. 333,175.A major disadvantage of both techniques is the poor audio quality of the finished product. A major cause of this is the very thin layer of clear plastic which is laminated to the printed paper and bears the audio grooves. This thin layer is unable to prevent distortions in the paper and allows for only a very shallow audio groove which is capable of reproducing only a limited frequency range and dynamic response and is therefore of restricted sound quality. The present invention aims to produce improv ed audio and video disc records which may incorporate printed or other decorative material, and which have audio or video reproductive qualities much improved compared with these earlier attempts. The present invention achieves this by providing an audio and or video record disc comprising two layers of plastics material, each layer carrying an audio and or video recording track on its externally facing surface, its other surface being substantially flat and being joined to the other layer over its other surface, graphic or other material being sandwiched between said other surfaces of the two layers.The invention also proposes a method of manufacturing an audio and or video disc record comprising the steps of separately pressing two discs of plastics material which incorporate an audio and or video recording track on one surface only thereof, and subsequently joining the two discs over their other surfaces while incorporating graphic or other material between the two discs.The invention will now be described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a cross section of an audio disc record according to the invention Fig. 2 shows an enlarged cross section through such a record Fig. 3 shows an enlarged cross section of the perimeter of the cqnventional long playing audio record Figure 4 shows the cross section of the perimeter of one disc of an audio disc record according to the invention Figure 5 shows the cross section of a modification of the disc of Figure 4 Figure 6a shows an apparatus for the adhesive edge welding of two discs each having the cross section shown in Figure 5 Figure 6b shows an enlarged view of a record being adhesive welded by the apparatus of Figure 6a Figure 7 shows the cross section of a further modifisatiqn of the disc of Figure 4 Figure 8 shows an apparatus for welding two discs each having the cross section shown in Figure 7 andFigure 9 shows a disc having liquid material between the two discs.The disc record shown in Figure 1 has a first disc. 10 and a second disc 11. each carrying audio recording grooves 12 on one surface 13.The two discs are attached to one another by any suitable adhesive which does not cause distortion of the external surfaces, or by ultra sonic, laser R.F. radio frequency heated tool, adhesive solvent such as T.H.F. or ultra violet cured silk screen or roller coated adhesive welding. The inner surfaces i4 of the two discs have random grooves thereon, which do not represent audio records but which serve only to accommodate and equlise the uneven flow of fluid plastic which might result from the audio grooved side having a larger surface area and having greater resistance to flow than the snioothside during pressing. These grooves are only necessary if uneven material flow cannot be overcome by standard temperature control practices. Between the two discs which together forum the sandwich is positioned graphic or other decorative material 15. This may be simply printed paper or other dry material such as a plastic film a diffraction grating replica, lace, dried flowers, etc., or a liquid such as liquid crystal temperature and or pressure sensitive , silicone fluid oil, liquid dye or material of almost any viscosity. The two discs 10, 11 are formed from a completely clear plastic, of which a suitable formulation is now commercially available.The weight of each disc, of which two are required to make one complete audio disc record, about 80 90 grams, is about 30 grams less than a conventional long playing record. Consequently, the resultant audio disc record is a little heavier than a conventional long playing record and a little bit thicker than other picture discs . Nevertheless, such a record can be played on almost any type of record player and will not deteriorate in quality any faster than a conventional pressing. The pressing can be carried out on any standard pressing machine, including existing automatic pressing machines, and requires only minor alterations to the pressing insert profile, time and temperature operating cycles or injecting mould cavity profile. There is no loss whatsoever in audio quality, since the two discs with their audio grooves are formed independently of the decorative material lying between them. The speed with which records can be produced is considerably faster than both the existing techniques for producing picture discs .As can be seen from Figures 3 and 4, there needs to be a change in the edge of the pressings since the enlarged thickness on the edge of a conventional long playing record is replaced in the present case by an enlarged thickness on one side surface only of the two discs fondling the record. Figure 3 shows the edge 18 of a conventional long playing record. Figure 4 shows a cross section of the edge of one of the two discs for the new disc records. This has a projection 20 on the surface 13. On the inner surface 14 the disc is preferably recessed slightly at 21 forming a circumferential shoulder 22. The recess stops short of the centre of the disc so that when the two discs are assembled for connection together, an annular chamber having a thickness of about 4 thousandths of an inch is formed within which the graphic or other decorative material 15 is housed.Figure 5 shows a modification of the disc of Figure 4 which is suitable when assembly is to be carried out through solvent adhesive welding such as a ToHoF tetrahydrofuran based adhesive extruded through a canula fed from a time and flow controlled adhesive reservoir once the rotating edge of two record halves clamped together. The disc edge has a level portion 25.When the disc is mated with another disc havinga similar level portion, they together create a groove which can be filled with adhesive solvent and which also fulfils the purpose of helping the canula to track accurately while administering the adhesive.Figures 6a and 6b show an apparatus suitable for adhesive welding two discs of the type shown in Figure 5. A flow gun 51 injects a metered amount of solvent adhesive to a canula 50 which directs the adhesive into the V shaped groove 54 formed by bevel portion 25. The record is held in between driven plates 52,53, felt pads 55, 56 being used to protect the surfaces of the record.The plates 52, 53 are driven by a motor 57. A hinged loading assembl 58 is pivotably mounted for rotation through approximately 150 into the open position shown in dashed lines in Figure 6a. in its olden poition it permits loading of record halves into the t PI cfl Lu. Figure 7 shows another modification of the disc of Figure 4 which is suitable if the two halves are to be welded by RadioFrquency R.F. or ultra sonic vibrations. When a disc is pressed by compression moulding or by injection moulding, excess vinyl escapes througll the mating surfaces of the mould and this is later trimmed off by turning the disc against a heated cutting tool. The excess material is called the flash . In Figure 7 this flash 23 is not totally trimmed off but about i to i of an inch of flash is left around the circumference of the disc.This flash is about 0.025 inches thick an ideal thickness for high frequency welding . The pressing or injection moulding machine must be adjusted in such a manner that it produced a flash that is almost flush with the smooth side of the disc.The disc is also provided with a shallow circumferential depressic 24. This depression improves the strength of the weld by forming a cavity which fills with molten plastic during welding.Figure 8 shows a welding apparatus for R.F. or ultra sonic welding the discs together, and illustrates how the flash 23 is used to facilitate the weld. An R,F. welding tool or ultra sonic horn 40 is shaped into a ring of the same diameter as the flash around the disc. The disc 11 is placed in the middle of the circular tool 40 smooth side upawrds so that the flash 23 contacts the tool and also supports the disc. The disc rests on a rubber mat 46 on the platt 47 of the welding machine. The insert 15 is then placed on top of the disc except in the case of liquid discs see figure 9 . The second disc 0 is then placed smooth side down wards on top of the insert 15. An upper tool 40 of similar design as the lower is brought down to contact the flash of the upper disc and power ultra sonic or radio frequency vibrations is transmitted through parts 42 of one or both of the tools. In the case of R.1. welding one of both tools may be preheated to below the melting temperature of the vinyl to promote a quicker and improved welding operation. The tools are so shaped that as the flash material melts it is forced by the tool inwards and into the mating surfaces of the discs including depressions 24. A cutting edge 41 on the tool slices away all unwanted material, The cutting away of the unwanted material in the same operation as welding is known as TearSealing and is standard practice in the packaging industry.Tools 40, 40 are supported by holding plates 48, 49. The advantage of R.F. or ultra sonic welding over solvent adhesive welding is speed and integrity of weld both of which are improved.However, due to the high cost of equipment these techniques are not suitable for low volume applications such as In Store assembly for personalised discs.Figure 9 illustrates a method of mass producing liquid discs.The records produced by this process contain a liquid insert such as liquid crystals or liquid colours made up of silicone fluids oils and dyes. This technique referred to as the membrane fill technique is based on the concept of first welding by R.F.or ultra sonics a sheet of thin PVC, acetate or similar film 30 of between 25 and 200 microns thickness to the smooth side of a disc 10 completely welding the membrane 30 around the centre hole 27 and approximately 350 degrees around the circumference.The welds are shown at 29o The remaining 10 degree gap 31 around the circumference is used for the introduction of the injection canula through which is pumped a metered quantity of the required liquid 28. After filling, the 10 degree gap is welded closed using a welding machine with an inclined table to avoid spillage Waste material unwanted parts of the PVC or acetate sheet is cut away in the same operation as welding using a tear seal, The second part of the record is then welded to the first part 10.The membrane 30 may be clear or coloured.Another method of producing liquid filled discs is as follows,A first disc 10 is held horizontally with its surface 14 uppermost, and a metered amount of liquid is dripped or poured on to this surface. A film or membrane 30 is then placed over disc 10 to form a seal with the edge or flash of the discO In this method the shape and size of membrane is not important as long as it completely covers disc 10. A further amount of liquid is then dripped or poured on to the membrane 30. The further liquid may be the same as the first liquid or may be a different one, for example one having a different colour.The second disc 11 is then placed over the membrane 30 with its surface 14 facing downwards. The edge of disc 10, 11 are then welded together so that a welded joint is formed between them and a liquid tight joint is formed between each of them and the membrane 30, Surpllls flash material may then be trimmed off portions of the membrane outside the discs are also removed at this stage,An advantage of this method over that described in connection withFigure 9 is that only one welding operation is needed. Further by using two liquids e.g. two types of pressure and or temperature sensitive liquid crystals, various decorative effects may be produced.The above embodiments of the invention employ discs having conventional analogue audio tracks and have improved audio reproductive qualities compared with existing picture discs.The invention may also be applied to digital audio discs0 The invention is also compatible with current developments in disc pressing such as the laser accessed video dise formats.The invention allows laser audio and video discs and other forms of sound and or vision carrying discs to contain graphic and other decorative material and or printed information or codes at present not possible using existing techniques.Discs pressed by the method of the present invention also exhibit a far greater resistance to warping than any other type of existing audio and or video disc as the joining together of two separately stressed layers causes an equalisation of strains much in the same way that the lamination of thin layers of wood with opposed grain creates a warp resistant board such as plywood or chip board. Another advantage of this invention is that as the pressing and assembly are two completely separate operations, they can be carried out at different times and or different places. This makes it possible to bulk press disc halves at one time and then supply them to retail or mail order outlets where customised inserts i.e. customer s own photographs, logos, messages etc can be inserted and the welding together of the two halves carried out.
