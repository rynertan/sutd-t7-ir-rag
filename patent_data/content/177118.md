# Fuel filter and dehydrator element and method of filtering and dehydrating fuel.

## Abstract
In a fuel filter and dehydrator element for example for use in an aviation fuel supply system, fuel is supplied to a coalescing layer 57 of material which coalesces water in the fuel into droplets. The fuel and water droplets are then passed to an absorptive layer 56 which absorbs at least some of the water droplets and as it becomes saturated reduces in permeability and thus causes a pressure drop. The fuel and any water remaining therein is then passed to further coalescing and absorptive layers 55, 54 which act similarly. As the first absorptive layer 56 approaches saturation, the pressure drop caused is reacted by the second coalescing layer 55 , which causes that layer to be compressed and thus water droplets therein are exhuded to the second absorptive layer 54 which thus also reduces in permeability and thus there is a further pressure drop across the whole element. Therefore, once the element becomes saturated with water it shuts off fuel flow more sharply than an element employing only one pair of layers. Further pairs of layers 46, 45 may be employed to produce a more marked effect.
