# Line trimmer for cutting vegetation.

## Abstract
A line trimmer for cutting vegetation has features to enable automatic advancement of line increments while rotating. The trimmer has a housing 13 with an aperture 17 on its periphery. A spool 39 coiled with a flexible cutting line 41 is located in the housing. The free end of the line extends out of the aperture into a cutting plane. A set of stop members 23 is located in the housing near the centre in a circular array. A link 31 is carried in the housing radially outward from the stop members. When the link is in contact with one of the members, the spool and housing are locked together for rotation. Increased centrifugal force urges the drive link outwardly, allowing the spool and housing to slip relative to each other to feed out additional line. Cam members 25 are located on the inner side of the housing outer wall. These cam members stop further slippage by forcing the link back into engagement with the stop mem bers.
