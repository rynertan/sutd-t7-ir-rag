## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to new and unique copolymer compositions, methods for handling said copolymers to mold or cast them into optical lenses, especially contact lenses or blanks from which contact lenses may be shaped, and to the buttons and lenses resulting therefrom. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel copolymer compositions having distinctly improved extended wear properties while providing wettability, mechanical stability and optical clarity essential for optical lenses including interoccular and contact lenses, or thef buttons and blanks from which such lenses may be shaped. The buttons or blanks can be formed by either conventional forming techniques, by injection molding or by compression casting. Furthermore, this invention concerns oxygen permeable copolymers from which contact lenses and the like can be produced which lenses have improved extended wear properties. In addition, these copolymers can be used to manufacture contact lenses by industry standard manufacturing techniques as well as by inject ion molding or casting which lenses can be cleaned with standard contact lens cleaning solutions without any special surface treatments to impart wettability. For purposes of the following discussion, this invention will be described in terms ol contact lenses although it is readily applicable to various optical lenses and other applications. So called hard contact lenses and compositions for fabricating them are well known in the art. The standard contact lens used for many years was fabricated from polymethyl methacrylate PMMA and achieved widespread use throughout the world, despite the tact that a PMMA lens is essentially impermeable to oxygen. The lack of oxygen at the inter face between the contact lens and the cornea will, after even short periodr of time, i.e., less than one day, cause discomfort to the wearer because of edema induced by the lack of oxygen at the surface of the cornea.Consequently, PMMA lenses must be removed at lest daily and prelerrably more often to expose the surface of the cornea to ambient atmospheric oxygen and thereafter replaced, a bothersome procedure. In an attempt to remedy these defects Inherent in standard PiMA contact lenses, the art has devised other copolymer contact lens compositions having improved oxygen permeability which allow the user to wear the lenses for longer periods of time, sometimes several days, before they must be removed for cleanlng. These oxygen permeable lenses are of two general types, the so called soft lens formed of the very flexible Hydrogel material and the so called hard permeable lens formed of a solid copolymer of methyl methacrylate with various comonomers.The hard permeable lens avoids certain problems associated with the so called soft lens, principally in its resistance to contamination and breakage, and provides ease of cleaning and resistance to surface scratching. Although the hard permeable contact lens compositions represented a marked improvement over standard PMMA polymers in terms of oxygen permeability, they nevertheless suffered certain disadvantages in comparison to standard PMMA lenses in terms of wettability, mechanical stability and chemical stability. Moreover, certain of the present day hard permeable copolymers require special surface pre treatment to improve wettability and or special lens treatment solutions which are used throughout the life of the lens to improve or maintain surface properties. Furthermore, the hard permeable copolymers are inherently brittle with the result that they frequently chip at their edges and break.Such chipping obviously creates a potential health hazard to the wearer and imposes a definite economic burden because they must be replaced. This invention will be best understood by reference to the prior art described in Keogh, U.S. 4,259,467, and Ratkowski et al, U.S. 4,419,505, and the several references cited therein. Further background Is available from Gaylord,U.S. 3,808,178 Ellis et al, U.S. 4,168,122 Ellis et al, U.S. 4,152,508 Novieky, U.S. 4,218,303 Novicky, U.S. 4,242,483 Neef, U.S. 4,306,042 and Poley, E.P. 75004. As is apparent from the art, a definite need exists for and it would be highly advantageous to provide a hard oxygen permeable contact lens composition, lenses manufactured thereof, and methods for manufacturing lenses or lens blanks buttons therefrom, all of which could provide contact lenses having at least the oxygen permeability characteristic exhibited by presently available hard permeable lenses, which would have improved wettability, and which would provide significant production economies, especially it such composition can be used to manufacture contact lenses or buttons therefor, using not only the standard procedures and equipment already known for manufacture of PMMA lenses, but using inject ion molding or casting in such a way that special surface pre treatments or periodic surface treatments to attain and maintain the desired surface properties are no longer required. Further, if such lens could also have the ability for extended wear, that is, permit the user to keep the lens in place for several weeks, up to a month or more, a major break through would be accomplished. This disclosure is based upon the discovery of lens copolymer compositions, lenses fabricated therefrom, and methods for manufacture ot lenses employing such compositions which achieve the aforedescribed break through in a remarkably unexpected fashion as will be readily discerned from a detailed reading of the following disclosure and examples thereof. Accordingly, a prime object of the present invention is to provide a new and Improved optical lens composition especially useful for the manufacture of contact lenses therefrom having excellent oxygen permeability, improved wettability, enhanced dimensional stability and extended werability. Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved optical lens composition from which lenses can be fabricated using standard production methods as well as by injection molding and casting which require no spec a1 surface treatment to achieve efficacious use. A further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved composition for the fabrication of optical lens having unexpectedly superior toughness, dimensional stability, clarity, durability, hardness, wettability and high values of oxygen permeability. Still a further object of the present Invention is to provide a new and improved extended wear lens composition which is capable ot producing either hard or soft optical lenses which have and retain optimum physical properties while being readily formed into a variety of optical shapes. These and still further objects as shall hereinafter appear are readily fulfilled by the present invention in a remarkably unexpected manner as will be readily discerned from the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment thereof. Briefly stated, the composition of the present invention comprise. a copolymer derived from comonomers which include a methycryloxyalkylsilanol a di methacryloxyalkyl polysiloxane a tris trialkylsiloxy methacryloxyalkylsilane and an alkyl methacrylate. The corresponding acrylic acid esters may be used for any of the foregoing components. In the preferred composition, acrylic or methacrylic acid will be used as a wetting agent and, a polyfunctional ester, derived from the reaction of acrylic or methacrylic acid with an aliphatle di or polyol e.g. ethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, glycerol and the like , will be used as a crosslinker. The invention also provides, as new articles of manufacture, lenses fabricated from these copolymers having extraordinary extended wear which can be produced by injection molding, compression molding or casting either into the desired lens shape or into a lens button or blank from which a lens may be sniped The invention will be best understood by reference to the prior art previously identified, namely, Ratkowski et al, U.S. No. 4,419,505, and Keogh, U. S. No. 4,259,467, including the several references cited therein . While the copolymers of the present invention bear some similarities to those described by Gaylord, U.S. 3,808,178 Ellis et al, U.S. 4,168,122 and 4,152,508 andNovicky, U.S. patents 4,216,303 and 4,242,483, Neete U.S.4,306,042 and Foley E.P. 75004 in that they pre copolymers of alkyl acrylic esters with acrylic so lane esters , they differ significantly, as will hereafter appear, in that the comonomers of the present invention include an acryloxyalkylsilanol or a methacryloxyalkylsilanol, a siloxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, a di acryloryalkyl polysiloxane or a di methacryloxyalkyl polysiloxane, and a C1 C20 alkyl or cycloalkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid as essential components. Por purposes of this specification It is to be understood that the term acryloxy includes methacryloxy and the term acrylic includes methacrylic. The presence of an acryloxymethylsilanol and a dimethaerylpolysiloxane in the comonomer mixture in combination with an siloxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, an alkyl or cycloalkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid, methacrylic acid or other wetting agent and a polyol polyacrylate in, carefully selected ratios In the presence of an appropriate catalystlinitiator leads to copolymers which have distinctly improved extended wear properties and which enable one to manufacture contact lenses, or buttons therefor, and other optical lenses by those industry standard techniques known in connection with the manufacture of PMMA lenses.Further, the mechanical stability ot the copolymer also provides lenses having improved stability of lens curvature which affects focus distance and sharpness. No surface treatment is required toImprove lens wettability and no special cleaning solutions are required to maintain surface properties. In general, the contact lens copolymer compositions by weight percent of the present invention are formed by copolymerizing comonomers which Include 1 to 40 of an acryloxyalkylsilanol 1 to 75 of a diacrylpolysiloxane 1 to 75 of a siloxyalkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid and from 1 to 35 of a C1 C20 alkyl or cycloalkyl ester. of acrylic or methacrylic acid.

Representative acryloxyalkylsilanols of this type include bis trimethysiloxy gamma methacryloxypropylsilanol methyl trimethylsiloxy methacryloxymethylsilanol methyl trimethylsiloxy ss methacryloxyethylsilanol methyl trimethylsiloxy gamma metacryloxypropylsilanol bis trimethylsiloxy ss methacryloxyethylsilanol bis trimethylsiloxy methacryloxymethylsilanol trimethylsiloxy pentamethyldisiloxanyl methacryloxymethylsilanol trimethylsiloxy pentamethyldisiloxanyl ss methacryloxyethylsilanol trimethylsiloxy pentamethyldisiloxanyl gamma methacryloxypropylsilanol The polysiloxane diacrylates used in this invention have the general structureEMI7.2 Where in R CH3 or H m 0 3 n 1 5 X C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or Z Y C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or Z Z EMI8.1 R1 C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl R2 C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl and R3 t C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl. 1 a Representative polysiloxane dlacrylates are 1,3 bis methacryloxypropyl 1,3,3,terakis trimethysiloxy disiloxane 1,3 bis acryloxymethyl 1,1,3,3,tetrakis trimethylsiloxy disiloxane 1,3 bis methacryloxypropyl 1,1,3,3,tetrakis triethylsiloxy disiloxane and 1,5 bis methacryloxymethyl 1,1,3,3,5,5,hexa trimethylsiloxy trisiloxane. The siloxyalkyl acrylates have the general structure EMI8.2 Wherein R CH3 or H X C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or Z Y t C1 C6 alkyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl or Z EMI9.1 R1 X C1 Cs alkyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl m 0 3 R2 C1 Cs alkyl cyclohexyl, or phenyl n 1 5 R3 C1 C8 alkyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl and R4 3 C1 C6 alkyl. Representative siloxyalkyl acrylates are gamma methacryloxypropyl tris trimethylsiloxy silane gamma acryloxypropyl tris trimethylsiloxy silane and 5 methacryloxypropyl 1,1,1 trimethyl 3,3,5,5,tetrakis trimethyl siloxy trisiloxane. The C1 C20 alkyl and cycloalkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid which are useful as comonomers in forming the copolymer of the present invention includes methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate and ethyl methacrylate propyl acrylate and propyl methacrylate isopropyl acrylate and isopropyl methacrylate butyl acrylate and butyl methacrylate alkyl acrylate and amyl methacrylate hexyl acrylate and hexyl methacrylate heptyl acrylate and heptyl methacrylate octyl acrylate and octyl methacrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate nonyl acrylate and nonyl methacrylate decyl acrylate and decyl methacrylate undecyl acrylate and undecyl methacrylate lauryl acrylate and lauryl methacrylate cetyl acrylate and cetyl methacrylate octadecyl acrylate and octadecyl methacrylate and cyclohexyl methacrylate and cyclohexyl acry late. Other vinyl monomers which readily copolymerize with methylmethacrylate may be used in place of part or all of the preferred acrylates or methacrylates listed In the preceeding paragraph. Suitable replacement vinyl monomers include styrene, alpha methylstyrene, alkylated styrenes, diethyl itaconate, pertluorylethyl vinyl ether, isoprene, isobutylene, 4 methyl 1 pentene and chlorotrifluoro ethylene. Preterrably these monomers have a molecular weight of less than 300. The copolymers of the invention are prepared by mixing comonomers with a catalyst initiator. My preferred initiator is a free radical generating polymerization initiator of the type commonly used in polymerizing ethenyl functioning unsatured compounds. Representative free radical polymerization initiators includes acetyl peroxide lauroyl peroxide decanoyl peroxide capryl peroxide benzoyl peroxide tertiary butyl peroxypivalate ditsopropyl peroxycarbonate tertiary butyl peroetoate 2, 2 , azobis isobutyronitrile 2, 2 , azobis 2,4dimethyl valeronitrile methyl ethyl ketone peroxide di 2 phenoxyethyl peroxydicarbonate and di 2 phenoxyethyl methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. Conventional polymerization techniques are employed to produce the novel copolymers. The comonomer mixture containing between about 0.05 2 by weight of the free radical initiator is heated to a temperature between 30 C 100 C, preferably below 70 C, to initiate and eomplete the polymerization. The polymerization mixture can be heated in a suitable mold or container to form discs, rods or sheets which can then be machined to the desired shape using conventional equipment and procedures employed for fabricating lenses trow polymethyl methacrylate. The temperature is preferably maintained below 70XC in order to minimize the formation of bubbles in the copolymer. Instead of employing the bulk polymerization techniques described above, one can employ solution, emulsion or suspension polymerization to prepare the novel copolymers, using techniques conventionally used in the preparation of polymers from vinyl functioning unsaturated monomers CH CH2 , that is, ethenyl tunctioning monomers.The copolymer thus produced may be pressed or molded into rods, sheets or other convenient shapes which are then cut into buttons and thereafter machined to produce the contact lenses.Alternatively, the copolymer can be directly cast or molded into finished contact lenses or lens blanks with planar, convex or concave surfaces or any desired combination thereof. In a preferred practice owl the present invention, the monomer mixture is thermally polymerized in an appropriate mold or vessel to provide a block, sheet, rod, or plug, each of which may have r radius convex or radius concave or a plano surface, to provide a semitlnished or finished contact lens or other optical lens. The mold and vessel utilized will be formed of polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, Teflon, glass, or aluminum having its mold surface coated with Teflon As will hereinafter appear, certain applications are well served using glass test tubes or rods as the forming mold. It the wettability of the copolymers described above Is lower than desired, this property can be Improved by the addition to the copolymerizatlon mixture of from about 1 20 parts by weight ot a hydrophilic monomer. Such monomers include hydroxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates wherein the alkyl group contains about 2 to 5 carbon atoms, acrylic and methacrylic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, N methylolacrylamide, N methylolmethacrylamide, glycidyl acrylate and methacrylate, and N vinyl pyrrolldone The hydrophilic monomer content of the copolymerizatlon mixture is preferably about 3 to about 12 percent by weight. The resistance of lenses fabricated from the copolymer of the present Invention to lens flexure and warpage may be increased, if desired, by the Incorporation Into the copolymerization mixture of from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight of an acrylic ester of an alkyl polyol such as, for example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, butylene glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate and pentaerythritol triacrylate or tetraacrylate. The alkylpolyol polyacrylate content of the polymerization mixture Is preferrably from about 3 to about 12 percent by weight of the total composition. The principal function of the sllanol molety of the copolymer of the present invention is to improve the mechanical properties of conventional PMMA contact lens polymers. It appears that the Inclusion of the silanol as one of the comonomers in the polymerization mixture chiefly aftects the warpage characteristics of the copolymer which, In turn, as previously noted, determines the stabIlIty of lens curvature which controls focus distance and sharpness. In additon, the silanol moiety of the copolymer Imparts sIgnifIcantly improved oxygen permeability and wettability.Consequently, although the silanol component of the copolymerization mixture may be varied within the 1 40 percent by weight as set forth above, the preferred combination of mechanical and oxygen permeability properties and wettability is achieved by employing about 1 20 percent by weight of the silanol In the copolymerization mixture. Optimum results are obtained with a silanol concentration of 2 10 by weight In the polymerization mixture. In order to achieve the superior physical properties of the copolymers of the present invention, It is essential to Incorporate from about two to sixty percent by weight of the diacryloxypolysiloxane in the copolymerization mixture. Optimum results have been achieved when from about tour up to about sixty weight percent of a diacryloxy polysiloxane is included in the mixture. This type of comonomer makes possible the introduction of polysiloxane crosslinks as well as pendant groups having acryl and polysiloxane moieties. Such crosslinks and pendant groups enhance such important properties as oxygen permeability and dimensional stability, which provides greater visual acuity and enhanced durabilIty in the final lens.Accordingly, the incorporation of a diacryloxypolysiloxane in the monomer mixture contributes essential properties to the novel lens materials of this Invention The siloxyalkyl acrylates also contribute to the oxygen permeability of the copolymers of the present invention.Optimum overall properties of the copolymers are obtained when the concentration of the siloxyalkylacrylates in the polymerization mixture Is from about 5 to about 60 by weight. Within the foregoing limitations, the proportion ofC1 C20 alkyl or cycloalkyl esters of acrylic of methacrylic acias in the copolymerization mixture is preferably ten to thirty tive percent by weight. The particular tree radical polymerization initiator employed in accordance with the preferred practice of the Invention Is selected by reference to the requiredInitiation temperature. Thus, it conventional polymerization techniques are employed to produce cast rods or other shapes which are then machIned to produce the desired lenses, the preferred initiators are 2, 2 azobis isobutyronitrile .2, 2 azobis 2, 4 dimethylvaleronitrile , benzoyl peroxide, di 2 phenoxyethyl peroxydicarbonate, t butyl peroxyprivalate, and the like On the other hand, it it is desired to produce contact lenses or contact lens blanks by inject ion molding or direct casting, then a polymerizaton initiator having a higher intiation temperature would be employed in order to prevent premature polymerizaton in the injection molding or casting cavities. Such an initiator can be a mixture ot methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and cobalt naphthenate. In one practice of the present Invention, a copolymerization mixture is prepared by mixing the following comonomers, In the relative weight ratios Indicated, in s plastic container equipped with a conventional stirring and blending device. A mixture containing a hydroxysilane acrylate selected from the group consIsting of bis trimethylsiloxy gamma methacryloxypropylsilanol methyl trimethylsiloxy methacryloxymethylsilanol methyl trimethylsiloxy ss methacryloxyethylsilanol methyl trimethylsiloxy gamma methacryloxypropylsilanol bis trimethylsiloxy ss methacryloxyethylsilanol bis trimethylsiloxy methacryloxymethylsilanol trimethylsiloxy pentamethyidisi loxanyl methacryloxy methylsilanol trimethylsiloxy pentamethyldisiloxyanyl methacryloxymethylsilanol, and trimethylsiloxy pentamethyldisiloxyanyl gamma methacryloxymethylsilanol a polysiloxane diacrylate selected from the group consisting ofi 1,3 bis methacryloxypropyl 1,1,3,3,tetrakis trimethylsiloxy disiloxane 1,3 bis acryloxymethyl 1,1,3,3,tetrakis trimethylsiloxy disiloxane 1,3 bis methacryloxypropyl 1,1,3,3,tetrakis triethylsiloxy disiloxane and 1,5 bis methacryloxymethyl 1,1,3,3,5,5,hexa trimethylsiloxy trisiloxane an siloxyalkyl acrylate selected from the group consisting of 2Ç methneryloxypropyl tris trimethylsiloxy silane gamma acryloxypropyl tris trimethylsiloxy silane and 5 methacryloxypropyl 1,1,1 trimethyl 3,3,5,5,tetrakis trimethyl siloxy trisiloxane an alkyl or cycloalkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid in which said alkyl or cyeloalkyl has 1 20 carbon atoms r wetting agent a polyol polyacrylate crosslinker and a catalyst initiator. The copolymerization mixture will preferably contain from about 2 10 percent by weight of the silanol from 10 25 percent by weight of C1 C20 alkyl or cycloalkyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid from about 5 to about 60 percent by weight of an siloxyalkyl acrylate from 4 to about 60 percent by weight of a polysiloxane diacrylate from about 5 to about 11 percent by weight of a wetting agent from about S to about 10 percent by weight of a polyol acrylate crosslinker and about 0.1 to about 1.0 percent by weight of catalyst initiator. The mixture, when stirred for about 20 minutes, is readily pourable into a preselected mold which may be constructed of polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, Teflon , glass or aluminum having a molding surface coated with Teflon , The mold when filled with the copolymerization mixture is placed Into a water or silicone bath which in turn is placed into a vacuum oven. Alternatively, the resulting and readily pourable copolymerization mixture can be converted into z solid of the desired shape In a Teflon coated aluminum tube. In any care, the selected mold will have been thoroughly cleaned, as with a dry brurh and an anti static air gun, to remove all particulates therefrom. The filled molds are then placed in a water or silicone bath which In turn is placed into the oven. A very alight nitrogen flow is maintained through the oven. The oven, containing the filled molds In the nitrogen environment, is heated to 40 50 C to commence polymerization of the copolymer and this temperature ir maintained for r period of from 12 to 48 hours at which time the oven temperature is raised to 60 700C for aft additional 18 to 48 hours to complete polymerization. When heating at dO 70 C is completed, the oven is cooled to room temperature and the copolymer solids, e.g., rods or blanks are removed from their molds the polymerization tubes by gently tapping the bottom of each tube. The copolymer rods or blanks thus removed from their respective molds, are annealed by placing them upon suitable trays which are then placed In an oven. The oven is then evacuated to approximately 5 mn Hg and heated to a temperature of from 1000 to about 1500 C for a period ot from about 8 to about 36 hours. The duration of the annealing process Is Inversely related to the temperature selected. After heating for the desired time, the oven Is cooled to ambient temperature at which time atmospheric air Is slowly admitted into the oven until the, oven interior reaches atmospheric pressure. When the oven is thus cooled and the pressure balanced, the trays containing the annealed rods or blanks are removed from the oven and the annealed pieces are collected. When contact lenses or blanks are the ultimate objective, the rods wlll be machined to the desired diametrIc dimension, i.e., about 1 2 Inch 13 mn and then sliced into a plurality of buttons, each having a thickness of approximately 3 16 inch 4 mn . It should be noted that the copolymerization mixture of the present invent Ion can be tinted using any of the physiologically compatible color pigments or dyes currently used In PMWA contact lenses. Other dyes which are characterized as Pood, Drug, and Cosmetic dyes and Drug and Cosmetic dyes and are physiologically compatible with the optic environment can also be used. Thus lenses having blue, grey, green and brown tints as well as clear lenses can be produced by the present invent ton. To further aid in the understanding of the present invention but not as a limitation thereupon, reference is made to the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1 A copolymerization mixture is prepared by mixing tile following comonomers in the relative weight ratios indicated in a plastic mixing container and stirring for twenty nutes.Commonomers Parts bv weightBis trimethylsiloxy Illthucryloxypropylsilanol 7 1,3 Bis gamma methacryloxypropyl l,l,3,3,tetrakis trimethylsiloxy 7 dzslloxane gamma Methacryloxypropyl tris trimethylsiloxy silane 48Methyl Methycrylate 20Methacrylic Acid 10Ethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate 8 Initiator 2, 2 azobis isobutyronitrile 0.2 The resulting copolymerization mixture is readily poured into a plurality of thoroughly cleaned tubes, each of which presents a cylindrical mold cavity of approximately 15 mm in diameter and 42 mm in length. The filled tubes are then placed into a water or silicone bath which is, in turn, placed in an oven. A very slight positive nitrogen flow is maintained through the oven. The oven containing the molds in the nitrogen s.iivironment is then heated to 40 50 C for 24 48 hours and thereafter the temperature is increased to 60 700C for an additional 18 36 hours to complete polymerization. The oven I thereafter cooled to room temperature and the copolymer rods are removed from the molds. The copolymer rods are annealed by placing them flat In trays which are placed Into the vacuum oven. The oven is then evacuated to approximately 5 mm Hg and the oven is heated to 100 1500C for 8 36 hours according to Table A below.

The trays containing the annealed rods are then removed from the oven and the rods are collected. Each rod is then machined to the desired diametric dimension, about 13 mm, and thereafter sliced into a plurality of buttons lens blanks , each being approximately 4 mn thick. EXAMPLE 2 Standard Method for Determining Wetting Angle Ten contact lens buttons approximately 13 mm in diameter and 4 mm thick are prepared by slicing one of the copolymer rods produced according to Example 1, facing one flat surface of each button with a diamond turning tool and polishing the faced surface to the degree normally acceptable by contact lens standards. After immersing the buttons in a contact lens soaking solution such as benzalkonium chloride available as SOCLENS from Alcon or the like for 24 hours, each button is thoroughly washed with distilled water, blotted dry, and then thoroughly dried under vacuum in a 40 C oven for one week.After this preparation, the buttons are subjected to wetting angle determinations as described in the Standard Method for Determining Wetting Angle issued by the Contact Lens Manufacturers Association, Chicago, Illinois, dated April 10, 1978. Note that the smaller the wetting angle in degrees , the better the tear pump exchange. The results obtained for the ten buttons of this example gave an average wetting angle of 26.0 with a standard deviation of 1.50.
