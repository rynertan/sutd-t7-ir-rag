## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION STABILIZED HYDROXYPROPYL CELLULOSEOPHTHALMIC INSERTS AND PROCESS TO STERILIZE THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to stabilized hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts. It further relates to methods of sterilizing ophthalmic inserts comprising hydroxypropyl cellulose as well as two methoas of packaging such inserts. Hydroxypropyl cellulose was previously proposed as a ophthalmic insert material for the eye. For example, U.S.S.N. 166,423, filed July 7, 1980, teaches the use of such inserts for carrying a medicament which has a therapeutic or prophylactic effect in the eye. More recently hydroxypropyl cellulose was found to have itself a therapeutic usefulness in treating the disease of the eye known as dry eye syndrome U.S. 4,343,787. Since ophthalmic inserts as well as any material being used to treat the eye must be sterile, it follows that some means to sterilize ophthalmic inserts must be employed. Since the use of a bacteriostatic or a bactericidal agent in ophthalmic products is becoming more and more regarded with disfavor, other methods of preparing the inserts such as manufacture from sterile materials under sterile conditions were considered. Preparation by use of sterile materials under sterile conditions is not only time consuming, but is expensive and difficult to control. Clearly, exposure to gamma radiation is the superior means of sterilizing ophthalmic inserts. Unfortunately, exposure to gamma radiation was found to cause some not unsubstantial degree of cross linKing of the nydroxypropyl cellulose. This cross linking occurred on a random basis, and random cross liiiking may De radiation dose aependent. That is to say, those inserts exposed to maximal radiation were highly cross linked, and those inserts only minimally exposed to a sterilizing dose of raoiation were similarly minimally cross linked. Thus a production run of ophthalmic inserts, depending upon the location of the package relative to the radiation source, would have ophthalmic inserts that have a variable dissolution rate in the eye. This variable dissolution rate would naturally lead to a highly undesirable variable introduced into the therapeutic product. The amount of dosage released in a given time would thus vary from insert to insert. This is highly undesirable since it is extremely important that each patient receive a reproducable delivery rate of medicament from insertion to insertion. Hydroxypropyl cellulose is a non ionic water soluble cellulose ether having properties which are uniquely suitable for use in te preparation of ophthalmic inserts. Thus, it is water soluble and hence dissolves in the aqueous lacrimal fluids. In addition, it is tnermoplastic and can therefore be advantageously combined with the ophthalmic drug using conventional plastic processing procedures such as compression molding, injection molding and extrusion prior to unit dose subdivision.Hydroxypropyl cellulose is available in several polymeric forms, all of which are suitable in the preparation of the ophthalmic inserts of the present invention. Thus, the products sold by HerculesIncorporated of Wilmington, Delaware under the nameKLUCEL such as KLUCEL HF, HWF, MF, GF, JF, LF, and EF which are intended for food or pharmaceutical use are particularly useful in preparing the new inserts of our invention. The compositions of this invention can be prepared by various methods. Thus, the drug and the hydroxypropyl cellulose can be dissolved in a suitable solvent and the solution evaporated to afford a thin film comprising the hydroxypropyl cellulose and the drug which can then be subdivided to prepare suitable inserts containing the desired amount of the medicament. Alternatively, and in accordance with a preferred embodiment of our invention, we find that the inserts can be prepared most conveniently using the thermoplastic properties of the nydroxypropyl cellulose. For example, the medicament and the hydroxpropyl cellulose can be warmed together at temperatures between about 650C and 2050C and the resulting mixture molded to form a thin film. It is generally preferred to prepare the inserts by molding or extrusion in accordance with procedures which are well known in the art. The molded or extruded product can then De subdivided to arford inserts of suitable size for administration in the eye. For example, castings or compression molded films having a thickness of about 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm can be subdivided to obtain suitable inserts in the form of squares, rectangles, circles, semi circles, and the like containing the desired amount of active ingredient. Rectangular segments of the cast or compressed film having a thickness between about 0.5 and 1.5 mm can be cut to afford shapes such as rectangular plates of 4 x 5 15 mm or ovals of comparable size. Similarly, extruded rods having a diameter between about 0.5 and 1.5 mm can be cut into suitable sections to provide the desired dosage of medicament. For example, rods of 1.0 to 1 5 mm in diameter and about 10 mm long are found to be satisfactory. The inserts may also be directly formed by injection molding. All of the ophthalmic inserts prepared in accordance with the present invention should be formed so that they do not have any sharp edges or corners which could cause damage to the eye. The ocular inserts prepared in accordance with this invention can also contain plasticizers to make the ophthalmic inserts more pliable.Plasticizers suitable for this purpose must, of course, also be completely soluble in the lacrimal fluids of the eye. Examples of suitable plasticizers that might be mentioned are water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, trimethylol propane, di and tripropylene glycol, hydroxypropyl sucrose and the like. Typically, such plasticizers can be present in the ophthalmic insert in an amount ranging from about 0t to about 30 by weight. A particularly preferred plasticizer is water which is present in amounts of at least about 6 and more preferably at least about 10 . In actual practice, a water content of from about 6 to about 12 is preferred since it may be easily accomplished and adds the desired softness and pliability to the insert. When plasticizing the solid medicinal product with water, the medicinal product is contacted with air having a relative humidity of at least about 40 until said product picks up at least about 6 water and becomes softer and more pliable.In a preferred embodiment, the relative humidity of the air is from about 60 to about 99 and the contacting is continued until the water is present in the product in amounts of from about 68 to about 12 . Suitable drugs which can be administered by the inserts of the present invention that might be mentioned are antibacterial substances such as ss lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, neomycin, gramicidin, bacitracin, sulfonamides aminoglycoside antibiotics such as gentamycin, kanamycin, amikacin, sisomicin and tobramycin nitrofurazones, and the like antihistaminics and decongestants such as pyrilamine, chlorpheniramine, tetrahydrazoline, antazoline, and the like antiinflammatories such as cortisone, hydrocortisone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, fluocortolone, prednisolone, triamcinofone, indomethacin, Clinoril, its salts and its corresponding sulfide, and the like miotics and anticholinesterases such as echothiophate, pilocarpine, physostigmine salicylate, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and the like mydriatics such as atropine, homatropine, scopolamine, hydroxyamphetamine, and the like and other medicaments used in the treatment of eye 3 morpholino 4 3 t butylamino 2 hydroxypropoxy 1, 2,5 thiadiazole, i.e., Timolol especially as the hydrogen maleate salt. These drugs or derivatives thereof such as salts, covalent derivatives, for example, esters or amides, or other therapeutically active forms can be admixed with the hydroxypropyl cellulose in the form of the water soluble inserts prepared as described above for the treatment of various eye diseases.These forms are especially advantageous for the treatment of conditions where prolonged drug administration is indicated, for example, in eye diseases or eye disorders such as uveitis glaucoma, diseases of the cornea such as, for example, purulent keratitis, herpes simplex keratitis, herpes zoster, acne rosacea, interstitial keratitis, and the like, diseases of the orbit such as exophthalmos and periostitis and diseases of the conjunctiva such as mucopurulent conjunctivitis and ophthalmia. Also, this method of the administration of ophthalmic active drugs can be used when post operative treatment is needed after retinal or cataract surgery. The method of administering drugs as a water soluble insert is especially useful in the administration of pilocarpine to treat glaucoma, a condition characterized by an increase in intraocular pressure. One treatment of this condition involves the use of solutions of pilocarpine acid salts which are administered to the eye in the form of drops at frequent intervals. By inserting the ophthalmic inserts of the present invention, a miotic response of up to 9 10 hours may be obtained in rabbits compared to the short response of 2 4 hours obtained by the administration of drops. The pilocarpine can be administered preferably in the form of acid salts of this drug such as the hydrochloride, alginate, pamoate, and the like. The ophthalmic inserts of the present invention can contain up to about 358 by weight of pilocarpine to afford a dose of about 1 6 mgs of pilocarpine per insert. In general, the ophthalmic inserts of the present invention will contain from about 0.1 to about 35 of the medicament, from about 65 to about 99.9 of hydroxypropyl cellulose and from 0 to about 30 of plasticizer, preferably 6 12 water. In special situations, however, the amounts may be varied to increase or decrease the dosage schedule. If desired, the insert may also contain in addition to the plasticizers, buffering agents and preservatives. Suitable water soluble preservatives which may be employed in the insert are sodium bisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, ascorbate, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric borate, parabens, benzyl alcohol and phenylethanol. These agents may be present in amounts of from 0.001 to 5 by weight of solid insert1 and preferably 0.1 to 2 . Suitable water soluble buffering agents are alkali, alkali earth carbonates, phosphates, bicarbonates, citrates, borates, and the like, Buch as sodium phosphate, citrate, borate, acetate, bicarbonate and carbonate.These agents may be present in amounts sufficient to obtain a pH of the system of between 5.5 to 8.0 and especially 7 8 usually up to about 2 by weight of polymer. The inserts as is well known, can be prepared to dissolve in any given length of time, and accordingly the drug as well, by merely adjusting the size and weight of the insert, the molecular weight of the polymer and or by the use of other agents such as plactizers. Typically for an insert which contains approximately 108 by weight of water abd about 15 35t by weight of drug such as indomethacin and pilocarpine pamoate, and is from about 8 12 mg in weight. The dissolution rate is from about 0.5 mg hour to about 3 mg hour. Suitably, however, the dissolution rate may be from about 0.004 mg hour up to about 20 mg hour but preferably is from about 0.04 mg hour to about 4.0 mg hour and especially from about 0.08 mg hour to about 3.0 mg hour. The detailed examples describing specific methods of preparing the ophthalmic inserts incorporating hydroxypropyl cellulose included inSerial No. 166,423 filed July 7, 1980, which examples thereof are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, it was highly desirable that some means be found to protect the inserts from cross linking.We have now found that ophthalmic inserts comprising hydroxypropyl cellulose can be sterilized by exposure to gamma radiation if they are made to contain or, in the alternative, are surrounded by a specified moisture content. Thus, if ophthalmic inserts are allowed to reach equilibrium with a relative humidity of between 60 and 80 at room temperature 20 C so that the inserts have an equilibrium moisture content of not less than 6 nor more than 12 a reproducible insert will be obtained when exposed to gamma radiation to achieve sterilization. The prior literature suggests that exposure to gamma radiation sufficient to achieve sterilization of hydroxypropyl cellulose will also result in such a degree of cross linking and chain scission that the material is no longer suitable as a biodegradable ophthalmic insert. U.S. Patent 3,779,706 employs radiation through high energy electron beam sterilization end such is to be contrasted with gamma irradiation. Example 1 Hydroxypropyl Cellulose inserts 5 mg.
