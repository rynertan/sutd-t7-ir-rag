# Trigger operated tool handle switch.

## Abstract
An electrical switch having spaced stationary contacts and a contact carrier carrying a bridging contact in linear reciprocation relative to the stationary contacts, with the bridging contact biased toward the stationary contacts. The bridging contact has spaced opposite contacting ends forming a leading contact end and a trailing contact end for sliding movement between a bridging position where the contacting ends contact their respective stationary contacts, and a non bridging position where the leading contact end is out of engagement with its stationary contact. The bridging contact is rotatably hinged to the contact carrier and a projection is disposed between the stationary contacts for engagement with the leading contact end for pivoting and lifting the leading contact end from its stationary contact in coaction with the hinged connection with a quick break action during movement of the contact carrier to the non bridging position. Each conductor wire connected to the switch is releasably secured therein by a spring like retainer blade biased diagonally against the wire. Each retainer blade has a release arm for deactivating the retainer blade thus permitting easy withdrawal of the conductor wire. The release arm has a laterally extending handle lug on its exteriorly exposed free end to provide a handle and also to provide for engagement with the switch housing to limit inward movement of the release arm. The inner end of the release arm is beveled to provide a plane to plane contact with the retainer blade for a positive contact therewith.

## Description
TRIGGER OPERATED TOOL HANDLE SWITCH BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention has to do with improvements in trigger operated electric switches of the type wherein a bridging contact is slid between bridging and non bridging positions with respect to a pair of fixed contacts mounted in spaced relation on a dielectric base.The bridging contact includes a pair of spaced contact faces arranged for simultaneous engagement with respective fixed contacts thereby to define the bridging position of the bridging contact. One of these contact faces may slide along the associated fixed contact and remain in engagement with the same at all times. When the other of these contact faces engages the other fixed contact, the switch is closed for closing the associated circuit and energizing a load device, such as an electric motor. It is desirable that this other contact face be maintained in substantial spaced relation from the other fixed contact to define the open or off position of the switch.When it is desired to close the switch and circuit, it is desirable that such other contact face be brought into engagement with the other fixed contact in a quick and positive manner. This same quick and positive action is also desirable upon opening of the switch, such quick break action being essential to forestall premature pitting and corrosion of the contact surfaces. In our prior European application No. 79302598.2 dated 16th November 1979, which was published only after the priority date of the present application, there is described and claimed an electric switch mechanism for portable electric motor drive type tools comprising an insulator switch housing, at least a pair of stationary electrical contacts disposed in said switch housing in spaced relation to each other and with their contact making faces substantially coplanar, a reciprocable contact carrier disposed in the housing for linear reciprocation therein relative to said stationary contacts, a movable electrically conductive bridging contact carried by said contact carrier and having opposite contacting ends forming respectively a leading contact end and a trailing contact end spaced at approximately the same spacing as said stationary contacts for sliding movement between a non bridging position where said bridging contact is out of engagement with at least one of said stationary contacts and a bridging position where the bridging contact is in engagement with at least two of said stationary contacts in electrically conducting relation therewith, hinge means rotatably securing said bridging contact at a point adjacent its trailing contact end to said contact carrier, bias means in the contact carrier urging the movable bridging contact towards the stationary contacts, and a projection disposed between said stationary contacts for engagement with said leading contact end and configured for pivoting and lifting the leading contact end off of the adjacent respective stationary contact with a quick break action during movement of the bridging contact leading contact end to a level substantially above the contact making face of the adjacent respective stationary contact.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With the aim of providing an improved switch mechanism the invention comprises the structure defined in our prior application as above set forth, wherein said pivot type hinge means includes said bridging contact having an upwardly extending stem disposed at the top of the bridging contact at its trailing contact end, and said contact carrier has a pair of coacting spaced protuberances extending transversely therefrom and straddling the bridging contact stem to hingedly secure the bridging contact to the contact carrier. The invention will be further described in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In these drawings Figures 1 to 12 are the same as those of our earlier application referred to.

For convenience, the switch of our earlier application will first be described. The switch of the present invention will then be described, as a modification. Referring first to Figures 1 3, there is shown an electric switch mechanism for portable electric hand tools, generally designated as S, which includes as basic components the wrap aroun d switch housing H Figure 3 which encases the switch module or casing M that is operated by the bridging contact carrier C having a trigger handle 10. Casing M may be readily formed from electrical insulating material such as plastic or the like, and has nibs 20 on the sides thereof which are adapted to be received in snap fastening relation in openings 20a in the confronting sides of the housing member H for detachably holding the casing M and associated components in assembled relation with the wrap around housing H. The contact carrier C is reciprocably retained in the housing H by the interlocking action of the contact carrier tab 22 FIGURE 5 , engaging the switch housing rib 24 in coaction with the compressed coil contact carrier spring 26, which biases the contact carrier to a leftward off position as shown. A suitable spring push button plunger 30 is provided to coact with the trigger 10 and lock the contact carrier C in its full on position as is well known in the art. The plunger 30 is adapted to be pushed inwardly against the bias of its compressed coiled spring 31 to a releasably locked position as shown in FIGURE 8, such that the plunger pin 32 is disposed in the contact carrier notch 33 when it is desired to hold the contact carrierC in its full on or switch closing position. In operation, the trigger 10 is pressed inwardly such that the contact carrier C is moved to the position shown in FIGURE 7, then the plunger 30 is pressed inwardly and the trigger 10 is released, whereupon the contact carrier spring 26, which normally urges the contact carrier C to switch open position, presses the contact carrier C against the springpressed plunger 30 and holds it in depressed position.The next pressure upon the trigger 10 releases the springpressed plunger 30 so that it jumps outwardly and releases the contact carrier C to its off position as shown in FIGURE 5. The spring pressed plunger mechanism 30 will not be described in more detail as the same forms no part of the present invention and is fully described in assignee s UIS. patent No. 3,536,973, issued October 27, 1970. The present invention is directed to improvements in electric switches of the type shown in the switch mechanism portion of assignee s U.S. patent No. 3,603,757, issued September 7, 1971, reissue patent RE.26,267 issuedSeptember 26, 1967 and its parent patent 3,222,488 issued on December 7, 1965, such present invention now being described in an embodiment of a switch which makes and breaks the contacts in both sides of an energizing electrical source, although those skilled in this art will understand that one side only of the like might incorporate the switch while the other line was unbroken. Referring now to FIGURES 5 7, the insulator switch housing H contains the switch module portion M which has at least a pair of spaced stationary electrical contacts 40 and 41 having their contact making faces coplanar. The contact carrier C is disposed in the housing H for linear reciprocation relative to the stationary contacts as described in the aforementioned U. S. patentNo. 3,603,757. The contact carrier is normally disposed in a leftward off position, as shown in FIGURE 5, by the biasing action of the compressed contact carrier coil spring 26 which is disposed between the contact carrier and the opposite wall of the housing H. The contact carrier C carries with it in its reciprocable movement an electrically conductive bridging contact 44 which has opposite coacting ends forming, respectively, a leading contact end 46, and a trailing contact end 48, spaced approximately at the same spacing as the stationary contacts 40 and 41, for sliding movement between a non bridging position FIGURE 5 , where the bridging contact leading end 46 is out of engagement with the stationary contact 41 and a bridging position FIGURES 6 and 7 , where the bridging contact leading edge 46 is in engagement with the stationary contact 41 in electrically conducting relation therewith. The trailing end 48 is always in contact with the stationary contact 40. The bridging contact 44 is hinged to the contact carrier C by suitable hinge means preferably in the form of the bridging contact aperture 50 disposed at the trailing contact end of the bridging contact in coaction with the contact carrier protuberance 52 extending transversely from the contact carrier into and through the aperture 50 to hingedly secure the bridging contact 44 to the contact carrier C. It is to be noted that the aperture 50 is elongated permitting added linear and pivotal movement to the bridging contact 44 to position the leading contact end 46 at a level substantially above the contact making face of the adjacent respective stationary contact 41 in the off position. The bridging contact is biased towards the stationary contacts 40 and 41 by suitable bias means in the form of the compressed coil spring 54 disposed between the bridging contact 44 and the contact carrier C as shown. A projection 60 is disposed between the stationary contacts 40 and 41 for engagement with the contact carrier leading contact end 46, and is configured for pivoting and lifting the leading contact end off of the adjacent respective stationary contact 41 in coaction with the aforedescribed hinge means 50, 52 , with a quick break action during movement of the bridging contact leading contact end 46 to a level substantially above the contact making face of the adjacent respective stationary contact 41. In one form of the invention, the projection 60 is approximately one eighth of an inch in height above the plane of the contact making faces of the sta tionary contacts 40 and 41 to provide, in coaction with the aforedescribed quick break action, a quick and positive clean break of any electrical arc that may develop between the leading end 46 and the stationary contact 41 from the voltages 110 or 220 volts normally encountered in electric hand tool use. Referring now to the construction shown inFIGURES 9 and 10, each conductor wire such as, for example, the wire 70, leading in and connected to the switchS is secured therein by a spring like elongated diagonally disposed retainer blade 72 biased against the wire 70 to provide firm electrical contact between the wire and the stationary blade 41, and to provide firm retention of the wire in such position in the switch. The present modification is an improvement over the structure shown in assignee s U. S. patent No. 3,977,751, issued August 31, 1976. The module casing M has a wire passageway 74 disposed below and leading to a point near the free outer end of the retainer blade 72 and adjacent the stationary contact 41 for receiving the bared portion of the conductor wire 70. The module casing M also has a release arm passageway 76 adjacent the wire passageway 74 and a wire release arm 78 is disposed in the release arm passageway 76 for selectively deactivating the retainer blade 72 by upward movement of the release arm to permit ready withdrawal of the wire 70 from coaction with the respective stationary contact 41. The release arm 78 is thus slidable in the release arm passageway 76 so as to be engageable with the retainer blade 72 for moving the latter out of gripping coaction with the wire 70 to permit withdrawal of the wire from the module M.It will be noted that the aforedescribed passageways are formed in part by the switch housing H. A retaining means is provided to retain the release arm 78 in operating position with the module M.Specifically, the release arm 78 has locking means in the form of an arm abutment 80 FIGURE 4 . Likewise, the module casing has restraining means in the form of a shoulder 82 extending toward the release arm 78 to engage the arm abutment 80 and reciprocably retain the release arm in operative position in the release arm passageway 76. It is to be noted that the inner end 84 of the release arm 78, which contacts the retainer blade 72, is beveled to effect a plane to plane contact with the retainer blade to provide a more positive and firm contact therewith. The lower portion of the release arm 78 is disposed exteriorly of module casing M and the release arm has a laterally extending handle lug 90 on its exteriorly exposed free end for engagement with the exterior surface of the module casing M to limit inward movement of the release arm with respect tothe module casing and also forms a handle enabling facile manual operation of the release arm. It will be noted that each stationary contact 40, 41 has a retainer blade with a coacting release arm, such structure further including adjacent release arms being connected together to form a U shaped tandem release member R, as best shown in FIGURE 4. Referring now to the modification shown inFIGURE 11 OFF position and in FIGURE 12 ON position the structure and function of the switch T therein is similar in structure and function to the aforedescribed switch S except for the pivot type hinge means which hingedly secures the bridging contact 44 to the contact carrier C, now to be described. In FIGURES 11 and 12, the bridging contact 44 has an upwardly extending stem 91 formed in its top surface at its trailing contact end. The contact carrier C is provided with a second protuberance 92, which is spaced from the aforedescribed first protuberance 52.Thus, the contact carrier C has a pair of coacting spaced protuberances 52 and 92 which extend transversely from the contact carrier and straddle the bridging contact stem 91 to hingedly secure the bridging contact to the contact carrier. This structure effectively hingedly connects or links the contact carrier to the bridging contact, thus enabling sliding movement of the bridging contact between its non bridging or OFF position FIGURE 11 to a bridging or ON position FIGURE 12 , and back again by pivoting and lifting the leading contact end 46 off the stationary contact 41 with a quick break action as aforedescribed. It is to be noted that in the forward or to the right movement of the bridging contact to the ON position shown in FIGURE 12, the protuberance 52 contacts the stem 91. In the return or to the left movement of the bridging contact to the OFF position shown in FIGURE 11, the protuberance 92 contacts the stem 91. The terms and expressions which have been employed are used as terms of description, and not of limitation, and there is no intention, in the use of such terms and expressions, of excluding any equivalents of the features shown or described, or portions thereof, but it is recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention claimed.
