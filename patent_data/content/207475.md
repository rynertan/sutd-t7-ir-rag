## Description
the present invention relates to a process for preparing secreted lipids, optionally in combination with non secreted lipids, by employing fungi or algae capable of biosynthesizing lipids which comprises conducting the reaction in a reaction system wherein surfactants are present. Not only lipids themselves produced by microorganism cell can be used as starting materials for oils and fats but also useful substances such as varieties of sterols and higher fatty acids, which are obtained by purification of the lipids, can also be utilized for a wide application in the fields of food, drug and general industry. Therefore, hitherto energetical studies have been made to improve the productivity of lipids or to produce lipids in a desirable composition. In recent years, this technical field is increasingly drawing public attention since it has now been made clear that, among unsaturated fatty acids recovered from the above mentioned lipids, arachidonic acid or γ linolenic acid has various physiological activities. For preparing such lipids, a process for preparing cacao butter like oils and fats JP A 75292 1985 , a process for preparing arachidonic acid JP B 64482 1977, Biotechnology and Bioengineering , Vol. 25, 1057 1983 , and a process for preparing γ linolenic acid JP B 22280 1972 and 22199 1983 are already known. Furthermore, from US A 2697061, GB A 2091285 and Agr. Biol. Chem. 1976 , 40 4 , p. 719 723, the production and isolation of lipids synthesized by fungi in the presence of surfactants in the culture medium are known. However, these processes have disadvantages, i.e. the amount of lipids accumulated in various microorganism cells is limited and thus it is impossible to produce lipids in a sufficient amount. Further, since most of lipids are accumulated in the cells, complex extraction procedures such as crushing or acid treatment of the cells are required in order to recover the lipids. When such extraction procedure is carried out, a purification process becomes extremely complicated due to a large amount of impurities extracted, which has been an obstacle for an industrialization. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to find a novel process for preparing lipids wherein lipids can be prepared in high yield and can be easily recovered. As the result of continuous efforts, it has been found that the lipids accumulated in the cell can be secreted in a large amount and the lipids can be easily recovered in high yield, when immobilized microorganism particle of the fungi or algae capable of biosynthesizing lipids is employed in the reaction system wherein surfactants are present. In this manner, the lipids can more efficiently be prepared in high yield since the concentration of the microorganisms in the reaction vessel is maintained at high concentration. Although a process for preparing glutathione in yeast cells is already known JP A 86691 1979 as the process wherein useful substances prepared in the cell are secreted into the reaction solution, this process is distinguished from the process of the present invention in the kind of microorganisms and of substances accumulated. Thus, the process for preparing lipids wherein produced lipids are efficiently secreted into the reaction solution has never been known. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for preparing secreted lipids optionally in combination with non secreted lipids by employing fungi or algae capable of biosynthesizing lipids which comprises conducting the reaction in a reaction system wherein surfactants are present, which is characterized in that immobilized microorganism particle of fungi or algae is employed. According to the process of the present invention, secreted lipids can be accumulated in the reaction solution in a large amount. Although the mechanism that the lipids are smoothly secreted out of the cells is not clearly known, it is presumed that the surfactants act on the surface of the microorganism cells and improve the permeability of the cell membranes without adversely affecting the growth of the microorganisms if the surfactants is present in the reaction solution under proper reaction condition. From the thus obtained lipids in the reaction solution, i.e. oils and fats, various sterols, and various higher fatty acids can be easily recovered in high yield by the usual extraction and purification processes. Any fungi and algae can be employed in the present invention as far as the microorganism is capable of biosynthesizing lipids. Useful examples of the microorganisms are those belonging to the genus of 1 Typical preferred examples of the strain belonging to the above each genus are, for instance, The culture condition of such microorganisms is not particularly limited as far as the microorganisms can grow. For the fungi, the medium containing carbohydrates such as glucose, molasses and sucrose, ethanol, acetic acid or hydrocarbons such as n alkane, n decane, hexadecane and heptadecane as a carbon source, to which other necessary nutrient sources are added, is generally employed. Conditions such as temperature, pH and reaction time can be adjusted to those suitable for each microorganism. Also for the algae, the commonly known inorganic nutrient source is employed as the basic medium and the conditions such as illumination intensity, temperature, pH and reaction time can be properly adjusted for each microorganism. The surfactants present in the reaction system of the present invention may be any of cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants or amphoteric surfactants. Among them, anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants are particularly effective. As the anionic surfactants, compounds having properties of anionic surfactants, e.g. 1 carboxylate type high molecular surface active agent, 2 polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate, 3 polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ether sulfate, 4 dialkyl sulfosuccinate, 5 alkylbenzene sulfonate, 6 alkyl sulfate, 7 fatty acid salt, 8 alkyl phosphate, 9 alkyl naphthalene sulfonate, 10 aromatic sulfonic acid formaldehyde condensate, and 11 naphthalene sulfonic acid formaldehyde condensate, can be used. Among them, the compounds 1 to 9 are especially effective. As the typical example of commercially available product, the compound 1 includes Demol EP made by Kao Corporation , Poiz 540 made by Kao Corporation , Eleminol MBN 1 made by SANYO CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD. , Eleminol MBN 2 made by SANYO CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD. , Sanspal PS 8 made by SANYO CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES, LTD. , and Polystar OM made by Nippon Oil and Fats Co., Ltd. the compound 2 includes Emal 20 C made by Kao Corporation and the like the compound 3 includes Sannol NES made by LION CORPORATION , and Emal NC made by Kao Corporation and the compound 4 includes Pelex OT P made by Kao Corporation , and Rapisol B 30 made by Nippon Oil and Fats Co., Ltd. . As the nonionic surfactants, compounds having properties of nonionic surfactants, e.g. 1 polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, 2 polyoxyethylene polypropylene blockpolymer, 3 sorbitan fatty acid ester, 4 polyethylene glycol fatty acid ester, 5 polyoxyethylene alkylether, 6 polyoxyethylene alkylphenylether, 7 fatty acid monoglyceride, and 8 polyoxyethylene alkylamine can be used. Among them, the compounds 1 to 4 are especially effective. As the typical example of the commercially available product, the compound 1 includes, for example, Nissan nonion LT 221 made by Nippon Oil and Fats Co., Ltd. , Rheodol TW L120 made by Kao Corporation , and Tween 20 made by Nakarai Chemicals, Ltd. for polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate Rheodol TW P120 made by Kao Corporation , and Tween 40 made by Nakarai Chemicals, Ltd. for polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate and Rheodol TW S120 made by Kao Corporation for polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate Nissan nonion OT 211 made by Nippon Oil and Fats Co., Ltd. , Rheodol TW 0120 made by Kao Corporation , and Tween 80 made by Nakarai Chemicals, Ltd. for polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate and Rheodol TW 0320 made by Kao Corporation for polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate. The compound 2 includes Plonon 201, and Plonon 102 made by Nippon Oil and Fats Co., Ltd. the compound 3 includes Nissan nonion OP 85R made by Nippon Oil and Fats Co., Ltd. , Rheodol SP 030 made by Kao Corporation , and Emasol O 30 F made by Kao Corporation the compound 4 includes Emanon 4110 made by Kao Corporation . A mixture of the anionic surfactants and the nonionic surfactants in a proper ratio can also be employed. The surfactants may be added to the reaction system either at an early stage of the reaction, or during the reaction or at a late stage of the reaction to effectively secrete the lipids. If these surfactants induce severe foaming, a suitable amount of the commonly used antifoaming agent may be added. In order to allow the lipids to be accumulated in the reaction solution effectively, an amount of the surfactants present in the reaction system, ranges in case of the nonionic surfactants, from 0.005 to 5 by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 1 by weight since a concentration of not more than 0.05 by weight cannot provide effective action to the cell membrane and a concentration of not less than 5 by weight has an unfavorable effect on the growth of the microorganism. In case of the nonionic surfactants, an amount of the surfactants present in the reaction system ranges from 0.05 to 8 by weight, preferably from 0.3 to 3 by weight by the same reason. Although the microorganism may be cultured by the conventional culture such as batch culture, semibatch culture or continuous culture in the usual suspension system, the culture is more efficiently conducted if the microorganism is immobilized as the immobilized microorganism. For immobilization, either entrapping method using a gelling agent or physical adsorption method using a microorganism supporting material may be employed. As the gelling agent, commonly known substances such as polyacrylamide, alginic acid, carrageenan, collagen and urethane polymer. As the microorganism supporting material, any porous material can be employed which enables immobilization through sticky property of the fungi or the algae. For example, polymer foam material such as polyolefine polymer such as polyethylene or polypropylene, diene polymer such as butadiene or isoprene, polyurethane, vinyl polymer such as polyvinyl chloride, polyacrylamide or polystyrene, condensation polymer such as polyether, polyester, polycarbonate or nylon, silicone or fluorine contained resin inorganic material such as ceramic, glass, active carbon, pumice or metal can be employed. In order to effectively immobilize the microorganism on these microorganism supporting material, the material may preferably be a porous material having a porosity of 70 to 99 and a pore number of 2 to 50 per linear length of the material, or a processed metal material having a porosity of 70 to 99 . Generally, the microorganisms as mentioned above show a pellet like or mycelioid appearance as they grow. When the material having the above mentioned properties is employed, the microorganism is adsorbed and immobilized during the growth of the microorganism through sticky property of the microorganism itself or entrapping by the supporting material. Various supporting materials can suitably be applied depending on a kind of the microorganism, the reaction condition or the like. The material processed into a form such as, for instance, globe, block, ring, tube or sheet may be employed. Although a size of the material may be varied depending on a kind of the microorganism, the reaction condition, a kind of the reaction vessel or the like, generally the material in the globular form may have a diameter of 1 to 100 mm and the material in the form of block may have a side length of 1 to 100 mm. The immobilization of the microorganism to the above mentioned supporting material can easily be conducted by a known culture such as batch culture, semibatch culture or continuous culture. For example, the empty supporting material, which is previously sterilized by steam sterilization and the like, and the microorganism such as, for instance, In the present invention, the aeration is conducted by air, oxygen or mixed gas thereof. Although the reaction vessel employed in the present invention may be any bubbling type with stirrer or without stirrer, usually the vessel without stirrer is preferable in view point of the operatability and the cost when the immobilized microorganism is employed. The thus obtained lipids in the reaction solution can be recovered by the conventional purification procedure such as solvent extraction. Further, various higher fatty acids or sterols can also be obtained in high purity by known method for separation and purification such as chromatography. The lipids remained in the cells can also be recovered after treatment such as homogenization, and the various useful substances are obtained. According to the process of the present invention, the lipids can be obtained in much higher yield than the conventional process wherein surfactants is not present. Further, the process of the present invention can simplify the purification process and produce the lipids in high purity and in high yield, which is advantageously suitable for producing lipids in an industrial process. The present invention is more particularly explained by the following Examples. In the following Examples, the lipids prepared in the reaction solution was analyzed by a conventional gravimetric method after solvent extraction with chloroform. After solvent extraction, hydrolysis and methylesterification, various higher fatty acids were analyzed by a gas chromatography. The lipids remained in the cells were also analyzed in the same manner as in the case of the lipids prepared in the reaction solution after homogenization of the cells. Various fungi were cultured by a shaking culture on the A medium having the composition 4 of glucose, 0.3 of KH₂PO₄, 0.2 of NH₄ ₂SO₄, 0.1 of NH₂ ₂CO, 0.05 of MgSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.001 of FeSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.001 of CaCℓ₂ 2H₂O, 0.00002 of CuSO₄ 5H₂O, 0.0001 of ZnSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.0001 of MnCℓ₂ 4H₂O, 0.01 of NaCℓ, 0.04 of yeast extract, 0.04 of malt extract and 0.02 of polypeptone, or on the B medium having the composition 3 of glucose, 0.3 of KH₂PO₄, 0.3 of NH₄NO₃, 0.03 of MgSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.02 of yeast extract, 0.02 of malt extract, 0.001 of FeSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.00012 of CaCℓ₂ 2H₂O, 0.00002 of CuSO₄ 5H₂O and 0.0001 of ZnSO₄ 7H₂O, with the initial pH of 6.0 at 30 The results obtained from the reaction of Table 3 shows a ratio between the amount of the lipid, arachidonic acid or γ linolenic acid, in the reaction solution and a total amount of the produced lipids. In these Tables, figures in parenthesis show the results of the control. Arachidonic acid and γ linolenic acid obtained as above were separated and purified by the conventional technique such as chromatography to produce products in high purity of not less than 97 . In Table 3, the results show the ratio between an amount of arachidonic acid in the reaction solution and a total amount of arachidonic acid by employing the B medium with respect to the microorganism in column 1 the ratio between an amount of arachidonic acid in the reaction solution and a total amount of arachidonic acid by employing the D medium with respect to the microorganism in column 2 the ratio between an amount of γ linolenic acid in the reaction solution and a total amount of γ linolenic acid by employing the A medium with respect to the microorganism in column 3 the ratio between an amount of γ linolenic acid in the reaction solution and a total amount of γ linolenic acid by employing C medium with respect to the microorganism in column 4 the ratio between an amount of the lipid in the reaction solution and a total amount of the lipid by employing the C medium with respect to the microorganism in column 5, respectively. Various fungi were cultured by employing the A medium as in Example 1 under the same condition to produce lipid. Table 4 shows the ratio between an amount of the lipid in the reaction soution and a total amount of the lipid, figures in parenthesis showing the results of the control wherein the surfactants was not added. The composition of fatty acid in the thus obtained lipid was similar to that shown in Table 2 in Example 1, i.e. content of γ linolenic acid is 8 to 20 with respect to When the microorganism supporting material is employed, about 1 ℓ of the microorganism supporting material, polyurethane in the form of block or nylon in the form of block, each having side length of 6 mm, porosity of 95 to 98 and pore number of 30 pores cm, together with the above obtained seed cell were cultured with aeration by means of the conventional bubble tower in 2 ℓ of the same medium as in Example 1. The microorganisms were physically adsorbed on the supporting material after 100 hours of the culture. Successively, the reaction was continued in the presence of surfactants to produce lipid. When alginic acid was employed as a gelling agent, the seed cells prepared as above were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 2 solution of sodium alginate. The suspension was dropped through the nozzle to a solution of 0.1 M CaCℓ₂, which was previously stirred, to prepare sphere gel having about 4 mm of diameter. When carrageenan was employed as a gelling agent, similarly cells were suspended in a carrageenan solution and the suspension was dropped to a 2 solution of KCℓ to prepare sphere gel having about 4 mm of diameter. Bubble tower was charged with about 1 ℓ of the thus obtained sphere gel and the reaction was conducted in the presence of surfactants to produce lipid. The reaction was carried out employing the same medium as that employed for preparing the seed cells at 30 By measuring an amount of lipid in the reaction solution, the results shown in Table 6 was obtained.
