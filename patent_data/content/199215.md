# SUBCARATINACEOUS ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC PROBE

## Abstract
A self preparing subcaratinaceous probe for elec troencephalographic measurement includes a spring body which applies a penetrating force to a plow which parts hair and scrapes through a dead caratinaceous layer of skin to a bloodrich epidermis layer while the probe is being posi tioned on the head without causing bleeding. The plow includes tabs which form a gap for parting the hair and scraping the skin. The probe also includes an electrolyte tube which can be used to apply electrolyte solution to the skin and plow after it is positioned.
