## Description
Automatical snow chains This invention relates to automatical snow chains or anti skid divices of the type comprising a pulley or wheel which is made to abut on the side of the vehicle wheel. At the rotation of the pulley, as a consequence of this, short chain pieces attached to the pulley are thrown in between the driving wheel and the ground. The principle of this type of snow chains is simple per se, but in practice, it is regrettfully not easy to obtain a perfect function.Apart from the so to speak pure mounting problems, i. e. how to get the backward and forward motion against the side of the wheel and where the pulley provided with chains is to be parked when not in operation etc. it is found in mounting that the position of the chain pulley or wheel relative to the vehicle wheel is relatively sensitive and the position or positions within which a perfect function is obtained can be both relatively difficult to define as well as difficult to reproduce, especially against the background of the relatively great manufacturing tolerances that may exist even between vehicles in the same series and of the same type.The final adjustment of automatical snow chains has therefore so far been combined with a relatively diligent filing and knocking at mounting details to achieve fairly correct conditions, and moreover, it has been a necessity to have well trained people to ensure a correct function. Despite this one has not known if an optimal function has been obtained or not. The truth is that the circumstances deciding whether a protection against skidding of this kind functions or not are considerably more complicated than what experts in this field have thought so far. It is the object of the invention to make clear the prevailing and desired conditions and to indicate a method and a device to enable an optimal function. In order to ensure a good function it is important that always at least two chains are under the wheel. The contact surface of the wheel against the ground and the real radius of gyration of the chain wheel will decide in this way the required minimum number of chains. However, the number of chains must not be too great as the chains may then easily get entangled in one another. A suitable number of chains at truck wheels is 5 7 chains, conveniently 6. Moreover the method by which the chains are moved in under the wheel is very essential. If the chains are thrown in too high they will bounce against the wheel and if they are thrown in too low a rebound against the ground is obtained, and both these phenomena result in a disturbed function i.e. the chains do not get properly under the wheel . A suitable height is 7 cm at normal truck tyres. The level of the thrown in is one of the most important parameters of a good function. However, it must also be considered that the rotation of the chain pulley is actuated by the contact against the tyre side and by the motion of the chains under the wheel. The contact against the tyre side tends to increase the rotation and the contact under the wheel brakes the pulley. As, moreover, the chains are locked when they are under the wheel it is essential with a relatively symmetrical location of the chain pulley under the wheel axis, or, as an alternative, the pulley can be placed somewhat behind the wheel axis which can give a reduction of the stresses . A suitable location is exactly under the centre to 1 cm behind. It is the object of the invention to eliminate the above problems and to give a final adjusting possibility which, at the same time, must be rough, simple, cheap and not at least, anyone must be able to handle it after a very moderate instruction. The reason for this is that any workshop must be able to mount the automatical snow chain.In order to ensure a good function of the chain it is im portant that these are thrown in relatively exactly between wheel and ground both vertically and horizontally. In order to solve this task against the background of the above demands the central bolt of the chain pulley in accordance with the invention is attached to the means for moving the pulley from parking position to contact with the vehicle wheel via an attachment so made that a certain change of the position of the chain pulley can be achieved in the direction of the vehicle and an angular adjustment of the inclination of the chain pulley relative to the horizdntal plane in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle. Thus, in accordance with the inventive thought it is enough with these two instalment parameters to establish correct operational conditions at a final adjustment. Surprisingly enough it is thus sufficient with an adjustment of only two of the six positions and angle parameters of the chain pulley to achieve an optimal function.Therefore, in a suitable further development of the invention, the adjusting possibility of the chain pulley can be obtained by means of a T shaped bolt arranged at the end of the movable arm in an elongate hole with toothed adges, in which a corresponding toothing on the lateral projections of the T shaped bolt can engage, two cooperating washers with cylindrical surfaces are arranged at the other side of the elongate hole one convex and the other concave. In this way a longitudinal in the direction of the car and angular adjustment can be obtained which is capable of giving a satisfactorey adjustment of the above mentioned parameters. When tightening the nut on the T shaped bolt the position of the pulley is locked longitudinally and anglularly.In order to reinforce this locking the convex washer has been provided with ridges on the upper and lower side which penetrate into the surrounding structure. In order further to secure the position of the bolt this can be pinned onto the sleeve. In a practical case it may simply be indicated for a given type of vehicle how high above ground the front or rear edge of the chain pulley is to be adjusted as well as where in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle wheel it is be be in contact with this. In this connection it should be mentioned that a possibility of a lengtwise adjustment of 1 cm and a moderate angle adjusting possibility are enough and necessary . Another problem is that usual chains when they are gripped between ground and wheel are exposed to twisting forces which in their turn result in that the chain tries to become shorter with accompanying stability disturbance of the vehicle lateral throws and a reduction of the frictional forces as the chain may roll under the wheel. To solve this problem which means in practice that the chains move relative to the contact surface of the tyre and are more separated in this way it is certainly poosible to increase the number of chains so that the increased spreading is counteracted. However, this does not eliminate the lateral throws. Therefore chains are suggested according to the invention which are twisted. In this way lateral throws as well as chain rolling are eliminated without an increased number of chains being necessary. Another problem is the fact that a slippery road often result in a water film on the side of the vehicle wheel and consequently it may easily happen that the chain pulleys supporting the chains are not put into rotation by the vehicle wheel as intended, as the thin intermediate water film on the vehicle wheel results in aquaplaning of the chain pulleys. This problem is solved by giving the periphery of the pulley a cross section of such a small radius that it is capable of pressing away a possible water film on the side of the vehicle wheel in the contact surface between pulley and vehicle wheel. Further advantages are obtained by the device being made in accordance with the characteristic features defined in the subclaims. The invention will be described below more in detail in the form of an illustrative example in connection with the drawing, wherein Fig 1 shows the device of the invention as seen from above, Fig 2 shows a longitudinal section thereof and Fig 3 shows a perspective view from above of the chain wheel according to the invention, Fig 4 shows a perspective view of the same chain wheel as seen from below and Fig 5 shows schematically a chain wheel device according to the invention. On the outer portion of the arm holding the chain pulley an oval sleeve 1 is attached which is provided with toothed flanks 2 supporting a transversal beam 3, also toothed,of a bolt 4 which is motion centre of the wheel 5.Between the oval sleeve and the bearing of the chain wheel, two washers 6 and 7 are inserted, the mutual contact surface which are cylinderically shaped with the transversal beam 3 as centre of radius of the rounding. The washer 6 has a ridge 8 on its upper side and a ridge 9 on its underside. After the chain being adjusted to correct position angularly and longitudinally the nut 10 holding the chain pulley is tightened, whereby its ridges engage with surrounding details and lock the position of the bolt 4.In order to lock the position of the bolt further a hole 11 is drilled in the oval sleeve and the bolt,after adjustment and tightening, in which hole a pin locking the position is inserted. The arm holding the chain wheel 11 is preferably elastic, e.g. by being made from spring steel or a similar material. As is apparent from Figs 3 5 the chain supporting pulley comprises according to the invention an edge lining 2 arranged on the periphery of a wheel 21 cast of aluminum. The cross section of the edge lining 22 is made with such a small radius that a possible water film on the vehicle wheel can be pressed away by the edge lining upwards and downwards. On the underside of the aluminum wheel 21 a steel ring shaped disc 27 is attached by means of rivets 30. On the underside of this steel ring chain pieces 24 are then welded. These are twisted and made of an angular profile and eliminate the possibility of lateral movement of the chain as a twisted chain is substantially dumb to further twisting, especially in the direction towards which it is twisted. By making the pulley in the above way with an aluminum casting to which is riveted a steel dis carrying the chain pieces, the pulley will be light and further more it will not be distorted when the chains are welded to the disc. As a consequence of the above the chains on the different sides of the vehicle are twisted in differentdirections, i.e. on one side twisted to the right and on the other side to the left. As it may be difficult to see, when the chain pulley is in the correct position, i.e. the position giving a thrown level of the chains of 7 cm above ground 7 cm 1 cm a simple cardboard or plastic rule or tenplate can be delivered with every set, which imitates the chain position when the pulley is in motion. The rule is preferably provided with simple means gripping the pulley or is held against this faciliating angle adjustment.
