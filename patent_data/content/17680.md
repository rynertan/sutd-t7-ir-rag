The compounds of the invention are shown and described as 4 pyrimidones and these exist in equilibrium with the corresponding 6 pyrimidones, and to a lesser extent in the following tautomeric forms EMI2.1 The 2 ,4 and 6 hydroxypyridyl groups can exist as lH pyrimidone tautomers, and certain of the Het groups can exist in several tautomeric forms. All these tautomeric forms of the compounds of Structure 1 are within the scope of the present invention. rn a process of the invention a compound of Structure 1 is prepared by reacting a compound of Structure 3 EMI3.1 in which Q is nitroamino NO2NH , lower alkylthio, benzylthio, chlorine, bromine or other group which can be displaced with a primary amine, Z and A are as defined for Structure lX and Het2 is a pyridyl group substituted by hydroxy, a protected hydroxy group or N oxo and optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, with an amine of Structure 2 in which Het and Y are as defined for .S.tructure 1 and removal of any hydroxy protecting groups. This reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature in the absence of a solvent, for example at 800 to 170 , preferably 120 to 140 , or in a solvent at an elevated temperature, for example at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The choice of solvent is affected by solubility characteristics of the reactants and the particular meaning of Q.Preferably the solvent is pyridine, a picoline or mixture of picolines, lower alkanol, preferably ethanol or l propanol, an aqueous mixture of a lower alkanol, 1,2 ethanediol, a ketone, for example acetone or 2 bùtanone, or a polar aprotic solvent for example dimethylf ormamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulphoxide, hexamèthylphosphoramide, sulpholane, acetonitrile or nitromethane. Particularly preferably Q is nitroamino and the reaction is carried out in reflexing ethanol, reflexing 1propanol or reflexing pyridine, or Q is methylthio and the reaction is carried out in ref fluxing pyridine. Preferably approximately equimolar amounts of the reactants are used, although an excess for example a slight excess of from 1. 1 to 1. 5 molar equivalents or a larger excess of from 1.5 to 4 molar equivalents, of either reactant can be used. If an excess of a reactant is used then preferably an excess of the amine of Structure 2 is used.An excess of either reactant can be present at the start of the reaction or can be added during the course of the reaction. Examples of hydroxy protecting groups are methoxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, arylmethyl, for example benzyl, lower alkyl, for example methyl, and acyl, for example formyl or acetyl. Compounds of Structure 1 in which Hetl is a 2 , 4 or 6 hydroxypyridyl group can be conveniently prepared from a compound of Structure 3 in which Het2 is a pyridyl group with a 2 ,4 , or 6 lower alkoxy substituted by acid hydrolysis of the product of the reaction with an amine of Structure . The compounds of Structure 3 in which Q is nitroamino can be prepared by reacting a B oxoester of Structure 4 EMI4.1 in which Z is hydrogen or lower alkyl, R is lower alkyl, A is as defined for Structure , and Het3 is a pyridyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, or a pyridyl group substituted by hydroxy, a protected hydroxy group, or N oxo and optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy with nitroguanidine, and when Het3 is a pyridyI group optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, reacting the product with an oxidising agent to give a N oxopyridyl derivative, and optionally removing any hydroxy protecting group present. The compounds of Structure 3 in which Q is lower alkylthio or benzylthio canbe prepared by reacting a oxoester of Structure 4 in which Het3 is a pyridyl group substituted by hydroxy, a protected hydroxy group or N oxo, and optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, with thiourea, and alkylatingorbenzylatingthe2 thiouracil formed, and optionally removing any hydroxy protecting group present. The compounds of Structure 3 in which Q is chlorine or bromine can be prepared by reacting a B oxoester of Structure 4 with guanidine and diazotising the product in hydro chloric acid in the presence of cuprous chloride or in hydrobromic acidinthe presence of cuprous bromide, and when Het3 is a pyridyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, reacting the product with an oxidising agent to give a N oxopyridyl derivative, and optionally removing any hydroxy group present. Preferably the reactions of the B oxoester of Structure 4 with nitroguanidine, thiourea and guanidine are carried out in the presence of a base, for example, an alkali metal lower alkoxide, preferablysodiummethoxide, or sodium ethoxide, an alkali metal carbonate or hydroxide, preferably potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide, for example benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide. Preferably this reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature, for example the reflux temperature of the solvent mixture. Preferably the solvent is a lower alkanol, for example ethanol, an aqueous mixture of a lower alkanol, a ketone, for example 2 butanone, or a polar aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide. When Z is hydrogen the B oxoester ofStructure . 4 can be used in the form of a hemiacetal of a lower alkanol. Preferablyaperoxycarboxylic acid, for example 3chloroperoxybenzoic acid, peroxybenzoic acid or peracetic acid is used as the oxidising agent to convert a pyridyl group into a N oxo pyridyl group. Preferably this oxidation is carried out in acetic acid. The amines of Structure 2 in which Y is sulphur can be prepared by reacting cysteamine with a compound of formula Het CH2L where L is a group displaceable with a thiol, for example hydroxy, acyloxy for example acetoxy, methanesulphonyloxy or p toluenesulphtonyloxy , lower alkoxy for example methoxy , chlorine, bromine or triarylphosphonium for example triphenylphosphonium . Preferably L is hydroxy or methoxy and the reaction is carried out under tidic conditions, for example in hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. The amines of Structure 2 in which Y is methylene andHet is a 2 pyridyl group with a lower alkoxy group or halogen atom in the 3 position can be prepared by reacting a 2 halo3 nitropyridine with diethyl 2 2 cyanoethyl malonate.Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the product followed by reduction with palladium and charcoal gives a 3 amino 3 3cyanopropyl pyridine which can be diazotised in 2M sulphuric acid and alkylated in dimethyl sulphoxide to give a 3 alkoxy2 3 cyanopropyl pyridine. The 3 amino 2 3 cyanopropyl pyridines can be reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give a 4 3 amino 2 pyridyl butylamine which can be diazotised in strong hydrochloric acid in the presence of cuprous chloride to give a 3 chloro amine, or diazotised in strong hydrobromic acid in the presence of cuprous bromide to give a 3 bromo amine, or diazotised in dilute sulphuric acid containing sodium iodide to give a 3 iodo amine.The 3 amino 2 3 cyanopropyl pyridines can be diazotised in fluoroboric acid and reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give a 4 3 f luoro 2 pyridyl butylamine. The amines of Structure 2 in which Y is methylene andHet is a 2 thiazolyl group can be prepared by reacting a thioamide of structure NE2CS CH2 4Q where Q is a protected amino group with a dialkyl acetal of bromoacetaldehyde and removal of the amino protecting group. The esters of Structure 4 can be prepared by alkylating a dialkyl malonate followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation, or by condensing an aldehyde with malonic acid and decarboxylating, esterifying and reducing the product. The compounds of Structure l have histamine H2 antagonist activity and also have histamine H1 antagonist activity and are particularly active as histamine H2 antagonists when compared to analogous compounds in which Hetl is other than a pyridyl ring substituted by hydroxy or N oxo. The compounds of Structure l also have a low lipophilicity as measured by octanol water distribution. In this specification by histamine H2 receptors is meant receptors defined by Black et al. Nature, 236, 385 1972 as those histamine receptors which are not blocked by mepyramine but are blocked by burimamide, and by histamineH1 receptors is meant receptors involved in mepyraminesensitive histamine responses. Compounds which block histamine H receptors are referred to as histamine H2antagonists and compounds which block histamine H1 receptors are referred to as histamine H1 antagonists. Blockade of histamine H2 receptor,s is of value in inhibiting the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by histamine H1 antagonists. Histamine H2antagonists are active, for example, as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, as antiinflammatory agents and as agents which act on the cardiovascular system, for example as inhibitors of the effects of histamine on blood pressure. In some physiological conditions the biological actions of histamine are mediated through both histamine H1 and H2receptors and blockade of both types of receptors is useful. These conditions include inflammation mediated by histamine, for example skin inflammation, and those hypersensitivity responses due to the action of histamine atH1 and H2 receptors, for example allergies. The activity of the compounds of Structure 1 as histamine H2 antagonists can be demonstrated by the inhibition of histamine stimulateS secretion of gastric acid irom the lumen perfused stomachs of rats anaesthetised with urethane, at doses of less than 16 micromoles per kilogram intravenously. This procedure is referred to in Ash andSchild, Brit. J. Pharmac. Chemother. 27, 427 1966 . Their activity as histamine H2 antagonists can also be demonstrated by their ability to inhibit other actions of histamine which, according to the above mentioned paper of Ash and Schild, are not mediated by histamine H1 receptors. For example, they inhibit the actions of histamine on the isolated guinea pig and and isolated rat uterus.They inhibit the basal secretion of gastric acid and also that stimulated by pentagastrin or by food. In a conventional test such as the measurement of blood pressure in the anaesthetised cat, at doses of from 0.5 to 256 micromoles per kilogram intravenously they inhibit the vasodilator action of histamine. The potency of these compounds is illustrated by the effective doses producing 50 inhibition of gastric acid secretion in the anaesthetised rat and the dose producing 50 inhibition of the histamine induced tachycardia in the isolated guinea pig atrium less than 10 Molar . The activity of the compounds of Structure 1 as histamine H1 antagonists can be demonstrated by the inhibition of histamine stimulated cbntractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum. It is advantageous to administer a single compound having histamine H1 and H2 antagonist activity rather than to administer individual compounds having histamine H1 antagonist activity and histamine H2 antagonist activity as difficulties arising from differing rates of absorption and pharmacokinetic characteristics are avoided. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise a pharmaceutical carrier and a pharmacologically active compound of Structure l which can be in the base form or in the form of an addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Such addition salts include those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulphuric and maleic acids and may conveniently be formed from the corresponding compounds of Structure l by standard procedures, for example by treating them with an acid in a lower alkanol or by the use of ion exchange resins to form the required salt either directly from the compound in the base form from a different addition salt. The pharmaceutical carried employed can be a solid or liquid. Examples of solid carriers are lactose, maize starch, potato starch, or modified starches, dicalcium phosphate, terra alba, sucrose, celluloses, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, aicohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols and water. If a solid carrier is used, the composition can be prepared in the form of a tablet, capsule containing powder or pellets, troche or lozenge. The amount bf solid carrier in a unit dosage form is generally from about 25 mg to about 300 mg.. If a liquid carrier is used, the composition can be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, multiple emulsion, sterile injectable liquid or an aqueous or non aqueous solution or liquid suspension. Other additives such as preservatives, for example antioxidants or antibacterials, and or flavouring or colouring agents can also be included. The sterile liquids can be prepared in ampoules, multidose vials or unit dose disposable systems. The preparation can also be in a semi solid form, for example a cream, paste, ointment or gel, or in a liquid or aerosol form for topical application.The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques involving procedures such as milling, mixing, granulating and compressing, spray drying, freeze drying or dissolving or dispersing the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation.The active ingredient is present in the compositions in an effective amount to block histamine H2 receptors.Preferably, each dosage unit contains the active ingredient in an amount of from about 50 mg to about 250 mg. The active ingredient is preferably administered one to six times per day. The daily dosage regimen is preferably from about 150 mg to about 1500 mg. The route of administration can be oral or parenteral.
