# ACCUMULATING CHAIN CONVEYOR

## Abstract
An accumulating chain conveyor includes a plurality of accumulation zones zone 2, 3, 4 . . . , each having prefer ably a pair of load carrying chains, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 . . . seperate and independent of the load carrying chains of ad jacent zones. Each load carrying chain constitutes a contin uous closed loop within its respective zone, and is capable of being driven independently of the load carrying chains of other zones. Improved load sensors 85 are provided to eliminate false signals due to discontinuous load surfaces.
