# Specific binding assay method, reagent system and labelled conjugate for use in this method.

## Abstract
An improved specific binding assay, e.g., homogeneous or heterogeneous immunoassay, for determining an analyte employing a labeled conjugate of said analyte and a photogenic, e.g., fluorescent, label. Where the analyte in the analyte photophor conjugate whose light emission is mea sured in the assay as a function of the analyte is capable of significantly reducing such light emission upon coming into quenching orientation with the photophor, the present invention employs a labeled conjugate in which the analyte is joined to the photogenic label by a linking group which substantially hinders such quenching orientation. In this manner, ten percent or more of the photogenicity of the unconjugated photophor can be preserved in the measured analyte photophor conjugate. The use of conventional flexi ble linking groups in the labeled conjugate allows quenching to occur with attendant large losses in assay sensitivity, whereas sensitivity is increased in the present invention by the use of relatively rigid linking groups. The invention is applicable to a wide variety of photogenic, e.g., fluorescent and chemiluminescent, binding assay techniques.

## Description
SPECIFIC BINDING ASSAY METHOD, REAGENT SYSTEM AND LABELED CONJUGATE FOR USE IN THIS METHOD BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The development of specific binding assay techniques has provided extremely useful analytical methods for determining various organic substances of diagnostic, medical, environmental and industrial importance which appear in liquid mediums at very low concentrations. Specific binding assays are based on the specific interaction between the substance under determination, herein referred to as analyte, and a binding partner thereof. Where one of the analyte and its binding partner is an antibody and the other is a corresponding hapten or antigen, the assay is known as an immunoassay.Other binding interactions between the analyte and a binding partner serve as the bases of binding assays, including the binding interactions between hormones, vitamins, metabolites, and pharma geological agents, and their respective receptors and binding substances. In conventional specific binding assay techniques, a test sample to be assayed is combined in a liquid reaction mixture with reagent systems of various compositions. Such systems usually comprise i a labeled conjugate, which is a conjugate of the analyte, or a specific binding analog thereof, and a labeling substance, and ii a limiting amount of a binding partner for the analyte. In the reaction mixture then, analyte in the sample and labeled conjugate compete for binding to the binding partner resulting in formation of a binding partner boundspecies and a free species of the labeled conjugate.The relative amount or proportion of the labeled conjugate that results in the bound species compared to the free species is a function of the presence or amount of the analyte in the test sample. One can thus measure the labeling substance in the free species and correlate the measured. amount with the presence or amount of the analyte in the sample. Where the labeled conjugate in the bound species is essentially indistinguishable in the presence of the labeled conjugate in the free species by the means used to monitor the label, the bound species and the free species must be physically separated in order to complete the assay. This type of assay is referred to in the art as heterogeneous . Where the boundspecies and free species forms of the labeled conjugate can be distinguished in the presence of each other, a homogeneous format can be followed and the separation step avoided. The present invention relates to homogeneous and heterogeneous specific binding assay methods and reagent systems for the quantitative or qualitative determination of an analyte in a test sample involving the use of photogenic labels, e.g., chemiluminescers and fluorescers. In particular, this invention relates to such methods and systems of the homogeneous type, particularly those employing fluorogenic enzyme substrate active labels. The present invention additionally relates to photogen and photophor labeled conjugates used in such assay methods and reagent systems. 2. DESCRIPTIOW OF H PRIOR ART The first highly sensitive specific binding assay to be discovered was the radioimmunoassay which employs a radioactive isotope as the label. Such an assay necessarily must follow the heterogeneous format since the monitorable character of the label is qualitatively unchanged in the free and bound species.Because of the inconvenience and difficulty of handling radioactive materials, assay systems have been devised using materials other than radioisotopes as the label component, including cofactors, enzyme substrates, enzyme modulators, e.g., activators and inhibitors, cycling reactants, spin radicals, enzymes, bacteriophages, metals and organometallic complexes, organic and inorganic catalysts, prosthetic groups, chemiluminescent reactants, and fluorescent molecules. Among such specific binding assay techniques are those which employ photogenic labels, most noteably, chemiluminescers and fluorescers. In such assays, the free species of the labeled conjugate yields an analyte photophor conjugate comprising the analyte or its analog linked to a photophor capable of emitting light upon excitation by appropriate means. The sensitivity of such an assay is dependent on the ability to photogenically measure the photophor label without interference from the analyte or analog portion of the conjugate. If the analyte or its analog in the conju gate is of a type which can significantly diminish the photogenicity of the photophor label when proximate to the photophor, the sensitivity of any assay for such an analyte would suffer greatly. It is an object of the present invention to provide a means for al leviating such analyte induced quenching of photogenic labels employed in certain specific binding assays, particularly those of the homogeneous type. Homogeneous photogenic enzyme substrate labeled specific binding assays are described by Burd et aZ, AnaZ. Biochem. 77 56 1977 and in German OLS 2,618,511 and British Pat.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improvement in specific binding assays employing photogenic labels for the determination of analytes which have the capacity to quench light emission from analyte photophor conjugates either used in or generated during the assay.The improvement is accomplished by employing a labeled conjugate in which the analyte or its analog is joined to the photogenic label by a linking group which substantially hinders i.e., disallows to a significant degree quenching orientation of the photophor with the analyte or analog portion in the analyte photophor conjugate whose light emission is measured in the assay. The invention is applicable to any type of homogeneous or heterogeneous specific binding assay, most particularly homogeneous immunoassays, wherein the assay is monitored, i.e., a detectable signal is correlated with analyte in the sample tested, by measuring light emission from a photophor, particularly a fluorescer, conjugated chemically to a quenching analyte or analog thereof.The analyte photophor conjugate whose light emission is measured may be identical with the photogenic labeled conjugate combined as an assay reagent with the test sample or may be a product of a chemical reaction involving such photogenic labeled conjugate reagent, e.g., the product of enzyme modification of the photogenic labeled conjugate. The sensitivity of photogenic specific binding assays is markedly improved when the linking group hinders the quenching mode between the photophor and analyte portions of the conjugate sufficient to observe 10 , more preferably 15 , and most preferably 20 , of the photogenicity of the unconjugated photophor in the conjugate. Alleviation of analyte induced quenching is accomplished by including in the linking group a portion of sufficient rigidity to substantially restrict the rotational degrees of freedom between the analyte and the photophor.

ANALYE The present assay may be applied to any analyte detectable by photogenic specific binding assay methods and which exhibits undesirable quenching of the photophor in the measured analyte photophor conjugate. The propensity of an analyte to quench a particular photophor can be assessed by Stern Volmer studies Stern andVolmer, Z. Phys. 20 183 1919 and Vaughan and Weber,Biochem. 9 464 1970 . In such studies, increasing concentrations of a potential quencher are added to a constant level of the unconjugated photophor and the effect on fluorescence is monitored. The analyte usually is a peptide, polypeptide, protein, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, steroid, or other organic molecule for which a specific binding counterpart exists in biological systems or can be synthesized. The analyte, in functional terms, is usually selected from the group comprising antigens and antibodies thereto haptens and antibodies thereto and hormones, vitamins, metabolites and pharmacological agents, and their binding counterparts.Usually, the analyte is an immunologically active polypeptide or protein, usually having a molecular weight of between about 1,000 and about 10,000,000, such as an antibody or antigenic polypeptide or protein, or a hapten having a molecular weight of at least about 100, and usually less than about 1,i00.

QUENCHING EFFECT The present invention is predicated on the use of linking groups that hinder, i.e., prevent or inhibit to an analytically significant degree, quenching of the photogenicity, i.e., the ability to emit light upon excitation, of the photophor in the measured analytephotophor conjugate by the analyte or analog portion of the conjugate. The analyte induced quenching effect can be based on any physical, chemical or electrical interaction between the photophor and the analyte portion and is usually based on intramolecular modulation, particularly that due essentially to either direct intramolecular collision or resonance energy transfer. Interaction between the photophor and the analyte portion results in photophor quenching when the analyte portion assumes a proximate quenching orientation with the photophor. 1. Direct IntramoZecuZar Collision In this quenching phenomenon, modulation of the photogenicity of the photophor can result from static or dynamic processes. Static quenching results when the photophor and quencher interact prior to excitation of the photophor, whereas dynamic quenching results from interaction with the excited photophor whereby the quenching mechanism competes wit emission for depopulation of the excited state. Dynamic and static quenching require short range collision or contact interaction between the photophor and quencher. The principles of direct intramolecular collision quenching are described in the literature . Vaughan e.t .ai Bicohem. 9 464 1970 and have been applied to analytical chemistry EGuilbault, FZuares cence Instrumentation and Practice, Decker NewYork 1967 p. 349J, the study of membrane proteins Shinitzky et aZ, Biochem. 16 982 1977 , the investigation of liposome cell interactions Weinstein et aZ, Science 195 489 1977 , and enzyme assays Yaron et aZ, Anal. Biochem. 95 228 1979 . Tncorporation of a quenching analyte or analog into the labeled conjugate such that a high frequency of collisions with the photophor is allowed to occur provides a system exhibiting direct intramolecular collision quenching.Selection of a linking group which restrains movement of the opposed photophor and analyte portions of the conjugate reduces the frequency of collisions and thereby relieves photophor quenching by this mechanism. Quenching by direct intramolecular collision is particularly prone to occur between the photophor and analyte portions of the conjugate where both parties are aromatic in character. Strong ring to ring interactions become likely to occur, leading to molecular stacking configurations which promote quenching. Additionally, when the analyte contains heavy atoms, the enhanced rate of intersystem crossing to the triplet state which competes with fluorescence decay can lead to quenching. 2. Resonance energy transfer In this mechanism, energy is transferred from the photophor to a quencher over an intramolecularly long distance, as long as 60 , but preferably less than 25 . The theory of resonance energy transfer has been established by Forster, Ann. Phys. 2 55 1943 . Uniie direct intramolecular quenching, efficiency of quenching due to resonance energy transfer is dependent upon the spectral overlap of the emission spectrum of the photophor with the absorption spectrum of the quencher. This quenching phenomenon has been applied to enzyme assays Yaron et aZ, Canal. Biochem. 95 228 1970 and immunoassays Ullman et aZ, J. Biol. Chem. 251 4172 1976 and U.S.Patent No. 3,996,345i. Selection of a linking group which restricts the ability of the opposed photophor and analyte portions of the conjugate to come sufficiently close for resonance energy transfer to occur results in relief of photophor quenching by this mechanism. Accordingly, the phrase quenching orientation is used herein to be generic to the quenching mechanisms of direct intramolecular collision and resonance energy transfer. PHOTOGENIC LABELED CONJUGATE The labeled conjugate refers to the reagent entity combined with the test sample and the other assay reagents, which conjugate comprises the analyte, or a specific binding analog thereof, and a photogenic label. By photogenic label is intended a material which itself is a photophor, i.e., is itself capable of light emission upon excitation, or is a precursor of a photophor, i.e., is a residue which upon chemical reaction is modified to produce a hotopllor. Thus, the photogenic labeled conjugate reagent Ina be identical with the photophor analyte conjugate whose photogenicity is measured to complete the assay or may be a precursor thereto. If it is a precursor, the labeled conjugate will undergo chemical reaction, usually enzyme catalyzed, which modifies the photogenic label portion to render it a photophor. For example, a nonfluorescent fluorescer derivative coupled to an analyte or analog would serve as a fluoro genic labeled conjugate if upon chemical reaction a fluorescent fluorescer analyte conjugate is generated. The photophor in the measured analyte photophor conjugate can be any molecular entity which can be stimulated to emit light by exposure to excitation means of any physical, chemical, or electrical nature, e.g., irradiation with light or exposure to chemical reaction. The principal categories of the photophor are fluorescers, phosphorescers, and chemiluminescers. Fluorescers and phosphorescers are molecules which upon irradiation with light of a predetermined first wavelength emit light of a second, longer wavelength. Chemiluminescers emit light upon chemical reaction which may or may not be enzyme catalyzed. Examples of useful fluorescers are umbelliferone 7 hydroxycoumarin , fluorescein, indole, ss naphthol, 3 pyridol, resorufin, lissamine rhodamine B, rhodamine B, anthracene, 3,10 diphenylanthracene, perylene, rubrene, pyrene, tryptophan, flavin, acridine, naphthalene, a naphthylamine, 5 dimethylamino l naphthalenesulfonate dansyl , N p 2 benzoxazoyl phenyl maleimide, thiochrome, anilinosulfonic acid, and their various fluorescent derivatives. Examples of phosphorescers are quinoline, l bromonaphthalene, indole, tryptophan, tyrosine, and their various phosphorescent derivatives. See Meyers et aZ, Anal. Chem.51 1609 1979 . Examples of useful chemiluminescers are luminol, isoluminol, luciferin, 2,3 dihydrobenzo g phthalazine 1,4 dione, 2,3 dihydrophthalazine l,4 dione, and their various chemiluminescent derivatives. LINKING GROUPS As in conventional labeled conjugates, the photogenic label and the analyte, or its analog, will be joined covalently by a chain comprising from 1 to SO atoms, more commonly 1 to 30 atoms, and usually 1 to 20 atoms, excluding hydrogen, principally carbon and heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur. Conventional linking groups are described at length in the literature. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,230,797 4,279,992 3,817,837 3,935,074 and 3,996,345. The present invention departs from convention in selecting a relatively rigid or only partially flexible residue for insertion into such conventional linking groups in order to impart sufficient rigidity to significantly reduce quenching interaction between the photophor and analyte portions. Once aware of the solution afforded by the present invention to the potential quenching problems bf the prior art, one skilled in the art will have a variety of chemical groupings and residues from which to choose to impart the desired rigidity to the conventional linking groups.A sampling of such groupings and residues are provided below Linking arm type Structural examples piperazinylene, particularly the depicted N,N substituted form phenylene, particu larly the depicted para substituted form cyclohexylene, par ticularly the depicted 1,4 substituted form carbocyclic and hetero cyclic fused ring systems, e.g., naph thalenes, anthracenes, et aZEMI15.1 Linking arm type Structural examples acetylene bis substituted monosaccharides bicyclo 2.2.2 octane rod, J.

ASSAY TECHNIQUES In broad principle, the present invention is applicable to any homogeneous or heterogeneous specific binding assay technique which employs a labeled conjugate comprising a photogenic label and the analyte or an analog thereof. In any such technique, if the analyte is of a type which can quench the photogenic label, the total potential signal from the analytephotophor conjugate measured in the assay will be correspondingly reduced, thereby decreasing the sensitivity of the assay, i.e., the lower limits of analyte concentrations that can be reproducibly detected.A. Homogeneous Formats Generally speaking, the present assay method involves the steps of 1 combining the test sample in a liquid reaction mixture with a reagent system including a binding partner for the analyte and the labeled conjugate as described herein, resulting in the formation in the reaction mixture of a binding partner bound species and a free species i.e., not bound by binding partner of the labeled conjugate, the free species yielding the analyte photophor conjugate either as the labeled conjugate itself labeled conjugate, the free species yielding the analyte photophor conjugate either as the labeled conjugate itself or as a reaction product from the labeled conjugate , and 2 exciting the photophor by appropriate means and measuring the resulting light emitted as a function of the analyte in the test sample.Following are examples, without limitation, of particular homogeneous assay techniques to which the present invention applies 1. Enzyme substrate ZabeZed technique In this system, the labeled conjugate comprises the analyte or analog and a photogenic, e.g., fluorogenic, enzymeesubstrate active label, wherein such label is capable of being acted on by an enzyme to produce the analyte photophor conjugate. The ability of the enzyme to act on the labeled conjugate to release the detected analyte photophor conjugate is decreased by binding of the labeled conjugate with the binding partner recognizing the analyte commonly an antibody or a fragment thereof . Assay systems of this type are included in the principle described in commonly assigned, copending applicationSerial No. 894,836, filed April 10, 1978 corresponding to U.K. Pat.Spec. 1,552,607 . In such enzyme substrate labeled techniques, the labeled conjugate, e.g., a substrate analyte conjugate, will have the property that it can be acted upon by an enzyme, by cleavage or modification, to produce a product having a detectable property which distinguishes it from the conjugate. For example, the conjugate may be nonfluorescent under assay conditions but upon reaction with enzyme a fluorescent analytefluorescer product is produced. Various fluorogenic substrate labeled conjugates are evident for use in such techniques. For example, the labeled conjugate may be of the formula G D R L wherein G is a cleavable grqup such as phosphate, carboxylate, or glycone, D is a fluorogenic dye moiety which upon removal of G yields a fluorescent product, e.g., D can be umbelliferone, fluorescein, rhodamine, and their derivatives, R is the linking group and L is the analyte or analog thereof. Enzymatic cleavage e.g., by phosphatase, carboxylase, glycosidase, etc. of the labeled conjugate is affected by binding, such as by antibody, to the analyte L portion of the conjugate. See U.S. Pat.No. 4,279,992. A particularly preferred substratelabeled assay scheme employs a labeled conjugate of the type EMI20.1 wherein R and L are as above, whereby the ability of the enzyme ss galactosidase to cleave the conjugate yielding a product distinguishable by its fluorescence is inhibited by binding of the conjugate with antibody. An example of a rigid portion inserted into linking group R for the purposes of the present invention is para phenylene, yielding conjugates of the general formula EMI21.1 wherein R1 and R2 are appropriate bridging elements.Conjugates of this general type are represented by the specific structure 4 EMI21.2 where R3 is an appropriate bridging element. e.g., a bond or a chain of from 1 20 atoms excluding hydrogen, and L is as above. Conjugates of this type can be prepared as outlined in Scheme A. Here, 7 ss galactosylcoumarin e carboxylic acid 1 Burd et aZ, CZin. Chem 23 1402 1977 can be converted to the activated ester 2 by reaction with N hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in DMF at room temperature for hours Anderson et aZ, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 86 1839 1964 . The activated ester 2 is then combined in a suitable solvent, such as DMF, with para aminobenzoic acid in the presence of triethylamine and stirred for 24 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture is then filtered to remove the byproduct dicyclohexyl urea and the Scheme AEMI22.1 solvent evaporated under high vacuum to give a residue from which pure N para carboxyphenyl 7 ss galactosylcoumarin 3 carboxamide, 3 , can be obtained, for example, by chromatography on silicic acid and eluting with ethanol ethyl acetate mixtures. Label 3 can be attached to an amino modified or aminocontaining ligand by appropriate amide and peptide bond forming reactions c.f. Peptides Goodman andMeienhofer, ed., John Wiley 4 Sons New York 1977 , pp. 6 13 and references cited therein . Another example of a rigid portion inserted into linking group R for the purpose of the present invention is l,4 disubstituted cyclohexyl, yielding conjugates of the general formula EMI23.1 wherein R1 and R2 are appropriate bridging elemants. Conjugates o f this general type are represented by the specific structure 5 EMI24.1 where R3 is an appropriate bridging element, e.g., a bond or a chain of from 1 20 atoms excluding hydrogen, and L is as above. Conjugates of this type can be prepared by reacting the activated ester 2 with trans 4 aminomethyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid, under the conditions described for the synthesis of 3 , to give the acid N trans 4 carboxycyclohexylmethyi 7 8 galactosylcoumarin, 6 . Label 6 can be attached to amino containing or amino modified ligands EMI24.2 by appropriate amide and peptide bond forming reactions. A particularly preferred rigid portion inserted into linking group R for the purposes of the present invention is N,N piperazinylene, yielding conjugates of the general formula EMI25.1 wherein R1 and R2 are appropriate bridging elements.Conjugates of such general type which have been found to be particularly useful are those of the following structure EMI25.2 wherein m and n are integers as described in the examples which follow R3 is an appropriate bridging element, e.g., a bond or a chain of from 1 20 atoms, excluding hydrogen, and L is as above. Conjugates of this type are particularly exemplified in the experimental section which follows. 2. Fluorescence quenching or enhancement The labeled conjugate in this system is composed, in its label portion, of a fluorescer whose fluorescence is quenched or enhanced in some measurable degree when the labeled conjugate is bound by antibody. The fluorescent label is usually measured directly, with its fluorescence being the detectable signal. Assay systems of this type are described inU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,940,475 4,150,949 4,160,016, 4,160 ,818 and 4,272,505 in U.K. Pat. Spec. 1,583,869 and in J. CZin. Path. 30 526C1977 , as well as the other references cited hereinabove. 3. Fluorescence polarization The label in this system is also a fluorescer however, the affected characteristic is polarization of fluorescence due to binding of the labeled. conjugate by antibody. Assay systems of this type are described in J. Exp. Med. 122 1029 1975 and in the references cited hereinabove. 4. Energy transfer In this system, the label is one member of an energy transfer donor acceptor pair and the antibody is conjugated with the other of such pair. Thus, when the labeled conjugate is bound by antibody, the energy expression of the donor component of the pair is altered by transfer to the acceptor component. Usually, the donor is a fluorescer and the acceptor is a quencher therefor, which quencher may or may not be a fluorescer as well. In such embodiment, the detectable signal is fluorescence, but other detectant systems are possible also. Such assay systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,996,345 4,174,384 and 4,199,559 and in U.K. Pat. Spec. 2,018,424 as well as the references cited hereinabove. 5. ChemioaIZy ezeited fluorescence In this system, the label is again a fluorescer, however, the ability of the fluorescer label to be chemically excited to an energy state at which it fluoresces is affected by binding of the labeled conjugate with antibody. Chemical excitation of the label is usually acdomplished by exposure of the fluorescer label to a high energy compound formed in situ. Assay systems of this type are described in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,195. .6. Double antibody steric hindrance Another assay system is the double antibody immunoassay system described in U.S. Pat, Nos. 3,935,074 and 3,998,943. The labeled conjugate comprises two epitopes, one of which participates in the immunological reaction with the ligand and ligand antibody and the other of which is bindable by a second antibody, with the restriction that the two antibodies are hindered from binding to the labeled conjugate simultaneously. The second epitope can be a fluorescent substance whose fluorescence is quenched by the second antibody binding, or may participate in an ancillary competitive binding reaction with a labeled form of the second epitope for binding to the second antibody. Various detectant systems are possible in such a system as described in the aforementioned patents. Related assay systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,130,462 and 4,161,515 and in U.K. Pat. Spec. 1,560,852 as well as the other references cited hereinabove. B. Heterogeneous Formats The present assay method can also be applied to the conventional heterogeneous type assay techniques wherein the bound and free species of the labeled conjugate are separated and the label component in one or the other is determined. The reagent means for performing such a heterogeneous assay can take many different forms. In general, such means comprises three basic constituents, which are 1 the analyte to be detected, 2 a binding counterpart of the analyte and 3 the labeled conjugate.The binding reaction constituents are combined simultaneously or in a series of additions, and with an appropriate incubation period or periods, the labeled conjugate becomes bound to its corresponding binding partners such that the extent of binding, i.e., the ratio of the amount of labeled conjugate bound to a binding counterpart the bound species to that unbound the free species , is a function of the amount of analyte present. The bound and freespecies are physically separated and the amount of label present in one thereof is determined by exciting the photophor by appropriate means and measuring the resulting light emitted. The measured emission can be compared to a negative control or standard results, e.g., a standard curve. Various means of performing the separation step and of forming the binding reaction systems are available in the art. Separation can be accomplished by such conventional techniques as those involving what is commonly known as a solid phase antibody or antigen, a second antibody, or a solid phase second antibody, as well as the use of immune complex precipitation agents, absorbents, and so forth. Binding reaction systems that can be followed include the so called competitive binding technique, the sequential saturation technique, the sandwich technique, and so forth. Further details concerning the various known heterogeneous systems are readily available in the literature, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,720,760 3,940,475 3,992,631 4,058,732 4,133,639 4,144,452 4,171,311 4,201,763 and 4,230,797 and J. Pharm.Sci. 70 469 1981 and the articles cited therein. It is contemplated that manipulative schemes involving other orders of addition and other binding reaction formats can be devised for carrying out homogeneous and heterogeneous specific binding assays without departing from the inventive concept embodied herein. REACTION MIXTURE AND CONDITIONS The test sample to be assayed can be a naturally occurring or artificially formed liquid suspected to contain the analyte, and usually is a biological fluid or a dilution thereof. Biological fluids that can be assayed include serum, plasma, urine, saliva, milk, and amniotic and cerebrospinal fluids. The binding reaction will in almost all cases be allowed to proceed under mild conditions. The reaction mixture will be in general an aqueous medium with any desirable organic cosolvents being present in minor amounts. The temperature of the reaction will be maintained at a constant level in normal circumstances throughout the incubation period and the measurement step. Temperatures will generally be between 5 and 500C, more usually between 20 and 400C.Preferably, the reaction will proceed at room temperature. The pH of the reaction mixture will vary between 5 and 10, more usually between 6 and 9. The concentration of various reagents will depend on the level of analyte expected in the test medium, with such level usually being between 10 3 and 10 As in the case of the previously described reaction parameters, selection is primarily based on empirically derived optimization balanced against the preferences and needs of the technician who will ultimately perform assays on a routine basis. None of the parameters therefore is of a critical nature to the present invention, rather thay are all within the ordinary skill in the art.

The above described synthesis of the ss galactosyl umbelliferone piperazinyl quinidine conjugate III can be modified to yield conjugates wherein, independently, m and n 2 through 9 by replacing 1 2 hydroxyethyl 4 2 trifluoroacetamidoethyl piperazine with the appropriate synthetic intermediate represented by general formula C in Diagram 1, whereG represents an appropriate amine protecting group.To obtain intermediates such as C, piperazine can be reductively alkylated with 1 equivalent of a suitably protected ss aminoaldehyde A. The resulting mono Diagram 1EMI37.1 substituted piperazine B can be converted to intermediateC by common organic chain forming reactions. For example, B can be alkylated with the species X CH2 n Y where X is a leaving group such as bromo, chloro, ptoluene sulfonyl, methanesulfonyl and where Y is either itself a leaving group or a functional group such as hydroxyl or acetoxy which can, in one or more steps, be transformed into a leaving group.Bi functional intermediates such as X CH2 Y are well known in organic chemistry, being obtainable by simple chemical transformations from the class of alpha, omega dihydroxyalkanes or the alpha, omega halohydrins. c.f., Chem. Sources USA , 1979 ed., DirectoriesPublishing Co., Flemington, NJ In general, alkylation of mono substituted piperazines B with reactants X CH2 Y where both X and Y are leaving groups will be less preferred because of the necessity of closely controlling reaction conditions in order to avoid over alkylation of the piperazine ring. The transformation of B to c can also be achieved by the reductive alkylation of B with omega substituted aldehydes Y CH2 n 1 CHO Borch et al., J. Amer.

B. Relative fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime studies. Relative fluorescence intensity was determined on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer SLM Instruments, Inc.,Urbana, IL with excitation wavelength set at 405 nanometers nm and emission wavelength set at 445 nin. Fluorescence lifetimes were determined by means of the cross correlation phase and modulation fluorometer described by Spencer and Weber, Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 158 361 1969 . The fluorescence of a population of fluorescent molecules is affected 1 by the static quenching due to molecular interactions in the ground state before excitation and 2 dynamic quenching of the excited singlet state due to interactions throughout the excited singlet lifetime. Measurements of lifetimes and fluorescence in the absence and in the presence of quencher would yield y, the degree of dissociation of the nonfluorescent complex at the time of the excitation since y To T Fo F where To and FO are the lifetime and fluorescence in the absence of quencher and T and F in the presence of quencher. The dynamic Stern Volmer rate constant, kt which is the bimolecular rate constant for the quenching encounter when the fluorophore is in the excited state, is given by k 1 t 1 to sec 1 while the equilibrium constant of association for complex formation in the ground state, Ka is given by Ka l y 1 . Spencer and Weber in Structure and Function of Oxidation Reduction Enzymes, ed. Akeson et al, Pergamon Press New York 1972 pp. 393 399 . The results are shown in Table A. The fluores cence data was collected for the fluorescent umbelliferone quinidine products of S galactosidase cleavage of the four labeled conjugates I I V shown in Fig. 1 and for a fluorescent umbelliferone derivative designated RAS that was unconjugated to analyte.

No. 4,273,715 The relative quantum efficiencies for the umbelliferone fluorescence in the umbelliferone derivative and in the 4 umbelliferone quinidine compounds indicate that the umbelliferone fluorescence in the umbelliferone quinidine compounds are quenched to different extent Table A . Compounds I and II onl vr exhibit 5.28 and 4.3 , respectively, of the expected umbelliferone fluorescence, while Compounds TII and IV exhibit 42.4 and 31.2 , respectively.The lifetimes for the umbelliferone fluorescence in the umbelliferone derivative and in the four umbelliferone quislidine compounds are also shown in Table A. Further, the Table A data, which lists the calou lated kinetic and equilibrium parameters, indicates that a At 260C in Bicine buffer, pH 8.5, the umbelliferone quinidine compounds with an alkyl chain of 4 and 12 methylene groups exist mainly 93 and 95 in I and II, respectively as an internally stayed form. Introduction of a rigid piperazine linking arm reduces the stacked form to 42 and 58 in III and IV with 4 and 10 methylene groups, respectively. b The intramolecular interaction between umbelliferone and quinidine is stronger when the linkage is flexible K a 0.7 in III and 1.4 in IV . The 14 and 19 fold decrease in the equilibrium constant of association between umbelliferone and quinidine, when the rigid piperazine link ing arm is introduced, is concluded to be due to the destabilizing effect of the rigid arm. c Although the dynamic rate constants for the 4 umbelliferone quinidine compounds ranging from 0.6 x 105 to 1.2 x 105 sex 1 are low, they are as expected nearly identical because dynamic quenching is solely a diffusion phenomenon.
