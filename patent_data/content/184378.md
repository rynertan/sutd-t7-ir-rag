## Description
This invention relates to video display systems and, more particularly, to improvements in the type of video display which employs a deformable layer having deformations that depend upon a stored charge pattern and an optical subsystem for converting the deformations into a viewable image. There have been previously set forth techniques for displaying video information by storing a charge pattern representative of a video frame in a frame store and utilizing the charge pattern to modify a characteristic of a material. The modified characteristic of the material is then used to obtain a viewable image. For example, in U.S. Patent US A 3,882,271 there is disclosed a system called a solid state light modulator wherein a charge pattern on a special array of semiconductor devices is used to obtain deformations of a conductive reflective layer disposed over the array and spaced therefrom by an elastomer material such as silicone gel. An optical subsystem, such as a Schleiren optical system, can then be utilized to convert the pattern of deformations or ripples in the reflective layer into a viewable image. There is a unique combination of problems associated with the structure of the semiconductor devices of the described type of solid state light modulator system. A substantial range of voltages must be applied to the individual device electrodes in order to achieve a substantial range of deflection forces on the reflective layer that is separated from these electrodes by a deformable material. For dynamic images, such as in television presentations, the video signals need to be read into the individual deflection electrodes at a fairly high rate. For the device to have good temporal responsiveness, the video representative signals must be read into the electrodes of the individual semiconductor devices and maintained for a desired period of time at appropriate spacings and amplitudes, all within the constraints of a practical array having a large number of small elements which can be manufactured in quantity at a reasonable cost. US A 4229732 discloses an intergrated structure including a display device, addressing circuitry, and semiconductor control logic. The display comprises a thin film micromechanical electrostatic form of light reflective display formed by depositing thin films upon a silicon wafer and selectively etching to form metal amorphous oxide micromechanical leaves deflected by applying potential thereto to provide electrostatic deflection. In accordance with an embodiment of a method of the invention, a technique is provided for displaying images using a display apparatus of the general type set forth. An embodiment of the method includes applying, during one field of a video frame, a reference potential to even rows of devices and the input video signal to odd rows of devices and applying, during the other field of a video frame, a reference potential to odd rows of devices and the input video signal to even rows of devices. By applying this reference potential e.g. ground reference potential to every other row of devices, and having each field of video information persist for one field duration rather than one frame duration on the solid state light modulator, a distinct advantage in dynamic resolution is achieved for moving objects of low spatial resolution. In one form of the invented method, the applying steps include reading, during the lines of one field of a video frame, alternating samples of input video signal and reference potential into a register in one order, and applying the samples from the register alternately into two successive rows of devices and reading, during the lines of the other field of a video frame, alternating samples of input video signal and reference potential into a register in opposite order, and applying the samples from the register alternately into two successive rows of devices. In another form of the invented method, the applying steps include reading, during the lines of one field of a video frame, samples of input video signal into a first register and reference potential into a second register, and applying the samples from the register respectively into two successive rows of devices and reading, during the lines of the other field of a video frame, reference potential into the first register and samples of video signal into the second register, and applying the samples from the registers respectively into two successive rows of devices. In both of these disclosed forms, the available transfer time of a new signal into a given semiconductor device is substantially an entire scanline time, by virtue of using extra registers in each case. In accordance with still another form of the invented method, there is provided a technique whereby greatly reduced signal voltages can be used to obtain the necessary elemental deflections of the conductive reflective layer. In this form of the method, a bias potential, preferably a negative potential, is applied to the conductive reflective layer. During one field of a video frame, the input video signal is applied to the electrodes of even rows of devices, and a reference potential e.g. ground is applied to the electrodes of odd rows of devices, the reference potential being different than the bias potential. During the other field of a video frame, the input video signal is applied to the electrodes of odd rows of devices, and the reference potential is applied to the electrodes of even rows of devices. The method also has application in embodiments where isolation conductors are disposed between the electrodes of the devices, and the reference potential is applied to the isolation conductors. Some examples of methods and apparatus according to the invention will now be described in conjunction with known apparatus with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a simplified schematic diagram of the type of apparatus 10 in which the improvements of the invention are made. A semiconductor substrate 11 has an array of devices formed in a surface 12 thereof, these devices serving as semiconductor controlled storage units. A layer of deformable material 13 which may be, for example, an elastomer such as silicone gel covers the surface 12, and a reflective layer 14 of conductive material is disposed over the deformable layer 13. The semiconductor device array, and associated circuitry 80, both to be described in detail hereinbelow, receives and samples a video signal, the samples ultimately being stored as a charge pattern on the surface 12 of semiconductor 11. The electric field associated with the charge pattern results in a force with respect to the layer 14 which deforms the deformable material 13 and layer 14 so that information is contained in the reflective layer 14 in the form of depressions or ripples which are similar to a phase diffraction grating. This information is then displayed on a screen 15, such as by using a Schlieren type of optical system. The optical system depicted in Fig. 1 is generally of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent US A 3,084,590 and US A 3,882,271. In this system arc electrodes 20 generate an intense light source that is directed by a curved mirror 21 over a masking system 22 which includes a plurality of reflecting bars 23 separated by transparent areas or slits 24. The masking system 22 is positioned so that the light reflected from the bars 23 is transmitted toward a lens 25 where it is focused into parallel rays. These rays are incident on the deformed reflective surface 14 and are reflected back through the lens 25 toward the masking system 22. If, at a given instant, there were no depressions on the surface 14 to divert the light rays, the rays effectively emanating from each bar 23 would be focused by lens 25 on the same bar and no light would be incident on the screen 15. However, if there are depressions in the surface 14 they will act as diffraction gratings and some light will be diffracted and ultimately pass through the slits 24. The portion of the light rays transmitted through a particular slit depends on the amplitude of the infinitesimal diffraction grating from which the ray was diffracted. Thus, an appropriate pattern of diffraction gratings, resulting from a selected charge pattern, will yield a desired image on the screen 15. The charge pattern is stored by the array of semiconductor devices, to be described, in the semiconductor substrate 11. In embodiments hereof, the array of semiconductor devices is arranged in a diagonal pattern, and the Schleiren bars are also oriented diagonally. Reference to prior art light modulator systems can be made to the abovereferenced U.S. Patent US A 3,882,271 which is a forerunner hereof, and also to U.S. Patent US A 4,441,791 which is of a different type in that it discloses a deformable mirror mounted on a grid over an array of semiconductor devices to form air gap capacitors. Deformations of the mirror surface can be converted into an image by an optical system. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown an array of devices in semiconductor substrate 11. In the diagram of Fig. 2, each device or element 100 is illustrated by its deflection region 300, which is shown as being a square in the present embodiment, the squares being oriented and arranged in a diagonal pattern i.e., with the deflection electrodes of each row of the array being offset horizontally with respect to its adjacent rows. In the Fig. 2 embodiment, the lines of elements 100 are numbered at the right of the Figure as line 1, line 2, etc., and illustrative elements from a central exemplary portion of the array are shown in Fig. 3 which shows a small portion of four consecutive lines designated using the generalized terminology of line j, line j 1, line j 2, and line j 3. In Fig. 2, the columns of the array are numbered as column 1, column 2, column 3, etc., and in Fig. 3 the columns from a central examplary portion of the array, are designated as column k, column k 1, column k 2, and column k 3. Each element of a column of the array is coupled in common, in a manner to be described, to a common column conductor 150 for that line, as seen in Fig.s 2 and 3. As seen in Fig. 2, the respective column conductors are coupled to respective sides of capacitors Co, the other sides of which are coupled to ground reference potential. These and other groups of capacitors can be considered as storage registers, and it will be understood that suitable analog registers or digital registers in conjunction with conversion circuitry The row conductors 330 are coupled to respective outputs of shift register 220, the outputs of register 220 being used to selectively enable the row conductors in sequence. The register 220 is clocked by the horizontal synchronizing signal, and is synchronized by the vertical synchronizing signal, V. At the beginning of each field, a signal derived from V is used to load the first stage of the shift register 220 with a logical 1 high level. At each horizontal scanline of the field, the logical 1 level is shifted to the next position in the register so that the row conductors are sequentially enabled, one line at a time. In operation of the system of Fig.s 2 and 3, a scanline of sampled video information is read sequentially into the capacitors C1 in alternation with ground reference potential. At the end of the scanline, a signal derived from the horizontal sync signal H is used to enable switches 160, so that the sampled video information and gnd, as the case may be in the capacitors C1 is coupled to respective capacitors Co and the respective column conductors 150. This substantially stores the sampled elemental signals in capacitors Co where they are applied, during the next scanline and while the next line of video information is being read into the respective capacitors C1 , to the respective column conductors. The signal derived from H is also operative, at this time, to shift the register 220 so as to enable the next row conductor for the duration of the next line. It can be noted that the capacitors C1 and Co are charged or discharged, as the case may be through low impedances, so they can be charged in the relatively short durations during which their respective switches are enabled. Each elemental signal can now be transferred into the respective deflection electrodes 300, in a manner to be described further hereinbelow, of the two successive lines whose common row conductor has been enabled by the output of the register 220. It will be recalled that every other signal level entered in capacitors Co was at ground reference potential. Therefore, the video signal samples for the given scanline will be transferred into the respective deflection electrodes of one of the lines associated with the enabled row conductor, and ground reference potential will be transferred into each of the deflection electrodes of the other line which shares the energized row conductor. Thus, for example, in Fig. 2, if the enabled row conductor is the one which is shared by lines 3 and 4, during an odd field the sampled video signals will be transferred into the respective deflection electrodes 300 of line 3, and ground reference potential will be transferred into the deflection electrodes 300 of line 4. As explained above, during the next field of video information an even field , the capacitors C1 will be loaded with ground reference potential and the video signal in opposite order as compared to the previous field, so that ground reference potential will be transferred into the deflection electrodes 300 of line 3, and the sampled video signals will be transferred into the deflection electrodes 300 of line 4. During the transfer from the input capacitors Co to the respective deflection electrodes of the lines associated with the enabled row conductor, which occurs during approximately one scanline period, the next scanline of video information is being read into the capacitors C1 again, in alternation with ground reference potential . In this manner, substantially a full scanline duration is available for transfer of the signal from the capacitors Co into the capacitance associated with the respective deflection electrodes. In particular, this capacitance comprises the capacitor formed by each deflection electrode 300 and the common electrode 14 e.g. Fig.s 1 and 3 disposed above the deformable material which is shown at ground reference potential in the present embodiment, but which can be preferably operated at a negative bias voltage, as described hereinbelow , and stray capacitance. The impedance in each column conductor between the input capacitor and its associated deflection electrodes can be caused to vary in accordance with the change in video signal level from frame to frame, so as to achieve video noise reduction. Fig.s 3 and 4 illustrate the configuration, in the present embodiment, of the devices 100 formed in the semiconductor substrate. The substrate is n type silicon, and the regions 310 and 320 are spaced p type diffusions, for example boron diffusions. The regions 310 are coupled to associated column conductors 150. The regions 320 are coupled to the respective deflection electrodes 300. An insulating region 325, typically a silicon dioxide layer, covers the semiconductor region between diffusions 310 and 320. The respective row conductors 330 are disposed above oxide layers 325, of the devices of their associated rows and serve as gates which, when energized or enabled, cause p channel conduction between the regions 310 and 320 so that the signals on the column conductor lines are effectively coupled to the deflection electrodes 300 of the devices on the enabled rows. The deflection electrodes 300 have top flat regions which extend over their associated devices and are spaced therefrom by insulating material such as silicon dioxide 329. The row switching, at the line rate of operation, permits advantageous use of polysilicon, while the faster column switching employs metal conductors in the present embodiments. The polysilicon rows interfere less with adjacent or crossing components than would equivalent metal conductors. The p channel devices avoid problems of avalanche breakdown which could occur with n channel operation if relatively high operating voltages were employed. Also, the spacing between regions 310 and 320 is selected to avoid so called punch through breakdown from occurring when the device is supposed to be turned off. The embodiment of Fig.s 2 4 illustrates one way of having a means for entering a reference potlential such as ground reference potential in alternating fields of elements, thereby, inter alia, enhancing the dynamic resolution of the display. In the embodiment of Fig.s 2 4, it is seen that the system clock rate used to clock the sampled video signal into the storage capacitors and ultimately into the array is twice the rate at which video information is being entered. This is because half the time is being used to clock ground reference potential into every other horizontal element of a line, as described above. In the embodiment of Fig.s 5 and 6, a clock rate can be used which is the same as the rate at which information is entered into the array i.e., half the clock rate of the previous embodiments, for the same Size array. As seen in Fig. 5, the device display electrodes are in the same general configuration as in Fig. 2. The row conductors 530 are coupled to the outputs of a shift register 520, and operate like their counterparts in Fig. 2 to sequentially enable row pairs of devices. The column conductors 551 of the odd columns are coupled to circuitry similar to that of Fig. 2 namely, to respective capacitors C2a, respective switches 560 that are again enabled by a signal derived from the horizontal sync signal H, respective capacitors C2b, and respective switches 565 which are enabled by respective outputs of shift register 580, which is clocked at the basic system clock rate and operates to successively enable the switches 565. The input to switches 565 is the output of a switch 585 which passes the input video signal during odd video fields and passes ground reference potential during even video fields. The even column conductors 552 are coupled to similar circuitry which includes respective capacitors C3a, respective switches 570 that are enabled by a signal derived from the horizontal sync signal H, respective capacitors C3b, and respective switches 575 which, again, are sequentially enabled by respective output stages of a shift register 590 which is clocked at the basic system clock rate and operates to successively enable the switches 575. The input to switches 575 is the output of a switch 595 that is operative to pass the input video signal during even video fields and ground reference potential during odd video fields of a video frame. As above, the groups of capacitors, such as C2a, C2b, C3a and C3b can be considered as storage registers which, in the present embodiment, are operative to store and transfer a line of sampled video signal or ground reference potential, as the case may be . In the present embodiment, the clock rate used can be half of that which was employed in the Fig. 2 embodiment, since the odd and even subsystems are utilized simultaneously to read in and transfer sampled input video signals and ground reference potential as the case may be into respective odd and even rows of the array devices. In operation of the embodiment of Fig. 5, during an odd video field the switch 585 is operative to pass the input video signal so that, for example, during the first video scanline the input video signal is sampled, under control of shift register 580, and stored in capacitors C2a. Simultaneously, switch 595 is passing ground reference potential, which is being read into capacitors C3a under control of shift register 590. At the end of the first scanline, the switches 560 and 570 are momentarily enabled to transfer the signals from capacitors C2a into respective capacitors C2b, and to transfer the signals from capacitors C3a into capacitors C3b. The first row conductor 530, which is coupled to the devices of lines 1 and 2 of the array as in the previous embodiment is also enabled and remains enabled during the next scanline, during which the sampled video signals or ground reference potential, as the case may be in capacitors C2b and C3b are transferred into the respective display electrodes of lines 1 and 2 of the array. During the next video field, the odd and even line conductors and their associated circuits reverse roles by virtue of switching the status of switches 585 and 595 and ground reference potential is transferred into line 1 while the sampled video signal is transferred into line 2. It will be understood that a separate switching arrangement, such as for directly switching ground reference potential to the appropriate activated row, could be used. This would be a more efficient way of applying the grounds, but would require additional switching circuitry. Fig. 6 illustrates a system like the Fig. 1 system, but utilizing an array and associated circuitry such as was described above, and diagonally oriented Schleiren bars 623. In the Fig. 6 illustration, the Schleiren bars are oriented at about 45 degrees with respect to the vertical axis of the image. The Schleiren bars can alternatively be in a checkerboard pattern, e.g. shown in Fig. 7 on a curved surface, or a combined vertical and diagonal pattern. In Fig. 8 there is shown a diagonal crossing pattern of grounded isolation conductors surrounding the devices of the array. These conductors, which can be permanently grounded or at another reference potential, as described below, are illustrated in Fig. 4 by reference numeral 70. In the diagram of Fig. 10, there is shown a portion of the previously described devices namely deflection electrodes 300A and 300B, deformable layer 13, and conductive reflective layer 14. The feature of the invention to be described has application in configurations wherein there are isolation conductors, at a fixed reference potential, around each deflection electrode e.g. Fig. 8 or where the adjacent electrodes reverse roles, during alternating fields, with regard to which one has a fixed reference potential applied e.g. Fig. 5 . Assume for the time being that 300B is fixed at ground reference potential although it will be understood that it can switch roles with 300A during alternate video fields, as previously described . In Fig. 10, ground reference potential is also illustrated as being conventionally applied to the conductive reflective layer 14. The input video signal applied to deflection electrode 300A is designated Vd. The force exerted on layer 14 is proportional to the square of the voltage between it and its opposing electrode. The degree of deflection of layer 14, at a given position can be expressed as the difference in force exerted by adjacent electrodes such as 300A and 300B. Accordingly, in Fig. 10 the deflection would be proportional to Vd 0 Vd . In the arrangement of Fig. 11 an improvement in deflection sensitivity, as a function of the applied voltage, is obtained by applying a bias potential to layer 14 that is different than the reference potential applied to electrode 300B. In the present embodiment, the deformable layer 13 is an elastomer such as a silicone gel. There is some conduction of charges in the gel, and the positive and negative charges are not equally mobile. Accordingly, there will be residual charges in the gel, and these charges will be positive charges. It is therefore advantageous to operate with the conductive reflective layer 14 at a negative potential, since, with this polarity, the field strength and thus the force will be greater at the layer 14, where the residual positive charges in the gel oppose the applied negative bias potential. In Fig. 10 the electrode 300B is at a reference potential which, in the present embodiment is ground reference potential. A bias potential Vb is applied to conductive reflective layer 14, and the input video signal applied to electrode 300A is again designated Vd. The deflection in this case will therefore be proportional to Vd Vb ² Vb², which is seen to be greater than in the Fig. 10 case. Negative bias voltages of 50 volts, or more negative, can be employed to advantage. We have noted that an additional phenomenon improves the device sensitivity. For higher bias fields there is a reduction in the effective restoring force, thereby improving sensitivity. If one calculates the energy in the field which is 1 2 CV² at each electrode it is seen that there is less energy when the conductive reflective layer is rippled than when it is flat. For higher fields, the surface tries to get longer rather than shorter, which is like having a negative surface tension. This force opposes the normal restoring force and tends to improve the effective sensitivity. This has been verified experimentally. The following table illustrates the applied signal voltage Vd measured required for full deflection in one experimental device, for different negative bias voltages, Vb. The righthand column shows the predicted signal voltage assuming a constant force required for full deflection that force being the force resulting from 60 volts of applied voltage adjacent 0 volts, in this example , as computed from the above difference of force deflection relationship As the magnitude of the bias voltage is increased, it is seen that the predicted signal voltage necessary for full deflection is decreased first and third columns of the table . From the second column, it is seen that at higher bias voltages the sensitivity is substantially better than predicted from the difference of force relationship, thereby confirming that there is a reduction in restoring force as the layer 14 ripples. If the bias voltage is made large enough, the sensitivity gets extremely high, but the surface will eventually shrivel up , as the negative surface tension exceeds the restoring force. Fig. 12 shows another arrangement wherein a negative bias voltage Vb for example 70 volts is again applied to the layer 14, but a smaller negative reference voltage Vr for example 10 volts is applied to electrode 300B. In this case the applied video signal Vd is adjusted to be in a range covering negative to positive values for example 10 volts to 10 volts . This may be done, for example, by subtracting 10 volts from a sampled input signal that was originally in the range 0 volts to 20 volts. This arrangement can again also be utilized, if desired, in the form hereof where the adjacent electrodes switch roles during alternating fields with regard to which one has a fixed reference potential applied. An advantage of the Fig. 12 arrangement is the reduction of the necessary voltage magnitude in the semiconductor chip e.g. where the substrate is maintained at ground reference potential. In the example of Fig. 12 the voltage magnitude in the chip would be 10 volts as compared to a 20 volt voltage magnitude within the chip for a signal voltage in the range 0 volts to 20 volts, with the substrate again at ground . The arrays of semiconductor devices hereof can be fabricated, for example, utilizing known semiconductor lithographic processes. Appropriate masks for the patterns of diffusions, electrodes, contacts, polysilicon and conductive layers, etc., are designed and utilized in sequences of selective diffusions, layer deposition, selective etching, electrode deposition, etc. in the requisite order, as known in the art . The deformable layer 13 and conductive and reflective layer or layers 14 can be applied using techniques set forth, for example, in copending U.S. Patent USA A 4529620. The invention has been described with reference to particular preferred embodiments, but variations are possible. For example, a diagonal pattern of deflection electrodes can have alternative configurations and or arrangements, such as is illustrated by electrodes 300 in Figure 9.
