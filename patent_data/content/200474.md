# Process for regenerating coke contaminated catalyst.

## Abstract
Particulate catalyst which has been used in a hydrocar bon conversion process such as catalytic reforming is regenerated in a moving bed regeneration zone 12 . The catalyst being regenerated is passed into the top of the zone 12 and slowly moves downward as a dense bed 14, 19, 20 which is contacted successively with an oxygen containing gas stream 31 , a temperature adjusting gas stream 30 and either a drying gas stream 37 or a chlorination gas stream 39 or both at different elevations within the regeneration zone 12 . A key feature involves employing a portion of relatively hot combustion gas 26 withdrawn from one portion of the zone 12 as the temperature adjusting gas stream 30 in a different portion of the zone after compress ion, with the remainder of the compressed combustion gas 27 being cooled 32 and recycled to the combustion zone as the gas stream 31 . This eliminates the need to employ a heater to provide a suitable heating gas stream.
