# PROCESS FOR SEPARATING ETHANOL FROM DILUTE AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS THEREOF

## Abstract
Ethanol is separated from dilute aqueous solutions thereof by bringing the aqueous solution into contact with a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite which is a high silica zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio in the range from 12 1 to 300 1, preferably from 40 1 to 60 1.
