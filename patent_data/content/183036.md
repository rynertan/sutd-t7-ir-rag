# BRAKES, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A friction brake element, such as a friction brake disc, comprises a light alloy substrate having a working face overlayed by a wear resistant layer containing silicon carbide dispersed in a matrix of, e.g., copper diffusion bonded to the substrate. The layer may conveniently be diffusion bonded to the substrate and also densified by the use of hot isostatic pressing techniques.
