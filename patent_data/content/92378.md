# Position control apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A position control system of closed loop configuration in which a position detector IDS is provided on a motor driven machine element ME for sensing the position thereof and a rotary encoder REC is provided on the shaft of the motor MT for detecting the roatational speed thereof by producing pulses of a frequency proportional to the rotational speed. The system includes means PCC for controlling position based on a position detection signal from the position detector IDS and a motor position signal from the rotary encoder REC , and means VCC for controlling speed based on a rotational speed signal from the rotary encoder REC and an output from the position control means PCC .
