# Resolution standard for scanning electron microscope and method of producing such a standard.

## Abstract
A resolution standard for a scanning electron micros cope consists of spiked clusters of palladium formed on a molybdenum substrate. The clusters are widely scattered so that a cluster can be acquired easily for a resolution test. The tips of the spikes on the clusters are of the order of 50 Angstroms and they present a sharp clear image to an electron microscope that is operating properly. The palladium clusters can be formed by treating the cleaned surface of a molybdenum substrate with an aqueous solu tion of palladium chloride.
