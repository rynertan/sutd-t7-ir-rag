# Ethylene recovery from ethyl acrylate process.

## Abstract
Unreacted ethylene contain in a gaseous light ends stream derived from a process for the production of ethyl acry late by the reaction of ethylene with acrylic acid in the pres ence of a sulfuric acid catalyst, is recovered by intimately con tacting, under controlled conditions of temperature and pres sure, the light ends stream with the liquid sulfuric acid catalyst make up stream which is passed to the ethyl acrylate process. Upon contact of the light ends stream with the sulfuric acid make up stream, the ethylene reacts with sulfuric acid to form ethyl hydrogen sulfate and diethyl sulfate, both of which remain in solution in the sulfuric acid which is then passed to the ethyl acrylate process as a source of make up sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide contained in the vent gas stream is not absorbed into the sulfuric acid, and therefore not recycled to the ethyl acry late process.
