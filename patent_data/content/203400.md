# Preparation of 4 5 hydroxymethyl 5 4 methylimidazole.

## Abstract
4 5 Hydroxymethyl 5 4 methylimidazole MHI is pre pared by a process comprising the steps of a reacting 4 methylimidazole MI with from 1.05 to 1.1 moles of formaldehyde or an equivalent amount of paraform aldehyde per mole of MI, in a concentrated aqueous NaCl solu tion in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a strong inorganic base, at a temperature from about 20 to about 60 C b neutralizing the reaction mixture with concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid to a pH of 8.5 8.9 to obtain a precip itate of MHI free base and c separating the precipitate thus obtained from the aqueous solution and washing it with cold water or acetone. The MHI free base thus obtained can further be converted to an acid addition salt thereof.
