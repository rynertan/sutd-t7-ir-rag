# Improved method for explosive blast control.

## Abstract
An improved method of blast suppression involves forming an expanded foam barrier maintained in position by a barrier element which, in a preferred form, is inflated and maintained inflated by the foam used to form the foam barrier. Various barrier structures and methods are disclosed for suppression of the blast wave.
