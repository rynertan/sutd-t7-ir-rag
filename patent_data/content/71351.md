# A transferred arc plasma reactor for chemical and metallurgical applications.

## Abstract
A transferred arc plasma reactor is disclosed. The reac tor comprises a bottom portion 10, 12, 14 defining a crucible for collecting molten material 18 , an anode 22 adapted to contact the molten material 18 in the crucible, a sleeve 26 mounted on top of the crucible and electrically insulated therefrom, a cathode assembly including a cathode 36 mounted on top of the sleeve and electrically insulated therefrom, means 66 for introducing feed material con veyed by a carrier gas near the top of the sleeve 26 so that the material is fed against the inner wall of the sleeve 26 , melted under the heating energy radiated by a plasma arc 64 formed between the cathode 36 and the molten material to form a falling film of molten material which flows down along the inner wall of the sleeve 26 and drops into the crucible underneath, and outlet ports 68 in the bottom portion of the reactor for exiting the carrier gas and the non reacted plasma forming gas.
