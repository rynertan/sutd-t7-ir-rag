## Description
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS AND THEIR PHARMACEUTICAL USE This invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as pharmaceuticals. The compounds of the invention have the formulaEMI1.1 in which R1 is hydrogen or C1 6 alkyl, R2 is hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl or C36 alkenyl, X is CR CR or CH2 n where n is 1 to 3, and Y is CN orEMI1.2 and salts thereof. Compounds of the above formula I , with the exception of those in which Y is CS which are intermediates in the preparation of the remaining compounds, are inhibitors of leukotriene action, and are thus indicated for use in a variety of pharmacological conditions. For example, they may be used in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of immediate hypersensitivity diseases including asthma and in the alleviation of status asthmaticus. In the above formula I reference to a C 6 alkyl 1 group includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and tert. butyl, and is preferably methyl, ethyl or propyl. A C3 6 alkenyl group includes, for example, allyl, isopropenyl, butenyl, isobutenyl and 3 methyl 2 butenyl, and is preferably allyl. Preferred groups of compounds of formula I are those in which R1 is C14 alkyl, R2 is C1 4 alkyl and X is CR CR or CE2 n where n is 2 or 3. It will be appreciated that compounds in which X is CR CR exist in stereoisomeric Z and E forms such as followsEMI2.1 Since the active compounds of formula I bear a tetrazolyl group, an opportunity exists of forming base addition salts, and such salts are included as part of the present invention. Examples of such salts are those derived from ammonium hydroxide and alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, as well as salts derived from aliphatic and aromatic amines, aliphatic famines and hydroxy alkylamines.Bases especially useful in the preparation of such salts include ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, methylamine, diethylamine, ethylene diamine, cyclohexylamine and ethanolarnine. The potassium and sodium salt forms are particularly preferred. Apart from pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, other salts are also included within the scope of the invention since they may serve as intermediates in the purification of compounds or in the preparation of other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or they may be useful for identification, characterization or purification of the free compound. The pharmaceutical compounds of the invention may be prepared by reacting the intermediate of the formulaEMI3.1 where R1, R2 and X have the values given above, with an azide.Compounds of formula II are novel and form part of the present invention. The process is preferably carried out in an organic solvent such as a polar aprotic solvent, for example dimethyl formamide, and suitably at a temperature in the range of from 20 C to 1500C, for example, from 900C to 1200C. The azide employed can be, for example, an alkali metal azide such as sodium azide, and we have found that a combination of alkali metal azide and ammonium chloride is especially convenient. As mentioned above, if it is desired to produce theE isomer of the compound in which X is CR CR the Z isomer prepared by reaction of azide with nitrile compound of formula II can be irradiated using intense light, optionally with for example diphenyl disulphide as radical source. Alternatively, the Z isomer is prepared from the appropriate compound of formula II with Z configuration. Compounds of formula II may be prepared by condensing an appropriate phenol reactant of the formulaEMI4.1 with a nitrile intermediate of the formula EMI5.1 where Z is halo, especially bromo, in a suitable organic solvent and in the presence of an alkali metal hydride such as for example sodium hydride. In their turn, compounds of formula IV can be prepared from derivatives of the formulaEMI5.2 where n is 1, 2 or 3, which are prepared by reaction of 4 cyanobenzaldehyde with the appropriate triphenylphosphonium bromide derivative, with optional subsequent reduction. The compounds of the present invention are pharmacologically active, being inhibitors of leukotriene action as shown by the following tests a the in vitro test on guinea pig ileum segments at concentrations of from 10 ng to 50 pg, according to the method of Schild, 1947 Brit. J. Pharm. 2 197 206, using LTD4 as the antagonist the pharmacological compounds of the following Examples exhibited an IC50 against LTD4 of less than 10 4 molar b the in vivo Guinea Pig Pulmonary Function Test of Austen and Drazen 1974 J. Clin.Invest. 53 1679 1685 at intravenous dosage levels of from 0.05 pg to 5.0 mg kg and c a modified Herxheimer test, Journal of Physiology London 117 251 1952 , at doses of from 25 to 200 mg kg. The Herxheimer test is based on an LTD4 induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs which closely resembles an asthmatic attack in man. The compounds also inhibit the formation of leukotrienes, as indicated by their action in the test described by Harvey and Osborne, Journal of Pharmacological Methods 9 147 155 1983 . The compounds are accordingly indicated for therapeutic use in the treatment of diseases in which leukotrienes are implicated. These include immediate hypersensitivity diseases, allergic reactions of the pulmonary system in which leukotrienes are thought to be causal mediators of bronchospasm, for example, in allergic lung disorders such as extrinsic asthma and industrial asthmas such as Farmers lung and Pigeon Fanciers lung, and in other inflammatory disorders, for example, associated with acute or chronic infectious diseases such as allergic skin diseases, ectopic and atopic eczemas, psoriasis, contact hypersensitivity and angioneurotic oedema, bronchitis and cystic fibrosis and rheumatic fever. The compounds may be administered by various routes, for example, by the oral or rectal route, by inhalation, topically or parenterally, for example by injection, being usually employed in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.Such compositions form part of the present invention and are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and normally comprise at least one active compound in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. In making the compositions of the present invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, and or enclosed within a carrier which may, for example, be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. Where the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semi solid, or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient.Thus, the composition may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, aerosols as a solid or in a liquid medium, ointments containing for example up to 10 by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, injection solutions and suspensions and sterile packaged powders. For administration by inhalation, particular forms of presentation include aerosols, atomisers and vaporisers. Some examples of suitable carriers are lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl and propyl hydroxybenzoate, talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil. The compositions of the invention may, as is well known in the art, be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient. Where the compositions are formulated in unit dosage form, it is preferred that each unit dosage form contains from 5 mg to 500 mg, more usually 25 to 200 mg, of the active ingredient. The term unit dosage form refers to physically discrete units suitable as unit dosages for human subjects and animals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The active compounds are effective over a wide dosage range and for example dosages per day will normally fall within the range of 0.5 to 300 mg kg. and in the treatment of adult humans, more usually in the range of from 5 to 100 mg kg.However it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound to be administered and the chosen route of administration and therefore the above dosage ranges are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. The following Examples illustrate the invention.EXAMPLE 1 E, Z 1 Methoxy dimethyl methoxy 3 4 cyanophenyl prop 2 ene To a suspension of 2 methoxy dimethyl methoxy ethyl triphenylphosphonium bromide prepared by the method of E.J.Corey et al.
