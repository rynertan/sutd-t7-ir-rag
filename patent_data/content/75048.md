# Heat recovery.

## Abstract
System in which low grade heat i.e. recovered latent heat is recoverable for low temperature heating loads, separately from superheat energy for high temperature loads. The system includes a countercurrent heat exchan ger 18 located between the condenser 14 and com pressor 10 of a refrigeration plant, heat engine or like device recovered superheat from the exchanger being con ducted to high temperature load 24 and recovered latent heat from the exchanger being led to a low temperature load 24 by heat transfer medium circulated through the heat exchanger and loads by a pump 22 .
