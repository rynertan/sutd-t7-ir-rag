# A high frequency filter.

## Abstract
A high frequency filter for frequencies higher than the VHF band comprising a closed conductive housing 53 , a pair of input and or output means 54 like an antenna provided at both the extreme ends 53 5, 53 6 of said housing 53 , a plurality of resonators 51 1 through 51 5, and 51a 1 through 51a 5 arranged on a straight line between said antennas 54 , each of said resonators having an elongated inner conductor 51a 1 through 51a 5 with a circular cross section, and an elongated rectangular dielectric body 51 1 through 51 5 sur rounding said inner conductor, one end of each of said resonators being fixed at the single plane 53 1 of the housing 53 and the other end of each of said resonators being free standing. The length of said inner conductor and the dielectric body is substantially 1 4 wavelength, and the distance 52 1 through 52 4 between two resonators is determined accord ing to the specified coupling coefficient for the desired charac teristics of the filter. Due to the rectangular dielectric body 51 1 through 51 5 , each resonator is stably mounted on the housing 53 , and then, the stable characteristics of the filter is obtained. Thus, the use in a vibrated circumstance like a mobile communication is possible. That rectangular dielectric body 51 1 through 51 5 also provides the larger coupling coefficients between resonators, and then, the wideband filter can be obtained.
