# COMBUSTION CHAMBER STRUCTURE FOR DIESEL ENGINES.

## Abstract
In a combustion chamber structure for a direct ejection type Diesel engine, a guide wall 34 , which is formed so that the inner diameter thereof increases gradually from an open edge portion 33 of a combustion chamber 32 to the lower end of the wall 34 , and fuel reflecting walls 36, 38 , which are formed under the guide wall 34 so as to project toward the axis â‚€ of the combustion chamber 32 and thereby divide the combustion chamber 32 into upper and lower portions. i.e. first and second combustion chamber portions 44,48 , are provided for the purpose of reflecting the atomized fuel in the combustion chamber 32 effectively in accordance with the displacement of a piston 30 and mix the atomized fuel with air sufficiently in the combustion chamber 32 or a cylinder 28 . This arrangement can prevent an outflow of flames, which causes the flames to be cooled, from the combustion chamber 32 , which is opened at a top portion 30a of the piston 30 , to a quench zone Q, and the concentration of the atomized fuel in a lower portion of the combustion chamber 32 .
