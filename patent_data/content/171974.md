# Multi type heat sensitive transferring medium.

## Abstract
A multi type heat sensitive transferring medium com prises a substrate and a heat sensitive transferring ink layer overlying the substrate and comprising a resin component, a solid component immiscible with the resin component and capable of becoming liquid by heating while solid at room temperature, and a coloring agent, the resin component being a a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer having a monomer weight ratio of vinyl chloride to vinyl acetate of from 65 35 to 90 10 and having a viscosity average degree of polymerization of 200 1000, or b a polymethacrylic acid ester having a viscosity average degree of polymerization of 100 3000, or c a mixture of a and b .
