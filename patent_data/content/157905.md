# Semiconductor device.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor device according to the invention, first and second voltage dropping circuits 100, 200 for generating voltages Vin1, Vin2 respectively having smaller values than that of an external power supply voltage Vext are provided. The first voltage dropping circuit 100 which consumes relatively less power is always in an operative mode, and the second voltage dropping circuit 200 which consumes more power than that of the first voltage dropping circuit is operated during an interval other than a standby interval. The voltages Vin1, Vin2 generated by the first and second voltage dropping circuits 100, 200 are supplied to an internal power supply line 12 in parallel with each other.
