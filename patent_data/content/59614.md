The stabilizer compositions of this invention may be prepared by blending the components thereof in any convenient manner which produces a homogeneous mixture, such as by shaking or stirring in a container. Likewise, the stabilizer compositions of this invention can be incorporated into the halogen containing organic polymer by admixing the stabilizer composition and polymer, such as, for example, in an appropriate mill or mixer or by any other of the well known methods which provide uniform, distribution of the stabilizer throughout the polymer. As previously stated, the stabilizer compositions of the present invention comprise 1 a mono organotin compound or mixture of mono organotin compounds, 2 a mercaptancontaining organic compound or mixture of mercaptancontaining compounds, and, optionally, 3 a diorganotin compound or mixture of diorganotin compounds. More particularly, the stabilizer compositions of this invention comprise from about 10 to about 60 by weight, preferably about 20 to about 40 by weight mercaptan cpntaining organic compound. or mixture of mercaptan containing organic compounds, based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, the balance of the stabilizer composition comprising a mono organotin compound or mixture of mono organotin compounds, and, optionally, a diorganotin compound or mixture of diorganotin compounds.Thus, when no diorganotin compound or mixture of diorganotin compounds is employed in the practice of this invention, the mono organotin compound or mixture of mono organotin compounds will comprise from about 40 to about 90 by weight, preferably about 60 J to about 80 by weight of the total weight of the stabilizer composition. When it is desirable to utilize a diorganotin compound or mixture of diorganotin compounds in the practice of this invention, said diorganotin compound or mixture of diorganotin compounds may comprise from about 0.05 to about 75 by weight, preferably from about 0.05 to about 35 by weight of the total weight of the stabilizer composition. The stabilizer compositions of this invention are employed in an amount sufficient to impart the desired resistance to heat deterioration to halogen containing organic polymers. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, that the precise amount of stabilizer composition used will depend upon several factors, including, but not limited to, tne particular halogen containing organic polymer employed, the temperature to which the polymer will be subjected, and the possible presence of other stabilizing compounds. In general, the more severe the conditions to which the halogen containing organic polymer is subjected, and the longer the term required for resisting degradation, the greater will be the amount of stabilizer composition required.Generally, as little as about 0.40 parts by weight of the stabilizer composition per hundred parts by weight of halogen containing organic polymer will be effective. Qihile there is no critical upper limit to the amount of stabilizer composition which can be employed, amounts in excess of about 10 parts by weight of stabilizer composition per hundred parts by weight of halogen containing organic polymer do not give an increase in effectiveness commensurate with the additional amount of stabilizer employed. The articles of manufacture contemplated by this invention are produced from the stabilized polymer compositions according to this invention. These articles of manufacture, e.g. pipe,may be formed from said stabilized polymer compositions by any of the well known, conventional techniques for forming polymers into shaped articles of manufacture. The following examples illustrate this invention.Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages in the examples and throughout this specification are by weight.
