# Fluid powered actuator system.

## Abstract
The system includes two identical fluid powered actuators 10A, 10B operable by respective supply pressures P1, P2 which are controlled by respective identical valve arrangements 20, 21 . Operating positions of flow control elements of the valve arrangements 20, 21 are applied through respective couplings to a differential arrangement 35 which operates, if these positions differ by an unacceptable amount, to apply an error indication through respective couplings 35, 36 to prevent the supply pressures P1, P2 from being applied to the respective actuators 10A, 10B .
