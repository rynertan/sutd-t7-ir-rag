# CARBONYLATION PROCESSES USING AMINES OR AMMONIA

## Abstract
a process for the preparation of amides or nitriles is provided. The process comprises carbonylating a nitrogen containing compound of formula R¹R²NH, C₁ to C₂₀ alkyl groups and C₁ to C₂₀ aryl groups, using a Group VIII noble metal catalyst, a halide containing promoter and an acid. Examples of the Group VIII noble metals which can be used as catalysts are rhodium and iridium.
