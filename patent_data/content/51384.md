## Description
ACCELERATED INHIBITED PLATINUM CATALYZED ORGANOSILICOS COMPOSITIONS Background of the Invention The present invention relates to improved organopolysiloxane compositions which are reactive by way of a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction.More specifically, the present invention relates to said compositions having a slow hydrosilylation reaction rate at room temperature and a fast hydrosilylation reaction rate at moderately elevated temperature. In a preferred embodiment this invention relates to organopolysiloxane coating compositions which are curable by way of a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction that provides a long room temperature gel time and a short cure time at elevated temperature and to a method of coating a substrate therewith. Hydrosilylation is a well known and useful reaction in the organosilicon art. It is useful for synthesizing organosilanes and organosiloxanes and for curiny organosiloxane compositions, such as coating, sealing, encapsulating or moldiny compositions. Briefly, hydrosilylation comprises an addition reaction between a silicon bonded hydrogen radical and an olefinic linkage according to the following simplified reaction.EMI2.1 Tne rate of this hydrosilylation reaction is typically increased by the incorporation of a catalyst, such as a platinum type catalyst in the reaction mixture. However, for many applications involving liquid organosiloxane compositions which cure to a coherent solid form, the use of a platinum containing catalyst provides an excessive rate of hydrosilylation at room temperature so that the curable composition thickens, gels, or even cures, to an unusable form before it can be completely configured i.e. positioned and or shaped during its intended use. Several methods have been developed for controlling the rate of a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction however, the preferred method comprises moderating the activity of the hydrosilylation catalyst by adding a catalyst inhibitor, such as certain acetylenic compounds U.S.Patent No. 3,445,420 issued May 20, 1969, toKookootsedes and Plueddemann , benzotriazole U.S.Patent No. 3,192,181 issued June 29, 1965, to Moore or certain halohydrocarbons U.S. Patent No. 3,383,356 issued May 14, 1968, to Nielsen , to the curable composition at some time before all components necessary for the reaction are brought together. This method of hydrosilylation control, although being very effective, is not completely satisfactory because it is necessary to heat the inhibited composition to a high temperature, for example 3000F, to achieve a short cure time, for example 30 seconds. Considerably longer cure times are required at lower temperatures. High curing temperatures are undesirable from an energy expenditure viewpoint tHey are frequently not permitted in many processes where the composition to be cured is in close proximity to a temperature sensitive material. Long cure times are undesirable from an economic viewpoint they are frequently not permitted in a fast paced process that uses the curable composition. High curing temperatures and long cure times are particularly undesirable in the p2per cdating art wherein a curable coating composition is prepared, is coated onto paper over a period of time and then is cured. During this process the curable organosiloxane coating composition must have a long pot life, i.e. it must not gel, or even thicken appreciably, before it has been applied to the paper. It is therefore inhibited, as noted above. The nature of the substrate precludes high curing temperatures. The nature of the process, which frequently is a fast, continuous process comprising further processing steps after the coating composition is cured, such as rolling, stacking or further coating steps, precludes long cure times. Currently, a compromise process involving moderate curing temperatures and moderate cure times is used. An organosiloxane coating composition is needed which has a long gel time at room temperature and a short cure time at slightly elevated temperature, for example 1800F. Such a composition could be prepared and then used over a period of time at room temperature without thickening and yet would rapidly cure when heated.The coatings industry, particularly the paper coatings industry, would benefit greatly from such a composition. Other arts, such as the encapsulating art and the silicone fabricating art, would also be aided. Summary of the Invention It is an object of this invention to provide organosiloxane compositions which react by way of a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction which is inhibited at room temperature but not at moderately elevated temperature. It is a particular object of this invention to provide substantially solventless, heat curable organopolysiloxane coating compositions which have a long room temperature gel time and a short cure time when they are applied to a substrate and heated at 1800F. These objects, and others which will become apparent upon considering the following disclosure and appended claims, are met by the present invention which comprises mixing an organopolysiloxane composition bearing at least two olefinically unsaturated radicals, an organohydrogenpolysiloxane composition bearing at least two silicon bonded hydrogen radicals, a catalytic amount of a platinum containing hydrosilylation catalyst, an effective amount of a platinum catalyst inhibitor and an effective amount of a halohydrocarbon accelerator. It was completely unexpected that certain halohydrocarbons, while having substantially no effect on the rate of an uninhibited hydrosilylation reaction, would substantially increase the rate of an inhibited hydrosilylation reaction at elevated temperature without substantially increasing the rate of the inhibited hydrosilylation reaction at room temperature. Detailed Description of the Invention Broadly stated, the compositions of this invention are improved organopolysiloxane compositions which are reactive by way of a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction of silicon bonded aliphatically unsaturated radicals with silicon bonded hydroyen radicals, the improvement comprising mixing therewith an inhibitor component to decrease the rate of the hydrosilylation reaction at room temperature and an accelerator component to increase the rate of the inhibited hydrosilylation reaction at elevated temperature. Specifically, the present invention relates to the preparation of a reactive composition by mixing components comprising a an organopolysiloxane component having from 1 to 3 organic radicals per silicon atom, the organic radicals of which are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon radicals and substituted hydrocarbon radicals, an average of at least two of said organic radicals per molecule of said organopolysiloxane bearing aliphatic unsaturation which is reactive in a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction, b an oryanohydrogenpolysiloxane component having up to 2 organic radicals per silicon atom, the organic radicals of which are free of aliphatic unsaturation and are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbon radicals and substituted hydrocarbon radicals, there being an average of at least two silicon bonded hydrogen radicals per molecule of said organohydrogenpolysiloxane which are reactive in a platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction, c a platinum containing component in sufficient amount to catalyze a hydrosilyation reaction of said aliphatically unsaturated radicals with said silicon bonded hydrogen radicals, d an inhibitor component in sufficient amount to decrease the rate of the catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction at room temperature, and e an accelerator component in sufficient amount to increase the rate of the inhibited hydrosilylation reaction at 1800F, said accelerator component being selected from the group consisting of saturated halohydrocarbons having an atmospheric boiling point of from 750F to 250 F and to a method comprising configuring said composition into a desired configuration and heating the configured composition to accelerate said hydrosilylation reaction.

A preferred platinum containing catalyst c is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,419,593 issuedDecember 31, 1968, to Dow Corning Corporation, which shows the preparation and use of said catalyst component. A highly preferred catalyst component disclosed by said patent is a reaction product of H2PtCl6.6H20 and CH2 cH CH3 2SiOSi CH3 2 CH CH2 . For convenient handling and use said reaction product is preferably mixed with a low viscositypolydiorganosiloxane fluid bearing an average of at least one aliphatically unsaturated radical per molecule. Component d is an inhibitor component which is effective for reducing the rate of the platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction of the aliphatically unsaturated radicals with the silicon bonded radicals at room temperature, thereby providing an initial period of little or no reaction for the mixture of a plus b plus c plus d .For example, the pot life for a composition which is curable by way of said hydrosilylation reaction is thereby increased. As another example, the induction period of a composition which is polymerizable by way of said hydrosilylation reaction is thereby increased. Inhibitor component d may be any of the well known compounds that are disclosed in the organosilicon art as being useful for temporarily inhibiting the catalytic effect of the platinum containing component c . Some are known to be effective as an inhibitor as long as they remain in the composition, others are known to be effective as an inhibitor only for a limited period of time even though they are still present in the composition. The former compounds can be regarded as true inhibitors while the latter can be regarded as retarders. For the purposes of this invention both types of compound are encompassed by the inhibitor component d . Examples of inhibitor compounds which are suitable for use as component d in the compositions of this invention include the acetylenic compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,445,420 issued May 20, 1969, to Dow Corning Corporation, the sulfoxides disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,453,234 issued July 1, 1969, to Dow Corning Corporation, the silazanes disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,453,233 issued July 1, 1969, to Dow Corning Corporation, the nitriles disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,344,111 issuedSeptember 26, 1967, to General Electric, benzotriazole as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,192,181 issuedJune 29, 1965, to Dow Corning Corporation, and the nitrogen containing compounds disclosed in U.S. PatentNo. 3,188,299 issued June 8, 1965, to GeneralElectric. Compounds which are particularly effective inhibitors especially for coating composition, such as paper coating compositions, which are typically thinly applied to a substrate are l chloro 2 butene, 3 chloro 1 butyne and 3 methyl 3 hydroxy 1 butyne also called methylbutynol and mixtures of two or three of said compounds. Component e is an accelerator component which is effective for increasing the rate of the inhibited platinum catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction of the aliphatically unsaturated radicals with the silicon bonded hydrogen radicals at 1800F., thereby providing for a rapid reaction for the mixture of a plus b plus c plus d plus e at moderately elevated temperatures. For example, the cure time at 1800F for a composition which is curable by way of said inhibited hydrosilylation reaction is thereby decreased. As another example, the polymerization time at 1800F for a composition which is polymerizable by way of said inhibited hydrosilylation reaction is thereby decreased. Accelerator component e can be any saturated halohydrocarbon which has an atmospheric boiling point of from 700F to 2500F however, chlorohydrocarbons are preferred. Chlorohydrocarbons which are particularly effective accelerators, especially for coating compositions, such as paper coating compositions which are typically thinly applied to a substrate, are n propyl chloride, l,l,l trichloroethane and 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane, and mixtures of two or three of said chlorohydrocarbons. The reactive compositions of this invention comprise an organopolysiloxane component a and an organohydroyenpolysiloxane component b taken in sufficient amounts so that the ratio of silicon bonded hydrogen radicals in b to aliphatically unsaturated radicals in a has any value greater than zero, such as 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100 and 1000 however the value of said ratio typically is from 0.1 to 10.0 and should be from 0.9 to 2.1 for curable coating compositions. The amount of platinum containing component c to be used is not critically limited as long as it is sufficient to catalyze the reaction of aliphatically unsaturated radicals with silicon bonded hydroyen radicals. As little as 1 part by weight of platinum is effective however, for curable coating compositions the amount of platinum containing component c to be used should be sufficient to provide from 50 to 250 parts by weight of platinum, all quantities taken with reference to one million parts by weight of organopolysiloxane component a r The amount of inhibitor component d to be used is not critically limited but will depend upon the particular inhibitor that is used. Typically inhibitor component d is present in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 parts by weight for every 100 parts by weight of component a . The amount of accelerator component e to be used is not critically limited but will depend upon the particular accelerator and inhibitor that are used. Typically accelerator component e is present in an amount ranging from 1 to 10 parts by weight for every 100 parts by weight of component a . A highly preferred composition of this invention comprises froln 2 to 6 parts by weight of the accelerator 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane and either 0.02 to 0.1 parts by weight of the inhibitor 3 methyl 3 hydroxy 1 butyne or from 0.1 to 0.2 parts by weight of the inhibitor l chloro 2 butene for every 10 parts by weight of organopolysiloxane component a . The compositions of this invention can contain other components which are commonly used in curable organosilicon compositions provided they do not negate the slow room temperature gelling and the fast heat curing behavior of said composition.Examples of said other components include reinforcing and extending fillers, pigments, diluents, biocides, thickeners, flow control additives and adhesive release additives. The compositions of this invention are obtained whenever components a , b , c , d and e are mixed together in the indicated amounts. The order of mixing is not critical, however, it is preferred that the platinum containing component c be mixed with the organohydrogenpolysiloxane component b and inhibitor component d in a final mixing step. Conveniently, the curable coating compositions of this invention are prepared by mixing two premixed packages, a first package comprising a portion of component a , all of component c and all of component e and a second package comprising the balance of component a , all of component b and all of component d . Alternatively, component d can be placed in the first package instead of the second package. Other alternative combinations are obvious and can be equally useful. The reactive compositions of this invention have various reactivities and range from compositions which react to achieve an increase in molecular weight of components a and b , i.e. polymerization, to compositions which react to achieve a formation of a three dimensional, highly crosslinked reaction product of components a and b , i.e. curing. The extent of curing will vary directly with the number of aliphatically unsaturated radicals per molecule of a plus the number of silicon bonded hydrogen radicals per molecule of b . The curable compositions of this invention have many uses, such as insulating, encapsulating and coating. The present invention thus relates to a process comprising preparing the reactive compositions of this invention, configuring said reactive composition before it reacts completely and heating the configured composition to accelerate the reaction thereof. By configuring it is meant any of positioning, coating, shaping, filling, extruding, impregnating, flowing, spraying and the like. Heating can be accomplished by any means such as by radiant heating, hot air heating, contact heating and steam heating. The present invention relates particularly to a method for coating a substrate, said method comprising preparing a curable composition of this invention, applying said curable composition to said substrate and heating to cure the applied curable composition. The substrate to be coated can be any substrate that does not poison, i.e. prevent, the curing reaction. Examples of said substrate include metal substrates, such as aluminum, titanium, copper, steel, silver, tin and their alloys cellulose substrates such as paper, cardboard and wood siliceous substrates, such as concrete, plaster, porcelain, glass, mortar and ceramics and synthetic polymeric substrates such a polyolefins, polycarbonates, polyacylates, polystyrenes and their copolymers. With respect to the paper coating art the method of this invention advantageously comprises preparing a quantity, such as a two hour quantity, of a curable coating composition of this invention, preferably at a temperature of from 40 to 7O0F., applying the coating composition to a paper substrate, such as kraft paper, clay coated paper or polyethylene coated paper, in a continuous process over a period of time, using a blade coater, and heating the paper as it is coated to at least lBO0F. for a sufficient period of time to cure the applied composition. Advantageously, the curable coating composition to be coated remains usable over the entire production run time period and yet cures rapidly, for example within 60 seconds, when applied to the paper and heated. The paper containing the cured coating can then be immediately or eventually further processed, as desired, such as stored, coated with an adhesive, cut, rolled or formed. The following examples are disclosed to further illustrate, but not limit, the present invention. All amounts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Herein, Me denotes the methyl radical and Vi denotes the vinyl radical. Cure time of a curable paper coatin composition was measured by applying the composition to a 8 1 2 x 11 piece of kraft paper using a Time Lifes blade coater at a blade pressure of 34 pounds per square inch to provide a coated paper having approximately 0.5 pound of coating per ream 0.8 gum2 of paper and immediately placing the coated paper in a 180 F 820C forced air oven for a known period of time, e.g. 30 seconds. The coated and heated paper was then removed from the oven and the coating was examined for smear, rub off and migration as described below.This coating and heating process was repeated, as many times as was needed, utilizing a 5 second shorter or longer heating period than the previous test, until the cure time, i.e. the minimum time that was needed to provide a coating on the paper that displayed no smear, no rub off and no migration, was determined. Smear of a paper coating was measured by lightly rubbing the applied and heated coating with a finger and looking for hazing of the coating no hazing means no smear. Rub off of a paper coating was measured by viyorously rubbing the applied and heated coating with a finger, trying to remove the coating from the paper no removal means no rub off. Migration of a paper coating was measured by placing a test strip of No. 5910 3MR brand transparent tape on the applied and heated coating, adhesive bearing surface in contact with the coating, and rubbing the strip 5 to 10 times with a finger to adhere it to the coating. The strip of transparent tape was then removed from the coating and its adhesive beariny surface was double onto itself and pressed firmly together. The force needed to separate the doubled test strip was then compared to the force needed to separate a doubled strip of fresh tape and rated as no less than, slightly less than, moderately less than or grossly less than, and the migration of the coating was correspondingly rated, i.e. no , slight , moderate or gross migration. Gel time, i.e. pot life, of a curable paper coating composition, at any particular temperature, was determined by measuring the time that was needed for the viscosity of the composition to become twice as viscous as the viscosity of the composition immediately after being mixed at said temperature. A Brookfields viscometer, Model RVF, fitted with a No. 8 spindle was used to measure viscosity. Adhesive release of a paper coating composition was measured by coating kraft paper, as noted above for cure time determinations, heating the coated paper at 180 F for 50 seconds to cure the coating and proceeding as follows. The cured coating was aged at 700F for 24 hours and then coated with adhesive using a solution of Monsanto GMS 263 acrylic adhesive applied to the cured coating at a wet thickness of 3 mils 76.2 pm using a Bird Bar. The applied adhesive was air dried at room temperature for 1 minute, heated at 650C. for 1 minute and then cooled to room temperature again for 1 minute. A sheet of 60 pound Matte Litho was applied to the l mil thick dried adhesive and the resulting laminate was pressed through two rolls of an off set printer and aged for 20 hours at 70 C. Release testing of the laminates was accomplished by cooling the aged laminates to room temperature for 4 hours, cutting the cooled laminates into 25.4 mm wide strips, and pulling theMatte adhesive lamina from the Kraft paper coatiny lamina at an angle of 180 w radians at 400 inches minutes 0.17 m s . The force, in grams per inch, that was required to separate the laminae was noted and was converted to newtons per meter N m for this disclosure by multiplying by 0.3860886 and rounding off.Examples 1 to 13 In these examples and controls a curable oryanopolysiloxane paper coating composition having the followiny formulation was used. a 100 parts ViMe2SiO Me2SiO 41 MeViSiO o,gSiMe2Vi b 2.0 parts Me3Sio MeHSiO 50SiMe3 b 2.8 parts Me3SiO Me2SiO 3 MeHSiO sSiMe3 c 2.4 parts hydrosilylation catalyst.The hydrosilylation catalyst was prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,419,593 and contained 0.6 percent platinum in the form of H2PtClb.6H20 reacted with ViMe2Si 20 and dissolved in ViMe2SiO Me2SiO 150 SiMe2Vi. The above curable composition contained 144 parts Pt, per one million parts of component a , and 1.3 silicon bonded hydrogen radicals for every silicon bonded vinyl radical. The vinyl radical contribution of component c is negligible and was neglected. The compositions listed in Table I, either controls, which were free of intentionally added inhibitor and accelerator or comprising only intentionally added inhibitor or accelerator and examples of this invention, which comprised intentionally added inhibitor and accelerator, were prepared by 1 mixing the indicated inhibitor and indicated amount with the 4.8 parts of premixed hydrogen radical containing polymers, 2 mixing the indicated accelerator and indicated amount and the 2.4 parts of platinum containing catalyst with the 100 parts of vinyl radical containing polymer, 3 adjusting the temperatures of the two resulting mixtures to 250C. and then 4 mixing the two mixtures. Cure time at 180 F and gel time at room temperature were measured immediately for each composition, as described above. Note that the compositions of this invention have the desirable combination of long gel times, similar to those of the inhibited controls, and short 180 F cure times, similar to that of the uninhibited control. The adhesive release of the compositions of Examples 4 to 7 was 58 N m. Examples 14 to 21 These examples, summarized in Table II, illustrate the added usefulness of the present invention that is available by preparing and maintaininy the paper coating compositions of this invention at 5 C. before applying them to paper. In Examples 14 to 19 the curable paper coating compositions were prepared as described in Examples 1 to 13, except that the final mixing temperature was either 50C or 25 C. In Examples 20 and 21 the curable paper coatiny compositions were prepared as described in Examples 1 to 13 except 1.6 parts, instead of 2.4 parts, of the hydrosilylation catalyst was used.Additionally, the inhibitor and the accelerator were mixed and the resulting mixture was mixed with the vinyl radical containing copolymer before the hydrog en radical containing polymers were mixed therewith, at either 50C or 250C. Note that the compositions of this invention possess and retain shorter 1800F cure times when they are prepared and maintained at 50C instead of 25 C. The composition of Examples 14 to 20 had a room temperature gel time of 120 minutes. The composition of Example 21 had a room temperature gel time of 90 minutes. Example 22 A curable organopolysiloxane paper coating composition was used in this example that was similar to that described in Examples 1 to 13, varying therefrom only in that 4.0 parts of the hydroyen radical containing polymer having the average formula Me3SiO MeHSiO 50S1Me3 was used as the only source of silicon bonded hydrogen radicals. Such a composition had a room temperature gel time of 2 minutes and a 180 CF cure time of less than 45 seconds immediately after being prepared. When 0.2 parts of the inhibitor ClCH2CH CHCH3 was incorporated into this curable composition by mixiny it with the hydroyen radical containing polymer, the room temperature gel time of the composition was desirably increased to 120 minutes.However, the 1800F cure time was increased to 300 seconds, a cure time undesirably long for paper coating processes. When 0.2 parts of the inhibitor ClCH2CH CHCH3 and 3.0 parts of the accelerator CH3CH2CH2C1 were incorporated into the curable composition, by mixing the fonDer with the hydrogen radical containing polymer and the latter with the mixture of platinum containing component and vinyl radical containing component a , the resulting composition of this invention had a room temperature gel time of 60 minutes and a 180 F cure time of 65 seconds immediately after being prepared a very useful composition for paper coating processes.Examples 23 to 25 A cure modifying composition was prepared by thoroughly mixing 5000 parts of the accelerator CCl3CH2CH2Cl and 58 parts of the inhibitor CH3 2C OH C CH. This mixture was incorporated, at 25 C., in various concentrations into the curable paper coating composition described in Examples 1 to 13, by mixing it with the vinyl radical containing component a before the premixed hydrogen radical containing components b were mixed therewith. The room temperature gel time of the resulting control composition and three compositions of this invention ranged from 1 minute control to 20 minutes to 120 minutes to 150 minutes as the amount of cure modifying composition was varied from 0 control to 2 to 4 to 5 parts, respectively.In each of the four compositions the 1800F cure time was found to be 30 seconds when measured immediately after the compositions were prepared.Example 26 When Example 18 was repeated, with the exception that 1 part of the accelerator CH3CH2CH2Br was used instead of 3 parts of CH3CH2C i2C1, and the inhibitor ClCH2CH CHC3 was mixed with the vinyl radical containing copolymer instead of the hydrogen radical containing polymers, a composition having a 180 F cure time of 60 seconds and a room temperature gel time of 90 minutes was obtained.Omission of the accelerator CH3CH2CH2Br from the composition of this example provided a composition having a 180 F cure time exceeding 300 seconds and a room temperature gel time of 120 minutes.Examples 27 to 34 In these examples and controls the curable paper coating composition was the same as that described in Examples 1 to 13 except that the amount of platinum containing component was varied from 4.0 to 0.8 parts as noted in Table III. The compositions of this invention contained 0.16 parts ofClCH2CH CHCH3 as an inhibitor and 3.0 parts ofC13CH2CH2C1 as an accelerator. The controls were free of intentionally added inhibitor and accelerator, except as noted for controls xv. and xvi. Note that this invention is effective for compositions having a wide range of platinum catalyst concentration. The adhesive release of these coating compositions ranged from 58 to 77 N m. Examples 35 and 36 When Example 14 was twice repeated, except 0.16 and 0.12 parts, respectively, of the inhibitor ClCH2CH CHCHj were used instead of 0.20 parts, the resulting compositions of this invention had 180 F cure times of 30 seconds and 25 seconds, respectively, and room temperature gel times of 60 minutes and 15 minutes, respectively.Examples 37 to 40 These examples show the preparation of the compositions of this invention in a solvent. The compositions were prepared as described in examples 20 and 21 except that the prefix of accelerator and inhibitor, detailed in Table IV, was mixed with the hydrogen radical containing polymers instead of the vinyl radical containing polymer. To measure cure rate the heptane containing coating compositions were coated onto paper with a No. 12 Mayer rod instead of the above described Time LifeR Blade Coater. Note that the presence of a solvent does not effect the 10 F cure time of the composition of this invention. Examples 41 to 44 A cure modifying composition was prepared by mixing 5000 parts of CH3CH2CH2C1 and 58 parts of CH3 2C OH CiCH. This mixture was mixed, at 250C., in various concentrations with the curable paper coating composition described in Examples 21 and 22 except that the cure modifying composition was mixed with either the vinyl radical containing component a or the mixture of hydrogen radical containing components b as noted in Table V. Example 45 A curable composition was prepared by mixing 100 parts of the organopolysiloxane component a and 1.6 parts of the platinum containing component described in Examples 1 to 13, 0.2 parts of l chloro 2 butene and 9.8 parts of an organohydrogenpolysiloxane component consisting essentially of CH3 3Si0l 2 siloxane units, CH3 H SiO2 2 siloxane units and Si04 2 siloxane units. The resulting mixture had approximately 0.8 silicon bonded hydrogen radicals for every silicon bonded vinyl radical, a room temperature pot life of more than 480 minutes and a 1800F cure time of 150 seconds.When 3 parts of 1,1,1,3 tetrachloropropane was mixed with the curable composition the 180 cm cure time was decreased to 55 seconds and the room temperature pot life still exceeded 480 minutes.
