# Polysubstituted butanoic acids, esters and derivatives thereof useful as herbicides, Compositions containing them and their use.

## Abstract
The invention relates to polysubstituted butanoic acids, esters and derivatives thereof which have been found to be useful as herbicides in the control of undesirable mono and di cotyledonous plants. The active compounds have the formula CHEM wherein R1 is OH, OR4, NR5R6 or OM R2 and R3 each represent a member selected from the group consisting CHEM pyridyl and thienyl R4 is alkyl C1 C8, monohaloalkyl C1 C4, monohaloalkynyl C3 C4, monohaloalkenyl C3 C4, alkoxy C1 C4 alkyl C1 C4 or hydroxyalkynyl C2 C4 R5 and R6 each independently represent members selected from the group consisting of H and alkyl C1 C2 M is an alkali metal, ammonium, C1 C8 mono or di alkylammonium or hydroxyethylammonium and X and Y each independently represent members selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, alkyl C1 C4 alkoxy C1 C4, OCF3, OCHF2, CF3, CN, COOH, NO2, OH, SCH3, NR7R8, CH3SO2, and when X and Y are taken together they may represent OCH2O jointed to adjacent positions of the benzene ring and R7 and R8 are each hydrogen or alkyl C1 C2 . Compounds of formula I exist in threo and erythro stereoisomeric forms, and in general the threo isomers many of which are novel compounds are the more active herbicidal agents. Accordingly it is generally preferred to employ the threo stereoisomers and threo erythro mixtures.
