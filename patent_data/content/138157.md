# Static leonard apparatus.

## Abstract
In a static leonard apparatus, a DC motor 4 is supplied from a thyristor converter 2 through a main circuit switch 3 , and a capacitor 7 is connected between the DC output buses ot the thyristor converter. When the main circuit switch is turned off, a grounding switch 12 is turned on to ground one of the DC output buses to form a grounded closed discharge circuit including the DC motor through which the capacitor dis charges. During the turned off period of the main circuit switch, the capacitor is charged with the output voltage of the thyristor converter. The capacitor discharges through the grounded closed discharge circuit. The voltage values of the discharging capacitor at two points on the time axis are de tected to compute the discharge time constant of the capaci tor, and, on the basis of the computed discharge time con stant, the insulation resistance of the DC motor is measured.
