# A probe assembly for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A probe assembly 10 for injection of microwave energy into the cylinder cavity of a diesel engine 19 and detection of luminescence indicative of fuel ignition in the cylinder. The probe assembly 10 comprises a probe 12 with microwave and optical transmitters 30, 28 extending axially therethrough adapted to be threaded into a cylinder opening. A coupler 14 is removably mounted on the probe 12 and includes an optical detector 58 mounted in assembly coaxially with the optical transmitters 28 in the probe and a microwave antenna 68 coupled by a waveguide cavity 52 within the coupler to the probe microwave transmitter 20 . The coupler 14 is adapted for connection to suitable external diagnostic cIrcuitry 15 for providing to such circuitry signals indicative of piston position within the cylinder and fuel ignition as a function of the microwave and luminescence signals respectively.
