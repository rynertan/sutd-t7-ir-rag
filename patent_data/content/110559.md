# Process for the preparation of 4 chloro 2 nitrobenzonitrile.

## Abstract
4 chloro 2 nitrobenzonitrile is prepared by reacting 1 mol of 2,5 dichloronitrobenzene with 1.0 to 1.5 mols of cupper I cyanide, preferably in an inert solvent, for 2 to 6 hours at 140 to 170 C. An inorganic cyanide may also be present. Yields of 43 to 73 are demonstrated.
