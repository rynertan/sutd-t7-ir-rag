## Abstract
A central station alarm reporting system has a central station 7 connected to a plurality of remote premises units 9 via a telephone network 8. In central station 7, a micro processor 10 controls a plurality of selector control unit interfaces 11 each of these sends information by frequency shift keying FSK . Each remote station includes a channel service unit 16, which receives such FSK information. The SCU 16 also encodes 4 bit words to be sent back to dual tone multifrequency DTMF transmission, as a high tone having 1 of 4 predetermined high frequencies and a low tone having 1 of 4 predetermined low frequencies. Thus each 4 bit word is sent with all 4 bits passing simulta neously. Each SCU 16 includes a decoder for decoding the DTMF transmissions back into 4 bit words.
