# LIQUID PHASE CLAUS REACTION

## Abstract
The rate of sulfur formation is favored in reactions bet ween a sulfur dioxide rich absorbent and hydrogen sulfide if such a reaction is carried out at superatmospheric pressure while at a temperature no less than about the melting point of sulfur so as to increase the rate of destruction of undesired thiosulfate.
