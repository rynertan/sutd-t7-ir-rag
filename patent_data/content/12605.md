# Shaped products of polypropylene.

## Abstract
A shaped product made of polypropylene, whereof 2.0 to 90 by weight is soluble and 91 to 98 is insoluble in boiling heptane, and of the insoluble portion at least 0.955 as mea sured by ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrography, wherein the area of a mmmm peak is measured as a fraction of the total area of the absorption peaks in the methyl carbon region of the polymer is of isotactic pentad structure. This product has high film stiffness and resistance to electrically insulating oils and to heat. The product can be a stretched film or insulating material for electrical equipment.
