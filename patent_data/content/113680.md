# Daylight film loading method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A film package containing a stack of notched films in a lighttight envelope is held vertically in a lighttight loading chamber by a clamp member engaging with the notches of the films. The lower end of the envelope is cut, and the envelope is moved vertically relative to the films until the films are projected from the lower end of the envelope while the films are clamped by the clamp member. The clamp member is then disengaged from the notches of the films, and the films are allowed to move down into a receiving chamber positioned under the loading chamber. Then, a shutter is closed between the receiving chamber and the loading chamber to shield the films in the receiving chamber from light.
