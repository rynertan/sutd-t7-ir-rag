# Improvements relating to opening roller assemblies for open end spinning machines.

## Abstract
An opening roller assembly for open end spinning machines wherein the roller is releasably and slidably supported on a drive shaft of the open end spinning machine to enable easy removal of the roller for refurbishing, replacement or repair. Non mechanical means is provided to maintain the roller in an operative position on the drive shaft. Such means may comprise magnetic or fluid pressure means, or gravity. When in its operative position on the shaft, mechanical drive means extending directly or indirect ly between the drive shaft and the roller will automatically become engaged.
