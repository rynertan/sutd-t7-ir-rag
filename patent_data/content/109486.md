# Recovery of components of a binary azeotrope.

## Abstract
Methanol and cyclohexane are recovered from a con densed methanol cyclohexane azeotrope by allowing the condensed azeotrope to separate in a vessel into an upper phase rich in cyclohexane and a lower phase rich in methanol, fractionating the upper phase in a first column whereby the methanol cyclohexane azeotrope is taken off the top and returned to the vessel while cyclohexane is removed from the lower portion of the first column, and fractionating the lower phase in a second column whereby the methanol cyclohexane azeotrope is taken off the top and returned to the vessel while methanol is removed from the lower portion of the second column.
