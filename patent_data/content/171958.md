# Electro and magneto optic devices.

## Abstract
Electro and magneto optic device comprises a fluid suspension of anisotropic platelets in a dielectric media 14 , and a means 16 for imposing an electrical or magnetic field on the suspension. Orientation of such platelets in the media is accomplished by imposition of an electrical or magnetic field. The invention may be used to provide an information display or a field controlled shutter in window glass.
