The compounds of formula II wherein R1 is hydrogen or salt thereof can be synthesized according to Schemes A C. As shown in Scheme A, a compound of formula II can be prepared in accordance with the procedure of Yoshida et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 29, 2899 2909 1981 , from the known dibromo penam of formula IV. The dibromo penam V undergoes an exchange reaction with t butyl magnesium chloride at a temperature of between about 90 and 400C, preferably about 76 C in a reaction inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or toluene, preferably tetrahydrofuran. Other organometallic reagents may also be employed. The resultant reaction mixture is treated in situ with the appropriate aldehyde e.g., acetaldehyde for the 1 hydroxyethyl derivative. The aldehyde is added at between about 80 and 600C, preferably about 76 C for acetaldehyde. The resulting bromo.hydroxy penam V is hydrogenated to remove the 6 bromo substituent. A suitable hydrogenation catalyst is a noble metal catalyst such as palladium. The reaction is carried out in a protic solvent such as 1 1 methanol water or 1 1 tetrahydro SCHEME AEMI9.1 SCHEME BEMI10.1 SCHEME CEMI11.1 furan water, preferably 1 1 methanol water, at a pressure of about 1 to 4 atms, preferably 4 atm and a temperature of between about 0 and 300C, preferably about 25 C.

Thus, dimethyl t butylchlorosilane in the presence of an gamine proton acceptor such as imidazole in a polar, aprotic solvent such as N,N dimethylformamide at a temperature range of between about 5 and 40 C, preferably about 250C forms a trialkylsilyl hydroxylprotecting group as shotm in formula VII. Treatment of VII with mercuric acetate in acetic acid at a temperature of about 900C yields the olefin VIII. In order to obtain the desired azetidinone IX, the ole in VIII is ozoni ed in a reaction inert solvent such as dichloromethane at a temperature of between about 80 and 40, preferably about 760C. The reaction product is treated with an alkanol such as methanol to yield the azetidine IX As shown in Scheme B, a compound of formula TX is treated with trithiocarbonate salt of the formula M R10 S C S S wherein R10 is alkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms, preferrably ethyl, and M is a metal such as sod or potassium to obtain a compound of formula X. This conversion of IX to X is carried out in an organic solvent or water, preferably a mixture of water and dichloromethane at a temperature range of about 0 350C, preferably about 25 C. The compound of formula X is condensed with p nitrobenzyl chloro oxalate in the presence of a tertiary alkylamine wherein each alkyl has, for example, 1 4 carbon atoms such ethyl di isopropylamine, to obtain the compound of formula XI. This condensation reaction is carried out in a reaction inert solvent, preferably dichloromethane, at a temperature range of about 5 25 CC, preferably about 1O0C. The resulting compound of formula XI is cyclized using z trialkyl phosphine wherein alkyl has 1 4 carbon atoms such as triethylphosphite in a reaction inert solvent such as trichloromethane at a temperature range of about 40 80 C, preferably about 60 C to obtain the penen o formula XII. The thiol group of compound XII is oxidized to the corresponding sulfoxide XIII with an oxidizing agent such as m chloroperbenzoic acid in a reaction inert solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature range of about 10 to 300C, preferably 200C. The sulfoxide XIII is substituted with the mercaptide of formula R S by employing, for example, the sodium or potassium salt which is reacted with the sulfoxide XIII in an polar organic solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile at a temperature range of about 35 to 500C, preferably about 350C. Starting mercaptans of the formula R SH or starting thioacetates of the formula R S C O CH3 are known for many of the values of R and those which are not known can be prepared bit analogous methods known in the art. For a review see J.L. Wardell, Preparation of Thicls, in The Chenistrv of the Thiol Grou, S. Patai, editor, John Wiley Sons, London, 1974, Chapter 4. See also Volante, Tetrahedron Letters, 22, 3119 3122 1981 for the conversion of alcohols to thiols and thiolesters using triphenylphosphine and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate in the presence of the alcohol and an appropriate thiolacid. Where R groups contain an S O n group and n is I or 2, the corresponding sulfide n is zero thioacetate R S C O CH3 can be oxidized with an approximately equimolar amount of m chloroperbenzoic acid to the sulfoxide n is one or with additional m chloroperbenzoic acid to obtain the sulfone n is two without oxidation of the thioacetate sul fur. The sulfoxide can also be oxidized to the sulfone with potassium permanganate in an aqueous solvent such as aqueous acetone at a buffered pF of about 7 at about 20 5O0C, preferably about 25 C. This method is particularly preferred for an R group containing 2 hydroxyl group Furthermore, cyclic sulfone containing double bonds can be readily isomerized bv the procedures of Prochazka et al., Collection Czech. Chem. Conn., 31,3744 1966 . For compounds of formula XIV the trialkylsilyl group is preferably removed prior to the hydrogenolysis to remove the acid protecting group PNB to obtain a compound of formula XV. the trialkylsilyl group is removed with a tetralkylammonium fluoride in a ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature range of about 15 to 400C, preferably about 25 C. Conversion of a compound of formula XV to z compound of formula II is accornplished using a conventional hydrogenolysis reaction, and it is carried out in conventional fashion fdr this type of transformation. Thus, A soluticn of a compound of the formula XV is stirred or sheen under an atmosphere of hydrogen, or hydrogen mixed with an inert diluent such as nitrogen or argon, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a noble metal hydrogenolysis catalyst, such as a palladium on calcium carbonate or a palladium on Celite a diatomaceous earth catalyst.Convenient solvents for this hydrogenolysis are lower alkanols, such as methanol ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxan low molecular weight esters, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate water and mixtures of these solvents. However, it is usual to choose conditions under which the starting material is soluble. The hydrogenclysis is usually carried out at room temperature and at a pressure from about 0.5 to about 5 kg cmê. The catalyst is usually present in an amount from about 10 percent by weight based on the starting material up to an amount equal in weight to the starting material, although larger amounts can be used.The reaction commonly takes about one hour after which the compound of the formulaI is recovered simply bv filtration followed by removal of the solvent in vacuo. If palladium on calcium carbonate is used as the catalyst, the product is often isolated as the calcium salt and if palladiumon Celite is employed the product is often isolated as the sodium salt. The compound of formulas I or II can be purified by conventional methods for beta lactam compounds. For example, the compound of formulas I or II can be purified by colunn chromatography, gel filtration on Sephadex, or by recrystallization. An alternate synthetic procedure is shown in SchemeC. The azetidine of formula IX is reacted with a trithiocarbonate cf the formula M R S C S S wherein M is a metal such a sodium or potassium using the procedure previously described to prepare X. The resulting tritiocarbonate XVa is treated with P nitrokenzyloxyzarbonyl dihydroxy methane in an aprotic solvent snch as benzene, toluene or dimethyl formamide, preferably benzene, at a temperature range of about 25 1100C, preferably about 800C to yield the alcohol of formula XVI. The corresponding chloride XVII is prepared from the alcohol XVI by treating thionyl chloride in a reaction inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a hindered amine which serves as an acid acceptor such as 2,6 lutidine at a temperature range of about 10 to 750C, preferably OtC. The chloride XVII is reacted with a triarylphosphine such as triphenylphosphine in a reaction inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a tertiary amine such as 2,6 lutidine at a temperature of about 250C, to obtain the compound of formula XVIII which is cyclized by refluxing in an aromatic solvent such as toluene to yield the penem of formula XIV. Trithiocarbonate salts of the formula M R S C S S are prepared from the appropriate mercaptan of the formula R SH or by treatment of a thioacetate of the formula RSC O CH3 with an alkaline metal alkoxide followed by carbon disulfide. By employing the heretofore mentioned procedure ofYoshida et al., the stereochemistry at carbon 6 of the penem as well as the hydroxyethyl group attached to carbon 6 is that shown in formula II. The principal stereochemistry for the product of ring closure using SchemesB or C is that wherein the hydrogen at penem ring position 5 is trans to the hydrogen on carbon 6 and in the alpha configuration. Alternatively, the stereochemistry can be described as 5R, 6S 6 R l hydroxyethyl. The compounds of formula I or II are acidic and will form salts with basic agents. Such salts are considered to be within the scope of this invention. These salts can be prepared by standard techniques, such as contacting the acidic and basic components, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in an aqueous, non aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. They are then recovered by filtration, by precipitation with a nonsolvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or in the case of aqueous solutions by lyophili zation, as appropriate.Basic aqents which are suitably employed in salt formation belong to both the organic and inorganic types, and they include ammonia, organic amines, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, hydrides and alkoxides, as well as alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, hydrides and alkoxides.Representative examp les of such bases are primary gamines, such as n propylamine, n butylamine, aniline cyclohexyl amine, benzylamine and octylamine secondary amines, such as diethylamine, morpholine, pyrrolidine and piperidine tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, N ethylpiperidine, N methylmorpholine and 1, 5 diazabicyclo 4,3,0 non 5 ene hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, acanonium hydroxide and barium hydroxide alkoxides, such as sodium ethoxide and potassium ethoxide hydrides, such as calcium hybrid and sodium hydride carbonates, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate bicarbonates, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate and alkali metal salts of long chain fatty acids, such as sodium 2 ethylhexanoate. Preferred salts of the compounds of formula T orII are sodium, potassium and calcium salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt is one in which the resulting compound of formula I or II is non toxic, useful as a therapeutic agent and has metabolic decompositicn products which are non toxic. As indicated hereinbefore, the compounds of formula I or II and salts thereof are anti bacterial agents.The in vitro activity cf the compounds of the formula T or II and salts thereof can be demonstrated by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC s in mcg ml against a variety of microorganisms., The procedure which is followed is the one recommended by theInternational Collaborative Study on Antibiotic Sensitivity Testing Ericsson and Sherris, Acta. Patholoqica et Mi robiologia Scandinav, Supp. 217,Section B 64 68 1971 , and employs brain heart infusion BHI agar and the inocula replicating device.Overnight growth tubes are diluted 100 fold for use as the standard inoculum 20,000 10,000 cells in approxmately 0.002 ml. are placed on the agar surface 20 ml. cf BRI agar dish . Twelve 2 fold dilutions of the test compound are employed, with initial concentration of the test drug being 200 mcg ml. Single colonies are dis regarded when reading plates after 18 hys. at 37 C.The susceptibility MIC of the test organism is accepted as the lowest concentration of compound capable of producing complete inhibition of growth as judgedby the naked eye. The compounds of formula a I or II, and the pharmaceu tically acceptable salts thereo, are suitable for the control of bacterial infections in mammmals, including man.They will find use in the control of infections caused by susceptible bacteria in human subjects, e.g. infec tions caused by susceptible strains of Staph lococces aureus. When a compound of formula I or II, or a pharmaceu tically acceptable salt thereof, is used to treat a bacterial infection in a mammalian subject, it can be administered orally or parenterally, i.e. intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally or intravenously. The compound can be administered alone, or it can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The proportional ratio of active ingredient to carrier will naturally depend on the chemical nature, solubility and stability of the active ingredient, as well as the dosage contemplated.however, in a pharmaceutical con position containing an antibacterial agent of the invention., the ratio of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to the penem ccmpound will normally be in the range from 1 10 to 4 1. For the oral mode of administration, an antibacterial penem compound of this invention can be used in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, powders, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions and suspensions, and the like. In the case of tablets, carriers which can be used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets.For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. t 1en aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents can be added. For parenteral administration, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pF of the solutions are suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. As indicated earlier, the compounds of formula I or II are of se as antibacterial agents in human subjects against susceptible organisms. The prescribing physician will ultimately determine the appropriate dose for a given human subjcct, and this can bc expected to vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the nature and the severity of the patients symptoms.The compounds of formula I or 1I will normally be used orally at dosages in the range from about 10 to about 200 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day, and parenterally at dosages from about 10 to about 400 mg. per kilogram of body weight per day.These figures are illustrative only, however, and in some cases it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits.
