# Method of and apparatus for movement portrayal with a raster, e.g. television, display.

## Abstract
To portray movement in a television display, a field of the signal is stored in an image store 110 , and subsequent input fields are compared in a motion detector 104 with the sorted field to detect differences between them due to movement. A flag is retained in an auxiliary store 114 to indicate the posi tons in the field of the detected differences. For those posi tions for which a new difference is detected, i.e. for which no difference has been detected previously, the corresponding portions of the then current input scan are stored in the image store 110 , by a switch 106 being connected to the input 102 . For portions which are flagged, the output of the auxi liary store 114 causes the switch 106 to take the output of the image store 110 , thus insetting past positions of move ment into the current field. The background of the field in the image store is nevertheless updated by the background of the input field. To allow for the 4 field NTSC or 8 field PAL cycle, transducers, or predictors, 170, 160 are placed at the input and output of the image store 110 such that the image store retains information in one state only of the cycle. The motion detector 104 comprises a subtractor, a rectifier and a low pass filter.
