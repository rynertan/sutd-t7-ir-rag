# HOT WATER HEATER AND STEAM GENERATOR

## Abstract
In a water tube boiler comprising a housing enclosing tubes bent to form vertical chambers successively travers ed by rising hot combustion gases, the tubes being connect ed at the bottom to the interior of the jacket of a jacketed cy lindrical combustion chamber, which jacket is supplied with cold water, and at the top to a steam manifold, the manifold and jacketed chamber project beyond the housing with a downcomer outside the housing connecting the top of the jacket and the lowest part of the manifold, thereby permit ting the boiler to operate with a shallow level of water in the manifold, speeding up circulation of water and its heating, and permitting substantially dry steam to be discharged from the upper manifold. The chambers may include baffles which are angled so that the hot gas hits them at an angle less than 90 so as to be deflected thereby in the direction of its advance, thereby avoiding hot spots. Advantageously successive chambers from bottom to top are reduced in volume to make up for the reduction in volume as the hot gas cools, thereby keeping the gas velocity high and maintaining turbulence which helps heat exchange. A gas or oil burner is situated so that its flame is within the water cooled jacketed chamber. Alternatively, instead of burning fuel within the cham ber, the chamber can be supplied with waste heat as from a turbine exhaust.
