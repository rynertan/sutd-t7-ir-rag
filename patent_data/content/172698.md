# Method for increasing the chemical durability of borosilicate glass tubing and articles made therefrom.

## Abstract
A method of increasing the chemical durability of borosilicate glass tubing and also hollow articles made therefrom by adding about 2 to 3 by volume of a fluorine containing gas, i.e. C₂F₆, to the inflating air used to form the tubing using conventional tube forming methods. The alkalinity of the borosilicate glass tubing surfaces, as well as the surfaces of containers, including ampoules made therefrom, is reduced by as much as 70 by weight or more.
