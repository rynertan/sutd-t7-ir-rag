# Liquid phase epitaxial process.

## Abstract
In a liquid phase epitaxial process for producing mag netic garnet crystals, primary melt residues adhering to a magnetic garnet crystal 4 are removed by immersing the crystal 2, 4 subsequent to growth in a rinse melt at or near the growth temperature of the primary melt. The rinse melt has a saturation to nucleation temperature range overlapping that of the primary melt and encompassing its growth temperature, has a solvent different from that of the primary melt and saturated or super saturated with respect to the primary melt s solute, and has no undesirable adhe sion properties of its own. The rinse melt enables residues of bismuth containing melts to be removed. Bismuth containing primary melts are used to improve the properties of garnet crystal structures 2, 4, 6, 8 used for magneto optic light deflec tors.
