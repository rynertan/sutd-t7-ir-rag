# Color cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A color cathode ray tube having a face glass 1 coated with a plurality of phosphors 6B, 6G, 6R different in luminescent color, the face glass 1 containing a colorant imparting a selective characteristic for absorbing light in the wavelength regions between the luminescent wavelength regions of the phosphors, 6B, 6G, 6R and a colorant suppressing the light transmittance in the visible region, wherein the light transmittances in the luminescent wavelength regions shorter than the highest visibility wavelength region are at least about 5 lower than the light transmittance in the highest visibility region, while the light transmittances in the luminescent wavelength regions lon ger than the highest visibility wavelength region is higher than the light transmittance in the highest visibility region.
