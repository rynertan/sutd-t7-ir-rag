# Modified resistive layer in thermal transfer medium.

## Abstract
A thermal ribbon 7 having a minute coating of graphite powder 11 on the outer side of the resistive layer. The improved electrical interface with print electrodes reduces ribbon and printhead damage. The graphite also reduces friction and loosens material which builds up at the print head.
