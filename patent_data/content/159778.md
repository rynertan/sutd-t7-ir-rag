# REMOTELY CONTROLLED HYDRAULIC CLEANER APPARATUS

## Abstract
A remotely controlled hydraulically operated cleaner appa ratus 10 for use in cleaning the interior of a conduit or pipe 12 comprises a control means 20 located outside of the con duit 12 for generating control signals for controlling the op eration of the cleaner apparatus 10 . A source of pressurized hydraulic fluid 70, 52 is connected to valve means 90 for re ceiving and distributing hydraulic fluid in accordance with con trol signals received from the control means 20 . The apparat us 10 further includes a housing 14 containing a hydraulical ly powered motor 144 adapted to receive hydraulic fluid from the valve means 90 . An adjustable cleaner tool means 22 is provided for cooperating with the motor 144 for rotation rela tive to the conduit 12 , the cleaner tool means 22 being adjustable in order to maintain engagement with the interior walls of the conduit 12 . The housing 14 is supported within the conduit 12 by an adjustable support means 24 and a hydraulically actuated means 134 is provided for receiving hydraulic fluid from the valve means 90 for adjusting the ad justable support means 24 to maintain the housing 14 gen erally radially centered within the conduit 12 . In the presently preferred embodiment, the cleaner tool means 22 and the support means 24 are concurrently adjustable and cooperate to have the same relative outer boundary to engage the conduit 12 .
