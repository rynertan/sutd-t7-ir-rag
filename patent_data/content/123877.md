# Methods for preparing Protein compositions substantially free from infections agents.

## Abstract
Compositions containing therapeutically or immu nologically active proteins are rendered substantially free from infectious agents such as viable viruses and bacteria without substantial loss of therapeutic or immunologic activ ity by mixing the protein composition with a complex formed from source of transition metal ions, such as copper ions, and an angularly fused, polynuclear heterocyclic arene having two nitrogen atoms in a cis ortho relationship, such as phenanthroline, and a reducing agent such as a thiol in amounts and at a temperature and for a time suf ficient to inactivate substantially all of the viruses and bac teria contained therein. Compositions containing therapeu tically active proteins substantially free from viral and bac terial infectivity, which have heretofore been unattainable, can be prepared by the method of the invention.
