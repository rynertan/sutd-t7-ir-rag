# A whitener and a method for preparing same.

## Abstract
A whitener having as major ingredients, on a dry basis, a sweetener, a water dispersible protein, and a lipid system wherein said lipid system is a fluid shortening comprising a hydrogenated, beta forming, predominantly C16 C18 oil having an IV of about 85 100 and a solid fat index at 50 DEG F. of about 10 18 and stably dispersed therein, a stabilizing amount of a fine crystalline, normally solid phase or fatty acid derived food stabilizer component and an emulsifying amount of an oil water emulsifier. The fluid shortening is capable of being metered into the whitener formulation during manufacture, and is capable of use at substantially reduced levels as compared to conventional lipid systems for coffee whiteners.
