# Vinyl chloride polymer composition.

## Abstract
A vinyl chloride polymer composition comprising A 3 to 50 parts by weight of a grafted copolymer and B 97 to 50 parts by weight of a vinyl chloride polymer a total amount of the copolymer A and the polymer B being 100 parts by weight the grafted copolymer A comprising 1 50 to 80 parts by weight of a rubber copolymer and 2 50 to 20 parts by weight of a grafting monomer, a total amount of the component 1 and the component 2 being 100 parts by weight the component 1 comprising a 60 to 90 by weight of the rubber copolymer comprising 99 to 85 by weight of alkyl acrylate having an alkyl group of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, 1 to 15 by weight of conjugated diolefin and 0 to 5 by weight of polyfunctional cross linking agent and b 40 to 10 by weight of a surface rubber copolymer comprising 98 to 70 by weight of alkyl acrylate having an alkyl group of 2 to 8 carbon atoms, 2 to 30 by weight of conjugated diolefin and 0 to 5 by weight of polyfunctional cross linking agent and being obtained by polymerizing the component a to give a core rubber copolymer and then polymerizing the surface rubber copolymer component b in the presence of the core rubber copolymer a , and a ratio of conjugated diolefin to acrylate in the surface rubber copoly mer b is larger than a ratio of conjugated diolefin to acrylate in the core rubber copolymer a and the component 2 comprising i 30 to 95 by weight of methyl methacrylate and ii 70 to 5 by weight of at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of unsaturated nitrile, aromatic vinyl compound, alkyl acrylate having an alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms and alkyl methacrylate having an alkyl group of 2 to 4 carbon atoms. The vinyl chloride polymer composition has excellent impact resistance, weatherability and processability.
