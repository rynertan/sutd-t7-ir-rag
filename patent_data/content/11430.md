# Improvements in waste gas recovery systems.

## Abstract
A waste gas recovery system employs a compressor 20 which takes in raw waste gas from an inlet knock out drum 10 and passes compressed gas through a heat exchanger 24 to an outlet knock out drum 11 . The temperature at the outlet of the compressor 20 is sensed by a device 18 which operates valves 28,29 to inject liquid coolant into the com pressor inlet and to re circulate gas back from the outlet of the outlet knock out drum 11 to inhibit an excessive temp erature rise. A pressure sensing device 19 senses the pres sure of the gas passing into the compressor 20 and controls both the speed of the compressor 20 and and adjustable throttle valve 27 to regulate the glas flow. The throttle valve 27 is closed automatically should there be a fall in the pres sure of the gas at the inlet below a safe level. In this event, further pressure sensing devices 92,97 act additionally to close the recirculating gas valve 29 and a further valve 84 in the main inlet flow path to reliably isolate the compressor 20 .
