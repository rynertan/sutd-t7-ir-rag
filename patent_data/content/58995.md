# Electrochromic display device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electrochromic display device having an electrochromic layer and a solid proton conductive layer between a transparent electrode and a counter electrode. The main component of the solid proton con ductive layer is a mixture of at least one of titanic acid, stannic acid, antimonic acid, zirconic acid, niobic acid, tantalic acid and silicic acid. The response time is short ened, the service life is prolonged, and printing may be adopted for formation of cells.
