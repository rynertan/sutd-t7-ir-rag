## Description
A MAGAZINE ARRANGEMENT FOR AN ORDNANCE DISPENSER This invention relates to the fiel.d of mine hunters and in particular is concerned with the construction of a portable ordnance dispenser POD for loading a PAP vehicle e.g. PAP 104 . The PAP is part of a mine hunting system designed for remote operation whereby to achieve the following amongst other objects the presence of human beings is not required within the danger area the destruction of the mine does not destroy the PAP, which deposits a charge near to the mine to be subsequently detonated the PAP can go into action faster than frogmen the PAP provides for identification of the mine from the mine hunter mothership the PAP, being a powered remotely operated and guided vehicle, can operate in conditions of current and wind driven seas including turbid conditions where frogmen could not operate. In one standard form, the PAP is equipped with the following components Two lateral electric variable,pitch propellers allowing continuous change from ahead to astern a guiderope allowing its course to be at constant height above the seabed a gyroscope for continuous determination of heading a wire bobbin through which the PAP receives control signals from a control console placed aboard and sends to the mothership the information about its work and condition a television camera and a searchlight a transponder tuned to the ship s sonar frequency locating equipment a flashlight and a pinger . a destruction charge. The mothership is fitted with In the Operations Room . a television monitor receiving the picture transmitted by the camera through the wire . a control console from which all the pre launch checkout operations can be carried out and all control signals can be released during vehicle operation On the quarter deck or the bridge an auxiliary portable remote control box allowing the guidance of the PAP during launching and recovery. An example of the characteristics of the charge is as follows Total weight 140 kg 309 lbs Explosive weight 100 kg 220 lbs Buoyancy 80 kg 176 lbs Overall length 932 mm 3.06 ft Maximum diameter 3 50xmme ft Of course, charges with other 4mensions can be adapted to the PAP. In operation, the PAP1 is mounted on the deck of the mothership. When it is oboe used a charge is loaded thereto and the PAP lowered into the sea by a crane boom or the like. The object of this invention is to increase the efficiency of the whole mine hunting operation by providing a loading magazine POD carrying a number of charges, for loading the PAP in a semi automatic way. According to the invention, there is provided a magazine arrangement for a portable ordnance dispenser for charge loading to a mine hunter vehicle, comprising first frame means for supporting said vehicle above the deck of a mothership second frame means supported by said first frame means to be rotatable about an axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of said vehicle means on said second frame means to support a plurality of charges radially spaced from said axis and lying on the periphery of said second frame means at spaced intervals thereon means to rotate said second frame means about said axis to index the second frame means into a plurality of rotational positions at each of which one of said charges lies on an upper portion of said second frame means in load position whereby to underly directly a said mine hunter vehicle when the latter is positioned on said first frame means and lift means adapted to raise a charge from load position to a loaded position on said vehicle. In a preferred aspect, the POD comprises the following major components a. Outer Casing which includes supports for the PAP104 and removable hatch to access charges .b. Outer Drum fabricated containing 6 charges and which rotates about c .c. Inner Drum which is resiliently mounted to brackets attached to the outer casing and accommodates d .d. Scissor lift mechanism for transferring charges from the drum to the PAP104.e. Outer Drum Rotating Device comprising 1 Shaft 2 Gearing and rotating handle 3 Toothed belts connecting shaft to the drum ends. The outer casing is of sandwich construction comprisingFoam GRP glass reinforced plastics material and includes a portable hatch, two lifting points, shock mount supports and supports for PAP104. The casing, connections to deck, hatch and penetrations are preferably weathertight. The portable hatch may be constructed of GRP and connected to the outer casing with 4 toggle catch fasteners. Locating pins may be fitted to the casing for correct location In the deck of the mine hunter. The outer drum supports six 6 charges distributed evenly around the drum in separate sub divisions and seated e.g. on formed hardwood packing. Each charge is restrained in position by two metal straps hinged at one end and fastened at the other by pin or wing nut.A suitable plastic strip can be bonded to the strap in sector of contact with the charge. The outer and inner drum bearings may comprise self lubricated plastic e.g. 2 layers one bonded to the outer drum, the other bonded to the inner drum. Drive belt channels may be fixed to both ends of the outer drum by brackets. A section of toothed belt is bonded to the channels, toothed sec tion facing up to provide a mating surface for the outer drum rotation belt. The inner drum is the fixed frame about which the outer drum rotates and in which is located the scissors lift. The inner drum is supported from the outer casing by shock mounts. The scissors lift mechanism is attached to the inner drum and can be mechanised or hydraulic in operation.If it is hydraulic, the hydraulic ram can be contained within the lift space available in the inner drum.The hydraulic system preferably has a relief valve for overload and includes a fail safe arrangement. Maximum exemplary dimensions of the lift are 450 mm long, 350 mm wide and 150 mm high closed . Minimum vertical travel for the lift is 650 mm. Lateral movement of the scissors lift in the raised position is best minimised. The legs may be fitted with self lubricated bushes. The upper platform of the scissors lift charge support cradles the charge and includes a roller spring configuration which allows the charge to be moved forward on the lift e.g. a distance of 30 mm, at least. Lateral restraints, for the charge, are fitted to the upper platform, in the form of a pinned flat bar, which is manually adjusted by the operator i.e. lifted from the horizontal to the vertical position. The outer drum rotating device comprises the shaft which may be 25 mm diameter connected to the outer casing at four 4 bearing positions two of which are located at the centre of the shaft both sides of worm spur gear the other two being at the ends outside the pulley positions . The pulleys and spur gear are keyed to the shaft using parallel keys. The pulleys are adapted to fit the toothed belt used for drum rotation. The spur gear worm gear may be arranged such that 120 x 3600 rotations of the handle relates to 1 drum revolution i.e. 3600 . For preference, the external handle for drum rotation is portable. Tensioning devices are located, one at each end of the shaft to maintain a satisfactory tension in the belts under shock. A mechanical limit stop is provided to ensure that each PAP charge can be accurately aligned for raising to the PAP104 from the stowed position.
