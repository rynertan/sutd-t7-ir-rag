# Polymers with graft alpha alkylarylate functionality.

## Abstract
alpha alkylacrylate functionality is added to an olefinically unsaturated polymer by reacting with a novel grafting agent in the presence of a hydrosilation catalyst to produce a polymer with at least one alpha alkylacrylate group attached pendently thereto. The grafting agent is a compound of structure A or B or a mixture thereof CHEM Where R 1 is an alkyl group R 2 is a divalent group nonreactive under hydrosilation reaction conditions n is o, 1,2,3, or 4 x and y are each 0,1,2,3 or 4 and x y 1,2,3, or 4 and the R 3 groups, which may be the same or different each represent alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, or CHEM in which R 1 and R 2 are as defined above.
