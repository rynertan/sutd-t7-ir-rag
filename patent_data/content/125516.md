# Granulating apparatus.

## Abstract
A granulating apparatus for continuously producing granules from powdery particles. The granulation chamber 8 of the apparatus comprises a feeder 11 for supplying powdery particles to te granulation chamber 8 and a spray nozzle 28 for ejecting a binder solution on the powdery particles held in the granulation chamber 8 . Powdery particles drying hot gas is supplied from the bottom of the granulation chamber 8 so as to vortically flow upward through the granulation chamber. The centrifugal force of the vortically flowing hot gas causes fully grown granules having a larger diameter to be distributed toward the peripheral wall 9 of the granulation chamber 8 . The granules fully grown to a prescribed size are selectively and continuously conveyed to a drying chamber through an out let port formed in the peripheral wall 9 of the granulation chamber 8 . The granules thus brought are thoroughly dried in the drying chamber 48 . In this way, powdery particles fully grown to granules having a prescribed size in an granu lation chamber 8 can be selectively and continuously dis charged.
