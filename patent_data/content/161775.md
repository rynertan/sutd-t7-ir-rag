# Ribbon drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A ribbon take up drive mechanism for a universal ribbon cartridge 1 is adapted to engage the ribbon drive shafts of printers of two different designs. The drive shaft positions are different, and the direction of drive shaft rotation is opposite for the two designs. The take up mechanism is designed such that the ribbon 9 is pinched between the teeth of a direct drive gear 33 and a biased idler gear 41 . The printer of one design drives the ribbon through the direct drive gear. The printer of the second design drives the ribbon through an alternative drive gear 63 , an idler gear 57 and the biased idler gear. In either case, the ribbon is advanced in the same direction.
