## Description
The invention relates to a catalyst composition com prising a carrier material consisting of an oxide of one or more elements having an atomic number between 12 and 15 Al₂O₃ and or SiO₂ , a bivalent metal com pound of group II of the Periodic Table and an active phase. Catalysts of this type are known in the art, inter alia from GB A 1,459,711 Kali Chemie A.G. , which dis closes alumina granules containing from 0.2 15 zinc in the form of oxide and up to about 1 of precious metal like platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium or rhenium. These catalysts are useful for reducing nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases. US A 3,278,453 Standard Oil Co. discloses catalysts comprising alumina, an alkaline earth metal oxide e.g. MgO and a group IIb metal oxide e.g. ZnO or CdO , which are useful for the dehydrogenation of lower alkenes and alkylbenzenes. Furthermore, ZnO is a well known component of methanol synthesis and low temperature shift catalysts cf. Catalysis and chemical processes, by Pearce Patterson, Leonard Hill, 1981, Chapter 6 . It has now been found that catalysts comprising alumina and or silica containing carrier material, a bivalent metal compound of group II of the Periodic Table and an active phase comprising at least two classes of metal compounds of which one is a group VIII metal and the other is a group VI metal, are very suit able for certain hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are highly active and usually have a long lifetime. Catalyst material, especially when used in fixed bed or ebullating bed type reactions, tends to wear off rela tively quickly, as a result of which considerable losses of the amount of catalyst arise. These losses make it necessary to regenerate and supplement the catalyst more quickly, while also more finely divided carrier material from the hydrogenated product has to be removed. The present invention provides a catalyst material mainly comprising a carrier of oxide of one or more of the elements aluminium and silicon, an oxide of a bi valent metal in an amount of between 0.1 and 10 wt. , preferably between 0.5 and 5 wt. of the catalyst material and a suitable active phase. The bivalent metal is preferably a group IIb and or IIa metal of the Periodic Table and has an atomic number between 11 and 31, preferably between 19 and 31. Particularly calcium, magnesium, barium and especially zinc are suitable. It is probable that the metal II oxide somehow enters into reaction with the aluminium oxide and or silicon dioxide of which the carrier mainly con sists and that, as a result thereof, its wearing resistance improves. It is surprising that, as a result thereof, especially the wearing resistance of aluminium trioxide carrier material is considerably improved. This effect is less marked in the case of silicon dioxide carrier material. Moreover, often also the catalytic activity of the active phase is increased by the group II metal. The catalyst material according to the present in vention can be prepared by first treating carrier par ticles consisting of Al₂O₃ and or SiO₂ for in stance according to the pore volume impregnation method with a solution of a salt of a suitable bivalent metal, preferably followed by calcination. Alternatively, the group II metal can be co impregnated with the group VI and group VIII metals or group II metals can be incorporated in the carrier paste prior to extrusion. Pseudoboehmite and transitional aluminas like gamma alumina, eta alumina, theta alumina, alpha alumina, silica and zeolites ex trudates are particularly suitable as carrier starting material. The carrier material used according to the present invention is mostly available as shaped forms such as granules, extrudates such as small rods etc. and this embodiment of the invention, in which the carrier material is present as shaped forms, is also encompassed. Further more, it has been observed that the improved wearing resistance of material according to the invention is often combined with a higher catalytic activity, possible a promotor like effect of e.g. zinc, magnesium and calcium. The catalytically active phase can be applied to the carrier material in various ways known per se. Various precipitation and impregnation methods are possible. It is also possible to combine the treat ment of the carrier material with a group II metal salt and apply the active phase in a single step or, al ternatively, to carry out both steps treatment with a group II metal and applying the active phase one after the other and to calcine in a single treatment. Cal cination is preferably carried out at 400 450 C and immediately after the bivalent metal has been applied. As catalytically active phase the following metallic compounds or mixtures thereof are suitable a group VIII metal compound, preferably oxide or sulphide, combined with a group VI metal compound, preferably oxide or sulphide. Examples thereof are nickel oxide and or cobalt oxide, nickel sulphide and or cobalt sulphide in combination with tungsten oxide and or sulphide and or molybdenum oxide and or sulphide. Preferably the group VIII metal has an atomic number between 26 and 29 cobalt and nickel , whereas the group VI metal belongs to group VIa having an atomic number between 41 and 75 molybdenum and tungsten . The nickel molybdenum and cobalt molybdenum combinations are preferred. The amount of nickel and or cobalt ranges between 2 and 5.5 , preferably 3 4 w w and the amount of molyb denum or tungsten between 8 and 22 , preferably 11 18 w w calculated as oxides based on the catalyst. Catalysts according to the present invention are par ticularly suitable for carrying out chemical reactions in solid bed or in ebullated bed, in particular for hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, such as e.g. de sulphurization, denitrogenization, hydrocracking of petroleum fractions , as well as for hydrogenation of mineral, vegetable or animal oils and fats. The present invention provides catalysts having im proved mechanical properties such as wearing resistance combined with good performance. This improved wearing resistance was determined by means of a simple acceler ated wearing resistance test. For that purpose a sample of carrier material was introduced into a cylindrical glass vessel. Two steel rods diameter 6.5 mm were also put in this cylinder and rolling was carried out for 1 hour on a mechanical roller at 100 rpm. The sample was then sieved on a 20 mesh sieve and the loss of weight that occurred was measured. A sample of un rolled blank starting material was sieved and the loss of weight fines was determined by weighing. The loss of weight of the treated material was then subtracted from the loss of weight of the above blank unrolled material. To convert this into a percentage, it should be divided by the amount of starting material minus the blank loss of weight and multiplied by 100. Measured in this way, the percentages of worn off carrier mass attrition could be reduced from 10 Al₂O₃ according to the prior art to approximately 4 for the same Al₂O₃, in which, according to the invention, 2 ZnO had been incorporated. The invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples. An amount of 100 g of a catalyst carrier SiO₂ 000 3E ex AKZO, Arnhem, Netherlands, internal surface area 200 m² g, pore volume H₂ 0.96 ml g, 3 mm extrudates was impregnated with a solution of 13 g Zn NO₃ ₂.6H₂O in 96 ml water according to the pore volume impregnation method. The impregnated catalyst carrier was dried at 120 C for a period of 16 hours and then calcined at 400 C for 2 hours. In the forced wearing resistance test, as described herein before, a reduction of attrition was observed for the ZnO containing carrier 11 wear after 1 hour for the carrier not impregnated with Zn II 5 wear after 1 hour for carrier material containing about 4 w w zinc oxide calculated . The treated and untreated carriers of Example 1 were used for the preparation of desulphurization catalysts for petroleum. After application of the active phase by means of pore volume impregnation with aqueous solutions of the nickel and molybdenum salts, the favourable effect of zinc oxide on the wearing resis tance as determined above remained intact. 100 g of the catalyst carrier gamma Al₂O₃ 001 1.5 E ex AKZO, Arnhem, Netherlands, internal surface area 250 m² g, pore volume H₂O 0.64 ml g, was impreg nated with a solution of a group II metal nitrate in such a way that after calcination at 450 C a carrier material was formed having about 2 metal oxide load Metal Ca, Mg, Zn . The attrition in the accelerated wearing resistance test appeared to have been improved considerably by applying 2 w w of a group II metal oxide, as appears below. The carriers impregnated and calcined with a group II metal oxide were used for the preparation of desulphur ization catalyst according to the pore volume impreg nation method with an aqueous solution containing the required nickel and molybdenum salt concentrations. The activity of these catalysts was compared with the de sulphurization activity of catalysts on a carrier which had not first been treated with a group II metallic compound. The desulphurization was carried out at 350 C, at 10 atm. total pressure in a stream of 200 ml min H₂. As feed, a mixture of toluene and thiophene was used in a ratio such that the sulphur content was 2.24 . Catalysts were sulphurated with H₂ H₂S 90 10. The desulphided percentage is listed in the following Table. From the above it will be clear that particularly calcium and zinc oxide had a favourable effect on the desulphurization activity, while the oxides of these metals also improved the wearing resistance.
