# Transmission chain.

## Abstract
The intercoupled links 1 of a chain for a conical disc transmission receive link pins 15 of which the end surfaces 21a, 21b bear against the discs, and in which the contact zones between the longitudinal sides 18a of the pins 15 and the links 1 are shorter than the upright sides 5a, 5b of the link openings and offset in longitudinal direction of the links with respect to the ends 7a, 7b of these sides.
