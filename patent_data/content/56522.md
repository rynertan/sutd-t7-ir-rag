# Reservoirs for liquid pressure control systems.

## Abstract
A liquid reservoir 14 for a hydraulic master cylinder, having a body 21 with a detachable cap 22 for refilling the reservoir, and a diaphragm 23 secured in position by the cap and dividing the reservoir into an air chamber 26 , vented to the atmosphere via a hole 28 in the cap 22 , and a liquid chamber 27 connected to the master cylinder. An inlet port 32 is provided in the wall of the reservoir for initial charging of the liquid into the liquid chamber 27 without removal of the cap 22 , the port 32 being closed by a plug 34 after the liquid reservoir has been filled. A method of filling a hydraulic control system which has such a reservoir is by the application of vacuum to the system via the inlet port 32 , introducing liquid into the system through the port, and subsequently sealing the port with the plug 34 .
