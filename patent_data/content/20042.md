## Description
NON PETROLEUM BASED METAL CORROSION INHIBITOR This invention relates to non pe troleum based metal corrosion inhibitors.Description of the Prior ArtMetal industries and, particularly, the steel industry are plagued with the problem of corrosion, e.g., rusting, of metal products, especially sheet products.With the more refined methods of producing higher grade steel sheets for use in automobiles, appliances and allied industries, the problem of rusting during the manufacturing process, storage and shipment has become a significant one. Various means have been and are being employed to combat this problem. Inhibited petroleum based oils are widely used as coatings for inhibiting the corrosion of various steels. This type of protection, however, is becoming increasingly impractical due to cost, the hazardous conditions created by the use of the petroleum based coatings, difficulty in removing the coatings and difficulty in disposing of the oil following its removal from the steel. Additionally, so called smudging is sometimes caused by the polymerization and oxidation of petroleum based inhibitor compositions. Since the surface of steel is microscopically porous, sufficient oil is absorbed into the surface to cause such smudging even after removal of the petroleum based inhibitor.In spite of these problems, these oil coatings continue to be used since they provide the required protection against corrosion and also serve to provide lubrication. It is an object of the present invention, therefore, to provide a non petroleum based metal corrosion inhibitor that will provide protection against oxidation and will provide lubricity equivalent or superior to that of petroleum based inhibitors when applied to metal surfaces but which will not possess the undesirable characteristics of such inhibitors. This and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following summary and description of preferred embodiments of the invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided a metal corrosion inhibiting composition which is a water based solution of 1 a C8 C20 aliphatic monobasic acid 2 a lubricant 3 an aminoalkylalkanolamine 4 an aromatic mono or polycarboxylic acid and 5 an amine which forms a water soluble salt with the acids.The composition can be applied to the metals by spraying or rolling. In a separate embodiment, a metal corrosion inhibiting composition which is a water based solution of the aliphatic, monobasic acid, the aromatic acid and amines is provided. The composition according to the present invention is generally prepared as a concentrated aqueous solution containing from about 25 to about 65 by weight of the non aqueous components. For application to metal surfaces, this concentrate is generally diluted up to about 5 times with water, i.e., 5 parts of water to 1 part of the concentrate. The composition offers protection against oxidation to aluminum, zinc coated or galvanized steel, aluminum coated steel, tin plated steel, stainless steel, high carbon electrical grade steel, cold rolled carbon steel and the like. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The non petroleum based corrosion inhibiting composition according to the present invention, including a preferred composition which contains a minor amount of a petroleum oil, appears to be an aqueous solution of a reaction mixture of the various components. The exact mechanism of the formation of the solution, however, is not known. Relatively high molecular weight aliphatic, monobasic acids are employed in preparing the nonpetroleum based composition according to the present invention. Aliphatic acids having from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms have been found to be useful in preparing the composition. These acids include fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, such as caprylic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid and resin acids such as abietic acid and acids isomeric therewith. These acids can be used alone or in combination. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a mixture of tall oil fatty acids and rosin, because of its availability and cost and the properties of the resultant corrosion inhibiting composition, is used as the high molecular weight aliphatic acid component of the composition. Such mixtures are obtained as a byproduct of the paper industry from tall oil usually recovered from pine wood black liquor . Oleic and linoleic acids are the major components of the tall oil fatty acids with acids such as palmitic acid, isostearic acid and stearic acid being present in relatively minor amounts. In a typical mixture of tall oil fatty acids and rosin useful in the present invention, oleic acid and linoleic acid comprise about 45 and 35 by weight, respectively, of the fatty acids. Rosin is mainly comprised of isomeric forms of abietic acid.The rosin can be present in amount of from about 5 to 4036 by weight preferably, 10 to 40 by weight, of the tall oil fatty acid rosin mixture. Mixtures containing less than about 54 by weight of rosin cannot be used because of problems relating to viscosity. Increased amounts of rosin appear to decrease the viscosity of the corrosion inhibiting composition. Mixtures containing more than about 40 rosin are not economical. Other mixtures of aliphatic acids such as tallow, the major constituents of which are oleic, palmitic, stearic, myristic and linoleic acids, can also be employed in preparing the non petroleum based corrosion inhibiting compositions according to the present invention. The high molecular weight aliphatic, monobasic acid component of the corrosion inhibiting composition is employed in an amount of about 5 to 20 parts by weight based on about 100 parts by weight of the concentrated solution. The composition according to the present invention typically contains a minor amount of a lubricant which may be either a petroleum or a nonpetroleum product. Any of the petroleum oils presently employed in petroleum based corrosion inhibiting compositions for steel are believed to be useful in the present composition. Good results have been obtained using a 100 SSU viscosity petroleum oil. In lieu of a petroleum oil, esters such as butyl stearate, dioctyl sebacate, butyl benzoate, or any of the light alkyl esters with boiling ranges above 3500F can be used as the lubricant. In a particularly preferred embodiment a petroleum oil is used as the lubricant. To obtain a stable aqueous solution of the composition the amount of lubricant is limited by the amount of the high molecular weight aliphatic acid.More particularly, the lubricant is employed in an amount of from about 10 to 2QS of the aliphatic acid, i.e., 0.5 to 4 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the concentrated solution. Amounts of greater than about 2 are not completely solubilized in the composition. In applications where lubrication requirements are not severe, the lubricant can be omitted from the metal corrosion inhibiting compositions. Such compositions will provide coatings which give good corrosion protection and which have a lubricity similar, for example, to soapy water. Such lubricity is believed to result from amine soaps or salts of the aliphatic and aromatic acids employed in the compositions. The aminoalkylalkanolamine of the metal corrosion inhibiting compositions according to this invention has the following general structural formula EMI5.1 Wherin RÚ and Rê are independently alkylidene of 1 4 carbon atoms and R3 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms. One or more of these aminoalkylalkanolamines can be employed in the non petroleum based inhibitor composition according to the present invention. Aminoethylethanolamine is presently preferred because of its cost and the good results that it provides. The specific use of the aminoalkylalkanolamine appears to be important to obtaining a stable lubricant containing composition which is completely clear, will not stratify or separate and which can be diluted up to about 5 times its weight with water. The amount of the aminoalkylalkanolamine typically employed is 0.5 to 4 parts by weight per lOO parts by weight of the concentrated solution. Greater amounts are not required for stability and are not warranted from the standpoint of cost. Where a lubricant is omitted from the metal corrosion inhibiting composition, the specific use of the aminoalkylalkanolamine does not appear to be required to obtain clear, stable solutions which provide good corrosion inhibiting coatings. The metal corrosion inhibiting composition according to the present invention includes as a corrosion inhibitor a water soluble amine salt of an aromatic acid. As the aromatic acid there may be employed an aromatic monocarboxylic acid such as benzoic acid or an aromatic polycarboxylic acid such as phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic or trimellitic acid. Mixtures of the aromatic acids may also be employed. Although it has not been confirmed, it is believed that the aromatic acids may also contain other functional groups such as hydroxy and lower alkyl groups which do not inhibit the formation of the water soluble salt. Good corrosion inhibiting effects have been obtained employing about 10 to 35 parts and, particularly, 24 to 35 parts of the aromatic acid per 100 parts by weight of the concentrated solution. Virtually any primary, secondary, tertiary or cyclic amine which forms the water soluble salt with the aromatic acid can be used in the composition according to the present invention to provide corrosion inhibiting properties. Particularly good results have been obtained with the use of lower C2 C4 alkanolamines and, particularly, monoethanolamine and diethanolamine. Other suitable amines are triethanol, diisopropylamine, cyclohexylamine and morpholine. The amines can be used alone or in combination. The amines employed in the metal corrosion inhibiting composition according to the present invention also serve to neutralize the aliphatic acid and appear to assist in the solubilization of the lubricant component.The total amount of amines employed in the composition, including the amount of aminoalkylalkanolamine, therefore, is generally in slight excess of the amount required to neutralize, i.e., form salts with, the aliphatic and aromatic acids. Depending on the amounts of the aliphatic and aromatic acids employed, this amount of the amine component is typically within the range of 5 to 25 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the concentrated solution. In preferred embodiments the amount is within the range of 15 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the concentrate. Although the total amount of the high molecular weight aliphatic monobasic acid, lubricant, aromatic acid and salt forming amines can vary within the ranges described above1 for practical use as a concentrate, the non aqueous components of the compositions are employed in an amount of from 25 to 65 parts per 100 parts by weight of the concentrate. In particularly preferred compositions, the non aqueous components are employed in an amount of from 55 to 65 parts per 100 parts by weight of the concentrate the remainder of the concentrate being water. To facilitate application of the corrosion inhibiting compositions to the metal surfaces, the concentrated solutions are diluted up to 5 times, preferably about 4 times, with water, i.e., up to 500 parts of water per 100 parts of the concentrate. The sequence of addition of the various components appears to be important to get a finished product which is clear, stable and which can be diluted to produce a stable product for final use. Generally, the mixture of the above described aliphatic, monobasic acid component and lubricant are added to water with stirring in a suitable mixing device. This is followed by the addition of the aminoalkylalkanolamine which causes the formation of a cloudy emulsion. An amount of the amine which forms the water soluble salt with the aromatic acid in excess of that required to form a clear solution from the cloudy emulsion is then added followed by the aromatic acid and the remainder of the salt forming amine. In another variation, a solution of the aromatic acid and salt forming amine can be added to a solution of the aliphatic acid lubricant aminoalkylalkanolamine.A unique characteristic of the present invention is that following these procedures, a lubricant, either natural or synthetic, can be completely solubilized in water when the amounts of the components of the nonpetroleum based inhibitor concentration are maintained within the ranges described above. The preparation of typical 55 gallon 208 litre batchs of concentrated solution of the non petroleum based corrosion inhibitor is described below approx imate weights are in parenthesis 1 Pump 30 gallons of water 250 lbs 114 litres, 113 kg. at li09F. 490. ..into tank and agitate. Add 10 gallons 38 litres of a tall oil fatty acid rosin mixture 80 lbs 36 kg sold under the tradename Unitol DT 40 by Union Camp and 1 or 2 gallons 3.Sor7.6 litres of 100 SSU viscosity petroleum oil 7 14 lbs 3.2 6.4 kg The oil will dissolve in the tall oil rosin mixture, but neither the petroleum oil not the tall oil fatty acid rosin mixture will dissolve in water. While agitating add one gallon of aminoethylethanolamine 8 lbs 3.6 kg . An oil in water emulsion will form. This emulsion is milky and complete ly opaque. Add 8 gallons 30 litres of monoethanolamine 64 lbs 29 kg. and the mixture will become clear and stable. Add 100 pounds 45 kg. of benzoic acid and the mixture will become hazy because of the portion of the benzoic acid which has not been neutralized to a soluble salt. To complete neutralization of the benzoic acid, add more monoethanolamine or morpholine, cyclohexylamine, etc. until the solution is completely clear and has a pH of 8.0 to 9.5. Continue mixing for 30 minutes and recheck pH. If pH drops below 8.0, add more mono ethanolamine to bring pH to 9.0. 2 Dump 30 gallons of water 250 lbs 114 litres, 113 kg at 110 1200F 43 490C into a tank, add 10 gallons 38 litres of tall oil fatty acids containing 8 12 rosin acids. While agitating, add one quart of aminoethylethanolamine. The tall oil rosin mixture will emulsify solution will be milky . Then add 2 1 2 gallons 9.5 litres of diethanolamine and the sol ution will clear and thicken. While agitat ing slowly add 45 pounds 20 kg. of terephthalic acid. ,The solution will remain clear and the viscosity will drop. Dilute up to 55 58 gallons 208 220 litres with water and continue agitating until all the terephthalic acid has diss olved. The viscosity of the finished solution at 100 F 380C will be about the same as a 30 wt commercial grade lubricating oil. For use at the mills or manufacturing plants, a composition prepared as described above is diluted with up to 5 parts of water and applied as either a rust preventative and or lubricant. The recommended dilution ratio is 1 part concentrate to about 4 parts water. Preferred compositions according to the present invention are formed by the sequential addition of the following compounds to 250 lbs about 30 gallons 113 kg, 114 litres of water with stirring weights are approximate a tall oil fatty acids rosin 80 lbs 36 kg b petroleum oil 100 SSU viscosity 7 14 lbs 3.2 6.4 kg c aminoethylethanolamine 8 lbs 3.6kg d monoethanolamine 16 lbs 7.3kg e benzoic acid 150 200 lbs 68 91 kg f monoethanolamine 75 100 lbs 34 45 kg and a tall oil fatty acids rosin 40 lbs 18kg b petroleum oil 3.5 7 lbs 1.6 ,3.2 kg c aminoethylethanolamine 41 lbs 19kg d monoethanolamine 8 lbs 3.6kg e benzoic acid 150 200 lbs 68 91kg f monoethanolamone 50 75 lbs 23 34 kg g diethanolamine 43 lbs 19.5kg The above formulations use only 1 or 2 gallons 3.8 or 7.6 litres of petroleum oil per fifty five gallon 208 litre batch of concentrate. When the concentrated solution is diluted four to one with water, it acts as a direct replacement for oil and replaces up to 200 gallons 757 litres solution.Actual tests have shown that when used as a replacement for oil, one quart 1 litre cf the solution replaces two gallons 7.6 litres of oil, so the overall use of oil by steel mil ls is reduced consider ably. With the cost of petroleum increasing dramatically the savings through the use of the compositions described herein are considerable. Also, large quantities of petroleum can be released for more important uses. Another advantage of this solution over petroleum based inhibitors is that the petroleum based compositions must be removed from the steel before it can be painted. When degreasing is performed, chlorinated solvents, such as trichloroethylene or perchloroethylene are used. Both are suspected carcinogens and usage of each is now restricted. EPA and OSHA have severely reduced the permissible limits of these substances in the atmosphere. Degreasing is also expensive. Oil disposal also presents an expensive problem. When washing is exercised to remove the oil, detergents and caustic solutions must be used. The wash water and oil cannot be discharged into the drainage systems. The composition according to the present invention does not have to be removed from the surface of metals prior to painting in most cases. However, when it must be removed, water will remove it from the surface.The water can be discharged into drains since the solution is biodegradable. The e application of the petroleum based inhibitor compositions at the mills creates further hazards because for every gallon of oil which is applied, some will drip off and create unsafe working conditions.When the oil is applied to sheets which are coiled, oil is spread throughout the area because of the centrifugal motion of the coiling operation. Solvents are used to clean the work area, which may create additional hazards.These operations are eliminated with the use of the non petroleum based corrosion inhibiting compositions according to the present invention. When employed in a steel making operation, the inhibitor composition of the present invention should be applied after pickling and hot roll reduction operations, and prior to cold reduction, because the cleaned pickled sheet is very susceptible to rusting.Reapplication of the composition after the final reduction protects the coils during storage prior to annealing. The composition can be reapplied at the temper mill operation, either on the entry or exit side of the temper mill. When the composition is applied at the entry side, a very fine mist application is desirable so as not to cause problems on the temper mill rolls. The composition is applied at the exit side of the temper mill either as a light or heavy spray.This also applies when the solution is applied at the stretch or shear line. Tests in a humidity cabinet or on coils stored for two months show that the protection afforded by the non petroleum based corrosion inhibitor composition of the present invention is as good, or better, than conventional inhibited oils. EXAMPLES To illustrate the corrosion inhibiting properties of the non petroleum based corrosion inhibitor compositions according to the present invention when applied to steel, the following compositions were prepared according to the general procedures described above.

TESTING PROCEDURE Cold roll dry strips 1 1 4 , 3.2cm. wide by 4 , 10.2cm. long, dry, clean and rust free were used as test specimens. A 1 16 1.6mm. hole was punched 1 8 3.2 mum. form the top and bottom, and 5 8 1.6 cm. from one side. A hook, fabricated from galvanized wire, was used to hang the strips in a humidity cabinet. Each strip was marked for identification by embossing a number with a metal stamp about 1 4 6.4mum. bolow the punched hole. To standardize the test, a strip as described above was dipped 2 5cm. in the solution to be tested and suspended by a metal hook with the dipped or coated portion of the strip at the bottom. The strip was allowed to dry or drain for one hour, and the hook transferred to the opposite end of the strip, which was then suspended on a rack in the humidity cabinet. The coated or dipped end was now on top, and the lower, uncoated end of the strip on the bottom. The conditions in the humidity cabinet were maintained a 1000F 380C and 100 humidity. Observations of the strip were made every 24 hours. The lower or dry parts of all strips were completely rusted after 24 hours. All tests were run for 120 hours. The condition of the coated parts were graded as follows A. Completely free of rust B. Slight rusting on the surface, but less than approximately 2 C. Rust on approximately 5 lOZ of the area D.
