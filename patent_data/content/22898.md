# Manufacturing process of sandals and clogs with plastic soles and shoes manufactured through this process.

## Abstract
The process bases on the use of a mould made up by two parts the first, the lower, containing the upside down print of that part of the sole which has to be contacted by the foot the second, that is the cover, containing the upside down print of that part of the sole which will touch the soil. The upper of the shoe, made up by two straps, have to be inserted, separately, before the moulding, in the flutings located on the edges of the lower part of the mould, while the surface which is to form the external part of the upper itself faces upward. At their ends inserted in the mould, these straps are equipped with holes which, during the moulding fill with the mix i.e. polyurethan, or PVC used for the manufacturing of the soles and after its solidification, give a high resistent linkage between each strap itself end the sole. This manufacturing process permits a reduction of sandals and clogs manufacturing cost since it is possible to eliminate all the workings required for the linking of the upper to the sole after the manufacturing of the sole as it happens in all the other manufacturing processes of clogs and sandals. Moreover, the so manufactured shoes are long wear, allow a safe deambulation and do not ruin the feet owing to strap movings.
