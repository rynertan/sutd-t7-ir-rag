# NEW ASSAY AND PURIFICATION OF AMYLOID COMPONENTS, APPLICATIONS, AND KITS THEREFOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a new method of immunological analysis for serum amyloid A protein SAA and serum amy loid P component SAP , kits therefor and a method of puri fication of SAA and SAP. These methods are based on the efficient binding of SAP to a plastic surface and to carriers bearing nitrated phenyl groups in the presence of calcium and related bivalent ions, and of SAA to a plastic surface and to carriers bearing nitrated phenyl groups with or with out calcium ions. The method of immunological analysis al lows for rapid and reliable screening of serum samples with a high sensitivity SAA and SAP play a key role in the diag nosis and management of inflammatory diseases.
