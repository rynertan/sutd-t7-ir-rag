# A rotary valve mechanism.

## Abstract
A rotary valve assembly 10 for an internal combustion engine has a split housing 23 21 22 which provides a cylindrical passage 26 within which a valve rotor 15 is located, surrounding the valve rotor is a sealing sleeve 27 which is biased into sealing contact with the rotor by means of the split housing, and the split housing is sealingly connected to a head 11 of an internal combustion engine by means of an annular seal 36 having a V shaped transverse longitudinal cross section. The annular seal may be made of a single piece of high temperature alloy steel with flexible flanges tapering to wards their inner circumference. This seal of relatively small diameter reduces the force applied to the rotor by combus tion gases.
