# Amorphous silicon photoreceptor.

## Abstract
An amorphous silicon a Si photoreceptor includes an amorphous silicon a Si photoconductive layer 2 , and a surface layer 3 disposed above the amorphous silicon a Si photoconductive layer 2 . An intermediate layer 4 is disposed between the amorphous silicon a Si photocon ductive layer 2 and the surface layer 3 to ensure the energy level matching. The intermediate layer 4 is made of amorphous silicon a Si doped with nitrogen and boron so as to have the energy difference of less than 0.2 eV between the bottom of the conduction bands of the surface layer 3 and the intermediate layer 4 .
