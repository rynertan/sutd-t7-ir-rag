# Camera drive.

## Abstract
A disc camera drive mechanism has a manually movable film advance member reciprocable between a rest and an ac tuated position, a shutter and a manually movable shutter re lease element. Drive means actuated by the film advance mem ber on its movement to actuated position rotates the disc film and activates spring means. Spring retainer means retains the spring means in activated position. Release of the spring means operates the shutter on actuation of the shutter release el ement. A spring urged film detent element is actuated by the drive means, and on release of the spring means the detent el ement is urged against the film during the latter part of its ad vance so as to engage a film detent opening when the latter comes into register. The detent element is withdrawn from the opening after the shutter is operated. A stop movable with the detent element may block shutter movement when the detent element is in its withdrawn position.
