# Tone signal generation device for an electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
A first waveshape memory 20 stores a full waveshape of a tone from the start to the end of sounding of the tone or a portion thereof in plural periods. A second waveshape memory 21 stores waveshape data of a modification waveshape for the full waveshape or the portion thereof. A tone waveshape signal read out from the first waveshape memory 20 and a modification waveshape signal read out from the second waveshape memory 21 are both multiplied with respective coefficients whereby these waveshape sig nals are weighted. These weighted waveshape signals are added together to provide a mixed tone signal. By controll ing the coefficients, the tone color imparted on the mixed signal is variously determined. The coefficients for the tone color control are provided in accordance with key scaling, key touch or operation states of control knobs. Thus, tone signals having a variety of tone color changes can be realized without the necessity of many wave memories.
