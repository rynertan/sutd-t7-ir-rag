# Temperature control system.

## Abstract
A temperature control system is disclosed wherein a heater of a gas sensor and a plurality of reference resistors cooperate to form a bridge circuit. The temperature control system comprises a comparator means for monitoring a balancing voltage of the bridge circuit and generating a control signal indicative of the balancing voltage and an electric power amplifier means responsive to the control signal for varying a voltage applied to the bridge circuit in such a manner to reduce the balancing voltage. The gas sensor has mounted therein at least one of the plurality of reference resistors, which reference resistor having a resis tance resulting from multiplying the resistance of the heater with a constant.
