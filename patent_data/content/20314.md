## Description
Cycloidal Transmission Having External Cam Curves The present invention relates to a cycloidal gear or transmission of the type having an input shaft and an output shaft and between the said two shafts cycloidal cam curves and rollers cooperating therewith for providing an increase or reduction of the gear or transmission ratio. Cycloidal transmissions are used to provide heavy reductions or increases of gear ratio since such transmissions obtain relatively small dimensions as compared with conventional spure gear transmissions for the same gear ratio. Since very large gear ratios can be obtained already by one cycloidal gear step, and since the gear exchange is mainly provided by rolling contact the cycloidal transmissions give small friction losses as compared with conventional spure gear transmissions. Cycloidal transmissions are previously known which comprise an input shaft on which two cycloidal cam curves generally having different numbers of curve cams are mounted eccentrically, one cam curve of which cooperates with cycloidal cam rollers which are fixed mounted in the transmission housing, and the second cycloidal cam curve of which cooperates with rollers which are mounted on the output shafL. The number of rollers generally are larger than the number of cams and lobes of the cycloidal cam curves, and when rotating the input shaft the two interconnected cycloidal cam curves are brought to rotate by a strongly reduced speed in a direction which is opposite to the direction of rotation of the input shaft. The second cycloidal cam curve in turn brings the output shaft to rotate actuated by the rollers with another speed than the rotational speed of the cycloidal cam curves. In the said previously known cycloidal transmissions at least one of the cycloidal cam curves and generally all cycloidal cam curves are mounted radially inside the cooperating rollers. In some cases this may involve problems as concerns removing of the heat developed in the cam curve wheels, and in other cases this is considered a limitation of the power transmitting ability of the cycloidal transmission, viz. if it is wanted to have relatively small dimensions of the cam curve wheels. For transmitting forces from the cam curve wheels to the cooperating rollers the said rollers also must be mounted on axial shafts or pins and this gives a structure having relatively large number of parts. In many cases it has also been considered necessary to form the cam wheels in one and the same piece of material what is a complicated and expensive method of manufacturing the cam curve wheels. Some other cycloidal transmissions of simil ar types have been formed with internal rollers in that the cam curve wheels are formed with a number of axial circular bores which cooperate with the rollers of the output shaft or the input shaft. Also in such structures problems may appear to remove the heat developed by the cooperation between the rollers and the internal circular bores. Also in this case the rollers must be mounted on shafts or pins, and depending on the relatively small diameter for the internal bores also the power transmitting ability is considered strongly limited. The object of the invention therefore is to solve the problem to provide a cycloidal transmission which is designed so as to give a larger torque transmitting ability than equivalent transmission of previously known type while maintaining the dimensions which is designed so that the heat developed in the cam curve wheels can easily be conducted away in which the cam curve wheels can be manufactured and mounted separately from each other, whereby said cam curve wheels can be manufactured according to simple operations and in which the power transmittance follows directly by rollers which need not be mounted on shafts or pins or similar means. Further characteristics of the invention will be evident from the following detailed specification in which reference will be made to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings figure 1 shows an axial cross section through a diagrammatically illustrated embodiment of a cycloidal transmission according to the invention. Figure 2 is a cross section along line II II of figure 1 whereby the upper half of the figure shows the function of a first cycloidal gear whereas the lower half shows the function of a second cycloidal gear. The cycloidal transmission illustrated in the drawing generally comprises a first shaft 1 and a second shaft 2 and a cycloidal means 3 interconnecting the said two shafts for providing an increase or reduction of the transmission ratio. The cycloidal transmission can be used either for increasing or for reducing the transmission ratio. In the following the transmission will only be described in connection to a reduction of the transmission ratio, whereby the first shaft 1 is the input shaft and the second shaft 2 is the output shaft. It is, however, obvious to the expert that the transmission is reversable so that the transmission can be driven from the second shaft, whereby output power is received at a higher speed at the first shaft 1. At one end the input shaft 1 is mounted in the transmission housing 4 by a roller bearing 5 and at the opposite end the input shaft is mounted in the output shaft 2 likewise by means of a roller bearing 6. Preferably the transmission housing 4 is preferably made in two halves 4 a and 4 b which can be parted, and the output shaft 2 is mounted in the second transmission housing half by means of two roller bearings 7 and 8 respectively. On the input shaft 1 an eccentric roller 9 is non rotatably mounted by means of a key 10, and by means of needle bearings 11 the eccentric roller supports a roller carrier 12 which at its outer periphery has serveral axial substantially semi cylindric grooves 13 for a first set of rollers 14 and a corre sponding set of axial and substantially semi cylindric grooves 15 for a second set of rollers 16. The roller grooves 13 are provided on a common radius the center of which coincides with the axis of the center bore 17 for the roller carrier 12. Corre spondingly the roller grooves 15 are provided on a radius the center of which coincides with the axis of the center bore 17.The numbers of grooves 13 and 15 may be identical or different, the grooves may have the same or different center radius and they may be provided adjacent each other or spaced from each other. In the following the effects will be discussed which are obtained at differing numbers of grooves 13 and 15 respectively.The rollers 14 and 16 have a diameter which substantially corresponds to the diameters of the roller grooves 13 and 15 so that the rollers with slight sliding fit are supported in the said grooves. The rollers 14 cooperate with a cycloidal cam curve disc 18 which by means of a key 19 is secured to the housing 4 and which is formed with several cam curves 20 and lobe curves 21 which are adapted to the rollers 14 and the eccentricity that the eccentric roller 9 gives to the roller carrier 12. The output shaft 12 is formed with a cup like cam disc carrier 22 which partly encloses the roller carrier 12. In the cam disc carrier 22 a second cycloidal cam curve disc 23 is mounted which cooperates with the rollers 16. The cam curve disc 23 is non rotatably mounted in the cam disc carrier 22 by means of a key 24 and the cam disc carrier 22 is freely rotatable inside the housing 4 together with the output shaft 2. The cam curve disc 23 is designed to match the rollers 16 and the eccentricity of the eccentric roller 9 so that the rollers 16 roll over the cam surfaces 25 and the lobe surfaces 26 of the cam curve disc 23 when the roller carrier 12 rotates in relation to the output shaft 2. As mentioned above the number of cam lobe surfaces may be larger or less than the number of rollers, and the difference in numbers may be one or several units. Generally, However, the number of cam lobe surfaces is one unit greater than the number of rollers. Supposing the number of cam lobe surfaces 20, 21 and 25, 26 respectively are the same the function of the appa ratus is the following If the housing 4 is stationary and non rotatably mounted and a driving force is applied to the input shaft 1 the said input shaft rotates together with the eccentric roller 9 which is fixed mounted thereon. The eccentric roller 9 in turn brings the roller carrier 12 to move eccentrically in a circle corresponding to the eccentricity as shown in figure 1.Since the cam curve disc 18 is non rotatably connected to the housing 4, the cam and lobe surfaces of the cam curve disc 18 forces by means of the rollers 14 the roller carrier 12 to rotate in a direction which is opposite to the direction of rotation of the input shaft 1. The rotation speed of the roller carrier is strongly reduced depending on the little difference between the numbers of rollers 23 and cam and lobe surfaces 20, 21. By means of the roller 16 the roller carrier 12 causes the second cam curve disc 23 to rotate under a rolling action of the rollers, whereby the output shaft 2 rotates in the opposite direction to the input shaft with a strongly reduced speed. The transmission ratio can be calculated according to the following general formula U 1 G in which G designates the basic transmission ratio . The ,ans mission ratio for the apparatus can be calculated according to the following formula EMI5.1 in which N1 designates the number of lobes of the cam curve disc 18 fixed connected to the housing, N11 designates the number of matching rollers 14, N2 designates the number of lobes on the out itjt cam curve disc 23, N2 designates the number of matching rollers 16, x designates the difference between the numbers of lobes and rollers at the input side 18, 14 , and y designates the difference of numbers of lobes and rollers at the output side 23, 16 . By changing the above mentioned variables N 1 N2 , x and y many different transmission ratios can be obtained, and in the following table there are shown some few examples of different transmission ratios which can be obtained by such varying values.

Thereby a large number of types of transmission ratios and degrees of transmission ratios can be obtained.
