# Charge transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
A charge transfer apparatus comprises a pulse generator 24 , a drive circuit 26, 28, 30, 32 for sending forth drive signals having a plurality of voltage levels in accordance with the pulse signals produced from the pulse generator 24 , and a charge coupled device 10 of the frame transfer type which is actuated by the drive signals and in which bias charges are previously injected into the potential wells of the light receiv ing section. The drive circuit 26, 28, 30, 32 comprises an analog multiplexer 78 for selectively sending forth a D.C. voltage signal in accordance with the pulse signal, during the vertical blanking period, injects an excess amount of bias charges into the potential wells and raises the bottoms of the potential wells to let an excess amount of bias charges over flow the potential wells for combination with holes.
