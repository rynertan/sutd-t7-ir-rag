# Process for cleaning metal filters.

## Abstract
A process for cleaning porous metal filters, particularly stainless steel filters, comprising the steps of 1 electrolyzing the filter in an electrolyte bath using the filter as one of the electrodes, preferably as the cathode of the electrolytic system, and subjecting the system to an imposed or applied current, highly preferably a DC current and 2 rinsing the filter to remove electrolytic solution from the filter and flush any residual contaminants from the filter. When organic material is to be removed, a baking step prior to the electrolysis step is used.
