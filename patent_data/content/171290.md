## Description
TITLEIMPROVED FLUOROPOLYMER FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an improved fluoropolymer. The fluoropolymer is improved in that it cures faster, yielding a product with a tighter cure, which releases better from the mold than many known peroxide curable fluoroelastomers. This invention also relates to a process of injection molding the improved fluoropolymer. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART It is known in the art to produce fluoropolymers that may be cured by the reaction of a curing agent crosslinking agent on reactive sites in the polymer chain. In particular it is known to produce fluoropolymers of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene and 4 bromo 3,3,4,4tetrafluorobutene l in which the amount of bromine containing monomer is present in the polymer in amounts up to 3 mole See Apotheker et al U.S.patent 4,035,565 especially example 10. 4 iodo 3,3,4,4 tetrafluorobutene l is a known chemical compound, see C. S. Rondestvedt s article in Journal of Organic Chemistry Vol 42 pages 1985 90 1977 , and its use in polymerization reactions with tetrafluoroethylene and fluorinated alkyl ethylenes is disclosed in Fritchel BelgianPatent 890,476. Curable fluoropolymers containing iodo fluoroalkenes such as monoiodotrifluoroethylene, and alkanes such as 1,4 diiodoperfluoro n butane are disclosed in Tatemoto et al., U.S. patent 4,243,770. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that fluoropolymers containing 4 iodo 3,3,4,4 tetrafluorobutene l, and other similar iodinated monomers of the formulaEMI2.1 when present as polymerized units, formed by.addition polymerization, approximately uniformly distributed along the polymer chain in the amount of 0.1 to 2 mole percent based on the total moles of polymerized units present in a fluoropolymer, said fluoropolymer also containing complemental amounts of polymerized units derived from vinylidene fluoride and at least one fluorine containing olefin selected from the class consisting of hexafluoropropylene, pentafluoropropylene, and perfluoroalkylvinyl ethers such as perfluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl ether in which the alkyl groups have 1 to 5 carbon atoms, have unexpectedly good curing properties, and the cured product has unexpectedly good elastomeric properties. The non iodinated portion of the fluoropolymer Lay optionally contain polymerized tetrafluoroethylene units, or chlorotrifluoroethylene units. Fluoropolymers containing 4 iodo 3,3,4r4, tetrafluorobutene l polymerized units or other similar polymerized units in the ranges specified, are superior in many respects to polymers containing an equal molar amount of 4 bromo 3,3,4,4 tetrafluorobutene l i.e. the polymer of U.S. 4,035,565 to Apotheker et al. In the fluoropolymers of this invention the amount of polymerized units derived from vinylidene fluoride is typically in the range of about 45 to 80 mole percent of the units in the fluoropolymer. The amount of fluorine containing olefin, other than vinylidene fluoride in the fluoropolymers of the invention is typically in the range of 20 to 55 mole percent of the units in the fluoropolymer. More than one fluorine containing olefin may be present as polymerized units in the polymers of this invention.Furthermore, optional components may be present in the fluoropolymers of this invention, e.g.chlorotrifluoroethylene and or tetrafluoroethylene may be present in the amount of up to about 20 mole percent of the polymerized units in the fluoropolymer. The superiority of polymers containing the polymerized iodo units over the polymers containing an equal molar amount of the polymerized bromo units is evident from results obtained in curing the two polymers. The polymer containing the iodo polymerized units cures faster it exhibits a higher cure state it has better compression set resistance. The uncured iodo unit containing polymer has a lower polymer viscosity than the uncured bromo unit containing polymer the lower viscosity is a processing advantage in many applications. When the polymers of this invention are cured in a mold to form articles, the articles are more easily separated from the mold than are articles molded from a polymer containing an equal mole fraction of the bromo containing monomer.With the greater ease of removal of articles from the mold, the uncured compositions of the invention can be injection molded. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The fluoropolymers of this invention consist essentially of interpolymerized units of a between 0.1 and 2 mole percent, based on the total moles of components a and b of units derived from the addition polymerization of a compound having the formulaEMI4.1 where I is iodine, X and Y are hydrogen or fluorine, R is selected from the class consisting of i alkyl groups of 1 to 6 carbon atom s having one or two iodine atom s bonded to a carbon atom in the alkyl group, and additional atoms selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine and fluorine bonded to the carbon atom s in the alkyl group, and ii an ether group with an ether oxygen bonded to theCX2 CY group, containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms in which one iodine atom and other atoms selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, chlorine, and fluorine are bonded to the carbon atoms of the ether group, where n and m are zero or 1, and when n is 1, m is zero, and when m is 1, n is zero, and when n is 1 and either X is fluorine, then R is the ii member of the class having a terminal ether link. By terminal ether link is meant CX 2 CY O R1 where the is the remainder of the R group as defined above. In the polymer of this invention, these a units are distributed randomly approximately uniformly along all of the polymer molecules. and, b a complemental amount of units derived fray the addition polymerization of vinylidene fluoride, and at least one fluorine containing olefin selected from the class consisting of hexafluoropropylene, pentafluoropropylene, a perfluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl ether in which the alkyl group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and optionally tetrafluoroethylene or chlorotrifluoroethylene. Particular monomers within the scope of the above formula that are useful in preparing the polymer compositions of the invention are CH2 CH CF2 xI where x is 0 to 6,CH2 CHCFClCF2I, CH2 CH O CF2 CF2I,CF2 CF O CF2CF2I,EMI5.1 CH2 CH O CH2CH2I, CH2 CHCF2CFICF3 andCF2 CFI. The polymers of the invention are prepared by polymerization of an iodine containing monomer with vinylidene fluoride and a fluorine containing olefin by emulsion processes in which all monomers are continuously added to the reactor in much the same manner as the prior art polymerizes a bromine containing monomer, i.e. Apotheker et al. 4,035,565Example 10. For further details on such emulsion polymerization processes see Moore U.S. Pat. 3,839,305 and Gladding et al. U.S. Pat. 3,707,529.If all of the monomers are not continuously added to the reactor the iodine containing units will not be distributed randomly along all of the polymer molecules. If the units are not randomly distributed along the polymer chain the resulting polymer will not exhibit the property improvements discussed below. The cured polymers of the present invention can exhibit compression set test results superior to previously known peroxide curable fluorinated elastomers. This is believed to be due to the branching and cross linking from the iodine containing monomers being distributed along the entire length of the individual polymer chains. In order to achieve this distribution it is necessary to continuously add all of the monomers being polymerized rather than use a batch polymerization. If a batch polymerization is used as in U.S.3,351,619 the less reactive monomers are not randomly distributed along the polymer chain. In U.S. 4,243,770 an iodine containing monomeric compound is charged to the reactor at the beginning of the reaction and then a mixture of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene are continuously charged to the reactor. In the case of iodo compounds which do not ccntain ethylenic unsaturation there is no branching and the iodine winds up at the end of a polymer chain through a chain transfer mechanism. In the cate of an iodo compound such as CF2 CFCF2f F2CI C CF2 CFCF2CF2I the reaction if the iodine as a chain transfer agent and t polymerization of the ethylenic unsaturation compete with each other. If the chain transfer reaction occurs first there is no branching.If the polymerization occurs first there is a branch, but if the originally charged iodo compound exhibits a substantially greater reactivity as a chain transfer agent than its polymerization reactivity as in the case of the above mentioned monomer there is little branching.The monomers of the structureEMI6.1 as defined above have substantially greater reactivities towards addition polymerization than towards chain transfer through the iodo substituent and thus become randomly distributed along the polymer molecules. After curing the elastomers of the present invention exhibit superior recovery than prior related elastomers after being subjected to the compression set test both when tested at room temperature and elevated temperatures. The polymers of this invention may be cured by conventional curing agents in a conventional manner. Again, see Apotheker et al. U.S. Patent 4,035,565 for conventional information on curing such materials. Typically the polymers of this invention are mixed for example on a rubber mill, or in an extruder or in an internal mixer, or in the barrel of an injection molding machine, with an organic peroxide radical trap and acid acceptor and cured by heating the mixture to a temperature at which the peroxide decomposes. The heating step may take place in a closed mold or a mold open to the atmosphere.If desired the resultant elastomer may, after initial cure, be further cured by further heating after its removal from the mold. A preferred class of fluoropolymer of the present invention is one that contains in addition to the polymerized iodinated monomer units and the vinylidene fluoride units, more than one type of fluorinated olefin unit, for example a polymer that contains units obtained by the polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene, and hexafluoropropylene. Another preferred class of polymers of the invention contain the polymerized iodinated monomer units, polymerized vinylidene fluoride units and only one other fluorinated olefin unit, for example the other fluorinated olefin unit may be polymerized hexafluoropropylene units. A third preferred class of polymers of the invention are those that contain in addition to the polymerized iodinated monomer units, vinylidene fluoride units, perfluoroalkyl perfluorovinyl ether units where the alkyl group contains 1 to S carbon atoms, for example perfluoromethyl perfluorovinyl ether is ordinarily a satisfactory monomer and optionally tetrafluoroethylene units. The addition of other compounds such as methylene iodide CH212 , saturated perfluorinated iodo compounds and or isopropyl alcohol to the polymerization reaction will cause a chain transfer reaction to take place, which will reduce the gel content of the polymer, and reduce the molecular weight of the polymer. Other chain transfer agents may be used, such as those disclosed in Moore U.S. Patent 3,839,305. The polymer of this invention may be blended with the prior art peroxide curable elastomers, such as bromine containing vinylidene fluoride polymers, and then cured to obtain results intermediate between the results of the prior art and the results of curing the polymers of this invention. In the examples which follow various properties of the polymers of this invention and properties of products made by curing the polymers of this invention are set forth. These properties are measured according to the following tests A. Vulcanizate properties 1. Mooney Viscosity A Monsanto Mooney Viscometer is used to measure viscosity and scorch of rubber compounds.This is done by rotation of a flat cylindrical disk embedded in an elastomer specimen which is confined in a heated 100 C or 1210C, as specified die cavity, at 90 psi, and exerts a shear strain on the specimen. The force required to turn the disk is a measure of the shearing viscosity ASTM D 1646 81 .The ML 10 is the force reading after a 1 minute preheat and a ten minute test. 2. Tensile Strength and Elongation test temperature 250C die from Boston Dies. No. FD 492G or No. RB 326. An Instron universal testing instrument is used in elongating tensile specimens to failure and measuring the force required to make the specimen fail. Dumbbell type specimens are used in this measurement ASTM D 412 80 . In the examples the values given are measured on samples that have been cured in the mold press cured and then cured out of the mold post cured , or press cured, post cured and heat aged. The curing conditions unless otherwise noted were press cure 15 min 1770C, post cure 24 hrs 2320C, heat age 70 hrs 2750C. The tensile strength at 100 elongation is reported herein as M100. The tensile strength at break is reported herein as TB The elongation at break is reported herein as EB. Values for M100 and TB are given in psi and MPa, conversion is MPa 0.006895 x psi. 3. Oscillating Disc Rheometer ODR ASTM D 2084 81 A polymer specimen is contained within a vulcanization chamber under 1770C and 90 psi 6.2Mpa pressure. For 12 minutes, a disc is oscillated through a 10 arc exerting a shear strain on the specimen. The force torque required to oscillate the disc is proportional to the stiffness shear modulus of the polymer. From ODR the following data is reported. ML minimum torque of resulting curve t minutes to 2 in.lb 0.2 N.m rise above ML MH maximum torque, or torque at the end of the heating time here 12 min whichever is greater. t 90 minutes to 90 of torque increase from M1 i.e., at Mc90 Mc90 the torque at 90 cure i.e., Mc90 My 90 MH ML 10 0 Values are given in N M and in lbs with conversion N M 0.113 x in lb. 4. Compression Set The residual deformation of a material after removal of a compressive stress to give 25 compression from original height at an indicated test time and temperature. The samples are tested after press cure 15 min at 1770C and post cure 24 hr at 2320C . The o ring test is modified by the use of whole ring samples using a press which allows trapped air to escape. ASTM D395 82 for pellets,ASTM D7414 part 3.8 for o rings. All samples tested for compression set were press cured for 15 minutes at 177 C, and post cured in a circulating air oven for 24 hours at 2320C before testing B.Folymer Properties 1. I is determined by burning a sample by the standard Schoniger oxygen flask method then converting the iodine fragments to iodate and titrating the jodate according to Standard Methods ofAnalytical Chemistry 6th Ed. Vol. 1, p. 522 edited byScott. 2 Br as described in Cotbre, E, Trantham, B.V., Bowman, R.L, and Bethesda, The Journal ofLaboratory and Clinical Medicine 51 461 1958 . 3. gel A 1 dispersion of polymer in methyl efiyl ketone is dissolved overnight and then centrifuged 17000 rpm, room temperature, 30 min . The concentration of the solution above the separated solids is determined by removal of solvent from a known volume of solution. The gel insolubles is determined by subtraction. 4. The weight percent of the polymerized units of the polY incorrected for the presence of the iodine containing polymerized units was determined by ATR ir attenuated total reflectance by infrared spectroscopy the technique is further described in Applied Spectroscopy Review, Vol 18, Issue 3, page 329 1983 by W. L. Truett et al. . The following examples illustrate the invention and some of the examples demonstrate the superior properties of the polymers and products made from the polymers of the invention as compared to control examples of the bromine containing polymers taught in the prior art.Example 1 Curable fluoropolymers containing vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene, tetrafluoroethylene and 4 iodo 3,3,4,4 tetrafluorobutene l were prepared by a continuous process having the following steps The four components were added continuously into a 2.0 liter stainless steel reactor at 1150C and 6.3 MPa pressure and underwent an emulsion polymerization as they passed through the reactor.The residence time in the reactor was 24 minutes based on the aqueous feed rate of 5 liters per hour using monomer feed rates shown in Table 1. An aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate, sodium hydroxide and Zonyl UR, Zonyl UR is a mixture of monosodium salts of mono and bisfluoroalkyl phosphates was added during the polymerization. The copolymer latex was passed through a container at atmospheric pressure and the off gas unreacted monomers was analyzed by gas chromatography. After discarding the latex formed from the first four residence times, a sample of latex was collected.The copolymer was isolated by the gradual addition of a 4 aqueous solution of potassium aluminum sulfate to coagulate the copolymer. These particles were washed with water and dried at 1000 to a moisture content of 1 . The polymer obtained was mixed with the following ingredients on a two roll rubber mill 100 parts of polymer, 30 parts of medium thermal MT carbon black ASTM designation N 990 , 3 parts of lead oxide Litharge , PbO, 3 parts of peroxide Luperco 101 XL 45 of 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butyl peroxy hexane adsorbed onto 55 CaCO3 or Luperco 130 XL 45 of 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di ditertiarybutylperoxy hexyne 3 adsorbed onto 55 CaCO3, see Table II and 3 parts of triallylisocyanurate.
