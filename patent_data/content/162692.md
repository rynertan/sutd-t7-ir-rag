# IMPROVED ORTHOPEDIC SPLINT ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A splint device for the immobilization of a preselected portion of the body, such as a digital member. The splint device preferably comprises a splint means comprising a ring like base portion adapted to fit snugly around a digit in proximity to its proximal end. Extending from the base por tion there are provided a plurality of essentially rigid elon gated support members which are spaced apart around the base portion so as to immobilize the contained digit, pref erably on more than one of its sides, each of the support members terminating at a free end which is in the vicinity of, or beyond the distal end, of the digit. The ring like base portion is preferably expandable. The splint device may also comprise restraining means which may be positioned around the support member for retaining the support members ad jacent the digital member, and an end cap which may be positioned on the free ends of the support members.
