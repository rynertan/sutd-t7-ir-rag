# Adhesive coated multifilament yarn of an aromatic polyamide and a method for the manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A multifilament yarn of an aromatic polyamide, in particular poly p phenylene terephthalamide, is provided with an adhesive coating of a cured epoxy compound, the yarn having a free epoxide content not higher than 10 mmoles kg. The yarn is made by spinning a solution of an aromatic polyamide into a coagulation bath and subjecting the resulting filaments to the subsequent steps of washing, applying a curable epoxy compound and one or more alkaline curing agents, curing and winding the yarn thus treated into a package. The resulting yarn can be processed into a reinforcing element for, e.g., tyres in a one step dipping process. A cord made from the yarn displays an improved resorcinol formaldehyde latex dip pickup.
