Of the compounds of formula I which are used as starting materials. in the process. of this invention, those in which R1 and R3 are hydrogen atoms, R2 is a hydroxyl group which may be protected,R4 is CH2 CH2 , and Y is a protected amino group,namely compounds of the following formulaEMI22.1 wherein Z represents a hydroxyl group which may be protected, and R5 and Y.are as defined above, are known compounds which are generally disclosed in the specification of U.S. Patent No. 4,372,965. But this specification fails to describe anything about compounds of formula I 3 in which Y at least represents a group of the formulaEMI23.1 wherein R7 and R8 are as defined herein above, and therefore, such compounds are novel compounds. Compounds of formula I in which R1 throughR4 are.defined hereinabove excepting the definitions given immediately above are novel compounds not described in the prior literature. These novel compounds can be produced by the same method as.in the case of producing the above known compounds.Specifically, the compounds of formula I can be produced by S oxidation of compounds of the followingEMI23.2 wherein m is 0 or 1, and RL, R2, R3, R4, R5 and Y are as defined hereinabove. S oxidation of the compounds of formula VI can be carried out by methods known per se, for example by methods frequently utilized in the Soxidation of sulfur containing beta lactam type antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. For example, the compound of formula VI is reacted with a mild oxidizing agent which does not sub stantially act on the 7 oxo l azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylic acid skeleton, such as benzoic acid, phenyldichloroiodide, hydrogen peroxide, selenium dioxide and sodium meta periodide.Organic peracids are suitable as such mild oxidizing agents, especially suitable being perbenzoic acid and m chloroperbenzoic acid. Substituted perbenzoic acids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid are especially preferred. The reaction of the compound of formula VI with the oxidizing agent is advantageously carried out in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride at a mild temperature, for example, 0 to 50 C, preferably 0 to 25 C. Under these conditions, the reaction can be terminated usually in 3 minutes to 3 hours. The amount of the oxidizing agent used to oxidize the compound of formula VI can be varied widely depending upon the type of the oxidizing agent, the reaction conditions, etc. Generally, it is 2 to 5 mole equivalents, preferably 2 to 3 mole equivalents, per mole of the compound of formula VI when m is 0, and 1.0 to 1.8 mole equivalents, preferably 1.0 to 1.3 mole equivalents, per mole of the compound of formula VI when m is 1. After the reaction, the compound of formula I as an S oxidation product can be isolated and purified by various methods known per se. Usually, it can be isolated from the reaction mixture by methods which are frequently utilized in the isolation and purification of antibiotics. These compounds of formula I can be used in the aforesaid reaction. When in the S oxidation of the compound of formula I or its salt, R2 represents a hydroxyl group which may be protected or a hydroxymethyl group which may be protected, and a primary or secondary hydroxyl group exists as a substituent on the 6 position side chain for example, 2 hydroxyisopropyli dene or l hydroxyethyl , the hydroxyl group is preferably protected. Furthermore, when the protected amino group for Y has basicity for example, when Y represents an amino group which is mono or disubstituted by alkyl or aralkyl , the S oxidation may simultaneously oxidize the N atom of the amino group, thus forming an N oxide. The reaction in accordance with this invention similarly proceeds even when the protected amino group Y is oxidized. Specific examples of the compounds of formula I so producei are given below in addition to those given in Examples below.

Some of the compounds of formula VI used in the S oxidation are known see U. S. Patent Nos.4,318,916, 4,168,268, 4,162,323, 4,368,203, 4,269,873, 4,264,736, 4,264,734, 4,264,735, 4,387,052, 4,341,706, 4,234,920, 4,123,547 and 4,150,145 and European LaidOpen Patent Publications Nos. 1,627, 1,628 and 44,142 , or disclosed in the Journal of Antibiotics, 34, pages 909 et seq. 1981 . Novel compounds of formula VI can be produced in the same way as in the production of the known compounds. In particular, among the novel compounds mentioned above, those of the following formulaEMI27.1 wherein R5, R6 and R7 are as defined above, can be prepared by esterifying antibiotic OA 6129 B1 orB2 represented by the following formulaEMI27.2 produced by the method described in European LaidOpen Patent Publication No. 44,142, at its carboxyl group by known methods for production of carboxylic acid esters, reacting the resulting ester having the group R5 with a ketone or aldehyde derivative to etherify the hydroxyl groups at the alpha and gamma positions of the panthoyl group simultaneously and thus obtain a cyclic ketal or cyclic acetal, and further subjecting the resulting compound to dehydration reaction in an inert solvent using a combination of triphenylphosphine and an azodicarboxylic acid diester see, for example,Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 32478 1981 . Although in the present specification and claims, all chemical formulae are described in their planar structure for the sake of simplicity, it should be understood that the compounds of formula I as the starting materials and the compounds of formula III as the products include. stereoisomers and optical isomers. Thus, for example, the above formula III includes the following two stereoisomers and a mixture of these.EMI28.1 5,6 trans isomer When R1 represents a hydroxyl group, the carbon atom to which R1 is bonded is an asymmetric carbon atom. In this case, the compounds of formula III may take both S and R steric configurations. The compounds of formula III or the salts thereof obtained by the process of this invention have excellent antibacterial activity, and can be used as an active ingredient of antibacterial agents for the prevention, therapy and or treatment of infections caused by Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria not only in man but also in other animals such as mammals, poultry and fish.
