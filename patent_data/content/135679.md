## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF TEE INVENTION The present invention relates to thermoplastic compositions having improved hydrolytic stability.More particularly, it relates to aromatic carbonate polymer resin mixtures with greater than 50 mole percent carbonate linkages having improved retainedS tensile impact strength after exposure to moisture for extended periods of time. Aromatic carbonate polymers are well known, commercially available materials having a wide variety of applications in the plastics art. Such carbonate polymers may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol, such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, in the presence of an acid binding agent. Generally speaking, aromatic polycarbonate resins offer a high resistance to the attack of mineral acids, may be readily molded, and are physiologically harmless as well as strain resistant.It is also known that the S tensile impact properties of polycarbonate resins decrease upon prolonged exposure to moisture. Polycarbonate resins therefore do not perform as well as could be desired in outdoor uses where they will be exposed to extended weathering effects. These characteristics consequently limit the fields of application for unmodified aromatic polycarbonate resins. In an effort to improve the behavior of polycarbonate resins, it has been proposed to add modifiers to the polycarbonate. In Goldblum, U.S. 3,431,224, for example, it is proposed to add modifiers, in certain proportions, the modifiers comprising at least one member of the class consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, a copolymer of ethylene and an ethyl acrylate, a copolymer of ethylene and propylene, a cellulose ester, a polyamide, a polyvinyl acetal, an alkyl cellulose ester, and a polyurethane elastomer to increase the stress cracking resistance.Although the results with such modifiers are generally excellent in thin sections, e.g., in parts of 3.2mm thickness, there is a tendency for impact failure to occur with these modifiers in thicker molded parts of 6.4mm or more, and such failure is of the undesirable brittle type. Another modifier proposed to be added to polycarbonate is reported in Research Disclosure No. 20810,Dow Chemical Company, August 1981. Data are provided showing that polycarbonate modified with a linear low density polyolefin, namely ethylene octene l copolymer, provide good impact strength at increased part thickness. In U.S. Patent No. 4,245,058 to Liu, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, it is disclosed that compositions comprising a high molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate, an acrylate copolymer and a polyolefin exhibit improved aged impact strength, both low and high temperature impact strength and good weld line strength as compared with unmodified polycarbonate. Although many of the above mentioned patents provide aromatic carbonate polymer compositions possessing good impact strength at room temperature and in thinner sections, and some possess good impact properties over broad temperature ranges and section thicknesses, generally, they all fail to address the problem of hydrolytic stability for polycarbonate compositions, and hydrolytically stable polycarbonate compositions are still desired. SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION Unexpectedly, in view of the foregoing, it has now been discovered that an aromatic carbonate polymer resin mixture comprising an admixture of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a copolyestercarbonate wherein there is a preponderance of carbonate linkages as opposed to ester linkages in said admixture has improved retained S tensile impact strength after prolonged exposure to moisture, when a hydrolytically stabilizing amount of a polyolefin resin, preferably a linear low density polyolefin resin is added to the mixture. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there is an aromatic carbonate polymer composition comprising an admixture of a. an aromatic polycarbonate b. an aromatic copolyestercarbonate, and c. a hydrolytic stabilizing effective amount of a polyolefin, wherein there is a preponderance of carbonate bonds as opposed to ester bonds in the total of a and b. The phrase preponderance of carbonate bonds as opposed to ester bonds means that in the admixture of aromatic polycarbonate and copolyestercarbonate, greater than fifty 50 mole percent of the total ester and carbonate bonds should be carbonate. In other words there should be more polycarbonate than polyester . When there are more carbonate bonds the admixture generally becomes more polycarbonate like and has more of the properties of polycarbonate. However when the polyolefin is added to the aromatic polycarbonate and copolyestercarbonate mixture the polycarbonate characteristics with respect to upgrading the 6.4mmNotched Izod impact and double gate weld line strength impact are not observed. Rather the substan tial increase in retained hydrolytic stability as shown in the S tensile impact test is surprisingly observed. The polyolefin employed in the invention is polyethylene, polypropylene and in general any polymer of a mono oleo in having from two to eight carbon atoms, inclusive. Examples of such olefines include ethylene, propylene, butene l, isobutene, 4 methyl l pentene and the like. Copolyolefins are also employed, particularly ethylene and propylene. Various densities of the polymers may be employed, however a linear low density polyolefin, particularly polyethylene is preferred. The preferred linear low density polyolefin component may be prepared by state of the art polymerization processes such as those described in U.S. Patent No.4,076,698 and Eur. Pat. Appl. 4,645, both of which are incorporated by reference. The polymer may have a density between 0.89 and 0.96 g. cc. and a controlled concentration of simple side chain branching as opposed to random branching which distinguishes it from polymers such as high pressure low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene. The preferred range of density is 0.915 to 0.945 g. cc. The linear low density polymers preferably are made from ethylene and an alpha olefin of C3 to C8 carbon content, e.g., butene l and octene l, or mixtures of such alphaolefins. The comonomer is used in a minor amount, e.g., 10 mole or less of the total amount of monomers. A preferred range is about 1 3 mole . Preferred copolymers are copolymers made from ethylene and butene l such as Escorene LPX l having a density of 0.910 g cc LPX 12 having a density of 0.912 g cc andLPX 16 having a density of 0.916, from Exxon, Houston,Texas. Another preferred copolymer is a copolymer made from ethylene and octene l, Dowlex 61500 .42, DowChemical Company. The aromatic polycarbonate resins for use herein as component a i may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, a haloformate or a carbonate ester. Generally speaking, such carbonate polymers may be typified as possessing recurring structural units of the formula EMI5.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction. Preferably, the carbonate polymers used to provide the resinous mixtures of the invention have an intrinsic viscosity as measured in methylene chloride at 250C. ranging from about 0.30 to about 1.00 dl. g.The dihydric phenols which may be employed to provide such aromtic carbonate polymers are mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic compounds, containing as functional groups two hydroxy radicals, each of which is attached directly to a carbon atom of an aromatic nucleus. Typical dihydric phenols are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A 2,4 dihydroxydiphenylmethane bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 propylphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethyl 3 methoxyphenyl methane 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyllethane 1,1 bis 4 hydroxy 2 ethylphenyl ethane 2,2 bis 3 phenyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexylmethane and 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l phenylpropane Bisphenols other than those having a carbon atom between the two phenols can also be employed. Examples of such groups of bisphenols include bis hydroxyphenyl sulfides, bis hydroxyphenyl ethers and bis hydroxyphenyl sulfoxides and the like. Other dihydric phenols which are also suitable for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,038,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. These aromatic polycarbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example and as mentioned above, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, in accordance with methods set forth in the above cited literature and U.S. Patent No. 4,018,750 and 4,123,436, or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. Branched polycarbonates are also useful, such as are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,001,184. Also there can be utilized blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonte. Moreover, blends of any of the above materials may be employed in the practice of this invention to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. In any event, the preferred aromatic carbonate polymer for use as component a i herein is a homopolymer derived from 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A . The copolyestercarbonate resins for use in the subject invention may generally be described as copolyesters comprising recurring carbonate groups, carboxylate groups,EMI6.1 EMI6.2 and aromatic carbocyclic groups in the linear polymer chain, in which at least some of the carboxylate groups and at least some of the carbonate groups are bonded directly to ring carbon atoms of the aromatic carbocyclic groups. These copolyestercarbonate copolymers, in general, are prepared by reacting a difunctional aromatic carboxylic acid, a dihydric phenol and a carbonate precursor. The dihydric phenols useful in formulating the copolyestercarbonates for use herein may be represented.by the general formula EMI7.1 in which A is an aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, naphthylene, anthrylene, etc. E may be an alkylene or alkylidene group such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, propylidene, isopropylidene, butylene, butylidene, isobutylidene, amylene, isoamylene, amylidene, isoamylidine, etc. Where E is an alkylene or alkylidene group, it may also consist of two or more alkylene or alkylidene groups, connected by a nonalkylene or nonalkylidene group such as an aromatic linkage, a tertiary amino linkage, an ether linkage, a carbonyl linkage, a silicon containing linkage, or by a sulfur containing linkage such as sulfide, sulfide, sulfone, etc.In addition, E may be a cycloaliphatic group e.g., cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl , a sulfurcontaining linkage, such as sulfide, sulfoxide or sulfone an ether linkage a carbonyl group a tertiary nitrogen group or a silicon containing linkage such as silane or siloxy. Other groups which E may represent will occur to those skilled in the art. R is hydrogen or d monovalent hydrocarbon group such as alkyl methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc. , aryl phenol, naphthyl, etc. , aralkyl benzyl, ethylphenyl, etc. or cyclo aliphatic cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, etc. . Y may be an inorganic atom such as chlorine, bromine, fluorine, etc. an inorganic group such as the nitro group, etc. an organic group such as R above, or an oxy group such as OR, it being only necessary that Y be inert to and unaffected by the reactants and the reaction conditions.The letter m is any whole number from and including zero through the number of positions on A available for substitution p is any whole number from and including zero through the number of available positions on E t is a whole number equal to at least one, S is either zero or one, and u is any whole number including zero. In the dihydric phenol compound represented byFormula II above, when more than one Y substituent is present, they may be the same or different. The same is true for the R substituent. Where s is zero inFormula II and u is not zero, the aromatic rings are directly joined with no intervening alkylene or other bridge. The positions of the hydroxyl groups and Y on the aromatic nuclear residues A can be varied in the ortho, meta, or para positions and the groupings can be in a vicinal, asymmetrical or symmetrical relationship, where two or more ring carbon atoms of the aromatic hydrocarbon residue are substituted with Y and hydroxyl group. Examples of dihydric phenol compounds that may be employed in this invention include the same as previously mentioned for use in aromatic polycarbonates. In general, any aromatic difunctional carboxylic acid or its reactive derivative such as the acid halide conventionally used in the preparation of polyesters may be used for the preparation of polyestercarbonates useful in formulating the compositions of the present invention. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as the aromatic diacid halides are preferred as they produce the aromatic polyestercarbonates which are most useful, from the standpoint of physical properties, in the practice of the instant invention. These carboxylic acids may be represented by theEMI9.1 tb general SEP form SEP ula tb SEP R2 SEP ç SEP R1 SEP SEP oOOH SEP III tb wherein Ra represents an aromatic radical such as phenylene, naphthylene, bisphenylene, substituted phenylene, etc. two or more aromatic groups connected through non aromatic linkages such as those defined byE in Formula II or a divalent aliphatic aromatic hydrocarbon radical such as an aralkyl or alkaryl radical. R2 is either a carboxyl or a hydroxyl group. The letter q represents the integer one whereR2 is a hydroxyl group and either zero or one whereR2 is a carboxyl group. Thus the difunctional carboxylic acid will either be a monohydroxy monocarboxylic acid or a dicarboxylic acid.For purposes of the present invention the aromatic dicarboxylic acids or their reactive derivatives such as, for example, the acid halides, are preferred. Thus in these preferred aromtic dicarboxylic acids, as represented by FormulaIII, R2 is a carboxyl group and R1 is an aromatic radical such as phenylene, biphenylene, napthylene, substituted phenylene, etc., two or more aromatic groups connected through nonaromatic linkages or a divalent aliphatic aromatic radical. Some nonlimiting examples of suitable preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acids which may be used in preparing the polyestercarbonate resins of the instant invention include phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, homophthalic acid, o , m , and p phenylenediacetic acid, the polynuclear aromatic acids such as diphenic acid, and 1,4 naphthalic acid. These acids may be used individually or as mixtures of two or more different acids. The carbonate precursor may be either a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester, or a haloformate. The carbonyl halides which can be employed herein are carbonyl chlorides and carbonyl bromide. Typical of the carbonate esters which may be employed herein are diphenyl carbonate, di halophenyl carbonates such as di chloro phenylicarbonate, di bromophenyl carbonate, di tri chlorophenyl carbonate, di tribromophenyl carbonate, etc., di alkylphenyl carbonates such as di tolyl carbonate, etc., di naphthyl carbonate, di chloronaph thyl carbonate, phenyltolyl carbonate, chloronaphthyl chlorophenyl carbonate, and the like.The haloformates suitable for use herein include bishaloformates of dihydric phenols such as bischloroformates of hydroquinone, etc. or glycols such as bis haloformates of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc. While other carbonate precursors will occur to those skilled in the art, carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene is preferred. The preparation of copolyestercarbonates which may be employed in the compositions of the present invention is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,030,331 3,169,121 3,207,814 4,194,038 and 4,156,069 and assigned to the same assignee as the instant application, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. A quite useful class of aromatic copolyestercarbonate is that derived from bisphenol A, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid, or the reactive derivatives of these acids such as terephthaloyl dichloride, isophthaloyl dichloride, or a mixture of isophthaloyl dichloride and terephthaloyl dichloride, and phosgene. As stated previously, there is a preponderance of carbonate bonds as opposed to ester bonds in the aromatic polycarbonte copolyestercarbonate admixture. The maximum percentage of carbonate bonds is that which allows significant retention of hydrolytic stability as measured in the S tensile impact test but which does not provide polycarbonate like impact behavior in the 6.4mm Notched Izod or double gate test systems.Generally, this does not go beyond about 90 mole percent carbonate bonds, preferably about 85 mole percent.The lower limit is generally about 55 or preferably about 60 mole percent carbonate bonds. With respect to the quantity of polyolefin employed in the composition, a hydrolytic stabilizing effective amount is employed. The precise quantity is dependent upon the specific composition of polycarbonate copolyestercarbonates employed. However, in general the range is from about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 weight percent. The weight percent of polyolefin is measured as weight percent of polycarbonate plus copolyestercarbonate. Below about 0.1 weight percent little hydrolytic stabilization is generally observed. Above about 5 weight percent, some decrease in other properties can occur. The compositions of the invention are prepared by standard blending operations. The mixing of these materials may be accomplished by a variety of methods normally employed for incorporation of plasticizers or fillers into thermoplastic polymers, including but not limited to, mixing rolls, dough mixers, Banbury mixers, extruders, and other mixing equipment. The resulting mixtures may be handled in any conventional manner employed for the fabrication or manipulation of thermoplastic resins. The materials may be formed or molded using compression, injection, calendering, extrusion and blow molding techniques, alone or in any combination. Also multiprocessing methods, such as extrusion blow molding or co extrusion co injection can be used, e.g., for multi layer containers. It should be understood that the resin mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention may also contain, in addition to the above mentioned polymers, other additives to lubricate, reinforce, prevent oxidation, or lend color to the material. Other additives, such as mold release agents, stabilizers, and flame retardants are well known in the art, and may be incorporated without departing from the scope of the invention The resistance to impact failure of the aromatic carbonate resin mixtures prepared in accordance with the subject invention was determined in accordance with the Notched Izod Impact Test, ASTM D256 on molded test specimens in the form of bars of two sizes 64mm x 12.8mm x 3.2mm and 64mm x 12.8mm x 6.4mm, the latter dimension being the specimen thickness. The test specimens were mounted in accordance with ASTM D256 procedures and were tested at room temperature. Izod impact strengths were determined for all specimens according to ASTM D256 procedures on notched specimens.The tensile impact strength of the polycarbonate resin mixtures prepared in accordance with the subject invention was determined in accordance with the TensileImpact Test, ASTM D 1822. In accordance with this test method a test specimen in the form of a thin strip or film is mounted between a pendulum head and crosshead clamp on the pendulum of an impact tester. The pendulum is released and carries the specimen and crosshead past a fixed anvil which halts the crosshead clamp. The pendulum head continues forward carrying the forward portion of the ruptured specimen. The energy loss tensile impact energy is recorded as well, whether the failure appears to be brittle or ductile type. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In order that those skilled in the art may better understand how the present invention may be practiced, the following Examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise noted. The various polycarbonate resin mixtures were extruded in aSterling extruder and molded in a 3 oz. Van Dorn injection molding machine, the processing temperatures for each operation were as indicated below. EXAMPLES 1 6 In the following examples, many of the compositions prepared included a copolyestercarbonate intrinsic viscosity I.V. of about 0.5 dl g as measured in methylene chloride at 300C., namely TEXAN0 3250, fromGeneral Electric Company. A substantially identical copolyestercarbonate resin for use herein may be prepared as follows To a reactor vessel is added 16 liters of methylene chloride, 8 liters of water, 1906 grams 8.36 moles of bisphenol A, 24 milliliters of triethylamine, 3.4 grams of sodium glyconate, and 65 grams of paratertiary butylphenol chain terminator.At a pH of between about 9 10.5, 1089.6 grams 5.3i moles of a mixture of 15 by weight of isophthaloyl dichloride and 85 by weight of terephthaloyl dichloride in 2 liters of methylene chloride is added over a 10 minute interval while controlling the pH at about 9 10.5 with 35 aqueous caustic. After the addition of the diacid chloride mixture, phosgene is added at a rate of 36 grams per minute for 12 minutes while controlling the pH at about 10 11 with 358 aqueous caustic. The polymer mixture is diluted with 2 liters of methylene chloride and the brine phase is separated. The resulting polymer phase is washed once with 0.1 HC1 and three times with water and is then recovered by high steam precipitation to yield a white powder.This copolyestercarbonate has molar ratios of dihydroxy diaryl units to benzene dicarboxylate units to carbonate units of about 1 0.64 0.36 and a molar ratio of terephthalate units to isophthalate units of about 8.5 1.5. The resin mixtures were prepared in the following manner An aromatic polycarbonate derived from 2,2 bis 4hydroxyphenyl propane and having an intrinsic viscosity I.V. in the range of from about 0.46 to about 0.49 dl g as determined in a methylene chloride solution at 250C. LEXANO 140, General Electric Company was mixed with a copolyestercarbonate tEXAN0 3250, GeneralElectric Company . The above components were tumbled in a laboratory tumbler until well mixed.One of each of the following low density polyolefin resin impact modifiers were added to the polycarbonate resin blends a Escoreneo tPX 1, a copolymer of ethylene and butene l having a density of 0.910, Exxon Corporation and b Escorenes tPX 12, a copolymer of ethylene and butene l having a density of 0.912, Exxon Corporation.The ingredients were then blended together by mechanically mixing them in a laboratory tumbler and the resulting mixture was fed to an extruder which was operated at about 2820C. The resulting extrudates were comminuted into pellets. The pellets were injection molded at about 2600C. into test specimens of about 64mm x 12.8mm x 3.2mm and 64mm x 12.8mm x 6.4mm, the latter dimension being specimen thickness. Where indicated, Izod impact strengths of these specimens were measured according to the Notched Izod test, ASTM D256.The weld line strength of the samples was measured with the specimens prepared in a double gate mold in the same way as the Notched Izod samples. When polymer melt was injected through the gates, a weld line was then formed in the center of the sample. Measurements were made according to ASTM D256. The numerical superscripts indicate the percent of test specimens which were ductile and the superscript R indicates that the sample failed in a hinged mode, which is an improvement over brittle failure. The S tensile impact was measured on 3 mil specimens according to the TensileImpact Test, ASTM D 1822. Some of the samples were icersed in a water bath at 820C. for a period of 14 days and Tensile Impact Test ASTM D 1822 was performed on the moisture exposed test specimens.The samples labeled control are bisphenol A polycarbonate copolyestercarbonate blends containing no polyolefin. Formulations A, 1 and 2 employed 20 weight percent polycarbonate and 80 weight percent copolyestercarbonate. Formulations B, 3 and 4 employed 45 weight percent polycarbonate and 55 weight percent copolyestercarbonate. Formulations C, 5 and 6 employed 60 weight percent polycarbonate and 40 weight percent copolyestercarbonate.

Since there is a preponderance of carbonate bonds, polycarbonate like behavior is generally expected and is not observed. Each of the above mentioned patents, applications and publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. Although the subject invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, many obvious modifications or changes may be made therein or will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. For example, instead of a bisphenol A polycarbonate, one containing units derived from tetramethylbisphenol A or from dixylenol sulfone can be used as component a i . Instead of a polyestercarbonate based on terephthalate and isophthalate units, naphthenate units may be substituted for either. Instead of a copolymer of ethylene and butene l, a copolymer of propylene and butene l or octene l could be used, to name but a few of the variations possible.All such modifications are within the scope and spirit of the subject invention as defined by the appended claims.
