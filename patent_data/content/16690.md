# Apparatus for separating solids from suspensions in a liquid influent.

## Abstract
The influent is first mixed in a mixing chamber 3 and then transferred to a settling chamber 7 through hydrody namic changing means able to reduce momentum transfer to the liquid in said settling chamber and thus increase the rate of sedimentation of the suspended solids. According to the invention, the hydrodynamic changing means comprise a perforated plate 5 which defines spaced flow paths 21 inclines with respect to the plate as well as relatively to each other so that the tangential velocity components of the flows of iiquid exiting same tend to cancel one another. For use particularly in waste treatment systems.
