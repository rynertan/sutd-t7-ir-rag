NONAQUEOUS CELL EMPLOYING A CATHODE ELECTROLYTE SOLUTION CONTAINING A ORON CONTAINING ADDITIVEField of the Invention The invention relates to a nonaqueous cell employing an active metal anode, such RS lithium, and 8 cathode electrolyte solution comprising a solute dissolved in a liquid active cathode.Background of the Art The development of high energy battery systems requires, among other things, the compatibility of an electrolyte solution possessing desirable electrochermical properties with respect to highly reactive anode materials, such as lithium or the like. The use of aqueous electrolytes is precluded in these systems since the anode materials are sufficiently active to react with water chemically. It has, therefore, been necessary in order to realize the high energy density obtainable through use of these highly reactive anodes to turn to the investigation of nonaqueous electrolyte systems. The term nonaqueous electrolyte as used herein refers to an electrolyte which is composed of a solute, such as, for example, a metal Balt or a complex salt of Group IA, Group IIA, Group IIIA orGroup VA elements of the Periodic Table, dissolved in an appropriate nonaqueous solvent. The term Periodic Table as used herein refers to thePeriodic Table of Elements as set forth on the inside front cover of the Handbook of Chemistry andPhysics, 63rd Edition, CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, Florida, 1982 1983. A multitude of solutes is known and many have been suggested for use but the selection of a suitable solvent has been particularly troubles m . The ideal battery electrolyte would comprise a solvent solute pair which has a long liquid range, high ionic conductivity and stability. A. long range, i.e., high boiling point and low freezing point, is essential if the battery is to operate at other than normal ambient temperatures. High ionic conductivity is necessary if the battery is to have high rate capability. Stability is necessary with the electrode materials, the materials of cell construction, and the products of the cell reaction to provide long shelf life when used in a primary or secondary battery system.

US A 4,400,453 discloses a nonaqueous electrochemical cell comprising an anode, a cathode collector and A cathode electrolyte, said cathode electrolyte comprising 8 solutioh of an ionically conductive solute dissolved in.an ctiye cathode depolarizer wherein said active cathode depolarizer consists of a liquid oxyhalide of an element of Group V or Group VI of the PeriodicTable.Although oxyhalides can be used effectively Ã…as a component part of a cathode electrolyte in conjunction with an active metal anode, such as a lithium anode, to produce a good high energy density cell, it has been observed that if the cell is stored for a period of about three days or longer, excessive passivation of the anode appears to occur which results in undesirable voltage delays at the beginning of discharge along with high cell impedance. US A 3,993,501 discloses one approach for minimizing or preventing undesirable voltage delays at the beginning of discharge of nonaqueous cells employing an oxyhalide containing cathode electrolyte by providing a vinyl polymer film coating on the surface of the anode that contacts the cathode electrolyte.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an oxyhalide cathode electrolyte cell system employing an active metal anode, such as lithium, with a boron containing compound additive and a vinyl polymer additive to effectively prevent the txcessive passivati on of the active metal anode during cell storage and usage. The foregoing and additional objects will become more fully apparent from the following description.Summary of the Invention The invention relates to a nonaqbeous cell employing an active anode and a cathode electrolyte solution, said cathode electrolyte solution comprising a solute dissolved in a liquid active cathode, the improvement wherein the cathodeelectrolyte solution contains at least one additive selected from the group consisting of compounds of boron with elements from Periodic Group VIA andVIIA, and lithium boron compounds, in an amount sufficient to alleviate initial voltage delay of the cell when discharged. The preferred amount of the boron containing additive of this invention would be between about 0.01 mole and about 1,5 moles per liter of the cathode electrolyte solution. More preferably, the amount of the additive would be between about 0.1 mole and about 1.0 mole and most preferably about 0.75 mole per liter of the cathode electrolyte solution. An amount below 0.01 mole per liter of the cathode electrolyte of the additive would be ineffective for most applications. An amount above 1.5 moles per liter of the cathode electrolyte of the additive would reduce the amount of active material that would be placed in a fixed volume container. Suitable boron compounds for use in this invention are compounds of boron with elements fromPeriodic Group VIA and VIlA such as By13, BBr3,B2S3 and B203, and lithium boron compounds such as LiB02, Li2B4O7, LiB2 and LiB12. It has been discovered that certain active tathode materials , such as the liquid oxyhalides, do not appreciably react chemically with an active anode metal at the interface between the metal and the cathode material, thereby allowing the cathode material to contact the anode directly and act as the electrolyte carrier. While the theory behind the cause of the inhibition of direct chemical reaction is not fully understood at the present time and the applicant does not desire to be limited to any theory of invention, it appears that direct chemical reaction is inhibited either by an inherently high activation energy of reaction or the formation of a thin, protective film on the anode surface. Any protective film on the anode surface must not be formed to such an excess that a large incresse in anode polarization results. Although the active reducible liquid cathodes, such as the oxyhalides, inhibit the direct reaction of active metal anode surfaces sufficiently to permit them to act as both the cathode material and as the electrolyte solvent for nonaqueous cells, they do cause formation of a surface film on the active metal anode during cell storage, particularly at elevated temperatures, which consists of a rather heavy layer of crystalline materisl. This crystalline layer appears to cause excessive passivation of the anode which results in voltage delay on initial discharge. The extent of anode passivation can be measured by observing the time required for the closed circuit voltage of the stored cell to reach its intended voi age level after discharge has begun. If this delay exceeds 20 seconds, the anode passivation would be considered excessive for most applications. What has been observed, for example, in lithiumsoxyhalide cell systems is that after a load is applied across the terminals of the cell, the cell voltage immediately drops below the intended discharge level, then increases at a rate depending on temperature, the thickness of the crystalline layer, and the current density. The exact composition of this layer is not known. The thickness and density of the crystalline layer as well as the size and shape of the crystals were observed to vary with the length of the storage period and also with the temperature during storage, e.g., at low temperatures there is relatively little growth of the crystalline layer as compared to the greater growth of the layer at higher temperatures of about 710C. US A 4,277,545 discloses that the initial voltage delay observed in lithium oxyhalide cells can be reduced by dissolving a vinyl polymer in the liquid oxyhalide. It has been observed that with the addition of a vinyl polymer to a cell up to 1.0 gram per liter of the cathode electrolyte, the initial voltage delay time.of the cell which had been stored at about 210C for one month, was reduced as compared to an identical cell that did not contain the vinyl polymer. Increasing the vinyl polymer above 1.0 gram per liter would not further reduce the initial voltage delay and instead would sacrifice cell capacity by occupying volume that could be used for the active materials of the cell.An amount of vinyl polymer below 0.05 gram per liter of the cathode electrolyte would not effectively reduce the initial delay voltage. It has been discovered that by adding a boron containing additive of the subject invention and a vinyl polymer to a lithium oxyhalide cell, a synergistic effect was observed in the reduction of initial voltage delay after the cell was stored at an elevated temperature. The vinyl polymer to be used in this invention must remain stable in the liquid cathode electrolyte and not effectively decrease the capacity of the Cell during cell storage and discharge and in most cases will even increase the cell output on high rate discharge compared to cells without the vinyl polymer. The vinyl polymer can be added to the cell by applying a vinyl coating on the separator and or anode and or by dissolving the vinyl polymer in the cathode electrolyte solution. The vinyl polymeric materials suitable for use in accordance with this invention are normally solid vinyl polymers such as homopolymers of vinyl or vinylidene chloride, or copolymers containing vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride having at least one of the following monomers copolymerized therein selected from the group consisting of vinyl esters, dibasic acids, diesters of dibasic acids and monoesters of dibasic acids. The term copolymers is used herein to mean mixed polymers or polyblends as well as heteropolymers formed from two or more unlike monomers polymerized together reference Concise Chemical and Technical Dictionary, 3rdEdition, H. Bennett, editor, Chemical PublishingCo., 1974 . General examples of suitable copolymers include combinations of vinyl chloride copolymerized with vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and the like vinyl chloride copolymerized with diesters of dibasic acids such as dibutyl maleate vinyl chloride copolymerized with vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate and dibasic acids or mono or diesters of dibasic acids such as maleic acid, or dibutyl or monobutyl maleate, Specific examples are a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer containing 975 vinyl chloride 3S vinyl acetate a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer containing 862 vinyl chloride 145 vinyl acetate a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate dibasic acid copolymer containing 86S vinyl chloride 135 vinyl acetate 1 maleic acid and a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymer containing 90 vinyl chloride 105 vinyl acetate. The preferred amount of the vinyl polymer would be at least 0.05 gram per liter of the cathode electrolyte solution. More preferably, the amount of the vinyl polymer would be at least 0.075 gram per liter of the cathode electrolyte solution and most preferably at least 0.25 gram per liter of the cathode electrolyte solution. Suitable nonaqueous liquid cathode materials for use in cells employing this invention would include sulfuryl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl bromide, chromyl chloride, vanadyl trlbromide, selenium oxychloride, sulfur monochloride, sulfur monobromide, selenium tetrafluorlde, selenium monobromide, thlophosphoryl chloride, thiophosphoryl bromide, vanadium pentafluoride, lead tetrachloride, titanium tetrachloride, disulfur decafluoride, tin bromide trichloride, tin dibromide dichloride, tin tribromide chloride and mixtures thereof. If desired, and specifically for the halides, a cosolvent should be added to the liquid active reducible cathode and solute solution to alter the dielectric constant, viscosity or solvent properties of the solution to achieve better conductivity. Some examples of suitable cosolvents are tetrahydrofuran, 1, 3 dioxolane, 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone, propylene carbonate, gsmma butyrolactone, sulfolane, ethylene glycol sulfate, dimethyl sulfite, benzoyl chloride, dimethoxyethane, dimethyl isoxazole, diethyl carbonate, sulfur dioxide and the like. It is also within this invention to employ inorganic solvents such as liquid inorganic halides of elements from Groups IV, V and VI of the PeriodicTable, e.g., selenium tetrafluoride SeF4 , selenium monobromide Se2Br2 , thiophosphoryl chloride PSC13 , thiophosphoryl bromide PSBr3 , vanadium pentafluoride VF5 , lead tetrachloride PbCl4 , titanium tetrachloride TiC14 , disulfur decafluoride S2Flo , tin bromide trichloride SnBrCl3 , tin dibromide dichloride SnBr2C12 , tin tribromide chloride SnBr3Cl , sulfur monochloride S2C12 , and sulfur dichloride SCl2 .These halides, in addition to functioning as an electrolyte solvent in nonaqueous cells, can also function as an active reducible cathode thereby contributing to the overall active reducible material in such cells. The anode for use in the cells of this invention can be generally consumable metals and include the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and alloys of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals with each other and other metals. The term alloy as used herein is. intended to include mixtures solid solutions such as lithium magnesium and intermetallic compounds such as lithium monoaluminide. The preferred anode materials are the alkali metals and particularly lithium, sodium and potassium. When using lithium snodes the anode may be coated with a vinyl resin as disclosed in US A 3,993,501, said patent incorporated herein by reference. A separator if used in this invention has to be chemically inert and insoluble in the liquid cathode electrolyte and have a porosity so as to permit the liquid electrolyte to permeate through and contact the anode of the cell, thus establishing an ion transfer path between the anode and cathode.A suitable separator for use in this invention is nonwoven or woven glass fiber mat as disclosed inUS A 4,421,834. However, the vinyl polymer could be incorporated into or onto the separator, if desired. The solute for use in the cells suitable for this invention may be simple or double salt which will produce an ionically conductive solution when dissolved in a suitable solvent. Preferred so lutes for nonaqueous systems are complexes of inorganic or organic Lewis acids and inorganic ionizable salts. The only requirements for utility are that the salt, whether simple or complex, be compatible with the solvent being employed and that it yield a solution which is ionically conductive. According to the Lewis or electronic concept of acids and bases, many substances which contain no active hydrogen can act as acids or acceptors of electron doublets. The basic concept is set forth in the chemical literature Journal of the FranklinInstitute, Vol. 226, July December, 1938, pages 293 313 by G. N. Lewis . The cathode collector for use in cells suitable for this invention has to be electronically conductive 80 as to permit external electrical contact to be made with the active cathode material and also provide extended area reaction sites for the cathode electrochemical process of the cell.Materials suitable for use as a cathode collector are carbon materials and metals, such as nickel, with acetylene black being preferable. In addition, the cathode collector when made of particulate material should be capable of being molded directly within 8 can or capable of being molded into various size discrete bodies that can be handled without cracking or breaking. To impart a cohesive characteristic to some types of cathode collectors, such as carbonaceous cathode collectors, a suitable binder material, with or without plasticizers and with or without stabilizers. can be added to the cathode collector materials. Suitable binder materials for this purpose may include vinyl polymers, acrylic polymers and the like. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene would be the preferred binder for cathode collectors for use with liquid oxyhalide cathodes.The binder, if required, should be added in an amount between about 55 and about 305 by weight of the molded cathode collector since an amount less than 55 would not provide sufficient strength to the molded body while an amount larger than 305 would wet proof the surface of the carbon and or reduce the available surface of the carbon, thereby reducing the activation site areas required for the cathodic electrochemical process of the cell. Preferably, the binder should be between 105 and 255 by weight of the cathode collector. Of importance in selecting the materials for the cathode collector is to select materials that will be chemically stable in the cell system in which they are to be used. The container of the battery could be made of stainless steel, iron, nickel, plastic, coated metals or some other suitable material. Some preferred combinations of nonaqueous cathode materials and anodes would be as follows 1 sulfuryl chloride Li or Na . 2 thionyl chloride Li or Na 3 phosphorus oxychloride Li or Na 4 sulfur monochloride Li or Na sulfur monobromide Li or Na 6 selenium tetrafluoride Li or Na. Preferably, the cells for use in this invention would be liquid oxyhalide cells using sulfuryl chloride, thionyl chloride or mixtures thereof with a lithium anode.Brief Description of the Drawings The present invention will become more apparent from the following description thereof when considered together with the accompanying drawings. Figures 1 through 8 show discharge voltage vs time curves for nonaqueous lithium thionyl chloride cells with or without a boron halide or boron sulfide compound and or a vinyl polymer addi tive to the cell. Example 1 12 mm A plurality or cell lots comprising 0.475 inch inch diameter by 1.64 inch high cells was produced each containing a lithium anode about 1.3 amperehours a porous carbon current collector, 8 nonwoven glass separator disposed between the anode and the cathode collector, and a cathode electrolyte comprising 2.4 ml of l.5M LiAlCi4 in SOCl2. The SOC12 cathode capacity was about 1.53 ampere hours thereby making the cell anode limited. In some cell lots, BCl3 was dissolved in the cathode electrolyte in various amounts.In other cell lots, a vinyl polymer comprising polyvinyl chloride was dissolved in the cathode electrolyie in various amounts In other cell lots, both BC13 and the vinyl polymer were added to the cathode electrolyte in various amounts. After sealing, the cells were then stored at about 210C or 710C for either two weeks or four weeks and then each cell was discharged atross a 75 ohm load. The discharge voltage data were observed for each cell. Table 1 shows the various cell lots along with the amount of any additive incorporated in the cathode electrolyte. Each lot consisted of three cells. The discharge voltage vs time curve for each cell in each lot was plotted and the data for lots 1 through 6 are shown plotted inFigures 1 through 6, respectively.

In two cells from lot 2, the voltage after 35 seconds was only between 1.5 Ond 1.6 volts which was substantially lower than the lowest performing cell in lot 4 which was 2.2 volts after 35 seconds. Cells of the same system containing 1M BCl3 and 0.25 g t of the vinyl polymer displayed voltages of 2.8 to 3.0 volts within 4 seconds under the same test conditions. Figures 7 and 8 show that the additiveB2S3 reduced the voltage of cells after being stored at 210C for four weeks compared to identical cells but not containing B2S3 and which were also stored for four weeks at 2l0C.
