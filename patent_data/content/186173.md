## Description
L AMINODICARBOXYLIC 0 CYCLOALKYL L AMINOCARBOXYLATE ALKYL ESTERS, AN EDIBLE COMPOSITION CONTAINING SAME AS SWEETENERS AND A METHOD FOR SWEETENING All EDIBLE COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel group of compounds and more particular to a novel group of compounds particularly well suited as sweeteners in edible foodstuff.DESCRIPTION OF TE PRIOR ART Sweetness is one of the primary taste cravings cf both animals and humans. Thus, the utilization of sweetening agents in foods in order to satisfy this sensory desire is well established. Naturally occurring carbohydrate sweeteners such as sucrose, are still the most widely used sweetening agents. While these naturally occu ring carbohydrates, i.e., sugars, generally fulfill the reqvirements of sweet taste, the abundant usage thereof does not cccur withoutdeleterious consequence, e.g., high caloric intake and nutritional imbalance. In fact, oftentimes the level of these sweeteners required in foodstuffs is far greater than the level of the sweetener that is desired for economic, dietetic or other functional consideration. In an attempt to eliminate the disadvantages concomitant with natural sweeteners, considerable research and expense have been devoted to the production of artificial sweeteners, such as for example, saccharin, cyclamate, dihydrochalcone, aspartame, etc. While some of these artificial sweeteners satisfy the requirements of sweet taste without caloric input, and have met with considerable commercial success, they are not, however, without their own inherent disadvantages. For example, many of these artificial sweeteners have the disadvantages of high cost, as well as delay in the perception of the sweet taste, persistent lingering of the sweet taste, and a very objectionable bitter, metallic aftertaste when used in food products. Since it is believed that many disadvantages of artificial sweeteners, particularly aftertaste, is a function of the concentration of the sweetener, it has been previously suggested that these effects could be reduced or eliminated by combining artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, with Other ingredients such as aspartame or natural sugars, such as sorbitol, dextrose, maltose etc. These combined products, however, have not been entirely satisfactory either. Some U.S. Patents which disclose sweetener mixtures include for example, U.S. PatentNo. 4,228,198 U.S. Patent No. 4,158,068 U.S.Patent No. 4,154,862 and U.S. Patent No. 3,717,477 Accordingly, much work has continued in an attempt to develop and identify compounds that have a sweet taste and which will satisfy the need for better lower calorie sweeteners. Search continues for sweeteners that have intense sweetness, that is, deliver a sweet taste at low use levels and which will also produce enough sweetness at low levels to act as sole sweetener in all or most sweetener applications. Furthermore, the sweeteners sought must have good temporal and sensory qualities.Sweeteners with good temporal qualities produce a time intensity sweetness responses similar to natural sweeteners without lingering. Sweeteners with good sensory qualities lack undesirable off tastes and aftertaste. Fu thermorb, these compounds must be econoical and safe to use. In U.S. Patent No. 3,798,204 L aspartyl O t butyl L serine methyl ester and L aspartyl 0 t amylL serine methyl ester are described as sweet compounds having significant sweetness. In U.S. Patent No.4,448,716 metal complex salts of dipeptide sweetners are disclosed. In the background of this patent a generic formula is described as an attempt to represent dipeptide sweeteners disclosed in five prior patents U.S. PatentNo. 3,475,403 U.S. Patent No. 3,492,131 Republic of South Africa Patent No. 695,083 published July 10, 1969 Republic of South Africa Patent No. 695,910 published August 14, 1969 and German PatentNo. 2,054,554. The general formula attempting to represent these patents is as follows EMI3.1 Wherein R represents the lower alkyls, lower alkyaryls and cycloalkyls, n stands for integers 0 through 5, R1 represents a phenyl group, b lower alkyls, c cyclo alkyls, d R2. Where R2 is hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl, halogen, e S O m lower alkyl where m is 0, 1 or 2 and provided n is 1 or 2, f R3. Inhere R3 represents an hydroxy or alkoxy and g single or double unsaturated cycloalkyls with up to eight carbons. These compounds also are not entirely satisfacory in producing a high quality sweetness or in producing a sweet response at low levels of sweetener. Dipeptides of aspartyl cysteine and aspartylmethionine methyl esters are disclosed by Erussel, Peer and Van der Heijden in Chemical Senses and Flavour, 4, 141 152 1979 and in Z. Lebensm. Untersuch Forsch., 159, 337 343 1975 . The authors disclose the following dipeptides alpha L Asp L Cys Me OMe alpha L Asp L Cys Et OMe alpha L Asp L Cys Pr OMe alpha L Asp L Cys i Pr OMe alpha L Asp L Cyst t But OMe alpha L ASp L Met OMe European Patent Application 34,876 describes amides of L aspartyl D amino acid dipeptides of the formula EMI4.1 wherein Ra is methyl, ethyl, n propyl or isopropyl andR is a branched aliphatic, alicylic or heterocyclic member which is branched at the alpha carbon atom and also branched again at one or both of the beta carbon atoms. These compounds are indicated to be of significant sweetness. Despite the past efforts in this area, research continues.Accordingly, it is desired to find compounds that provide quality sweetness when added to foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals at low levels and thus eliminate or greatly diminish disadvantages associated with prior art sweeteners.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present new compounds are dipeptides of certain aminodicarboxylic acids and etherified hydroxy c amino mono carboxylic acid esters which are low calorie sweeteners that possess a high order of sweetness with pleasing taste and little, if any, aftertaste. This invention provides new sweetening compounds represented by the formula EMI5.1 wherein R is alkyl containing 1 3 carbon atoms R1 is cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, lower alkyl substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl, bicycloalkyl, bicycloalkenyl or tricycloalkyl containing up to 10 ring carbon atoms and up to a total of 12 carbon atoms or cyclic ether or cyclic thioether containing up to 10 ring carbon atoms and up to a total of 12 carbon atoms R2 and R4 are each H or alkyl containing 1 3 carbon atoms . R3 is H, alkyl containing 1 6 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl containing 3 5 ring carbons n 0, 1 or 2 and m 0 or 1 and food acceptable salts thereof. Compounds of the above formula have a surprisingly high order of sweetness and pleasant taste with little or no aftertaste and are particularly suitable for lower calorie sweetening of foods and pharmaceuticals. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention, the preferred novel compounds of the invention are represented by the formula EMI6.1 wherein m, each n, R1, R2 R4 and Z have the same meaning as in formula I. Especially preferred compounds are of the formula EMI6.2 wherein n 0 or 1 R1, R3 and R4 are as previously defined.These compounds are readily preparable and show the highest levels of sweetness. The alpha aminodicarboxylic acids of the present new dipeptides are aspartic acid and aminomalonic acid, of which aspartic acid is preferred. The etherified hydroxy alpha aminomonocarboxylic acids are etherified serine and threonine and homologs thereof such as beta hydroxy alpha aminovaleric acid, gamma hydroxy alpha amino butyric acid, beta hydroxy alpha amino butyric acid and similar such amino acids and lower alkyl esters. The ether group in these acids is a cyclic hydrocarbyl group which is directly attached to the ether oxygen or separated by an alkylene chain from the ether oxygen. In accordance with present experience in taste testing of these sweeteners, the preferred compounds are those in which the aminodicarboxylic acids groups is o aspartyl and the hydroxy amino acid ester is serine or threonine methyl ester of these, serine methyl ester is preferred.

These novel compounds are effective sweetness agents when used alone or in combination with other sweeteners in an ingesta, e.g., foodstuffs or pharmaceuticals. For example, other natural and or artificial sweeteners which may be used with the novel compounds of the present invention include sucrose, fructose, corn syrup solids, dextrose, xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol, acetosulfam, thaumatin, invert sugar, saccharin, thiophene saccharin, meta aminobenzoic acid, meta hydroxybenzoic acid, cyclamate, chlorosucrose, dihydrochalcone, hydrogenated glucose syrups, aspartame L aspartyl L phenylalanine methyl ester and other dipeptides, glycyrrhizin and stevioside and the like. These sweeteners when employed with the sweetness agents of the prevent invention, it is believed, could produce synergistic sweetness responses. Furthermore, when the sweetness agents of the present invention are added to ingesta, the sweetness agents may be added alone or with nontoxic carriers such as the abovementioned sweeteners or other food ingredients such as acidulants and natural and artificial gums. Typical foodstuffs, and pharmaceutical preparations, in which the sweetness agents of the present invention may be used are, for example, beverages including soft drinks, carbonated beverages, ready to mix beverages and the like, infused foods e.g. vegetables or fruits , sauces, condiments, salad dressings, juices, syrups, desserts, including puddings, gelatin and frozen desserts, like ice creams, sherbets, icings and flavored frozen desserts on sticks, confections, toothpaste, mouthwash, chewing gum, cereals, baked goods, intermediate moisture foods e.g. dog food and the like. In order to achieve the effects of the present invention, the compounds described herein are generally added to the food product at a level which is effective to perceive sweetness in the food stuff and suitably is in an amount in the range of from about 0.0005 to 2 by weight based on the consumed product. Greater amounts are operable but not practical. Preferred amounts are in the range of from about 0.001 to about 1 of the foodstuff.Generally, the sweetening effect provided by the present compounds are experienced over a wide pH range, e.g. 2 to 10 preferably 3 to 7 and in buffered and unbuffered formulations. It is desired that when the sweetness agents of this invention are employed alone or in combination with another sweetener, the sweetener or combination of sweeteners provide a sucrose equivalent in the range of from about 2 weight percent to about 40 weight percent and more preferably from about 3 weight percent to about 15 weight percent in the foodstuff or pharmaceutical. A taste procedure for determination of sweetness merely involves the determination. of sucrose equivalency. Sucrose equivalence for sweeteners are readily determined. The amount of a sweetener that is equivalent to a given weight percent sucrose can be determined by having a panel of tasters taste solutions of a sweetener at known concentrations and match its sweetness to standard solutions of sucrose. In order to prepare compounds of the present invention serveral reaction schemes may be employed.In one reaction scheme compounds of the general formulas II protected CX7 aminodicarboxylic acid andIII etherified hydroxy aminoacid alkyl ester arecondensed to form compounds of the general formula IV protected L aminodicarboxyl O cycloalkyl L hydroxyaminoacid alkyl ester . Subsequent removal of protecting groups A and B from compounds of general formula IV give the desired compounds of general formula I. EMI19.1 In these, group A is an amino protecting group, B is a carboxyl protecting group and R, R1, R2, R3, R4, m and n have the same meaning as previously described. A variety of protecting groups known in the art may be employed. Examples of many of these possible groups may be found in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by T.W. Green, John Wiley and Sons, 1981. Among the preferred groups that may be employed.are benzyloxycarbonyl for A and benzyl for B. Coupling of compounds with general formula II to compounds having general formula III employs established techniques in peptide chemistry. One such technique uses dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC as the coupling agent. The DCC method may be employed wlth or without additives such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or copper II . The DCC coupling reaction generally proceeds at room temperature, however, it may be carried out from about 200 to 50 C, in a variety of solvents inert to the reactants.Thus suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, N,N dimethyl formamide, methylene chloride, toluene and the like. Preferably the reaction is carried out under an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen. Coupling usually is complete within 2 hours but may take as long as 24 hours depending on reactants Various other methods can be employed to prepare the desired compounds. The following illustrates such methods using aspartic acid Åas the amino dicarboxylic acid and serine as the amino monocarboxylic acid.Of course, other amino di and monocarboxylic acids can be substituted for these exemplary acids. For example, U.S. Patents 3off786039 3,833,553 3,879,372 and 3,933,781 disclose the reaction ofN protected aspartic anhydrides with amino acids and amino acid derivatives to yield the desired products. These N protected aspartic anhydrides can be reacted witn compounds of formula III by methods disclosed in the above patents.As described in U.S. Patent 3,786,039 compounds of formula III can be reacted directly in inert organic solvents with L aspartic anhydride having its amino group protected by a formyl, carbobenzloxy, or p methoxycarbobenzloxy group which is subsequently removed after coupling to give compounds of general formula I. The N acyl L aspartic anhydrides are prepared by reacting the corresponding acids with acetic anhydride in amounts of 1.0 1.2 moles per mole of the N acyl L aspartic acid at 0 to 6O0C in an inert solvent. The N acyl L aspartic anhydrides are reacted with preferably 1 to 2 moles of compounds of formula III in an organic solvent capable of dissolving both and inert to the same.Suitable solvents are, but not limited to, ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl ether, N,N dimethylformamide and benzene. The reaction proceeds smoothly at 0 to 3O0C. TheN acyl group is removed after coupling by catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon or with HBr or HC1 in a conventional manner. U.S. PatentNo. 3,879,372 di scloses that this coupling method can also be performed in an aqueous solvent at a temperature of 100 to 500C and at a pH of 4 12. Another method for the synthesis of the desired compounds is the reaction of compounds of formula III with suitable aspartic acid derivatives in which protecting groups have been attached to the amino and beta carboxy groups and the alpha carboxy group has been converted to a reactive ester function. As disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,475,403 these coupled products may be deprotected as described to yield the desired compounds of formula I. An alternative scheme to the desired coupled compounds involves reaction of compounds of formula III with L aspartic acid N thiocarboxyanhy d ide by the method of Vinick and Jung, Tet. Lett., 23, 1315 18 1982 . An additional coupling method is described by T. Miyazawa, Text, Lett., 25, 771 1984 . Compounds of general formula III may be synthesized from N protected serine methyl ester by employed ing a variety of etherification methods known in the art. Some of these methods may be found in ModernSynthetic Reactions , 2nd ed., by H.O. House,W.A. Benjamin Inc., 1972 Advanced OrganicChemistry, 2nd ed., by J. March, McGraw Hill, 1977, and Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods, Vol. 1 and 2, by I.T. Harrison S. Harrison, WileyInterscience, 1971 1974. One possible etherification method is the acid catalyzed reaction of N protected serine methyl ester with an appropriate olefinic precursor of the desired R1 moiety. For example, when N carobenzyloxy L serine is reacted with methylene cxclopentane the N protected intermediate of general formula III where R1 represents l methyl cyclopentane is obtained. This intermediateIs then deprotected to give a compound of formula III having R1 equal to l methyl cyclopentane. when cyclo alkadienes are used, the product is a cycloalkenyl ether.As illustrative examples, the following R1 olefinic precursors can be utilized to give the corresponding saturated R1 group R1 Precursor R1 Group methylenecyclobutane 1 methylcyclobutyl 1 methyl 1 cyclobutene 1 methylcyclobutyl 1 methylcyclopentene 1 methylcyclopentyl 1 methylcyclohexene 1 methylcyclohexyl methylenecyclohexane 1 methylcyclohexyl 1, 2 dimethyl 1 cyclohexene 1, 2 dimethylcyclohexyl 1 methyl 1 cycloheptene 1 methylcycloheptyl 1 ethyl 1 cyclohexene l ethylcyclohexyl 1 ethyl 1 cyclopentene 1 ethylcyclopentyl 1, 3 cyclopentadiene 2 cyclopentenyl 1 methyl 1, 4 cyclohexadiene 1 methyl 1 cyclohex 3 enyl d limonene 1, 1 dimethyl 1 4 methylcyclohex 3 enyl methyl The reaction of an appropriate olefinic R1 enyl methyl precursor with N protected serine methyl ester is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst. Any acid is employable but a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid is advantageous. Usually an excess of from 1.2 to 50 moles of the olefin precursor is utilized. Reaction temperatures are in the range of 10 to 400C. and reaction times range from 2 to 48 hours. The reaction is carried out in a solvent that will dissolve both reactants and is inert to both as well. Solvents include, but are not limited to, methylene chloride, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform and the like. Usually an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon is supplied. Another possible etherification method is the base, or other catalyst, promoted reaction ofN protected serine methyl ester with an R1X, where X is an organic leaving group such as halide, tosylate or mesylate. Any base normally employed to deprotonate an alcohol may be used, such as sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, triethylamine, or diisopropyl ethylamine. Reaction temperatures are in the range of 780 to 1000C and reaction times vary from 2 to 48 hours. The reaction is carried out in a solvent that will dissolve both reactants and is inert to both as well. Solvents include, but are not limited to, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and the like. Usually an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon is supplied. Alternatively, a neutral catalyst such as mercury II salts or nickel II 2,4 pentanedionate may be employed in this reaction. These reactions are also carried out in inert solvents at room temperature or above. The intermediate formed in this reaction is deprotected to yield compounds of formula III. A third method is the solvomercuration demercuration reaction of the appropriate olefinic precursor of R1 with N prbtected serine methyl ester. The reaction of the olefin with N protected serine methyl ester in the presence of mercuric acetate or mercury trifluoroacetate is carried out at a reaction temperature of 10 to 100C in a solvent which will dissolve both reactants and is inert to both.Solvents include, but are not limited to, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, and the like. Reaction times vary from 5 minutes to 24 hours.The resulting organomercury intermediate is reduced in situ with basic aqueous sodium borohydride, or other reducing agents, to remove the mercury, followed by deprotection to yield compounds of general formula III. A fourth method of etherification is the reaction of N protected beta X L alanine methyl ester, whereX is halide, tosylate, mesylate or other leaving group, with R1OH using a base or other catalyst.Any base normally employed to deprotonate an alcohol may be used, including sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide, triethylamine, or diisopropyl ethylamine. The reaction may be run either with or without additives, for example, copper salts. Reaction temperatures are in the range of 780C to 100 C, and reaction times vary from 2 to 48 hours. The reaction is carried out in a solvent that will dissolve both reactants and is inert to both. Solvents include, but are not limited to, diethyl ether, tetrahydro furan, N, N dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and the like. Usually an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon is supplied. Alternatively, a neutral catalyst such as mercury salts or nickel II 2,4 pentanedionate may be employed in this reaction. These are also carried out in inert solvents at room temperature or above. This product is then deprotected to yield compounds of general formula III. To prepare compounds in which R2 and R3 are alkyl, the starting compound should have a corresponding side chain with a double bond within the corresponding side chain, as exemplified by limonene, in which the side chain is CH3 iH CH2, in which case 1,2 addition occurs on the side chain and does not involve ring carbon atoms. with regard to the removal of protecting groups from compounds of formula IV and protected precursors of formula III, a refer of deprotecting techniques are known in the art and can be utilized to advantage dependig on the nature of the protect ing groups. Among such techniques is catalytic hydrogenation utilizing palladium on carbon or transfer hydrogenation with 1, 4 cyclohexadiene.Generally the reaction is carried at room temperature but may be conducted from S to 650 C. Usually the reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent which may include, but are not lirrited to water, methanol, ethanol, dioxane, tetrahydofuran, acetic acid, t butyl alcohol, isopropanol or mixtures thereof. The reaction is usually run at a positive hydrogen pressure of 50 psi but can be conducted over the range of 20 to 250 psi. Reactions are generally quantitative taking 1 to 24 hours for completion. . In any of the previous synthetic methods the desired products are preferably recovered from reaction mixtures by crystallization. Alternatively, normal or reverse phase chromatography may be utilized as well as liquid liquid extraction or other means. The desired compounds of formula I are usually obtained in the free acid form they may also be recovered as their physiologically acceptable salts, i.e., the corresponding amino salts such as hydrochloride, sulfate, hydrosulfate, nitrate, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, phosphate or hydrophosphate or the alkali metal salts such as the sodium, potassium, lithium, or the alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium or magnesium, as well as aluminum, zinc and like salts. Conversion of the free peptide derivatives of formula I into their physiologically acceptable salts is carried out by conventional means, as for example, bringing the compounds of formula I into contact with a mineral acid, an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkali metel.oxide br carbonate or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, oxide, carbonate or other complexed form. These physiologically acceptable salts can also be utilized as sweetness agents usually having increased solubility and stability over their free forms.
