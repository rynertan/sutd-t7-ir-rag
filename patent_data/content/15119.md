# Jogging and running athletic sock.

## Abstract
An athletic sock, particularly suitable for jogging and running, is provided with terry loop shock absorber cushions in the heel and ball areas 11,15 for protecting and cushioning the heel and ball areas of the foot of the wearer. Relatively lesser terry loop density is provided in the arch area 16 to reduce the shock normally imparted to the arch of the foot of the wearer so that normal articulation of the bones in the foot takes place when the wearer is jogging and running. The shock absorber cushions are formed by providing a greater density of terry loops in the heel and ball areas 11,15 of the sock than the density of terry loops in the arch area 16 to enhance the cushioning provided in the heel and ball areas 11,15 .
