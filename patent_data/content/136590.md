# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a magnetic recording medium where in a magnetic powder is uniformly dispersed in a curable substance of a binder resin material comprising a vinyl chloride vinyl acetate series resin and or a polyurethane series resin, at least one of which having a B value in a following apparent viscosity equation log ηa Bx log η wherein ηa is an apparent viscosity cP at a temperature of 25 C, x is a resin concentration wt , η is a limiting viscosity cP at a temperature of 25 C and B is a constant, of 10 or less, which is measured by dissolving the resin in a mixed solvent of equal weights of methyl ethyl ketone, toluene and cyclohexanone and the B value of the mixed binder resin being 11 or less. The magnetic recording medium of the present inven tion is the high density recording medium having the great rectangular ratio and excellent in the noise properties.
