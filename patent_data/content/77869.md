# Toothbrush with two settling forms for the head adjustment to the different conditions of employ on the side and front parts of the dental arches.

## Abstract
The invention permits to increase the cleaning action made with vertical, alternate motion, employing in succes sion on the different, front and side arch walls, two different brushing forms to obtain by changing the connexion of the two components with each other a brushing head 6 and a bearing handle 1 . The head 6 , with a rectangular base, employs a couple of orthogonal guides 4,5 for the alternate fitting of the handle 1 . One brushing form employs the head with a longitudinal settling to operate the side wall cleaning after its introduction into the mouth cavity. The other form employs the head with a transversal position to allow cleaning with centering effect of the front walls, to obtain by holding the handle from below.

## Description
Tooth brush with two settling forms for the head adjust ment to the different conditions of employ on the side and front parts of the dental arches. The invention refers to a cleaning brush for the teeth whi ch substantially foresees two different parts consisting of a brushing head,with a rectangular base,and a handle to be connected together in a solidarly operating way to give two different employ forms.In this way, the device form can be suited to the different conditions of employ that can occur to perform cleaning on either the side or the front walls of the dental arches.The present techniques of employ for the tooth brushes fo resees the cleaning action performed with alternate verti cal movement and with action in depth this to consent to the bristles to operate also in the interspaces and on the gums to remove residues,scratch the dental plate and perform a stimulating dynamic action on the gums.The present brushes have an essentially longitudinal conformation and foresee a handle supporting the brushing head.This shape turns out to be efficient for the operation on the side ar ch walls since the brush must penetrate into the mouth ca vity between the arches and the cheeck inside walls,but it is uneasy and irrational for carrying out cleaning of the arch front walls.Uneasy because the brush must be gri pped sidewise and irrational since this gripping system do es not allow to carry out the operation with a centering effect.In fact,it must be noted that the compression action the mucous membrane of the cheeck has to perform on the head during the cleaning phase of the arch side walls,in symbi osis with the movement action made by the operator, is fai ling in the cleaning phase of the front walls.On these pa rts,the depth action is related but to the force applied on the grip by the operator as it is foreseen for a side operation, it does consent a centering effect.The invention permits the solution of this problem by employing a device with changing geometry allowing to suit the form to the different employ conditions.In this way, it is possible to operate on the different arch parts with a permanent centering effect and uniform depth action.A brushing head is used with a rectangular base equipped wi th a pair of guides having an orthogonal disposition and a handle to fit alternatively into it to permit two emplo y forms namely,one with the head in longitudinal position for operating in the mouth cavity for cleaning the arch side walls,to be gripped sidewise and operated with alter nate,ideally horizontal movement,and the other,with tran sversal position ot the head,to be gripped from below,ope rated with alternate, ideally vertical motion,to allow cle aning of the front walls with centering effect.At first the operator starts with cleaning one arch part, then he connects the handle and the head according to the other employ form and accomplishes the cleaning action.A not limiting execution version is illustrated by the dra wings of Table 1,where Fig.1 the view of the system with orthogonal crossed guides on the head,and Fig.2 is the si de view of the same showing the kerf guide.Fig.3 is the perspective view or the head and of the grip end in posi tion preceding fitting.Fig.4 is a view of the brush fitte d with head in transversal disposltion.Fig.5 is the view of the head in longitudinal position fitted on the brush.The form just described employs a handle with grip 1 with additional slanting tapering part 2 and 3 with axial kerf conformation suitable for fitting alternatively on the or thogonal kerf guides 4 and 5 of head 6.The bending of par ts 2 and 3 on grip 1 allows holding the handle from below withount infering with the chin. To allow employ forms sol idarily operating,blocking devices are foresees on the ke rf components of different kinds,such us mechanical,tying automatisms and everything else for this purpose.An automatic execution form is illustrated by the drawings of Fig.1 and 6.The first one shows the spaces disposition on the axles of the excavation guides with spherical sector 7tact to keep in position the projecting corresponding parts of the small spheres 8 from bores 9,as illustrated in longitu dinal section in Fig.6.1Me retention system foresees heli cal springs 12,fitted on base 10, in cylindrical seats 11, compressing spheres 8 on bores 9, bearing the relevant pro jecting parts to enter into excavations 7 with spherical sector.It is well known that in order to obtain an efficient cle aning performing also the removal of dental plate,nylon brushes must be used and that these brushes have to be re placed every month at least since the bristles are deformed and lose their efficiency. The invention permits the employ of the handle as permane nt part and the use of a set of heads that can be singula rly replaced on account of wear.This new construction device allows the solution of two problems spare and possib ility of restoring the efficiency of the device using par ts already supplied with it,which excludes the necessity of separate purchases. In an additional solution,the employ has be en foreseen in a set one handle and some different heads,with a view to enabling the operator to use at wish sets of different brushing heads or,alternatively,to equip the family group with a set of head with a singular emplo y. The execution particulars such as the handle form,that of the head,of the brushing groups,the materials and everyth ing else in this connection may be foreseen in different ways.Similarly,the solidarily operating connection of the handle to the head may be performed otherwise by using se lfbinding parts, interposition parts,binding automatisms or anything else for this purpose.
