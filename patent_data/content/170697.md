## Description
This invention relates to immunotoxin conjugates, fused polypeptides for making such conjugates, and the use of such conjugates. More specifically, the invention relates to spacers for such conjugates and includes methods for preparing such spacers. Bacterial and plant toxins, such as diphtheria toxin DT , Derivatives of these bacterial and plant toxins have been prepared as therapeutic agents, primarily as antineoplastic agents, that are made specific for tumor cells or other target cells by replacing the native B chain s of the toxin molecule with a surrogate B chain that is specific for the tumor cell or adding a B chain having such specificity to the toxin molecule. Surrogate B moieties have been chemically linked to toxin A chains by a variety of coupling agents. Heterobifunctional agents that include a disulfide group have been used extensively. The most popular of these agents is N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP . The toxicity of diphtheria toxin for human lymphoblastoid cells was increased by covalent linkage to anti lymphoblastoid anti CLA 4 and anti Daudi globulin. Ross, W.C.J., et al, Dextran, polyglutamic acid, and oligopeptides containing up to four amino acid residues have been used as spacer arm bridges between cytotoxic drugs and antibodies. Moolten, F.L., et al, In summation, the efficacy of prior toxin antibody conjugates has been highly variable due, The present invention provides novel toxin conjugates which are peculiarly effective in recognizing target cells and in effecting their demise. It also provides other components of these conjugates. The conjugates comprise a cytotoxic component which is an enzymatically active portion of the molecule, capable of killing cells in which it is internalized, a specific binding moiety, typically an antibody or fragment of an antibody, which is capable of recognizing a specific antigenic determinant or target cell, and a spacer which provides the proper geometry between the cytotoxic component and the binding fragment. These conjugates represent an improved delivery system for naturally occuring or modified cytotoxins A chains which in their natural environment are bound to a relatively non specific binding component B chain which is generally not an antibody . The naturally occuring toxins also contain, within the A B chain fusion, sequences which are capable of cleavage intracellularly, ie which effect cleavage once the cytotoxic component has migrated to within the target cell, but are stable prior to this entry, and a translocation region which permits the desired cytotoxic A chain to enter the target cell. This intracellular cleavage exposes and labilizes the link typically disulfide between the A and B chain. In the conjugates of the present invention, the non binding portion of the molecule is constructed so as to retain the foregoing desired cytotoxic, intracellularly cleavable extracellularly stable, and translocation properties of the natural molecule in a geometry suitable for connecting to a binding fragment and permitting activity. Thus, typically, the conjugates of the invention include antibody or fragment of an antibody which is covalently linked, preferably through a bifunctional linker to a non binding entity. The non binding entity is an amino acid sequence which contains, to serve as the cytotoxic component, an enzymatically active site, an intracellularly cleavable extracellularly stable site and translocation sequence and, as an extension of this amino acid sequence, a further sequence which serves as a spacer between the cytotoxic component and the binding fragment to be linked. The non binding portion of the toxin conjugates of the invention may be supplied using recombinant techniques. The spacer confers the additional advantage of enhanced solubility in some instances where intermediates for desired immunotoxin may be sufficiently insoluble to interfere with their purification. By supplying a relatively more soluble portion, or by altering the conformation of the remainder of the molecule, the spacer thus permits more options in the selection of components and conjugation methods. The invention, therefore, relates to these conjugates and to the novel components used for their construction including especially those formed by recombinant means. Both the spacer segment and the non binding portion of the conjugate formed by fusion of the spacer with a cytotoxic component, ie, an extended spacer containing the cytotoxic component are aspects of the invention. Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to novel polypeptides the spacer consisting essentially of at least one rigid amino acid sequence bracketed by two flexible amino acid sequences ie, components of the formula flex rigid In the alternative, the spacer may be described in functional terms and comprises an amino acid sequence that The spacer may also be a solubilization conferring sequence of amino acids, as set forth hereinbelow. The foregoing spacer descriptions are not mutually exclusive, but are alternative characterizations of successful peptide sequences. The spacer may further contain a reactive amino acid residue proximate one of its termini so as to provide a conjugation site for the additional binding fragment. Other aspects of the invention are fused polypeptides for use in making toxin conjugates comprising The invention also concerns the DNA sequences encoding the spacer, toxin fragments, or fused polypeptide cytotoxic spacer expression vectors containing these DNA sequences, and cells transformed with these vectors. Still another aspect of the invention is a toxin conjugate which comprises The cytotoxic portion includes a site for intracellular cleavage within a serum stable domain and an internalization facilitating domain. In summary, the invention is designed to provide a toxin conjugate which has the appropriate geometry for translocating the cytotoxic fragment into the target cell, the capacity to retain its binding fragment prior to such translocation, and or the ability to solubilize the cytotoxic portion. In one aspect of the invention, the spacer is designed so as to permit the cytotoxic portion of the molecule ready access to the cell membrane. As the size of a typical antibody binding fragment is very much greater than that of most cytotoxic fragments, there is considerable steric hinderance of the access to the cell membrane by the cytotoxic portion imposed by the sheer bulk of the antibody or antibody fragments. Accordingly, the conjugate toxins of the invention have a geometry schematically represented in a rather than that given without the spacer b . In order to effect this translocation, the spacer needs to be sufficiently flexible to allow the A portion to reach the cell membrane, and sufficiently extended to permit it to have sufficient reach. The performance of the conjugated toxin can also be improved by securing the binding portion tightly to the remainder of the molecule with respect to a serum environment. This is done in one preferred embodiment of the invention, by utilizing a linker between the antibody and spacer which employs bonds not readily cleaved by reducing agents or by hydrolysis under extracellular conditions. The cleavage of the A chain analog ie the enzymatically active site from the other end of the spacer arm can be achieved by permitting the linkage at the A end of the spacer to be more readily cleavable. This can best be done by retaining a portion of the original B chain of the native toxin in linking the A portion to the spacer. In this manner, the normal extracellular resistant intracellular cleavable configuration of the A B chain pair is retained but with the loss of the binding capacity of the original B portion. Thus, the specific binding capability conferred by the antibody on the conjugate is not lost prior to intracellular incorporation of the cytotoxic fragment. Such flexibility in the nature of the non binding moieties available is provided through the recombinant methods of the invention. Since the binding portion confers specific recognition of certain target cells, the conjugated toxins are useful in killing specified undesirable cells within a subject. Thus, in two other aspects, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing effective amounts of these toxins and to methods of treatment employing them. Figure 1 shows the nucleotide sequence of the DT gene along with the corresponding deduced amino acid sequence. Figure 2 shows the construction of an Msp Spacer arm clone, pMspSA2. Figure 3 shows the construction of two Msp Spacer fragment expression vectors wherein the coding sequence is under the control of the P Figure 4 shows the construction of pTrpSmlMbo. As used herein the terms fragment , domain , and region and portion are interchangeable and refer to functionally but not necessarily physically distinct portions of the conjugated toxin molecule. The term specificity as used to describe the target cell binding portion of the conjugated toxin means that the moiety has the ability to distinguish a target cell from other cells, typically due to the presence of a cell surface receptor that is unique to the target cells. The term selective means that the cytotoxin has the ability to kill target cells preferentially, typically due to the specificity of the binding moiety or a differential in the respective quantities of receptors on target cells and other cells. The term target cells means those cells which the cytotoxin is intended to kill. Although target cells will usually be tumor cells, they may be nontumorous cells whose selective destruction is desired for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes for instance in certain assays of peripheral blood cells it is desired to selectively kill one or the other of B cells or T cells . The target cells may be present in living organisms or they may be preserved or maintained in vitro. The cells may be individual or associated to form an organ. As used herein the term polypeptide or protein refers to an amino acid polymer. It is understood that such polymers exist in a variety of ionization states dependent on ambient pH, and that they may, further, be associated with accessory moieties eg, glycosylated, phosphorylated or conjugated to lipids. The peptides or proteins of the invention include all such forms, including unassociated forms. The term intracellular is intended to include intracytoplasmic sites and sites within vesicular compartments such as lysosomes. Target cell binding portion refers to that fragment of the toxin conjugates of the invention which binds specifically to the target cells. In this invention the binding portion is an antibody or fragment thereof. The non binding portion or fragment of the toxin conjugate comprises the remainder of the molecule. It thus includes the cytotoxic portion and the spacer. The term cytotoxic portion includes the enzymatically active polypeptide fragment ie an A fragment analogous sequence, the intracellularly cleavable extracellularly stable domain and the translocation domain. As used herein with respect to the construction of the spacer domain, reactive amino acid residue refers to an amino acid or residue which provides a site for linking or conjugation, as further described below. Solubilizing conferring sequence of amino acids in the context of the invention refers to a form of spacer sequence which continues at the preferably C terminus of the cytotoxic portion and which results in the fused protein being soluble in aqueous media, even when the cytotoxic portion is itself insoluble or when the cytotoxic portion would otherwise be rendered insoluble by the addition of a cysteine residue. As used herein DT A fragment diphtheria toxin A fragment refers to an approximately 193 residue amino acid sequence which is capable of ADP ribosylation of EF 2, and which is substantially similar to the sequence in Figure 1 between amino acid 1 and amino acid 192 or 193. DT B fragment is an approximately 343 residue amino acid sequence which is substantially similar to the sequence approximately between amino acids 193 and 535 in Figure 1. DT A B fragment is an approximately 384 residue amino acid sequence which is capable of ADP ribosylation of EF 2, which contains both a translocation sequence and an intracellular cleavage site within an extracellularly stable domain, and which is substantially similar to the sequence shown in Figure 1 between amino acid 1 and amino acid 384. Msp fragment fragment 2 refers to an approximately 1454 bp segment which contains all of the A portion and part of the B portion i.e., a DT A B fragment along with at least part of native promoter, ribosome binding site and secretory leader sequence as shown in Figure 1. Msp terminator refers to a nucleotide sequence synthetically derived herein which encodes one additional amino acid past the Msp cleavage point plus a stop codon. The resultant Msp Msp terminator encodes a DT A B fragment. Mbo fragment fragment 1 refers to an approximately 831 bp resultant of an Mbo digest of the DT gene. It contains the coding sequence of amino acids 1 193 the A chain and leader and at least partial native control sequences see Fig. 1 . Mbo terminator refers to a nucleotide sequence synthetically derived herein which encodes an additional six amino acids past the Mbo cleavage plus a stop codon. The resultant Mbo Mbo terminator encodes a DT A fragment. Native promoter, ribosome binding site, or control sequences refer to those which are normally found in association with, and operably linked to, the DT coding sequence. Leader sequence refers to that portion of the DNA which encodes the native pre sequence, responsible for secretion of the mature protein. As used herein, ricin A refers to a protein whose amino acid sequence is substantially similar to that of the ricin A peptide which is extractable from castor bean seeds. The ricin A of castor beans is approximately 265 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of approximately 32,000 daltons. However, it is known that the precise sequence varies depending on the variety of bean, and, indeed that at least two slightly different forms of ricin A may be present in a single variety. Ricin B refers to a protein whose amino acid sequence is substantially similar to that of the ricin B peptide which is extractable from castor bean seeds. The ricin B of castor beans is approximately 260 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of approximately 34,700 daltons as with ricin A, it is known that the precise sequence varies depending on the variety of bean. Substantially similar means that the protein in question must be approximately the same length arbitrarily within around 10 but, more importantly, must retain the capacity of reference chain to carry out its native biological activity. It is well known that some small alterations in protein sequence may be possible without disturbing the functional abilities of the protein molecule, although other modifications are totally destructive. It is not currently possible to predict with any assurance into which category a particular alteration will fall. The definition herein permits any modifications which are in the first category. Such alterations could result from chance mutations in the gene sequence or from deliberate alterations thereof. Further, as is well known, protein sequences may be modified by post translational processing such as association with other molecules, for example, glycosides, lipids, or such inorganic ions as phosphate. The ionization status will also vary depending on the pH of the medium or the pH at which crystallisation or precipitation of the isolated form occurs. Further, the presence of air may cause oxidation of labile groups, such as SH. Included within the definition of the peptides defined herein are all such modifications of a particular primary structure ie, eg, both glycosylated and non glycosylated forms, neutral forms, acidic and basic salts, lipid or other associated peptide forms, side chain alterations due to oxidation or derivatization, and any other such modifications of an amino acid sequence which would be encoded by the same genetic codon sequence. Ricin refers to peptides which contain both A and B chains, defined respectively as set forth herein. The peptide may mimic the native peptide in that the A and B proteins are linked only by a disulfide, or may contain the intermediate dodecamer or other short peptide sequence between the A and B chains. Operably linked when used in describing DNA sequences refers to juxtaposition in such a way that the functionality of the sequences is preserved. Thus, for example a coding sequence operably linked to control sequences is positioned so that the these sequences are capable of effecting the expression of the coding sequence. Control sequence refers to those DNA sequences which control initiation and termination of transcription and translation. In procaryotic systems, for example, control sequences comprise promoter or promoter operator and nucleotides encoding a ribosome binding site in eucaryotes, promoters, terminators and enhancers appear to be involved. Toxin conjugates have classically been conceptualized as combinations of an A fragment and a surrogate B moiety, attached through linking group that binds these fragments via a labile bridge such as a disulfide bridge. The rationale behind this conceptualization was that the function of the B moiety was primarily to bind the conjugate to the cell surface via interaction with a cell surface receptor and that the disulfide bridge provided means for joining the A fragment and B moiety that could be broken In the most preferred embodiment of the present invention with respect to toxin conjugates each of these factors is taken into account in synthesizing a novel toxin conjugate having five functional elements which may overlap in the structure of the conjugate In the most preferred embodiment the binding moiety is bound to the non binding portion of the molecule ie the remaining elements 1 4 by a chemical bond that is substantially resistant to cleavage The enzymatically active fragment of the conjugate may be the A chain of a bacterial or plant toxin or be a natural protein that has enzymatic activity similar to the A chain of a bacterial or plant toxin. As used herein the terms enzymatically active fragment and A chain are intended to include such similar acting natural proteins. Examples of such A chains are diphtheria A chain, exotoxin A chain from The derivation of an A chain from a whole natural toxin molecule involves breaking the bond s between the A and B chain s eg, reducing the disulfide bonds s between the A and B chain s with an appropriate reducing agent, such as 2 mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol and isolating the A chain from the B chain s . The isolation may be carried out chromatographically or by other conventional protein fractionation techniques. The natural proteins that have enzymatic activity similar to the A chains of the natural protein toxins may be isolated from their sources, typically plant parts, by conventional protein extraction and isolation techniques. Alternatively, and preferably, these amino acid sequences are derived using recombinant techniques. The intracellular cleavage site domain of the cytotoxin is preferably one that functions in a way that mimics the manner in which a natural toxin liberates its A chain. Three cleavage mechanisms are postulated currently 1 proteolysis either enzymatic or chemical eg, pH change , 2 disulfide reduction, and most commonly 3 a combination of 1 and 2 . The cleavage site s of such domains is substantially stable extracellularly and is labile intracellularly. In the cleavage mechanisms involving proteolysis and disulfide reduction, extracellular stability is probably due to the position of the disulfide cleavage site in the extracellular tertiary structure of the conjugate. That is, the site is not exposed to cleavage agents in the extracellular environment, but is exposed in the intracellular environment due to a change in the tertiary structure of the molecule. Cleavage sites whose lability depends on pH are stable in extracellular environments, eg, blood, having a substantially neutral pH. The lower pH of certain intracellular compartments eg, within a lysosome or receptosome makes the site labile. The cleavage site domain comprises a sequence of amino acids that includes residues that are susceptible to proteolysis such as by lysosomal proteases. When disulfide reduction is involved the sequence will obviously contain a disulfide bridge formed by spaced cysteine residues. When both proteolysis and reduction are involved the A chain is liberated from the remainder of the toxin conjugate by proteolysis at the sensitive residues that causes a nick or break in the polypeptide backbone of the molecule and reduction of the disulfide bond. Examples of residues that are lysosomal protease sensitive are arginine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. In a preferred embodiment, this cleavage site in a serum stable domain is proximate the enzymatically active domain and forms an extension of the C terminus thereof. Such a configuration can be provided most conveniently by providing an extended A fragment from a naturally occurring toxin into a portion of the natural B chain. Recombinant techniques are best suited to this embodiment, since convenient peptide cleavage techniques specific for the desired extension may not exist for a given toxin. However, the coding sequence can be cleaved and modified so as to encode for just the desired fragment. The internalization facilitating or translocation domain of the conjugate participates in interacting with the cell or vesicle wall whereby the wall is penetrated, opened, or disrupted to enable the conjugate to reach the intracellular compartment. The internalization facilitating domain may be identical to, or substantially similar in, amino acid content and sequence to an internalization facilitating domain of a bacterial or plant toxin or a polypeptide that is known to interact similarly with cell membranes. In the case of DT, the domain has been identified as being hydrophobic and located within the B fragment. The sequence of that segment possibly includes the following Examples of polypeptides that are known to have a similar interaction with cell membranes are melittin and delta lysine The position of the domain in the toxin conjugate molecule may vary. It will usually be located adjacent to the carboxy terminus of the A chain but may also be located adjacent to the amino terminus of the A chain. More than one internalization facilitating domain may be included in the conjugate if desired. Since this domain is positioned adjacent the A chain, its inclusion in the toxin conjugate is most conveniently accomplished by recombinant DNA techniques. In DT, for example, the extension of the polypeptide sequence at the C terminus approximately 193 amino acids into the B chain provides such an internalization domain. Therefore, cloning and expression of the coding sequence for this portion of the DT toxin would provide the desired configuration. Alternatively, the oligonucleotides encoding known internalizing domains such as those exemplified above can be ligated to the nucleotides encoding the desired A fragment for cloning and expression. The spacer comprises a sequence of amino acids that can be described in one of three non mutually exclusive ways. In any case, the end of the spacer that attaches to the binding moiety may have a reactive amino acid residue at or near the terminus that provides a site for conjugating the binding moiety. For instance, if a reactive amino group at or near the end of the spacer is desired one or more lysine residues may be located near one terminus of the spacer fragment. If a reactive sulfhydryl group is desired, a cysteine residue may be situated similarly. In one aspect, the spacer is described as having one or more extended structure portions segments in which the peptide bond angles are enlarged linked by segments that are flexible. Each end of the spacer terminates with a flexible segment. The spacer thus links the target cell binding moiety to the remainder of the molecule with the extended structure portion s serving to separate the binding moiety and the remainder of the molecule and the flexible segments permitting three dimensional movement of the binding moiety and the remainder of the molecule. Thus the spacer can be described as being formed from a series of extended structure portions in tandem with intermediate flexible regions the flexible regions lie on either side of the extended structure regions , ie, has the general formula flex rigid In a second aspect, the spacer is substantially nonhydrophobic so that it has a neutral or positive effect on the water solubility of the conjugate. The spacer s hydrophobicity may be determined by summing the hydrophobicities of the individual amino acids measured by partition coefficient tests of which it is composed. A substantially nonhydrophobic sequence will measure neutral or hydrophilic. The hydrophilic nature of this segment will also place it on the surface of the configured molecule, thereby permitting accessibility for conjugation. If the function of a particular spacer is merely to provide solubility during processing to a cytotoxic portion amino acid sequence, this property is, indeed, the only property required of it. Generally, the spacer is a relatively hydrophilic sequence, typically containing a cysteine residue. In a third aspect, the spacer can also be described in functional terms as substantially stable in human serum, having a length selected such that it provides an extended structure link at least about 15 A long, preferably about 30 to about 100 A long, between the binding moiety and the remainder of the conjugate molecule, as being substantially non hydrophobic so as not to adversely affect solubility, and having sufficient flexibility to permit three dimensional movement of the cytotoxic component with respect to the binding component. The binding moiety may be any ligand that has the required target cell specificity. Antibodies, particularly monoclonal antibodies or their antigen binding fragments, are preferred binding moieties. Monoclonal antibodies against surface receptors of target cells may be made by the somatic cell hybridization procedure first described by Kohler, G. and Milstein, C., Depending on the sizes of the four polypeptide domains that make up the nonbinding portion of the conjugate toxins, these domains may be synthesized individually or as subunits by conventional polypeptide synthesis techniques Margolin, A. and Merrifield, R.B., Recombinant DNA methodology provides an alternative and preferred way of synthesizing the nonbinding portion of the conjugate, either as individual subunits, or as an entire fused polypeptide. This process involves obtaining a DNA sequence that encodes the nonbinding portion or a particular domain or combination of domains inserting the DNA sequence into a suitable expression vector, transforming microorganisms or cells with the vector, growing transformants that produce the desired fragment and harvesting the desired fragment from the transformants or their growth medium. The coding sequence may be made by synthesis of DNA subunits that encode portions of the enzymatically active fragment, translocation domain, cleavage site domain, and spacer domain and assembling them by ligation techniques known in the art, or by cloning those portions of naturally occuring genes which encode the desired protein. The DNA sequence that encodes the enzymatically active fragment will normally be isolated from naturally occurring DNA as may the sequence encoding the cleavage and translocation domains. These and the spacer encoding sequence may also be made by conventional DNA synthesis techniques, and may be reproduced by conventional DNA cloning methods. Partial structural genes of bacterial or plant toxins that lack a binding function but retain their enzymatic, cleavage and internalization functions eg, the CRM 45 mutant of DT may be cloned and ligated to a DNA sequence that encodes the spacer. The ligation product is inserted into suitable expression hosts and expressed to make the nonbinding portion of the conjugate. The binding portions of the conjugates of the invention are antibodies or fragments thereof. Use of monoclonal antibodies is preferred. Antibodies are prepared by means well known in the art, and can be isolated from serum, from spleen, or most preferably prepared and isolated from antibody secreting hybridomas. Many are commercially available see B.5 herein . Since the antibodies or fragments thereof are prepared by reactions of immunoglobulins isolated from serum or from hydridomas, they must be linked Activation of the carboxyl groups is required to permit reaction with amino groups of the chosen protein. The desired activated derivatives of the foregoing acids include most preferably the succinimidyl ester, ie although others, especially esters, have been used, such as the water soluble ester formed from 1 hydroxy 2 nitro 4 sulfonic acid sodium salt, Other coupling agents that may be used are various bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl, active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate, aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, bis azido compounds such as bis In a typical, preferred approach, a thioether linkage is formed between a sulfhydryl on the non binding portion of the conjugate and the coupling agent and an amide linkage is formed between an ε NH₂ of a lysine contained in the binding portion and the carboxyl of the coupling agent. When used to kill target cells When used For parenteral administration the cytotoxins will be formulated in a unit dosage injectable form solution, suspension, emulsion in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle. Such vehicles are inherently nontoxic and nontherapeutic. Examples of such vehicles are water, saline, Ringer s solution, dextrose solution, and Hank s solution. Nonaqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate may also be used. Liposomes may be used as carriers. The vehicle may contain minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability, eg buffers and preservatives. The cytotoxin will typically be formulated in such vehicles at concentrations of about 1 mg ml to 10 mg ml. Procaryotes may be used for both cloning and expression and most frequently are represented by various strains of In addition to bacteria, eucaryotic microbes, such as yeast, may also be used as hosts. Laboratory strains of It is also, of course, possible to express genes encoding polypeptides in eucaryotic host cell cultures derived from multicellular organisms. See, for example, Finally, cells from and portions of higher plants have been found useful as recombinant hosts, and appropriate control sequences are available for expression in these systems. A suitable promoter and polyadenylation signal are those of the nopaline synthase NOS gene derived from the 3.2 kilobase kb HindIII 23 DNA fragment in the T DNA region of Depending on the host cell used, transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride, as described by Cohen, S. N., cDNA or genomic libraries are screened using the colony hybridization procedure. Each microtiter plate is replicated onto duplicate nitrocellulose filter papers S S type BA 85 and colonies are allowed to grow at 37 C for 14 16 hr on L agar containing 50 µg ml Amp. The colonies are lysed and DNA fixed to the filter by sequential treatment for 5 min with 500 mM NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl, and are washed twice for 5 min each time with 5 x standard saline citrate SSC . Filters are air dried and baked at 80 C for 2 hr. The duplicate filters are prehybridized at 42 C for 6 8 hr with 10 ml per filter of DNA hybridization buffer 5 x SSC, pH 7.0 5x Denhardt s solution polyvinylpyrrolidine, plus Ficoll and bovine serum albumin 1 x 0.02 of each , 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 0.2 SDS, 20 µg ml Poly U, and 50 µg ml denatured salmon sperm DNA . The samples are hybridized with kinased probe under conditions which depend on the stringency desired. Typical moderately stringent conditions employ a temperature of 42 C for 24 36 hr with 1 5 ml filter of DNA hybridization buffer containing probe. For higher stringencies high temperatures and shorter times are employed. The filters are washed four times for 30 min each time at 37 C with 2 x SSC, 0.2 SDS and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7, then are washed twice with 2 x SSC and 0.2 SDS, air dried, and are autoradiographed at 70 C for 2 to 3 days. Construction of suitable vectors containing the desired coding and control sequences employs standard ligation and restriction techniques which are well understood in the art. Isolated plasmids, DNA sequences, or synthesized oligonucleotides are cleaved, tailored, and religated in the form desired. Site specific DNA cleavage is performed by treating with the suitable restriction enzyme or enzymes under conditions which are generally understood in the art, and the particulars of which are specified by the manufacturer of these commercially available restriction enzymes. See, e.g., New England Biolabs, Product Catalog. In general, about 1 µg of plasmid or DNA sequence is cleaved by one unit of enzyme in about 20 µl of buffer solution in the examples herein, typically, an excess of restriction enzyme is used to insure complete digestion of the DNA substrate. Incubation times of about one hour to two hours at about 37 C are workable, although variations can be tolerated. After each incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol chloroform, and may be followed by ether extraction, and the nucleic acid recovered from aqueous fractions by precipitation with ethanol followed by running over a Sephadex G 50 spin column. If desired, size separation of the cleaved fragments may be performed by polyacrylamide gel or agarose gel electrophoresis using standard techniques. A general description of size separations is found in Restriction cleaved fragments may be blunt ended by treating with the large fragment of Exonuclease III attacks double stranded DNA, but hydrolyzes beginning at the 3 end of the nucleotide sequence. Thus, digestion of a double stranded DNA results in two 5 protruding sticky ends. Hydrolysis is carried out in a buffer containing 15 mM Tris, pH 8, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl₂, and 0.1 mM DTT, using approximately 2000 units per µl exonuclease III. Ordinarily, 150 units of exonuclease III were used to react with 10 µg DNA. Synthetic oligonucleotides are prepared by the triester method of Matteucci, et al Ligations are performed in 15 30 µl volumes under the following standard conditions and temperatures 20 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM DTT, 33 µg ml BSA, 10 mM 50 mM NaCl, and either 40 µM ATP, 0.01 0.02 Weiss units T4 DNA ligase at 0 C for sticky end ligation or 1 mM ATP, 0.3 0.6 Weiss units T4 DNA ligase at 14 C for blunt end ligation . Intermolecular sticky end ligations are usually performed at 33 100 µg ml total DNA concentrations 5 100 nM total end concentration . Intermolecular blunt end ligations usually employing a 10 30 fold molar excess of linkers are performed at 1 µM total ends concentration. In vector construction employing vector fragments , the Vector fragment is commonly treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase BAP in order to remove the 5 phosphate and prevent religation of the vector. BAP digestions are conducted at pH 8 in approximately 150 mM Tris, in the presence of Na and Mg² using about 1 unit of BAP per µg of vector at 60 C for about one hour. In order to recover the nucleic acid fragments, the preparation is extracted with phenol chloroform and ethanol precipitated and desalted by application to a Sephadex G 50 spin column. Alternatively, religation can be prevented in vectors which have been double digested by additional restriction enzyme digestion of the unwanted fragments. For portions of vectors derived from cDNA or genomic DNA which require sequence modifications, site specific primer directed mutagenesis is used. This is conducted using a primer synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to a single stranded phage DNA to be mutagenized except for limited mismatching, representing the desired mutation. Briefly, the synthetic oligonucleotide is used as a primer to direct synthesis of a strand complementary to the phage, and the resulting double stranded DNA is transformed into a phage supporting host bacterium. Cultures of the transformed bacteria are plated in top agar, permitting plaque formation from single cells which harbor the phage. Theoretically, 50 of the new plaques will contain the phage having, as a single strand, the mutated form 50 will have the original sequence. The resulting plaques are hybridized with kinased synthetic primer at a temperature which permits hybridization of an exact match, but at which the mismatches with the original strand are sufficient to prevent hybridization. Plaques which hybridize with the probe are then picked, cultured, and the DNA recovered. In more detail, approximately one pmole of the phage single stranded DNA template is mixed with approximately 10 pmoles of the synthetic oligonucleotide primer in 15 µl of 10 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl₂, 90 mM NaCl. The mixture is heated to 67 for 3 5 min and then to 42 for 30 min. The mixture is then cooled on ice, and a cold solution containing the 4 dNTPs at 500 µM and 3 5 units of Polymerase I Klenow in sufficient buffer to bring the volume to 20 25 µl is added. The mixture is left at 0 C for 5 min and then brought to 37 for 30 min. The Klenow is then inactivated for 15 min at 75 , and the mixture transformed into an appropriate host, such as The fixed, pre hybridized filters are then hybridized with 2 x 10⁵ cpm ml of kinased synthetic primer oligonucleotide approximately 2 10 x 10⁷ cpm µg for 3 16 hr, and then washed in 6 x SSC once at room temperature for 5 min and then at the appropriate stringent temperature for 5 min. A simultaneous control run containing the original phage is used to verify that hybridization does not take place to the non mutagenized strands. In the constructions set forth below, correct ligations for plasmid construction are confirmed by first transforming Host strains used in cloning and expression herein are as follows For M13 phage recombinants, The successful expression attained by the invention depends upon correct utilization of the suitable control sequences to regulate expession of the desired toxin fragment. Therefore, whatever the host, control sequences compatible with and suitable for that host are positioned operably with respect to the coding sequence, using a properly placed start codon at the 5 end of the desired sequence. Any native control sequences are eliminated. The vectors of the invention place the coding sequence for the desired protein immediately preceded by an ATG start codon directly downstream from control systems chosen to be compatible with the particular host. It is also important, in obtaining good production of the desired fragments, to regulate the time of production so as to minimize any lethal effect on the host cell. Most typically, even for procaryotes, this is done by delaying expression of the desired protein sequences until substantial growth has occurred. Accordingly, it is desirable to utilize control sequences which are subject to environmental conditions. By maintaining conditions that repress expression during growth phase, and then converting to conditions which permit expression at the desired time, the negative aspects of any potentially lethal effect can be minimized. In two particularly preferred approaches, these regulatable control sequences are compatible with procaryotic hosts. The trp promoter is a regulatable promoter where expression of the operably linked sequence can be controlled by the level of tryptophan in the medium. By maintaining high tryptophan levels during growth, expression is repressed. Depletion or competitive inhibition of tryptophan turns on the promoter and permits expression. Still more preferred is the P A plasmid which has temperature sensitive copy number control may also be applied. If the cells are grown at low temperatures, coding sequences contained in the plasmid are replicated at low levels at higher temperatures, the number of such copies is increased. The amount of protein produced is thus indirectly managed by regulating the number of available copies of its coding sequence. Several vectors which provide control sequences and replicons useful in obtaining the various conjugate non binding sequences are described below. These include pCS3, a temperature sensitive, high copy number plasmid, pFC5, pP The temperature sensitive, high copy number plasmid pCS3 was deposited with ATCC 3 June 1982 and has accession number 39142. pCS3 is derived from pEW27 and pOP9. pEW27 is described by E. M. Wong, pOP9 is a high copy number plasmid at all temperatures which was constructed by inserting into pBR322 the EcoRI PvuII origin containing fragment from Col E1 type plasmid pOP6 Gelfand, D., et al, One candidate, designated pOP7, was chosen and the BamHI site deleted by digesting 25 g of pOP7 with 20 units BamHI, repairing with Ligation of 1.42 kb EcoRI AvaI repair Tet Competent DG75 was transformed with 5 µl of the ligation mixture, and transformants were selected on ampicillin 50 µg ml containing plates, pOP9, isolated from Amp To obtain pCS3, 50 µg pEW27 DNA was digested to completion with PvuII and the EcoRI. Similarly, 50 µg of pOP9 was digested to completion with PvuII and EcoRI and the 3.3 kb fragment was isolated. 0.36 µg 0.327 pmoles pEW27 fragment and 0.35 µg 0.16 pmoles pOP9 fragment were ligated and used to transform Three plasmids were constructed which can serve as sources for the EcoRI or PstI HindIII P The BglII site immediately preceding the P pβI Z15, deposited 13 January 1984, ATCC No. 39578, was prepared by fusing a sequence containing ATG plus 140 bp of β IFN fused to lac Z into pBR322. In pβI Z15, the EcoRI site of pBR322 is retained, and the insert contains a HindIII site immediately preceding the ATG start codon of β IFN. pβI Z15 was restricted with HindIII, repaired with Klenow and dNTPs, and then digested with EcoRI. The resulting EcoRI HindIII repaired vector fragment was ligated with the EcoRI HinfI repaired fragment above, and the ligation mixture used to transform MC1000 39531. Transformants containing the successful construction were identified by ability to grow on lactose minimal plates at 34 but not at 30 . Transformations were plated on X gal Amp plates at 30 and 34 and minimal lactose plates at 30 and 34 . Transformants with the proper construction are blue on X gal Amp plates at both temperatures, but on minimal lactose plates, grow only at 34 . The successful construct was designated pFC5. In the alternative, pBR322 may also be used as the cloning vector to carry the desired EcoRI HindIII P The third host plasmid vector used to obtain the cassette was pDG144, deposited January 13, 1984, ATCC No. 39579. pDG144 is extensively described in another application and is not part of the invention. It is an altered pBR322 containing an intact Amp Accordingly, pDG144 was digested with HindIII, blunt ended with Klenow and dNTPs, and then digested with EcoRI. The vector fragment was ligated with the above prepared EcoRI HinfI repaired fragment and transformed into MC1000 39531. Amp Each of the above resulting vectors, pFC5, pP pCS3 was then modified to provide the P To construct the host vector containing the trp control sequences behind a HindIII site, the trp promoter operator ribosome binding site sequence, lacking the attenuator region, was obtained from pVH153, obtained from C. Yanofsky, Stanford University. Trp sequences are available in a variety of such plasmids known in the art. pVH153 was treated with HhaI which cuts leaving an exposed 3 sticky end just 5 of the trp promoter blunt ended with Klenow, and partially digested with TaqI. The 99 bp fragment corresponding to restriction at the TaqI site, 6 nucleotides preceding the ATG start codon of trp leader was isolated, and then ligated to EcoRI repair ClaI digested, pBR322 to provide pTRP3. pTRP3 was deposited with ATCC 18 December 1984 and has accession number 39946. pDG141 contains the trp control sequences immediately upstream from an ATG start codon. It was deposited with the ATCC January 24, 1984, and given the accession number 39588. The sequence downstream of the ATG provides a SacI cleavage site which cuts between the G and the succeeding bp. In the construction of pDG141, a derivative of pBR322, pTRP3, is used to provide a trp PstI HindIII cassette and pBW20 to provide the ATG and SacI site. pBW20 contains a synthetic ATG containing dodecamer cloned into the HindIII PvuII vector fragment from pBR322. The dodecamer, TATGAGCTCATA, contains SstI or SacI sites. To prepare pBW20, pBR322 was digested with HindIII, repaired with Klenow and the four dNTPs, and then digested with PvuII. The vector fragment was ligated with the self complementary dodecamer and transformed into 12 ng of pTRP3 restricted with PstI and HindIII was ligated with 1.34 ng of similarly restricted pBW20. The ligation mixture was subsequently digested with BamHI to linearize any ligation products which contained the HindIII PstI unwanted vector fragment from pTRP3. The ligation mixture was used to transform An illustrative and preferred embodiment of the invention comprises the components and intermediates in a specific conjugated toxin. In this toxin, the binding fragment consists of anti Daudi antibodies which are linked by reaction with the succinimidyl ester of m maleimidobenzoic acid to a spacer portion of the formula which is in turn a C terminal extension of a portion of the naturally occurring diphtheria toxin. Thus, the conjugate toxin here exemplified can be represented by the formula wherein DTA represents the enzymatically active portion, or A chain of diphtheria toxin, DT B represents the first approximately 190 amino acids of the diphtheria B chain, and AB represents the anti Daudi antibody. In this embodiment, three of the elements of the non binding portion of the conjugate toxin are derived from diphtheria toxin the enzymatically active domain, the cleavage site domain and the translocation domain. The mature diphtheria toxin molecule including both A and B chains contains 535 amino acid residues of which the A chain the amino terminal fragment contains 193 residues and the B chain the carboxy terminal fragment contains 342 residues. It appears that the intracellular cleavage site between the A and B chains in the native toxin is after one of the three Arg residues. Such cleavage readily takes place Fig. 1 shows the sequence of the diphtheria toxin gene and the flanking regions, along with the deduced amino acid sequence. The deduced sequence is in reasonable agreement with the previously reported primary amino acid sequence data Delange, R.J., et al, The entire toxin gene sequence is carried by bacteriophage β and can be isolated from the phage by restriction with Xba 1 and EcoRI. A shorter MspI fragment within this sequence see Fig 1 comprises most of the sequence used in the illustrative construct herein, this fragment results from Mspl restriction about 300 bp preceding the first amino acid codon, and at the site shown at the codon encoding amino acid 382, approximately in the middle of the B fragment. The construction of the illustrated conjugate toxin may be summarized as follows Additional non binding fragments are also recombinantly derived as illustrated below, and used to obtain alternate conjugates. DNA was isolated from corynephage β To prepare DNA, high titered β phage stocks were prepared in TYE medium 15 g l bactotryptone, 10 g l yeast extract, 5 g l NaCl supplemented with 1 mM CaCl₂ , by the method of Holmes, R.K., et al Approximately 500 µg of the phage DNA MW 22 x 10⁶ daltons was treated with EcoRI and XbaI and the resulting mixture run on 1.7 liters 1 agarose gel at 90 volts for 35 hr. The XbaI EcoRI fragment 1.5 x 10⁶ daltons containing the toxin gene was cut out, run through a syringe, and electroeluted in 1 10 TBE for 4 hrs at 500 volts onto a spectropore dialysis membrane. The DNA was retrieved from the membrane using 0.25 SDS in 1 10 TBE, phenol extracted, ether extracted, and ethanol precipitated. The resulting DNA was further restricted with MspI, the DNA resolved on 5 PAGE, and the two MspI fragments isolated by the crush and soak method. The large Msp fraction see Fig 1 which contained control sequences, leader, A, and partial B sequences from the toxin was cloned by ligating approximately 5 ng of the fragment with 2 µg of ClaI restricted, BAPed, pBR322. The ligation mixture was transformed into A DNA fragment encoding the amino acid sequence and flanked by sequences defining convenient restriction sites and a stop codon was designed and synthesized by conventional DNA synthesis procedures. and its complement were prepared using the triester method of Matteucci supra and annealed and kinased to give the double stranded sequence The annealed sequence was cloned as follows pBR322 25.72 µg was restricted with SalI and HindIII, BAPed, phenol extracted and desalted over a one cc Sephadex G 50 column. The kinased annealed, double stranded spacer encoding sequence 0.2 pmoles was ligated with 1 µg of the plasmid vector fragment, and the ligation mixture was used to transform The plasmid, pMspSA2 which contains the MspI fragment coding sequence ligated to the spacer coding sequence was contructed as outlined in Fig 2. pSA1 plasmid DNA 77 µg was restricted with SalI and ClaI, run on a 12 polyacrylamide gel and the fragment containing the spacer arm sequence isolated by the crush and soak method. One half the sample was further restricted with AluI to give Fragment A . As shown in Fig 2, the Alu cleavage results in a blunt end 6 bp upstream from the glycine codon. The large MspI fragment 10 ng isolated from phage as in F.1 was blunt ended by filling in with Klenow fragment and dNTPs. The mixture was run over a Sephadex G 50 column, treated with HindIII, and re run over a 1 cc Sephadex G 50 column to give fragment B . As seen from Fig 1. HindIII restriction deletes a portion of the DT control sequences, but probably leaves at least a portion of the promoter and ribosome binding site, and the entire leader sequence. For the vector, 77 µg pSA1 was restricted with HindIII and SalI, treated with BAP, and the vector DNA fragment purified with a 1 cc Sephadex G 50 column to give fragment C . The ligation mixture consisted of 4 µg of fragment C, 3 ng of fragment B, and 20 ng of fragment A under standard ligation conditions. Following ligation overnight at 12 C, the mixture was transformed into The preparation of pATGMspSA is outlined in Fig 3. pTrpSmlMbo 55µg was double digested with AccI and ClaI and the short fragment spanning the ATG start codon and a portion of the A fragment isolated. See Fig 4 for relevant sequences in pTrpSmlMbo and F.4.a. below for its construction. A vector fragment was prepared by digesting 25 µg of pMspSA with ClaI, and treating with BAP. The missing portions of the Msp toxin fragment were supplied by a digest of 50 µg of pMspSA with AccI and ClaI and isolating the 764 bp fragment between these sites in the coding sequence. A ligation mixture containing 250 ng of the ATG partial A fragment from pTrpSmlMbo, 700 ng of the partial A partial B fragment from pMspSA and 2 µg of the spacer vector fragment from pMspSA was transformed into pTrpSmlMbo contains the DT A fragment coding sequence followed by the Mbo terminator sequence supra under the control of the trp promoter. The construction is from pTS12 a plasmid containing the DT A and Mbo terminator and pDG141, which contains the trp promoter see Fig 4 which encodes the amino acid sequence subsequent to the Mbo cleavage site for six additional amino acids prior to a termination codon was synthesized using the triester method of Matteucci, et al supra kinased and hybridized to the complementary synthetic fragment to give One pmole of the double stranded oligonucleotide was then placed in a three way ligation mixture with 1.4 pmoles 0.8 µg of Mbo fragment 1 and the vector fragment formed from 1 µg pBR322 which had been treated with BamHI, SalI and BAP. The mixture was ligated overnight before transforming into pTS12 53.5 µg was restricted with HhaI blunt ended with Klenow, 18 µg of the resulting fragments ligated to 3.15 nmoles of the oligomeric linker CCCCGGGG, and then treated with SmaI. The resulting sequence at the 5 terminus was thus modified to give the sequence GGGGCTGA which encodes the peptide sequence beginning with amino acid 1 of the DT A fragment, See Fig 4 . The 3 end of the ligation product terminates in the first HhaI site of pBR322 following the SalI site, and the fragment contains the entire coding sequence along with in reading frame with terminator for the small Mbo fragment. The desired 654 bp fragment was isolated using 6 PAGE, and elution by crush and soak. One picomole of this modified prepared fragment was ligated with 0.7 µg of pDG141 which had been restricted with SacI, blunt ended with Klenow, and BAPed the preparation of pDG141 is described above . The pDG141 derived fragment has an ATG start codon operably linked to the trp promoter. The resulting ligation mixture was transformed into The cells were grown to log phase in 10 ml of the TYE Amp 100 medium at 37 for 4 hr. To demonstrate expression, one ml of the culture was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in 20 µl buffer containing 625 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 3 SDS. After heating at 95 C for 5 min, samples were run in 12.5 SDS PAGE with a 3 stacking Laemmli, et al, One expression vector, pP A second vector, pP The colonies transformed with each of the foregoing plasmids were grown at 30 C in TYE medium containing 100 µg ml ampicillin, and at the end of log phase the temperature raised to 42 C. After 1.5 hr the cells were centrifuged and sonicated and the sonicate assayed by the assay of Chung, D.W., et al, The DT A B spacer was conjugated with an antibreast monoclonal antibody 260F9, hybridoma deposited at the ATCC on 27 January 1984 under accession number HB8488. Ricin toxin A chain RTA or diphtheria toxin A chain DTA which contain free sulfhydryl groups for analogous conjugation with the antibody were thus conjugated. These conjugates were assayed for immunotoxicity. To form the conjugate, breast monoclonal antibody 260F9 or other antibodies as specified below were first derivatized with SPDP or mal sac HNSA . The antibodies derivatized to SPDP were used to form disulfide links to the free cysteine sulfhydryls of DT A B spacer, DTA or RTA. Those derivatized with mal sac HNSA were used to form thioether linkages with DT A B spacer. For SPDP, a 10 20 fold molar excess of SPDP was added to a solution containing 20 mg ml of antibody in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr, and then dialyzed against PBS to remove unreacted SPDP. It was calculated that approximately 2 5 pyridyl disulfide moieties were introduced into each antibody using this procedure. To complete the conjugation with SPDP to give a disulfide linkage to the cytotoxic portions, DT A B spacer solution or solution of RTA or DTA containing 1 2 mg ml which had been stored in reducing agent in 4 C was passed over a Sephadex G 25 column equilibrated in PBS to remove the reducing agent, and the DT A B spacer or other cytotoxic portion was mixed with derivatized antibody in 2 4 molar excess cytotoxic portion. Conjugation was confirmed by spectrophotometric determination of released pyridine 2 thiol and by SDS PAGE. For mal sac HNSA, approximately 0.2 ml of mal sac HNSA solution containing 1 mg ml was added to 1 ml antibody solution containing 3 8 mg ml in PBS. The mixture was kept at room temperature and monitored until 5 mal sac HNSA moieties were incorporated per antibody. The reaction was then stopped by desalting the mixture on a G 25 column equilibrated in 0.1 M Na phosphate, pH 6. The DT A B spacer, stored in reducing agent at 4 C, was passed over PBS equilbiated Sephadex G 25 to remove reducing agent, and the protein 1 2 mg ml mixed in 2 4 molar excess with the derivatized antibody. Conjugation was confirmed by SDS PAGE. In a typical protocol, breast tumor cells MCF 7 were seeded in 8 ml glass vials and dilutions of the immunoconjugates were added. Following incubation for 22 hr at 37 C, the medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 35 The results of these assays are shown in Table 1 both for 260F9, and other antibody partners. The foregoing assay was run as set forth above, using the 260F9 conjugate but substituting alternate cell lines for MCF 7. The results are shown in Table 2. The cell lines shown, CAMA 1, BT 20, and SKBR 3 are other breast tumor cell lines a normal fibroblast cell line CC 95 was also used. The DT A B spacer was comparably active with respect to the alternative breast tumor lines, but relatively inactive against the normal cells.
