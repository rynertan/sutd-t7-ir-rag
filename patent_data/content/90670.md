Figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the bracket of figure 1 showing securing members in operative rail clamping condition and illustrating the mounting of curtain rails on the bracket.Figure 3 is a top plan view of the bracket of figures 1 and 2.The bracket A comprises elongate holder member 1 which is integrally formed with mounting plates 2a, 2b which extend transversely to holder member 1 in opposite directions from one end of holder member 1. Mounting plates 2a, 2b are provided with apertures 3a, 3b respectively and are adapted to be secured to a wall or other suitable support not shown by means of screws or the like passing through apertures 3a, 3b.The free outward end of holder member 1 opposite to mounting plates 2a, 2b is bent downwardly to define a locating formation 4 against which an outwardly disposed curtain rail 5 may be located.Intermediate its ends, holder member 1 is integrally formed with a group of three longitudinally spaced sets of downwardly directed locating formations 6a, 6b, 6c against which an inwardly disposed curtain rail 7 may be located in any one of three alternative positions. Each set of locating formations 6a,.6b, 6c comprise a pair of transversely spaced protusions extending downwardly from opposite sides of the holder member l. An elongate longitudinally extending mounting slot 8 with an enlargement 9 and a single pair of aligned, transversely disposed locking slots 10 communicating with mounting slot 8, are provided through holder member 1 for the outward locating formation 4. An elongate, longitudinally. extending mounting slot 11 with an enlargement 12 and a pair of aligned, transversely disposed locking slots 13a, 13b, 13c for each of the inwardly located sets of locating formations 6a, 6b, 6c respectively, are provided through holder member 1 for the inward locating formations 6a, 6b, 6c.As best shown in figure 1, a securing member B comprises a body 14 from which an integral mounting protrusion 15 extends upwardly. A retaining enlargement 16 is provided at the free end of mounting protrusion 15. An inclined clamping formation 17 extends downwardly from one end of body 14 and a locking protrusion 18 extends upwardly from the opposite end of body 14.As shown in figure 2, a securing member B1 may be removably mounted on bracket A for outward curtain rail 5 by passing the retaining enlargement 16 of the securing member Bl through the enlargement 9 of the outward mounting slot 8 so that the mounting protrusion 15 extends through slot 8 and retaining enlargement 16 is located on the side of holder member 1 opposite to that on which body 14 is located. The mounting protrusion 15 is movably accommodated in slot 8 so that the securing member B1 is pivotable relative to holder member 1 between locked and unlocked conditions and is slidable along slot 8 towards and away from the outward locating formation 4 when the securing member B1 is in an unlocked condition. When retaining enlargement 16 is not in registration with slot enlargement 9, the retaining enlargement 16 engages the surrounds of mounting slot 8 and prevents removal of the securing member B1 from bracket A. The securing member B1 may be removed from bracket A by bringing retaining enlargement 16 into registration with slot enlargement 9 and withdrawing mounting protrusion 15 from bracket A. With securing member Bl mounted in mounting slot 8 and in an unlocked condition, rail 5 may be located against outward locating formation 4 as shown in figure 2 and the securing member B1 moved longitudinally along holder member 1 towards outward locating formation 4 until the clamping formation 17 of the securing member B1 engages rail 5. By pivotting the securing member B1 relative to holder member 1, the locking protrusion 18 may be urged upwardly into releasable engagement with locking slots 10 in holder member 1, thereby releasably to retain the securing member B1 in a locked condition in which it firmly clamps the rail 5 against locating formation 4 and cannot move away from rail 5 along mounting slot 8.The various parts and formations are suitably related to each other so that when the locking protrusion 18 of the securing member B1 is engaged in locking slots 10, rail 5 is securely held in position. It will be seen from figure 2 that the outward locating formation 4 and the clamping formation 17 of the securing member 131 converge downwardly towards each other when the securing memberB1 is in its locked condition and engage downwardly converging surfaces of rail 5 so that rail 5 is held securely against withdrawal from between clamping formation 17 and locating formation 4.In order to release rail 5, the securing member B1 may be pivotted relative to holder member 1 to move the locking protrusion 18 downwardly out of engagement with locking slots 10 so that securing member B1 is in an unlocked condition to permit movement of the securing member B1 longitudinally along holder member 1 away from outward locating formation 4.It may be necessary for the clamping components and or the region of rail 5 which is adapted to be clamped to possess some resilience to permit movement of the securing member B1 into and out of a locked condition.In similar manner to that described above, a securing member B2 may be removably mounted on bracket A for the inward curtain rail 7 by passing the retaining enlargement 16 of the securing member B2 through the enlargement 12 of the inward mounting slot 11 so that the mounting protrusion 15 extends through slot 11 and retaining enlargement 16 is located on the side of holder member 1 opposite to that on which the body 14 of the securing member B2 is located. securing member B2 is pivotable relative to holder member 1 between locked and unlocked conditions. Also, securing member B2 is slidably movable along mounting slot 11 towards and away from locating formations 6a, 6b, 6c when securing memberB2 is in an unlocked condition.Rail 7 may be mounted in any one of three alternative positions by locating rail 7 against any one of locating formations 6a, 6b, or 6c and moving the securing memberB2 into engagement with rail 7. Rail 7 may be firmly clamped in the required position by pivoting the securing member B2 relative to holder member 1 releasably to engage the locking protrusion 18 on the securing member B2 in the pair of locking slots 13a, 13b or 13c appropriate for the particular locating formation 6a, 6b or 6c against which rail 7 is located, thereby releasably to retain the securing member B2 in a locked condition in which it firmly clamps rail 7 against the locating formation 6a, 6b or 6c in question.It will be appreciated that instead of mounting the outward rail 5 against outward locating formation 4, it may also be mounted against locating formation 6b or 6c by mounting two securing members B on bracket A through the same mounting slot 11.It is also possible to mount only one curtain rail at a time on bracket A. As another alternative it is also possible to mount three or four rails on bracket A.Thus, a rail may be mounted against each of the four locating formations 6a, 6b, 6c and 4, a securing memberB being provided for each of the rails, three securing members B being mounted on bracket A through the same mounting slot 11 and a fourth securing member B being mounted on bracket A through slot 8.Many other variations in detail are possible without departing from the scope of the appended claims. For example, any suitable number of suitably spaced locating formations or sets of locating formations may be provided on holder member 1.In order to prevent a securing member B from snapping out of its locked condition due to vibration caused by the drawing and opening of a curtain, a hole 16a may be provided through the retaining enlargement 16 of the securing member B as shown in figure 1. As shown with respect to the securing member 131 in figure 2, a self tapping screw 19 may be passed through the mounting slot 8 from the bottom of holder member 1 and screwed into the hole 16a of the retaining enlargement until the head of screw 19 seats against the surrounds of slot 8 to hold securing member B1 against movement out of its locked condition. Holder member 1 may be adapted to be supported at both ends thereof.The rails 5 and 7 shown in figure 2 are of a type suitable for curtain runners of the type disclosed in co pending SA patent application No 82 8653 but any other suitable rails may be used.Bracket A and securing member B may each be of integral construction and may be pressed out of sheet metal.The invention includes within its scope a holder member as such as defined above and also a securing member as such as defined above.
