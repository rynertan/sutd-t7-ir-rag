# Improved catalysts and their use in ammonia production.

## Abstract
Catalysts as prepared by impregnating a carbon support with a halogen containing compound of Ru, reducing the Ru to metal with hydrogen, and then depositing an alkali metal and a barium compound. The catalysts may be used for ammonia production.
