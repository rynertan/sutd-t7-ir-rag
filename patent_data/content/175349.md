# VACUUM CIRCUIT BREAKER

## Abstract
A vacuum circuit breaker has a vaccum vessel 2 in which are disposed a pair of opposing electrodes 8, 9 so as to be moved into and out of contact with each other, each of the electrodes 8,9 being made of a material consisting essentially of a main component such as Cu, Ag or the like and a low melting point metal such as Bi, Pb, Te, Se or the like. A film 13 is formed on the surface of each electrode 8, 9 by, for example, evaporating a metal having a melting point equal to or higher than that of the main component of the electrode material.
