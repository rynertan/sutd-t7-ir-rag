# Semiconductor devices and method for producing the same.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor device comprising at least one bipolar transistor 45 and a VIP isolating layer 43 which are formed in both an epitaxial layer 33 and a semiconductor substrate 31 , an impurity introduced region 37 having the same conductivity type as that of the semiconductor substrate 31 is formed so as to surround the V groove 36 . A buried layer 32 of the bipolar transistor comes into contact with the VIP isolating layer 39,40 to divide the impurity intorduced region into two parts, one of which is combined with a base region 37 and the other one of which serves as a channel stopper 38 .
