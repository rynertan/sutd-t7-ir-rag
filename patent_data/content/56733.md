# Poultry feed system.

## Abstract
A feeder unit for automatic, multi tier animal feed systems, such as for poultry and the like, of the type having a plurality of conveyors 15 to which feed is supplied from a remote storage bin. The feeder unit has a low profile housing, and a mounting bracket which positions the conveyor drive motor alongside the housing to minimize the overall height of the feeder unit, so that the feeder units can be vertically stacked closely together for substantial space saving and efficiency. The housings include a passageway through a sidewall and a base thereof, in which a feed supply conduit 5 is inserted to transport feed from a remote storage bin into a hopper portion 8 of the feeder units.
