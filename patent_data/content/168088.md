# Apparatus for measuring the volume of a measuring gas.

## Abstract
An apparatus for ascertaining the volume of a measur ing gas comprising a bell 1 movable upwards and down wards under the influence of the measuring gas, and suspended at one end of a flexible cable 2 cooperating with a balancing device 10, 13 for the bell. The bell, together with a stationary body 3 , creates a measuring space 5 to which a conduit 4 for the measuring gas is connected. The balancing device is constructed in a manner such that it remains operational in a range of bell acceleratiors that exceed the gravitational acceleration. The balancing device consists of a counter weight 10 or a spring element 13 .
