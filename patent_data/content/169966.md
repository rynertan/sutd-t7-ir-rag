# Radiation image read out apparatus.

## Abstract
A radiation image read out apparatus comprises an optical system for scanning a stimulable phosphor sheet 3 carrying a radiation image stored therein by stimulating rays 1b , a light guide member 4 for guiding light emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet upon exposure to stimulating rays, and a photoelectric converter for detecting the guided light. A film 4a for preventing reflection of stimulating rays is closely contacted with a light input face of the light guide member. Or, a filter 15 for absorbing the stimulating rays reflected by the stimulable phosphor sheet and transmitting the light emitted by the stimulable phosphor sheet is positioned between the stimulating ray incidence point 3a on the stimulable phosphor sheet and the light input face of the light guide member.
