## Description
CASTING NOZZLE AND METHOD OF CASTING USING SAMEThe present invention relates to a nozzle for casting ultra low carbon steel. Amongst the various types of new steels which are of interest, an ultra low carbon steel has been proposed which contains less than 15 ppm carbon. As it is currently desirable to cast both killed steel and oxygen containing steel by the continuous casting process, a need has arisen for a casting nozzle suitable for casting ultra low carbon steels by the continuous casting process.As a consequence of the stringent quality requirements of modern steels, it has become necessary to use nozzles made of refractory materials which can ensure the continuous quality requirements described.We have found that if alumina graphite nozzles, which are used for casting conventional, carbon containing steels, are used for casting ultra low carbon steels.carbon pickup becomes apparent either as the nozzle is worn away by the molten steel or through decarburization of the nozzle itself. Thus, we have found that conventional alumina graphite nozzles are not suitable for use with ultra low carbon steels. Fused silica nozzles do not contain carbon. However, these nozzles are susceptible to wear, especially by high manganese steel.It is one object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the problems of carbon pickup and excessive wear and provide a nozzle suitable for the continuous casting of ultra low carbon steels. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a casting nozzle formed of a material comprising 70 to 98 weight of a refractory material other than carbon or graphite, and 2 to 30 weight of boron nitride.Preferably, the refractory material is selected from sintered or electrically fused magnesium, non stabilized or semi stabilized zirconia, alpha alumina, beta alumina, mullite, sillimanite, clay materials, fused silica, Si3N4, B4C and SiC.It is also preferable to add Si, Al or the like to the above composition to promote sintering and prevent oxidation of the nozzle material.Conveniently, an inorganic bonding agent is mixed with the composition, e.g in an amount of from 5 to 20 weight of the composition. For example, there may be used as an inorganic bonding agent, clay e.g.bentonite , waterglass, aluminium phosphate etc.Typically the nozzle of the present invention is made by moulding the present composition followed by sintering in a reducing atmosphere.If more than 30 boron nitride is used, then the nozzle is easily oxidized to B203 and wear of the nozzle is increased. If less than 28 boron nitride is used, the desirable characteristics of boron nitride, i.e.chemical inertness and high thermal conductivity are not shown and thermal shock spalling is increased.The present invention will be illustrated by the following examples all percentages are by weight in the composition excluding the inorganic bonding agent unless otherwise specified .Composition 1Boron Nitride 10 Fused Silica 20 Sintered Alumina 70 Bonding Agent clay 10 of the composition weightComposition 2Boron Nitride 15 Zircon 50 Zirconia 25 Si 5 B4C 5 Bonding Agent clay 15 of the composition weightComposition 3Boron Nitride 25 Electrically Fused Magnesia 20 Mullite 40 Zirconia 15 Bonding Agent bentonite 15 of the composition weightComposition 4Boron Nitride 2.1 beta A1203 RTI ID 3.18 30 Sillimanite 30 Si3N4 19.9 Fused Silica 18 Bonding Agent waterglass No.1 88 of the composition weight composition 5Boron Nitride 36 Electrically Fused Alumina 50 Electrically Fused Cordierite 148 f Bonding Agent clay 20 of the composition weightComparative ExampleBoron Nitride 45 Zirconia Mullite 408 5intered Alumina 15 Bonding Agent clay 26 of the composition weightThe respective compositions and bonding agents mentioned above are added with an appropriate amount of water and kneaded in a kneader for 40 minutes.
