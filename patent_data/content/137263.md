# OVERCURRENT DETECTION DEVICE

## Abstract
An overcurrent detection device protects a motor 11, 12 against currents above rated current that persist for certain exposure times. The allowable exposure times are inversely related to the degree of overload current. The device has two overload current sensors 21, 22 with two respective overload thresholds. These are both connected to a pulse generating circuit 23 to 27 and the pulse rate is accelerated when the second overload threshold is reached. The pulse generating circuit 23 to 27 couples pulses to a pair of cascaded counters 28 which generate a fault signal when a predetermined count is reached. The pulse generating circuit includes an integrator 24 with a capacitor 34 that must be discharged, before another pulse can be generated. The pulse generating circuit includes a comparator 27 which operates a switch 30 to discharge the capacitor shortly before coupling each pulse to the counters 28 , to prevent a delay that would otherwise occur between signals from the integrator circuit 24 .
