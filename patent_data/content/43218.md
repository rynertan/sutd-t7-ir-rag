# A vaginal speculum.

## Abstract
The invention overcomes the problem of excessive dilation of the introitus, and also permits the interior of the vagina to be dilated independently of the introitus. Essentially, the vaginal speculum 1 comprises an introitus engaging ring member 2 and a pair of vagina engaging members 3,4 of arcuate shape slidable through the ring member 2 . The introitus engaging ring member 2 is inserted into the introitus and the vagina engaging members 3,4 are moved through the ring member 2 in the direction of the arrow A. As the vagina engaging members 3,4 are moved through the ring member 2 into the vagina, ends 9 and 10 move apart, thereby dilating the interior of the vagina. In another embodiment of the invention the vagina engaging members 3,4 are pivotally connected 30, 31 to the introitus engaging ring member 2 .
