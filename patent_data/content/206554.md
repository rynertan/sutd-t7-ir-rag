# Electrolytic process for manufacturing pure potassium peroxydiphosphate.

## Abstract
The invention provides a process to manufacture fluoride free potassium peroxydiphosphate on a commercial scale. The process comprises electrolyzing an alkaline anolyte containing potassium, phosphate, nitrate and hydroxyl ions at a platinum or noble metal anode. The catholyte is separated from the anolyte by a separating means permeable to at least one ion contained in the anolyte or catholyte.
