# IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO APPARATUS, SYSTEM, METHOD AND DEVICE USED IN CUTTING ONE ELEMENT FROM A LEAF

## Abstract
There is provided an improvement in an apparatus for cutting a profile of a selected shape from a natural sheet material at a given location, which apparatus comprises a cutting platen having an upper generally flat cutting surface and a lower generally flat support surface. The platen is movable to the desired position relative to a cutter which moves along an axis downwardly against the cutting surface to cut the preselected shape from the natural material. In accordance with the improvement, there is provided a fixed anvil having a flat force reaction surface parallel to and facing the supporting surface of the platen so that the cutting action is against the anvil. The anvil can also form the structure for supporting the platen as it is moved into the cutting position. Also provided is a device for converting a succession of analog voltage signals representative of light intensity of light from and controlled by a corresponding succession of finite surface locations of a natural leaf into high or white, low or black and intermediate or grey digital signals. This device includes an arrangement for creating a white digital signal when the analog voltage of a given location exceeds the threshold voltage. The digital signals are continuously averaged and updated to provide a datum voltage against which the analog voltage is compared after the datum voltage is decreased by a preselected amount. If the analog voltage is less than the reduced datum voltage, a black digital signal is created. If there is neither a black nor a white digital signal, a grey digital signal is created. In this manner, the general light intensity characteristics of each successive location on the leaf can be recorded as either white, black or grey. The colour profile of the leaf could be created by these signals however, alternatively, a digital signal can be created when the light intensity signal shifts from one value to another. At that time, a transition signal is created which can be combined to form a transition profile of the leaf which is indicative of the actual profile and colour variations of the leaf itself. This information can be used for locating a wrapper cutter at the desired position on the leaf for subsequent cutting of the wrapper from the leaf. A device for cutting a piece of a flat workpiece at a selected location identifiable by two or more binary coded numbers which device includes a cutter, a cutting platen having an upper workpiece supporting surface and a lower portion, a plurality of upstanding, shiftable members, a guiding arrangement on the platen adjacent the lower portion for loosely receiving the members, an arrangement for moving the members in accordance with the coded numbers and a structure for forcing the cutter against the cutting surface. In accordance with another aspect, the shiftable members are movable by binary fluid motors each including a series of axially aligned fluid actuating units having strokes corresponding to binary numbers and an arrangement for actuating certain of these units in the fluid motor to move the shiftable members in accordance with the extended condition of the binary motors.
