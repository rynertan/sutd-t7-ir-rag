# ELECTROMAGNETIC ACTUATOR.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic actuator which controls the operation of a load such as a valve by utilizing the pressure of fluid driven by an electromagnetic pump. A driven member 17 is displaced by the pressure of the fluid fed from the first chamber 8 to the second chamber 9 by the pump 2 , thereby opening, closing or proportionally controlling a valve 22 connected to the member 17 , and the actuator can thus provide sufficiently large and effective operation for the load.
