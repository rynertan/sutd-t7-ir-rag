# Micro vector processor.

## Abstract
A micro vector processor has an input and output section 16 ,14 , a supervisor section 12, a plurality of vector unit sections, 17,18,19,20 and a memory 21, 22, 23, 24 common to all of the sections and accessible by each. The signals to be processed are supplied by the input section in digital form to the data memory unit. The supervisor section is programmable and acts as the overall micro vector processor control processor. The supervisor unit sets up, starts, and monitors the actual signal processors, the vector units. The supervisor orders the vector units to go to a reserve location in the data memory unit where they find the beginning address of a command parameter list CPL previously loaded into data memory by the supervisor unit, containing the name of, and the parameters for, the utility algorithm which the particular vector unit is to execute. The algorithms that the vector unit performs are contained in the form of micro instructions in a read only memory ROM which controls the operation of the vector units. The vector units send results to the data memory unit and informs the supervisor that its task has been completed. The results are sent from the data memory to the output section. The vector units, once started by the supervisor unit, are completely autonomous from the supervisor unit. The entire micro vector processor may be connected in an array with other micro vector processors to form a distributed signal processing system Fig. 2 .
