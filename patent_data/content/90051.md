# HEATING DEVICE WITH WEIGHING FUNCTION.

## Abstract
Heating device with a weighing function, which has a hinge 4 disposed at the lower front part of the front opening 2 of a heating chamber 1 , an openable door 3 rotating around the hinge 4 as a center, and a weight detector 11 detecting the weight of the material 20 being heated by converting the amount by which the hinge 4 of the door 3 is deformed by a load into an electric signal, and the weight of the material 2 placed on the door 3 is detected by the detector 11 when the door 3 is opened. Even if the ma terial 2 is placed at any position on the door 3 , the weight can be accurately detected, the weight of the material sub tracted from the weight of the container of the material can be measured by utilizing a microcomputer, and the heating operation can be controlled automatically according to the detected weight of the material.
