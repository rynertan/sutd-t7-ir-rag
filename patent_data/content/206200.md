## Description
The invention is in the field of the neurotransmitter hydrolyzing enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, EC 3,1.1.7, designated as AChE, which is a key element in cholinergic synapses and in neuromuscular junctions. Cholinesterases ChEs appear in different cell types, where they exist in multiple molecular forms. According to the invention, several types of cDNA and mRNA are provided which code for the main types of human ChE. Genetic engineering was used to provide sources for the large scale production of various ChE types. There are provided expression systems, capable of producing such ChE. A ChE thus made available, is of value in the treatment of organophosphorus OP poisoning, as antidote and for the treatment of patients poisoned by such poisonous substances. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes prepared according to the consensus hexapeptide sequence present in the organophosphate binding site of cholinesterases is provided. Such probes are used to select cDNA fragments containing such sequence from genetically engineered libraries of various sources. There are further provided bacterial colonies containing such cDNA fragments, inserted into suitable expression vectors. When suitably induced to produce the peptide encoded by the cloned DNA, these cells synthesize proteins immunoreactive with anti AChE antibodies. Thus identification of mammalian DNA sequences directly related to ChE biosynthesis was effected. Furthermore, the invention relates to protein having authentic ChE type catalytic activity. Such proteins are effective ingredients in succinylcholine and or organophosphorus anticote preparations. There are provided antibodies interacting with human AChE. At the cholinergic synapse, the enzyme acetylcholinesterase acetylcholine hydrolase, AChE, EC 3.1.1.7 terminates the electrophysiological response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ACh by degrading it very rapidly. For a review see Silver, A., The Biology of Cholinesterases. North Holland Pub. Co., Amsterdam 1974 . Mammmalian cholinesterases ChEs exhibit extensive polymorphism at several levels. They can be distinguished by substrate specificity into acetylcholinesterase acetylcholine hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.7, AChE and pseudocholinesterase acylcholine acylhydrolase, EC 3.1.1.8, ψChE . They differ in their susceptibility to various inhibitors. Both are composed of subunits of ca.600 amino acid residues each, and are glycosylated 10 20 . ChEs occur in multiple molecular forms, which exhibit different sedimentation coefficients on sucrose gradients, display different hydrodynamic interactions with non ionic detergents and are composed of different numbers of subunits. For a comprehensive review see Massoulie, J. and Bon, S., Ann. Rev. Neurosci. There are secreted, cytoplasmic and membrane associated pools of ChEs in the mammalian nervous tissue, but all forms of ChEs possess similar catalytic properties, suggesting that they share common acetylcholine binding sites Chubb, I.W., In Cholinesterases Fundamental and Applied Aspects. M. Brzin, E.A. Barnard and D. Sket, Eds. pp. 345 359, 1984 . But various ChEs may also contain distinct polypeptide regions, responsible for the subcellular segregation of various AChE forms, for their different amphipathic properties and for their different modes of assembly into multisubunit protein molecules. This is supported by the reports of antibodies which display homologies Fambrough et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Most of the commonly used insecticides are organophosphorus OP compounds, acting by blocking the insect s AChE. In many cases where such insects develop insensitivity to the insecticides, this occurs because of the enhanced expression of AChE forms which do not interact with the organophosphate. To deal with such phenomenae successfully, it is necessary to know the mechanisms by which the appearance of such AChE forms is regulated. Complete inhibition of mamalian AChE i.e., by administration of OP poisons is lethal, due to the formation of a stable stoichiometric 1 1 covalent conjugate with the active site serine. Treatment of OP poisoning has involved the use of reversible ChE inhibitors, and reactivation of the inhibited enzyme with active site directed nucleophiles e.g., quaternary oximes which detach the phosphoryl moiety from the hydroxyl group of the active site serine. A parallel competing reaction, termed aging , transforms the inhibited ChE into a form that cannot be regenerated by the commonly used reactivators by dealkylation of the covalently bound OP group, and renders therapy of intoxication by certain organophosphates, such as Sarin, DFP, and Soman, exceedingly difficult National Academy of Sciences Report, 1982 . Pseudocholinesterase ψChE is particularly enriched in the serum. Subjects with null ψChE Activity i.e., samples of their serum cannot hydrolyze acetylcholine do not exhibit any health problem under natural conditions, but suffer from prolonged apnea when they are given succinylcholine a drug commonly used as a short acting muscle relaxant in surgical operation. However, there are no rapid, simple, routine methods to detect and characterize the atypic forms of the enzyme prior to surgery. The amino acid sequence of human AChE is not known. It has recently been found that the same 6 amino acids are included in the organophosphorous binding site of both The amino acid sequence in this hexapeptide from the organophosphate binding site of ChEs has been determined recently in several laboratories, by partial proteolytic digestion of the purified enzymes, labeled with ³H diisopropylfluorophosphate, and was found to be Gly Glu Ser Ala Gly Ala, with the serine residue bound to organophosphates. It has been suggested that the null forms ψChE are modified in this peptide. Modifications in both the level Spokes, E.G.S., Brain Individuals with Down s syndrome invariably develop SDAT manifestations before the age of 40. In addition open neural tube defects in human embryos are clinically characterized by secretion of AChE tetramers into the amniotic fluid. Current tests for these phenomenae include sucrose gradient fractionation, followed by enzymatic assays of substrate hydrolysis or gel electrophoresis and AChE activity staining. Missing, and particularly desirable, are simple selective procedures to determine the level of specific AChE forms. Homozygote The present invention relates to genetically engineered AChE like enzymatically active peptides. More particularly the invention relates to such peptides which react with polyclonal and monoclonal acetylcholinesterase specific antibodies. The invention furthermore relates to cDNA coding for a genetically engineered protein defined above, to expression systems as well as to mRNA coding for mammalian ChE in a synthetic form. The cDNAs contain nucleotide sequences as herein defined the invention further relates to fragments of a human cholinesterase gene containing the nucleotide sequences coding for human cholinesterases and to such fragments cloned in an expression vector such as a suitable phage, Charon 4A phage or the like. Phage FBChE 12a λgt10 and plasmid FBChEpEX 12a were deposited with the Culture Collection of Institute Pasteur, Paris, France under Deposit No. I 534 and I 552, respectively, with instructions complying with those required for a patent application. Other and further features of the invention will become apparent from the following description. Amongst applications of the products of the invention there may be mentioned To identify the mRNA species coding for human ChEs, we developed the use of microinjected Injection of mRNA from different ChE expressing sources into these oocytes produces ChE activities Soreq, H. Determination of ChE mRNA levels in the oocytes was proven to be time and concentration dependent and the enzyme produced from brain poly A RNA was biochemically defined as true mammalian AChE. When the concentration of ChE mRNA out of total poly A RNA was calculated, it yielded values of about 1x10 ⁵ of total mRNA. Soreq et al., ibid. 1984 . Sucrose gradient fractionation of DMSO denatured mRNA from primary gliomas, meningiomas and embryonic brain revealed three size classses of ChE inducing mRNAs, sedimenting at 32S, 20S and 9S. The amounts of these different classes of ChE inducing mRNAs varied between the three tissue sources examined. To distinguish between ChEs produced in occytes and having different substrate specificities, their activity was determined in the presence of selective inhibitors. Both AChE and ψChE multimeric cholinesterase activities were found in the mRNA injected oocytes. Moreover, human brain mRNAs inducing true and pseudo ChE activities had different size distribution, indicating that different mRNAs might be translated into various types of ChEs. These findings imply that the heterogeneity of ChEs in the human nervous system is not limited to the post translational level, but extends to the level of mRNA. Furthermore, the composition of ChE mRNAs appears to be different in various brain cell types, and the production of the differently migrating ChE molecular forms thus seems to be controlled at least partially at the level of mRNA. To ensure a complete representation of all of the ChE mRNA sequences in different cell types in the brain, it was necessary to prepare the cDNA library from the entire brain. Therefore, we could not take advantage of the fact that particular brain regions are highly enriched with AChE. Our mRNA preparation of choice was, therefore, total, unfractionated poly A mRNA from human fetal brain. To focus on the particular DNA sequences which actually code for the ChE proteins, it was decided to search for probes of high specificity and selectivity. Such properties could be offered by synthetic short oligonucleotides, prepared according to amino acid sequence s that are unique to cholinesterases. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides have been shown to hybridize specifically to complementary DNA sequences Wallace, R.B. This technique has been applied to the successful isolation of cDNAs coding for human beta₂ macroglobulin, for murine transplantation antigen, for human apolipoprotein and many others. The consensus hexapeptide sequence from the organophosphate binding site of ChEs designated OPSYN is Phe Gly Glu Ser Ala Gly. Because of the ambiguity in the genetic code, this peptide could be encoded by one out of 384 different oligonucleotides, as follows Three mixtures of these oligodeoxynucleotides, each containing 128 different chains of 17 nucleotides each, designated OPSYN, were prepared by solid phase synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry Beaucage et al., Tetra. Lett. This procedure ensured the presence, in the mixture, of roughly equal amounts of each of its components. The oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 20 acrylamide, 7 M urea , followed by Sephadex G 50 chromatography. The OPSYN probes happen to be particularly rich in guanosine and cytosine residues. We therefore carried out the hybridization with thses probes at 40 Following the third screening step, 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride CH₃ ₄NCl was employed to discriminate against short, GC rich hybrids in a base composition independent manner Wood et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci, U.S.A. To increase the certainty of our search, we prepared an additional oligodeoxynucleotide probe. This probe, designated OPSYNO, consisted of a mixture of thirty six oligodeoxynucleotides, each 29 nucleotides long. These encoded a decapeptide comprising the same hexapeptide as the OPSYN probes and 4 additional amino acids, Ala Ala Ser Val, as reported for the continuation of this peptide in human serum ψChE Lockeridge, O Cholinesterases Fundamental and Applied Aspects edited Brzin et al., pp5 12 1984 . To limit the complexity of this probe and ensure that the correct oligodeoxynucleotide would be present in sufficient specific activity, we inserted deoxyinosine in every position where all four nucleotides might be found. Deoxyinosine, being an inert nucleotide, is expected either to hybridize with A, C or T or at least not to interfere with the stability of hybridization Takahashi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. Altogether, four screening experiments were performed these resulted in the isolation of 8 CH₃ ₄NCl stable OPSYN positives, out of which only a single clone hybridized with OPSYNO as well. Furthermore, the hybridization signals displayed by this clone with both OPSYN I and II and OPSYNO were the only ones that remained stable to 3 M CH₃ ₄NCl washes. The isolated cDNA insert, designated FBChEl2, consisted of 765 nucleotides with an open reading frame sufficient to code for about half of the subunit size of human cholinesterase Lockridge, ibid. 1984 . The nucleotide sequence of FBChEl2 that is complementary to probes OPSYN and OPSYNO corresponded exactly to the peptide sequence used to design these oligodeoxynucleotide probes. When the amino acids predicted from FBChEl2 sequence are aligned with the available peptide sequences published for human ψChE, about half of the coding region for the mature enzyme is defined, starting at residue 1 nucleotide 187 , which corresponds to the N terminal peptide, and ending at residue 202, which is included in the active site tryptic peptide of ψChE as determined from amino acid sequencing. The sequence includes the active site serine, which can be labeled by diisopropylfluorophosphate Lockridge, ibid. 1984 . The N terminal peptide inferred by the FBChEl2 sequence is similar to the ψChE peptide, except that in our sequence residue 12 is Lys, as in the N terminal peptide of The region upstream of the ψChE amino terminal residue nucleotides 115 187 in FBChEl2 codes for 20 amino acids characteristic of leader peptides of membrane associated and exported protein precursors. The hydrophobic sequence in this region is rich in large nonpolar amino acids. It is preceded by the tripeptide His Ser Lys, and terminates with Lys Ser His, both composed of polar amino acids. Further upstream, the cDNA sequence consists of a fully open reading frame without stop codons and includes two methionine residues. The DNA and inferred amino acid sequence of the FBChEl2 clone were compared to the parallel sequences recently published for a cDNA clone coding for AChE from For direct characterization of the protein encoded by FBChEl2, the cDNA insert was subcloned into the pEX bacterial expression vector in conjunction with the gene coding for β galactosidase. Induction of pEX expression resulted in the production of two polypeptides, of 90 and 40 kilodalton, which reacted with anti β galactosdidase antibodies, while the synthesis of intact β galactosidase 117 kilodalton ceased almost completely. The 40 kd polypeptide, but not the 90 kd one, interacted specifically in protein blots with antibodies against both human erythrocyte and The bacterial produced protein encoded in pEX vector by this human ChE cDNA was purified by preparative gradient gel elecrophoresis, electroelution and lyophilization and was injected into rabbits together with complete Freund s adjuvant. Rabbit serum was prepared following three successive injections of 300 ug of this protein at two week intervals. Immunoblot analysis revealed that this serum contains antibodies that interact at 1 10,000 diltuion with amounts as low as 20 ng of highly purified 70 Kd AChE from erythrocytes. It also interacted with proteins of ca. 90 Kd in extracts from fetal brain and liver, both rich in AChE, and of ca. 60 Kd in fetal muscle and liver, both rich in ψChE. Antibodies to Human Cholinesterases Elicited by Bacterial Expressed Products of Human Cholinesterase cDNA, Soreq et al., Abst. Neurosci. Soc., in press 1986 . This antiserum can be employed for a clinical assay for determining changes in the levels and properties of ChEs such as in Alzheimer s disease patients. To study the Two of these were partial fragments included in FBChEl2 and the third displayed only partial sequence homology with the original cDNA clone. This analysis emphasizes the scarcity of cholinesterase cDNA clones in the cDNA library. The levels of the mRNAs coding for particular types of cholinesterase in fetal brain and liver were analyzed in parallel by mRNA microinjection into Considerable production of iso OMPA insensitive AChE was observed in oocytes injected with either fetal brain of liver RNA but not with HEpRNA. In contrast, only liver mRNA was capable of producing significant levels of BW284C51 insensitive ψChE. Thus, the pattern revealed in the RNA blot hybridization is compatible with the levels of AChE mRNA, or with both species of cholinesterase mRNA together, but not with pseudo ChE mRNA alone. The genomic DNA origin of FBChEl2 was examined by DNA blot hybridization. ³²P labeled FBChEl2 hybridized with two human DNA fragments derived by restriction with EcoRI, 4.7 and 2.5 kb in length. Taking into account the existence of an internal EcoRI site in the original FBChEl2 cDNA clone, and comparing the signal intensity observed with 20 µg of genomic DNA to that detected with 1.0 ng of λgt10 FBChEl2, this analysis indicates that the DNA sequences hybridizing with FBChEl2 are not present in the human genome in many copies. Parallel analysis of mouse DNA revealed a significant but not intense hybridization, suggesting the existence of homologous cholinesterase DNA sequences in other mammalian species. Accordingly there is also provided a clone designated as FBChE12a which has the translated sequence The FBChEl2 clone was further employed as a probe, to search for similar sequences in cDNA libraries derived from other tissue origins. Several such clones were thus isolated from a fetal liver cDNA library and from a primary glioblastoma cDNA library, cloned in λgt10 phages. The full length sequence of the fetal human cholinesterase was deduced from these clones, as presented in the following FChE scheme. The FChE sequence includes the exact N terminus, active site and C terminus peptides published for human ψChE Lockridge, ibid. 1984 . In Northern and Southern Gel hybridizations, it yields the same results as FBChEl2. When used as a probe to screen a genomic DNA library in Charon 4A prepared with partial Hoe 3 digestion, it hybridized with 5 positive phages. Clones FBChEl2 and FChE currently serve for further screens of our cDNA libraries, aimed to isolate additional cholinesterase cDNA clones and determine the full amino acid sequence of other human cholinesterases. In addition, it will be used for studies of the organization, structure and regulation of the human gene s coding for cholinesterases, as well as their mRNA transcripts and protein products. When inserted into suitable expression vectors the above defined cDNA can direct the production of authentic human ChE with catalytic activity. The ChE thus produced can interact with OP poisons and succinylcholine. Such ChE should be highly effective as antidote against the above compounds. Eukaryotic cells containing such constructs are suited for the large scale production of catalytically active ChE type products.
