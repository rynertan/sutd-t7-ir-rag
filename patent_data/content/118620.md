# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HEAT TREATING PILE FABRICS

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for heat treating a pile fabric, which comprises adding a dielectric material to the pile of the fabric and then dielectrically heating the fabric under a condition such that the movement of individual pile fibers is subtantially constrained by the presence of the dielectric material. Also, apparatus for carrying out the process is disclosed, which comprises means for dressing dielectric soaked fibers of a pile fabric, means for conveying the fabric while keeping the dressed pile fibers substantially intact, and a chamber in which the conveyed pile fabric is subjected to electromagnetic irradiation.
