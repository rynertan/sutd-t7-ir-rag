## Description
SYNTHESIS OF SUBSTITUTED 1,3 DIOXANESBACKGROUND Derivatives of 1,3 dioxanes, such as 5 amino 4 phenyl 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxane, have utility in the preparation of optically active amino acids and alpha methyl amino acids, eg, the antihypertensive drug alpha methyl Dopa. Traditional methods of making such dioxane derivatives have involved low reaction yields and generally unworkable reaction schemes. One well known scheme involvesEMI1.1 This reaction can not be efficiently scaled up due to large acetone requirements, problems with disposal of H3P04 residues, and the need for purification of the product prior to further use. Chemical Abstracts paragraphs 52 208i and 59 5175d, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference, illustrate this type of reaction.THE INVENTION It has been discovered that the cyclization of alpha, gamma dihydroxy beta amino substituted compounds to yield 2,2 di substituted, 5 amino 1,3 dioxanes can be carried out in a one pot reaction process involving three steps. Generally, the process comprises the steps of 1 reacting at least one compound of formula IEMI1.2 with at least one compound of formula II EMI2.1 under suitable conditions to produce at least one compound of formula IIIEMI2.2 wherein R1 through R5 are independently selected from hydrogen and C1 6 organic moieties, and R6 is a C16 alkyl or aryl moiety 2 reacting the product of step 1 under suitable conditions with at least one compound of formula IVEMI2.3 in the presence of at least one compound of formulaV R9 a C OR10 b V . to produce at least one compound of formula VIEMI3.1 wherein R7, R8 and R9 and R10 are the same as R6, and the sum of a and b is 4 and 3 contacting the product of step 2 with hydrazine under suitable conditions to yield at least one compound of formula VIIEMI3.2 Optionally, the products made using the above scheme can then be treated via the method disclosed in an article by K. Weinges, G. Graab, D. Nagel, andB. Stemmle, at Chem. Berichte, 104, 3594 3606 1971 to yield pharmaceutically active materials, eg. alphamethyl Dopa. The disclosure of that article is hereby incorporated by reference. In a preferred embodiment, l phenyl, 2 aminopropane 1,3 diol is contacted with methyl formate in methanol solution to yield the N formyl derivative of the starting diol. To that derivative is added HBr, 2,2 dimethoxypropane, and acetone to produce 2,2dimethyl, 4 phenyl, 5 formylamino 1,3 dioxane.Reaction of that product with hydrazine hydrate in water gives about a 78 yield of 5 amino 4 phenyl 2,2dimethyl 1,3 dioxane. The use of the N acetyl protecting group instead of the N formyl group gives yields of about 70 .However, the hydrazinolysis step took 60 or more hours to complete. One aspect of the invention deals with the preparation of substituted 1,3 dioxanes. Another aspect of the invention is concerned with producing chemical intermediates from which biologically or pharmaceutically active substances can be made.ADVANTAGES The process of the invention has several advantages over known processes for producing substituted 1,3 dioxanes of the types described herein. Generally, the subject process is faster and simpler than known processes, but produces dioxanes in good yields. It is this speed, simplicity, and efficiency which results in relative ease of commercial scale up. The process can be considered a onepot scheme, which results in products which are suitably pure for many purposes without distillation. Other aspects and advantages of the invention can be ascertained from a consideration of the following description.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention involves the preparation of 1,3dioxanes having chemical structures rendering them useful per se or useful as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds, eg, antihypertensive substances, such as L alpha methyl Dopa. The substituted 1,3 dioxanes made in accordance with the principal reactions described herein can be further reacted to yield biologically active substances, eg., alpha methyl Dopa or other alpha methyl amino acids. Suitable reactions for the production of such substances are described by K. Weinges and B.Stemmle Chem. Berichte, 106, 2291 2297 1973 K. Weinges, G. Graab, D. Nagel, and B. Stemmle, Chem.Berichte, 104, 3594 3606 1971 and K. Weinges,G. Brune, and H. Driste, Annalen, 1980, 212 218, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Stated broadly, the invention deals with a three step process for the cyclization of substituted alpha ,gamma dihydroxy, beta amino compounds. The three steps can be represented as follows Step 1EMI5.1 Step 2EMI6.1 Step 3EMI6.2 In these equations, R1 through R5 are independently selected from H, C1 6 alkyl, and aryl oieties and R6 through R10 are C16 alkyl groups, preferably methyl groups In these reactions, R1, 2 , R3, R4 , and R5 are each, independently a hydrogen or a C16 organic moiety.Without being limited thereto, the organic moiety may be a C1,6, straight or branched, alkyl radical optionally substituted or an aryl radical, which may be mono or bi cyclic and which may be substituted or unsubstituted for example substituted or unsubstituted benzyl or naphthyl, preferably substituted or unsubstituted benzyl. R 6 is chosen from C16 alkyl, straight or branched, moieties, C16 alkanoyl, straight or branched moieties and aryl moieties.These alkyl, alkanoyl and aryl moieties may optionally be substituted and the aryl radical may be a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl or naphthyl radical. 6.Preferably R is a methyl radical or an acetyl radical, most preferably a methyl radical. R 7, R8 R 9 and R 10 are chosen from C1,6, straight or branched, alkyl radicals which may optionally be substituted and aryl moieties mono or bi cyclic, unsubstituted or substituted . Suitable amine reactants for step 1 comprise alpha, gamma dihydroxy beta amino compounds of the formula shown above. Further substituted reactants, such as 1 phenyl ,2 amino,l,3 propane diol are also operable. Mixtures of such compounds can be used. Step 1 involves the introduction into the amine molecule of a group which shields or protects the nitrogen atom therein from undesireable side reactions. Typically, protecting groups are carbonyl containing substances and other reagents whose reaction with the nitrogen atom leave N C linkages which are not readily attached during subsequent intermediate reactions in the cyclization scheme. The protecting groups should be removable by hydrolysis or other suitable reaction, following production of the desired 1,3 dioxanes. Thus, the other class of reactants.useful in step 1 are typically carbonyl containing compounds which supply protecting groups. Generally, they are anhydrides, esters, or their functional equivalents.Useful carbonyl containing reactants include alkyl acylates, acetic anhydride and the like. Carboxylcontaining compounds are preferred. One highly preferred carboxyl containing reactant is methyl formate.Mixtures of such reactants are operable. It is generally preferred that step 1 be carried out in the presence of at least one diluent.While aromatic diluents, e.g., toluene, and combinations of aromatics with hydroxyl containing diluents are operable, it is highly preferred that C18 alkanols, such as ethanol, propanol, octanol, and the like, and mixtures thereof, be employed. Methanol is particularly preferred. The product of step l ie., the N acyl derivative of the dihydroxy amino reactant for step l is then contacted with at least two reagents. One is at least one carbonyl containing species. The other is at least one ketal or acetal species. The carbonyl containing species useful in step 2 generally supplies the carbon atom in the number 2 position of the 1,3 dioxanes i.e., it is the source of the protecting group. Preferred species include one or more of the aldehydes and ketones conforming to the general formula given above. Suitable carbonylcontaining substances include cyclic aldehydes and ketones, eg., non cyclic species, eg., dimethyl ketone, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Dimethyl ketone is highly preferred. The other reactant s used in step 2 generally comprise at least one compound of the general formula R9 aC OR10 b. Useful compounds include those reagents useful as water scavengers, which reagents do not cause deleterious side reactions. 2,2 dimethoxypropane is a highly preferred reagent. Mixtures of such reagents are operable. The product of step 2 ie., the 5 N acyl substituted 2,2 di substituted 1,3 dioxane is then contacted, in step 3, with hydrazine or other suitable reagent to remove the N substituent and leave an amino group.Other suitable agents and combinations of agents include hydrolyzing agent s such as KOH,H2O NaOH,H2O KOH, ethylene glycol and the like, and mixtures thereof. When hydrazine is used, it is generally preferred that it be in a hydrated form.REACTION CONDITIONS The conditions under which reaction steps 1,2, and 3 should be carried out can be derived from various considerations, such as the type of reaction vessel, properties of the reactants, etc. Generally, reaction temperatures for the three steps will conform to the parameters given in the following table Temperature Range OC Step Broad Preferred 1 20 50 10 30 2 20 50 5 30 3 50 150 80 120 Reasonable extrapolation from these temperatures, as well as the use of suitable pressures, etc. are within the purview of the skilled artisan.SUBSEQUENT REACTIONS The product of step 3 is an amino substituted 1,3dioxane. Such compounds are known to be intermediates in the synthesis of such compounds as optically active amino acids and alpha methyl amino acids. Alpha methylDopa,EMI10.1 is one pharmaceutically active compound which can be made using the products of the instant process as intermediates. The production of alpha methyl Dopa can be carried out under suitable conditions via the processes discussed above. Suitable recovery techniques, such as extraction and distillation, can be used during and or after the three steps outlined herein. The invention can be better understood from a consideration of the following example.EXAMPLE All solvents and reagents are commercially obtained with no further purification. 2 Amino lphenyl 1,3 propanediol was obtained from QuimicaSintetica, S.A., Madrid. To a 250 ml flask was added 5.09 0.0299 mol of l phenyl 2 amino 1,3 propane diol, 25 ml of methanol, and 19 ml 0.308 mol of methyl formate. The mixture was stirred for 3.5 hrs, then the solvent was evaporated. To the crystalline residue was added 75 ml of acetone, 8 ml of 2,2 dimethoxypropane, and 2.0 ml of 1.0 M HBr in methanol . This mixture was stirred in an ice water bath for 2.5 hours and the solvents were evaporated. To the viscous residue was added 25 ml of 85 H2NNH2 H20 and the mixture was ref fluxed for 1 hr.The cooled mixture was extracted with 3 25 ml portions of toluene. The toluene phase was washed with 10 ml ofH20, dried Na2S04 and evaporated to give 4.8 g 78 of a yellow oil, 5 amino 4 phenyl 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 d ioxane. Reasonable variations, such as those which would occur to a skilled artisan, can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention.
