## Description
Apparatus for the Separation of Mixtures of Materials of Different Consistencies such as Meat and BoneField of the Invention The present invention is concerned with apparatus for the separation of mechanical mixtures of materials of different consistencies, such as a mixture of meat and bone, or a mixture of water and solid material such as sewage.Review of the Prior Art Processes and apparatus for the separation of mixtures of materials of different consistencies into component parts are employed in many different industries. For example, in sewage treatment it is necessary at some stage to separate as much as possible of the liquid components of the sewage from the various more solid components, so that they can be subjected separately to appropriate treatments.The presence of the solid components causes considerable difficulty in the handling of the mixtures prior to their separation. The mechanical separation of mixtures of meat and bone into separate components is now a well established industry. Although usually the machines were proposed for use with different animal and fish species, in practice the earlier machines were operable most successfully with chicken parts, where the difference in consistencies between the meat and the bone is adequate, but the bones are not too difficult to break without splintering and powdering. Attempts to use the machines with other meats, such as beef, pork and fish, were not as successful.Even with chicken, problems were and still are encountered when attempting to obtain maximum production from a machine, such as too much bone content in the meat fraction, beyond the limits permitted by the licensing authorities, or too great a temperature increase in the meat fraction during separation, resulting in lowering in quality and texture of the separated meat. A separating apparatus that proved particularly commercially successful is described in U.S. PatentSpecifications Serial No. 4,025,001 and 4,069,980, issued respectively 24th May 1977 and 24th January 1978, while a subsequent machine is described in U.S.Patent Specification Serial No. 4,340,184, issued 20th July 1982.Definition of the Invention It is the principal object of the invention to provide a new apparatus for the separation of mixtures of materials of different consistencies, such as mixtures of meat and bone. In accordance with the present invention there is provided apparatus for the separation of mixtures of materials of different consistencies into separate fractions thereof comprising an apparatus body having an inlet for the mixture to be separated and respective outlets for the separated fractions, positive displacement pump means having a pump chamber mounted by the said body receiving the mixture from the inlet into the pump chamber and pressurising it in the pump chamber to an operative separation pressure, separator screen means mounted by the said body against a front face of which the pressurised mixture is delivered for the corresponding first fraction thereof to pass through the screen to a rear face thereof and for the remaining second fraction to be retained by the screen, and means connecting at least one of the front and rear faces of the screen to the respective outlet for the respective separated fractions. Description of the Drawings Separators which are particular preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal cross section through a first embodiment, in which a positive displacement pump feeds the mixture to be separated to a separate, attached separating unit FIGURE 2 is a similar cross section, to a larger scale, through the positive displacement pump of the separator of Figure 1, in order to show the construction thereof, taken on the line 2 2 in Figure 3 FIGURE 3 is a plane cross section taken on the line 3 3 in Figure 2 FIGURE 3A is a plane cross section of a detail of a vane of the pump of Figures 2 and 3, taken on the line 3A 3A of Figure 3 FIGURE 4 is a longitudinal cross section through a second embodiment, in which the separating unit is an integral part of the positive displacement pump, the section being taken on the line 4 4 inFigure 5 FIGURE 5 is a transverse cross section of the embodiment of Figure 4, taken on the line 5 5 inFigure 4 FIGURE 6 is a longitudinal cross section through a third embodiment, again in which the separating unit is an integral part of the positive displacement pump, the section being taken on the line 6 6 in Figure 7 FIGURE 7 is a transverse cross section taken on the line 7 7 in Figure 6 FIGURE 8 is a front elevation of a separator element for use in the embodiments of Figures 4 through 7 FIGURES 9 and 10 are respective side elevations of two different groups of separator elements for use in the embodiments of Figures 4 through 7 FIGURES 11 and 12 are respective front elevations of portions of a unitary separator element for use in the embodiments of Figures 4 through 7 FIGURE 13 is an outline diagram of the internal cam face of the positive displacement pump in side elevation and a rotor blade to accompany a description of a manner of calculating the cam face profile to permit its manufacture. FIGURE 14 is a longitudinal cross section similar to Figure 1 through a fourth embodiment and FIGURES 15 and 16 are perspective views respectively of two further forms of separator element for use in the embodiments of Figures 1 and 14. The same references will be used if possible for similar parts in all the figures of the drawings.Description of the Preferred Embodiments The apparatus of Figures 1 through 3A is intended principally for the mechanical separation of various kinds of meats from the bones to which they are attached. A substantial industry has developed, based on the use of such machines, since they are able economically to remove a substantial proportion of edible meat from fowl, animal and fish parts that would otherwise be discarded for food purposes, such as the necks and backs of chickens that have been cut in pieces for separate sale of the legs, breasts and wings. In practice the separation cannot be complete and the separated bone fraction will still contain some meat, while the separated meat fraction will also contain a small amount of bone in the form of tiny particles thereof.Food licensing authorities have instituted strict regulations as to the maximum overall percentage of bone and maximum particle size of the bone that is permitted in the resultant meat products. For example, the regulations of the U.S.Food and Drug Administration permit a maximum bone content of 2 by weight and a maximum bone particle size of 0.5 mm. These standards are difficult to achieve. The apparatus consists of a frame 10 providing a hopper 12 into which the meat and bone mixture to be separated is delivered. The hopper contains a longitudinal conveyor screw 14 rotated about a horizontal axis by a drive rotor not shown via a connecting drive gear 16 and a splined drive output shaft 18 mounted in a bearing 20 in an end plate of the frame. Special bearing seals such as 22 are required, as is well known to those skilled in the art of food handling machinery construction, to prevent entry to the bearings of the body fluids that accompany meats. The hopper body is provided with a front end flange 24 to which is fastened the adjacent rear end mounting flange 26 of a rotary, radial vane, positive displacement pump indicated generally by the reference 28. Referring now especially to Figures 2, 3 and 3A, the pump comprises a cylindrical housing 30 having the rear mounting flange 27 at one end and a comparable front mounting flange 32 at the other end. Front and rear bearing plates 34 and 36 respectively are mounted in the cylindrical housing on either side of a hollow cam plate 38, so as to form the pump chamber between them. The pump rotor is provided with two cylindrical plain bearing portions 40 and 42 that are mounted in respective bores in the bearing plates to support the rotor for rotation about a horizontal axis coaxial with the axis of rotation of the hopper conveyor screw 14. Both ends of the pump rotor protrude from the respective bearing plates and are splined, the rear rotor end 44 engaging in the adjacent end of the conveyor screw 14 to be driven thereby, while the front rotor end 46 engages in the rear end of another conveyor screw to be described below. The asembly of end plates, cam plate and rotor is retained in the housing by a retainer ring 48 screw threaded into the front end of the housing 30. A circumferentially elongated axial inlet 50 to the pump chamber is provided in the rear end plate 36 and a cicumferentially elongated axial outlet 52 is provided in the front end plate 34, the two openings being disposed diametrically opposed from one another about the axis of rotation of the rotor. The pump has two radially extending pump vanes or blades 54a and 54b each sliding radially in a respective radial slot in the rotor boss 56, the two slots and therefore the two blades being disposed at right angles to one another. Both blades are of an axial width to fit without appreciable play between the two facing axial faces of the end bearing plates, and they are both provided with mating complementary half width radially elongated slots 58a and 58b respectively to permit the required radial sliding movements in the rotor boss as it rotates about the axis 58.The tips 60 of the blades engage an internal cam constituted by the inside surface 62 of the bore in the hollow cam plate 38, the tips being rounded to facilitate the rubbing contact as they move over the surface. The surface 62 is generated so that at all times during the rotation of the pump rotor the blade tips are in contact with it, so that the contents of the pump chamber are positively displaced through the pump from the inlet to the outlet, and relatively high pump pressures, e.g.usually from 70 210 Kg sq. cm 1000 3000 p.s.i. , can readily be generated. The manner in which such a cam surface is determined is described below. The leading edges of the pump blades adjacent to the rear bearing plate 36 are hollow ground at 64 Figure 3A and hardened to form cutting edges 66.The trailing edge of the inlet 50 is also provided at 68 with a shearing edge that will cooperate with the vane cutting edges 66 to shear any hard material, such as a piece of bone, that protrudes through the inlet 40 into the pump chamber. The bone pieces are moved by the respective blade through the pump chamber and out through the outlet 52. If the bone piece jams in the outlet it will be sheared against the outlet trailing edge 68 by the following blade, the sheared off piece being carried around until it can be expelled at a subsequent passage of the blade over the outlet. The mixture of meat and bone pieces is fed from the outlet 52 into a separator chamber indicated generally by the reference 70 Figure 1 . In this embodiment this chamber is constituted by a rear end plate 72 that is secured to the pump front end plate 34 by a circumferential clamp ring 74. The separator chamber provides a cylindrical separator or filter constituted by a large plurality of annular separator plates 76 that are tightly clamped together between the rear end plate 72 and a front end plate 78 by a number of heavy axial circumferentially spaced tie bolts 80. The separator plates are held aligned with one another to provide a smooth internal cylindrical front face 81 by axial aligning bars 82 engaged in radial slots in the plates.The chamber encloses an elongated feed screw 84 mounted by splined front rotor end 46 and a bearing 86 for rotation about an axis coaxial with the pump axis 58, and driven in such rotation by the rotor end 46. Rotation of the screw 84 conveys the pump pressurised mixture of meat and bone along the interior of the cylindrical separation chamber 70, the pressure being such that the softer meat is squeezed through the filter 76 to the outside rear separator surface, constituting in this embodiment the meat fraction outlet, from which it will fall into a suitable collector receptacle not shown , while the bone and unseparated meat eventually exit from an annular bone fraction outlet 88 to another respective collector receptacle also not shown . For more details of the construction and operation of this type of separator unit reference may be made to prior U.S.Patent SpecificationsSerial Nos. 4,025,001 4,069,980 and 4,340,184, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by this reference. In the above described prior apparatus the hopper and separator feed screws, corresponding to the two screws 14 and 84 herein, cooperate to pressurise the mixture of meat and bone to the pressure values mentioned above, which currently are necessary to obtain satisfactory separation without more than the permitted amount of bone being discharged in the meat fraction. In the apparatus of the invention this necessary pressurisation is performed predominantly, and in some embodiments solely, by the positive displacement pump 28. The conveyor screws inherently will add a small amount to the pressurisation, but this will not be significant compared to that provided by the pump. Since the hopper and separator feed screws 14 and 84 are now relieved of the task of pressurising the mixture their design becomes much less onerous and critical. The use of the positive displacement pump, which also acts to break the bones cleanly to suitable size, permits close control of the pressure produced with greatly reduced dependence upon the nature of the mixture and the relative proportions of bone and meat that are present. In the prior art apparatus as represented by those described in the above mentioned U.S.Patent Specifications, the screw conveyors had the dual function of pressurising the mixture and also conveying it through the apparatus, and the pressures which the two screws, particularly the separator screw, were able to apply to the mixture depended in a complicated manner on the relative friction between the meat bone mixture, the screw body and the front face of the separator, and the maximum shear to which the meat or bone could be subjected. The friction also of course differed for different types of meat, and also differed among meats of the same type, depending for example on the proportion of fat present. An optimum condition for good separation is a relatively steady high pressure, but high pressures are difficult to achieve with single screw conveyors.Higher pressures can be obtained with twin screw conveyors, but these are difficult and expensive to design, manufacture and maintain. Attempts to increase the pressure simply by increasing the speed of rotation can easily lead to a situation in which the screw conveyor is shearing the meat without increasing the pressure, resulting in excessive temperature rise and degradation of the quality and texture of the meat fraction. In the apparatus of the invention the positive displacement pump pressurises the mixture without any substantial shearing, except minor amounts at the entry and exit openings, and the conveyors need only convey the material without pressurisation. The screw conveyor 84 must be of smaller volume between successive lands along its length toward the bone fraction exit 88 to take account of the decrease of product volume radially through the filter. Some adjustment of rotational speed may be desirable to take account of different proportions of meat and bone. Thus, if the proportion of bone is high it would be desirable, though not essential, to employ a higher rotational speed of the conveyor 84 in order to expel the larger quantity of bone and maintain the output of the apparatus as high as possible. Figures 4 and 5 illustrate a second embodiment in which the positive displacement pump 28 has an axial inlet as with the pump of the apparatus ofFigures 1 to 3, but has two radial outlets from the pump chamber in the circumferential wall thereof, one of which is constituted by circumferential filter element segments 76 through which the separated meat fraction is expressed to a corresponding outlet 90 from the casing 30, and the other of which is the outlet 88 for the bone fraction. This embodiment therefore provides an exceptionally compact form of the apparatus. The apparatus is also suited to any other application in which at least some separation is requred into two components of different consistencies, for example some dewatering of a sludgy material. In this embodiment the hollow cam plate 38 having an arc of its wall constituted by the separator elements 76 is mounted in a hollow annular support member 92, which is in turn rotatably mounted in the housing 30 for rotation about the axis of rotation of the rotor. The cam can therefore be rotated relative to the rotor to adjust the timing of the cam and the location of the outlet 88 relative to the point of minimum volume of the chamber ,70 defined by the cam, so as to take account of differences in the relative volumes of the two fractions to be produced by the apparatus. In this embodiment the rotation of the cam is effected by a shaft 94 mounted in a bore 96 of the housing for longitudinal movement under the control of a linear operating rotor device not shown such as a hydraulic piston and cylinder motor.The shaft 94 is provided at 98 with rack teeth which mesh with cooperating rack teeth that extend over a sector 100 of the outer periphery of the support member 92. The outlets 88 and 90 in the casing 30 for the two separated fractions are of greater circumferential extent than the corresponding outlets 52 and separator 76 to be able to accommodate this rotation of the cam. Since the apparatus is not required to drive any other piece of apparatus the end plate 34 provides an annular bearing for the adjacent rotor end and is secured to the casing 30 by quick release bolts 104. At the other side the apparatus is provided with an end closure plate 106 bolted to the casing 30 and supporting a thrust bearing 108. The support member 92 completely encloses the cam plate 38 and in so doing also serves to retain in position the separator elements 76 against the relatively high radially outwardly acting pressure of the material passing through it. The embodiment of Figures 6 and 7 is functionally similar to that of Figures 4 and 5, the essential difference being that the inlet 50 to the pump chamber and the associated inlet 110 to the casing 30 are both radial. The hollow ground portions and associated shearing knife edges must therefore be provided at the tips of the vane blades. Figure 8 shows in greater detail a structure for the arcuate separator element 76 as employed in the embodiments of Figures 4 through 7, as seen in side elevation, while Figures 9 and 10 show different forms of element in end elevation. With the form of element illustrated by Figures 8 and 9, each element comprises a central web 112 that remains from the removal of material from a thick plate to leave a narrow arcuate radially inner portion 114. This portion 114 is provided with radial slots 116 through which the separated softer component flows, while the harder component is moved by the vane blades over the separator inner surface 81, which in this embodiment, at this part of the chamber, also constitutes part of the cam surface 62. A plurality of such elements are assembled together and tightly packed with plain flat spacing elements 118 between each two adjacent elements. In the embodiment illustrated by Figures 8 and 10 together the portion 114 is left at one side only of the element and the slots 116 are formed in this one side, so that the elements can be packed tightly together without the need for intermediate plain flat elements. Figures 11 and 12 show unitary filter structures 120 that can be used in place of the stack of elements consisting of a suitably fashioned sheet provided with a large plurality of round holes 122 Figure 11 or slots 124 Figure 2 elongated in the direction of movement of the rotor blades. Figure 13 shows diagrammatically the side elevation of the cam face 62 and a single vane 54a stopped in one position. The diagram shows the centre line 1 of the rotor having its centre of rotation at 126, and the centre line 2 of the cam having its centre of rotation at 128. The distance between the two centres is the eccentricity E which is known. The blade length L and thickness W are also known. The centre line of the blades must always pass through the centre 126 while the eccentricity E is directly proportional to the volume output of the pump and locates the imaginary centre 128 of the cam. The rotor blades must seal the spaces between the rotor blades at all times, and therefore must at all times and in all positions of the rotor be in touch with the cam at both ends. It is arbitrarily chosen that the maximum arc shall be of constant radius R, and this is the arcACB centered at 128 with chord equal to the blade length L. Some correction must be made to L to account for the width of the blade and for the rounded tips of radius W 2. The variable cam radius r measured from centre 128 will vary with the angle 0 and can be calculated geometrically, but an exact equation solution is not easily attainable. The problem is particularly suited to an iterative approach, especially with the use of a computer to effect the relatively large number of calculations required to obtain the values of the cam radius necessary for the required accuracy of manufacture. A value known to be a practical value is assumed for the angle con between the blade centre line and a radius through the centre 128. Angle B can then be determined for any subsequent value of 4 knowing that the sum of angles ss 0 must be 90 degrees. The values of variable cam radius r can then be calculated from the relationshipsEMI13.1 both of which must be satisfied. If the agreement is not within the required tolerance K must be adjusted and the procedure repeated until it is. All of the points on the non constant radius arc ADB can be calculated using the different values of e involved. Other forms of rotary vaned pumps may also be employed in which the vanes are of fixed length, for example a pump of the type in which the vanes are mounted in radial slots in the rotor with their parallel largest faces parallel to the axis of rotation the two radially extending edges of each vane engage complementary face cams on the two facing end walls and, as the rotor rotates, cause the vanes to slide axially of the rotor in their radial slots to vary cyclically the volumes of the chambers formed between the rotor and the end wall face cams. The shearing knife edge will, as with the previouslydescribed embodiments, be provided at the edges which traverse the inlet aperture.However, such a structure requires the accurate production of two complementary face cams and their subsequent assembly facing one another and spacded accurately apart, so that the resulting construction is substantially more expensive than those described above. Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated by Figure 14, which is similar to the embodiment of Figures 1 3. Since, as explained above, the screw 84 is no longer required to pressurise the mixture in the chamber 70, it can be made somewhat shorter in length and substantial clearances can be provided between its exterior surface and the interior surface of the separator elements 76. In this embodiment the screw is designed and arranged to apply a pulsating radially outwardly acting force to the mixture which will facilitate the passsge of the meat component through the separator screen, and hence the separation. To this end the screw profile is formed to be radially eccentric about the longitudinal axis of rotation.The screw tapers outwardly from the pump outlet 52 to the separator outlet 88 in order to take account of the progressive reduction in the volume of the mixture, but the screw lands are much reduced in radial extent as compared with the embodiment illustrated by Figure 1, where the screw lands just clear the interior walls of the se ator elements 76. This large spacing between the land tips and the separator screen reduces the possibility of pieces of the harder component being forced through the slots or jammed in the slots. In a specific example of an apparatus in which the diameter of the chamber 70 is 15cm 6 in. the clearance between the tips of the vestigial lands and the cylindrical interior wall can be as much as 9.5 19mm 0.375 0.75 in. , the spacing of course varying as the screw rotates because of the eccentricity. In this embodiment the outlet 88 for the harder fraction is radial from the chamber 70. The separator means described in relation toFigures 1 10, 12 and 14 provide circumferentially extending elongated slots through which the softer fraction the meat fraction is expressed. The mixture is moved within the chamber 70 both longitudinally and circumferentially thereof, so that the mixture is moved across the slots with a certain degree of shearing action. Round apertures 122 as employed in the embodiment of Figure 11 are multi directional, but the size of hole that can be used is severely limited by the requirement as to the size of solid particles that can be present in the softer fraction. It is therefore preferred to use elongated slots which are both easier to form by cutting or milling and also provide for greater through put of the apparatus.With some embodiments therefore it may be preferred to use a separator element 76 as illustrated by Figure 15, which is cylindrical and is provided with longitudinally extending slots 124 a number of such elements will be assembled end to end and held in place via bars 82. Such a cylindrical separator element 76 may also take the form illustrated by Figure 16, in which elongated slots 124 are disposed at a transverse angle such that they extend both longitudinally and transversely, the angle being determined to match as closely as possible the actual direction of movement of the material in the chamber 70 and minimize shearing between the mixture and the long slot edges.Minimum shearing is desired, especially in apparatus for the separation of meat and bone, since excessive shear can have a deleterious effect upon the quality of the separated softer material. It will be understood that different transverse angles will be optimum for different mixtures to be separated.
