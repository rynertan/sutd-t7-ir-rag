# PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDING MATERIAL

## Abstract
Image transfer photographic recording material is de scribed which employs carbon black in an opaque layer or in an alkaline processing composition. The carbon black has a deactivating compound adsorbed thereto so that dye image providing material can diffuse through the opaque layer, or processing composition, without any substantial adsorption thereof to the carbon black. The deactivating compound is incapable of releasing any dye moiety therefrom. Post processing image dye diffusion is thereby lessened.
