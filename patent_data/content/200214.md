## Description
This invention relates to the use of a calf thymus extract for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a parasitic infection in a mammal. Parasitic infections, chiefly malaria but also leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis and amoebiasis, constitute the most important causes of disease and mortality in the world. Research in this field is of primary interest not only for endemic, mostly tropical Countries but also for other areas in which some formerly indigeneous infections are presently extinct or greatly reduced in incidence, but are steadily imported by travellers from other lands. The attempt for the control of parasitic diseases can be divided into four main groups. These are a the attempt to completely eradicate the infection b the containment of the drug resistance phenomenon which is so easily displayed by parasites c the discovery and introduction into the therapeutic armamentarium of new, more active drugs and d the activation of the resources of the main antagonist of any agent, that is, the reaction of the host. The optimal solution of the problem is, of course, represented by the eradication of the parasite but the achievement of this goal takes time, measurable in terms of centuries, and would appear also to require revolutionary changes in environmental and socio economic conditions of populations dwelling in very large areas. The possibility of establishing a policy of chemotherapeutic prevention and treatment capable of not creating treatment resistant mutants appears equally remote. The intrinsic variability of the parasitic species and the impossibility of controlling the incongruous application of chemotherapeutic drugs precludes the way to any fruitful attempt to avoid the problems of drug resistance. One of the most impressive examples of the difficulties of this approach is the unremitting broadening of areas occupied by multiple drug resistant strains of The prospects of obtaining new drugs for the treatment of parasitic infection is not very hopeful. The search for new anti parasitic compounds appears to be at a fairly low level, especially when compared with other fields of chemotherapy, in spite of the efforts of the World Health Organization s special programmes and the recommendations of a few commentators. Against this background, the perspective of an immunotherapeutic or prophylactic approach takes on special relevance. While immunology is a well established branch of the biomedical sciences, immunoparasitology is a very new field which has only begun to produce experimental and clinical data over the last few years. When challenged by the penetration of a parasite, the host can either unconditionally surrender or engage itself in the struggle by mounting a complex immune reaction that eventually results in either sterile or modulating or concomitant immunity. Sterile immunity is evidenced by the elimination of the parasite with a residual sometimes long lasting resistance toward subsequent infections. A modulating immunity occurs when a complete and efficient immune reaction is raised by the host against the antigenic structure s of the parasite and succeeds in destroying the majority of the infecting population. A number of parasites, however, are capable of evading host reactions through various mechanisms, for instance, the capacity to express different antigenic determinants. The multiplication of such a resistant population brings about a new parasitic wave and the mounting of a new host reaction which follows the steps of the previous reaction in a continuing cycle. It follows that the characteristics of the parasitic population are continuously modulated by the host reaction. The natural history of disease is deeply influenced by these phenomena. A prime example is given by the recurrent course of the parasitemia in the African trypanosomiasis. In this case, the parasites eventually invade the central nervous system and multiply, finding the central nervous system a sanctuary which provides suitable protection against the attack of the iterative immune reaction. The case of the concomitant immunity is quite different. Here, the immune reaction elicited by the parasite is unable to eradicate the infection and persists as long as the parasite itself remains within the host. From a teleological point of view, this condition appears to be the most advantageous one for both partners. An efficient concomitant immunity reaction on one side decreases the host permissivity toward the otherwise hardly tolerable superinfections and on the other side slows down parasitic growth, but ensures the first arrived parasitic population a fair probability of being the last one to be expelled, providing expulsion ever occurs. From an operational point of view, three main groups of immune reactions can be identified. These are pro host reactions which are aimed at either the restriction of parasite proliferation or the prevention of parasite associated reactions that jeopardize the host s biologic equilibrium, pro parasite reactions which act in favor of the parasite infection, and the so called inconsequential reactions which are presumed to be the void of a direct and immediate effect on the host parasite relationship. From a mechanical point of view, the above mentioned phenomenon can be interpreted as the effect of a disarray of immunocytic population functions selectively induced by direct or indirect parasitic actions. Many different mechanisms can be operating. Some parasites are capable of evading the reaction of the immunocytes by invading them, exemplified by the ability of Various information points toward the role played by the suppression phenomena in the pathogenesis of parasitic diseases. Thus, spleen macrophages of malaria infected mice are capable of inhibiting the normal spleen cell response to PHA and LPS. Activated macrophages are presented not only in the spleen, but also in the liver of these animals and their function is altered, but their antigen presenting capacity does not seem to be impaired. Several other facts concur in sustaining the severe derangement of cellular and humoral immune response occurring in these infections, such as the parasite induced synthesis of anti N and anti T autoantibodies and the production by the parasite of suppressor substances, not only in culture, but also in the host s blood. The pivotal part played by T lymphocyte and cell mediated immunity in experimental or human malaria has been emphasized but some problems, e.g. the role of Nk cell and their mediators, are still controversial. There have been previously reported observations on the thymus dependancy of a number of symptoms occurring in plasmodial infections such as splenomegaly, anemia, and enhanced phagocytosis, and the altered course of the disease in athymic or thymectomized animals. Also in animal models of leishmaniasis, the importance of the role of cellular immunity is supported by experimental findings. Coutinho et al,. Induction by Specific T Lymphocytes of Intracellular Destruction of While the foregoing considerations would seem to indicate the use of immunomodulators in treating parasitic diseases, as will be shown below, it has been found that immunomodulators cannot be considered as a group of interchangeable and constantly salutary substances. Congruous evidence is also provided by clinical trials with dexamethasone, a substance endowed with strong lymphocytolitic and immuno modulating properties. The use of the steroid in the treatment of human cerebral malaria is, however, deleterious. Warrell et al, Dexamethasone Proves Deleterious in Cerebral Malaria A Double Blind Trial in 100 Comatose Patients, New Eng. J. Ned., A study of the activity of cyclophosphamide hereinafter termed CPA and TP l described further below on murine plasmodial infections was carried out. Both CPA and TP l are immunomodulating substances endowed with a direct activity on T cell and thymus function and devoid of direct antiparasitic activity. Anatomohystological examination confirmed the predominance of the lymphocytic component in the inflammatory response. In infected animals, the overwhelming majority of cells infiltrating the various organs, chiefly the liver, present the morphologic characteristics of activated lymphocytes, predominantly endowed with markers of T lineage, but also including a number of plasma cells. In the spleen, besides the typical structural derangements and, particularly in the case of the more slowly evolving disease, a dramatic increase in the number of megakaryocytes can also be easily detected. The survival results demonstrate that the course of the infection takes a significantly different shape in the treated animals as compared with the control animals. When the infection takes a slow, sub acute course, the administration of CPA one day before or one day after the inoculation of plasmodia exerts a pro infectious activity. Contrarily, a pro host effect is observed when the same treatment is carried out in animals infected with a greater number of merogenic units and the disease takes a rapidly lethal course. The behaviour of TP l is quite different. Its administration consistently displays a pro host effect that can be synergistic with the pro host effect of CPA or antagonistic to the pro parasitic action of CPA. The anti infectious effect of TP l is present when the preparation is administered either before or after the injection of parasite. The activity of TP l, contrary to the activity of CPA, does not depend on the characteristics of the course of the disease. Of course, any treatment based on the synergistic action of CPA and TP l must be carefully designed to take into account the known toxicity of CPA. TP l is a known calf thymus extract which has been described, inter alia, in Falchetti, et al., Isolation, Partial Characterization and Biological Effects of a Calf Thymus Factor .

The extraction and purification of TP l is described in the Bergesi, et al. article as follows homogenized calf thymuses were extracted with ammonium acetate 0.15 M. and centrifuged in the presence of decalcite. The liquid thus obtained was collected and heated at 70 C for 30 minutes. The proteins coagulated using this procedure were separated by filtration and the clear liquid was precipitated by addition of ammonium sulphate until a 45 saturation had been achieved. The clear liquid obtained after separation of the precipitate via centrifugation, was brought to 90 saturation with ammonium sulphate. The precipitate from this last pass was collected by filtration, dissolved in water and ultrafiltered across a PM 10 membrane. The ultrafiltrate containing salts and protein matter with a molecular weight lower than approximately 10,000 was then lyophilized, desalted on Sephadex G 25 and subsequently gel filtered on Sephadex G 50. Collected were the fractions which, on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.6, showed two characteristic bands with an Rf of about 0.25 and 0.44 compared with bromophenol blue used as a tracer. TP l has been found to have the capacity to increase the responsiveness of mouse spleen lymphoid cells to phytohaemoagglutinin PHA and to concanavalin A stimulation, while it did not increase the response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation to stimulate an increase in E rosette forming lymphocytes from human cord blood, to increase the percentage of Theta positive cells of the mouse spleen population and to stimulate the capacity of allogeneic mouse marrow cells to induce a graft v. host response in X ray irradiated mice. TP l did not cause any acute toxic effect or noticeable side effects in doses of up to 100 mg Kg when administered intraperitoneally to mice for 21 days or to rats for 31 days, nor when administered subcutaneously to rats for 180 days in doses up to 50 mg Kg, nor in dogs receiving intramuscular doses up to 10 mg Kg for 180 days. It did not alter the neuromuscular transmission as evaluated in vitro on the rat phrenic diaphragm nerve and in vivo on the mouse tibial muscle, nor the blood pressure or the electrocardiographic and pneumographic pattern. TP l can easily be differentiated from other thymic extracts because it has two main characteristic bands upon electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.6 while other thymic extracts presently known show only a single characteristic band. At pH 8.6, TP l s two bands are at Rf 0.25 0.05 and Rf 0.45 0.05. To date, TP l has been administered principally by intramuscular injection although other modes of administration can also be employed. The pharmaceutical preparations contain an anti parasitic infection effective amount of TP l together with a compatible, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent which, in case of the intramuscular formulation, may be sterile water. Other conventionally employed excipients such as mannitol can also be included, and the usual array of excipients can be employed in other administration forms. The anti parasitic e.g. antiplasmodial effective amount of TP l is dependent on the age and weight of the individual being treated, the mode of administration and the presence or absence of other infections or diseases. While the dosage administered per day can typically be in the range of about 0.5 to about 1.0 mg. Kg., the response varies considerably from individual to individual and is therefore best determined by the attending clinician. The various embodiments which are set forth herein are for the purpose of further illustrating the invention and are not intended to limit it. This invention relates to the use of a calf thymus extract, which extract shows, upon electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.6, two main characteristic bands with an Rf of about 0.25 and about 0.44 compared with bromophenol blue used as a tracer for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of a parasitic infection in a mammal. Preferably, the calf thymus extract is used parenterally or intramuscularly. According to a preferred use the amount of the calf thymus extract used per day is in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 mg kg. Another preferred use is characterized in that the infection is plasmodial and an antiplasmodial effective amount is used.
