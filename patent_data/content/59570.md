# Control of glassware forming machine.

## Abstract
An individual section glassware forming machine com prises generating means 29 for generating an electrical command signal which is used to control transfer means 2 of the machine. The transfer means 2 is used for transfer ring a parison P from a blank station A at which the parison is formed in an inverted position and presenting the parison P in an upright position at another station B . The magnitude of the electrical command signal varies in accordance with the desired position against time curve for the movement of the parison P and is used to operate an electrical or hydraulic servo mechanism 32 42 for controll ing the movement of the transfer means 2 .
