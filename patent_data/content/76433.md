# FUEL CUT OFF CONTROL SYSTEM IN FUEL INJECTION INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE WITH AUTOMATIC POWER TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
A fuel cut off control can prolong a period of time in which the engine speed is maintained at a range suitable for performing fuel cut off and shorten a period of time in which the engine speed is in a fuel recovery range to minimize fuel consumption during engine deceleration. In a fuel cut off control system in a fuel injection internal combustion engine with an automatic transmission, the fuel cut off control system is responsive to a brake switch signal and an engine speed signal having a value above a fuel recovery threshold to decrease the value of a fuel cut off threshold to again perform the fuel cut off even in the normal fuel recovery range. Down shifting of a transmission gear is performed to increase engine speed to a level beyond the fuel cut off threshold to prolong the fuel cut off period.
