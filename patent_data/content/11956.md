# Flow responsive device and utilisation thereof.

## Abstract
A flow responsive device 10 for use in a fluid flow system to establish a signal when a predetermined flow rate is attained within a flow conduit. The device 10 is adapted for connection to a flow conduit 12 and has a target vane 26 adapted for insertion within the flow conduit for movement in response to predetermined flow to open internal valve means 24 against the bias force of a compression spring 34 and control pressure within a pressure chamber 16 . In operation, the control pressure is maintained at a higher pressure than the fluid pressure within the flow conduit 12 so that after initial opening of the valve means 24 , the control pressure drops and the valve means undergoes fast action movement to its fully open condition. The flow rate at which the valve means 24 closes is less than the flow rate at which the valve means 24 opens so that hunting of the valve means during operation is prevented. The pressure chamber 16 may be connected to a control line 18 having a flow restrictor therein so that when the valve means is opened, a pressure drop across the flow restrictor establishes a signal which may be employed to control external equipment.
