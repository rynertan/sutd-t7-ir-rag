# SUCTION TUBE HEAT EXCHANGER AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
The invention concerns a suction type heat exchanger for locating in cooling circuits, comprising a suction tube 1 and a capillary tube 2 . The suction tube is provided with one or more integrated grooves 3 shaped complementary to and dimensioned for insertion of the capillary tube. The method for manufacturing the suction heat exchangers is based on exposure to the plastic deformation of both tubes after insertion of the capillary tube 2 into the groove 3 in the suction tube.
