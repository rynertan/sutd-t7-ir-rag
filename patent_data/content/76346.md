# Article carrier having improved locking means.

## Abstract
The basket type carrier has locking tabs in the lower portions of riser panels at both ends of the carrier which are engaged by the carrier bottom panel to maintain the carrier in squared set up condition. The locking tabs and the pair of V shaped notches of the bottom panel are sized and positioned such that displacement of a carrier end wall to engage one tab causes simultaneous displacement of the opposite end wall by an amount sufficient just to clear the opposite locking tab from the bottom panel. Complete locking occurs when the displacement force is relieved. The depth of the two notches is different but, in each case, the depth is equal to the distance along the riser panel between the outermost portion of the throat and the adjacent carrier end wall of the respective locking tabs.

## Description
ARTICLE CARRIER HAVING IMPROVED LOCKING MEANS This invention relates to a cellular article carrier of the basket style which is fabricated from a single blank of flexible sheet material, the blank being cut and creased so that it is divided into a number of panels which thereafter are folded and secured in a predetermined relationship with respect to one another so as to provide an article carrier having a plurality of article accommodating cells. In order to facilitate loading of articles into the cells of such a carrier and to provide for stability when the empty carrier is free standing, it is important to ensure that the carrier is set up in a squared and secure condition. To this end, it is known to form locking tabs in the lower portions of riser panels at both ends of the carrier to be engaged in notches provided in the bottom panel of the carrier.Typical examples of the prior art are shown in U.S. patents toAnness et al No. 3,027,815 Figures 22 and 23 and Wood et alNo. 3,572,542. However, such known double lock arrangements are either difficult to engage or, if arranged so as to facilitate the locking engagement of the bottom panel, do not always hold the carrier in a secure and fully locked condition. According to one aspect of this invention, there is provided a cellular article carrier of the basket style comprising a bottom panel 1 , opposed sidewalls 2, 2a foldably joined to opposite side edges of said bottom panel, end panels 7, 8 foldably joined to the ends of said sidewalls and extending transversely inward therefrom, medial riser panels 5, 6 foldably joined to said end panels respectively, locking means A, B formed in said riser panels adjacent the lower ends thereof at each end of the carrier for respectively receiving cooperating locking means 15, 16 provided in the bottom panel so as to hold the carrier in squared, set up condition, characterized in that the relative dimensions of the locking means are such that when one riser panel locking means A is caused fully to engage its cooperating bottom panel locking means 16 during inward displacement of said one riser panel 6 , the other riser panel locking means B simultaneously is caused to clear its cooperating other bottom panel locking means 15 by an amount necessary to achieve locking cooperation between said other locking means B, 15 when said inward displacement is ceased. According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a cellular article carrier of the basket style comprising a bottom panel 1 , opposed sidewalls 2, 2a foldably joined to opposite side edges of said bottom panel, end panels 7, 8 foldably joined to the ends of said sidewalls and extending transversely inward therefrom, medial riser panels 5, 6 foldably joined to said end panels respectively, a locking tab A, B formed in said riser panels adjacent the lower ends thereof at each end of the carrier, each tab having a recessed throat portion 9, 11 and a projecting toe portion 10, 12 for respectively engaging in a cooperating notch 15, 16 adjacent an end edge of said bottom panel so as to hold the carrier in squared set up conditionj characterized in that the direct distance X between the innermost part of the toe portion of one locking tab B and the outermost part of the throat of the opposite locking tab A is no smaller than the direct distance between said cooperating interior edges of notches 15, 16 of the bottom panel. For a better understanding of the invention, reference is now made to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view, in part section, of a basket style carrier shown in its collapsed condition Figure 2 is a view of the underside of the same carrier showing the bottom panel engaged with one of the locking tabs andFigure 3 is a view of the underside of the same carrier after the locking operation has been completed. In the drawings, the numeral 1 designates the bottom panel of a basket style carrier, the bottom panel being hinged to one of the carrier sidewalls 2 and joined to the opposite carrier sidewall 2a by means of a glue flap 3 hinged thereto. The bottom panel 1 has a central fol8 line 4 along which the bottom panel is folded into two overlapping sections when the carrier is in its collapsed condition as shown in Figure 1. As is well known in the art, the carrier comprises a pair of internal riser panels 5 and 6 Figure 1 extending medially inwardly from opposite ends of the carrier and being hinged to foldable end walls 7 and 8 respectively. The riser panel 5 is formed at its lower end with a locking tab B which comprises a throat 9 formed by a recessed portion of the innermost edge of the riser panel 5 and an inwardly extending toe 10 at the base of the riser panel. The lowermost portion of the riser panel 5 provides a foot lOa of the locking tab B . The length of the foot lOa between the throat 9 and the toe 10 is designated dimension D . Similarly, the riser panel 6 is formed at its lower end with a locking tab A provided with a throat 11, a toe 12 and a foot 12a.However, in this case the recess providing throat 11 of the locking tab A is deeper than the recess providing the throat 9 of locking tab B . In other words, the throat 11 is located further towards the adjacent end wall 8 of the carrier. The length of the foot 12a between the throat 11 and the toe 12 is designated dimension C . In order to cooperate with the locking tabs A and B so as to maintain the carrier in a squared set up condition, the bottom panel 1 of the carrier has end edges 13, 14 which are each formed with a central V shaped notch 15, 16, respectively. In both instances, the apices of the notches 15, 16 are interconnected by the central fold line 4. The notch 15 is struck from the end edge 13 of the bottom panel and the depth of the notch, i.e. the distance between its mouth at end edge 13 and its apex 15a, is substantially equal to the distance along riser panel 5 between the throat 9 of the locking tab B and the adjacent end wall 7 of the carrier. In the case of V shaped notch 16 it will be seen that the notch depth, i.e. the distance between its mouth and its apex, is smaller than that of notch 15.This is because the notch 16 is struck from a recessed zone 17 formed centrally along end edge 14 by a pair of shallow, inwardly divergent edges 18, 19, respectively. Thus, the mouth of notch 16 is set back from the end edge 14 so as to facilitate the locking procedure as described shortly. The cooperating part of the riser panel is correspondingly smaller in that the throat 11 of locking tab A is positioned closer to the adjacent end wall 8 of the carrier than is the case with throat 9 of tab B . This is achieved by recessing into the riser panel 6 further so as to produce a larger toe to throat dimension C . The resulting arrangement of these dimensions is such that the total length of the central fold line 4, i.e.the distance between the apices 15a, 16a of the notches 15, 16, is equal to or slightly less than the distance between the innermost point of the toe 10 of locking tab B and the outermost point of the throat 11 of locking tab A . This dimension is designated X in Figure 1 of the drawings. The locking of the bottom panel 1 to the locking hooks is effected during the setting up operation of the carrier as follows During the opening sequence of the carrier from its collapsed condition when the carrier sidewalls 2, 2a are being moved apart from one another, an inward pressure is applied to the bottom panel 1 immediately before the carrier has fully opened so as to cause the notch 16 to be engaged within the throat 11 of locking tab A . In order to fully locate the notch 16 and locking tab A , force is applied to the adjacent end wall 8 of the carrier so that it is moved inwardly until portions of the inside face of wall 8 abut the converging edges 18 and 19 of the central recessed zone 17. Thus, the apex 16a of notch 16 will be fully engaged within the throat 11 of the tab A .As described above, the dimensions of the throat 11 and of the notch depth of notch 16 are specifically sized such that upon maximum entry of the notch 16 into the throat locking tab A , the end wall 7 simultaneously is displaced outwardly relative to end edge 13 an amount sufficient to allow the toe 10 of locking tab B just to clear the apex 15a of the cooperating notch 15.This condition is illustrated in Figure 2. The bottom panel is then caused to be moved inwardly and sideways force relieved so that the carrier is relaxed, whereby notch 15 is brought into engagement with the locking tab B . In so doing the apex 16a of notch 16 will move relative to the toe 12 of locking tab A so that the bottom panel 1 is centralized and retained by the locking tabs A and B . This final locking condition of the carrier is illustrated inFigure 3. It is not essential that the distances C and D of the locking tabs A and B are of different dimensions since it is quite conceivable, although unnecessary, that the throat of the lock B may be extended so that the dimension D equals dimension C . Naturally, in order for correct locking to be effected it is essential that the dimensional relationships are chosen such that the end wall of the carrier having the locking tab first to be engaged can be displaced inwardly by an amount which is sufficient to cause enough outward displacement of the opposite carrier end wall so that the locking tab carried thereby can just clear its associated notch. Thus, when the displacement pressure is relieved so that the carton can relax, the second locking tab will engage the bottom panel 1. By this invention easy setting up operations are afforded and at the same time the locking tabs are arranged so as to hold the carrier in a secure locked condition against inadvertent unlocking particularly during intial loading of the carrier. Thus, a carrier is provided which is securely locked at both ends and which therefore is necessarily set up in a squared and secured condition so that it is not subject to being easily toppled inadvertently.
