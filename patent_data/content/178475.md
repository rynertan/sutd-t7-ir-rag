# JAMB LINER SASH STOP

## Abstract
A nail bearing sash stop 20 mounts on a jamb liner 10 having a parting bead 11 between a pair of sash runs 12 and 13. Retainer slots 15 in opposite sides of parting bead 11 adjacent sash runs 12 and 13 engage and hold a longitudinal side edge of stop 20 for retaining stop 20 on jamb liner 10 before assembly and for allowing sash stop 20 to move longitudinally of jamb liner 10 during assembly. A preferred embodiment of stop 20 has opposite side edges 41 that can be sprung together for a resilient fit between parting bead 11 and guide wall 14 in a sash run spaced from parting bead 11.
