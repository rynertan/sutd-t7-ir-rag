## Description
AN INC ERASER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel and useful ink eraser. ore particularly, it relates to an ink eraser comprising a first agent in a non liquid form and a second agent composed of a quick drying solution, which not only enables rewriting immediately after erasion, but is free of discoloration of a paper erased.2. Description of Prior Art A variety of ink erasers for writing ink, printing ink, copying ink, stamp ink and the like have been proposed.Generally, ink erasers utilizing oxydation reduction reaction, for example, those for blue black ink are a double fruid type composed of a bleaching powder aqueous solution and oxalic acid, Moreover, ink erasers for ball point pens are also a double fluid type composed of a bleaching powder aqueous solution and an ink solvent ofball point pens. These ink erasers are all double fluid types and therefore involve the following problems a the portion erased has to be left to stand for 10 minutes or more after erasion to be dried before rewriting, b letters rewritten are liable to discolor or disappear with the lapse of time, and c the portion erased is liable to discolor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an ink eraser which enables rewriting immediately after erasion. It is another object of the present invention to provide an ink eraser which is free of discoloration of a paper after erasion, or discoloration or emaciation of written letters, These and other objects of the present invention together with the advantages thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed disclosure of the present invention as set forth hereinbelow. The present invention has been completed through a series of study nade by the present inventor on the discovery that the foregoing objects can be acheved by the combinati on cf a first agent in a non liquid form and a second agent composed of a quick drying solution, furthermore, the combination of those firs and second agents and a third agent composed of a residual chlorine disposing agent. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention encompasses an ink erase comprising a first agent composed of a powdery, paste or solid chlorine bleaching agent and a second agent composed of a quick drying solution, and moreover, an ink eraser further containing a third agent composed of a residual chlorine disposing agent. The chlorine bleaching agent as a first agent suitably used in the present invention may include a powdery one such as bleaching powder, a liquid one such as a sodium hypochlorite aqueous solution, and moreover, highs bleaching powder having high content of active chlorine, the main ingredient of which is hypochlorite, may also be suitably used. The quick drying solution as a second agent suitably used in the present invention includes organic c solvent having lower boiling points,which are exemplified by ethers such as ethyl ether, ketones such as acetone, aldehydes such as furfural, esters such as methyl formate, ethyl forrnate, propyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and propyl acetate, hydrocarbon halides such as methylene chloride and ethylidene dichioride, or the like. The first agent may be in any for of powder, paste and sold, but paste and solid forms are preferred because of easy handling those permit coating on the desired and limited portion. As the first agent In a form of powder, bleaching powder may be used without any processing. It may be also obtained by impregnating silicates such as calcium silicate with a liquid chlorine bleaching agent such as a sodium hypochlorite solution and then drying the same to be i in a form of powder1 As the first agent in a form of paste may be obtained by dissolving a binding agent in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methyl ethyl ketone, toluene and acetone, in which said chlorine bleaching agent in a form of powder is dispersed. Examples of the binding agent may include chlorineresistant rubbers exemplified by ethylene propylene rubbers such as EP 33 Tradename, produced by Japan Synthetie Rubber Co., Ltd. , chlorosulfonated polyethylenes such as HYPALON Registered Trademark, E. I. Du Pont deNemours Co., Ltd. , silicone rubbers such as KE 76 , KE 77 Tradenames, produced by Shin Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. and thermoplastic elastomers exemplified by polyethylene elastomers such as TPE Tradename, produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. , and polyvinyl chloride elastomers such as SMIFLEX Trademark, produced bySumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd. . Even when the binding agent is not used, good results leaving no binding agent on a paper are rather provided.Moreover, gypsum and surface active agents such as EMAL Trademark, produced by Kao Atlas Co., Ltd. and NEW REX , SYNTREX Trademarks, produced by Nippon Oils Fats Co., Ltd. may alac be served as the foregoing binding agent. The first agent in a form of paste may also be prepared by dispersing a powdery chlorine bleaching agent in a liquid chlorine bleaching agent such as a sodium hypochlorite solution and sodium chlorite. Moreover, it may also be provided by impregnating silicates such as calcium silicate with the foregolng liquid chlorine bleaching agents.The mixing ratio is, for example, 100 parts by weight of bleaching powder and 40 to 100 parts by weight of sodium hypochlorite. The first agent in a form of solid may be obtained by pouring into a mold the foregoing paste agent prepared by the employment of binding agents, then drying at a temperature between room temperature and approximately 60 cm . The foregoing powdery agent obtained by impregnating silicates with liquid chlorine bleaching agent and drying may, of course, be employed. The solid agent should preferably be processed into a chalk or lipstick shape so that it may be handled without being in contact with hands.The mixing ratio of binding agents, solvents and chlorine bleaching agent is not specifically limited. That is, when a solvent is used in greater amounts, an amount of the solvent removed in a later drying step increases naturally, while uniform and easy mixing of a binding agent and a bleaching agent is 2ttai ned. With the binding agent used in greater ainounts, an amount of active chlorine contained in the product decreases, in consequence, erasion ability decreases. Accordingly, the mixing ratio should be determined, taking into account the foregoing relationship An example is 100 parts by weight of binding agents, l50 to 300 parts by weight of solvents, and 400 to 600 parts by weight of chlorine bleaching agents in a form of powder.Addition of perfumes to the first agent is a preferred embodiment Furthermore, it is also possible to provide the solid first agent by heating with stirring a vinyl chloride resin, a plasticizer, if necessary, a filler and a stabilizer to obtain a gel, to which a chlorine bleaching agent such as bleaching powder is uniformly dispersed. To the second agent used in the present invention, residual chlorine disposing agents such as ammonia, acid sodium sulfite and the like may be added in a small amount. Penetrants such as surface active agents e. g. anionic surface active agents are preferred , ink solvents such as ethers and alcohols, perfumes and the like may further be added. The second invention is to provide an ink eraser comprising the foregoing first and second agents, and a third agent composed of residual chlorine disposing agents.The residual chlorine disposing agent removes active chlorine from the surface of the paper, whereby discoloration of the paper is not only prevented, but rewriting immediately after erasion is mad possible. Therefore, ar,y substance reactlonalble with the active chlorine may be suitably used, including, for example, solutions obtained by dissolving almonla1 acid sodium sulfite in an organic solvent such as acetone. An example of the mixing ratio is lOO parts by weight of organic solvents and about 0..S to about 5 parts by weight of residual chlorine disposing substances. When the ink eraser of the present invention is utilized, the first agent is at first applied to The spot to be erased by sprinkling or coating, then the second agent is applied by coating. In this case, rubbing out the spot slightly accelerates the reaction and is thus recommendable. Breathing upon the spot after coating of the second agent quickens vaporization to thus shorten te rewriting tine the time required for rewriting after erasion , The rewriting time may be reduced to several seconds or substantially zero second by using the second agent containz ng the residual chlorine disposing agent or the third agent composed of the residual chlorine disposing agent. Above all, when the third agent is used in combination with the first and the second agents, rewriting becomes possible with once or double coating of the third agent. The first and the second agents may also be mixed immediately before use and then applied.Each of the three kinds of agents may be effectively applied to the spot to be erased with cloths, papers, sponges, absorbent cotton, brushes and the like.The first agent in a form of solid may be applied by being rubbed on a paper. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be explained in more detail by way of Examples and Comparative Examples that follow, to which the scope of the invention is in no way limited.Examples 1 6, Compa ative Examples 1 2A Preparation of first, second and third agents Each of the first, second and third agents was prepared as set forth in Table 1.
