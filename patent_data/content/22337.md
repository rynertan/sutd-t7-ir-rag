# Method for making rotary die racks.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for making rotary die racks 12 having an elongated shape including a partially circular forming face 16 of less than 180 and a flat mounting surface 26 that faces in the opposite direction as the forming face 16 . Cast metal blanks of the die racks are secured to a rotatable spindle 10 in a side by side relationship to turn the forming faces 16 . Forming projections, i.e. teeth that extend parallel to the axis of the forming face, are then cut in the turned face 16 . Heat treating of the die racks 12 is then performed before mounting thereof on a fixture to perform a finish grinding of the teeth. The spindle preferably includes a spindle member and a central shaft on which the spindle member is mounted for rotation. The fixture includes a pair of spaced end plates and a bed that extends between the end plates and has a stop and an adjustable positioner for clamping the die racks.
