# Stator for magnet type rotating machines.

## Abstract
A stator for magnet type rotating machines comprises projections 20a formed in the inner circumferential surface of a fixed frame 20 in the circumferential direction at a predetermined distance. Position determining pieces 30 each having elasticity and engaging parts 30b are fitted to the projections 20a . Permanent magnets 1 are secured between the position determining pieces 30 in such a manner that the raised portions 30c of the position determining pieces are in contact with end surfaces extend ing in the radial direction of the permanent magnets 1 and the engaging parts 30b are in contact with end surfaces in the circumferential direction of the permanent magnets to effect determination of position of the same.
