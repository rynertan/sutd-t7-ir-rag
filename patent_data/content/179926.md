# INTERFACE DEVICE BETWEEN NUMERICALLY CONTROLLED APPARATUS AND ELECTRIC POWER CONTROL CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
The invention makes it possible to detect the real speed of a numerically controlled apparatus NC of an electric power control circuit PC , and to control the real speed of the numerically controlled apparatus NC . An interface device between the numerically controlled apparatus NC and the electric power control circuit PC is equipped with a memory 50 for real speed onto which the real speed data will be written from the numerically controlled apparatus NC and which can read the written data from the electric power control circuit PC , and is further equipped with a memory 51 for corrected speed onto which the data of corrected speed will be written from the electric power control circuit PC and which can read the written data from the numerically controlled apparatus NC . On the side of the electric power control circuit CP , therefore, the data is read from the memory 50 for real speed to determine the real speed of the numerically controlled apparatus NC , and is further written onto the memory 51 for corrected speed to control the real speed of the numerically controlled apparatus NC .
