# Semiconductor integrated circuit device constructed by polycell technique.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit device has cell arrays 11 1, 11 2, 11 3 each constituted by unit cells 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D, 11E containing functional circuits 16, 19, 20, 23, 26 . Polysilicon wiring layers 15A, 15B, 15C or diffusion wiring lay ers are formed in the wiring regions 12 1, 12 2 provided among the arrays. A first metal wiring layer 13A, 13B, 13C is formed by computer aided design above each polysilicon wir ing layer 15A, 15B, 15C or each diffusion wiring layer. An insu lating layer is then formed on the first metal wiring layer 13A, 13B, 13C . A second metal wiring layer 14A, 14B is formed by computer aided design above the insulating layer. A via con tact hole 17 is cut in the insulating layer. A portion of the sec ond metal wiring layer 14A, 14B fills up the via contact hole 17 whereby the second metal wiring layer 14A, 14B is con nected to the first metal wiring layer 13A, 13B, 13C . The via contact hole 17 is formed above each polysilicon wiring layer 15A 15B, 15C or each diffusion wiring layer. It may have its axis intersecting with the axis of the polysilicon or diffusion wir ing layer or not intersecting therewith. In the first case, the overlapping portions of the first and second metal wiring layer 13A, 13B, 13C, 14A, 14B are made broader to facilitate the forming of the via contact hole 17 . In the second case, the portion of each polysilicon or diffusion wiring layer which is po sitioned below the via contact hole 17 is made broader than the other portions.
