# INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM COMPRISING A REGISTER RENEWAL WAITING CONTROL CIRCUIT WITH RENEWAL REGISTER NUMBER REGISTERING MEANS

## Abstract
When one of general registers has a register number indicated by a renewal instruction and should be renewed to a result of execution by an arithmetic unit of an execution time measured in terms of machine cycles for the renewal instruc tion, a register 91 holds the register number as a held num ber. From a machine cycle number representative of the ex ecution time, a counter 95 is counted down in each machine cycle to successively provide decreasing numbers. Coinci dence circuits 97, 98 find coincidence between the held num ber and two register numbers indicated by a current instruc tion which is preceded by the renewal instruction and for which two operands should be read from the general registers of the two register numbers. When the coincidence is found, execution of the current instruction is suspended. Otherwise, the operands are read. The suspension is released when the counter is counted down to zero.
