# Single reel tape cartridges.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape cartridge 11 is shown in which a length of magnetic tape 12 is wound on a reel hub 10 with the free end of the tape permanently connected to a gener ally rectangular shaped leader block 13 . The cartridge completely surrounds the reel of magnetic tape except for an opening 16 provided at one corner of the cartridge 11 . This opening 16 permits tape 12 wound on the reel to be unwound as the leader block is moved away from the car tridge, preferably by an automatic threading mechanism. The cartridge comprises a leader block receiving well in which the leader block 13 is a snug fit. The walls 33, 51 of the well have the opening 16 in them through which the tape enters and leaves the cartridge. The walls 53, 33 of the leader block well are arranged to engage the leading and trailling walls of the leader block in a clamping relation ship and help retain the block in the well in a position in which the opening 16 in the cartridge is substantially sealed by the leader block to prevent contamination from entering the cartridge when the cartridge is not in use. To remove the leader block from the well, it must initially be swivelled about boss 60 providing a mechanical advan tage.
