# Radiation image recording and reproducing method.

## Abstract
A radiation image recording and reproducing method comprising steps of causing a stimulable phosphor to absorb a radiation having passed through an object or having radiated from an object, exciting said stimulable phosphor with an electromagne tic wave having a wavelength within the range of 450 900 nm to release the radiation energy stored therein as light emis sion, and detecting the emitted light, in which said stimulable phosphor is a divalent europium activated barium fluorohalide phosphor having the formula I BaF Br‚ÇÅ
