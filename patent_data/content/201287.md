# Logic circuit having a test data loading function.

## Abstract
A logic circuit having a test data loading function, compris ing at least one J K flip flop 1 . Each J K flip flop includes a test data latching logic circuit 2 . In response to an enable sig nal E , test data D is selected in place of the usual J and K in put data to be latched. In a complex logic circuit including such flip flops, a test can be effected in a short time.
