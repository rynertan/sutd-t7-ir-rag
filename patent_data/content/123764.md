# Modular metal barriers to be set up by restraining.

## Abstract
The barrier can be set up by restraining, on the counter posed longitudinal guides of a profile pair in parallel, shaped unions by stabilizing them in a composition suc cession between spacers. The composition can be blocked at the end by means of a blocking plate at the angle posts. The system allows the employ particularly for anodized aluminum profiles which can be connected without using fixing screws. It will then be possible to compose only by means of restraining enclosure barriers, staircase balus trades, terraces, gates and anything else in this connection.

## Description
koduXr al barrie a a be ee ux by restraint The invention refers to a system which permits to carry out metal barriers exclusively by means of restraining composition. The invention, which avoids the necessity of boring the components, can be used in the metal structur in general and particularly for those in anodized aluminium.For composing barriers, at present each component is blocked by means of through screws and nuts boring causes the weaken ing of the aluminium structure, an irksome mounting work, as well as the necessity of employing skilled workers. To which it is to add that the connection of anodized aluminium structu res requires special screws in stainless steel. This mounting procedure turns out to be very limiting for the employ of ano dized aluminium in the building industry on account of the costs and of the required worker skill. The connection of the parts, in fact, if carried out through other fixing means, would cause burr to the aluminium parts.The invented method enables the integral solution of the problem by adopting a modular system to be carried out exclusivi ly by means of restraining the components. The system employs three orders of components a pair of profiled girders A andB, to be employed in parallel, the shaped unions C and D which complete the structure and are stablized between the spacers E.The barrier can be composed by inserting on the longitudinal guides of the sections set up in parallel, the end parts properly prepared in advance of the shaped unions, bringing them into restraining position, and then by fitting the spacers and so on in a modular prosecution. Forms of execution are supplied in a merely indicative way with the drawings. of Tables I and 2, where Fig. 1 is the view of the upper girder, which operates also as handrail, and Fig. 2 is a view of he lower girder0 iron the two figurss, the oentml i des can be noted which are used for setting up the shaped unions.Fig. 3 is the cross section of a spacer, while Fig. 4 is the view of an upper girder with a shaped unio fitted on it which can be observed in its end part. Fig. 5 is the view of a composition part with straight unions employing all system parts. Fig. 6 is a front view of a composition as seen in Fig. 5. Fig. 7 of Table 2 is the cross section of the upper girder, with a union fitted on the stabilization spacer of the projecting type, that can be noted in the terminal0 Fig. 8 is the perspective view of the spa cer to employ for the condition of Fig. 7. Fig. 9 is the composi tion perspective view employing projecting shaped unions. The use of spacers can be noted as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 10 is the front view of the composition as per Fig. 9. Fig. 71 is a view of the particular of a plate fitted in addition for blocking the composi tion at the angle posts.The straight unions show a flat structure 1 c with symmetrical recessings 2c and end parts 3c for allowing the binding condition,The upper girder A shows a convex envelope la acting as handrail with symmetrical recessing 2a and lower flat parts 3a with a central slit 4a determined by the inner lap Sa of the borders. The lower profile B presents shape 1b with a square base and central slit 2b determined by the inside lap of borders 3b. Distance piece E function is to stabilize the shaped unions of type C or D , at the distance fixed in advance, by blocking them in their seats.It is characterized by plate I e with central restraining part 2e which is inserted into the guide in a balanced condition through the pair of lugs 3e and 4eO The spacer shows an inner straight recessing for fitting a screw to fix an end plate for blocking the angle posts when the composition has been completed. For mounting a flat barrier, the pair of horizontal parallel girders A3 and B are at first fitted on the angle post then a pair of spacers is applied, and subsequently a fillet of type C and so on until the structure is eempleted The set of flat fillets will be stabilized in the guides 4a and 2b by means of spacers. The intermediate connection between the unions c in particular can be executed by means clamp connectors 1 to be fitted and blocked in different ways.For mounting projecting barriers, the stabilization of unions D on the terminals has been foreseen by means of binding seats on the spacers to obtain by composing the half recesses Se. The projecting fillet 1d shows shaped end parts with curv ing 2d which act by retaining when unbinding. For the composi tion, the pair of distance pieces E is at first inserted, by fitting end parts 2d afterwards into the pair of slits 5e and by completing the binding condition by inserting the subsequent spacer pair. As the structure is completed, it can be blocked on the head distance piece by means of a screw for fixing a blocking plate to the angle post of the barrier. The shape of all system components may change according to the requirements of the design.The materials, the fixing elements and the completing ones may be foreseen in different ways.
