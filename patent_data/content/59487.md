# Reproduction of character images, particularly for typesetting apparatus.

## Abstract
The solid area of a desired image is created and displayed on an incrementing plotter, such as a cathode ray tube 92 . A master curve, e.g. a spiral, is stored electronically in a memory 16 as a sequence of vector step instructions. A smoothly continuous outline which is representative of the outline of the desired image is achieved by selecting appropriate curve sections from the memory to match the desired outline and re orientating these curve sections so that successive sections join perfectly. The outline is not displayed but the data relating to it is used automatically to create further data which is characteristic of the solid area of the desited image, and this further data is produced on the plotter 92 as a pattern of discontinuous adjacent parallel stripes which matches the solid area.
