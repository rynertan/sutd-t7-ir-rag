## Abstract
Process and plant for manufacturing carbonaceous solids and hydrocarbons from discarded tires pyrolysis reactor for use in such process. Used tires are physically fragmented. The fragments are pyrolized in an oxygen limited, hydrocarbon vapor at subatmospheric pressure in a reactor 32 . Entrained char can be separated from the vapor phase products of the pyrolysis which are then fractionated into oil and fuel gas. Reactor vapors are condensed to produce a heavy fuel oil and a light fuel oil. The fuel gas can be compressed and burnt to provide process heat. The entrained char and some heavy oil can be returned to the reactor 32 . Solid phase pyrolysis products can be stripped of trash and milled to carbon black. The carbon black is formed into pellets with added water and dried in a series multi stage fluid bed dryer 126 .
