# Solid rinse aids and methods of warewashing utilizing solid rinse aids.

## Abstract
Methods of warewashing utilizing a solid rinse aid, and the solid rinse aid which comprises a surfactant and urea, and preferably a dispensing rate adjusting additive, are disclosed. The solid rinse aid reduces spotting of the dishes being washed, and promotes faster drying by allowing the rinse water to rinse from the dishes quickly and evenly.
