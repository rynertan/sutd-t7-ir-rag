# Process for the preparation of optically active 2 phenoxy propionic acids and herbicidal preparations containing such acids.

## Abstract
A process is provided for making D 2 phenoxy pro pionic acid by condensing in water an alkali metal salt of 2 chloropropionic acid which is dextro rotatory in wa ter with an alkali metal phenoxide of a halogen or me thyl substituted phenol. The overall amount of water in the condensation mixture is not more than about 8 moles water per mole of said alkali metal salt of 2 chloropropio nic acid in order to selectively produce the dextro rota tory optical isomer. The so obtained compounds are used in herbicidal preparations.
