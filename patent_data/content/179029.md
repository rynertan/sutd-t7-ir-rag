# A device for measuring the grinding gap between two grinding discs in a disc refiner.

## Abstract
In a refiner with width of the gap 8 is indicated by a transmitter 10 located in one 4 of two counter rotating refiner discs 4, 5 . The indicating device operates according to the reluctance method, and electric effect is transferred contact free to the transmitter 10 via one axle 2 through a transformer coupling 15, 17, 18, 20 . The measurement signal from the transmitter 10 is transferred contact free from a transmitting means 22, 23 on the axle 2 to a stationary receiver means 21, 24 .
