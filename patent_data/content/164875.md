## Abstract
A microscope 60 comprises an objective lens 10 having an optical axis 12 , an eyepiece tube 66 , first auxiliary means 74 and second auxiliary means 32 . The first and second auxiliary means 74, 32 receive an image from the objective 10 along first and second beam paths 68, 70, 72, 36 and 38 respectively. The beam paths are arranged to intersect so that both the first and second auxiliary means 74, 32 can be arranged in an ergonomically favourable manner.
