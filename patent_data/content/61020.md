# Arc restricting device for circuit breaker.

## Abstract
The present invention combines the provision of arc shields 6, 7 surrounding the contacts 202, 302 of a circuit breaker with a magnetic driving means 8 to raise the arc voltage of an arc drawn across the contacts 202, 302 and to effectively drive the arc, whereby the performance of the circuit breaker is improved.
