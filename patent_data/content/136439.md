# ACRYLIC POLYMERS OF INTERMEDIATE MOLECULAR WEIGHT

## Abstract
Thermoplastic polymers of intermediate molecular weight are prepared by polymerizing a hydrophilic monomer such as acrylic acid, a sort monomer such as ethyl acrylate, and a hard monomer such as methyl methacrylate, in the presence of a free radical initiator in a solvent selected from methyl ethyl ketone and ethanol.
