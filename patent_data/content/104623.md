## Description
DUCTILE BRAZING ALLOY CONTAINING REACTIVE METALS AND PRECIOUS METALSFIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to brazing alloys. More particularly it relates to brazing alloys containing a reactive metal having a liquidus temperature above about OC. BACK GROUND Alloys containing titanium are known. These alloys contain relatively high levels of titanium. Generally the titanium content is above about 7 by weight. These alloys are not ductile and can not be rolled to a foil in a satisfactory manner and upon brazing contains a brittle dispersed phase is present.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Reactive metal precious metal alloys containing specified amounts of nickel, copper and mixtures thereof have liquidus temperatures in the range of from about C.to about Dd are ductile and after brazing are relatively free of hard dispersed phases. DETAILS OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, advantages and capabilities thereof, reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims in connection with the above description of some of the aspects of the inven tion. The amount of the reactive metal in the alloys of this invention which also contain a precious metal selected from gold, palladium and mixtures thereof and a third metal selected from Ni, Cu, Cr, Mo and mixtures thereof cannot appreciably exceed about 5 by weight and achieve a ductile material which upon brazing is free of dispersed phases. The amount of reactive metal in the alloys of this invention is from about 0.1 by weight to about 5 by weight, with from about 1 by weight to about 3 by weight being preferred. By reactive metal, within the context of this disclosure, is meant titanium, zirconium, vanadium and mixtures thereof. While titanium generally is the preferred reactive metal, alloy compositions of Ti Zr and Ti V are equally effective. The weight percent of the precious metal, which is selected from gold, palladium and mixtures thereof, can vary from about 25 by weight to about 85 by weight. The preferred level is generally from about 28 by weight to about 81 by weight. The weight percent of the third metal which is selected from copper, nickel and mixtures, thereof can vary from about 15 by weight to about 70 by weight. When nickel is the third metal it is preferably present in amounts of from about 17 by weight to about 40 by weight.when copper is the third metal it is preferably present in amounts of from about 50 by weight to about 65 by weight. Chromium is an optional metal which can be added to the alloys of this invention to improve corrosion resistance. When added it is added in amount of from about 2 by weight to about 15 by weight and preferably from about 5 to about 10 by weight. Various alloys are prepared. by skull melting using a tungsten electrode and an argon atmosphere. The alloys are ductile and are rolled, to foils using an intermediate vacuum anneal. The thickness of the foil is of from about 2 to 6 mils. The alloys composition and their flow temperatures are given in Table 1.

For example alloys 4 and 8 above are useful for brazing ceramics to ferrous base alloys such as brazing alumina to an iron cobalt alloy known as Sonar. Alloys 5 and 10 above are useful for brazing superalloys such asInconel. Alloys 7 and 9 are useful for brazing stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel. While there haybedn shown and described what are at present considered the preferred emobdiments of the invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the inventions as defined by the appended claims.
