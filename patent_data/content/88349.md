# FINISH GRINDING METHODS AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
A system for finish grinding monitors the actual radius of the workpiece and feeds the grinding wheel into the workpiece at a decreasing feed rate as a desired final radius of the workpiece is approached and terminates the feeding at the desired final radius of the workpiece. In a preferred embodiment, a truing element is simultaneously fed into the grinding wheel at a rate that varies as a function of the decreasing feeding rate of the grinding wheel. The truing element is advanced in accordance with the desired ma terial removal rate from the grinding wheel by truing and the wear rate of the grinding wheel due to grinding. The grind ing wheel is advanced in accordance with the decreasing feed rate of the wheel into the workpiece and the rate at which material is removed from the grinding wheel due to truing.
