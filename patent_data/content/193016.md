# CUVETTE HANDLING CUVETTE HANDLING

## Abstract
An analysis system of the concurrent type has a multicuvette unit supply station, a loading station, an analysis station, and transport mechanism for transporting cuvette units in correlated orientation between the several stations. Each cuvette unit includes mechanical interlock structure that cooperates with orientation structure at each of the several stations and with orientation structure carried by the transport mechanism so that continuity of cuvette orientation information is maintained throughout loading and concurrent analysis of the several samples in the cuvette unit.
