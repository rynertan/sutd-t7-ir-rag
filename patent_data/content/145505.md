# DRAINAGE AND INFUSION CATHETERS HAVING A CAPILLARY SLEEVE FORMING A RESERVOIR FOR A FLUID ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT

## Abstract
A catheter for drainage of or infusion into a body cavity. The catheter comprises an elongated tubular shaft having a proximal end provided with at least one port near the proxi mal end and intended to be located in the body cavity. The catheter has an open distal end for connection to a drain, suction conduit or infusion line. A sleeve is mounted about the shaft extending along a portion at least of the internal body surface contacting part thereof between its distal and proximal ends. The sleeve forms a substantially concentric fluid reservoir between the drainage tube and the sleeve. Filling means are provided at the distal end of the shaft for supplying to the reservoir a fluid antimicrobial agent cap able of controlled passage through the sleeve by diffusion. The inner surface of the sleeve is provided with a plurality of longitudinally extending capillary channels or grooves providing uniform distribution of the fluid antimicrobial agent within the reservoir and throughout the length of the reservoir.
