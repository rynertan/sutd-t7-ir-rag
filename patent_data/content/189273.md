# FIBER OPTIC NETWORK WITH REDUCED COUPLING LOSSES

## Abstract
In order to avoid coupling losses, a fiber optic network employs wavelength sensitive devices to couple signals to a bus and split signals from the bus. A terminal device connected to the bus has an optical transmitter which produces signals at a wavelength that is different from the wavelengths employed in optical transmitters of other terminal devices connected to the bus. Furthermore the light is modulated to obtain a frequen cy channel identifying one or more terminal devices which are to receive messages from the bus. The bus is connected to a repeater which translates between wavelength and frequency channel. Frequency channels may be obtained by amplitude modulating or frequency modulating the light.
