Suitable punch and die tooling 30 is provided for backing up the partially formed can end surrounding the tubular portion 20 and forcing the same into cooperating relation with a curl insert 52 , simultaneously to flare the tubular portion 20 and to form on the end of the tubular portion an out turned curl 28 . The relationship of the tooling is such that the extent of the flared neck thus formed is accurately controlled.
