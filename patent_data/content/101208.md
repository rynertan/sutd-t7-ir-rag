# Keyboards.

## Abstract
A keyboard sub assembly for a typewriter has a base board 1 formed with a plurality of upstanding projections 3 which receive keys 4 with a snap action. Each key 4 is a push fit onto the corresponding projection 3 , and each key 4 is retained on the baseboard 1 by means of a lug 15 having a lip 17 which snap engages within a recess 12 on the underside of the baseboard 1 . A coil compression spring 18 is interposed between each key 4 and the corresponding projection 3 . The sub assembly of the baseboard 1 and the keys 4 can be assembled into a deck 29 with a push fit, as a result of the baseboard having projecting lugs 27 which snap engage within slots 32 formed in the deck 29 . The keys 4 shroud the projections 3 so as to prevent foreign matter reaching the underside of the baseboard 1 .
