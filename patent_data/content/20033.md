# Cycle derailleur with axially fixed pulley.

## Abstract
A cycle derailleur for use in switching a drive chain between different sprockets of a multi stage sprocket assembly for changing gear which derailleur comprises a fixing member 1 a support member 2 connected to said fixing member 1 so as to be movable relative thereto a return spring means 16 disposed for acting between said fixing member 1 and support member 2 a change over frame 4 pivotally supported on said support member 2 via a first generally horizontally extending, in use, shaft 5 a coiled spring means 21 arranged for acting between said support member 2 and said change over frame 4 for tensioning a drive chain of the cycle in use of the derailleur a first pulley 6 rotatably mounted around said horizontally extending shaft 5 and a second pulley 8 rotatably supported on the change over frame 4 by means of a second generally horizontally extending shaft 8 substantially parallel to said first shaft 5 . In order to maintain an axially fixed position of drive chain entry to the derailleur, the support member is connected to said fixed member via a third, generally vertically extending, in use, shaft 3 , the principal, rotational axis of said first shaft 5 intersecting, substantially at right angles, an extension of the principal, rotational axis of said third shaft 3 , whereby the position of the first pulley 6 in an axial direction thereof is maintained substantially fixed during pivoting of the change over frame 4 about said third shaft 3 for gear changing.
