# Process and apparatus of manufacturing an electroweldable socket.

## Abstract
An electroweldable socket 2 comprising a conducting wire 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 27 or gauze 34 near the inner wall of the socket, the socket 2 being manufactured by feeding conducting metal wire 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 27 or gauze 34 to a transverse extrusion head 22 of an extruder 21 and cutting the extruded pipe from the extruder to a socket 2. Conducting wire may be fed to the extrusion head 22 after having been wound to a helical spiral, the helical spiral may also be formed in the extrusion head 22 or supplied accommoda ted in an outer groove 40 of a thin walled tube 42 having a helically extending outer groove 40. The wire may also be supplied as a hose 37 assembled from said wires. Gauze is supplied in a pipe form obtained from a strip 34. The wire may comprise sections of helical spirals of mutually different pitch. Windings or groups of windings may be short circuited. The socket is provided with connections 4 for connecting the wire 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 27 to an electrical source. A device for manufacturing the socket comprises an extruder 21 with a transverse extrusion head 22 and an orifice 26 for supplying conducting wire 3, 27 or gauze 34 to the extrusion head 22. The device further comprises a calibrating head 23, a cooling device 24 a draw bench and a shortening device 33.
