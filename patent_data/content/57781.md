# Process and apparatus for recovering hydrocarbons from air hydrocarbon vapour mixtures.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for recovering hydrocarbons from an air hydrocarbon vapour mixture. The air hydrocarbon vapour mixture is caused to flow through a first bed 12, 14 of solid adsorbent, whereby the hydrocarbons are removed from the mixture and a residue gas stream by substantially hydrocarbon free air is vented to atmosphere and a second bed 14, 12 of solid adsorbent having hydrocarbons adsorbed thereon is desorbed by applying vaccum thereto using a liquid seal vacuum pump 72 . The flow pattern is cyclically changed, so that air hydrocarbon vapour mixture is fed through a bed of solid adsorbent which has just been regenerated. Use of a vacuum pump 72 ensures that a major portion of the hydrocarbons is de sorbed. Subsequently feeding a small quantity of heated hydrocarbon free air into the beds at 66 causes additional hydrocarbons to be stripped therefrom. The air hydrocarbon vapour mixture produced in the regeneration of the beds is contacted with a liquid absorbent whereby a major portion of the hydrocarbons are absorbed therefrom and recovered. The feed of the liquid absorbent is divided into two first and second streams, the first stream being heated by passing it in heat exchange relation with the seal liquid of the vacuum pump which is thus cooled. The first stream is then fed to the absorber at a location below that at which the second relatively cool stream is fed. A liquid coolant is passed through heat transfer coils 21, 23 in the adsorber beds 12, 14 to prevent excessive heating thereof.
