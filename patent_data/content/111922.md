# Sintered ceramic body.

## Abstract
A sintered ceramic body has a surface layer containing yttrium silicate, cristobalite and silicon nitride, and mainly consists of silicon nitride. The silicon ceramic body is manufactured by preparing a composition containing a silicon nitride powder and an yttrium oxide powder, forming and sintering the composition, and heat treating the sintered body in an oxidizing atmosphere. The ceramic body has a high mechanical strength over its entire surface and has little variation in mechanical strength.
