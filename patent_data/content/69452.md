# Articles or parts resistant to stress corrosion cracking.

## Abstract
Articles or parts which are resistant to stress corrosion cracking for use in aqueous environments such as nuclear reactors comprise an age hardened nickel based alloy con taining 0.05 to 0.2 zirconium. The invention is particularly usefully applied to springs or bolts which require a yield strength 0.2 offset of at least 689.47 MN mÂ² at room temperature.
