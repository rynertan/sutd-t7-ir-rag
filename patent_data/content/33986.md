# A process for the upgrading of coal.

## Abstract
Process for the separation of coal from an aqueous slurry of a coal ash mixture with varying ash content by agglomerating the coal with a binder and separating the agglomerates from a remaining ash suspension, in which process the total mass flow of the coal ash mixture in the siurry and the mass flow of the ash in suspension are measured and the amount of binder is adjusted to the difference of said flows.
