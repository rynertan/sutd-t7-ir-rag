Representative preferred compounds of its present invention have a water solubility of around 100 mg ml or more compared with less than 1 mg ml for mebendazole. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by standard methods for the preparation of such guanidine type compounds. According to a further feature of the invention, we ptovide a process for the preparation of a compound or salt as defined above, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula H2N CH2 mR2 with a compound of the formulaEMI5.1 whereafter the resulting compound of the formulaEMI5.2 is if desired subjected to one or more of the following reaction steps in any appropriate order, where, in the above defined reaction and the following steps, the various symbols R, R2, R3, R5, R6, R7 and n are as defined above and X is X defined above. a Hydrolytic removal of the group NHCO2R7 to yield a compound having an NH2 group in the guanidino group b Acylation of a compound having an NH2 group in the guanidino group to a compound having instead an NHCONR5R6 group c Reaction of a compound having an NH2 group in the guanidino group with an inorganic isocyanate and then if desired with an alkylating agent, or with an alkyl isocyanate d Oxidation of a compound having an R3Ssubstituent in the phenyl group to a compound having aR3SO or R3SO2 substituent e Reduction of a compound having a 2 N02 group, if desired under alkylating conditions or with subsequent alkylation, to a compound having a 2 amino group f Acylation of a compound having a 2 amino group g Isolation of the final compound of formulaI as such or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A convenient intermediate for the preparation of compounds of formula I is an N lower alkoxycarbonylN 2 X 4 or 5 substituted phenyl N alkylacid guanidine, i.e. a compound of the formulaEMI6.1 N Alkoxycarbonyl compounds of formula II can be hydrolyzed according to well known procedures e.g.with a base such as sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as water or methanol to prepare the corresponding guanidines i.e. the CO2R7 group is replaced by H . Such guanidines can be treated with a diloweralkylcarbamyl chloride, e.g. dimethyl carbamyl chloride, according to techniques known in the art to obtain the corresponding N diloweralkylcarbamyl N 2 nitro 4 or 5 substituted phenyl N substituted alkyl guanidine. N Loweralkylcarbamyl3guanidines, e.g.methylcarbamyl guanidines, can be prepared by treating guanidines having H instead of CO2R7 with potassium cyanate followed by alkylation with a diloweralkyl sulfate, e.g. dimethylsulfate, or with a lower alkyl halide, e.g. methyl chloride or methyl bromide.Alternatively, N loweralkylcarbamyl guanidines can be prepared by treating guanidines having H instead of Co2R7 or the sodium salts thereof with an alkyl isocyanate. If in the foregoing reaction alkylation is omitted and the product of the potassium cyanate reaction is hydrolysed with acid, e.g., hydrochloric, acetic or sulfuric acid, then the product will be an N carbamyl guanidine. 2 Nitro compounds of formula II can be used as intermediates in well known reactions to prepare compounds of the present invention, i.e. compounds wherein the substituent at the 2 position in the phenyl ring is of the formula NR8R9. For example, 2 lower alkylamino 4 or 5 substituted phenyl compounds may be prepared by hydrogenation catalytic or chemical of compounds of formulaII, followed by alkylation with a di lower alkyl sulfate or a lower alkyl halide as described above. Similarly, the lower alkylamino compounds prepared as in the immediately preceding paragraph can be further alkylated with a di lower alkyl sulfate or a lower alkyl halide to obtain the 2 di loweralkylamino 4 or 5 substituted phenyl compounds of formula I. Alternatively, the conversion of the 2 nitro compound to the corresponding 2 alkylamino or 2 dialkylamino compound can be carried out by hydrogenating the 2 nitro compound using an aliphatic aldehyde and platinum oxide as catalyst. Zor example, using formaldehyde in a 1 1 molar ratio to the nitro compound will yield the methylamine derivative, and using formaldehyde in a 2 1 molar ratio will yield the dimethylamine compound. Compounds of formula I wherein one of R8 andR9 is lower alkyl and the other of R8 and R9 is lower alkoxyearbonyl can be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate 2 loweralkylamino 4 or 5 substitutedphenyl compound with the appropriately substituent acyl halide, e.g. methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, butyl chloroformate, 4 chlorophenyl chloroformate, 3methylphenyl chloroformate, or 4 methoxyphenyl chloroformate. Compounds of formula I wherein R8 and R9 are lower alkyl carbonyl or optionally substituted benzoyl can be prepared by the reaction of the appropriate carbonyl chloride e.g. benzoyl chloride or acetyl chloride with the desired 2 amino 4 or 5 substitutedphenyl compounds according to procedures known in the art. Compounds of formula I wherein R8 or R9 is sulfolower alkyl or carboxy lower alkyl can be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding fl halo alkyl sulfonic or carboxylic acid salt with the intermediate formed by the hydrogenation of compounds of formula It. For example, the reaction of a hydrogenated compound of Cormula II with 2 chloroethane sulfonic acid sodium salt produces the taurine derivative i.e. the N 2 sulfonic acid ethylamino 4 or 5 substituted phenyl compounds . It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that successive modifications of compounds of formula II may be used to prepare compounds of formulaI. Compounds of formula II can be prepared by treating an appropriately substituted 2 X aniline with an alkoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate, reacting the resulting product with a base such as sodium hydride or sodium methoxide and a dialkylsulfate or an alkylhalide to obtain the S alkyl isothiourea, and reacting this with an Q aminoalkylacid e.g., taurine, 3 amino 1 propanesulfonic acid, 2 aminoethylphosphoric acid or 4aminobutyric acid and a base such as sodium hydroxide. A preferred embodiment of this reaction scheme, in which X is NO2, is shown below EMI9.1 EMI10.1 Compounds of formula III either are known in the art or may be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Preferred compounds of formula I wherein R is 5 0 mR3 may be prepared by well known procedures from the corresponding SR3 compounds by treating the thio substituent with an oxidizing agent such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, sodium m periodate or hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid. Amino groups in the starting material may be protected during the oxidation by the addition of a reagent such as trifluoroacetic acid. Treatment with one equivalent of oxidizing agent will yield the SoR3 sulfinyl compound while treatment with two equivalents will yield the SO2R3 compound sulfonyl .This oxidation may be carried out at one of several stages in the preparation of the compounds as shown below, wherein the preparation of a sulfinyl compound is described EMI10.2 EMI11.1 The nitro group can, of course, be replaced with any appropriate group comprised within X , especially and N diloweralkyl group. 2 Amino compounds of formula II can be prepared as follows For example, 3,4 dinitrochlorobenzene may be treated with liquid ammonia in a solvent such as ethanol to obtain 2 nitro 5 chloro aniline, which may then be treated with acetic anhydride in a solvent such as pyridine at 0 5 C to yield 2 nitro 5chloroacetanilide. The 2 nitro 5 chloro acetanilide may then be converted to the corresponding 2 dialkylamino 5chloroacetanilide by hydrogenating the nitro compound using platinum on carbon as catalyst in the presence of an aliphatic aldehyde 2 1 molar ratio to the nitro compound . The acetanilide can be hydrolyzed with a reagent such as sodium methoxide in a solvent such as methanol to give the corresponding 2 dialkylamino 5chloroaniline. The chloroaniline can be treated with an appropriate reagent to give a 2 dialkylamino 5substituted aniline, e.g. the chloroaniline reacted with 1 propanethiol and sodium hydroxide in dimethylformamide water at room temperature will yield 2dialkylamino 5 propylthioaniline. This aniline may then be treated as the compound of formula III in the foregoing reaction scheme to obtain a 2 dialkylaminocompound analogous to the compound of formula II. Metal salts, alkyl ammonium salts and other pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared according to methods well known to those skilled in the art.

Based on experimentation, proper dosages for curing various infections can be determined. Compounds of this invention may be administered in various formulations well known to those skilled in the human and veterinary medical arts, e.g., solutions, capsules, tablets and injectable preparations. In addition, for veterinary use, the compounds may be administered as feed or drinking water additive preparations. For injectable preparations, the active ingredient is admixed with suitable sterile carriers such as sterile water and isotonic saline solution. Suitable clinical formulations containing the compounds of this invention can be administered orally in the form of tablets, capsules, elixirs and the like. The active compound is compounded with inert carriers such as, for example, gums, starches and sugars or it may be incorporated into gelatin capsules or formulated into elixirs which have the advantage of being amenable to manipulations in flavor by the addition of flavoring agents. Anthelmintic formulations particularly useful for, but not limited to, veterinary use comprise the compounds of this invention in ready to use liquid suspensions or wettable or water dispersible powders which are dissolved in water prior to use. The following examples show particularly useful formulations. In the examples, the term Drug refers to a compound in accordance with this invention.A. Liquid suspension formulation A liquid suspension formulation may contain from 50 to 55 w. v. grams liters of the active compound together with a dispersing agent and stabilizing agent. A typical formulation is as follows Drug 50 to 55 parts by weightDispersing agent ............... 1 2 to 2 parts by weightStabilizing agent ................ 1 to 3 parts by weightPreservative ........................ as requiredWater ............................... Sufficient to make 100 volumes.Suitable dispersing agents are those containing sulphonate groups, for example sodium lignin sulphonate, or the sulphonated phenol or naphthol formaldehyde polymers. Bentonite may be employed as the stabilizing agent, although it is possible to use such protective colloids as carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium alginate and the like. The formulations can be prepared by mixing the active compound and water containing dissolved dispersing agents very vigorously by means of suitable mechanical mixing equipment. B. Powder formulation A wettable or water dispersible powder formulation may contain about 90 to 95 w. w. of the active compound together with a wetting agent and dispersing agent. A diluent such as kaolin can also be added if a concentration below about 98 w. w. is required. An anti foaming agent and, in some cases, a stabilizing agent may be present.A typical formulation is as follows Drug 90 to 95 parts by weightWetting agent .................. 1 2 to 4 parts by weightStabilizing agent ................ 0 to 2 parts by weightAnti foaming agent .................. 0.01 to 1 by weightWater ............................... 0 to 5 by weightSuitable wetting agents are the non ionic alkylphenolethylene oxide adducts, such as an octylphenol or nonylphenol condensed with ten moles of ethylene oxide, or anionic materials, such as the synthetic aryl alkyl sulphonates, or sodium dibutyl napthalene sulphonate.In general, about 1 w. w. wetting agent is required.The anti foaming agent employed may be either a silicone or such materials as ethyl hexanol, octanol and the like and the stabilizing agent may be chosen from bentonite or the water soluble gums as discussed above. Wettable or water dispersible powder formulations are prepared by careful and adequate mixing of the active compound with other ingredients with or without the addition of some water using typical powder blending equipment such as a ribbon blender. The powder is dissolved in water by the user before application in the field. C.
