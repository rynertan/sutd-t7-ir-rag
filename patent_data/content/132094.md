# Aromatic polysulfone resin composition.

## Abstract
An aromatic polysulfone resin composition comprises 20 to 80 by weight of an aromatic polysulfone, 10 to 70 by weight of a fibrous reinforcement or an inorganic filler, and 0.5 to 20 by weight of a fluororesin. The aromatic polysulf one resin composition has heat resistance, strength, stiffness, flame resistance and processability superior to known sulfone resins and is particularly useful as an engineering plastics material.
