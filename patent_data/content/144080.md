# RECORDING AND REPRODUCING SYSTEM FOR COLOR VIDEO SIGNAL

## Abstract
A color video signal recording system comprises means for producing a quadrature two phase balanced modulated color signal by subjecting a subcarrier to quadrature two phase balanced modulation by two color signals, means for producing a demodulation purpose reference phase signal which has the same frequency as that of the subcarrier and which is to be frequency interleaved with the quadrature two phase balanced modulated color signal, means for multiplexing the quadrature two phase balanced modulated color signal and the demodulation purpose reference phase signal together with a luminance signal, and means for recording the multiplex signal on a recording medium after subjecting it to angle modulation. In a reproducing system, the reproduced signal is subjected to angle demodulation after being limited in its amplitude, and the luminance signal, the quadrature two phase balanced modulated color signal and the reference phase signal are separated from the demodulated signal, the quadrature two phase balanced modulated signal being then demodulated on the basis of the separated reference phase signal.
