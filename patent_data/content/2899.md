# Method for preparing aluminosilicates and their use as catalyst supports and catalysts.

## Abstract
Aluminosilicates containing an organic nitrogen cation are prepared by mixing sources of silica, alumina and an alkali metal, water and either mono ethanolamine or mono propanolamine, or a derivative, or the precursors or a combination thereof and maintaining the mixture at a temperature in the range from 80 to 210 C and a pressure in the range from 70 to 400 psig for over 4 hours. In a preferred embodiment the alkanolamines are prepared in situ by reaction of the corresponding alkylene oxide with ammonia. Aluminosilicates so prepared can be used without modification as catalysts and catalyst supports. Catalytic activity can be enhanced by, for example, reducing the sodium content or impregnating with a compound of one or more metals belonging to Groups IB, IIB, IIIA, IVA, VA and VIII or reaction with a compound of one or more nonmetals of Group IIIA and VA of the Periodic Table.
