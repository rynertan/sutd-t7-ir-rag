# DYNAMIC ULTRASONIC LAMINATING APPARATUS HAVING POST BONDING PRESSURE ROLL, AND CONCOMITANT METHOD

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for bonding together juxtaposed webs which are subject to being ultrasonically bonded together such as, for example, thermoplastic films or non woven thermoplastic webs or elastomeric films to form a laminate as the webs are being driven forward at a relatively high velocity. The apparatus includes an ultrasonic horn and a power rotated anvil cylinder which define a bonding passageway therebetween, and a rotatable pressure roll which is biased towards the anvil adjacent the downstream end of the bonding passageway to apply a predetermined level of compressive force to the bonded regions of the laminate issuing from the passageway before the bonds in the bonded regions become fully set upon cooling. In a preferred apparatus embodiment of the invention the anvil has a relief type bonding pattern on its circumferential surface and the pressure roll is sufficiently rigid and so configured and disposed that substantially only the portions of the laminate juxtaposed raised elements of the bonding pattern are subjected to such post bonding compression.
