## Description
This invention is directed to an apparatus for the continuous production of a polyurethane froth. Apparatus for generating foam is well known and has been widely used primarily for applying the foam to textile materials, and the like. The foam composition is applied to the substrate and as it contacts the substrate, the bubbles burst and the composition is absorbed by the substrate. The foam is generated in an apparatus which generally consists of a mechanical agitator capable of mixing metered quantities of a gas, such as air, and a liquid chemical composition containing the chemical that is to be applied to the substrate, and converting the mixture to a foam. However, a structurally stable polyurethane froth could not be produced using the foam generating apparatus of the prior art. U.S. Patent 3,821,130 describes flexible polyurethane foams prepared from inert gas frothed mixtures of a polyether polyol end capped with at least 2 moles of ethylene oxide per active hydrogen atom, a polyiso cyanate containing material and a catalyst for urethane formation. The polyether polyol and polyisocyanate are employed in quantities so as to provide an NCO OH ratio of from about 0.85 1 to about 2.0 1. The flexible polyurethane foams produced have densities below about 15 lbs. ft.3. This patent states that the foams do not require the use of a volatilizing blowing or foaming agent or a silicone oil cell control agent. The foams of the patentare prepared by mechanically inducing the inert gas into the urethane forming composition producing a froth which is or can be dispensed into a suitable mold or onto a suitable substrate whereupon the frothed mixture sets into a cellular polyurethane product. The patent states that the conventional froth resulting from the mechanical in troduction of inert gas into the urethane forming mixture does not undergo any subsequent significant expansion other than that caused by any thermal expansion of the inert gas employed which is very small, i.e., less than about 1 percent by volume. The patent, in column 3, describes the various methods of preparing the froth. These methods include mechanically whipping or blending air or other inert gases into the mixture of urethane forming components with a mixer fitted with a blade designed to mechanically whip the air into said mixture. Another method comprises feeding a stream composed of a mixture of the urethane forming com ponents or separate streams of the urethane forming combo nents and a stream of air into a froth generator mixer ,where the frothed composition which emerges from the mixer is directed into a mold or onto a substrate where the frothed composition thermosets into a flexible polyurethane foam.Still another method described in the patent is to feed the inert gas and all of the urethane forming components, except for the catalyst, into the froth generator mixer and subseuentlymix the catalyst with the resultant froth in a mixer, such as a static mixer, and then direct the froth into a mold or onto.a substrate. In Examples 1 to 130f the patent, the polyether polyol and isocyanate containing compound are placed into a Hobart mixer equipped with a blade for whipping air into the mixture and whipping at a high rate of speed for a time sufficient to provide a froth, usually two minutes. After the whipping is com plete, a catalyst is added and the resulting froth mixed for an additional 45 seconds and then poured into an open container to cure. However, this patent does not describe apparatus for the continuous production of a froth. THE INVENTION This invention is directed to an apparatus for the continuous production of a curable polyurethane froth, which apparatus comprises separate sources of a polyol, an isocyanate, a catalyst and an inert gas, means including separate conduits for feeding said polyol, isocyanate and inert gas separately and under pressure at controlled flow rates from said sources to a mixing device containing inlet openings to receive said polyol, isocyanate and inert gas, means for mixing said polyol, isocyanate and inert gas to produce a froth, and an outlet opening for the resulting froth, means for delivering the froth from said mixing device to a second mixing device, a conduit for feeding the catalyst under pressure at a controlled flow rate to the second mixing device, and means for mixing the froth and catalyst, said mixing device containing inlet openings to receive the froth and catalyst and an outlet opening for the resul ting catalyzed froth and means for delivering the catalyzed froth from the mixing device onto a substrate. It has been found that the apparatus of this invention produces a polyurethane froth which is structurally stable and easily workable at ambient temperatures. The froth has a density of from about 18 to about 45 lbs. ft.3, and preferably, from about 20 to about 35 lbs. ft.3. The froth foam produced has utility as, for example, an adhesive for bonding panels to framing, particularly for bonding dry wall panels to wooden framing a flame retardant insulating material insulating material around doors and windows patching wood patching concrete patching cinder blocks it can be formed into a temporary walkway or road over soft ground a highway mediam divider post hole filler material to eliminate contact of the post with the earth since it provides almost instant support covering, protecting and insulating wrap for buried piping a packing material repair holes, dents in vehicles a dry wall joint sealer. The cured cellular polyurethane has an essentially closed cell structure. The cells are essentially spherical and less than about 300 microns in diameter. The cell diameter ranges from about 5 to about 300 microns. The size of the cell which forms the skin surface of the polyurethane foam has a dimension which is essentially equivalent to the size of the cell in the mid interior of the foam. Thus, from surface to surface, the size of the cells of the polyurethane foam, exclusive of those cm which are adhesively bonded to a substrate and are contiguous thereto, are essentially uniform. Such uniformity is reflective of the average uniformity that one would find in the mid section of such a polyurethane foam.The density of the cured foam is approximately equal to the density of the froth prior to curing. The cured polyurethane is resilient, sandable and can be easily decorated. In order to describe more definitively many of the embodiments of this invention, reference is made to Figure I which schematically depicts a flow diagram of a desirable embodiment of this invention, and Figure 2 which depicts a side view of vessels 29 and 30 of Figure 1. In discussing Figures 1 and 2 the descriptions are purely illustrative and are not intended to be in any sense limiting. To those skilled in the art to which this invention relates, many changes in construction and different embodiments will suggest themselves without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The polyol package the polyol package will herein after and for purposes of this discussion be referred to as the polyol contained in vessels 29 and 30, isocyanate contained in vessel 28 and catalyst contained in vessel 27 are pumped to mixers by pumps 34, 33 and 32, respectively. These pumps are driven by a motor 35. The utilization of a single motor to drive the pumps assures a fixed, constant, ratio of the materials from vessels 27, 28, 29 and 30, since all pumps are of a positive displacement type. The polyol is drawn from vessels 29 and 30 and pumped at a constant rate by pump 34 whose output is fixed to the drive motor speed. The pump may be a Moyno unit manufactured byRobbins and Meyers Corporation . The output may vary from about 100 to about 200 grams or more per minute by varying the drive speed and sizing the components. Isocyanate is drawn from tank 28 through line 55 and optionally, through filter 57 which removes any impurities or previously reacted material. Pump 33 may be a gear type unit manufactured by Zenith Corporation, whose output of 30 to 60 g min. or more is determined by the speed of drive motor 35. This output is carried through lines 59, 61 and 64 and vaLve 62. At various times during the froth generation process it may be desirable to discontinue isocyanate flow without interrupting the flow of the other systems.This capability is embodied in valves 62 and 66 and lines 67 and 65. By blocking flow through valve 62 the output of pump 33 reaches a pressure of about 100 psi which causes check valve 66 to open passing fluid through line 65.This fluid is then recirculated through filter 57 and pump 33 until the drive motor 35 is stopped or valve 62 is reopened. Similarly, catalyst is drawn from tank 27 through line 77, to be pumped and metered by the single piston pump 32. The output flow of from about 0.5 to about 5 g min. may be recirculated by closing valve 81 which causes flow through lines 84 and 83, when output pressure causes check valve 85 to open automatically. The chemical supply tanks 27, 28, 29 and 30 are pressurized to minimize the possibility of contamin ation and reduce the poer output reauirement of motor 35. This is accomplished by introducing gas from tank 1 through a set of pressure reducing valves 5 and 9 and a control valve, 11, through line 20 to the top of each tank. The chemical fluids thus reach the same pressure as line 20, about 60 psi, to facilitate fluid flow through the inlet lines to each pump thus minimizing the possibility of cavitation and unreliable metering. Froth generation is accomplished mechanically by a mixer 47, driven by motor 48. Air is drawn from tank 1, through valves 5, 18, 70 and 73 and lines 17, 68 69, 72 and 74, such that a constant flow rate is maintained. This i6 air and the polyol are introduced into the mixer via line 46. Isocyanate is added via liner 64 and the polyol and air is mixed and whipped into a froth.Line 64 is of a small diameter to maintain a high fluid velocity and minimize any backs low of reactive material which could cause a blockage. The urethane froth is delivered by line 75 to a catalyst injector 76. Catalyst flows via line 82 to the catalyst injector. Line 82 is of a small diameter to minimize elastic effects of the line and fluid, enhancing consistent system operation. The froth with catalyst passes into a static mixer, 86, which blends said components to a uniform homogeneous state. The curable froth may be applied directly to a substrate or may be applied with an applicator 87, whose purpose is to distribute the froth into a preferred configuration. Specifically, with reference to the Figure 1, vessel 1 is a source of dry gaseous material, which is preferably dry nitrogen or dry air. Gas from vessel 1 passes through lines 2 and 4 at a pressure of about 2700 psig and then through pressure reducing valve 5 where it is reduced to about 200 psig. A portion of the gas passes via lines 6 and 7 to pressure reducing valve 9 which reduces the pressure to about 60 to 70 psig. The other portion of the gas passes via lines 6 and 17 to pressure reducing valve 18 which reduces the pressure to about 100 to 150 psig. Pressure switch 8 monitors the gas supply level. Gage 3 displays the gas pressure. The gas from pressure reducing valve 9 passes via line 10 to direction control valve 11, then via lines 12 and 20 a portion goes via line 26 to form pressure on the contents of vessel 27 a portion via line 25 to exert a pressure on the contents of vessel 28 a portion via lines 21 and 22 to exert a pressure on the contents of vessel 29 and a portion via lines 21 and 24 to exert a pressure on the contents of vessel 30. In an optional embodiment, gas passes from valve 11 via lines 12 and 14 through pressure reducing valve 15 where it is reduced to about 5 psi and flows through line 16 where it exerts a pressure on the contents of vessel 93. he contents of vessel 93 comprise a cleaning or flushing solvent. When the process is started polyol contained in vessels 29 and or 30, isocyanate contained in vessel 28 and catalyst contained in vessel 27 are pumped to mixers by pumps 34, 33 and 32, respectively, which mixers are driven by motor 35. Specifically, polyol contained in vessels 29 and 30 pass via lines 36 and 31, respectively, then through lines 37, 38 and 41, through pump 34 and line 42 to mixer 47 which is driven by motor 48. Polyol in vessels 29 and 30 can be used concurrently or sequentially.In a preferred embodiment vessels 29 and 30 contain floating pistons 52 and 53. These pistons help completely empty the vessel especially when a viscous polyol is used. Additionally, the piston cuts off the supply of polyol when a vessel becomes empty so that flow from the second vessel can commence. Pressure switch 54 detects a difference in pressure to indicate that both tanks are empty. Vessel 40 is a reservoir for polyol. It is a one quart bladder accumulator. When the pumping process is started, the polyol from either vessel flows into accumulator 40 and fills it. When both vessels 29 and 30 are empty of polyol, pressure switch 54 is activated and polyol from vessel 40 flows at reduced pressure into pump 34 and into mixer 47 as previously described, to prevent cavitation during the shutdown sequence. Isocyanate is pumped into mixer 47 by passing from vessel 28 via lines 55 and 56 optionally through filter 57,via line 58 through pump 33,via lines 59 and 61, valve 62 and lines 63 and 64. At times, it may be desirable to discontinue the isocyanate flow without stopping the flow of the other components. In this optional system, flow is discontinued by closing valve 62 which causes the output of pump 33 to reach a pressure of about 100 psi which causes valve 66 to open and allows isocyanate to pass through line 65. The isocyanate is then recirculated through filter 57 and pump 33 until motor 35 stops or valve 62 is reopened. Air is supplied to mixer 47 to produce a froth.Air is supplied from tank 1 to mixer 47 by passing via lines 2 and 4, valve 5, lines 6 and 17, pressure regulator 18, lines 68 and 69, direction control valve 70, line 72, flow regulator 73, line 74 where the air meets with the polyol from line 42 at tee 43, then both materials pass through line 42 into the mixer 47. At the same time isocyanate is flowing into mixer 47, as described, supra. The froth formed is delivered from mixer 47 to catalyst injector 76 via line 75. The catalyst isde livered to catalyst injector 76 by passing it from vessel 27 through lines 77 and 78 through pump 32, via lines 79 and 80, through valve 81 and via line 82. In an optional embodiment, the catalyst maybe recirculated by closing valve 81 which causes flow through valve 85 and lines 83 and 78 when the pressure causes valve 85 to open automatically. The preferred catalyst injector is described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 115,623 , titlec Apparatus for Mixing Chemical Components filed on January 28, 1980 . by B. Pinkston, and assigned to the same assignee as this invention.The apparatus described in said Application Serial No. 115,623 is an apparatus for producing a mixture of chemical components which comprises an elongated housing containing a a tube extending there through having at least one inlet means for supplying at least one component into said tube whereby said components flow from said inlet means to outlet means at the other end of said tube b inlet means for supplying at least one component either reactive with one or more components of a or catalyzing the reaction of two or more components of a , said inlet means in communication with an annular groove within a conical member which receives said component s , c means for distributing said component from the annular groove to a plurality of grooves in said conical member, said grooves directing the component s into the flow of the component s of a in said tube. Static mixer 86 mixes the catalyst and the froth.The froth can then be deposited onto a substrate by an applicator 87. Applicator 87 can arrange the foam in a preferred configuration. In an optional embodiment of this invention, a solvent may be used to flush the following mixer 47 line 64 carrying materials from the isocyanate vessel line 75 which carries froth fron mixer 47 catalyst injector 76 mixer 86 and applicator 87. Air is passed to vessel 93, to pressurize the solvent therein,.from regulator 11 through line 12, tee 19, line 14, regulator 15 which reduces the pressure to about 5 psi as required through line 16 to create a pressure on the contents of vessel 93. To prepare the solvent flush system for use, air from line 101 is directed by valve 103 into line 104, filling and pressurizing cavity 94 in cylinder 105 Cylinder 105 has a 2 inch bore . This causes piston rod assembly 95 to move and hence increasing the volume of cavity 96 in cylinder 108. Cylinder 108 has a 4 inch bore. As that volume is increased, solvent is drawn via line 88, check valve 90 and line 107 filling cavity 96. This system is ready to flush. When it is desired to flush the system, valve 103 is electrically driven to its other position such that the air from line 101 now passes into line 102 to fill and pressurize cavity 97.The pressure exerted in 97 then decreases the volume of cavity 96 causing the solvent contained therein to pass through line 109 through check valve 110 and lines 111 and 64 into mixer 47 which flushes out the reactive materials therein cleaning the mixer anddown stream components ultimately existing through applicator 87.Preferred solvents are halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, or ketones,such as acetone or methylethylketone. The total motion for piston rod assembly 95 from end to end is 3 inches. Figure 2 is a side view of a vesseL, depicted as 29 and 30 in Figure 1 which is used to hold the polyol package. Tank cylinder 201 is a seven gallon aluminum cylinder containing a top 207 to which handle 208 is attached. The top can be removed and the polyol added thereto. O rings 205 provide a seal to prevent materials from leaking out between the top and sides of the cylinder.Air inlet 203 receives air under pressure and creates a pres t sure on piston 206 forcing it against the contents of the vessel and causing the contents to be forced through suction tube 207 through outlet 204 and into the system. When the cylinder has been emPtied of its contents, piston 205 is in position A, and seals the system by sealing suction tube 202. When the catalyst is injected into the froth and then mixed with the froth in a mixer, the time to cure the froth is greatly reduced. Using this technique of catalyzing the froth the major portion of the cure can take place in about 90 seconds in mass and in about 30 to about 50 minutes in a thin layer. Additionally, besides accelerating cure, said catalyst addition preserves the working life of the froth in the hose precluding gelation or building up of highly viscous or gelled material on the wall of the hose. The hose carries the froth from the mixer to the substrate on which it is deposited. Further, it has been found by adding the catalyst post expansion of the froth is minimized after it has been spread over a substrate, such as a joint formed by the abutting relationship of two wallboards, for example. When isocyanate reacts with moisture producing C02,postfoaming occurs resulting in an uneven surface. The catalyst addition, as described, results in an accelerated cure as the froth passes through the hose and is applied to the substrate, so that post foaming is essentially eliminated when polyol s with sufficiently low hygroscopicity are used. The process of preparing a curatle froth and a preferable frothable thermosett ing polyurethane forming composition are described in copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 115,629 titled A Frothable Polyurethane Composition and a Cellular Foam Produced Therefrom , filed on January 28, 1980 by B. Barth, et al. and assigned to the same assignee as this invention. As described in said application, the curable froth foam is prepared by mixing air or other gaseous substance with the polyol including thixotrope and one or more optional ingredients , and the isocyanate. Preferably the catalyst is added to the foam produced by mixing the gas, polyol including thixotrope and one or more optional ingredients and iso cyanate. Suitable gaseous substances which are employed in the present invention include any gaseous element, compound, or mixture thereof which exists in the gaseous state under standard conditions of temperature and pressure, i.e., 250C and one atmosphere, including for example, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and air, or mixtures thereof, provided such do not react with.or significantly dissolve into any of the urethane forming components. Dry nitrogen or dry air is the preferred gas. Specifically, in preparing the curable foam, the isocyanate, and the polyol containing thixotrope, and one or more of the optional ingredients are metered separately and in fixed pro.portions into a mixer, preferably an SKG or Oakes continuous mixer. The gaseous material under pressure may be metered into either the polyol or isocyanate stream or into both or it may be metered directly into the mixer containing the polyurethane forming components. A dense froth is formed in the mixer under a pressure which is above atmospheric pressure and from about 40 to about 150 psig.The froth is then fed from the mixer into a delivery tube. The froth expands in volume i.e. decreases in density as the estrained air bubbles expand with decreased pressure as the foam proceeds towards the outlet of the delivery tube. The catalyst is injected into the froth at a point downstream in the delivery tube and dispersed by passing the foam catalyst mixture through an in line mixer. The catalyzed froth is then directed onto a substrate. The preferable composition for use herein and as described in said U.S. Patent Application Serial No. D 12, 477 comprises a frothable thermosetting polyurethaneforming composition in which the density of the cured foam therefrom is essentially the same as the density of the froth composition, when cured such that at least one surface of the froth is exposed to the atmosphere, which composition comprises a a polyol, b a polyisocyanate, c a thixotroping agent, d an inert gas, e an amount of moisture available for reaction with the polyisocyanate that is less than that amount which would cause the composition to cure to a cellular polyurethane having a density which is not essentially the same density as that of the frothed composition. The composition includes a catalyst and optionally one or more of the following a surfactant, a moisture absorbing material, a filler, a flame retardant, a dye, a pigment, or any other ingredient which would introduce an insignificant amount of moisture into the composition. The composition as described in U.S. Patent Appli cation Serial No 115,629 is preferably used in the form of three packages , i.e., a polyol package which contains the polyol, thixotrope and one or more of the optional ingredients an isocyanate package which contains the isocyanate and a catalyst package which contains a catalyst which catalyzes the urethane forming reaction, and a solvent for the catalyst. An inert gas is added to produce a froth.

The alkylene oxides employed in producing polyoxyalkylene polyols normally have from 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Propylene oxide and mixtures of propylene oxide with ethylene oxide are preferred. The polyols listed above can be used per se as the active hydrogen compound. A preferred class of polyether polyols employed in this invention can be represented generally by the following formula RtOCnH2n zOH a wherein R is hydrogen or a polyvalent hydrocarbon radical a is an integer e.g., 1 or 2 to 6 to 8 equal to the valence of R, n in each occurrence is an integer from 2 to 4 inclusive preferably 3 and z in each occurrence is an integer having a value of from 2 to about 200, preferably from 15 to about 100. Additional active hydrogen containing materials are the polymers of cyclic esters having a reduced vicosity value of at least about 0.15, and desirably from about 0.2 to about 15, and higher. The preferred polymers of cyclic esters have a reduced viscosity value of from about 0.3 to about 10. These polymers are homopolymers or copolymers characterized as containing units of the formula EMI18.1 wherein each Rt,individually, is hydrogen, alkyl, halo, or alkoxy wherein A is an oxy group where x is an integer from 1 to 4 wherein c is an integer from 1 to 4 wherein b is an integer of zero or one the sum of x c b is at least 4 and not greater than 6 and the total number ofRegroups include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n butyl, secbutyl, t butyl, hexyl, chloro, bromo, iodo, methoxy, ethoxy, n butoxy, n hexoxy, 2 ethylhexoxy, dodecoxy, and the like. It is preferred that each R1 individually, be hydrogen, lower alkyl, e,g., methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isobutyl, and or lower alkoxy, e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, n butoxy, and the like. It is further preferred that the total number of carbon atoms in the R1substituents does not exceed eight. In one embodiment, preferred polymers of cyclic esters contain both recurring structural Unit 1 and units of the formula EMI19.1 wherein each R , individually, is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or chloroalkyl, or in which the two R variaables together with the ethylene moiety of the oxyethylene chain of Unit II form a saturated cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon ring having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, desirably from 5 to 6 carbon atoms and w is an integer of 1 or more, preferably 1 to 10.

The aforedescribed recurring Unit I is interconnected through the oxy group O of one unit with the carbonyl groupEMI20.1 of a second unit, i.e., the interconnection does not involve the direct bonding of two carbonyl groups.EMI20.2 On the other hand, the relatively low molecular weight cyclic ester polymers, e.g., those having reduced viscosity values below about 0.3 are characterized by end groups which can be hydroxyl or carboxyl. Cyclic ester polymers having sn average molecular weight of about 500 to about 2000 are preferred for use herein. The preparation of the cyclic ester polymers is well documented in the patent literature as exemplified byU.S. Pat. Nos. 3,021,309 through 3,021,317 3,169,945 and 2,962,524. Briefly, the process involves the polymerization of a mixture containing at least one cyclic ester monomer with or without a functional initiator there for such as the polyols described hereinbefore and in the patents mentioned above, and a suitable catalyst, the choice of which will depend on the presence or absence of added initiator. Suitable cyclic ester monomers which can be employed in the manufacture of the cyclic ester polymers are best illustrated by the following formula EMI21.1 wherein the R1, A, x, c, and b variables have the significance noted in Unit I supra.Representative cyclic ester monomers which are contemplated include, for example deltavalerolactone epsilon caprolactone, zeta enantholactone the monoalkyldelta valerolactones, e.g., the monomethyl , monoethyl , monohexyl , delta valerolactones, and the like.In the absence of added functional initiator, the polymerization process is desirably effected undar the operative conditions and, as noted in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,021,309 to 3,021,317, in the presence of anionic catalysts. When reacting a mixture containing cyclic ester monomer and functional initiator which possesses at least one active hydrogen substituent, e.g., carboxyl or hydroxyl, it is desirable to use the catalysts noted in U.S. Pat. Nos.2,878,236, 2,890,208, 3,169,945 and 3,284,417 under the operative conditions discussed therein. Suitable polyol initiators and polycarboxylic acid initiators are those listed in U.S. Pat. 3,169,945 and others of the patents enumerated herein as well as those polyols and polycarboxylic compounds listed hereinbefore. Polymers of cyclic esters can also be manufactured via the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,962,524. Cyclic ester alkylene oxide copolymers can also be prepared by reacting a mixture comprising cyclic ester and alkylene oxide monomers, an interfacial agent such as a solid, relatively high molecular weight poly vinylstearate or lauryl methacrylate vinyl chloride copolymer reduced viscosity in cyclohexanone at 300 C. of from about 0.3 to about 1.0 , in the presence of an inert, normally liquid, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon vehicle such as heptane and phosphorus pentafluoride as the catalyst therefor, at an elevated tempature, e.g., about 80 C., and for a period of time sufficient to produce such cyclic esters alkylene oxide copolymers. When the cyclic ester polymers are prepared from a mixture containing the cyclic ester monomer and minor amounts of cyclic comonomer which is copolymerizable therewith, e.g., cyclic carbonates and cyclic ethers such as alkylene oxide, oxetane, tetrahydrofuran, etc. the polymeric chain of the resulting copolymeric product will be characterized by both recurring linear Unit I, supra,as well as the recurring linear Unit II which would represent the alkylene oxide comonomer polymerized therein and or by a recurring linear unit which would correspond to the additional polymerizable cyclic comonomer in the monomeric mixture. When the comonomer is an alkylene oxide, the resulting copolymeric product will contain both recurring linear Unit I and recurring linear Unit II in the copolymeric chain thereof.The interconnection of linear Unit I and linear Unit II supra does not involve or result in the direct bonding of two oxy groups, i.e., 00. In other words, the oxy group O of recurring linear Unit II is interconnected with the carbonyl groupEMI23.1 of recurring linear Unit I supra or with the alkylene moiety of a second oxyalkylene Unit it3. Polymers of cyclic esters as described above are useful in producing polyurethane articles having comparatively high strength and elongation. As mentioned previously, the polymers of cyclic esters which are contemplated are expressed in terms of their reduced viscosity values. As is well known in the art, reduced viscosity value is a measure or indication of the molecular weight of polymers. The expression reduced viscosity is a value obtained by dividing the specific viscosity by the concentration of polymer in the solution, the concentration being measured in grams of polymer per 100 milliliters of solvent. The specific viscosity is obtained by dividing the difference between the viscosity of the solution and the viscosity of the solvent by the viscosity of the solvent.Unless otherwise noted, the reduced viscosity values herein referred to are measured at a concentration of 0.2 grams of polymer in 100 milliliters of solvent e.g., cyclohexanone, benzene, chloroform, toluene, or other common organic solvents at 30 C. Another type of active hydrogen containing materials useful in this invention are the polymer polyol compositions obtained by pol1merizing ethylenically unsaturated monomers in a polyol as described in British Pat.No. 1,063,222 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,383,351, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The polymer polyol compositions can contain from about 1 to about 70 weight percent, preferably about 5 to about 50 weight percent, and most preferably about 10 to about 40 weight percent monomer polymerized in the polyol.Such compositions are conveniently prepared by polymerizing the monomers in the selected polyol at a temperature of 40 C. to 1500 C. in the presence of a free radical polymerization catalyst such as peroxides, persulfates, percarbonates,perborates and azo compounds.Further details of the compositions and methods of making same are described in the above mentioned British patent and U.S. patent. The resulting composition is believed to be a complex mixture comprising free polyol, free polymer and graft polymer polyol complexes. Preparation 1 of the British patent is especially preferred.

The thixotrope is used in amounts of from about 1 to about 15, and preferably, from about 2 to about 10, parts per 100 parts of polyol s by weight. When a catalyst is used in the composition a wide variety of urethane forming catalysts can be used.Preferably, the catalyst has the following characteristics a high activity for the reaction of isocyanate and organic hydroxyl groups low activity for the reaction of isocyanate and water high solubility in polyols the ability to delay the viscosity increase in bulk after the catalyst is mixed into the froth its catalytic effect being delayed for a brief time period in the temperature range of about 5 to about 400C delay time of about 30 seconds to about 120 seconds is preferable high solubility in the diluent. These catalysts include dialkyl tin carboxylates, such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, dioleate, diacetate, or di 2 ethylhexoate, and the like dimethyl tin diths.laurate, stannous octoate, stannous oleate, po tassium octoate, potassium acetate, phenyl mercuric propionate, iron 111 acetyl acetonate, copper Il acetyl acetonate, zinc octoate, zinc acetate, cobalt 11 acetate, manganese II acetate, isopropyl titanate, triacryl isopropyl titanate, lead naphthanate, cobalt naphthanate, bismuth nitrate, ferric III chloride, sodium silicate, aluminum acetyl acetonate, zinc acetyl acetonate, nickel II acetyl acetonate, methyl titanate and zinc stearate. Particularly effective catalysts are those with tin sulfur bonds and include, for example, dibutyl tin sulfide, and the like, and dialkyl tin dithiodialkylidene diesters of the following formula EMI30.1 Wherein R2 and R3 are independently alkyl, arylalkyl, and alkylaryl containing 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, and d is an integer of 1 to 8 and d is an integer of from 1 to 10. Preferably, R2 and R3 is alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms and d is an integer of 1 to 4. Also, tertiary amines may be used as the catalyst. These tertiary amines can be illustrated by the following formula EMI30.2 wherein R6, R7, and R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl radicals wherein the aryl, alkylaryl and arylalkyl radicals contain from about 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, the alkyl radicals contain from 6 to 18 carbon atoms, the alkenyl radicals contain from about 3 to 18 carbon atoms, and saturated 5 and 6 membered heterocyclic radicals containing from one to three nitrogen atoms, a is an integer of from 1 to 5.EMI31.1 Wherein R9, R10 and R11 are independently sel ected from N R12 or monofunctional optionally substi R 13 tuted hvdrocarbon radicals with the Proviso that at least one of Rg, R10 or R1l is aEMI31.2 radical wherein R9 and R10 are selected from C1 to C6 alkyl,C2 to C6 hydroxyalkyl and e is 0 to 10. As examples of optionally substituted hydrocarbon radicals there may be mentioned morpholinoalkyl piperidinoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl hydroxyalkyl alkoxyalkyl and alkylcarbonyloxyalky. These triazine containing compounds are known in the art as shown for example in U.S. Patent 3,884,917. The amines suitable for use herein include triethylene diamine, N,N dimethylcyclohexylamine, triethylamine, N ethylmorpholine, N methyl 2,2 dialkyl l,3 oxazolidines, N alkylpiperadines, N,N dia kypiperazines, tetramethyl l,3 butane diamine, dimethylethanol amine, bis dimethylamino diethyl ether, imidazole, N,N ,N tris 3 dimethylaminopropyl S hexahydrotriazine. Also, mixtures of the above catalysts can be used. The catalyst is used in amounts of as little as 0.01 parts by weight, to about 0.50 parts by weight, based on theweight of the polyol s . The amount of catalyst used depends upon the froth temperature into which the catalyst is injected, the amount and alkalinity of any fillers present, the reactivity of the polyol s and the temperature of the substrate to which it is being applied.For example, a catalyst such as a dialkyl tin dithioalkylidene diester is used only in amounts of about 0.1 part when the froth temperature is about 40 C, and the substrate temperature of a wall panel, for example is about 25 C. When the froth temperature is lower than about 400C, and the substrate temperature is lower than about 250C, then more than 0.1 part and as much as 0.50 parts by weight of the catalyst per 100 parts of polyol s can be used. The catalyst is generally added in a solvent.This solvent may be selected from a wide variety of materials. The solvent may be a polyol, or a polyamine, for example, those described, supra, or a surfactant as described infra, or a plasticizer such as a dialkyl phthalate.Generally, the catalyst is dissolved in from about 10 to about 100 parts of solvent per part of catalyst. The catalyst can be mixed with the solvent and this mixture added to the froth foam and mixed with the froth foam. When the catalyst s added in this manner it is dissolved in solvent. This represents the preferred method of adding the catalyst. Alternatively, relatively large amounts of catalysts which are insoluble in polyols, such as tisnuth and silicate containing catalysts, specifically Bi N03 3 and Na2SiO3, can be mixed with said polyol s and solubilized by the subsequent addition of simple glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerin, or mixtures thereof. Since the catalyst is not soluble in the polyol no gelation occurs in the hose dispensing the froth.If the catalyst were soluble in the polyol, and it was added to the polyol package, in said large amounts, gelation would in fact occur in the dispensing means and plug it. The composition of this invention may optionally contain one or more of the following ingredients surfactant, water scavenger, filler, flare retardant, dyes, pigments, and the like. The surfactant is preferably an organosilicon copolymer as described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,772,224 and 4,022,722. Another organosilicon surfactant is a partially cross linked siloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymer and mixtures thereof, wherein the siloxane blocks and polyoxyalkylene blocks are linked by silicon to carbon, or by silicon to oxygen to carbon, linkages. The siloxane blocks are comprised of hydrocarbon siloxane groups and have an average of at least two valences of silicon per block combined in said linkages. At least a portion of the polyoxyalkylene blocks are comprised of oxyalkylene groups and are polyvalent, i.e., have at leasttwovalances of carbon and or carbon bonded oxygen per block combined in said linkages. Any remaining polyoxyalkylene blocks are comprised of oxyalkylene groups and are monovalent, i.e., have only one valence of carbon or carbon bonded oxygen per block combined in said linkages. Additionally, conventional organo polysiloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymers such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,834,748, 2,846,458, 2,868,824, 2,917,480 and 3,957,901 can be employed. A further surfactant which can be used herein is a high molecular weight linear non hydrolyzable AB n siloxane polyoxyalkylene block copolymer as described inU.S. Patent 4,022,722, which is incorporated herein by reference. These block copolymers as described in U.S.Patent 4,022,722 have the following average formula EMI34.1 wherein R14 and R114 independently represent a monovalent hydrocarbon radical free from aliphatic unsaturation, n is an integer of from 2 to 4 inclusive c is an integer of at least 6 f is an integer of at least 4 g is an integer of at least 4 B represents a divalent organic group attached to the adjacent silicon atom by a carbon to silicon bond and to the polyoxyalkylene block by an oxygen atom,with the proviso that one Y group is present in the formula the average molecular weight of each siloxane block being from about 500 to about 10,000 the average molecular weightof each polyoxyalkylene block being from about 300 to about 10,000 said siloxane blocks constituting from about 20 to about 50 weight percent of the copolymer the polyoxyalkylene blocks constituting about 80 to about 50 weight percent of the copolymer and the block copolymer having an average molecular weight of at least about 30,000. The surfactant can be used in amounts of from l.to about 10, and preferably, from about 1 to about 4 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol s . The moisture absorbing materials which can be used in this invention include molecular sieves of the zeolite type, silicates, such as ethyl silicates, oxazolidines, carbodiimides, inorganic materials such as magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride and any other inorganic salts capable of hydrating with water. Molecular sieves are preferred. The moisture absorbing material can be used in amounts of from about 1 to about 15, and preferably, from about 3 to about 7 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol s . Suitable fillers which can be used include, for example, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, alumina trihydrate, and the like. Preferably, the filler has low adsorbed moisture. The filler may have a catalytic effect in this invention. The fillers can be used in amounts up to about 250, and preferably from about 100 to about 200 parts by weight per 100 parts of polyol s . When it is desired to prepare cured polyurethane foams having fire retardant properties, fire retardant compounds may be added to the composition. Suitable fire retardant compounds include alumina trihydrate, phosphorus containing compounds including, for example, tricresyl phosphate and the like, halogenated phosphates including, for example, tris dichloropropyl phosph.ate. In the practice of this invention the uncured froth has a density of from about 18 to about 45 lbs. ft.3.The density of the froth is approximately equal to the density of the cellular polyurethane formed. The ingredients of the composition are so chosen so that the amount of moisture in the composition is less than that amount which would cause the composition to cure to a cellular polyurethane having a density which is not essentially the same density as that of the frothed composition. The composition of this invention forms a cellular polyurethane wherein there is essentially no postb low. The amount of moisture in the composition can be controlled to be as low as possible by having the ingredients introduce an insignificant amount of moisture into the composition. This is accomplished by, for example, choosing a polyol with an average hydroxyl number as low as possible a low hygroscopicity and choosing an isocyanate which is capable of curing with the polyol inas short a time period as possible. A urethane forming catalyst may be added to affect a faster curing rate. If a polyol is chosen which has a high hydroxyl number or a high hygroscopicity, then a moisture absorbing material may be added to the composition. Thus, it can be seen that by correlating the various ingredients, a composition containing a minimum amount of moisture can be achieved. EXAMPLES The following examples serve to give specific illustrations of the practice of this invention but they are not intended in any way to limit the scope of this invention. In the following Examples, the froth was produced by using the apparatus described in Figures 1 and 2. EXAMPLE 1 A polyol package was prepared by mixing in a closed gallon container under a blanket of nitrogen, 57.7 pounds of castor oil, 14.4 pounds of a propylene oxide adduct of an 80 20 mixture of sorbitol and propylene glycol, which polyol has a hydroxyl number of 490, 4.3 pounds of a thixotrope, i.e., hydrogenated castor oil, 0.7 pounds of a surfactant which is of the formula AB n wherein A is a block of dimethylsilicone units, B is a block of oxyalkylene units and n is greater than 20 hereinafter referred to as surfactant A , and 3.6 pounds of 3A molecular sieves, 72.1 pounds of aluntna trihydrate and 72.2 pounds of 2,2 dickloro 1,3 propanediyl tetrakis 2 chloroethyl phosphate flame retardant.The ingredients were mixed until the temperature reached 600C at which ppint they were allowed to cool under nitrogen. The material was then fed to the SKG continuous mixer along with nitrogen under pressure about 30 70 psi back pressure . The nitrogen was fed into the polyol pipe just prior to the stream entering the continuous mixer. A stoichiometric amount of liquid polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate was also pumped into the continuous mixer by means of the Lenith metering pump through another pipe. The resulting froth was pumped through an 8 foot long by 1 2 inch internal diameter hose to a motionless mixer Stata Tube 20 65, 3 4 inch nominal diameter, 22 1 2 inch long .Immediately prior to the motionless mixer 5 weight percent of a catalyst which is a lalkl dimercaptide carboxylic acid ester of the formulaEMI38.1 wherein R2 and R3 are CH3, n equals 2 and m is an integer of from 1 to 10. UL 24 sold by Witco Chemical Company in a polyol comprising a propylene oxide adduct of glycerine with a hydroxyl number of 240 was injected by neans of a micro metering pump at a rate to provide 0.1 parts of catalyst per 100 parts by weight of polyol. The catalyst was dispersed in the froth by passing through the motionless mixer. The catalyzed froth was deposited onto a wall board joint and spread over the joint with a steel blade to form a smooth seam. The froth density was 32 lbs. ft.3.The seamed joint was cured vertically at 260C, and 90 relative humidity. No sagging or postfoaming of the seam occurred. It reached a gelled stage within 33 minutes and within 45 minutes a blade could be drawn over the surface without marring it. Example 2 The procedure of Example l was repeated except that the polyol package was made up of the following ingredients 5400 grams of a polyol comprising a propylene oxide adduct of glycerine with a hydroxyl number of 30 capped with ethylene oxide to give a hydroxyl number of 27 600 grams of ethylene glycol 300 grams of hydrogenated castor oil 300 grams of 3A molecular sieves and 60 grams of the surfactant of Example 1. The froth was produced by the procedure described in Example 1. The froth was deposited onto a wall board joint and spread over the joint with a steel blade to form a smooth seam. The froth density was 32 lbs. ft.3. The seamed joint was cured vertically at 260C and 90 relative humidity. No sagging or postfoaming of the seam occurred.The froth reached a gelled stage within 28 minutes and within 50 minutes a blade could be drawn over the surface without marring it.
