# CROSSLINKED FLOW CONTROL ADDITIVES FOR HIGH SOLIDS PAINTS

## Abstract
Crosslinked, preferably acrylic, preferably melmine crosslinked, polymer particles formed by reactions compris ing free radical addition polymerization of a between about 0.5 and about 20 weight percent each of first and second monomers, each bearing functionality capable of crosslinking reaction with the other, wherein i either both additionally are ethylenically unsaturated mono mers or ii the first monomer additionally is ethylenically unsaturated and the second monomer bears multiple cross linking functionality and no ethylenic unsaturation and b between about 60 and about 99 weight percent of at least one other monoethylenically unsaturated monomer in the presence of I an organic liquid which is a solvent for the polymerizable monomers, but a non solvent for the resul tant polymer, and II polymeric dispersion stabilizer bearing, on the average, more than one long chain non polar hydro carbon molecules and at least one pendant vinyl un saturation.
