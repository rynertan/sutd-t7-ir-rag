# Photoelectrochemical cell.

## Abstract
Solid liquid interface photoelectrochemical cells are provided wherein the liquid phase comprises a nonaqueous solvent, an electrolyte dissolved therein forming an ionically conductive solution and a redox couple suitable to accept and donate electrons from and to the electrodes. The redox couple is present in an amount sufficient to sustain a predetermined current and the concentrations of the electro lyte and redox couple in the solution are sufficient to provide no greater than a selected smal voltage drop relative to the output voltage of the cell. The efficiency of conversion of light to electrical energy of such photoelectrochemical cells are 10 and greater.
