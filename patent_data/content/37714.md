## Description
DESCRIPTION HIGH PRESSURE DIE ASSEMBLY THIS invention relates to a high pressure die assembly.High pressure die assemblies form a part of apparatus which is used for generating ultra high pressures and temperatures. It is necessary to generate ultra high pressures and temperatures when manufacturing synthetic diamonds, cubic boron nitride or abrasive compacts containing these abrasives.Such assemblies consist generally of a die member which is circular in plan and has an aperture extending therethrough and a pair of opposed anvils or pistons adapted to move in and out of the aperture. Defined within the aperture when the anvil or pistons are therein is a reaction chamber.The aperture may be a double tapered aperture, with the leading ends of the anvil shaped to fit into the ends thereof. Die assemblies containing an aperture and anvils so shaped are used extensively for the manufacture of synthetic diamonds, cubic boron nitride and abrasive compacts containing these abrasives. An example of this apparatus is described in US patent specification No. 2,941,248.The aperture can also take the form of a cylinder in which event the anvils will act as pistons moving in the cylinder. Apparatus of this nature is described, for example, in US patent specification No. 4,197,066.The anvils and die members for high pressure die assemblies are generally made of a hard material such as cemented carbide, particularly cemented tungsten carbide.According to the present invention, there is provided a high pressure die assembly including a die member having an aperture formed therethrough and a pair of opposed anvils adapted to move into and out of the aperture, a reaction chamber being defined in the aperture when the anvils are therein, characterised in that the die member includes a body of abrasive compact and the aperture is formed through this body. Thus, the reaction chamber is provided with surrounding walls which are made of abrasive compact, a material of very high compressive strength.Any abrasive compact well known in the art may be used for the body.Abrasive compacts consist essentially of a mass of abrasive particles, generally present in an amount of at least 70 , preferably 80 to 90 , by volume of the compact, bonded into a hard conglomerate. Compacts are polycrystalline masses and can replace single large crystals. The abrasive particles of compacts are super hard abrasives such as diamond and cubic boron nitride.Abrasive compacts, particularly diamond and cubic boron nitride compacts, may be self bonded i.e. the individual particles of the compact may be fused and bonded together without the aid of a metal or like bonding matrix. Alternatively, stronger and more durable compacts are produced when there is a suitable bonding matrix present.In the case of cubic boron nitride compacts, i.e. compacts in which the abrasive particle is predominantly cubic boron nitride, the bonding matrix, when provided, preferably contains a catalyst also known as a solvent for cubic boron nitride growth. Examples of suitable catalysts are aluminium or an alloy of aluminium with nickel, cobalt, iron,manganese or chromium.In the case of diamond compacts, i.e. compacts in which the abrasive particle is predominantly diamond, the bonding matrix, when provided, preferably contains a solvent for diamond growth. Suitable solvents are metals of Group VIII of the Periodic Table such as cobalt, nickel or iron or an alloy containing such a metal.For diamond and cubic boron nitride compacts the presence of a solvent or catalyst for the particular abrasive being used in the compact is desirable because then under the conditions necessary for the manufacture of such compacts intergrowth between the particles occurs. As is known in the art, diamond and cubic boron nitride compacts are generally manufactured under conditions of temperature and pressure at which the abrasive particle is crystallographically stable.It is essential to the die assembly of the invention that abrasive compact provides the walls for the reaction chamber. This may be achieved by making the die member of abrasive compact entirely. The abrasive compact may be made using conventional techniques and the aperture then formed through it using conventional cutting methods such as laser cutting, drilling or spark erosion.Alternatively, the die member may consist of a core of abrasive compact surrounded by a support ring of cemented carbide. Such die members may be formed from wire drawing die blanks of the type consisting of abrasive compact surrounded by and bonded to a cemented carbide support ring. Such wire drawing die blanks are described and illustrated in the prior art, for example US patent specificationNo. 3,831,428 and European patent publication No.O 001 184. Again, the aperture may be formed in the compact core using any conventional and known cutting technique such as laser cutting, ultra sonic drilling or spark erosion.The anvils may be made of cemented carbide or other such material.Alternatively, and this is preferred, the leading ends of the anvils consist of abrasive compact. This arrangement has been found to be of particular value when the anvil takes the form of a piston which moves in and out of a cylindrical aperture.The die assembly may be used as such for generating ultra high pressures in the reaction chamber. Such ultra high pressures are generated by employing the die assembly in conventional high pressure high temperature apparatus of the type illustrated in the abovementioned US specifications.Alternatively, the assembly may be used as a pressure intensification unit as a second stage by placing it in the reaction chamber of a conventional high pressure high temperature apparatus of the type described above.Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which all three figures illustrate schematically high pressure die assemblies of the invention.Referring first to Figure 1, there is shown a high pressure die assembly having die member 10 which is circular in plan. This die member consists of a core of abrasive compact 12 surrounded by and bonded to a cemented carbide supporting ring 14. A double tapered hole 16 is formed in the abrasive compact core using, for example, laser cutting. The die may be made from a wire drawing die blank of the type described and illustrated in the abovementioned publications. The assembly also includes a pair of opposed anvils 18. The leading ends 20 of the anvils are adapted to move in and out of the aperture 16.When the leading ends 20 are located in the aperture 16 a reaction chamber 21 is defined therein. The anvils are shaped from wire drawing die blanks consisting of an abrasive compact 22 surrounded by a cemented carbide ring 24. Shaping of the wire drawing die blank into the required shape may be achieved using the same cutting techniques which are used for forming the aperture 16. The die assembly illustrated by Figure 2. is the same as that forFigure 1 except that the anvils and die member are both made of abrasive compact which is not surrounded by cemented carbide. Like parts carry like numerals. This arrangement has particular application to assemblies wherein the compact is a cubic boron nitride compact. In the die assemblies of both Figure 1 and Figure 2 suitable gasket or sealing means will in use be provided between the contacting faces of the anvils and the die members. The gasket or sealing means will typically be pyrophyllite.A piston cylinder die assembly is illustrated by Figure 3. This assembly consists of a die member 26 circular in plan and having a cylindrical aperture 28. Opposed pistons 30 move in and out of aperture 28. The pistons 30 and die member 26 are made of cubic boron nitride compact.
