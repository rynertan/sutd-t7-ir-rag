# Electrophotographic reproducing machine.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic reproducing machine wherein an integrally formed dish like housing B for an exposure optical system is mounted onto a machine frame A which accommodates therein a plurality of process units for repro ducing and is opened upward, and a document glass plate D is mounted at the top portion of the housing B for the exposure optical system through glass mounting plates 57A, 57B . The housing B accomodates therein a slit plate 31 for scanning of an exposure lamp 29 , a projection lens 24 , which is formed in its peripheral walls with vent holes 19 for promoting ventilation within the machine and which has at its bottom portion a shield bottom wall 16 serving as also a heat insulating plate. Guide rail surfaces 33A, 33B for guiding movable mounts 32 of the optical system are formed on both side walls 18A, 18B of the housing B op posite to each other. A projection lens mounting seat 23 is integrally formed substantially at the center of the bottom wall 16 of the housing B , and a shield box 26 raised up ward from the bottom wall 16 is integrally formed on the bottom wall 16 at a position adjacent to the projection lens mounting seat 23 .
