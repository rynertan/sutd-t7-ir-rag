# POSITIONING DEVICE FOR RESISTOR HEATING ELEMENTS

## Abstract
A positioning device for resistor heating elements, parti cularly for clothes washing machines, characterized essential ly in that the element is fitted at its head end using an annular shaped flexible component surrounding the said head and inserted in turn into an orifice provided in the side walls of the tub, ensuring the water tightness and determining the flexible positioning of the element in its equilibrium position relative to the supporting zone while the positioning of the element and the contact of its extremity with the bottom of the tub is ensured by the exterior application of a tractive force to the free extremity forming the connection head by means of a helicoidal spring in permanent tension.
