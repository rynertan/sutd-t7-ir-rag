# Improved single filer blow back apparatus.

## Abstract
An air signle filer apparatus for cylindrical articles 10 is described. A pair of sidewalls 17,18 are defining a bulk stor age zone 14 and an adjacent layout zone 16 . A plenum 36 is connected to a source of pressure air, and is attachend to each sidewall. Air jet openings 38 in each of said sidewalls serves to advance the articles in single file from the bottom of the bulk storage zone 14 to the outlet 24 . A horizontal slot 42 in a vertical wall 34 above the outlet only extends adjacent a top wall of the layout zone and communicates with the plenum 36 for blowing air only along the undersurface of said top wall whereby to draft articles toward the top wall which are not aligned in the layout path and then blow them upstream in said layout zone above the aligned row of articles towards the bulk storage zone.
