# IMPROVEMENTS IN ELECTRICAL SWITCHES

## Abstract
An electrical switch for protecting equipment from oerheating has a bimetallic element 16 which breaks electrical contact at a threshold temperature and a resetting member 40 which restores it when depressed manually. A bistable, over centre contact member 24 is arranged such that initial movement of the resetting member moves the contact member over centre, but also displaces the contact member, leaving the electrical contacts disengaged. Electric al contact is only restored on release of the resetting member. In this way the risks of manual tampering with the switch are reduced.
