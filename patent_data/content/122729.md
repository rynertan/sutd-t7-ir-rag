# Copy machine with document dependent control.

## Abstract
A copy machine 1 having an eddy current proximity detector 15 positioned so relative movement is provided between the detector and a document to be copied. The detec tor is connected to control logic circuitry 40 for the copy machine so that the copy machine is prevented from produc ing a copy when the detector detects metal carried by the document. A document cover position indicating device 4 is also connected to the control logic 40 for the copy machine so that closure of the document cover 3 is required for the production of a copy.
