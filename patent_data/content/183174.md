As the phenoxyamines of the formulaII, there may be employed those having aryl moieties listed above with respect to the compounds of the formulaI. Further, R1 and R2 of the formula III may be those listed above with respect to the compounds of the formulaI. As the base to be used in the reaction, there may be mentioned a pyridine base such as pyridine, picoline, lutidine or collidine a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5,4,0 undecene 7 or N,Ndimethylaniline or an inorganic base such as NaRCO3, KHCQ3, Na2C03 or K2CO3. Among them, pyridine is preferred. The base is used in an amount of from 0.5 to 20, preferably from 1 to 10 in the molar ratio relative to the carbamic acid chloride of the formula III. No solvent may be used for the reaction, However, it is possible to employ a solvent inert to the reaction, for instance, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene or xylene a halogenated hydrocarbon.such as chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene tetrahydrofuran ethyl acetate or dimethylformamide. For the reaction, the carbamic acid chloride is used usually in an amount of from 0.8 to 3 mols, preferably from 1 to 2 mols, per mol of the phenoxyamine. The two reactants and the base are mixed without a solvent or in the above mentioned solvent, and then stirred at a temperature of from 0 to 100 0C, preferably from 0 to 60 0C for from 0.5 to 30 hours. After the reaction, the desired product can be obtained in a conventional method as shown in theExamples given hereinafter.Process 2 Among the substituted phenoxy ureas of the present invention, those wherein R2 is a hydrogen atom, i.e.those represented by the formula I II, can be produced by reacting a phenoxyamine of the formula II with an isocyanate of the formula IV. In this case, as specific compounds of the phenoxyamine of the formula II, those used for Process 1, may be mentioned. Further, the specific examples of the alkyl group, etc. for R1 of the formula IV may be the same. For the reaction, in addition to a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, a Lewis acid such as AlCl3 or ZnC12 may be used in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 mol relative to the phenoxyamine of the formala II in a reaction solvent listed in Process 1, and the desired compound can be obtained in the same manner as in Process 1 except that an isocyanate of the formula IV is used in an amount of from 0.8 to 2 in a molar ratio relative to the phenoxyamine of the formula II.Process 3 The substituted phenoxy ureas of the formula I II of the present invention can be produced also by reacting a phenoxyzarbamate of the formula V with an amine of the formula VI. As the aryl moiety of the formula EMI33.1 of the compound of the formula V, there may be mentioned those listed above as the aryl moiety in the formula I, and as Ar, there may be mentioned a phenyl group, a chlorophenyl group or a tolyl group. Further, the phenoxy carbamate of the formula V can be produced from a phenoxyamine of the formula II and ArOCOCl by using a base and solvent as mentioned in Process 1. As the alkyl group, etc. for R1 of the amine of the formula VI, those listed above with respect to the formula I may be mentioned. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature of from 0 to 1000C, preferably from 0 to 800C for 0.5 to 5 hours by using from 0.8 to 5 mols of the amine of the formula VI relative to one mol of the phenoxy carbamate of the formula V. In this case, the same solvents as mentioned as in Process 1 may be used. Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted to these specific Examples.EXAMPLE 1 3 2,5 Dichlorophenoxy l,l dmethyl urea Compound No. 1 5.00 g 28.1 mmol of 2,5 dichlorophenoxyamine was dissolved in 6.8 ml of pyridine, and then 3.02 g 28.1 mmol of dimethylcarbamoyl chloride was added.

The compound of the formula I may be used by itself as a herbicide. However, better results can be obtained if it is used in the form of appropriate formulations such as granules, wettable powder, emulsifiable concentrates, dusts or fine granules. The herbicides of such various formulations may be prepared by combining the compound of the formula I appropriately with a solid carrier such as talc, bentonite, clay, calcite, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, white carbon, vermiculite, lime, siliceous sand, ammonium sulfate or urea, or a liquid carrier such as xylene, kerosine, ethylene glycol, ethyl cellosolve, methyl ethyl ketone, alcohols, dioxane, acetone, cyciohexanone, methyl naphtalene or dimethylformamide, and an emulsifier or dispersing agent such as an alkyl sulfate, an alkyl aryl sulfonate, a polyoxyethylene glycol ether, a polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ether or a polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoalky late, and other adjuvants such as carboxymethyl cellulose or gum arabic. The amount of the active ingredient is us ally from 0.5 to 20 by weight in the case of granules, and from 5 to 70 by weight in the case of an emulsifiable concentrate or wettable powder, although it may be varied as the case requires. The herbicide of the present invention may be applied as it is, or after being diluted with or suspended in e.g. water, in an amount effective to provide herbicidal activities. The dose of the active ingredient of the compound of the present invention varies depending upon the soil condition, the formulation, the season of the application and the method of application and the types of crop plants and the types of weeds. It is usually in a range of 10 g to 5 kg per 1 hectare. Other herbicides or fertilizers can be incorporated in the herbicidal composition of the present invention, if necessary. Now, specific formulations will be given in the following Formulation Examples However, it should be understood that the types of the additives and the proportions of various ingredients are not restricted to these specific Examples and may optionally be modified in a wide range.

They were grown in a greenhouse, and twenty days after the application, the herbicidal effects and phytotoxicity were evaluated in accordance with the standards as identified in Table 5.

filled, then seeds of barnyardgrass, crabgrass, redroot pigweed and rice flatsedge were sown, and they were grown in a greenhouse until barnya rdgrass reached 3 leaf stage.Each wettable powder prepared from the test compound in accordance with Formulation Example 3 was diluted with water to give the amount of the active ingredient corresponding to 4 kg hectare, and the diluted solution was uniformly sprayed at an application rate of 1000 liter hectare from the top of plants by means of a small size spray, when barnyardgrass was in the 3 leaf stage.They were grown in a greenhouse, and twenty days after the application, the herbicidal effects were evaluated in accordance with the standards as identified in Table 5.The results thereby obtained are shown in Table 9.
