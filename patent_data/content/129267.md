# Method of manufacturing a domestic moulded on mains plug.

## Abstract
In a method of manufacturing a moulded on mains plug of the type having a base 3 , an insulating cap 1 covering the wire connection points 9 , and a moulded on plug body, the presence and position of the cap 1 is detected by probe pins 37, 39 of a pressure member 31 coupled to a position detec tor 47 . The arrangement is such that the moulding material can only be injected into the moulding die 27, 29 if the cap 1 is substantially in its correct position. In this way, it is not possible to produce a moulded on mains plug having no insulating cap or in which the cap is provided but is incorrectly positioned.
