# LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY SYSTEM HAVING IMPROVED TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display system having improved temper ature compensation based upon electrical measurement of liquid crystal display segment capacitance. The capacitance of a segment is measured when preconditioned to a first voltage below the threshold voltage and when precon ditioned to a second voltage above the threshold voltage. Separate embodiments are disclosed which sequentially measure the capacitance of a single segment or which simultaneously measures the capacitance of two segments. The magnitude of the second voltage is adjusted to converge the ratio of the measured capacitances to a predetermined fixed value or a predetermined value selected according to the display temperature. A preferred embodiment is a display system 16 which accepts digit data for storage in a digit shift register 22 or segment data for storage in a segment shift register 24 . In accordance with mode signals received by a format control 20 , a sequence control 26 cooperates with a ROM 28 to convert digit data to segment data. A temperature compensator 36 cooperates with a voltage regulator 32 to generate the required drive voltages for the display as fixed percentages of the second voltage.
