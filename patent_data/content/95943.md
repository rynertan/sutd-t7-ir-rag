# Method and apparatus for making reinforced cement board.

## Abstract
A network of reinforcing fibers 14 is pressed against the surface of an underlying carrier sheet 13 by the weight of a concrete mix. A vertical gap between the sheet and the net work is created so that the concrete mix may penetrate the voids of the network and spread out on the underlying sheet to embed the fibers.
