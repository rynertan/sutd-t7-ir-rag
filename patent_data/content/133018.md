# Deagglomeration of porous siliceous crystalline materials.

## Abstract
The tendency of siliceous zeolite crystals to agglomerate can be reduced by treating the crystals with an aqueous medium which is maintained at a pH of from 11.5 to 13 and or at a temperature which is from 50F DEG to 100F DEG 10C DEG and 38C DEG higher than the forming mixture from which the zeolite crystals have been formed.
