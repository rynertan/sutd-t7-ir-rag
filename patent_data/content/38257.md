# Oxygen aspirator burner and process for firing a furnace with an oxygen enriched oxidant gas.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with an oxygen aspirator burner 1 and a process for firing a furnace with an oxygen enriched oxidant gas. The process and apparatus for firing a furnace using oxygen or oxygen enriched air as the oxidant gas, comprises injection into the furnace of a plurality of oxidant jets 8 , through nozzles 4 , in a spaced relationship to a fuel jet 9 , at a velocity sufficient to cause aspiration of furnace gases into the oxidant jets before the latter mix with the fuel jet, in amounts sufficient to lower flame tempera ture.
