# A circuit and a method for processing amplitude and phase variable multiphase signals which are required as current or voltage reference to drive synchronous motors.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a circuit and to a method for processing amplitude and phase variable multiphase sig nals, which are required as current or voltage reference to drive electric motors, comprising a synchro resolver angular position trasducer 11 , rigidly connected with a synchronous motor 10 with the same polar configuration and number of poles thereof, according to which the analog signals de tected by said transducer 11 are modulated, demodulated and outputted out of phase by 90 with the signals relating to the roating magnetic field. The circuit moreover comprises a phase shifter device 14 and means 15 for modifying the amplitude of signals out putted by said transducer 11 as a function of at least one control signal. The resultant of the signals processed by said means 14, 15 is supplied to an amplifier 19 to generate in the stator currents of determined amplitude and phases for driving said motor 10 complying with the magnetic laws thereof.
