# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TOOL HOLDERS

## Abstract
This invention relates to tool holders suitable for mount ing a tap in the spindle of a rotating machine. To allow for axial movement between the tap and the tool holder, the tool holder includes a driving element 10 having a cylindrical sleeve 11 fitted therein. A ball cage 13 is slideable within the sleeve 11 and a tool holding unit 15 is slideable within the ball cage. Torsional drive forces are transmitted from the element 10 to the unit 15 by means of two hard steel rollers 18 and 19 . The roller 19 is in contact with the shoulder 20 on the sleeve 11 and with a shoulder 21 on the unit 15 . Similarly, the roller 18 is in contact with a shoulder 22 on the sleeve 11 and a shoulder 23 on the unit 15 .
