## Description
This invention relates to biologically active polypeptides and their production from natural or synthetic sources, oligopeptides derived from said polypeptides, and compositions and methods for usefully applying the biological activity associated with the polypeptides and oligopeptides derived therefrom in the health sciences field. More particularly, this invention is directed to a general polypeptide structure which defines proteins having cell growth promoting activity and a novel class of transforming growth factor TGF polypeptides which have the property of reversibly conferring the transformed phenotype on normal cells in vitro and thus appear to be proximate effectors of the malignant phenotype. In another particular aspect, this invention is directed to antigenic oligopeptides derived from the TGF polypeptides and to antibodies raised to the antigenic oligopeptides and the associated TGF polypeptides which are useful in the detection and treatment of malignancies. In a further particular aspect, this invention is directed to a class of oligopeptides which have the ability to bind to cellular growth factor receptors and thus to potentially interfere with transformation of certain cell lines into a cancerous state. In a still further particular aspect, this invention is directed to a process for isolating TGF polypeptides in homogeneous form from both transformed human and murine cell lines and body fluids and to the homogeneous TGF polypeptides so obtained. Other particular aspects of this invention are directed to compositions and methods for detection and treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases and for cell growth associated treatment, for example, wound healing and ulcer treatment. A number of polypeptide hormone and hormone like growth factors have been found in tissue fluids and their relationship in the control of normal cellular growth or mitosis has been established. These mitogenic polypeptide growth factors include insulin, insulin like growth factors, platelet derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor EGF . At least some of these known growth factors have an effect on the growth of transformed cells, however, on the basis of in vitro tests, it appears that transformed cells require less of these known growth factors for optimal growth and multiplication than do normal cells. In particular, it has been shown in experiments in cell culture, that the addition of exogenous growth factors such as insulin and EGF can cause normal cells to mimic certain changes in cellular properties that are analogous to transformation however, they are unable to produce all of the changes associated with the transformed phenotype, e.g., see Sporn et al., 1981 Recently, new types of polypeptide growth factors designated as transforming growth factors or TGFs have been found in certain human and animal carcinoma and sarcoma cells which possess a greater complement of the properties apparently essential to phenotypic transformation Roberts et al. 1980 Thus, TGF polypeptides are a unique class of proteins distingishable from other growth factors such as EGF from the standpoint of both biological properties and chemical structure. These TGFs, in turn, possess a variety of properties of value or potential value in the health sciences field including potent but reversible cell growth or mitogenic properties which find use in cell repair including, for example, wound healing and ulcer therapy. Additionally, the production of TGF polypeptides, or elevated levels of production, are characteristic of, if not essential to, the morphologic transformation of certain cell lines in both human and murine tissue and or fluids therefore, the TGF polypeptides or antigenic fragments thereof are of value in differentiating normal cells from tumor cells and antibodies raised thereto have application in both the diagnosis and treatment of malignancies. Further, realization that certain TGF polypeptides specifically interact with and produce their biological effects through cellular membrane EGF receptors raises the possibility, once the basic TGF polypeptide structure is determined, of correlating the structure with the structure of EGF to develop oligopeptides having chemical characteristics to allow binding to the EGF receptors without concomitant phenotypic transformation of the cell. Oligopeptides having this characteristic EGF receptor binding ability find application in treatment of malignancies since the oligopeptide will interfere or compete with TGF for available receptor sites and thereby interrupt the expression of the transformed properties of the cell. With the present invention, a method has been developed to obtain TGF polypeptides in sufficient quantity and purity to allow complete structure determination and as a result of this determination and other observations, including the finding of substantial homology between human and murine TGFs, a basic peptide structure has been discovered which has broad application in cell mitosis and the cell growth related field of use. Further, homogeneous TGF polypeptides are obtained having application in both the cell growth field and in the detection and treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases. Additionally, antigenic oligopeptides and oligopeptides having the ability to bind to cellular growth factor receptors are derived from the basic peptide structure and the determined TGF polypeptide structures. Finally, compositions and methods, including antibodies raised to the TGF polypeptides and antigenic oligopeptides derived therefrom are provided for use in the health sciences field. Marquardt and Todaro, A basic protein structure has now been found which defines a new class of biologically active molecules. The finding of this framework polypeptide affording biological activity, particularly in the cell growth promotion area, is based on the discovery that a definite correlation exists between the three dimensional structure of certain polypeptides, including TGFs, containing multiple disulfide bonds and the biological activity attributable to the polypeptide. Accordingly, in one of its broadest aspects, the present invention is directed to biologically active polypeptides containing at least one peptide sequence of the formula I Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a specific class of polypeptides having transforming growth factor properties which include compounds of the formula II or oligomers thereof wherein R is Asp or Lys, R is Phe or Tyr, R is Ser or Phe, and R is Phe or Tyr. Also within the scope of the invention are antigenic oligopeptides derived from the polypeptides of formula II. An additional aspect of this invention relates to polypeptide growth factors containing one or more of the following peptide fragments A still further aspect of the present invention is directed to a class of oligopeptides which have an ability to bind cellular growth factor receptors, and therefore, have potential utility in treatment of malignancy. This class of oligopeptides is based on the discovery of key sequences in larger polypeptides molecules which exhibit both significant amino acid sequence homology in the appropriate three dimensional structure and have the ability to bind to cellular growth receptor sites. Accordingly, this aspect of the invention provides oligopeptides having the formula III Also contemplated by the invention are biologically active compositions and methods using the polypeptide and oligopeptide structures given above including antibodies to the polypeptides of formula II and the antigenic oligopeptides derived therefrom, said antibodies being optionally labeled with a label capable of providing a detectable signal for use in diagnostic methods or labeled with a cytotoxic agent for use in cancer or proliferative disease therapy. Other compositions and methods utilizing the cell growth promoting properties of the polypeptides of the present invention also form part of the present invention. A final aspect of the present invention includes a process for isolating homogeneous transforming growth factor polypeptides from less pure aqueous solutions containing said polypeptides, including body fluids and aqueous mediums conditioned with transforming growth factor producing cell lines, as well as the homogeneous transforming growth factor polypeptides produced thereby and antibodies raised to said homogeneous polypeptides. In its broadest aspects, the process of the invention involves isolation of a homegeneous transforming growth factor polypeptide from an aqueous medium containing said transforming growth factor polypeptide in impure form by the process steps comprising The peptide sequence which characterizes the basic protein structure according to the invention contains six cysteine residues positioned at critical positions in the polypeptide framework. It is speculated that the positioning of the cysteine residues allows the polypeptide to fold in a particular fashion as a result of disulfide bridges between paired cysteines, and therefore to present a three dimensional structure which contributes to the biological activity of the resulting protein. There is some evidence suggesting a particular disulfide bridging sequence wherein numbering the Cys residues in formula I above 1 through 6 going from left to right Cys 1 is bonded to Cys 3, Cys 2 is bonded to Cys 4 and Cys 5 is bonded to Cys 6 by disulfide bonds in biologically active forms of the basic protein structure. The exact chemical nature of the amino acid residues recited for the amino acid sequences spaced between the Cys residues in formula I do not appear to be particularly critical provided at least 10 different amino acids from the group recited for formula I are employed and no amino acid is repeated more than three times as consecutive residues in any given sequence. Of the amino acid residues listed for formula I, preference is given to Val, Ser, His, Phe, Lys, Asp, Thr, Gln, Leu, Glu, Pro, Ala, and Gly. A preferred group of biologically active polypeptides having at least one peptide sequence of formula I are polypeptides and oligomers thereof of the formula IV wherein AA is an amino acid residue selected from Val, Ser, His, Phe, Asn, Lys, Asp, Thr, Gln, Arg, Leu, Glu, Pro, Ala, Gly, Trp and Tyr, and n is an integer of from 4 to 10, m is 7, o is 4 or 5, p is 10, q is 8 and r is an integer of from 6 to 12. In this preferred group, even further preference is given to polypeptides or oligomers thereof wherein o is 4 and n and r are 7. With this preferred group, the amino acid residues designated by AA may also be Ile and or Met, in addition to the amino acid residues recited previously for formula IV. Most preferred are polypeptides wherein the amino acid residues in the sequences spaced between the Cys residues are selected from Val, Ser, His, Phe, Lys, Asp, Thr, Gln, Leu, Glu, Pro, Ala and Gly. Typically the polypeptides in accordance with formulas I and IV will have molecular weights ranging from about 5,000 to about 35,000. Preferred polypeptides in this respect have molecular weights in the range of 5,000 to 8,000. As noted above, the present invention also contemplates a new class of TGF polypeptides and oligomers thereof of the formula formula II above wherein R is Asp or Lys, R is Phe or Tyr, R is Ser or Phe, and R is Phe or Tyr. This novel class of polypeptides is derived from the finding that certain TGFs obtained from a variety of mammalian species both murine and human have substantial homology in the amino acid make up of thepeptide sequence greater than 90 of the sequences being identical as well as substantially the same biological properties. In particular, TGF polypeptides in accordance with the formula given above cause the loss of density dependent inhibition of cell growth in monolayer culture, overgrowth in monolayer culture, characteristic change in cellular morphology and acquisition of anchorage independent growth when applied to untransformed, non neoplastic indicator cells grown in culture. In addition to being extremely potent cell growth promoters and effectors of cell transformation, the TGF polypeptides in accordance with the above formula compete with EGF for binding to the cellular EGF receptor and also have the ability to activate an enzyme, a protein kinase, in human tumor cell membranes. Preferred TGF polypeptides of formula II above include those wherein R is Asp, R is Phe, R is Ser, and R is Phe, or where R is Lys, R is Tyr, R is Phe, and R is Tyr. As will be discussed in greater detail below, these TGF polypeptides may be suitably obtained from a variety of transformed human and murine cell lines, certain embryonic cell lines and body fluids of tumor carrying mammals using the isolation process of the invention or by conventional synthetic or recombinant means for synthesizing polypeptides. Typically the molecular weight of the TGF polypeptides and oligomers thereof of formula II will be in the range of from about 5,000 to about 35,000. In this regard, preference is given to TGF polypeptides having a molecular weight of about 5,000 to 8,000. Recognition of the substantial peptide sequence homology in the novel class of TGF polypeptides of formula II above and the commonality of biological properties associated therewith allows for further definition of a class of polypeptide growth factors which are within the scope of the present invention. These polypeptide growth factors are defined as containing one or more of the following peptide fragments Preferred polypeptides in this respect, include polypeptides containing a combination of peptide fragments A and C and polypeptides containing a combination of peptide fragments B and C. Most preferred are polypeptides containing fragments B, C and D. Here again, the polypeptide growth factors containing one or more of peptide fragments A, B, C and D will generally have a molecular weight in the range of from about 1,000 to about 35,000 preferably from 1,000 to 8,000. The lower end of the molecular weight range would include the above specified peptide fragments themselves as complete polypeptides having the characteristic growth factor biological activity. Previously it has been noted that the TGF polypeptides of the present invention are of value in the detection of malignancies in mammals since the production and or elevated levels of production of the TGF polypeptides are characteristic of morphologic transformation of certain human and murine cell lines. In this regard, antibodies to the TGF polypeptides have utility in diagnosis of malignancy since they can be used to detect extremely low levels of TGF polypeptide present in tumor cells or in body fluids. While the entire TGF polypeptide molecule can be used to generate antibodies both polyclonal and monoclonal , it is also possible, and advantageous from the standpoints of cost and technical effort, to determine various regions in the TGF polypeptide sequence which are likely to be determinant sites and to use these oligopeptides of at least about eight amino acids, typically at least about 10 and not more than about 20 amino acids, to define a hapten which can be used to induce antibody formation. As further discussed below, the oligopeptide is bound to an appropriate immunogen and introduced into a vertebrate to produce the desired antibodies. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a series of oligopeptides corresponding to antigenic regions in the TGF polypeptides. Exemplary species of the antigenic oligopeptides useful in generating antibodies in accordance with the present invention are listed below. Another compositional aspect of the present invention is directed to a class of oligopeptides which have therapeutic value in treatment of malignancies. These oligopeptides have the ability to bind to cellular growth factor receptors without causing phenotypic transformation of the cell and therefore they can effectively compete with TGF polypeptides for available receptor sites on the cell and interrupt or minimize cell transformation which is characteristic of TGF binding to cell receptors. The oligopeptides according to the invention which have the ability to bind to cellular receptors are of the formula formula III above The polypeptides and oligopeptides according to the invention as defined by the structural formulas formulas I through IV and peptide sequences given above can be prepared by synthetic techniques, techniques whereby the peptide is isolated from a naturally occurring source, e.g., cell lines and body fluids, and by techniques employing hybrid DNA technology. For those polypeptides and oligopeptides of the invention containing up to about 50 amino acid residues, conventional solid phase peptide synthesis is suitably employed. In this general synthetic procedure for making peptides, which is described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,341,761 to Ganfield et al., employs known side chain protecting groups and conventional polystyrene resins supports e.g., chloromethylated resins, hydroxymethyl resins or benzhydrylamine resins to affect the amino acid coupling. For polypeptides containing in excess of about 50 amino acid residues, the process according to the invention for isolating homogeneous TGFs from natural sources which is described in detail below can be suitably employed to obtain pure forms of the desired peptide. In this regard, particularly suitable sources of the TGF polypeptides according to the invention include serum free medium conditioned by retrovirus transformed Fischer rat embryo fibroblasts, in particular fibroblasts transformed with Snyder Theilen feline sarcoma virus, Moloney murine sarcoma virus transformed mouse 3T3 cells and human metastatic melanoma cell lines A2058 and A375. Sources and methods for suitable murine cell lines are described in DeLarco et al., 1980 The process according to the invention provides a uniquely effective means of obtaining TGF polypeptides in homogeneous form from various aqueous based fluids containing less pure forms of the TGF polypeptides such as serum free mediums conditioned by transformed cell lines which produce TGF polypeptides or body fluids, e.g., urine from mammals carrying malignancies or transformed cells which produce the TGF polypeptides. Important aspects of this unique isolation or purification process include an initial extraction or dialysis step using aqueous acetic acid, subsequent gel permeation chromatography ofthe acid soluble TGF containing activity, and finally, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using sequentially acetonitrile and 1 propanol in the presence of aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Broadly defined, this process involves isolation of a homogeneous transforming growth factor polypeptide from an aqueous medium containing said transforming growth factor polypeptide in impure form by the process steps comprising In a preferred application, the process according to the invention is employed to isolate homogeneous TGFs from serum free media conditioned by transformed, TGF producing cell lines. In this preferred application, the conditioned medium is suitably clarified, e.g., by centrifugation, and concentrated prior to dialysis and the TGF containing solvent phase from dialysis is suitably clarified, e.g., by centrifugation, as well as concentrated prior to gel permeation chromatography. In any case, the dialysis is suitably carried out using an aqueous acetic acid solvent having an acetic acid concentration of from 0.01 to 1 molar, with 0.1 molar acetic acid being preferred. The gel permeation chromatography may be carried out using a variety of gels conventionally employed to separate proteins or polypeptides based on molecular size. Suitable gels include dextran gels, agarose gels and polyacrylamide gels. In this regard, preference is given to polyacrylamide gel filtration resins Bio Gel such as Bio Gel P 10, Bio Gel P 30 and Bio Gel P 60, Bio Gel P 10 being especially preferred. The aqueous acetic acid used to condition the column and to elute the TGF containing fractions suitably has an acetic acid concentration of from 0.2 to 2.0 molar, with 1.0 molar acetic acid being preferred. The TGF containing fractions which elute from the column can be identified by determining their EGF competing activity and growth promotion activity in soft agar see experimental examples below . After gel permeation chromatography, the fractions containing TGF polypeptides in an enhanced state of purity are pooled together and concentrated, for example, by lyophilization as a preparative step for further purification by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC . The final stage of the purifiction process of the invention involves sequential HPLC with acetonitrile and 1 propanol in the presence of aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. This sequential HPLC can be carried out using one or more HPLC columns but it is preferred to carry out the sequential HPLC steps using a single HPLC column. The column packing employed is suitably a porous silica matrix to which a long chain hydrocarbon, for example, hydrocarbon containing 16 to 22 carbon atoms, is bound. Preferred packings are µBondapak hydrocarboncolumns, in particular µBondapak C₁₈ column 10 µm particle size, 0.39 x 30 cm, Waters Associates . Typically, the procedure is carried out under pressure, preferably in the range of from about 50 to about 5,000 psi. Prior to application to the column, the concentrated TGF containing fractions are reconstituted in an aqueous 1 to 10 trifluoroacetic acid and adjusted to a pH in the range of 2 to 5, preferably 3.5 by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. The column is suitably equilibrated with 0.01 to 0.1 aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, preferably 0.05 aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, before sample injection. The first elution is carried out with acetonitrile in a 0.01 to 0.1 , preferably 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid using a linear acetonitrile gradient acetonitrile concentration increased linearly at a gradient in the range of about 0.1 min to about 1 min . The elution is carried out over a time period of from 0.2 to 3 hours at a flow rate of about 0.2 to 2 ml min and at a temperature of from 10 to 50 C, preferably about 40 C. The pooled fractions containing TGF activity as determined by EGF competition and soft agar assay are concentrated, for example, by lyophilization, prior to the second step of the HPLC using 1 propanol solvent. For the second step of the sequential HPLC, the pooled and concentrated fractions from the first HPLC elution are reconstituted in 0.01 to 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid and rechromatographed on the same column or a second column equilibrated with trifluoroacetic acid ina manner identical to that used for the first column. This second elution is carried out with 1 propanol ina 0.01 to 0.1 , preferably 0.035 trifluoroacetic acid using a linear 1 propanol gradient. It is important for optimum results to employ a shallow linear 1 propanol gradient in this step. In particular, the 1 propanol concentration should be increased linearly at a gradient which does not exceed 0.1 min and preferably the linear 1 propanol gradient should be maintained between 0.01 min and 0.05 min during the elution. This second elution is suitably carried out over a time period of from 1 to 5 hours at a flow rate of about 0.5 to 5 ml min and at a temperature of from 10 to 60 C, preferably about 40 C. By controlling the linear 1 propanol concentration gradient at the shallow levels given above, it is possible to elute TGF polypeptides as well defined peaks of TGF activity in the form of homogeneous polypeptides. With the isolation process of the invention, it is possible to recover up to about 70 of the initial TGF activity in the impure starting matrial while achieving degrees of purification in excess of 200,000 fold. The homogeneous TGF polypeptides obtained by the isolation process of the invention typically have molecular weights in the range of about 5,000 to about 35,000 and are of sufficient purity to permit peptide sequencing. Preferred homogeneous TGF polypeptides which are obtained with theprocess of the invention include TGFs having apparent molecular weights of 7,400, 20,000 and 30,000 to 35,000. These homogeneous TGF polypeptides show characteristic biological properties of TGF polypeptides when they are applied to untransformed, non neoplastic indicator cells growing in culture including acquisition of anchorage independence, with the resultant ability to grow in soft agar. Further the homogeneous TGF polypeptides can be used to raise antibodies see below which have value in the detection and treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases in accordance with the invention. In this regard, it is not essential that each of the forms of the TGF be purified to homogeneity in order to produce antibodies to the different TGF peptides. These various forms of antibodies to the TGF polypeptides are also contemplated by this invention. Antibodies according to the invention include both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised to the TGF polypeptides of formula II given above, antigenic oligopeptides derived from the TGF polypeptides of formula II and the homogeneous TGF polypeptides obtained using the isolation process of the invention from various transformed cell lines and body fluids of mammals carrying malignancies or transformed cells. The antibodies according to the invention can be prepared in a variety of ways known in the art, depending on whether monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are desired. For polyclonal antibodies, a vertebrate, typically a domestic animal, is hyperimmunized with antigen and the blood collected shortly after repeat immunizations and the gamma globulin isolated. Suitable methods for preparing polyclonal antibodies are described in the Handbook of Experimental Immunology, 3rd edition, Weir, Editor, Blackwell Scientific publications, Oxford and London, 1978. For monoclonal antibodies, a small animal, typically a mouse or rat, is hyperimmunized with antigen, the spleen removed and the lymphocytes fused with myeloma cells in the presence of a suitable fusion promoter. The resulting hybrid cells or hybridomas are screened to isolate individual clones, each of which secrete a single antibody species to the antigen. The individual antibody species obtained in this way are each the product of a single B cell from the immune animal generated in response to a specific antigenic site recognized on the immunogenic substance. The general process for obtaining monoclonal antibodies, including those according to the invention, is described by Kohler and Milstein 1975 The antibodies according to the invention may be used in a variety of ways. In a preferred application, they may be used for diagnosis of malignancy and other proliferative diseases. In instances where the antigen may be found in a physiological fluid or at a concentration differential only when malignancy or other proliferative disease exists, the physiological fluid, such as serum plasma, whole blood or cerebrospinl fluid may be assayed. Antibodies employed in assays may be labeled or unlabeled. Unlabeled antibodies may be employed in agglutination labeled antibodies may be employed in a wide variety of assays, employing a wide variety of labels, such as radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescers, enzyme substrates or cofactors, or the like. These techniques are amply defined in the literature and exemplary assays may be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,817,834 3,935,074 4,233,402 and 4,318,980, as illustrative. In some techniques it will be useful to label the antigen or fragment thereof, rather than the antibody, and have a competition between labeled antigen and antigen in the sample for antibody. In this situation, it is common to provide kits which have the combination of the labeled antigen or labeled fragment and the antibody in amounts which provide for optimum sensitivity and accuracy. In other situations, it is desirable to have a solid support, where either antigen or antibody is bound. A polyepitopic antigen can serve as a bridge between antibody bound to a support and labeled antibody in the assay medium. Alternatively, one may have a competition between labeled antigen and any antigen in the sample for a limited amount of antibody. Where the antigen may not be found in a physiological fluid or if found there is not diagnostic of malignancy or the target proliferative disease, then cells will have to be isolated and the cells assayed for the presence of the antigen. For detecting the antigen, the tissue sample may be lysed by conventional methods, e.g., base, detergents, or the like, cellular debris separated by filtration or centrifugation and the filtrate or supernatant isolated and assayed. For purposes of therapy, either xenogeneic or allogeneic antibodies may be employed, depending upon the nature of the treatment, and whether the foreign antibodies will induce an immune response. The literature has described a number of ways of making human antibodies, where it is found that mouse or other mammalian antibodies are not satisfactory. The antibodies may be used in a wide variety of ways. By employing the appropriate IgG other than IgG₁ , one may induce lysis through the natural complement process. Alternatively, the lysing portion of a toxin may be joined to the antibodies, particularly a Fab fragment. The antibodies may be bound to liposomes for directing the liposomes to the malignant cells to become ingested by the cells by merging of the membranes. Other labels may also be bound to the antibodies, such as radionuclides, fluorescers, enzymes, and the like. By introducing the antibodies The formulation of the antibodies will vary widely, depending on the nature of the label, the purpose of the antibodies, the site to which the antibodies are to be directed, and the like. Usually, the antibodies will be formulated in a physiologically acceptable carrier, e.g. saline or phosphate buffered saline, and injected into the host, when possible at the desired site, and when this is not possible, into a circulating system, such as blood. The antibodies obtained in accordance with this invention can also be used to isolate cells expressing the TGF polypeptides and to remove cells Methods and compositions employing the biologically active polypeptides and oligopeptides of the invention are also afforded for treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases and for therapies wherein cell growth promotion is beneficial. In particular, compositions are provided employing the oligopeptides of formula III above for the treatment of malifnancies. Further compositions containing biologically active polypeptides of formulas I and II for treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases and for cell growth promotion application,s e.g., wound healing and ulcer therapy are also provided. These therapeutic compositions comprise effective amounts of the indicated oligopeptides and polypeptides in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In particular, pharmaceutical compositions that contain the oligopeptides and or polypeptides of the invention as an active ingredient will normally be formulated with an appropriate solid or liquid carrier depending upon the particular mode of administration being used. For instance, parenteral formulations are usually injectable fluids that use pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, or the like as a vehicle. Oral formulations, on the other hand, may be solid, e.g., tablet or capsule, or liquid solutions or suspensions. In the therapeutic methods of the invention, the oligopeptides and or polypeptides may be administered to humans in various manners such as orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intranasally, intradermally, and subcutaneously. The particular mode of administration and dosage regimen will be selected by the attending physician taking into account the particulars of the patient, the nature of treatment required, and or the disease and the disease state involved. For instance, damaged tissue from wounds is usually treated by daily or twice daily doses over a few days to a few weeks whereas tumor or cancer treatment involves daily or multidaily doses over months or years. The oligopeptide and or polypeptide therapy of the invention may be combind with other treatments and may be combined with or used in association with other chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agents for providing therapy against proliferative diseases, neoplasms, or other conditions against which they are effective. The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation hTGFs was purified from the serum free medium conditioned by a human metastatic melanoma line A2058 Todaro et al. 1980 The medium was collected by decantation, stored for up to 24 h at 4 C in the presence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride 1µ g ml , and clarified by continuous flow centrifugation at 32,000 rpm at 4 C. Flow rates of 5 liters h in the CF 32 continuous flow rotor Beckman in the model L5 50 ultracentrifuge Beckman were used. The supernatant, after high speed centrifugation, will be referred to as A2058 conditioned medium. The A2058 conditioned medium was immediately concentrated in the hollow fiber Dialyzer Concentrator Model DC10, type H1095 20 cartridge, Amicron Corp. at 10 C. The concentrate was drained after a 150 fold reduction in volume. The cartridge was washed with 1000 ml of Waymouth s medium. The ultrafiltrate was discarded. The combined retentate and cartridgewash after ultrafiltration of A2058 conditioned medium was dialyzed for 60 h against 0.1 M acetic acid in Spectrapor 3 dialysis tubing Spectrum Medical Industries . The retentate was centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 h at 4 C. The pellet was discarded. The supernatant was concentrated by lyophilization and reconstituted in 0.5 ml of 1 M acetic acid liter of original A2058 conditioned medium. Following concentration, dialysis, and centrifugation, the supernatant containing hTGF activity was further purified by gel permeation chromatography on a column 2.5 x 85 cm 420 ml bed volume of Bio Gel P 10 200 400 mesh, Bio Rad Laboratories . The column was equilibrated with 1 M acetic acid at 22 C. Samples of protein 65 115 mg in 1 M acetic acid 5 ml were applied to the column. To ensure a constant flow rate the column effluent was regulated at 12 ml h with a peristaltic pump. 4.8 ml fractions were collected. Aliquots were lyophilized for subsequent determinations of EGF competing activity and growth promoting activity in soft agar. Fractions representing the major portions of a given peak were pooled and concentrated by lyophilization. The final purification of hTGF was achieved by reverse phase HPLC, using the general procedure described in Marquardt et al. 1981 hTGFs containing pools were reconstituted in 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid and rechromatographed on the same column, previously equilibrated with 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid in water. The column was then eluted with a linear 1 propanol gradient in 0.035 trifluoroacetic acid. The column effluent was collected in 1.5 ml fractions. Aliquots were lyophilized for EGF competition and growth stimulation assays. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described in Laemmli 1980 Total protein was determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Prior to protein determination, the starting material was dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline to remove components of the culture medium interfering with the color reaction or lyophilized if samples had been dissolved in volatile acids. Protein was also determined by amino acid analysis. Lyophilized samples were hydrolyzed at 110 C for 24 h in evacuated Pyrex tubes with 0.1 ml of 6 N HCl containing 0.1 liquid phenol, and analyzed witha Durrum D 500 analyzer equipped with a PDP 8 A computing integrator using o phthalaldehyde for the fluorogenic detection of primary amines Bensen et al. 1975 Purified EGF was labeled with Na¹²⁵I by a modification of the chloramine T method as described in DeLarco et al. 1978 The assay for colony growth in soft agar, using normal rat kidney fibroblasts, clone 49F, was performed as reported in Todaro et al. 1980 hTGFs was isolated from serum free conditioned medium of the highly transformed human metastatic melanoma cell line, A2058. The quantitation of hTGFs was based on two of its properties the capacity to induce anchorage independent growth of normal rat kidney fibroblasts in soft agar, and the ability to compete with ¹²⁵I EGF for the EGF receptor sites on A431 human carcinoma cells. A summary of the steps leading to the isolation of hTGFs and its recovery is presented in Table I. To remove serum proteins, A2058 cells were extensively washed with Waymouth s medium prior to their culture in serum free medium. The supernatant fluids were collected every other day for a 2 week period. Culture conditions were such that at the end of the culture period more than 90 of the cells were still viable and attached as monolayers. The initial clarified A2058 conditioned medium of 136 liters, containing 1.02 g of total protein and 4525 units of EGF competing activity, was concentrated to about 900 ml using a hollow fiber concentrator with cartridges of 5000 molecular weight cutoff. The total EGF competing activity was retained and a recovery above 95 was obtained. Dialysis of the concentrated A2058 conditioned medium against acetic acid and subsequent centrifugation resulted in 95 recovery of the initial total EGF competing activity. 18 of the protein was acid insoluble and was discarded. The acid soluble, partially purified hTGF was subjected to gel permeation chromatography on Bio Gel P 10. The column was eluted with 1 M acetic acid. The bulk of the contaminating protein was eluted in the exclusion volume of the column and was well separated from the EGF competing activity and growth stimulating activity. Two peaks of activity were found to be well resolved from each other. Fractions with both EGF competing and growth stimulating activity P 10 A and P 10 B had apparent molecular weights of 10,500 and 6,800, respectively. Fractions having only one of the two activities were not observed. hTGF containing fractions were pooled as indicated, lyophilized, and further purified. The larger molecular weight TGF eluted from the column in a broad peak P 10 A0 and appeared to be associated with polypeptides of different sizes. P 10 A contained 46 of the initial EGF competing activity. The small molecular weight TGF eluted from the column in a sharp peak P 10 B and represented 45 of the initial total EGF competing activity. The cumulative yield of total input EGF competing activity from step 1 through the gel permeation chromatography step was 91 Table I . hTGF was eluted as two distinct major peaks that varied quantitatively from one preparation to another. In some preparations of A2058 conditioned medium essentially all the growth promoting activity was in the hTGFs region. hTGFs was further purified by reverse phase PHLC. Pool P 10 B, after gel permeation chromatography of the acid soluble EGF competing activity of concentrated A2068 conditioned medium on Bio Gel P 10, was reconstituted in 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid in water, and then chromatographed on a µBondapak C₁₈ column. EGF competing and growth stimulating activities in soft agar of individual fractions were determined. hTGFs was well separated from the bulk of contaminating protein which eluted at higher concentrations of organic solvent. Fractions containing hTGFs were pooled, lyophilized, and taken for rechromatography. A 57 fold purification of hTGFs after gel permeation chromatography was obtained. 80 of the initial EGF competing activity in pool P 10 B was recovered Table I . Rechromatography of the hTGFs containing fractions on µBondapak C₁₈ support was chosen for the final purification step since only relatively small losses of EGF competing activity were observed on these columns. In order to obtain a distinct separation of hTGFs from impurities, it was necessary to use a shallow linear 1 propanol gradient in 0.035 trifluoroacetic acid. The bulk of contaminating peptide material was separated from a well defined peak of activity. EGF competing and growth stimulating activities copurified with a distinct absorbance peak at 13 1 propanol. Fractions containing hTGFs were pooled and further analyzed. The purification of hTGFs was approximately 7000 fold after gel permeation chromatography with a yield of 33 of the initial total EGF competing activity. The overall recovery of hTGFs from step 3 through the final reverse phase HPLC step was 73 , and the recovery range per step was 80 100 Table I . The purity of the final hTGFs preparation was determined by analytical SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was stained with silver. One major polypeptide band, with an apparent M The receptor reactivity of hTGFs was compared with EGF in the radio receptor assay. The quantitation of hTGFs was based on amino acid analysis of a companion aliquot. Both hTGFs and EGF competed and ¹²⁵I EGF for the EGF receptor sites of A431 human carcinoma cells as shown in Fig. 3A. The specific EGF competing activity of hTGFs was found to 1 1.5 x 10⁶ units mg 1.1 ng of hTGFs or EGF were required to inhibit EGF binding by 50 hTGFs enabled normal anchorage dependent rat kidney cells, clone 49F, to grow in soft agar. The half maximal response of hTGFs in soft agar was reached with 1 EGF competing unit, or 1.1 ng of hTGFs, whereas EGF does not stimulate growth of these cells in soft agar even when tested with up to 10µ g. rTGF, mTGF and hTGF were purified from the serum free medium conditioned by Fisher rat embryo fibroblasts, FRE Cll0, a subclone of FRE 3A Sacks et al. 1979 The TGFs were prepared essentially by methods previously described in Example I for the purification of the melanoma derived hTGF. The retentate after ultrafiltration of conditioned medium was dialyzed against 0.1 M acetic acid, and the supernatant, after centrifugation, concentrated by lyophilization and reconstituted in 1 M acetic acid for subsequent gel permeation chromatography on a column 2.5 x 85 cm of Bio Gel P 10 200 400 mesh, Bio Rad Laboratories . The column was equilibrated with 1 M acetic acid. Fractions comprising the major EGF competing activity with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 7,000 were pooled and lyophilized. The final purification of rTGF, mTGF, and hTGF was achieved by reverse phase HPLC using the chromatography system described in Example I. The separations were performed on a µBondapak C₁₈ column 10 µm particle size, 0.39 x 30 cm, Waters Associates . The mobile phase was 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid and the mobile phase modifier was acetonitrile containing 0.045 trifluoroacetic acid. The concentration of acetonitrile was increased linearly 0.083 min during 2 h at a flow rate of 1 ml min at 4 C for elution of peptides. TGF containing pools were lyophilized and reconstituted in 0.05 trifluoroacetic acid and rechromatographed on the same column, using as the mobile phase modifier 1 propanol containing 0.035 trifluoroacetic acid. The 1 propanol concentration was increased linearly 0.05 min during 2 h at a flow rate of 1 ml min at 40 C. Pools of fractions comprising the major EGF competing activity were lyophilized. TGF was quantitated in a radioreceptor assay based on receptor crossreactivity with mouse submaxillary gland epidermal growth factor mEGF . Purified mEGF was labeled with Na¹²⁵I by a modification of the chloramine T method as described in Example I. The ¹²⁵I EGF binding assay was performed on formalin fixed A431 human carcinoma cells, 8 x 10³, in Micro Test II plates Falcon . The concentration of TGF was expressed in mEGF ng equivalents ml and was based on the amount of TGF required to produce equal inhibition of ¹²⁵I EGF binding to A431 cells as a known amount of unlabeled mEGF. For amino acid sequence analysis, rTGF 3 µg was reduced with dithiothreitol 20 mM in 100 1 of Tris HCl buffer 0.4 M containing guanidine HCl 6 M and Na₂ EDTA 0.1 , pH 8.5, for 2 h at 50 C, and subsequently S carboxamidomethylated with iodoacetamide 45 mM for 30 min at 22 C. The S carboxamidomethylated rTGF was de salted on a µBondapak C₁₈ column. Peptide was eluted with a gradient of aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.045 trifluoroacetic acid. The concentration of acetonitrile was increased linearly 1 min during 1 h at a flow rate of 1 ml min at 40 C. Automated sequence analyses Edman et al. 1967 Purified preparations of a small molecular weight rTGF, mTGF and hTGF were obtained from the conditioned medium of retrovirus transformed rat and mouse fibroblasts and two human melanoma cell lines, respectively. The purification was achieved by gel permeation chromatography of the acid soluble EGF competing activity on Bio Gel P 10 in 1 M acetic acid, followed by reverse phase HPLC on µBondapak C₁₈ support using sequentially a linear gradient of aqueous acetonitrile and subsequently 1 propanol containing 0.035 trifluoroacetic acid. The elution patterns of the final purification step of rTGF, mTGF and hTGF show that EGF competing activity co purified with a distinct absorbance peak, and was effectively separated from contaminating UV absorbing material. The major protein peak in rTGF, mTGF and hTGF preparations eluted from a µBondapak C₁₈ column under standard conditions between 48 and 55 min. Gel permeation chromatography on Bio Gel P 10 provided a separation of the small molecular weight TGFs from larger molecular weight TGFs and reduced the load of protein applied to a µBondapak C₁₈ column in the following purification step. The small molecuar weight TGFs represented 45 to 80 of the initial total EGF competing activity. Reverse phase HPLC of TGFs on µBondapak C₁₈ support in the following two purification steps was very efficient, each giving in a typical preparation a recovery range of 80 to 100 per step. The final recovery of the small molecular weight TGFs was approximately 70 , based on the maximal total EGF competing activity detected during the course of the purification. The average yield of purified rTGF was 90 ng liter, of mTGF 50 ng liter and of hTGF 10 ng liter of conditioned medium. This calculation is based on the specific activity determined for isolated TGFs and on the assumption that the EGF competing activity measured in the radioreceptor assay reflects levels of total large and small molecular weight TGFs only. No immunoreactive mEGF was detected in conditioned medium. The purity of rTGF, mTGF and hTGF, suggested by the chromatographic elution profiles, was assessed in the EGF radioreceptor assay and by amino acid sequence analysis. rTGF, mTGF and hTGF competed with ¹²⁵I EGF for the EGF receptor sites on A431 human carcinoma cells and were qualitatively and quantitatively nearly indistinguishable from mEGF. Hence, the final TGF preparations were believed to be highly purified and essentially at homogeneity. A single amino terminal sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation for rTGF, mTGF and hTGF. Any unblocked minor peptide sequence present at 5 could have been detected by the methods used. The homogeneity of hTGF was confirmed in addition by analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified preparation gave one major polypeptide band. The complete sequencing of the rTGF, mTGF and hTGF was accomplished and the amino acid sequences for the three polypeptides are given below. It will be noted from the sequences reported that rTGF and mTGF are identical in chemical make up and further that substantial homology exists between the murine TGFs and hTGF with different amino acid residues occurring at only positions 7, 15, 23 and 38 in the sequences. The sequence shown for hTGF has subsequently been found to be in error the correct sequence is on file at the European Patent Office. Tumor cell lines 1 x 10⁶ known to produce TGFs human melanoma and transformed rat were inoculated into athymic nude mice and tumors were allowed to develop. The urine from the tumor carrying mice was collected and analyzed for the presence of TGF using the isolation procedure and analytical techniques given in Example I above. TGF was detected in the urine of the tumor carrying mice which has the same size and elution properties on HPLC as does the cell culture derived TGF which is described in Examples I and II above. Further, using the procedures described in Example I above, the TGF present in the mouse urine was found to have the characteristic TGF biological properties, in that it stimulates anchorage independent growth of cells and binds to the EGF receptor. Subsequently, the tumors were removed from the tumor carrying mice and the urine of the mice after tumor removal was tested for the presence of TGF using the above mentioned procedures. In this case, no TGF was found having the characteristic elution properties on HPLC or TGF like biological activity. These results demonstrate that tumor cells produce TGF in whole animals as well as cell cultures and that TGF can be detected in and isolated from body fluids using the process of the invention. Similar experiments were also performed with rats having chemical carcinogen induced tumors and they were found to have TGF in their urine, based on the biological and biochemical properties listed above while untreated rats did not. An oligopeptide having the following amino acid sequence which corresponds to amino acid sequences 34 through 50 of rat TGF was synthesized using the solid phase technique of Ohgak et al. 1983 Antisera prepared in one rabbit and two sheep reacted with the corresponding peptide in peroxidase linked immunoassays in titers of at least 10⁴. Reactions of the rabbit antiserum with rat TGF were documented by immunoprecipitation and confirmed by Western blotting. The antipeptide antisera did not immunoprecipitate iodinated mouse EGF in this study. Human epidermoid A431 cells have in excess of 10⁶ EGF receptors per cell Fabricant et al. 1977 With the availability of antisera that blocked cellular binding of TGF but not EGF, it was possible to test whether TGF functions by an autocrine mechanism is stimulating the growth of malignant cells and whether antibody can thus inhibit such growth in vitro. Consequently, untransformed normal rat kidney cells NRK and a variety of retroviral cell lines were plated at low densitites 500 to 2,000 cells per dish in serum containing medium and after a brief period of adherence were switched to serum free medium. Sheep or rabbit antibodies to TGF peptide or to various irrelevant non cross reacting peptides were added to the medium, and the effect on cell growth, on microscopic and macroscopic colony formation, and on colonial morphology was observed. All antibodies were affinity purified on peptide columns, extensively dialyzed, concentrated, and reconstituted to an antipeptide titer of 10³ to 10⁴. The results are provided in Table II below. As seen in Table II, above, neither rabbit nor sheep anti TGF oligopeptide inhibited colony formation by NRK cells but within 48 hours inhibited growth of Kirsten Transformed NRK cells, feline sarcoma virus transformed rat embryo fibroblasts CLl0 cells , and Rous sarcoma virus transformed 3T3 cells. CLl0 cells were known to be prolific producers of TGF Marquardt et al. 1983 The chemical synthesis of rat TGF rTGF , having the chemical formula given in Example II, was performed manually by the stepwise solid phase approach according to the general principles described by Merrifield 1963 After HF treatment and prior to any purification, the crude and reduced synthetic rTGF was oxidized and regenerated by the mixed disulfide method in the presence of a combination of reduced and oxidized glutathione Ahmed et al. 1975 Under reducing or nonreducing conditions, the purified synthetic rTGF I was found to give a single band with an apparent M.W. of 7000 on SDS PAGE electrophoresis. Amino acid analysis by 6N HCl and enzymatic hydrolysis provided the expected theoretical molar ratio of the proposed sequence. No free thiol was detected by Ellman s method of sulhydryl determination on synthetic rTGF, but upon thiolytic reduction, the expected theoretical value of six cysteines was obtained. These findings support the conclusion that synthetic rTGF is a single chain polypeptide containing six cysteines in disulfide linkages, which is in agreement with the expected chemical properties of the natural rTGF. Additionally, synthetic rTGF coeluted with the natural rTGF as a single symmetrical peak in C 18 reverse phase HPLC. Synthetic rTGF prepared in accordance with this Example was compared with natural rTGF in three assays for biological properties of the putative transforming growth factor. In the mitogen assay, the stimulation of growth of serum deprived normal rat kidney cells by rTGF was measured by the incorporation of ¹²⁵I Iododeoxyuridine. In the soft agar assay in the presence of fetal bovine serum and a second TGF, TGF beta, the morphological and phenotypic alterations by rTGF could be quantitated by colony formation in soft agar. The latter transforming assay has been shown to correlate well with tumorigenicity Stoker et al. 1968 Since rTGF competes with mEGF for the binding of EGF receptors on cellular membranes, synthetic rTGF was compared with the natural rTGF for binding on A431 human carcinoma cells. Again, the response and activities of the natural synthetic rTGF were found to be indistringuishable from each other. The concentration required for 50 inhibition of ¹²⁵I EGF binding was found to be 3.5 and 4.1 nM for the natural and synthetic rTGF respectively. A consequence of TGF or EGF binding to the EGF membrane receptors is the stimulation of phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of synthetic peptides or endogenous substrates Pike et al. 1982
