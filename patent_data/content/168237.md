## Description
Piston and Cylinder Apparatus.This invention relates to piston and cylinder apparatus and relates especially but not exclusively to such apparatus wherein a piston is intended to operate in a cylinder without added lubrication.The most commonly used air compressors for charging reservoirs in compressed air systems such as installed on vehicles for braking and other functions employ conventional metallic piston reciprocably slideable in cast iron cylinder bores and they require a suitable lubricating oil supply. Such compressors are usually driven by the vehicle engine and also receive their lubricating oil supply from the engine. There is, therefore, an inherent practical constraint placed upon the positioning of the compressor on the vehicle.Additionally, such compressors tend to permit carry over of oil vapour or droplets with the compressed air into the compressed air system and precautions such as filters and drain valves are essential to prevent such oil reaching sensitive working parts of the system. Such filters tend to become blocked and therefore require frequent replacement.Various proposals have been made to construct substantially oil free piston and cylinder compressors the bearings of which have sealed in lubrication and one object of the invention is to provide an improvement to such compressors. According to the present invention there is provided a piston and cylinder apparatus having a substantially non deformable piston core characterised by a bearing or wear sleeve located thereon before insertion into the cylinder bore, said sleeve being formed of a materiial offering sliding wear resistance compatible with the cylinder bore and being provided with an integral inwardly resiliently deflectable compression seal slidingly and sealingly engageable with the cylinder bore.In one embodiment said bearing or wear sleeve extends over the full length of the skirt of the piston and is provided with an inner bead locatable with the piston core.The moulded sleeve may be closed at one end so as to enclose the head of the piston core.In an alternative embodiment, said . bearing or wear sleeve may be located in a circumferential groove of the piston.In an embodiment when the groove of the piston is located near the top of the piston a further bearing or wear ring may be located in a groove near the lower end of a skirt Df the piston.In order that the invention may be more clearly understood and readily carried into effect the same will be further described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Fig. 1 a illustrates one example in part sectional diagrammatic view,Fig. 1 b illustrates in its free state a moulded piston sleeve used in the apparatus of Fig.1.Fig. 1 c is a further view of the moulded sleeve taken on the direction of the arrow A .Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate an alternative embodiments andFig. 4 illustrates an example of a double acting piston assembly.Referring to the part sectional view of a portion of a single cylinder air compressor, as shown in Fig. 1 of the drawing, the cylinder is denoted by reference 1 and a cylinder head and valve plate assembly which is normally bolted on is represented by the block 2.The gudgeon pin end of a connecting rod 3 is provided with a sealed in needle bearing 4 and a gudgeon pin 5 with end pads, one of which is shown at 6. The gudgeon pin 5 is retained in an aluminium piston core 7 by means of locked in set screws 16. The piston core 7 is provided with a moulded polytetrafluorethylene cup shaped bearing shroud 8 before insertion into aluminium bore of cylinder 1. The natural moulded form of the skirt of shroud 8 is as shown at 9 in Fig. 1 b of the drawings. The lower edge of the skirt carries an inwardly projecting bead 12 of thickness which varies as shown in Fig. 1 c and which when deflected inwards engages a rebate at the lower edge 13 of the skirt of the inner core 7.To permit such inward deflection the skirt of the cup shaped liner has axial slots such as 15 extending upwards to a point somewhat below the root of the sealing part 10. Surrounding a head portion 14 which is of smaller diameter than the remainder of the piston skirt, there is resiliently deformable annular sealing part 10, the undeformed shape of which is shown inFig. 1 b . In order to insert the thus assembled piston in the cylinder the skirt 9 of the shroud and the annular seal part 10 are compressed inwardly to reduce this diameter to fit the cylinder bore and upon entry into the bore. The inwardly projected bead 12 is thus brought into engagement with the lower edge rebate 13 of the piston core thereby retaining the liner and the piston core together in operation.As an alternative to the bead 12 engaging with the lower edge of the piston core, lugs may be provided within the shroud 8 to locate in the transverse gudgeon pin recesses of the piston core 7 to retain the sleeve in position on the core.Referring to Fig. 2, an alternative piston construction is shown wherein the gudgeon pin end of a connecting rod 23 is provided with a sealed bearing or bush 24 and the gudgeon pin is again located in the core of the piston by a small locked locating set screw 25. The piston core is formed of a lower part 21 between which and an upper part 22 is clamped, by screws 20, an an inwardly projecting annular retaining bead 26 of a carbon filled polytetrafluorethylene bearing sleeve. The bearing sleeve has a resiliently deformable seal bead 28 similar to the seal bead 11 of Fig. 1 and a similarly slotted skirt portion 29 with a lower inwardly projecting bead 30 locating in an annular rebate 31 formed in the lower edge of the piston core part 21.In a variant of Fig. 2 the lower bead 30 may be dispensed together with and the mentioned slots. The skirt is then required simply to be press fitted over the lower part 21 of the piston core before attachment of the upper part 22.In yet another variant of the arrangement shown in Fig.2, the gudgeon pin 25 may be located by screws such as 20 which are positioned and having projections made long enough to extend into one or more suitable locating holes provided in the gudgeon pin.In yet another variant of the arrangment of Fig. 2 the mentioned holes in the gudgeon pin may be tapped with screw threads to receive the screws 20 which are then preferably a clearing fit in the lower part of the piston core.In yet another bariant, the lower part of the piston core may be cut away in way of the gudgeon pin permitting assembly of the gudgeon pin thereto from beneath to be retained in position by screws tapped into the gudgeon pin. Ir. a further variant on the arrangement shown in Fig.1 the bearing shroud 8 may be replaced, as shown inFig. 3 by upper and lower bearing rings 40 and 41 located in respective grooves 42 and 43 formed in the main body 44 of an aluminium air compressor piston. As in the cases of Figs. 2 and 3, the gudgeon pin 45 is located in the transverse bore 46 of the piston by at least one retaining screw 147. The connecting rod 48 is pivotable on a sealed bush or bearing 49 as before.The upper bearing ring 40 is fomred with a section generally as shown on an enlarged scale in Fig. 4b from which it will be seen that this ring comprises an upper thickened bearing portion 50 and a lower portion 51 which extends radially upwards and is deflectable through a position such as shown dotted when the piston is inserted in an aluminium bore of a cylinder indicated by the broke lines 52 of Fig. 3 a . The upper bearing ring 40 and the lower bearing ring 41 are manufactured by compression moulding or by machining from a suitably carbon filled polytetrafluorethylene material but other suitable plastics materials such as polyetheretherketone may be used. The dimensions of these bearing rings and the depth of the upper and lower grooves 42 and 43 formed in the piston body 44 are such as to permit the bearing rings 40 and 41 to be stretched over the external diameter of the main body 44 to locate in the respective sections. The essential requirement for the war rings is that they both shall jointly operate to prevent contact between the piston44 and the interior of the cylinder bore 52 and a sufficiently good degree of sealing is provided by the seal portion 51 through the useful life of the compressor.Referring now to the double acting piston and cylinder apparatus as part shown in Fig. 14, a non deformable piston core 32 is carried on a spigot 38 of a piston rod 39. A resiliently deformable polytetrafluorethylene wear sleeve 33 is stretched over the periphery of the piston, an inner bead 34 of the sleeve serving to position and retain the sleeve on the piston core by engaging with a matching groove 35 of the core. The sleeve is further provided with two annular deformable seal parts 35, 36 the undeformed shape of which is again shown at 35 and 36. These seal parts are resiliently deformed on assembly to make sealing and sliding contact with the bore 37 of a cylinder as shwon and they are arranged to act in opposing senses in relation to the cylinder bore so that a double acting piston is provided with a single deformable bearing sleeve. Whilst the piston core of each of the above described embodiments is preferably to be made of aluminium, other suitable substantially non deformable materials may be used.In the case of suitable plastics material being used the advantages of injection or compression moulding may be enjoyed. Moreover, although the bearing or wear rings or sleeves are made of polytetrafluorethylene, other materials such as polyetheretherketone may be employed.
