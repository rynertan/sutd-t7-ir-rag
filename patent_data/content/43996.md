## Description
The present invention relates generally to adsorption processes utilizing agglomerated bodies of crystalline zeolitic molecular sieves, and more particularly to improved large scale adsorption drying processes utilizing extruded molecular sieve agglomerates hazing a generally trilobal cross sectional configuration. Commercial molecular sieve adsorption processes such as drying, desulfurization and CO2 removal from feed streams are ordinarily of the dynamic type in which the feedstock gas is passed through a large fixed bed of agglomerates of the adsorbent zeolite. Such agglomerates are usually formed by blending a moist mass of zeolite crystals with a suitable binder, such as alumina, clay, silica or silica alumina cogel and water, and shaping the resulting homogeneous mixture into the desired shape by extrusion, rolling, tabletting, accretion or other conventional forming methods. The body or agglomerate so formed is dried and activated by heating, usually at temperature in the range of 350 to 700 C. In general it is found that a number of factors must be balanced in order to obtain efficient operation of adsorption processes. To selectively adsorb molecules from flowing gas or liquid streams, those molecules must be transferred from the fluid phase to the solid adsorbent phase. This transfer must be rapid and uniform throughout the adsorbent particles in order to minimize the length of the dynamic mass transfer zone in the adsorption bed, and this result is favored by small adsorbent particles. Although the process flow rate, bed configuration and other conditions affect the length of the mass transfer zone, the adsorbent particle size is the predominant factor. A decrease in the particle size, however, results in an increase in pressure drop across the adsorption bed, with a consequential in . crease in energy.and construction material costs.Accordingly, with respect to acceptable pressure drops, there is a minimum adsorbent particle size which can be employed. Having selected the minimum particle size for a given process, it is. important that the particles installed in the adsorption apparatus do not degrade in cyclic use to form smaller particles which create unacceptable pressure drops. Heretofore a very large number of proposals have been made to increase the hydrothermal stability of adsorbent agglomerates so that particle break up is decreased. In the main these proposals have to do with either the composition of the binder material employed, or the method for combining the zeolite crystals with the binder material. Examples of the former type are to be found in U.S.P. 3,219,590tin which kaolin type clay combined with lignosulfonates is disclosed as an improved binder material, and, in U.S.P. 3,181,231 in which the use of metal flakes as a component of the binder system is proposed.Examples of the latter type are disclosed in U.S.P. 3,234,147 and U.S.P. 3,394,989 in which a case hardening with an alkali metal silicate and the in situ formation of the zeolite crystals in the preformed precursor particle are described, respectively.Regardless of the chemical composition or the method of formation, however, the adsorbent agglomerates were, insofar as is known, without exception dense convex shapes, particularly cylindrical solids or spheroidal beads. It has now been surprisingly found that certain concave geometrical agglomerate adsorbent particles not only exhibit the expected suitability in adsorption performance, but also exhibit a substantial improvement in hydrothermal stability during fixed be cyclic adsorptiondesorption operations. Although such concave configurations have been found to be advantageous as catalyst agglomerates for use in certain fixed bed hydrocarbon conversion reactors, U.S.P. 3,966,6y4 issued June 29, 1976 toW.R. Gustafson hydrothermal abtise is not a significant factor in such processes and, accordingly, the correlation between the configuration of the catalyst particle and hydrothermal stability has not been observed.Consequently it has never heretofore been proposed to utilize agglomerates of such configurations in adsorption processes in whichwater contacts the adsorbent at some stage of the process. In fact, the higher surface tomass ratio of these concave particles would suggest a decrease in hydrothermal stability in comparison with a convex form having a higher bulk density such as a cylindrical form. In the aforesaid Gustafson patent the complexities of the shape and size characteristics of the concave particles used in the present invention are discussed and defined with uncommon clarity. Portions of this disclosure are, therefore, adapted for use herein with acknowledgment. As generally perceived, a cylinder can be defined as a solid of uniform cross section which is generated by a straight line moving parallel to a fixed straight line and intersecting a circular curve in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the fixed straight line. The adsorbent particles of the present invention differ from the circular cylinder only in that the curve intersected by the moving straight line, i.e. the crosssectional base, is a concave closed curve consisting of three lobes of circles, preferably of essentially equal diameter. The centers of the circular lobes are spaced apart so as to form a triangle, at least one side of which is from about 3 8 to 15 16 of the largest circle diameter, and all area occupied by the lobes and triangle is filled with constituents of the adsorbent composition used to form the adsorbent particles.Preferably the cross sectional base is formed of three lobes of circles of essentially equal diameter, the centers of which when connected by straight lines form essentially an equilateral triangle whose sides are from 3 8 to 15 16 of a circle diameter. For any concave agglomerate of this invention the length is from 10 to 30 times the surface area of the cross sectional base. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an adsorbent particle which has a regular three leaf clover or trilobal cross sectional base. Fig 1A is a cross sectional end view through the plane of line A A of Fig. 1. Since it is not convenient hereinafter to set forth all of the critical dimensions of each trilobal agglomerate prepared or used, such agglomerates are referred to in terms of nominal size designations which correspond to the diameter of the smallest circle which circumscribes the base cross sectional trilobe. Thus agglomerates which have nominal size designations of 1 8 , 3 32 and 1 16 would have the various dimensions set forth in Table I, below. Reference letters used in the Table correspond to those appearing Fig. 1 and Fig. 1A. TABLE I Nominal Size Designation, In.Measurement 1 8 3 32 1 16 1.

Angle , degrees 60 60 60 Neither the chemical composition nor the method of preparation of the trilobe agglomerates of the present invention are critical factors since the improvement in hydrothermal stability appears to be solely a function of the trilobe configuration. This is not to say, however, that all agglomerates regardless of composition and method of manufacture will have the same attrition resistance under hydrothermal abuse. Rather each will be improved compared to agglomerates otherwise identical except that their configuration is convex.In general the agglomerates comprise crystals of at least one species of molecular sieve zeolite having pores at least 3 Angstroms in diameter and a binder material which comprises an inert refractory inorganic oxide such as silica, alumina, magnesia, titania or, preferably, a clay such as kaolin, attapulgite, montmorillonite and the like,which are well known in the art of forming adsorbent zeolite agglomerates. Preferred zeolites are those commonly known as 3A, 4A, 5A and 13X but any of the numerous other synthetic and natural zeolites such as mordenite, acid treated mordenite and chabazite can be used. The precedure for preparing the trilobe agglo mera,tes of the present invention comprises any, of the methods well known in the art but preferably involves intimately blending the various constituents with sufficient water to form a plastic fordable, mass, forming agglomerates into the trilobal configuration, and calcining the agglomerates thus formed at a temperature of from about 6000C to 7000C for a period of 1 2 to 1 hour. A preferred sequence of preparation comprises mulling the ingredients for about 1 to 3 hours to achieve a final moisture content in the mull cake of from 39.5 to 41.0 weight percent, based on the weight of the dehydrated product after calcination at 10000C for 1 hour.The mull cake is then extruded, using the trilobe shaped die orifice, chopping the extrudate into approximately 1 4 lengths, and thereafter drying the trilobe bodies at a temperature of from 100 to 3500C for about 5 minutes and then firing at 625 to 7000C for about 0.5 hour. Typical embodiments of the preparative process are set forth in the Examples hereinafter appearing. The hydrothermally abusive adsorption separation or purification processes which are improved by the use of the above described trilobe particles can be any carried out in a fixed bed in which water, either in the liquid or the vapor phase, contacts the adsorbent particles at a temperature in excess of about 1000C during at least one of the cyclic process steps which include a adsorption, wherein at least one constituent of a fluid stream passing over the adsorbent is effectively removed from said stream by selective adsorption on the adsorbent b void space purging, wherein unadsorbed material in the bed void space is forced from the adsorbent bedaby displacement with another fluid and c desorption, wherein fluid molecules adsorbed in the intracrystalline cavities of the zeolite crystals of the adsorbent particles are desorbed by the establishment of a substantially non equilibrium state between the adsorbed phase and the atmosphere over the adsorbent particles. It is immaterial whether the water is a constituent of the primary fluid stream being treated, a purge fluid stream used in voidspace purging or desorption, or whether the water is formed in situ in the adsorption bed by reaction between two or more constituents of any fluid stream passed cyclically through the adsorbent bed.Particular examples of processes which advantageously utilize the trilobal adsorbent particles of this invention are drying of natural gas streams, desulfurization of natural gas streams which contain molecular oxygen and therefor produce water in situ in the bed by reaction with hydrocarbon molecules of the feedstock or purge gas, cracked gas drying ethylene drying and the sweetening of hydrocarbon steams which contain CO2 in addition to H2S wherein the adsorbent is maintained with a small level loading of adsorbed water to suppress the catalytic activity of the zeolite toward the formation of COS by the reaction of C02 and H2S. Many other processes of these kinds will be obvious to those skilled in the art. A method for preparing the trilobate adsorbent particles useful in the present.processes and also the test data obtained from carrying out simulated adsorption processes therewith are set forth in the following examples. Example 1 Preparation of the trilobal adsorbent 3A a A quantity of zeolite 3A filler cake containing 7258 grams of water free solids and 4621 grams of free water was placed.in a mulling apparatus. To this was added 1650 grams of attapulgus clay containing an additional 335 grams of adsorbed water , 136 grams of ligno sulfonate, and 90.7 grams of extrusion aid.The combined ingredients were then mulled for 16 minutes.Thereafter, an additional 1300 grams of water was added and mulling continued for another 30 minutes. At the end of this 30 minute mulling period 272.2 grams of glass fibers equivalent spherical diameter 20 microns aspect ratio 15 were added slowly to the contents of the muller, with the mulling procedure continuing over the course of addition of fibers. Mulling was carried on for another 30 minutes, after addition of the fibers was complete. The mulled composition, having a volatiles content of 40.47c by weight as determined by ignition at 1000 C, was removed from the muller and immediately divided into 3 equal weight portions of 4990 grams each. One of these portions was placed in a 3 diameter auger extruder and forced through a die containing 80 capillaries each of which was 1 4 long and had the cross sectional area in the shape of a trilobe. The portion of mix passed through the die at an overall rate of 3400 gms min.at a temperature within the range of 100 to 1500F. b Similarly, a second portion was forced through the same extruder, but with a standard 1 8 diameter capillary die. The third portion was forced through a standard 1 16 diameter capillary die.

Example 4 Preparation of the trilobal adsorbent 13X a A quantity of zeolite Type 13X filter cake containing 7076 gms of water free solids and 5873 gms of free water was placed in a mulling apparatus. To this was added 2334 gas of Avery clay containing an additional 338 gms of adsorbed water and 272 gms of extrusion aid. The combined ingredients were then mulled for 15 minutes. At the end of the 15 minute period, no additional water was necessary and the mix was mulled for an additional 60 minutes. The mulled composition, having a volatiles content of 41 .8 by weight as determined by ignition at 10000C, was removed from the muller and immediately divided into 3 equal weight portions of 5185 gms each. One of these portions was placed in a 3 diameter auger extruder and forced through a die containing 80 capillaries, eaqh of which was 1 2 long and had the cross sectional area in the shape of a trirobe. The portion of mix passed through the die at an overall rate of 2815 gms min at a temperature within the range of 100 to 1500F. b Similarly, the two remaining portions were extruded on the same extruder but through standard 1 8 and 1 16 diameter capillary dies, each 1 2 thick.

HYDROTHERMAL STABILITY As used herein, the cyclic hydrothermal stability of the involved agglomerates is measured in terms of the percentage of test agglomerates which are broken when subjected to simulated hydrothermal service.The test employs 200 grams of shaped Fagglomerates. Before being charged to a fixed adsorption bed, the sample is screened to remove any particles smaller than 7 mesh U.S. Standard . The feed to.the bed is a steam air mixture from which any entrained water is removed by a demister. The operating conditions are as follows Adsorption temperature, OF . 90 Desorption temperature, 0F 480 Adsorption flow rate, SCFM 13.5 Desorption flow rate, SCFM 3.5 Water concentration in feed, ppm vol. 4500 Weight of packed bed, grams 200 Bed length, inches 8 Bed diameter, inches 1.770 Adsorption time, minutes 45 downflow Desorption time, minutes 45 downflow There is no provision for a separate cooling step. The regenerated beds are cooled to the adsorption temperature of 900F as part of the 45 minute adsorption cycle.After the sample has undergone 50 cycles in the manner described above, the sample is allowed to remain in the unit for 1 1.5 hours on an adsorption step. Next, the sample is removed from the unit and is again screened on a 7 mesh screen to separate any broken up material. Both the latter fraction 7 mesh and the retained 7 mesh fraction are weighed. The percent breakup is Weight of 7 mesh particles x 100 Weight of initial sample hydrated The sample retained on the screen is returned to the test unit. After 150 cycles the sample is evaluated in the same manner. Each 150 cycle break up value reported hereinafter is the sum of the individual percentages measured after 50 and 150 cycles. Example 5 Using the hydrothermal stability test described above, samples of extruded trilobal particles as prepared in Examples 1 4 supra and, having nominal cross sectional diameters of 1 16 and 1 8 inch respectively, were compared with extruded right circular cylindrical particles of the same chemical composition and having diameters of 1 16 and 1 8 inch respectively.

The 1 16 inch trilobal particle, however, proved more resistant to break up than the 1 8 inch cylindrical particle. Similar results are observed in the case of the trilobal particles containing other zeolite species.
