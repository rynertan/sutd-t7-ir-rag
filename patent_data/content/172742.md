# Detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Alkyl ether sulphates are disclosed that are derived substantially wholly from C₁₂ and C₁₃ alcohols, at least 50 by weight being branched at the 2 position and at least 30 by weight being 2 ethyl or more highly branched. Foaming detergent compositions containing an alkylbenzene suiphon ate and or a dialkyl sulphosuccinate in combination with an alkyl ether sulphate of this specific type exhibit excellent foaming and detergency and are especially suitable for hand dishwashing.
