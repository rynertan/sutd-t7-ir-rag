# Stable tannin based polymer compound.

## Abstract
An aqueous flocculant solution containing a tannin based polymer compound is produced which is stable and has a shelf life of at least 3 6 months before gelling. The solution is made by reacting at a temperature of from about 150 200 F a tannin, an amino compound, and an aldehyde under slightly acidic conditions where the pH is less than 7 and where the molar ratio of the primary amine from the amino compound to the tannin repeating unit is from about 1.5 1 to 3.0 1. The intermediate viscoslty of the reaction mixture is monitored until the reaction mixture has an intermediate viscosity within the range of the system key intermediate viscosity range. This system key intermediate viscosity range is previously determined for each reactant system to be employed. It is a narrow intermediate viscosity range that is experimentally determined which permits the resulting product to have a long shelf life. The narrow system key intermediate viscosity range will generally be within the range of from about 2 100 cps when measured at 180 F on a Brookfield LVT viscometer. When this viscosity is reached, the reaction is terminated and the solids content of the liquid is adjusted to about 20 to 60 by weight and the pH is adjusted to a value of less than 3.0.
