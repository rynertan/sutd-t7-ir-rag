# Apparatus for recording an information signal comprising a video signal and an audio signal.

## Abstract
Apparatus for recording an information signal compris ing at least an analog audio signal in a plurality of successive tracks 2A, 2B on a magnetic tape 2 includes a PCM processing circuit 22 for converting an analog audio signal into a PCM audio signal, a video signal processing circuit 13, 14, 19 for processing a video signal to produce an output video signal, a rotary magnetic head assembly 1A, 1B for recording the output video signal and the PCM audio signal in the plurality of successive tracks 2A, 2B on the tape 2 , a switch assembly 17A, 17B for supplying the output video signal and the PCM audio signal to the rotary magnetic head assembly 1A, 1B , and a control circuit 34, etc for controlling the switch assembly 17A, 17B to supply the output video signal and the PCM audio signal to the rotary magnetic head assembly 1A, 1B during a video use mode so that the rotary magnetic head assembly 1A, 1B records the output video signal in a main section of each track 2A, 2B and to supply only the PCM audio signal to the rotary magnetic head assembly 1A, 1B during an audio use mode so that the rotary magnetic head assembly 1A, 1B records the PCM audio signal in different segments of the main section and overscan section of each track 2A, 2B .
