## Description
HERBICIDAL 2,6 BIS FLUOROMETHYL DIHYDROPYRIDINE 3,5 DICARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS Background of the Invention The invention herein pertains to the field of herbicides and more particularly to the field of novel 2 or 6 fluorinated methyl dihydropyridine 3, 5 dicarboxylic acid esters. Various dihydropyridines have been known in the art and utilized for various purposes. For example, U.S. Patent 3,969,359 discloses 3,5 dicyano 1,4 dihydropyridines which are useful commercially in scintillation applications as detectors of radioactive radiation. Dihydropyridines have been utilized for medicinal purposes as exemplified in U.S. Patent 3,441,648 which discloses a large number of 1,4 dihydropyridines. Of particular interest are the 3,5 dicarboxylate compounds having 2,6 substitution.Such compounds are utilized to reduce blood pressure when administered internally. The most active compounds appear to be those substituted at the 4 position by aryl and heterocyclic radicals wherein the hetero atom is either nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen. Also, trifluoromethylphenyl radicals in the 4 position appear to be highly active in reducing blood pressure in animals. Of more relevance herein, there is reported by Balicki et al in Polish Patent 89,493, a method for preparing 4 substituted derivatives of 2,6 bis trifluoromethyl 3,5 dicarbethoxy 1,4 dihydro pyridines. According to the Polish patent, the compounds have not been previously reported in literature and the compounds so prepared have valuable pharmacological properties, e.g., cytotoxic, bacteriostatic and hypotensive uses as well as intermediate products in the synthesis of new sutstituted heterocyclic compounds.According to the patent, such compounds are prepared by the reaction of an aldehyde R CHO in which R represents an alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbons, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group or a heterocyclic group wherein the hetero atom is nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur with ethyl trifluoroacetoacetate in the presence of a concentrated aqueous solution of ammonia. One molecular equivalent of aldehyde is reacted with two molecular equivalents of the 3 ketoester in aqueous ammonia in the presence of an organic solvent, preferably a lower aliphatic alcohol. The compounds so obtained are identified only by their melting points. However, it has been further reported in the Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, Vol. 17, pages 1109 and 1110 by Singh, et al that the compounds actually prepared by Balicki et al are dihydroxypiperidines rather than dihydropyridines. Singh1 et al reports that they have unequivocally shown that products formed by the reaction of ethyl trifluoroacetoacetate with an aromatic aldehyde and a concentrated aqueous solution of ammonia do not have the dihydropyridine structure, but rather are substituted piperidines. Singh reported that oxidation of theBalicki et al reaction product with nitric acid and several other reagents failed to produce a conversion of the reaction product to the corresponding pyridine. As pointed out in the Singh et al publication, the oxidation procedure is commonly used to convert 1,4 dihydropyridines to the corresponding pyridines, but such conversion did not occur indicating that the reaction product of the process described by Balicki did not provide 1,4 dihydropyridines. To further substantiate the failure ofBalicki et al to teach the preparation of the 2,6 bistrifluoromethyl 4 substituted 1,4 dihydropyridine 3, 5 dicarboxylic acid ester there was provided a series of compounds of structures 1 and 2 of Table I below which were tested to determine their respective melting points. The metling points of compounds 1 and 2 prepared by me were compared to the melting points reported by Balicki et al for the compounds reportedly prepared by them. The results are presented in Table I below. TABLE IEMI3.1 Ra Melting Point OC 1 2 ReportedCH3 1.4394a 133 135 133 134C2H5 1.4441a 129 131 131 132C3H7 1.4427a 140 142 132 133 2 furyl 1.4721a 129 130 128 129 2 thienyl 1.434 a 103 105 4 pyridyl 171 172 179 177 178 phenyl 42 45 99 101 92 93 a The data in Table I provides evidence that the compounds reported by Balicki were, in fact, dihydroxypiperidine and not dihydropyridines.Balicki et al in a later publication Polish Journal of Chemistry, p. 2439, 1981 corrected the structure assignntents of products derived from ethyl trifluoroacetoacetate, aldehydes, and aqueous ammonia as compounds 2. The dihydroxypiperidines 2 prepared by the method described by Balicki et al consist of a mixture of cis and trans isomers represented by the structure A cis isomer and B trans isomer as shown below. The structures of the compounds produced by the method of Balcki are further confirmed by X ray crystallography to be dihydroxypiperidines. The isomeric mixture produced by Balicki s method can be further purified by recrystallization to produce predominantly one isomer.In general, the products presently obtained by the method of Balicki et al have a higher melting point than those reported. This is due to more careful purifications of the isomeric mixture of 2 to provide single cis isomer.EMI4.1 In U.S. 4,145,432 there is disclosed 1,4 di hydropyridines useful in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension in human beings. The active compounds are 3,5 dicarboxylate esters, while the 4 position is occupied by an aryl or heterocyclic group. In addition, the 2 and 6 positions of the dihydropyridine ring are occupied by radicals selected from a wide range of groups including lower alkyl and substituted lower alkyl radicals.Disclosed intermediate compounds include 2,6 halo lower alkyl substitution. Also reported inGerman patent DE 2,659,665 as coronary dilators are 1,4 dihydropyridine derivatives containing a 5 cyano, 3 carboxylate substitution as well as a 2,6 dialkyl substitution. The 4 position of these compounds is occupied by a nitrophenyl radical. In European patent 44,262 there is reported 1, 4 dihydropyridines containing anilides. However, none of the reported compounds contain substitution at the 4 position and fluoroalkyl groups at the 2and 6 positions. Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to herbicidally active compounds, intermediates which provide herbicidally active compounds, a process for preparing the same, herbicidal compositions containing these compounds and herbicidal method of use of said compositions in agricultural crops.The novel compounds of this invention are characterized by the formula 3, 4, and 5 EMI5.1 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of phenyl, alkyl, C3 C6 cycloalkyl, haloalkyl, lower alkoxyalkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, lower alkylthioalkyl, lower alkylcarbonyloxyalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, cycloalkanylalkyl, and heterocyclic radicals having 3 6 atoms in the ring with 1 3 of the atoms being hetero atoms selected from nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen, each R1 is independently selected from C14 4 alkyl radicals and each R2 is independently selected from fluorinated methyl and R3 is selected from alkyl and fluorinated methyl radicals. The term alkyl means herein both straight and branched chain C16 6 alkyl radicals which include, for example, ethyl, methyl, propyl, n butyl, pentyl, hexyl, isobutyl, isopropyl l methylpropyl, neopentyl and 1 ethylpropyl. The term C3 6 cycloalkyl11 means cycloalkyl radicals such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Typical lower alkoxyalkyl radicals include methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl and ethoxyethyl. Typical aralkoxyalkyl radicals include phenylmethoxymethyl. Typical aryloxyalkyl radicals include phenoxyalkyl. Lower alkylthioalkyl radicals include the thio counterparts of the above mentioned lower alkoxyalkyl radicals. Typical heterocyclic radicals include furyl, pyridyl, and thienyl. The term haloalkyl means alkyl C16 radicals substituted by one or more halogen atoms.Typical examples include fluoromethyl, chloromethyl, difluoromethyl, difluoroethyl, bromomethyl, iodomethyl, dichloromethyl, dichloroethyl, and dibromomethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2 trifluoromethyl propyl and chlorofluorinated alkyl radicals. The term cycloalkanylalkyl means alkyl substituted with a cycloalkyl radical. The term fluorinated methyl11 means methyl radicals having one or more fluorine atoms attached thereto including substitution of all hydrogen atoms by fluorine. This term is intended to include methyl radicals wherein one or more hydrogen atoms may be replaced by a chlorine atom, provided that the methyl radical must have one or more fluorine atoms attached to it. Typical examples include fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, and trifluoromethyl radicals, chlorodifluoromethyl, dichlorofluoromethyl, and the like. The term 1,2 dihydropyridine means herein a dihydropyridine having the hydrogen atoms attached to the ring nitrogen and to an adjacent carbon atom, and includes dihydropyridines which would be called 1,6 dihydropyridines in some chemical nomenclature systems. The dihydropyridines of this invention ofFormula 3 or 4 above are obtained by the dehydration of the corresponding dihydroxypiperidines by any suitable dehydration agent, such as, but not limited to, 1 sulfuric acid 2 toluenesulfonic acid or 3 trifluoroacetic anhydride. Typically the dihydroxypiperidines are obtained from the corresponding tetrahydropyrans by treatment with aqueous or gaseous ammonia. To provide the desired dihydroxypiperidine, the appropriate aldehyde is reacted with an appropriate 3 ketoester and a catalytic amount of piperidine in a suitable reaction medium. This reaction provides the tetrahydropyran from which is obtained the piperidine which, in turn, provides the dihydropyridines by dehydration as mentioned above.The preparation is further described the following reaction scheme EMI8.1 When providing the dihydropyridine compounds wherein the 4 position is substituted by either arylmethyl, phenylmethoxymethyl, or heterocyclic radicals wherein the hetero atom is oxygen or sulfur, it is preferred to utilize a catalytic amount of an organic acid as the dehydration agent in place of the usual inorganic acid. Typically, toluenesulfonic acid in a reaction medium of, for example, toluene has been found to be suitable for this purpose. The reaction is generally run at reflux temperature. To provide a major amount of the 3,4 dihydropyridine isomer from the corresponding piperidine, trifluoroacetic anhydride is the preferred dehydration agent. In such process, the reaction medium is typically a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride. Although the above reaction scheme involves several sequential reactions, in accordance with the process of this invention one can prepare the dihydro pyridines in a single reaction mixture. In such a mode of preparation, the reaction product is treated sequentially until the desired product is finally isolated from the reaction mixture as will be further described below. The improved one vessel reaction provides the desired product in higher yield than is possible in the multi step process. In accordance with the novel process of this invention, the appropriate 3 ketoesters represented by the formulaEMI9.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above is first reacted with an aldehyde represented by the formulaEMI9.2 wherein R is defined above. This reaction occurs under atmospheric pressure and generally at a temperature in the range of from about 400C to about 1000C. One may optionally employ an aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or toluene or any suitable solvent for the first reaction. When the reaction of the 3 ketoester and aldehyde is completed, for example, as indicated by NMR analysis, gaseous ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is added through the reaction mixture. If a solvent has not been previously employed it is added prior to the gaseous ammonia.An excess of from about 2 to 10 times the amount of ammonia required for the conversion of the tetrahydropyran is normally employed. After completion of ammonia or ammonium hydroxide addition to the reaction mixture, it is preferred to purge the ammonia from the reaction mixture or drain out excess ammonium hydroxide from the reaction mixture. The purging step is not necessary, but will eliminate the possibility of a reaction of the ammonia with the dehydration agent. The final step of the process is the addition to the reaction mixture of a suitable dehydrating agent whereby the dihydroxypiperidine is converted to the corresponding dihydropyridine. The preferred dehydrating agents in those instances wherein the 4 position of the dihydroxypiperidine is alkyl is sulfuric acid although any suitable dehydrating agent can be used.Sulfuric acid is preferred because it has a greater rate of reaction. Other suitable dehydrating agents are mentioned above. After dehydration of the dihydroxypiperidine to produce the desired dihydropyridine, the product is isolated from the reaction mixture by conventional methods. The 1,2 dihydropyridines of Formula 5 above are prepared by reduction of the correspondinglysubstituted pyridine. The pyridine compounds are formed from the above described 1,4 and 3,4 dihydropyridines either by oxidation using an oxidizing agent such as sodium nitrite in acetic acid or 2,3 dichloro 5,6 dicyano 1,4 benzoquinone, chromic oxide in acetic acid, or the like when the desired pyridine is to have the same number of fluorine atoms on each R2 as in the starting dihydropyridine. When one of the fluorinated methyl groups is to have one fewer fluorine atoms than the R2 in the parent dihydropyridine, the conversion to the pyridine is carried out by dehydrofluorination using an organic base such as l,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene trialkylamine, pyridine, mono , di and tri alkyl substituted pyridine neat or in a suitable solvent at elevated temperature in the range of 65 1600C. To form the 1,2 dihydropyridine compounds of Formula 5, the correspondingly substituted pyridine is reduced. A preferred reducing agent for this reaction is sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent, such as N,N dimethylformamide. Detailed Description of the Invention The usual starting material in the manufacture of the dihydropyridines of this invention of Formula 3 or 4 above is, as shown above, a dihydroxypiperidine 2 . The preferred method for making the aforementioned dihydroxypiperidine involves the reaction of ammonia and the appropriate tetrahydropyran wherein gaseous ammonia is passed through the reaction mixture containing the tetrahydropyran. The dihydroxypiperidine starting material for the preparation of compounds of this invention can be prepared by either the above described preferred process or that of the prior art exemplified by Balicki et al in Polish patent 89,493.

The pre emergent tests are conducted as follows A good grade of top soil is placed in aluminum pans and compacted to a depth of 0.95 to 1.27 cm from the top of the pan.On the top of the soil is placed a predetermined number of seeds or vegetative propagules of various plant species. The soil required to level fill the pans after seeding or adding vegetative propagules is weighed into a pan.A known amount of the active ingredient applied in a solvent or as a wettable powder suspension and the soil are thoroughly mixed, and used as a cover layer for prepared pans. In Table IV below the amount of active ingredient is equal to the rate of 11.2 k ha.After treatment, the pans are moved into a greenhouse bench where they are watered from below as needed to give adequate moisture for germination and growth. Approximately 2 3 weeks after seeding and treating, the plants are observed and the results recorded.

Thus the active ingredient can be used with an adjuvant such as a finely divided solid, a liquid of organic origin, water, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an emulsifying agent, or any suitable combination of these. The compositions of this invention, particularly liquids and wettable powders, may contain as a conditioning agent one or more surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given composition readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorporation of a surface active agent into such compositions normally greatly enhances their efficacy. By the term surface active agent it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, and emulsifying agents are included therein. Anionic, cationic, and non ionic agents can be used with equal facility. Typical wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfosuccinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, ditertiary acetylenic glycols, polyoxyethylene derivatives of alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the mono higher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g., sorbitan . Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium lignin sulfonates, polymeric alkyl, naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, and the polymethylene bisnaphthalene sulfonate. Wettable powders are water dispersible compositions containing one or more active ingredients, an inert solid extender, and one or more wetting and dispersing agents. The inert solid extenders are usually of mineral origin such as the natural clays, diatomaceous earth and synthetic minerals derived from silica and the like. Examples of such extenders include kaolinites, attapulgite clay and synthetic magnesium silicate. The wettable powder compositions of this invention usually contain from 0.5 to 60 parts preferably from 5 20 parts of active ingredient, from about 0.25 to 25 parts preferably 1 15 parts of wetting agent, from about 0.25 to 25 parts preferably 1.0 15 parts of dispersant and from 5 to about 95 parts preferably 5 50 parts of inert solid extender, all parts being by weight of the total compositon.Where required, from about 0.1 to 2.0 parts of the solid inert extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or anti foaming agent or both. Other formulations include dust concentrates comprising from 0.1 to 60 by weight of the active ingredient on a suitable extender these dusts may be diluted for application at concentrations within the range of from about 0.1 10 by weight. Aqueous suspensions or emulsions may be prepared by stirring an aqueous mixture of a waterinsoluble active ingredient and an emulsification agent until uniform and then homogenized to give a stable emulsion of very finely divided particles.The resulting concentrated aqueous suspension is characterized by its extremely small particle size, so that when diluted and sprayed, coverage is very uniform. Suitable concentrations of these formulations contain from about 0.1 60 , preferably 5 50 , by weight of active ingredient, the upper limit being determined by the solubility limit of active ingredient in the solvent. In another form of aqueous suspension, a water immiscible herbicide is encapsulated to form a microencapsulated phase dispersed in an aqueous phase. In one embodiment, minute capsules are formed by bringing together an aqueous phase containing a lignin sulfonate emulsifier and a water immiscible chemical and polymethylene polyphenylisocyanate, dispersing the water immiscible phase in the aqueous phase followed by addition of a polyfunctional amine. The isocyanate and amine compounds react to form a solid urea shell wall around particles of the water immiscible chemical, thus forming microcapsules thereof. Typically, the concentration of the microencapsulated material will range from 480 to 700 g l of total composition, preferably 480 to 600 g l. Concentrates are usually solutions of active ingredient in water immiscible or partially water immiscible solvents together with a surface active agent. Suitable solvents for the active ingredient of this invention include dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, hydrocarbons, and water immiscible ethers, esters or ketones.However, other high strength liquid concentrates may be formulated by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent then diluting, e.g., with kerosene, to spray concentration. The concentrate compositions herein generally contain from about 0.1 to 95 parts preferably 5 60 parts active ingredient, about 0.25 to 50 parts preferably 1 25 parts surface active agent and where required, about 4 to 94 parts solvent, all parts being by weight based on the total weight of emulsifiable oil. Granules are physically stable particulate compositions comprising active ingredient adhering to or distributed through a basic matrix of an inert, finely divided particulate extender. In order to aid leaching of the active ingredient from the particulate, a surface active agent such as those listed hereinbefore can be present in the composition. Natural clays, pyrophyllites, illite, and vermiculite are examples of operable classes of particulate mineral extenders. The preferred extenders are the porous, absorptive, preformed particles such as preformed and screened particulate attapulgite or heat expanded, particulate vermiculite and the finely divided clays such as kaolin clays, hydrated attapulgite or bentonitic clays. These extenders are sprayed or blended with the active ingredient to form the herbicidal granules. The granular compositions of this invention may contain from about 0.1 to about 30 parts by weight of active ingredient per 100 parts by weight of clay and 0 to about 5 parts by weight of surface active agent per 100 parts by weight of particulate clays. The compositions of this invention can also contain other additaments, for example, fertilizers, other herbicides, other pesticides, safeners, and the like used as adjuvants or in combination with any of the above described adjuvants.

Compound of Example No. 13 5.0 Pyrohyllite 20 40 95.0 100.0 When operating in accordance with the present invention, effective amounts of the compounds of this invention are applied to the soil containing the plants, in any convenient fashion.The application of liquid and particulate solid compositions to the soil can be carried out by conventional methods, e.g., power dusters, boom and hand sprayers, and spray dusters. The compositions can also be applied from airplanes as a dust or a spray because of their effectiveness at low dosages. The application of an effective amount of the compounds of this invention to the locus of undesired weeds is essential and critical for the practice of the present invention. The exact amount of active ingredient to be employed is dependent upon various factors, including the plant species and stage of development thereof, the type and condition of soil, the amount of rainfall and the specific compounds employed. In selective preemergence application to the soil a dosage of from 0.1 to about 11.2 kg ha, preferably from about 1.12 to about 5.60 kg ha is usually employed. Lower or higher rates may be required in some instances. One skilled in the art can readily determine from this specification, including the above examples, the optimum rate to be applied in any particular case. The term soil is employed in its broadest sense to be inclusive of all conventional soils as defined in Webster s New International Dictionary,Second Edition, Unabridged 1961 . Thus the term refers to any substance or medium in which vegetation may take root and grow, and includes not only earth, but also compost, manure, muck, humus, sand and the like, adapted to support plant growth. Although the invention is described with respect to specific modifications, the details thereof are not to be construed as limitations except to the extent indicated in the following claims.
