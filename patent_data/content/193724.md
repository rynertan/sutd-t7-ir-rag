# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CALIBRATION OF A TIME MEASURING DEVICE

## Abstract
An apparatus for calibrating a timer of the type having a first and a second input channel in which an initial signal arriving over one input channel initiates a timing cycle, while a subsequent signal arriving over the other input channel terminates the timing cycle, said initial and subse quent signals being transported to remote ends of said first and second input channels from remote sources by means of first and second signal conductors. The apparatus com prises a commoning conductor, a test signal source, and first and second signal routing means, said first signal routing means being capable of selectively coupling the first signal cable, the test signal source, one end of the commoning cable, and the first timer input channel, while said second signal routing means is capable of selectively coupling the second signal cable, the test signal source, or another end of the commoning cable and the second timer input channel. The differences in delay times associated with different signal paths are determined by a series of tests using the test signal source to generate signals to start and stop the timer, while the signal routing means configure the apparatus in selected testing arrangements.
