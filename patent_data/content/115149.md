# Varistor and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A varistor having good voltage current nonlinear charac teristics and a long life performance. The varistor is formed of a sintered body consisting essentially of zinc oxide as a major component, 0.1 to 5 mol of bismuth in terms of Bi₂O₃, 0.1 to 5 mol of cobalt in terms of Co₂O₃, 0.1 to 5 mol of manganese in terms of MnO, 0.1 to 5 mol of antimony in terms of Sb₂O₃, 0.1 to 5 mol of nickel in terms of NiO, and 0.001 to 0.05 mol of aluminum in terms of Aℓ³ .
