# Electrically conductive polyetherester elastomers.

## Abstract
Conductive elastomeric compositions consisting essen tially of a blend of a copolyetherester having 45 85 weight percent of long chains and 15 55 weight percent of short chains and melting at at least 90 C with a conductive filler consisting of carbon black or a mixture of carbon black with graphite, the resistivity of such compositions being less than about 2 ohm.cm can be fabricated or cast into thin, self supporting films or sheets. Articles made from these com positions find utility in electrical and electronic equipment, business machines, and in applications where good aging properties are important.
