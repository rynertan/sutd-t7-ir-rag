# Deflection member and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
Foraminous members 19 useful in making paper webs. The faraminous member of this invention has a macro scopically monplanar, patterned, continuous network sur face 23 which serves to define within the member a plurality of discrete, isolated, deflection conduits 22 . A foraminous woven element 43 , such as a screen, thoroughly coated with liquid photosensitive resin to a controlled depth above the upper surface of the woven element. A mask or a negative having opaque and transpar ent regions which define the pattern is brought into contact with the surface of the liquid photosensitive resin and the resin is exposed to light of an activating wavelength through the mask. The resin exposed to the activating light is hardened cured . Uncured resin is removed from the composite leaving behind the woven element with the solid network formed by the cured resin.
