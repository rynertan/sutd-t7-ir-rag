# Waveform synthesiser for calibrating VOR equipment.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the calibration of VOR equipment by synthesis of a series of waveforms representative of differ ent positions in azimuth. Digital data representative of a frequency modulated component of the VOR waveform is stored in a first memory area 1 and digital data representative of an added sine wave component of the waveform is stored in a second memory area 2 . By appropriate cyclic data retrieval from the memory areas and combination of the data 7 , together with digital to analogue conversion 8 and filtering 10 the VOR waveform corresponding to a particular azimuth may be synthesised.
