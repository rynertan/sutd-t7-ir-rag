# Multi joint arm robot apparatus.

## Abstract
A multi joint arm robot apparatus comprises a multi joint arm in which a plurality of unit arms connected in tandem through joints, driver means arranged in the multi joint arm to drive each of the joints, state detecting means arranged in the multi joint arm to detect states of each of the joints, and a signal processing means for driving the joint driver means to move the multi joint arm on a proper path responsive to the state detecting means. For the purpose of reducing the number of signal transmission lines in the multi joint arm, the signal processing means 21 transmits time division control signals to the state detecting means 24, 25, 26a to 26d, 27a to 27d in each of the joints through a common control signal line 23 arranged in the multi joint arm, and the state detecting means transmit state detecting signals to the signal proces sing means in a time division manner through a data trans mission line 23 arranged in the multi joint arm in response to the time division control signals.
