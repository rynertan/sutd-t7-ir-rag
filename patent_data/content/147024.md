# SHOE INSERT CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A shoe insert for use with a shoe or sneaker to reduce impact to the foot and to absorb shock and attenuate shock to the foot. The insert is comprised of a base layer of a relatively resilient material, a foam layer disposed over the base layer, a fabric disposed over the foam layer and means integrally forming the base layer, foam layer and fabric into a sheet tri laminate. A support layer is disposed only at the heel area and is constructed of a rigid material of higher density than that of the tri laminate. Means are provided for attaching and forming the tri laminate with the support layer.
