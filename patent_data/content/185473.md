# Integrated optoelectronic devices.

## Abstract
Optoelectronic devices are produced as integrated chips which include elements to control optical signals and electronic elements to control the optical elements. An integrated chip includes optical wave guides with tapered ends to facilitate exit and entry of optical signals. The tapered ends are produced by photo electrolytic etch using illumina tion of graded intensity, e.g. the penumbra of a shadow.
