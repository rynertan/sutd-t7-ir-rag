## Description
This invention relates to a single cylinder circular knitting machine having two needle beds or needle carrying structures, for knitting plain and purl stitches. In conventional machines of the above general type, those needles which are knitting plain stitches are movable vertically in the needle cylinder, and those needles which are knitting purl stitches are movable radially in the needle dial overlying the cylinder. ,with small diameter rnachines es primarily employed in knitting stockings,hoYiever, the reduced size of the dial imposes a limitation on the purge of the needles that can be provided in the dial, for otherwise, the needles would end by interfering with one another at the nearest area S o the dial center. To obviate the above limitation, which materially affects the mac nine vereatility, it has been suggested of arranging the needle tricks, or grooved needle seats, in the dial and accordingly the needles themselves rather than radially as usual, at an angle with respect to the radial direction, that is to say tangent to a circle concentrical to the dial. However, even this approach failed to provide satisfactory results. It has been further proposed refer to GermanPatent o. 667,499 of providing the dial with arcuate needle tricks in a pattern that from an essentially radial direction at the outermost edge of the dial is progressivelly deflected upwardly until it follows a substantially parallel direction to the machine axis. In the needle tricks, there are movably arranged respective needle of arcuate configuration which extend over an arc of about 900 and have their hooks and latches located on the concave side. On that same side, the needles are further provided with butts for engagement With tilting jacks, in turn controlled through horizontal sliders being driven by overlying cams. Thus, the needle movements at the outer edge of the dial occur approsimately radially to the dial. The arcuate configuration of the needle tricks enables the provision of a higher number of tricks in the dial, for a given diameter, than with a conventios al dial, sinde the needle tricks are kept at a substantial distance away from the machine central area. This affords the possibility of omitting higE fineness fabrics even with small diameters. However, the arcuate lay of the needle tricks increases the height dimension of the machine with respect to a similar machine equipped with a conventional dial, while the arcuate needle control mechanism is a complex and bulky one, in that it requires several members for each needle and takes up much room even in the horizontal direction, beyond the dial maximum diameter. Attempts have been made at attenuating the complexity of the arcuate needle control mechanism by increasing the needle extension to cover an arc up to about 1800, and by controlling the needles directly through cams arranged to act on needle butts located at the opposite ends thereof to the work ends, as disclosed in German Patent No. 675,210.However, this approach involves an additional increase of the dial height dimension, through the requisite that said height be at least equal to twice the needle radii of curvature. German Patent No. 687,914 discloses a knitting machine including a needle carrying structure which also has an arcuate shape near the needle cylinder.This structure is an upper cylinder with a smaller dia meter than the lower one and outwardly bent at its bottom region to define needle tricks of arcuate configuration. Movable in said tricks are needles which are provided with an elastic shaiik portion adapted to conform itself to the arcuate shape of the respective trick The rernaining portion of the needles is straight and movable in a vertically extending trick of the upper cylinder, it being provided with a butt subjected to the action of cams which surround the cylinder. However, it will be appreciated that the latter machine, besides its complicated construction and the critical operation of its flexible sh√á needles, also exhibits a high vertical dimension of the needle carrying structure positioned above the lower cylinder. This invention sets out to provide a singlecylinder circular knitting machine having two needle beds or needle carrying structures, wherein both needle beds can accommodate an equal number of needles even in the case of small diameter dimensions, without bringing about any increase of the machine overall height dimension beyond that of a conventional cylinder and dial machine having the same diameter, and even affording a reduction of that dimension. Within the above general aim, it is possible to arrange that the dual needle bed single cylinder knitting machine of this invention can also effectively discharge the knitted fabric from above, i.e.in a reversed condition. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a single cylinder circular knitting machine having two needle beds or needle carrying structures arranged one above the other and being each formed with needle tricks, wherein respective needles are slidably accommodated, the lower structure comprising a needle cylinder and the upper structure com prising a needle dial, the needles in both said strut tures being controlled through control means at least in part movable relative to sa id structu ec, the machine being characterized in that said needle dial extends into said needle cylinder and has needle tricks therein of arcuate configuration with the center of curvature being located on the same side as the needle cylinder, in said arcuate needle tricks there being slidably arranged arcuate needles having hooks and latches located on the convex side of the arcuate shape. In a machine thus configured, wherein the needle tricks in the dial and related needles extend from an approximately radial direction of lay at the top end of the respective tricks progressively downwards, while remaining substantially away from the machine central area, it becomes possible to not only arrange in the upper needle carrying structure the same number of tricks which can be formed in the lower needle carrying structure, even in the case of small diameters, but also to reduce the machine overall height for a given set of characteristics, because the control cos for the needles in the upper needle carrying structure are also accommodated substantially within the lower needle carrying structure, and therefore, do not occupy the space volume above it. Since the needles are held substantially away from the center of the machine, the cams controlling such needles are also located sufficiently away from the machine central area, and therefore, pose no problems regarding their configuration and dimensions. The upper needle carrying structure, moreover, may advantageously be of hollow construction, that is open at the central area over its entire height to enable for the first time in a single cylinder machine the product to be pulled and discharged from the top , with all those attendant advantages which are well knovYn to the experts in the art. Further features and advantages of the invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description of some preferred embodiments thereof, given herein by way of example and not of limitation, and being illustrated in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is an axial section through a singlecylinder circular knitting machine according to this invention, illustrating a first embodiment thereof Figure 2 shows an axial section of the knitting machine of Figure 1 on an enlarged scale with respect to that of Figure 1 Figure 3 shows, on an enlarged scale, a needle from the upper needle carrying structure of the knitting machine of the preceding figures Figure 4 is a detail plan view of the machine of Figures 1 and 2 Figure 5 is a fragmentary axial sectional view of a lmlitting machine according to the invention, illustrating another embodiment thereof Figure 6 is an axial sectional view of a knitting machine according to the invention, illestrating a further embodiment thereof and Figure 7 is a detail view of a needle from the upper needle carrying structure of the embodiment shove in Figure 6. With initial reference to Figures 1 and 2, a single cylinder circular knitting machine according to the invention comprises two needle beds or needle carrying structures 1 and 2, which are arranged to extend cm axially above each other, the lower structure 2 comprising a conventional needle cylinder, and the upper structure 1 comprising a novel needle dial which will be described hereinafter. In the cylinder 2, there are formed in a manner known per se needle tricks 3, wherein the needles 4 knitting plain stitches are movable such needles being of conventional design and controlled through jacks 5 being selected by conventional selection devices, not shown. The cylinder 2 is carried rotatably on a stationary or fixed portion 6 of the machine main frame through bearings 7, and is rotatively driven in a manner knovrn per se. Inside its top or upper portion, the cylinder 2 is advantageously provided with a cup like element 8 which is open at the bottom and is adapted to function as fabric guiding element, as will be expla ed hereinafter.Said element 8, however, may be omitted and the cylinder 2 have a smooth configuration throughout its inner portion, similarly to converjtional machines. The reference numeral 9 designates sinkers of conventional design, which are slidably received in a rotating support ring 10 and controlled through a fixed ring 11, the whole assembly being in accordance with well lzno n practices. The numeral 12 designates a yam feed unit comprising yarn feeding fingers 13, of a knov n type. The machine further comprises means for controlling the needles 4 and jacks 5, which means comprise traditional cams controlling the movements of the needles 4 and jacks 5, such cams being not shown in any detail herein because known per Se. In accordance with this invention, the upper needle carrying structure or dial 1 extends into the cylinder 2 and has, formed on a supporting body 14, needle tricks 15 of arcuate shape, their center of curvature being located on the same side as the cylinder 2. Advantageously, the topmost portion of the tricks 15 is substantially tangent to a horizontal plane.In the tricks 15, there are slidable respective needles 16, also of arcuate shape, the radius of curvature of the needles being equal to the radius of the tricks 15. T ne supporting body 14 is carried rotatably in a fixed portion 17 of the machine main frame and has a fixed atructllre 18 overlying it which carries control means for the needles 16, said means comprising control cams 19,20,. ore specifically, in the embodiment shown inFigures 1 and 2, the supporting body 14 comprises a portion 21, which is configured substantially like the top portion. of awineglass rigid has internal tricks 15, a substantially cup like portion 22, made rigid with the wineglass portion 21 and supporting the latter, and a shaft 23, made rigid with the portion 22 and extending out of the cylinder 2 in an upward direction. The portions 21 and 22 have outside diameters such that they define, relatively to the cylinder 2, an interspace 24 for the passage of th knitted fabric 25 therethrough. The shaft 23 is made rigid with a gear wheel 26, which is journalled, through bearings 27, in a sleeve element 28, which is a part of the fixed structure 18 and coaxial with the shaft 23. The sleeve element 28 is fastened, as by means of screws 29, to the fixed portion 17, the top end of the shaft 23 being threaded to receive a nut 30 or the like in threaded engagement thereon, thereby the element 28 practically supports the ole supporting body 14 and keeps it correctly positioned with respect to the fixed structure 18 with the illtermediary of the bearings 31,32 and 33. The gear wheel 26 is rotated by the machine motive means at the same rpm as the cylinder 2, as is usually the case with the dial. The cams 19,20 are attached to the sleeve element 28 and define a passageway 34 therebetween for respective control butts 16a of tile needles 16. The cams 19,20 have a circun erential extension pattern which is eesentially similar to that of the cams controlling the dial needles in a conventional machine, end may be constructed iii the same way as the cams which control the sinkers in a double cylinder knitting machine, witl the eception of the geometry of the passageway 34. Advantageously, the tricks 15 will extend substantially over a slightly larger arc of a circle than 90 degrees, the needles 16 extending over an arc of a circle substantially equal to 90 degrees. The needles 16 are of the latch type and have, as shown more clearly in Figure 3, a hook 16b and latch 16c, which are arranged on the convex side of the arcuate needle, that is upwardly when the needles are installed in the machine. It will be apparent hose, under the influence of the cams 19,20 whose profiles are set in accordance with the machine knitting program, the needles 16 are caused to move along an arc of a circle between a position whereat their hooks 16b and latches 16e move out of the supporting body i4 and specifically out of the wineglass portion 21 , as illustrateo for the left needle 16 in Figures 1 and 2, and a position whereat the hooks and latches are internal to the periphery of the supporting body 14 and specifically of the wineglass portion 21 , as illustrated for the right needle 16 in Figures 1 and 2. It will be also appreciated that the useful movement of the hooks and latches of the needles 16 between said to limit positions does not substantially dosser from conventional practice, it occurring in a substantially horizontal and radial direction at the stitch formation area0Thus,the stitches are also formed in a co.arentional manner,. and will require no further explanation.The knitted fabric 25 is collected gradually inside the cylinder 2, like in a cylinder and dial machine, after passing through the interspace 24, to then continue towards the bottom portion of the cylinder 2. Advantageously, there may be provided a suction .nears to favor the downward movement of the fabric 25, at least along the inter space 24, it being possible for such means to be of a oven type. As may be seen more clearly in Figure 4, which shows a plan view of the wineglass portion 21 and part of the cylinder 2, the tricks 15 extend radially over a short distance only at their top portion, to then become gradually parallel to the rotation axis of the machine and extend at a distance from said axis which is appreciably greater than ir a conventional dial of equal diameter, The short radial extension of the tricks 15 makes it readily possible to arrange the same number of tricks 15 therein as are the tricks 3 of the cylinder, as shown again in Figure 4, even where the machine has a small diameter. This enables the machine 3s3itting fineness Lo be improved considerably, as can the fineness of the resulting knitwork, for a given diameter of the cylinder. Advantageously, the supporting body 14 may be made internally hollow and open at the top, such as to allow the knitted product 25 to be discharged upwardly, that is in a reversed condition, which is known to favor the carrying out of the final or finishing operatics on the knitwork, especially where the latter is a hose or stockings article. To this aim, the shaft 23 may be of hollow construction. However, since with small diameter machines the hollow in said shaft could be insufficient, the embodiment of Figure 5 is provided wherein similar elements to those appearing in the preceding figures carry the same reference numerals, and equivalent elements are identified with the same reference numerals but with a prime . In this embodiment, the shaft 23 is replaced with a bottom flanged sleeve 35, which is made rigid with the centrally open gear wheel 26 and provided with a top thread for the nut 30 .The fixed structure 18 , being carried on the fixed portion 17 , supports the gear wheel 26 through bearings 27 and holds in position the sleeve 35 through bearings 311,321,331. The cams 19 and 20 are rigidly held between the bottom flange of the sleeve 35 and the fixed structure 18 The wineglass portion 21 is attached to the sleeve 35 by means of an annular element 22 which is secured to the sleeve 35. Advantageously, under the flange of the sleeve 35, there is arranged a rounded body 36 adapted for facilitating the guiding and advancing of the fabric 25 in an upward direction. This embodiment comprises a means for favoring the downward movement of the fabric 25 through the interspace 24, e.g. a suction means acting fro. below through the cylinder 2 with the sleeve 35 closed, and a means for conveying and pulling the fabric toward the top upon reaching a given lengsh, said lastmentioned means comprising optionally a suction means operative through the sleeve 35, or tensioning means, e. g. of the same type as used in upward take up double cylinder knitting machines. In the embodiment of Figure 6, wherein similar elements to those shown in Figures 1 and 2 are designated with the same reference nwnerals and the equivalent elements are identified with double primed numerals, the latch needles 16 refer also to Figure 7 have no butts and are each provided with a hooked bottom end 16 a, which is hingedly associated with a hooked top end 37a of a respective linear jack 37. The engagement and configuration of the hooked ends 16 a and 37a are such as to enable the needles 16 to be pushed and pulled by the respective jacks 37. The jacks 37 are each provided with at least one butt 37b, adapted to follow contro . cams √≠9 , 20 , attached to an annular body 38 made rigid with the fixed structure 1 8. The jacks 37 move linearly in respective axial inner grooves or tricks 39 of an annular guiding element 40 clamped between the wine glass portion 21 of the supporting body 14 and the bottom 22 thereof. The wineglass portion 21 is so configured as to leave a sufficient clearance for the rectilinear movement of the selectors 37 between two limit positions, shown again in Figure 6, whereto there correspond, respectively, the limit positions of the needles 16 discussed with reference toFigures 1 and 2. 9 he annular blocks 41,42, defining the control cams for the needles 16 in the preceding embodiments, are now in mutual engagement ald define a continuous guiding surface for guiding the needles 16s. It will be appreciated fro the foregoing that a single cylinder machine according to the invention has, in any of the embodiments described hereinabove, the peculiar capability of combining the typical advantages afforded by single cylinder knitting machines with the advantages typifying the double cylinder machines. The invention as described is susceptible to many modifications and variations, without departing from the purview of the instant inventive concept.Thus, as an example, the machine could be implemented with the cylinder 2 and upper needle carrying structure 1 stationary and rotating cams. Instead of the hooked connection between the needles 15 and jacks 37 a clevis pin system could be provided, e.g.as utilized between the shank and latch of the needles.To avoid a rubbing contact and excessive stresses in the needles 16 , under the pushing force applied by the jacks 37, against the fixed blocks 41 and 42, the latter may be arranged to be rotary. Of course, the upper needle carrying structure of Figure 5 may be implerented with jacks 37 in accordance with the embodiment shove in Figure 6, that is to arrange for upward discharge even in the embodiment providing jacks. It is to be understood that the machine described hereinabove and illustrated in the accompanying drawings may not be set up for hose or stockigs article knitting, and may have larger diaueters, there being no limitations in this respect. Similarly, it is not strictly required that the machine has an equal number of tricks on both its needle carrying structures, and the upper needle carrying structure may have, for example, one half the number of needles provided on the cylinder.
