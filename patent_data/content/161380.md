# A process for producing insulating padding.

## Abstract
This process comprises the steps of mixing fibres, such as polyester or other fibres, with silicone treated fibres of various nature and origin to produce, after carding, a web 1 of mixed fibres which is then treated, on one face, with a mixture 1 of sticky plastic bonding agents and subse quently pressed through a calender 4 having two or more suitably heated cylinders 4 , 4 which reduces the thick ness of the web 1 itself. At the output of the cylinders 4 , 4 of the calender 4 the product 1 remains, for a short time, adhering with its sticky surface to the corresponding cylinder 4 , thus being subjected to a slight expansion process which causes the formation of air pockets 5 .
