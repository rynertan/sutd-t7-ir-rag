## Description
This invention relates to power supply systems for reluctance motors. In particular, the invention relates to power supply systems for two phase reluctance motors. Power circuits previously proposed for and applied to reluctance motor systems for industrial drive applications have, in general, failed to show significant savings over comparable systems for induction or synchronous machines. In at least some such circuits, this has been due to the use of expensive fast switch off devices on both sides of each phase winding. In other arrangements, in which the phase windings have been arranged so that each is exposed to only one half of the rail to rail voltage of the power supply, the resulting reduction in the number of devices has been offset by operational or performance limitations. In US 4,253,053 and WO 83 00957, there is provided an electric power converter circuit for a variable speed switched reluctance motor, in which each of three phase windings is connected in sequence across a DC supply in series with two thyristors, one to each side of the winding. Two commutating diodes are provided for each winding, one enabling the top thyristor to be commutated and the other for commutation of the bottom thyristor. All of the thyristors are indicated as being devices of the same kind, as also are the commutating diodes. It is an object of the present invention to provide an economical power supply circuit for a reluctance motor drive system, in which both the number of switching devices and their cost is substantially minimised. A further objective of the invention is the provision of such a circuit in which the number of fast switch off devices is also substantially minimised. According to the invention, there is provided a power supply system for a reluctance motor having The or each said first switch means may be a GTO thyristor or a transistor. An associated fast turn off diode may be provided for the or each said first switch means for PWM switching. The or each said second switch means may be a slow turn off thyristor and an associated slow diode may be provided for the or each said second switch means to allow one switching action of said slow turn off thyristor for each excitation of the respective phase winding. In a favoured embodiment of power supply system according to the invention for application to a two phase reluctance motor, the system has two said first switch means and two said second switch means, and commutation means for switch off of said second switch means are defined by a capacitor interconnecting the point of connection of each slow turn off thyristor to a respective phase winding of the motor, so that each said slow turn off thyristor is force commutated by energisation of a phase winding other than that which it connects to said other supply rail in its switched on condition. Alternatively the or each said second switch means may be commutated from a further auxiliary rail via a low power thyristor and a transistor. Preferably said power supply system according to the invention has two said first switch means and two said second switch means, for application to a two phase reluctance motor. Each said second device is force commutated by energisation of the other phase winding. A four phase motor may be powered by two two phase power supplies according to the invention operating side by side, while in a still further variant, a single phase power supply incorporating the principles of the invention may also be provided. The disadvantages of certain known power supply circuits in regard to device count and cost are now discussed having regard to Figures 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings and the invention is then described in relation to Figures 6 to 8 of the drawings. In the drawings In Figures 1 to 5, a variety of conventional or known power supply circuits are shown. These are discussed in the following paragraphs, subsequent to which the invention is described and explained having regard to Figures 6 to 8. In Figure 1, a conventional power circuit for an induction motor or synchronous machine is depicted, in which three phase windings 1, 2 and 3 are fed in sequence by switch devices S₁ to S₆, each of which is associated with a respective diode D₁ to D₆. A known power circuit arrangement for a reluctance motor is shown in Figure 2, in which the windings of a four phase machine are connected in pairs across the supply rails and each pair of windings is energised by a respective pair of switches. Thus the rail voltage is split, and each winding is energised or de energised at one half of the full rail voltage. A further known arrangement is shown in Figure 3, for a three phase reluctance machine, in which each phase winding sees the full rail voltage and is switched on and off by a pair of devices interposed respectively between the top or positive rail and the winding and between the winding and the bottom or negative rail. In the known arrangement shown in Figure 4 for a single phase only of a multi phase configuration, the phase winding is energised from a source P by the device S, and a de energising voltage is presented through device D from a sink L. Sink L may alternatively be an auxiliary rail. In the similarly depicted known arrangement of Figure 5, the de energising voltage is presented by a close coupled winding W of reversed sense to the sense of the phase winding . These power circuits and others previously proposed for reluctance motors intended for industrial drive applications have by and large shown no clear savings over the circuits used for induction or synchronous machines, as exemplified by the arrangement of Figure 1, and all of the circuits illustrated in Figures 2 to 5 require substantially the same ratio of device kVA to machine input kW. This latter point may be briefly enlarged upon, and in the following discussion, certain assumptions are made to simplify the argument. First of all, the reactive current which must be fed back into the supply in a practical arrangement, in order to de energise the windings, is neglected. This amounts to neglecting the ratings of feedback diodes. A similar assumption, namely unity power factor, is made for the induction motor, for comparison of induction motor and reluctance motor power circuits on a like basis. Device kVA is here defined as the product of maximum blocking voltage and average current, thus leaving no safety margin. Block inverter operation is also supposed. Machine kW is taken as the product of d.c. rail voltage and the sum of the currents into the top devices, or the product of the d.c. rail voltage and the sum of the currents out of the bottom devices. In Figures 1 to 3, each top switch S blocks the rail voltage only. The combined rating of the top switches therefore equates to the machine kW input. The same is true for the bottom switches. The total required device kVA rating is thus double the machine kW input. In Figures 4 and 5, switch S must block twice the source voltage, for the usual case of exactly reversing the winding voltage during de energisation. Thus again in this case, the required device kVA rating is double the machine kW input. It may be emphasised that the above discussion represents a highly idealised and simplified argument, for the purpose of highlighting the principal problem underlying the present invention. More elaborate treatments of the subject, embracing in addition, the RMS rating of devices, may also be undertaken. Thus so far as the power supply circuit is concerned, the mere substitution of a reluctance motor for a rotating field machine offers no appreciable saving in main switching devices, when circuit arrangements such as the known systems described above are employed. While a lower device count is always advantageous, even though the total device kVA may be unchanged, the advantage gained may in some instances be offset by accompanying disadvantages, either by virtue of operational constraints or additional complexity in control, along with a possible associated cost penalty. Thus the arrangement of Figure 2 may at first sight seem attractive, in that only four main switches are used, but severe constraints on the currents allowable at low speeds are required in order to keep the centre rail in balance. Also all four devices S₁ to S₄ must be capable of switching at the PWM frequency, and the circuit suffers from having no freewheel paths, leading to unacceptably high losses at part speeds. A first embodiment of power supply circuit according to the invention is shown in Figure 6 a . Top and bottom rails are typically supplied by a diode bridge B. Each phase winding is disposed between top and bottom rails and is switched at the bottom by a first device in the form of a GTO transistor. Alternatively a pure transistor may be used instead of the GTO gate turn off thyristor . In association with a first diode D Figure 6 b represents a variant of the configuration of Figure 6 a in which the arrangement is substantially inverted, so that the fast devices GTO Both Figure 6 a and Figure 6 b depict substantially idealised circuit configurations incorporating the essential features of the invention and containing a substantial mimimum of components necessary for carrying it out. Practical embodiments of the circuits may advantageously include reverse connected diodes of relatively low power across each slow device as well as an inductor in series with capacitor C In the alternative embodiment of power supply system according to the invention shown in Figure 7, the top end devices are transistors T The circuits of Figures 6 b and 7 act as step down choppers when the bottom end thyristors T are left conducting, and as step up choppers after thyristors T have been commutated. Thus the phase windings a and b of a reluctance motor, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, may be sequentially excited and de excited, with continuous control of current waveshape. The switch on points and the duration and waveshape of energisation of each device GTO or T The two phase embodiments described above represent especially advantageous implementations of the principles of the invention from the point of view of substantial minimisation of the number of components and the cost of the power supply system. In this regard, the circuit of Figure 7 represents a marginally less advantageous arrangement, in that while capacitor C may be of relatively low value, compared with capacitor C In a three phase arrangement of power supply circuit incorporating the principles of the invention, as shown in Figure 8, which is similar to Figure 7, other than in regard to the number of phases, only three fast switching devices S₁, S₂ and S₃ capable of operating at PWM frequency are required, these being located between the top rail and the phase windings. The three devices T₁, T₂ and T₃ provided at the bottom, between the windings and the bottom rail, may be of slow speed line commutation quality, and thus of low cost. Paths for free wheeling may be established by commutating the S or top devices, but the bottom T devices are not so commutated. The combination of high and low performance devices in a single power supply circuit for a reluctance motor provides an asymmetrical arrangement using one fast switch off device and one slow switch for each phase. This asymmetry is acceptable in such a power circuit, in that unidirectional currents are in question, whereas in rotating field machines, current reversal normally necessitates a symmetrical arrangement and thus two fast switches for each winding. The two phase embodiments described may also be employed in a four phase configuration incorporating two two phase supplies operating together. The two phase embodiments are also especially suited to use in drive systems incorporating reluctance motors such as are disclosed in our co pending patent application EP 86100354.9 entitled Electrical drive systems incorporating variable reluctance motors .
