# TELEVISION LINK

## Abstract
An installation links a large colour television receiver 1 with Teletext facilities to a portable black and white televi sion receiver 2 without Teletext facilities in such a way that the Teletext output can be displayed on the receiver 2 thereby not interrupting the programme on receiver 1 this link is achieved by utilizing pulsed laser light for transmit ting the Teletext information. Connection extends between the output of the Teletext decoder in receiver 1 and a separate digital encoder 3 so that the video signals emerging from the Teletext decoder can be switched from display on receiver 1. The suitably en coded video signals then pass to a laser transmitter 4 which transforms them to a pulsed laser beam which is trans mitted initially along an optical fibre 5 and subsequently along a line of sight path in air to a receiver 6 incorporating an analogue amplifier. Thereafter the signal is passed to a decoder 7 which converts the signals back into a form suit able for display on receiver 2.
