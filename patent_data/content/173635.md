# Load carrying device.

## Abstract
An overload detection and safety arrangement for a load carrying device including a fuse bar of a tensile strength less than the tensile strength of the remainder of the load carrying device laced into the remainder of the device so that normal tensile loads on the device are carried through the fuse bar and safety links of a tensile strength greater than the tensile strength of the fuse bar and at least substantially eq ual to the tensile strength of the remainder of the device, the safety links shunting the fuse bar and laced into such remain der of the device to hold the load when the fuse bar breaks due to overload conditions.
