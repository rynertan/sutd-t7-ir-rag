## Abstract
A developing device for developing a latent electrostatic image for an electrophotographic copying machine includes a cylindrical resilient body such as a fur brush or a roller of sponge for triboelectrically uniformly charging a single com ponent developer of the dry type supplied from a developer storage casing and for coating the developer as a uniform thin layer on a developer carrier such as a developing roller.
