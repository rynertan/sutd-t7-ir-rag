# Substituted quinolinone alkanecarboxylic acids, their preparation, and medicaments containing them.

## Abstract
Quinolinone alkanecarboxyiic acids of the formula I R⁴ and R⁵ are identical or different and denote a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkoxy group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl group, an amino group or a dialkylamino group, the alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or R⁴ and R⁵ together denote a methylenedioxy group bonded to two adjacent ring carbon atoms, and A denotes an alkylene group with 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and esters thereof with alkanols with 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and salts thereof with inorganic and organic bases are new compounds. They display a hyperglycaemic action in warm blooded animals. Processes for the preparation of the new compounds are given.
