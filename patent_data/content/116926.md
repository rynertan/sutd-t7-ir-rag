# Magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
There is provided a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus in which two rotary magnetic heads 10 and 20 are sequentially disposed to face each other in the direction of width of a magnetic tape 4 which is running at a predetermined speed and a video signal is recorded in the direction of width of the tape 4 and this recorded video signal is reproduced therefrom. This apparatus comprises means for detecting the rotational phase of either one of the magnetic heads 10 and 20 means for generating a predetermined clock CP₁ counter means 90 which re ceives both output signals of the rotational phase detecting means and the clock generating means and counts the clock CP₁ on the basis of the head rotational phase signal, thereby successively outputting first, second and third count values N₀, N₁ and N₀ means 92 for setting the second count value N₁ so that the continuous first and second count values N₀ N₁ of the counter means 90 is substantially equal to the value of which the frequency of the clock CP₁ was divided by the frequency which is equal to twice the rotating speed of the magnetic heads 10 and 20 and signal producing cirucit means which receives the count value output of the counter means 90 and produces a head switching signal Q₃ for sequencing the video signal to be recorded reproduced by the magnetic heads 10 and 20 into one sequence signal. The above signal producing means includes a circuit for outputting the head switching signal Q₃ which is at a first level in the interval when the counter means 90 is continuously counting the second and third count values N₁ N₀ and is at a second level in the other intervals on the basis of the first and third count values N₀, N₀ of the counter means 90 .
