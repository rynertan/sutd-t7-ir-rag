# A thermoelectric generator for converting heat energy to electrical energy.

## Abstract
A thermoelectric generator device which converts heat energy to electrical energy comprises a first reaction zone, a second reaction zone, a solid electrolyte separator 2 which separates said first and second zones elemental alkali metal 7 within said first zone, an electrode 3 within said second zone and in electricalcontact with the solid electrolyte 2 , a heater 6 and a return line 14 for returning condensed elemental alkali metal from the second reaction zone to the first reaction zone. The improvement comprises that at least a portion 14a of the return line 14 is located within said second reaction zone so that said portion 14a of the return line receives sufficient heat from the heat source to maintain alkali metal within said portion of the return line at a temperature above the melting point of alkali metal.
