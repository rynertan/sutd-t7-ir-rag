# Process for the transfer of refrigeration.

## Abstract
In a process for the transfer of refrigeration from a source of liquid cryogen to a heat load via an intermediary fluid comprising the following steps a introducint the liquid cryogen from its source into the tube side of a shell and tube heat exchanger b passing the intermediary fluid through the shell side of the shell and tube heat exchanger referred to in step a and c passing the intermediary fluid from step b to heat exchange means, which is in a heat transfer relationship with the heat load, the improvement comprising i maintaining the intermediary fluid in a closed loop, a portion of which loop is the shell side of the shell and tube heat exchanger referred to in step a and another portion of which loop is a passage in the heat exchange means re ferred to in step c and ii circulating the intermediary fluid through the closed loop wherein A there is provided in the closed loop, in addition to the intermediary fluid, a gas, which is essentially inert to, and essentially insoluble in, the intermediary fluid, said gas being present in such an amount that the pressure in the closed loop can be maintained in the range of about 1 to about 2 atmospheres at the operating temperature thereof,. B the intermediary fluid is a liquid of such viscosity that it is capable of being circulated through the closed loop at the operating temperature and pressure thereof and C the closed loop has a total volume calculated in ac cordance with the following formula volume B 1 CA D C 1 A wherein
