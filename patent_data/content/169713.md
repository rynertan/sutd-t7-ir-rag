# DUPLEX COMMUNICATIONS

## Abstract
A system for providing duplex communications between two stations 2,4 is established by means of a voice encoder 12 which is capable of operating at distinct bit rates in dependence on whether or not there is an input voice signal to the voice encoder 12 and whether there is a received voice signal from the other station. The bit rate of the voice encoder 12 is controlled by a control unit 22 including a voice controlled switch. The control unit 22 outputs control data which is transmitted at a low bit rate to the other station. When only one party is speaking that party is allocated most of the channel bandwidth, until he is interrupted by the other party, in which case the channel bandwidth is equally divided between them until the first party stops talking when the other party is allocated most of the bandwidth available.
