# Powder for use in dry sensitization for electroless metal deposition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a powder for use in dry sensitization for electroless metallization. The power com prises finely powdered particles of a plastic material and 0.1 to 10 weight of a sensitizing compound and 0.01 to 10 weight of a surfactant. Upon melting down of the powder on a substrate a well defined metallization edge results after subsequent electroless metallization.
