As used herein the term alkyl refers to straight, branched or cyclic lower alkyl groups1 preferably having from 1 4 carbon atoms. Such alkyl groups may themselves be optionally substituted, for instance with halogen atoms. As used herein the term acyl refers to the residues of carboxylic acids, such as lower alkylcarboxylic acids, and benzoic acid. Particular examples of groups R include phenyl, pyridyl naphthalenyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl and indolyl groups and partially or fully saturated analogues thereof. Preferably R is located ortho to the imidazolinylamino group.PreferablyEMI5.1 is located para to the imidazolinylamino group. A particularly preferred group of compounds within formula I are those having the formula IA EMI5.2 wherein RÚ, Rê, R , R4, R5 and R6 are as defined above and acid addition salts thereof. Suitable acid addition salts include salts of the following acids hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric and pamoic acids. Compounds of formula I inhibit intestinal secretion and are therefore useful in the treatment of enterotoxin induced diarrhoea, such as in E.coli scours in livestockE.coli and related diarrhoeas in humans. Compounds of formula I also have 4 agonist activity and or antihypertensive, vasocontricting and sedative activity. According to the present invention there is also provided a process for producing a compound of formula I which process comprises a reacting a compound of formula II EMI6.1 wherein R7 is alkyl, CH2 nR or hydrogen with a compound of formula III R8 x III wherein R8 is CH2 nR when R7 is alkyl or hydrogen or R8 is alkyl when R7 is CH2 nR and X is a reactive leaving group b reacting a compound of formula IV EMI7.1 wherein RÚ, Rê, R , R4 and n are as defined with respect to formula I wherein each group R9is selected from hydrogen and C1 4 alkyl, with a compound of formula V . H2N CH2 CH2 NHR10 V wherein R10 is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl, or c reacting a compound of formula VI EMI7.2 EMI7.3 wherein R11 R21 R3 and R6 are as defined with respect to formula I with a compound of formula VII EMI8.1 wherein R11 and R12 together form an oxo group R13 is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, or acyl and R14 is hydrogen or R12 and R14 together form a bond and R11 is C1 4 alkylthio or benzylthio and R13 is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl or d reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI8.2 with a compound of formula IX EMI8.3 wherein m is 0,1 or 2 and z is hydrogen, halogen orEMI9.1 and R is hydrogen, alkyl, or CH2 m R3 and thereafter reducing the product to the requisite compound of formula I and optionally e , forming a salt of the compound of formula I . In the above processes it may be advantageous to protect the nitrogen atoms not involved in the desired reaction. Such protection may be effected by conventional means and the protecting groups may be removed conventionally. In process a X is conveniently a halogen atom, especially chlorine or bromine or an O tosyl or O mesyl group but other conventional leaving groups may be employed. Process b may be conducted according to the process described in UK Patent No. 1,229,995 whenY isEMI10.1 according to the process described in Netherlands Patent No.6,411,516 Chem. Abs. 63 P18102 g when Y isEMI10.2 according to the process described in Chem. Abs., 85,P94364b whenY isEMI10.3 and according to the process described in Chem. Abs., 85,P5633Y isEMI10.4 Process c may be conducted according to the process described in German Offenlegungschrift 2,505,297 orNetherlands Patent No. 7,404,472 when R11 and R12 together form an oxo group, and according to the process described in Chem. Abs., 84, P59465t when R14 and R12 together form a bond. Process d may be conducted for instance by reacting the compound of formula VIII with an aldelyde and reducing the product with a complex hydride reducing agent such as cyanoborohydride. Alternatively the process can be effected by acylation of the amino group followed by conventional reduction using, for instance, diboranedimethylsulphide complex or using lithium aluminium hydride. Such process as described in B Rouot and G LeClerc, Bull.Soc Chim.Fr., 520, 1979 D Atlas and S L Sabol, Biochein. and Biohys. Res. Comm. 94, 924, 1980 C V Wilson and J F Stenberg, Orq. Syn. Coll. Vol.4, 564, 1963 Compounds of formula II may be produced by processes analogous to those described above. Alternatively compounds of formula II may be produced by reducing the corresponding compound having a nitro substituent on the phenyl group to provide the required amino substituent. Compounds of formula IIA EMI11.1 wherein RÚ, Rê, R5 and R6 are as defined with respect to formula I and the amino group is at one of the meta positions with respect to the imidazolinylamino group, are novel and form a further aspect of the present invention. Such compounds are useful as intermediates in the production of compounds of formula I . They also have a sedative activity in their own right and are accordingly useful in human and veterinary medicine. Compounds of formula IIA are generically disclosed in European Patent Application No. 0 035 393 as having anovulatory activity. However that Patent Application, whilst mentioning aminophenyliminoimidazolines does not give any indication of which position on the phenyl ring is occupied by the amino substituent. Accordingly there is no specific disclosure of the compounds of formula IIA and these are, therefore, novel. Compounds of formula IIA may be produced by processes described above under b and c in relation to the production of compounds of formula I but using appropriate starting materials of formulae IV or VI wherein the group NR4 CH2 n R is replaced by NH2, or a protected derivative thereof or by reducing the corresponding compouund having a nitro group in place of the amino group by conventional chemical or catalytic processes. Compounds of formula IIA and their acid addition salts may be produced according to the processes described generally with respect to production of compounds of formula II above. The starting materials described above may be produced by standard methods as may acid addition salts of compounds of formulae I and IIA . The present invention further provides a compound of formula I or a compound of formula IZA for use in human or veterinary medicine. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of formula IIA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. As used herein the term pharmaceutical composition includes compositions suitable for human and or animal use and pharmaceutically acceptable includes veterinarily acceptable. Pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of formulae I and IIA will, of course, be adapted for administration to the humans or animals to be treated. Thus, for example, the composition may be a shaped composition, such as a bolus, tablet or capsule. In such cases the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier will be chosen from the usual range of lubricants, dispersants, binders, fillers and the like. When these shaped compositions are for administration to cattle and pigs often they will weigh at least 1 g, on occasions at least 2 g. For administration to humans, especially children, the drug may suitably be presented as a syrup including suitable colouring and or flavouring agents. Such syrups are conveniently presented in unit or multi dose containers. For veterinary use the composition may also be a dispersion or a solution of a compound of formula I or formula ilA , hereinafter referred to as the drug in a suitable vehicle for use with an oral doser this is a well known item of farm equipment, basically comprising a liquid reservoir, a mouthpiece adapted for insertion into animal mouths, and a pump mechanism whereby unit doses can be ejected from the reservoir through the mouthpiece .Conveniently the drug may be administered from an oral doser as an aqueous solution. Alternatively the vehicle will be an oil or water based cream to ensure homogeneity of the unit doses administered. The invention, therefore, also provides an oral doser containing a multi dose of the drug in a veterinarily acceptable vehicle. The drugs of the invention may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. Thus the invention also provides animal feed or animal drinking water containing a compound of formula I or IIA . It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinking water compositions with a multi dose of the drug so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the drug along with its diet.It will also be convenient to present the composition of the invention as re mixes for addition to the feed or drinking water. With human babies or young animals, a particularly useful technique is to blend their milk with the drugs of this invention. The compositions of the invention may also be formulated for injection. In such cases the drug chosen is suitably dissolved in water for injection. Often it will be appropriate to include in the compositions a further medicine such as an antibacterial agent for example an antibiotic such as amoxycillin or neomycin or a sulphonamide such as sulfadoxin. Treatment of diarrhoea and scours using a compound of formula I may be supplemented by oral rehydration therapy such as that described in U.K. Patent No.1 581 826, German Offenlegungsschrift No. 28 54 281 andUS Patent No. 4 164 568. Conveniently the compound of formula I may be administered with the oral rehydration formulation. Alternatively it may be provided separately and administered simultaneously or sequentially with the oral rehydration formulation. Accordingly the present invention provides, in a particular aspect, a formllaticn for treating diarrhoea which comprises an effective non toxic amount of a found of formula I as hereinbefore defined and an oral rehydration composition comprising a pharmacologically acceptable aqueous solution contain at least 0.5 wftr of an actively absorbed manosacdBride, at least 25 mM sodium ions and having an osmolarity less than 500 m Osmolar. Preferably the oral rehydration coMposition further comprises actively absorbed amino acids and electrolytes. Active absorption or active transport is well known to the skilled man, as are the monosaccharides and amino acids which are actively absorbed. In this regard the reader is referred to standard text books such as Medicinal Physiology by Guyton published by W.B.Saunders and Company 4th Edition pages 769 to 771.Of course whether or not a particular monosaccharide or amino acid is actively absorbed may also readily be determined by experiment as for example described in WilsonT.H. 1962 Intestinal Absorption Saunders, Philadelphia . To be actively absorbed, monsaccharides must have a at least six carbon atoms in their chain b a D pyranose ring structure and c an intact hydroxyl group at carbon 2. Thus suitable examples of mono saccharides for use in this invention include the naturally occur ring D pyranoses such as glucose and galactose. Other examples of suitable monosaccharides include naturally occurring D pyranoses that have been chemically modified whilst retaining the necessary structural features a , b and c . Examples of such modified monosaccharides include C2 7 acylated and C1 4 alkylated derivatives, such as acetyl, methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl derivatives. Specific examples include alpha methyl glucoside, 3 0 methyl glucose and 6 deoxygalactose. Preferably the tnonosaccharide will be glucose or calactose. The monosaccharide of choice for use in this invention is glucose e. g. dextrose . Suitably the actively absorbed monosaccharide will account for 40 to 80 of the composition, more suitably 50 to 75 for example 60 to 75 of the composition. Often the monosaccharide will represent at least 65 of the composition. Suitable examples of actively absorbed naturally occurring amino acids include neutral amino acids such as glycine and alanine and basic amino acids such as arginine. Preferably the amino acid is glycine. Suitably the amino acid will account for 7.5 to 30E of the composition, preferably 7.5 to 20 , for example 8 to 15 and especially 8 to 12 of the composition. Suitable electolytes for such inclusion include salts containing ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate, gluconate, sulphate, bicarbonate, carbonate and the like. Other favoured electrolytes for inclusion in the compositions include potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, tripotassium phosphate, potassium chloride and the like, with potassium dihydrogen phosphate being particularly suitable. One particularly preferred electolyte for inclusion in the composition of the invention is sodium chloride. Suitably the oral rehydration formulation comprises 10 to 25 electrolytes. Preferably, when sodium chloride is used as electrolyte, it will account for from 7 to 20 of the formulation, for example 10 to 16 of the formulation. The oral rehydration composition may optionally contain citric acid and or a salt thereof, representing from 0.5 to 10 of the composition. Suitably 0.5 to 5 , preferably 0.5 to 2 , for example 0.6 to 1.2 of the composition. Often the composition will contain both citric acid and a salt thereof, but the combined amount will not exceed 10 of the composition. Suitable salts of citric acid include sodium and potassium salts such as mono , di, or tri sodium or mono , di or tri potassium citrate. Often the composition will include 0.1 to 5 of a salt of citric acid, more suitably 0.1 to 0.5 of such a salt. The improved oral rehydration formulation may be presented as a dry powder for dissolution in water or a concentrate for dilution in water. Alternatively the formulation may be an orally administrable solution in water, in which case the solution contains at least 0.5 w v of the monosaccharide and at least 25 mM sodium ions and has an osmolarity of less than 500 m Osmolar.Preferably the formulation also comprises an actively absorbed amino acid and electrolyes. Most preferably the formulation comprises a compound of formula I and an oral rehydration formulation as described in U.K. Patent No. 1 581 826 and U.K. PatentApplication No. 2 012 163 A, U.S. Patent No. 3 898 328 orNalin, D.R. Cash, R.A., Bull World Health Org, 43, 361, 1970 and French Patent No. 2 467 599, which disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. Advantageously the improved formulation includes a preservative or antioxidant such as ascorbate anions or sodium metabisulphite. When presented in solution the formulation would preferably comprise about 6mM ascorbate or up to 0.1 w v sodium metabisulphite. Advantageously the formulation, when presented as a dry powder, is packaged to exclude air and moisture. Preferably such compositions contain glucose as the monosaccharide and glycine as the amino acid. Thus a particularly preferred composition of the a compound of formula I , invention comprises 60 to 70 glucose, 8 to 15 glycine, 0.5 to 2 citric acid, 0.1 to 0.5 of a salt of citric acid, and 10 to 16 sodium chloride. Such compositions often include 5 to 10 of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. A second suitable veterinary composition comprises 40 to 80 of an actively absorbed monosaccharide, 7.5 to 13 of an actively absorbed naturally occurring amino acid, and 0.5 to 10 of a citrate salt. The citrate salt represents 0.5 to 10 of this composition. More suitably the salt will represent 0.5 to 5 , preferably 0.5 to 2 , for example 0.6 to 1.2 of the composition. Suitable examples of citrate salts include sodium or potassium salts such as mono , di or tri sodium, or mono , di or tri potassium citrate. Thus a particularly preferred composition of the a compound of formula I , invention comprises 60 to 75 glucose, 8 to 128 glycine, 0.5 to 2 of a salt of citric acid, and 10 to 16 sodium chloride. Such compositions often include 5 to 10 of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. These compositions suitably contain at least 65 monosaccharide. If desired the compositions of this invention can contain other substances such as vitamins, minerals, buffers, excipients or the like in conventional manner. In general the compositions of this invention will be in the form of dry powder for example one which is readily soluble in water. However in an alternative aspect the compositions of this invention will comprise an aqueous solution containing dissolved therein the previously defined solutes in the previously defined relative proportions. The powders of this invention may be prepared by mixing together the individual components in conventional manner. Once mixed the composition may be put into sachets or other conventional containers. It is frequently advantageous to separate the monosaccharide component from the other components of the composition. This can be effected by using double sachets or other double containers. In such cases components other than the monosaccharide can be mixed and filled into one half of the double sachet and the monosaccharide can be filled into the other half of the double sachet. In such form the compositions of the invention have been found to be particularly stable.The compound of formula I may be included in either sachet. The composition of the invention will normally be administered to the diarrhoeic animal in the form of an aqueous solution, by the oral route. Such solutions may for example contain 20 to 45g. litre of the composition, suitably 25 to 35b. litre, for example 30g. litre. In general calves will be administered from 2 to at least 4 litres per day of such solutions while piglets will normally be administered from a quarter to a one litre per day. The solutions may be administered ad libitum or in two to four or more equal doses per day or by any other similar conventional regime. It will be realised that in the treatment of severely scouring animals anti bacterial agents may be administered in conjunction with the compositions of the invention.Examples of suitable anti bacterial agents for such use include ampicillin, amoxycillin and tetracyclines. The skilled man will realise that the effective absorption properties found with the liquid compositions of the invention will enable them to be used with advantage whenever liquid absorption by animals is a problem. For example the compositions may be used in treating the general dehydration found in post operative conditions in animals such as dogs and cats. They may also be administered with advantage to stressed animals, such as recently purchased calves and the like. It is however believed that the compositions of the invention will be of the greatest use in the treatment of diarrhoea in calves. The amount of drug administered must, of course, be sufficient to bring about the desired effect. This will depend on the effect desired1 for instance, different dosages may be required for treatment of diarrhoea and for sedation as well as on the body weight of the recipient and the chosen route of administration, Thus, by way of example, useful dosage units of the composition for treating diarrhoea may contain 1 pg to 50 mg of the drug, more suitably 20 Ug to 20 mg. Of course, it will be appreciated that many preferred compositions of the invention are in multi dose form as, for the therapy of animals it is often most desirable to be able rapidly to treat a number of animals. Such multi dose compositions will contain, by way of example, at least 1 mg of the drug.Depending on the exact nature of the said multi dose composition, often it will contain at least 50 mg of the drug, and on occasions as much as 1 g. Doses may be administered once or several times daily. The present invention further provides a method for treating humans and animals, which method comprises adminstering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or of formula IIA to the sufferer. Such treatment may be sedation, vasoconstriction, or a treatment for diarrhoea or hypertension. In a particular aspect the method of treatment comprises the administration of a pharmaceutical composition of a compound of formula I or of formula IIA , as hereinbefore described. The present invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples which are not intended to limit the invention in any way.

Control animals receive drug vehicle 45 mins prior to challenge with a similar amount of culture filtrate. The compounds are administered orally. Animals are killed two hours later and the entire intestine removed.The ratio of gut weight to remaining bodyweight GW BW is determined from each animal and the increase in this ratio is determined by substracting 0.06 GW BW for untreated mice from the GW BW of the animal. Drug treated animals are compared with untreated controls. If the compound has had an effect in inhibiting the fluid secretion caused by the enterotoxin s present in the culture filtrate then the gut weight bodyweight ratio should be reduced in the treated animals.The percentage fluid inhibition is determined from the formula EMI48.1 tb Me SEP SEP SEP SEP an SEP SEP increase SEP in SEP GW BW SEP ratio SEP in SEP treated SEP animals tb 100 SEP Mean SEP increase SEP in SEP GW BW SEP ratio SEP in SEP control SEP animals SEP x SEP 100 tb Results are given in table 1 ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS IN ST CHALLENGED MICE TABLE 1EMI49.1 tb Compound SEP Described SEP Dose SEP level SEP SEP Inhibition SEP Significance tb in SEP Example SEP No. SEP Salt SEP mg K SEP p.o.
