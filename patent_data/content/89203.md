# Charge coupled device cameras.

## Abstract
A charge coupled device camera with a smear reducer circuit includes a charge coupled device 20 for generating a pick up signal, a memory 6 for storing a smear signal derived from the pick up signal, and a level selector circuit 10 for eliminating a noise component contained in a smear signal of less than a predetermined level derived from the memory 6 . The output of the level selector circuit 10 is subtracted from the pick up signal thereby to obtain a pick up signal with the smear reduced and the noise component suppressed.
