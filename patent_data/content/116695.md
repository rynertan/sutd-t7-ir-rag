# An emergency service brake actuator.

## Abstract
An improved emergency and service brake actuator for a wedge type brake is of the type which includes a tubular structure 22 extending from the brake 10 and housing an extended end of a stem 26 of the wedge 12 of the brake therein. An emergency brake actuation portion 18 is mounted on the tubular structure 22 and includes an emergency actuation rod 40 extending into the tubular structure 22 . The emergency brake actuation portion 18 is capable of producing axial movement of the emergency actuation rod 40 to cause an end thereof within an interior of the tubular structure 22 to be selectively located at one of a first position toward the brake for emergency actuation of the brake and a second position remote from the brake. The improvement includes a service cylinder 50 mounted on end of the emergency actuation rod 40 within the interior of the tubular structure 22 and capable of being axially moved therein. A service piston 56 is mounted on the extended end of the stem 26 for sealed movement within the service cylinder 50 . Service hydraulic fluid is introduced to and discharged from the interior of the service cylinder 50 to act on the service piston 56 to produce relative movement therebetween when the emergency actuation rod 40 is in the second position.
