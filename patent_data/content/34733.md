# Method for treating a tube of a zirconium based alloy when applying a protective layer.

## Abstract
The internal surface of a tube 8 of a zirconium based alloy is treated with an activating solution in the form of an aqueous solution containing 1 3 grams litre hydrogen fluoride, 2 8 grams litre ammonium fluoride and 0.1 0.5 grams litre sulphuric acid, in which the amounts of hydrogen fluoride and ammonium fluoride are also adapted so that the amount of ammonium fluoride, calculated in moles, exceeds the amount of hydrogen fluoride, calculated in moles, by at least 5 per cent before a layer of copper and a layer of zir conium dioxide, between the copper layer and the tube 8 , are applied onto the tube 8 .
