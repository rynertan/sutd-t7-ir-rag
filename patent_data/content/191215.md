## Description
This invention relates to a novel optical information recording medium and the recording of information thereon. More particularly, the present invention relates to an information recording medium, preferably in the form of a disk or in a tape format, suitable for use with optical recording and playback apparatus, with the information layer of the recording medium comprising a chromophore. In particular, the chromophore is substituted with an organic substituent conferring film forming properties. Optical recording methods in which light from a laser is focused upon the surface of a recording medium with sufficient intensity to cause a detectable change in the physical characteristics of the surface material have been proposed. Among these methods is the establishment of an information pattern of pits. In such methods, the information representative pattern of pits may be formed in the surface of the recording medium by suitably controlling the intensity of the focused light in accordance with the information to be recorded while relative motion is established between the recording medium and the focused light spot. For instance, in recent years, attention has been increasingly paid to the information recording method in which information is written in a thin film of metal or the like formed on a substrate by using a laser ray or beam. According to such a method, the information recording has been accomplished by forming holes or recesses in the metallic thin film under the action of an energy beam such as a laser ray. The recording medium, of course, is one of the key elements in any optical information storage system. The commercial viability of the recording medium depends upon such technical parameters as the sharpness in recording and playback of the information, i.e., a high signal to noise ratio. Dyes and pigments have accordingly been employed in information layers, often to enhance the sensitivity of the recording layers at the particular wavelength of the laser being used, which results in a much sharper recording and playback of the information. For example, Spong, U.S. Patent No. 4,097,895, describes a recording medium which comprises a light reflecting material, such as aluminum or gold, coated with a dye containing light absorbing layer, such as fluorescein, which is operative with an argon laser light source. The thickness of the light absorbing layer is chosen so that the structure has minimum reflectivity. An incident light beam then ablates, vaporizes or melts the dye containing light absorbing layer, leaving a hole and exposing the light reflecting layer. After recording at the wavelength of the recording light, maximum contrast between the minimum reflectance of the light absorbing layer and the reflectance of the light reflecting layer exists. Carlson, in U.S. Patent No. 3,475,760, discloses a system for directly recording information in a thermoplastic film as a deformation by using a high energy laser scanning beam of small diameter. It is further disclosed that the sensitivity of the films for laser film deformation recording can be enhanced by the addition of pigments or dyes which exhibit a high absorption at the laser wavelength. Erasure of the film deformation is accomplished by recording over the information to be erased using a similar laser beam but with a much smaller scan line spacing, preferably so as to provide overlap of the scan lines. Other U.S. patents which disclose the use of a light absorbing dye in the recording layer include U.S. Patent Nos. 4,412,231 and 4,446,223. The former patent discloses using a mixture of dyes having different light absorbing wavelengths so that the resulting recording layer has a light absorptivity of 80 or more at all the wavelengths in the range of from 400 900 nm. The latter patent discloses an optical information recording element comprising a support coated with a layer of an amorphous composition, which composition comprises a binder and an oxoindolizine or oxoindolizinium dye. In a paper entitled Single Wavelength Optical Recording in Pure, Solvent Coated Infrared Dye Layers by Gravesteijn, Steenbergen and van der Veen, experiments on the use of certain dyes for optical recording for digital and video applications at GaAlAs laser wavelengths are reported. The paper was presented at the Proceeding of the SPIE, Optical Storage Media , volume 420, June 6 10, 1983. The specific dyes discussed in the paper are squarylium dyes and pentamethine dyes. It is further suggested in the paper that the solubility of the squarylium dyes in organic solvents can be greatly increased by the introduction of t butyl groups into thiopyrylium end groups. The use of dyes in conjunction with optical recording media comprising a styrene oligomer is disclosed in the article by Kuroiwa et al appearing in the Thus, while dyes or pigments have been employed in the information storage layers of optical recording media due to their excellent absorption properties, problems are encountered with regard to the application of the dyes or pigments as a stable layer. The addition of dyes to film forming polymers due to limited solubility of the dye in the polymer and the tendency of the dye polymer mixture to phase separate over time, as noted above, are severe problems which need to be overcome. The search for an improved information storage medium comprising a dye or pigment overcoming the aforementioned problems is continuously ongoing. What is desired is a recording layer material which of course exhibits a high extinction coefficient, but which also exhibits excellent film forming properties to enhance its coating applicability, and good solubility in solvents for ease of manipulation. A recording medium which further eliminates the problem of phase separation over time would also be most desirable. Excellent stability with respect to thermal actinic and oxidative degradation is also a desirable feature. Accordingly, it is a major object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved recording medium which comprises a chromophore in the information layer. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a novel optical recording medium which allows for ready application of the chromophore layer to form a stable information layer, while still exhibiting excellent absorption properties. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a novel recording medium which contains a chromophore in the information layer, yet for which the problem of phase separation over time frequently encountered in dye polymer mixtures is eliminated. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a one component material for use in an information layer of an optical recording medium which exhibits excellent film forming and thermomechanical properties, and excellent absorption properties. These and other objects, as well as the scope, nature and utilization of the invention, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and the appended claims. In accordance with the foregoing objectives, provided hereby is a medium for storage of optical information, i.e., information recorded and played back by optical means, which medium comprises an aza annulene chromophore containing a central hetero atom or two hydrogen atoms or isotopes of hydrogen, which chromophore is substituted with at least one, but preferably more than one, moiety or substituent conferring film forming properties. Specifically, the film conferring substituent is that of a monomer or an oligomer, most preferably comprising acid, amide or ester units. The oligomeric substituents may have 2 100 monomeric units. It is also preferred that the aza annulene chromophore is a naphthalocyanine. Silicon is the most preferred central hetero atom. In a most preferred embodiment, the medium for storage of optical information is in the form of a disk. In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a readable information device comprising a relatively thick and thermally stable substrate and having coated thereon a layer comprising an information track comprised of a succession of spaced pits, said layer being comprised of an aza annulene chromophore containing a central hetero atom, which chromophore is substituted with at least one monomeric substituent, or oligomeric substituent containing 2 100 monomer units, said substituent conferring film forming properties to the aza annulene chromophore. In another embodiment there is provided by the present invention an erasable information device comprising a relatively thick and thermally stable substrate having coated thereon a layer comprised of an aza annulene chromophore containing a central hetero atom or two central hydrogen atoms or isotopes of hydrogen, which chromophore is substituted with at least one monomeric substituent, or oligomeric substituent containing 2 100 monomer units, said substituent conferring film forming properties to the aza annulene chromophore. The chromophore compound of which the information layer of the recording medium is comprised is an organo macrocyclic chromophore containing a central hetero atom or two hydrogen atoms or isotopes of hydrogen, which chromophore is substituted with at least one, but preferably more than one, organic substituent conferring film forming properties. For purposes of the present invention, the organic substituent can also include silicon. It is the combination of the chromophore and its organic substituents from which the film forming properties arise. Such a one component material allows one to realize the excellent absorption properties of the chromophore, e.g., high extinction coefficient, while also realizing the benefits of the thermomechanical properties of a film forming material as a result of the film forming properties arising from the combination of the chromophore with the organic substituent. As well, since a single component material is used, the problem of dye polymer phase separation is avoided. The result is an information layer exhibiting an excellent combination of absorption and thermomechanical properties while allowing one to easily apply the material as a film. The one component material of the information layer thereby comprises two portions, i.e., the chromophore portion and the film conferring organic substituents to the chromophore. The chromophore portion, i.e., the primary absorbing portion, of the one component material preferably comprises at least 25 by weight of the material. Functionally, of course, the lower limit of the amount of the chromophore portion is determined by the suitable optical absorption properties of the material as provided by the chromophore portion. The upper limit of the amount of chromophore portion suitable is determined by the desired thermomechanical properties exhibited by the material. The film conferring organic substituent of the chromophore which confers the desired thermomechanical properties to the one component material is a monomer or an oligomer, i.e., having from 2 100 monomer units, depending upon the molecular weight of the monomers chosen. In general, any precursor to a film forming material may be suitable. The most preferred organic substituents, however, are comprised of ether, acid, amide, sulfonamide, ester, acrylate, epoxy, urethane, or silicone units, or mixtures thereof. The most preferred substituents are comprised of acid, amide, or ester units. As noted above, for the purposes of the present invention, the organic substituent can also include silicon. The film conferring organic substituents of the chromophore can be substituted at a central hetero atom or any of the aromatic rings of the chromophore. When the chromophore is substituted by the film conferring organic substituent at a central hetero atom, it is preferred that the hetero atom be Si, Ge, Sn, a transition metal, Al, Ga or In. When the chromophore is substituted by the film conferring organic substituent at an aromatic ring, it is preferred that the hetero atom is an element of Group IIa, IIIb or IVb of the Periodic Table see, F.A. Cotton and G. Wilkinson, When the chromophore comprises two central hydrogen atoms or isotopes of hydrogen, of course, no substitution is possible at the central position of the chromophore. The isotopes of hydrogen would include deuterium and tritium. Chromophores having central hydrogen atoms are manufactured by first making the compound but with a central metal atom which is easily displaced. The metal is then replaced with the hydrogen atoms or its isotopes as is well known in the art. The number of substitutions of the chromophore can be any amount practicable, the determining factor being the ultimate performance of the one component material as the recording layer in an optical recording medium. Generally, the number of substitutions is chosen so that the absorption maximum for the one component material corresponds with the output wavelength of the laser used in the optical recording. The thermomechanical properties of the material should also allow data to be recorded on the recording layer by a focused laser beam operating above a threshold power value for writing data and at a useful data rate. The data can then be read by a focused, but lower power, laser beam that causes no detrimental change in the signal obtained from the recording layer. The excellent absorption characteristics of the recording layer material allow the data to be read by changes in reflectivity. The thermomechanical properties of the one component material can also be controlled by the number and type of substitutions to allow laser addressed erasure of the data and to allow a film of the material to be cast by any technique known to those skilled in the art of coating. In general, therefore, the substituents of the chromophore are carefully designed so that the desired spectroscopic, thermomechanical and film forming properties are combined into a one component recording layer material. The number of substituents that has generally been found to be most suitable for purposes of a recording layer are within the following guidelines, which can vary, however, depending upon the particular properties desired. When the chromophore is substituted with the film conferring organic substituent at a central hetero atom, the number of such substitutions is 1 or 2. When the chromophore is substituted with the film conferring organic substituent at an aromatic ring, the number of such substitutions is between 1 and about 16, with the most preferred number of substitutions being between about 4 and 8. A combination of the two types of substitutions can be had. No substitution at the central position is possible when hydrogen or its isotope occupies the central position. The organo macrocyclic chromophore for the purposes of the present invention is an aza annulene containing a central hetero atom. The preferred aza annulene dyes are phthalocyanines, naphthalocyanines or substituted porphyrins. The macrocyclic portion of the chromophore can also be substituted with various substituents selected to influence the absorption spectrum of the chromophore. The substituents may be chosen such that the absorption maximum of the chromophore closely corresponds to the wavelength of light used in the recording, erasing, and in most cases, the reading processes. These substituents can also contribute to the ability of the one component material to be film forming. The most preferred aza annulenes are the naphthalocyanines having the following structural formula with any isomers thereof being contemplated for the purposes of the present invention wherein the X substituents are independently selected organic substituents and can be the same or different, with n and m indicating the number of independently selected X substituents, each n being the same or different and ranging from 0 to 4, and each m being the same or different and ranging from 0 to 2. Z is also an organic substituent with p representing the number of Z substituents, with p being either 0, 1 or 2. There must be at least one film conferring organic substituent. While only one type of film conferring substituent, X or Z, is generally required in a single molecular structure, both may be present. The method of chemically linking X and Z substituents to the dye ring or central atom can be any conventional method known to the skilled artisan. More specifically, the Z substituents can be alike or different, and can be present to confer film forming and or thermomechanical properties to the final one component material. Similarly, the ring substituents X may be the same or different, with X being chosen to affect the absorption spectrum or the film forming and thermomechanical properties of the one component material. A mixture of X substituents can also be chosen to affect both types of properties, i.e., spectral and thermomechanical. The number of Z substituents is determined by the nature of the central heteroatom, Y. The coordination geometry of Y can be octahedral, square pyramidal, or square planar, depending upon Y being six, five, or four coordinate. When the coordination geometry is octahedral, two Z substituents are present. Examples of octahedral geometry would include Y being Si, Ge, Sn and certain transition metals, e.g., Ti, Zr, Hf. When the square pyramidal structure is present, only one Z substituent is attached to Y. Examples of this geometry include Al, Ga, and In. Square planar geometry results in no Z substituents. Examples include cases where Y is selected from group IIa of the Periodic Table and certain transition metals. When Z substituents are present, film conferring and thermomechanical characteristics may arise from either the Z or X substituents. When Z substituents are absent, X substituents are used for this function. In all cases, X substituents can be used to control the absorption spectrum of the material. It is most preferred that Y is Si and that the film conferring substituents, whether the Z or X substituents, are comprised of acid, amide or ester units. Examples of specific preferred one component materials are materials of the formula SiNc Z ₂, where SiNc is silicon naphthalocyanine and Z is one of the following OSi CH₃ ₂O CH₂CH₂CH₂NH EMPOL 1010 NHCH₂CH₂NH EMPOL 1010 NHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH and, EMPOL 1010 Such recording layer materials can be synthesized, for example, by the reaction of dihydroxysilicon naphthalocyanine with alcohol terminated monomers or oligomers through a dichlorodialkylsilane coupling agent. The synthesis of dihydroxysilicon naphthalocyanine is described in the doctoral dissertation of Lee Arnold Schechtman, Conducting Poly metallonaphthalocyanines and Related Compounds , Case Western Reserve University, 1983. The polyether oligomers can be purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and the degree of polymerization, n, can be estimated from the given average molecular weight. The alcohol terminated dimer acid amides can be prepared by the condensation of Empol 1010 dimer acid purchased from Emery Industries, Inc. Cincinnati, OH. with the proper stoichiometry of the desired amino alcohol and optionally the desired diamines. Direct reaction of dihydroxysilicon naphthalocyanine with the alcohol terminated monomers or oligomers would also give acceptable materials. Reaction of dihydroxysilicon naphthalocyanine with a dichlorodialkylsilane coupling agent dichlorodimethylsilane being most preferred gives bis chloro dimethylsiloxy silicon naphthalocyanine. This intermediate can be reacted with the alcohol terminated monomers or oligomers to give the desired product in good yield. Ring substituted naphthalocyanine recording layer materials may be made by introducing the ring substituent X before adding the film conferring Z groups, if the Z groups are required to render the material film forming. The X ring substituent may be introduced in the naphthalocyanine precursor scheme I below , by direct electrophilic aromatic substitution on the naphthalocyanine scheme II below , or by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of a leaving group G on the naphthalocyanine ring scheme III below . In Scheme III fluoro, chloro, or nitro groups, introduced by Scheme I, are displaced by nucleophiles, e.g. amino, alkoxy, or mercapto groups. Scheme I is preferred since it allows more control of the position and degree of ring substitution. Scheme II gives varying degrees of substitution and different geometrical isomers, such that the product is a complex mixture. Similarly, Scheme III gives various degrees of substitution and the reaction invariably results in a mixture of partially substituted starting material. In Schemes II and III, the original X group introduced may be modified to give the particular substitutent desired, e.g., sulfonamides are produced by chlorosulfonating Si OH ₂Nc, followed by treatment with amines. In any case, once the desired naphthalocyanine ring substitution is achieved, the Z groups may be attached with the chemistry used for SiNc OH ₂. The film formed by the one component material of the present invention may be self supporting, in which case any suitable or conventional casting technique may be used. Generally, however, it is preferred to cast the material as a film on a suitable support to add dimensional stability and support thereto. As well, the film may not always be self supporting. The substrate may be optically featureless or may contain preformatting information e.g., tracking groove and or encoded information in the form of readable marks. It is important when coating a substrate, of course, that an extremely flat homogeneous information recording surface be obtained to preclude the scattering of light. Any suitable coating technique may be used to achieve such a flat surface, with a conventional technique such as spin coating, which allows for a high degree of control of film thickness and flatness, being preferred. It is, of course, important that the one component material form a thin film coating. The substrate which is coated should generally possess a surface of suitable smoothness. This may be imparted by appropriate molding or other forming techniques when the substrate is made. If the substrate has an inadequately smooth surface, a smoothing or subbing polymer layer may be used to attain the appropriate smoothness. Such a smoothing or subbing layer should not, of course, interfere with application or utilization of the recording layer which is subsequently applied thereto. The subbing layer can contain preformatting information. A suitable protective layer or cover, such as those known to the art, can also be used if desired to protect the recording layer from dirt, dust, scratches or abrasion. In an illustrative recording system embodying the principles of the present invention, a record blank disk form may be subject to rotation at a constant linear or constant angular velocity while a beam of light from a light source, e.g., a laser, is focused on the information surface of the disk. The intensity of the light beam is controlled in accordance with the information to be recorded. Illustratively, the control is effected in accordance with carrier waves modulated in frequency by information containing signals, with the light beam intensity varying as a result between a high level sufficient to effect a detectable change in the physical characteristics of the absorptive one component recording layer material and a low level insufficient to effect such a detectable change, the frequency of the level alternations varying as the signal amplitude changes. Preferred writing speeds are in the range of from 10⁶ to 10⁷ bits per second. The relative diameter and depth of the holes or pits formed will, of course, depend not only on the optical and thermal properties of the one component information layer, but also on the characteristics of the writing beam, i.e., focused spot diameter, depth of focus, intensity profile and intensity and duration of the writing pulse. Optimization of these parameters is familiar to those skilled in the art. As a result of the pit formation in the one component recording layer material, an information track comprising a succession of spaced pits is formed in the information surface of the disk, the pits appearing in those surface regions exposed to the high intensity beam. Variations in the length and separation of the pits are representative of the recorded information. The result of the above described recording process is the formation of an information record of a form which facilitates recovery of the recorded information by optical playback processes. The information track of such an information record comprises 1 undisturbed surface regions alternating with 2 pit regions formed by the pit forming process, preferably coated on a substrate. This information track can be in either analog or digital form, for example, audio, video or computer data. In playback or read operations pursuant to the principles of the present invention, a light beam is focused upon the information track of an information record. The playback beam has a constant intensity at a level insufficient to effect pit formation in the information layer or erasure of the recorded information by levelling. A photodetector, positioned to receive light reflected from the successive regions of the information track as they pass through the path of the focused light, develops a signal representative of the recorded information. Several variations in the playback or reading system as known to the art are possible. The most preferred mode of reading information involves the relative reflection between the one component material surface and those areas in which pits have been formed in the recordation of information. When the reflectivity of the one component material surface is of relatively high reflectivity as compared to that of the substrate, the reflectivity in the areas of the pits will be less than in the regions without pits when a beam from the read laser passes thereby. Thus, a written bit can be registered as a decrease in reflected intensity. When the relative reflectivity of the one component material surface is low as compared to that of the substrate, however, the reflectivity in the areas of the pits will be more than in the regions without pits when a beam from the read laser is focused thereon. Accordingly, a written bit can be registered as an increase in reflected intensity. An advantage of the present invention is that the resulting information medium can also be suitable for erasure. Complete and accurate erasure of recorded information can be readily carried out by heating the medium to a sufficiently high temperature such that the one component material becomes softened sufficiently to allow levelling of the surface. This can be done globally by heating the entire disk in an oven or some other suitable heating means, or by means of a defocused laser beam whose intensity at the surface of the information layer is intermediate between that of the write beam and read beam. It is generally necessary to heat an area greater than that of a single bit typically 1µm in diameter . The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which pertain to the synthesis of various one component materials useful as a recording layer in an optical recording medium. The details of the following examples, however, are in no way meant to be limitative, but rather merely illustrative.

The degree of substitution, n, averages about 5 as indicated by material balance. To a dry 500 ml three necked round bottom flask equipped with magnetic stirring, a Dean Stark moisture receiver, a reflux condenser, and a dry nitrogen purge is added 300 ml dry pyridine freshly distilled from calcium hydride , 2.00 g 2.19 mmol dihydroxysilicon tetrachloronaphthalocyanine, and 20 ml tri n butylamine dried over 4A molecular sieves . The mixture is heated to reflux and moisture is removed by azeotropic distillation until the water level measured by Karl Fischer titration is below 200 micrograms water per ml distillate. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and 8.0 ml 62 mmol dichlorodimethylsilane is added via syringe. The mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature overnight about 18 hr . The next day, the excess dichlorodimethylsilane b.p. 70 C is distilled from the reaction mixture. The distillation is continued until the boiling point of the distillate is greater than 115 C, indicating that all dichlorodimethylsilane is removed. To this reaction mixture is added 1.86 g 4.38 mmol polypropylene glycol 425 average molecular weight . The stirring mixture is refluxed for 1.75 hours under a blanket of dry nitrogen.

The ether solution is dried over calcium sulfate and then the ether is stripped off under vacuum. The product would be expected to be a green solid that is highly soluble in a number of organic solvents including dichloromethane. The aforedescribed recording layer materials can be cast on substrates using a number of techniques known to those skilled in the art of coating e.g., spin coating, roll coating . The materials have high solubility in one or more of the common solvents used for film casting e.g., 1,2 dichloroethane, trichloroethylene, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, 2 butanone cyclohexanone, 1 butanol . They can be coated on a variety of substrate materials such as glass, aluminum, and polymeric materials including polymethylmethacrylate and polycarbonate . They adhere well to the substrate material. Standard precautions known to those skilled in the art should be utilized to obtain films of acceptable quality for performance in optical recording media and the storage of information. The product from Example 4 was spin coated from 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane solution onto glass substrates. A 30 weight percent solution 3.0 g SiNc OSi CH₃ ₂OCH₂CH₂CH₂NH EMPOL 1010 NHCH₂CH₂NH Empol 1010 CHCH₂CH₂CH₂OH and 7.0 g 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane was carefully filtered through a 0.5 micrometer pore size membrane filter. The glass substrates were thoroughly cleaned by first treating with chromic acid solution, repeatedly rinsing with distilled water, and a final rinse with 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane. The substrates were dried under vacuum at 65 C prior to coating. In the spin coating step the glass substrates were mounted on the spin coater and completely flooded with the green solution. The substrates were then spun at a rate 250 to 1000 rpm that gave the desired film thickness for a time 20 60 sec required for the film to reach steady state. The films were then baked in a vacuum oven at 65 C overnight to remove 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane.
