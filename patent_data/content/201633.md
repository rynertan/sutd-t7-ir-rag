# SUBSTITUTED ANILIDE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a fluorescent polarization assay for acetaminophen, to the various compo nents needed for preparing and carrying out such an assay, and to methods of making these components. Specifically, tracers, immunogens and antibodies are disclosed, as well as methods for making them. The tracers and the im munogens are made from substituted anilide compounds. A fluorescein moiety is included in the tracer, while a poly amino acid forms a part of the immunogen. The antibodies are prepared in response to the immunogen. The assay is conducted by measuring the degree of polarization retention of plane polarized light that has been passed through a sample containing antiserum and tracer.
