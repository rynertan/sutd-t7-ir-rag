Verfahren zur Herstellung von Tetrahalogenbenzol Verbindungen der Formel I

## Description
This invention relates to a method of preparing tetrahalobenzene compounds useful in the synthesis of insecticides, chemical intermediates used therein and certain of the compounds themselves. According to the present invention there is provided a method of preparing tetrahalobenzene compounds of the formula I in which each X is independently chloro, or preferably, fluoro and Y is hydrogen or N R₃A in which each R is independently C₁ ₄ alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl, and A is a radical capable of forming an anion A , the method comprising partially or completely reductively cleaving the compound of formula IV to replace one or both N R₃A groups by hydrogen. The invention also includes a method of preparing tetrahalobenzene compounds of the formula I or a salt thereof, to form a compound of formula III b treating the compound of formula III with a quaternizing agent of formula RA to form compound of formula IV in which X and A have the meanings hereinbefore defined and c partially or completely reductively cleaving the compound of formula IV to replace one or both N R₃A groups by hydrogen. The invention further includes the combination of process steps b and c , the intermediate compounds of the formulae III and IV and compounds of the formulae I in which Y is N R₃A . Step a of the process may be carried out by any of the methods well known in the chemical art for the preparation of tertiary amines from primary amines, for example, by either a i treating the compound of formula II with one or more alkylating agents containing the R radicals or In step a i , the compound of formula II may be treated with, typically, one or more alkyl halides in an alcoholic solution. The reaction mixture is made alkaline and the tertiary amine recovered, by, for example, distillation. Conveniently, when the R radicals are to be the same, a single alkylating agent may be used in slight excess of the stoichiometric amount required to form the di tertiary amine. However, it is also envisaged that different alkylating agents could be used, either in admixture or separately, to form a range of products having different combinations of alkyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms of compound III . In alternative step a ii , the compound of formula II or a salt thereof may be reacted with one or more aldehydes or ketones or mixtures thereof in the presence of, for example, hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, at temperatures preferably above 45 C to avoid too slow a reaction. Conveniently, when the R radicals are to be the same, a single aldehyde or ketone is used in slight excess of the stoichiometric amount required to form the di tertiary amine. However, it is also envisaged, although not preferred, that step a ii could proceed in stages using in each stage different aldehydes or ketones or mixtures thereof to provide different values of R. Step b , the quaternisation of the compound of formula III , may be carried out by any of the methods well known in the chemical art for forming quaternary compounds. Conveniently, the compound of formula III is treated with an appropriate alkyl halide or sulphate, e.g. dimethylsulphate, in an alcoholic solution and, as necessary, in the presence of an acid binding agent such as magnesium oxide. The acid binding agent is used to mop up any acid formed as a result of hydrolysis of the quaternising agent. In a preferred aspect of the process of the invention, 1,4 bis aminomethyl 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorobenzene or a salt thereof is tetramethylated by step a ii in a single stage using formaldehyde as the aldehyde, and quaternised with a methyl halide. The intermediate compound having the formula V and the diquaternary salt obtained therefrom, having the formula VI in which A has the meaning hereinbefore defined, are preferred compounds of the invention. In step c , the di quaternary compound IV is partially or completely cleaved, that is deamminated, to form either the monoquaternary derivative, i.e. compound I in which Y is N R₃A , or the dimethyltetrahalobenzene, i.e. compound I in which Y is H. Deammination is achieved with a reducing agent such as hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst. The most suitable catalyst is palladium, especially palladium on carbon, preferably having a metal loading of from 3 to 20 by weight of palladium on carbon and especially 5 and 10 palladium on carbon which are grades of catalyst commercially available. Catalyst usages will depend on the temperature and pressure of reduction and whether complete or partial deammination is desired. These factors are more fully discussed later. In general, however, catalyst usages will range from 1.25 for partial deammination to 5 by weight of metal in the catalyst on diquaternary compound IV for complete deammination, when reduction is carried out at elevated temperatures and pressures, and up to 10 when complete deammination is carried out at atmospheric pressure. In a preferred method of complete deammination to form the dimethyltetrahalobenzene, the diquaternary compound IV is electrolysed in a protic medium, preferably water. Suitable materials for use as the cathode in this electrolytic method are lead, mercury and amalgamated metals such as amalgamated lead. The anode is conveniently platinum. Reduction takes place at potentials more negative than 1.0V against a saturated calomel electrode. Electrolysis is preferably carried out in a divided cell, for example, an H cell or Filter Press Plate and Frame cell having a diaphragm which is suitably a cation exchange membrane, for instance a Nafion membrane. The diquaternary compound in the protic medium is used as the catholyte. When water is the protic medium, the concentration of diquaternary salt in the aqueous solution is preferably from 7.5 w v up to a saturated solution, ideally about 20 w v. The anolyte may be any suitable electrolyte, usually a salt solution such as a saturated aqueous solution of sodium sulphate. The voltage applied across the electrodes will normally be sufficient to give a current density of, typically, about 100mAcm ², deammination being completed in about 5 hours at ambient temperature. During the electrolysis, a portion of the 1,4 dimethyltetrahalobenzene separates from the aqueous trialkylamine, which is formed as a result of deammination, a portion dissolves in the aqueous solution and a portion sublimes onto the wall of the electrolytic cell. The portions are dissolved in ether and residual trialkylamine washed out of the ether with aqueous inorganic acid. The crude 1,4 dimethyltetrahalobenzene may be purified by distillation. The monoquaternary salt having the formula VII in which X, R and A have the meanings hereinbefore defined, may be obtained by terminating the deammination step c partway through. This is most conveniently done when hydrogen is used as the deamminating agent in the presence of a catalyst. Under pressures up to about 17 atmospheres, particularly in the range of from 3 to 17 atmospheres, temperatures in the range of from 70 to 120 C, particularly 75 to 85 C and using a 5 palladium on carbon catalyst, the monoquaternary salt can be obtained. At lower pressures and or temperatures, higher catalyst usages and or metal loadings, e.g. 10 palladium on carbon, and extended reaction times are needed. At higher temperatures and or pressures and or catalyst usages deammination proceeds further and the 1,4 dimethyltetrahalobenzene is formed. Whether the diquaternary compound IV is deamminated by a chemical or electrochemical reduction, there is no substantial loss of the ring fluorine atoms. In contrast, attempts to deaminate the diamine II and the tetra alkylated compound III by catalytic hydrogenolysis using palladium catalysts have resulted in total and partial loss, respectively, of the ring halogen atoms. The starting material, the diamine II , may be obtained by a process which comprises reacting the appropriate 1,4 dicyanotetrahalobenzene with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst under acid conditions, as described in UK Patent Application No. 8312493 Publication No.2120666 . Conveniently, this process may be combined with step a ii of the present process without isolation of the compound II . Thus, for instance, the 1,4 dicyanotetrahalobenzene may be reacted with hydrogen in a pressurised autoclave at an elevated temperature in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, e.g. 5 palladium on carbon, an inert solvent, suitably methanol, an acid, preferably sulphuric acid and, optionally, a small amount of water. When hydrogenation is judged complete, an appropriate quantity of aldehyde or ketone or mixture thereof may be introduced to the autoclave and reacted with the hydrogenation product to form the compound of formula III . Alternatively, the process for preparing the 1,4 diaminomethyltetrahalobenzene and step a ii may be combined in a single stage, the aldehyde or ketone or mixture thereof being introduced to the autoclave before hydrogenation is commenced. In this case it is desirable to exclude water from the autoclave. If the 4 methyl 2,3,5,6 tetrahalobenzyl ester of a carboxylic acid is desired, then rather than proceeding via the 1,4 dimethyltetrahalobenzene and the appropriate alcohol or halide the ester may be formed by direct reaction of the monoquaternary salt VII with the carboxylic acid or a reactive derivative thereof, such as an alkali metal salt, an ammonium salt or an alkylammonium salt, preferably in a suitable organic solvent. 1,4 Dicyanotetrafluorobenzene may be obtained by fluorinating the corresponding tetrachlorinated compound with potassium fluoride in a polar aprotic solvent. 1,4 Dicyanotetrachlorobenzene is, itself, obtained from the commercially available tetrachloroterephthaloyl chloride by treatment with aqueous ammonia to give the diamide followed by dehydration using phosphorus oxychloride. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples 1 to 12 in which percentages are by weight.
