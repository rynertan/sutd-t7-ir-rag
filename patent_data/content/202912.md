# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE IN FORM OF SHIFT REGISTER WITH TWO PHASE CLOCK SIGNAL SUPPLY

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device in the form of a shift register is supplied with two phase clock signals. One of the two phase clock signal lines P1 is connected to even order shift register elements 0,2,4 of the shift register, and the other of the two phase clock signal lines P2 is connected to odd order shift register elements 1,3 shift register. Each of the shift register elements includes an output node S J
