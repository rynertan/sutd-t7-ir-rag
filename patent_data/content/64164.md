# A DEVICE FOR RAPIDLY COUPLING AND RELEASING A CHARACTER SUPPORT MEMBER OF THE DAISY WHEEL TYPE ON A TYPEWRITER

## Abstract
A typewriter not illustrated using a daisy wheel 1 as the type carrying member and having a unit 2 which drives the daisy wheel element to rotate about its axis and a device 30 for coupling the daisy wheel element 1 onto the drive unit. The coupling device 30 substantially comprises a pin 15 which engages a hole 4 in the daisy wheel element 1 first resilient means 34a, 34b carried by the unit 2 and operable to transmit to the daisy wheel element 1 an axial thrust in a first direction second resilient means 57 operable to transmit to the daisy wheel element 1 an axial thrust in a direction opposite the thrust generated by the first mentioned means and manual control means 61 which act on the said second resilient means 57 in such a way as to compensate, if actuated, the thrust generated by such second resilient means 57 .
