# Die transfer system.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to an improved die transfer sys tem 10 for a press having a bolster 16 for the support of a die 14 . The system comprises a pair of elongated, paral lel upwardly opening housings 22 and 24 having horizon tally extending vertically movable rails 26 and 28 therein. A plurality of rollers 42 are supported by each rail so as to be movable vertically therewith. An air bag 18 extends longitudinally of each of said housings under said rails and is engageable with the bottom thereof. Inflation of the air bags effects elevation of the rails and rollers into engage ment with the bottom of the die and elevation of the die relative to the press bolster. The rails have laterally extend ing flanges 50 that are engageable with complementary shoulders 46 and 48 on the housing to limit upward move ment of the rails and preclude bowing of the rails.

## Description
DIE TRANSFER SYSTEM Relatively heavy stamping and injection molding dies present a handling problem when such dies are assembled with or removed from the bolster of a press. The problem is complicated by the fact that the press generally has a ram or other superstructure mounted directly over the die support bolster precluding vertical lift of the die or die set by a conventional crane. Movement of a die set laterally with respect to the bolster of such presses has heretofore required relatively complex and fragile systems that are not compatible with the duty cycle of such presses. The die transfer system of the instant invention is relatively rugged and simple in construction.Roller supporting rails are orientated in spaced, parallel relation above the upper surface of the conventional bolster of a press. An air bag is disposed under each rail which, upon inflation effects elevation of the rail. Elevation of each rail is controlled by continuous stops along the sides of the air bags which positively limit upward movement of the rail and therefore the degree of elevation of the die. Upon elevation, the die is free to move in a direction parallel to the rails. Figure 1 is a perspective view of a press incorporating the die transfer system of the instant invention Figure 2 is a view taken in the direction of the arrow 2 of Fig. lt Figure 3 is a view taken in the direction of the arrow 3 of Fig. 25 and Figure 4 is a view taken substantially along the line 4 4 of Fig. 3. Figure 5 is a view, similar to Fig. 4, of another embodiment of the invention. As seen in Fig. 1 of the drawings, a die transfer system 10, in accordance with a first constructed embodiment of the instant invention, is mounted on a heavy duty press 12 to facilitate movement of die 14 on and off a bolster 16 of the press 12. The transfer system 10 comprises a pair of air bags 18 and 20 mounted in a pair of housings 22 and 24 and underlying a pair of rails 26 and 28, respectively.The air bags 18 and 20 are adapted to be energized by air at conventional shop pressures, for example, 3.5 7.0 kg l0 4m2 50 100 libs. per square inch . As best seen in Fig. 4 of the drawings, the housing 22, which is identical to the housing 24, comprises a pair of side frames 30 and 32 that are secured to a bottom plate 34 as by a plurality of bolts 36. The housing 22 is secured to the bolster 16 by machine screws 38. The air bag 18 supports a rail 40 having a plurality of rolls 42 thereon. The rolls 42 are journaled on shafts 44 so as to elevate and support the die 14 for movement upon energization of the air bag 18 and elevation of the rail 40. In accordance with the instant invention, two spaced, parallel shoulders 46 and 48 on the frames 30 and 32 are engageable with complementary flanges 50 and 52, respectively, on the rail 40 to limit upward movement of the rail 40. Because the shoulders 46 and 48 are coextensive with the flanges 50 and 52, bowing of the rail 40 is minimized thereby equalizing load on the rollers 42. As seen in Fig. 5, another embodiment of the instant invention comprises the rail 40 and air bag 18 which are set into an inverted T slot milled in a bolster 16a. The T slot defines spaced shoulders 46a and 46b which function to limit upward movement of the rail 40 as discussed above. This embodiment of the invention permits use of conventional clearances, stroke, and die set heights. Operation of the die transfer system 10 is best visualized by noting that, in Fig. 4, the air bag 18 is in the inflated condition and the rail 40 and each roller 42 thereon is elevated into engagement with the die 14 to effect elevation thereof. Deflation of the air bag 18 results in lowering of the rail 40 to a position wherein the upper surface of each roll 42 is disposed below the lower surface of the die 14 per misting the die 14 to rest upon side frames 30 and 32. From the foregoing description it should be apparent that the die transfer system of the instant invention is relatively simple, yet rugged in construction. It is operable to effect elevation of relatively heavy die sets so as to condition them for lateral movement on the rolls of the transfer system. The system is practical for die sets weighing from 0.9 75 t 1 80 US tons . In a workingembodiment, the lift rails 40 have 3900 rollers on 15.25 x 10 2m 6 inch centers. Lift is accomplished by air bag rated at 35 kg 10 4 2 at 35 kg 10 m 500 psi under the rail 40. When actua ted to on , the rail 40 lifts 0.95 x 10 m 3 8 inch to raise rollers 1.073 m 42 1 4 inch above the top face of the side frames 30 and 32 or top 36 of the bolster 16. Lift capacity is approximately 140000 per running centimeter 2500 per running foot , depending on kg 10 4m2 psi input.The coefficient of rolling friction on the rollers is .007, so that a 100001 die set requires only 70t push force to effect lateral movement thereof. To determine rail length for a given application, rail length in 10 2m is multiplied by 13.651 x air pressure in kg 10 m2 rail length in inches is multiplied by 2.4375 x air pressure in psi which equals lift force of rail. For example, a 122 x 10 2m long rail m 2 x 13.651 x 6.33 kg 10 m air a 48 inch long rail x 2.4375 x 90 psi air 10530 lift force. If the heaviest die set for a given press is 25000 it would require three rails resulting in a total of 31590 lift. 3 Air consumption is approximately 0.0049 m per running meter 1 20 cu. ft. per running foot of rail. 3 4 2 3Specifically, 0.0175 m at 7.03 kg 10 m and 0.0014 m at 5.6 kg 10 in 0.578 cu. ft. at 100 psi and .G477 cu.ft. at 80 psi . Therefore, as an example, a 40000 die set using approximately 6.1 m 20 feet of rail, would 3 use 0.03 m 1 cu. ft. of air to fill the system. While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, it should be appreciated that the invention is susceptible of modification without departing from the scope of the following claims.
