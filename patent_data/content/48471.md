# Lymphoblastoid cell lines capable of continuously and spontaneously producing interferon, process for preparing the same, and process for the human interferon production by the same.

## Abstract
A lymphoblastoic cell line has been produced, which, when cultured in a culture medium for mammalian cells, produces human interferon continuously and spontaneously without being stimulated with an IFN inducer. This lymphob lastoid cell line is produced by transforming a human lymphocyte, which is isolated from human blood of an infant of the age of not more than two years, a new born infant or an aborted human fetus or from spleen cells of an aborted human fetus with Epstein Barr Virus.
