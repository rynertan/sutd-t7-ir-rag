# Color liquid crystal display apparatus.

## Abstract
Arrangements of picture element electrodes of a color liquid crystal display apparatus. In a color liquid crystal dis play apparatus using mosaic arrangements, the same color of picture elements which are driven by the same signal elec trode are alternately arranged right and left. Accordingly, all the necessary thing is that the same color of picture signal is applied upon the same signal electrode in spite of the mosaic arrangement. Thus, a circuit is rendered unnecessary which switches a color image signal of an analog line mem ory, so that the driving circuit is extremely simplified.
