# Apparatus for extruding a fillet.

## Abstract
For applying pasty material to form a fillet in a region 25 between two surface parts 23, 24, an extrusion nozzle 14 has guide means including wiping portions 17 for contacting the surface parts adjacent to the region to exclude extruded pasty material from them. Between the wiping portions is a fillet forming portion 21 to straddle the region and form extruded pasty material into the desired fillet. The apparatus may be a part of a collapsible tube or other extrusion device or may have a separate part for mounting on the nozzle of an extrusion device.
