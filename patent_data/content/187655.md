# ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC PHOTOSENSITIVE DEVICE

## Abstract
In an electrophotographic photosensitive device, which comprises an electroconductive support 100 , a photocon ductive layer 200 provided thereon, and a surface protec tive layer 300 provided on the photoconductive layer 200 , the surface protective layer 300 is made from a film having a local level density of no more than 5 10¹⁷ cm ³ and a higher dark resistance than the photoconductive layer 200 . The surface protective layer 300 is less susceptible to deterioration and adhesion to the photoconductive layer 200 is enhanced. Thus the device has a prolonged life.
