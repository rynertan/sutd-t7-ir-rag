# PURIFICATION OF ALKYLATED ANTHRAQUINONES

## Abstract
The invention is for a process for removing unalkylated anthraquinones from alkylated anthraquinone by forming a solution thereof, reducing the solution sufficiently so that at least part of the unalkylated anthraquinone is in the reduced form and extracting the reduced solution in the absence of an oxidizing agent with an aqueous alkaline solution. The process is especially suited for removing anthraquinone from an alkylated anthraquinone for use in the manufacture of hydrogen peroxide by reducing and oxidizing a solution of the alkylated anthraquinone.
