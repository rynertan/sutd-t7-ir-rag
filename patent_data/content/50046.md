# Electrocoating apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrocoating apparatus has a plurality of cells 10 movable successively to each of a plurality of operating stations 1 to m . An electrical circuit is provided to monitor the cells and initiate the application of electrical pulses to each cell 10 , if the cell has not exhibited any faults. Each cell is subjected to a test at station 1 and a test at station n and the result of each test is entered as a binary digit in a respective shift register 13, 14 . As the cell is advanced each binary digit is similarly advanced in its shift register by clock pulses. Unidirectional electrical pulses are applied as electro coating pulses at electrocoating stations n 1, n 2 and n 3 such that each cell is normally subjected to three successive discrete pulses. However, if a cell which has failed either of the tests arrives at the electrocoating stations, the presence of its binary digit in the appropriate stage of the shift register 14 inhibits the application of electrocoating pulses thereto. Furthermore application of the electrocoating pulses to a cell is immediately interrupted if the cell goes short circuit.
