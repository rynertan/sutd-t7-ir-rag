# Ball bearing.

## Abstract
It has been found that improvement in cage stability at such high speed 10⁴ 10⁵ r.p.m. is obtained when the cage pockets 5 are provided with specific shaped annular protruding parts 6 to which a ball 3 during running will support. Due to this feature, forces F₁ µF₁ are introduced which are circumferential directed along the ball 3 . In case of upcoming instability, for ces F₂ µF₂ in radial direction between the cage pockets 5 and balls 3 are generated which urge the cage 4 to take in its stable position.
