## Description
ANTIBACTERIAL COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to compounds having antibacterial and or antimycoplasmal activity, to processes for their production and to their use in human and veterinary medicine. U.K. Patent No. 1 587 059 describes a class of compounds including monic acid A and pharmaceutically acceptable esters thereof having the formula EMI1.1 monic acid A, R R It has now been found that a certain narrow class of pharmaceutically acceptable monic acid A esters, falling within the above formula but not specifically disclosed in the above patent, have particularly advantageous properties including good antibacterial and or antimycoplasmal activity. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl, and R2 is hydrogen or alkyl. As used herein the term alkyl refers to groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Such groups having 3 or 4 carbon atoms may be straight, branched or cyclic. Preferably the alkyl group of R1 is methyl or ethyl, most preferably methyl. Preferably R2 is hydrogen. R1 may be located at any position on the benzene ring suitably it is at the meta or para position with respect to the monic acid residue, preferably at the para position. The present invention also provides a process for producing compounds of formula I , which process comprises reacting a compound of formula II EMI2.2 wherein X is a good leaving group with a reactive derivative of monic acid A. As used herein the term reactive derivative of monic acid A refers to any compound capable of reacting with the compound of formula II to produce a compound of formula I Suitably X is halogen, alkylsulphonate or arylsulphonate preferably X is halogen and most preferably chlorine wr bromine. Suitably the reactive derivative of monic acid A is an alkali metal salt thereof, preferably the sodium salt. The reaction is suitably effected at ambient or elevated temperature, preferably at about 20 to 1000C, in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide. The product may be purified by chromatographic techniques, such as column chromatography on silica gel. Compounds of formula I wherein R1 is alkylthio may be oxidised to the corresponding compound wherein R1is alkylsulphinyl and or alkylsulphonyl using conventional oxidising agents. Likewise the compounds wherein R1 is alkylsulphinyl may be oxidised to the corresponding alkylsulphonyl derivative. Suitable oxidising agents include peracids, hydroperoxides, t butyl hypochlorite, N bromosuccinimide and m chloroperbenzoic acid. When certain oxidising agents are employed, it may be desirable to protect other oxidisable groups on the monic acid nucleus prior to the reaction and to remove such protection after the oxidation reaction. This may be achieved using conventional protecting groups, such as those described in European Patent Application No. 0005006. Such protection is not always necessary for instance it has been found that when m chloroperbenzoic acid is used as oxidising agent, good yields may be achieved without protection of the monic acid nucleus. Monic acid A is readily obtainable by the methods described in U.K. Patent No. 1 587 058, and reactive derivatives thereof are produced by conventional methods. The infections of humans against which compounds of this invention are particularly useful include venereal disease, The compounds are also effective in the treatment of respiratory infections such as bacterial bronchitis and bacterial meningitis, non specific urethritis and pneumonia. In animals, the compounds may be employed for the treatment of mastitis in cattle, for swine dysentery, and for mycoplasma infections in animals such as turkeys, chickens, pigs and cattle. Some of the human and veterinary diseases either caused by mycoplasma species or in which they play a prominent role, and against which compounds of this invention are effective, are as follows Avian M gallisepticum Chronic respiratory diseases air sacculitis of chickens and TurkeysBovine M bovis Mastitis, respiratory disease and arthritis of cattle M di spar Calf pneumonia Porcine M suipneumoniae Enzootic pneumonia of pigs M hyorhinis arthritis in pigs M hyosynoviae Human M pneumoniae primary atypical pneumonia Compounds of the present invention are particularly useful in the treatment of enzootic pneumonia in animals such as pigs, cattle and sheep, because they also have activity against the bacteria Bordetella bronchispetica,Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus spp, which often cause respiratory complications in cases of this disease. Accordingly the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition which comprises a compound of formula I hereinafter referred to as the drug together with a pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable carrier or excipient. The compositions may be formulated for administration by any route appropriate to the disease being treated.The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, and liquid or gel preparations, such as oral, topical or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dosage form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrollidone fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maizestarch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica and disintegrants, ior example potato starch, or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.Such liquid preparations may contain aqueous or non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol and conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin hydrogenated edible fats emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid and, if desired, conventional flavouring or colouring agents. For topical application to the skin, the drug may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. Cream or ointment formulations that may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry sCosmeticology published by Leonard Hill Books, and theBritish Pharmacopoeia. Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, eg cocoa butters or other glyceride, For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the drug and a sterile vehicle. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the drug can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing.Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and water removed under vacuum. The dry lypophilized powder is then sealed in the vial. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the drug is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The drug can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the drug. For topical application to the ear, the drug may be made up into a solution or suspension in a suitable liquid carrier, such as water, glycerol, diluted ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol or fixed oils. For topical application to the eye, the drug is formulated as a solution or suspension in a suitable, sterile aqueous or non aqueous vehicle. Adjuvants, for instance buffers such as sodium metabisulphite or sodium edetate preservatives including bactericidal and fungicidal agents, such as phenylmercuric acetate or nitrate, benzalkonium chloride or chlorhexidine, and thickening agents such as hypromellose may also be included. The dosage employed for compositions administered topically will, of course, depend on the size of the area being treated. For the ears and eyes each dose will typically be in the range from 10 to 100 mg of the drug. Veterinary compositions for intramammary treatment of mammary disorders in animals, especially bovine mastitis, will generally contain a suspension of the drug in an oily vehicle. The compositions may contain from 0.1 to 99 by weight, preferably from 10 60 by weight, of the drug.Where the compositions are in unit dosage form, each unit will preferably contain from 50 500 mg, of the drug.The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 mg to 3 g, per day, for instance 250 mg to 2 g, per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration. Alternatively, the drug may be administered to animals as part of the total dietary intake. In this case the amount of drug employed may be less than 1 by weight of the diet and is preferably no more than 0.5 by weight. The diet for animals may consist of normal foodstuffs to which the drug may be added or it may be included in a premix. A suitable method for administering the drug to animals is to add it to the animals drinking water. In this case a concentration of drug in the drinking water of about 5 500 pg ml, for example 5 266 pg ml, is suitable. The present invention further provides a method for treating bacterial and or mycoplasmal infections in human and non human animals, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined to a human or non human mammal suffering bacterial and or mycoplasmal infection. Alternatively, a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition, as hereinbefore described, is employed in the above method.
