# Optical scanning apparatus with dynamic scan path control.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a primary scanner including laser light sources 10B, 10C and rotating polygonal mirror 12 , which produces a scanning optical beam on a drum 16 , and a photoresponsive error sensor 22, 24, 28 which effectively measures over the scan path the successive differences between the actual position of the scanning beam and the desired position of the scanning beam and produces error signal. A secondary scanner 30, 32 is connected to the error sensor for response to the error signals to dynamically correct the position of the scanning beam during the course of the scan. The primary scanner provides a main optical scanning beam and an auxiliary optical scanning beam 20C traversing substantially the same optical path. The error sensor includes a graticule mask 22 having a substantially uniform optical density along the desired scan path and a graded optical density transverse to the desired scan path of the auxiliary scanning beam.
