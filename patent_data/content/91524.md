# Grit seal for cotton gin roller bar.

## Abstract
A cotton gin bar 16 including a roller assembly comprising a pair of discs 26,28 rotatably arranged on the upper portion of the bar at the ginning point, the discs 26,28 being operative on opposing sides of the bar for detaching lint from cotton seed. Each roller disc 26,28 is provided with an annular rib 30 and the gin bar 16 is provided with an annular groove 34 in which the rib 30 is received, thereby defining a rotatable seal. The rotatable seal restricts the passage of small particles such as grit and lint which interfere with operation of an annular ball bearing 38 on which each roller disc is mounted.
