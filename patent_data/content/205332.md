# Colour modification in image reproduction systems.

## Abstract
This relates to apparatus for modifying colours in image reproduction systems. Digital signals are generated for each pixel of an image to be reproduced, the digital signals corres ponding to the values of colour components in each pixel. The respective colour component values of each pixel are applied to a set of look up tables 30 which are so loaded that they recognise whether the colour component values of a pixel fall within a colour range or colour ranges for which a processing operation is to be carried out. The look up tables 30 provide an output signal representing one of a number of possible processing operations for that pixel, in the form of an opera tion number. The operation number signal is applied through a processor 22 to an operation select table 36 which con verts the operation number into a specific processing opera tion for each colour component. The processing operations may be retouching, image retention no change , replacement by a tint value or dropout. Means are provided 44, 42, 38 and 40 for carrying out these operations under the control of the operation select table and transferring the resulting pixel values to an output buffer. The look up tables 30 may define the colour ranges within which processing operations are required in terms of a range of a single colour component or coinciding ranges of 2, 3 or 4 colour components.
