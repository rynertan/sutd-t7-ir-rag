# Low capacitance airless spray apparatus.

## Abstract
An airless electrostaic spray apparatus 10 comprising, an elongated body 11 of insulating material having first and second passages 34, 38 therethrough, the first passage being adapted to be connected with a supply of liquid coating material under sufficient pressure to effect airless atomization of the liquid coating material, valve means for controlling flow of liquid coating material through the first passage, electrical circuit means including electrical restistor means in the second passage, the circuit means being adapted to be connected to a source of electrical potential, a nozzle mounting ring 32 of insulative material having an axial passage 60 therethrough, the axial passage of the nozzle mounting ring being coaxially aligned with the first passage of the elongated body, an adapter 31 , having an axial passage 65 therethrough and being mounted within the axial passage of the mounting ring, an electrically conductive airless spray nozzle 30 , mounted within the axial passage of the adapter, electrically non conductive sealing means 33 operable between the adapter and the elongated body, and an electrode mounted within the nozzle mounting ring, the electrode 20 being electrically con nected to the electrical circuit means but electrically insu lated from the electrically conductive nozzle. The gun is characterized by a low capacitance which enables the electrode of the gun to be shorted to a grounded object without the resulting spark having sufficient energy content to ignite the surrounding atmosphere.
