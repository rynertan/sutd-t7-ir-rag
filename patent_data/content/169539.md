# Control apparatus for charging generator.

## Abstract
A control apparatus incorporated in a charging gener ator 1 for controlling interruption of an exciting current supplied to a field winding 4 of the charging generator comprises a power transistor 9 for intermittently interrupt ing the exciting current, a voltage detecting circuit 13, 14, 15 for controlling on off of the power transistor depending on the voltage generated by the charging generator, a current detecting circuit 18, 20 for detecting an initial exciting current supplied to the field winding until the charging generator generates an output voltage high enough for starting its charging operation, and a circuit 11 for turning off the power transistor as soon as the value of the current detected by the current detecting circuit exceeds a predeter mined setting.
