# ARRANGEMENT FOR SENSING SEVERAL COMPONENTS OF FORCE

## Abstract
A strain sensing arrangement includes a rigid annular ring 1 with axis AA , an upper central boss 2 and a lower co axial central boss 3 . An upper array of vertical, relative ly flat, wide an flexible beams 4, 5, 6 are connected to the upper boss 2 and the ring 1 and a lower array of horizont al beams 8, 9 are connected to the lower boss 3 and the ring 1 . Each of the beams 4 6, 11, 8, 9, 12, 13 are provided with a strain gauge 7, 10 on each side thereof for detecting any deflection of the beams. When the arrangement is utilised in an assembly robot, the end of an arm of the robot is inserted downwardly into the upper boss 2 and a gripper is inserted upwardly into the lower boss 3 , so that the strain gauges 7, 10 can detect torsional and or linear strain acting on the arrange ment caused by relative rotation of the gripper with respect to the arm.
