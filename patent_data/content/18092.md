## Description
IMPROVSMENTS IN OR ELATING TO FLUID SAMPLING This invention relates to fluid sampling, e.g.sampling solutions of pharmaceutical tablet or capsule preparations for dissolution testing. The British Pharmacopoeia and the United StatesPharmacopoeia set out the broad requirements for the dissolution testing of such pharmaceutical preparations.These requirements render it necessary to perform sampling operations repeatedly on each test solution, i.e. at appropriate time intervals over an extended tile period.Where Just one single test solution is concerned, the time intervals can be measured by a simple timing mechanism and the sampling operation can be readily undertaken by pipette.however, where several test solutions are to be sampled simultaneously, manual sampling by pipette is physically impossible for absolute sisultaneity, and even small time differences as between the supposedly simultaneously taken samples can, upon analysis of the samples, lead to inaccurate analysis results. Furthermore, the use of pipettes for extracting the sample of fluid can lead to residual droplets from one sampling operation being transferred to the sample extracted by the next sampling operation. Thus inaccurate test results can arise even if the pipette is washed out between successive sampling operations since droplets of the washing fluid would merely replace the sample droplets . For specific use in dissolution testing, apparatus has been proposed which coabines in one unit means for both sampling and inediate analysis. In use this apparatus has a continuous conduit path for fluid extending from the test solution to and through a spectrometer analysis device. Such apparatus is very expensive and cannot readily be used to obtain separate fluid samples that may be treated e.g. by mixture with air or specified reagents prior to analysis by the spectrometer device. To overcome the above an or other drawbacks of prior art arrangements it is therefore desirable to provide apparatus for use in automatically sampling several fluids simultaneously, the sampling being performed at predetermined time intervals over a predetermined time period, and the individual samples being retained in respective containers e.g. for subsequent treatment and or for analysis . According to a first aspect of this invention there is provided apparatus for use in fluid sampling, said apparatus including a sampling means compr sing a carrier having a plurality of locations for open topped containers in a regular array means to index the carrier in steps to present a predetermined number of said locations at a common charging station a bracket providing or supporting a plurality of conduit outlets in a corresponding array, each outlet being for discharge of an associated fluid sample and the number of said outlets being equal to said predetermined number of locations means to move the bracket between a first position, spaced above the carrier at said charging station, in which all said outlets can simultaneously discharge fluid from said conduits into respective carrier supported open topped containers at said common charging station and a second position in which all said outlets car simultaneously discharge fluid from said conduits into a waste receptacle b pump means to effect fluid flow through said conduits simultaneously from a plurality of fluids to be sampled and c control means to be operatively connected to said sampling means and said pump means for automatically effecting the following cycle or sequence of operations a predetermined number of tines i after a first predetermined time interval, actuating the pump means for a first predetermined time period with the bracket in said second position, ii actuating the bracket moving means te move the bracket to said first position, iii actuating the pump for a second predetermined time period to charge simultaneously, via said conduits, containers at the charging station with respective fluid samples, and iv actuating the bracket moving means to move the bracket to said second position and, before after or simultaneously, actuating the indexing meats to index the carrier by a predetermined number of said steps to present afresh said predetermined number of locations at the common charging station.

The apparatus illustrated in Fig 1 is for obtaining fluid samples in batches of six at a time, a selectively preset number of times, the batches being obtained at selectively pre set intervals of time. The samples are of selectively pre set volume and obtained, for dissolution testing or analysis e.g. in a spectrophotoineter , from six pots or flasks 90 only two being shown in Pig 1 in which pharmaceutical tablet preparations 95 are being dissolved.The apparatus comprises a peristaltic pump 40 to withdraw fluid from each of the pots and pass it via an associated one of six flexible conduits 65 only one being wholly shown inFig 1 to a sampling device 45, operation ot the pLap and sampling device being controlled by a controller 70. The sampling device 45 as illustrated in Pig8 1, 2 and 3 comprises a housing 50 of generally L shape. A motor driven rotary indexing mechanism 51, mounted within the lower horizontal limb 52 of the housing, has a vertical output shaft 49 projecting through, or in alignment with, an aperture 48 in the upper surface of limb 52. A turntable 53, removably mounted on the output shaft of the indexing mechanism to overlie said upper surface, is provided with compartments or holes each to locate a cup or similar open topped container 54 for a fluid sample.The arrangement of the compartments or holes is such that the containers 54 are located in a single arcuate line adjacent the periphery of the turntable 53 and in equi angularly spaced relation to one another, the arc being centred on the axis of the vertical output shaft of the indexing mechanism 51. Conveniently, forty such containers can be so located on the turntable 53. The upper surface of housing limb 52 also provides a platform for a removable waste gutter or receptacle 55 disposed between the turntable 53 and the vertical limb 56 of the housing. At its upper end, the vertical limb 56 of the housing is provided with two laterally spaced, forwardly directed, fixed arms 57 that overlie the housing s horizontal limb 52. A pivot rod 58 extends horizontally between the two fixed arms 57 and a swinging frame 59 is pivotally mounted on the pivot rod 58 for arcuate movement in a vertical plane. The frame 59, which is immovable laterally of rod 58, comprises a lower horizontal bracket 60 connected to and between the lower ends of two laterally spaced limbs 61 that are mounted rotatably on the horizontal pivot rod 58 by their upper ends. The bracket 60 is at a level slightly above the top of the containers 54 on turntable 53 and is provided with six vertical holes 64 therethrough.These six holes are disposed in a single arcuate line having substantially the same radius of curvature, and sense, as the turntable located containers 54, the six holes 64 being equi angularly spaced at substantially the same angular spacing as that between the turntzble located containers 53. These six holes provide or support the ends of flexible conduits 65 from the six solutions to be sampled and constitute the conduit outlets. One of the limbs 61 of frame 59 is pivotally connected by its lower end to one end of a lever 62 extending inwardly of the housing s vertical limb 56 through a vertical slot 63.The other end of lever 62, within the housing, is connected eccentrically to the output shaft 47 of an electric motor herein sometimes referred to as the arm motor1 or bracket motor 66. A cam 67 mounted on the output shaft of the arm motor 66 co operates with a micro switch 68 such that, for a first half revolution of the arm motor 66, the lever 62 swings the bracket 60 of frame 59 away from the housings vertical limb 56 and positions the six conduit outlets 64 above six of the turntable supported containers 54, and such that, for the second half revolution of the arm motor 66, the lever 62 swings the bracket 60 of frame 59 towards the housing s vertical limb 56 and positions the six conduit outlets 64 above the waste gutter or receptacle 55 see Fig 2 . Thus in the first bracket position fluid from the six conduits 65 can be simultaneously discharged into resp ctive open topped containers 54 below the bracket, i.e. at a charging station, and in the second bracket position illustrated in Fig 2 , fluid from the six conduits 65 can be simultaneously discharged into the waste gutter or receptacle 55. Fluid flow through the six flexible conduits 65 is effected by the pump 40 which is a motor c riven, variable speed, sulti channel peristaltic pump that provides an external squeezing action on the flexible conduits 65. In sampling for dissolution testing the same pump 40 may simultaneously control flow through a further six conduits 69 only one being wholly shown in Fig 1 supplying replenishment solvent from a container 96 to the receptacles 90 from which the solution samples are being taken. Figure 3 shows the electrical components within the housing 50 of the sampling means and their connection to the rotor 41 of the peristaltic pump 40 via a three way plug and socket coupling Lp, Np and Ep and to the controller 70 via a tbree way plug and socket coupling Lc Nc and Ec and a fourway plug and socket coupling 1, 2, 3, 4.With an ON OFF switch 46 of the sampling means closed, an input signal at 2 from the controller 70 actuates relay 71 and switch 68 to energise the arm motor 66 thus to effect one half revolution, an input signal at 3 from the control device 70 actuates relay 72 and switch 73 to energise the turntable motor 74 of the indexing mechanism 51 whereby the motor 74 effects one complete revolution and a consequential one step or onelocation indexing of the turntable 53, and an input signal at 4 from the control device 70 actuates relay 75 to energise the pump motor 41. The controller 70, snown in greater detail in Figs 4 and 5, comprises a transformer rectifier 76 having mains voltage input from coupling Lca Mc and Sc to provide D.C.output voltages of 12 volts and 5 volts, as well as an earth 0 volts , to a microprocessor circuit Fig 4A and 4B conjoined connected to a decoding circuit Fig 5 . The microprocessor circuit includes a microprocessor chip SC NP Type ISP 8A soOn , two read write memories RAM TypeMM210lN , a read only memory ROM Type MM5214 or Me 5244 , an 8 bit buffer BUF Type DX81LS95 between the outputs of the memory devices and the SC MP chip inputs, a Hex Schmitt trigger HS Type DM7414N to provide the level conversions for serial input and output to and from the microprocessor chip SC MP, a quartz crystal oscillator Y1 1000 Maz connected to the microprocessor chip SC MP to provide timing pulse signals thereto, and a voltage regulator VR Type L320HP 12 to provide a supply of 7 volts to terminals 5 and 40 BREQ andVGG of the microprocessor chip SC MP, the components being interconnected as shown in Fig 4. The microprocessor circuit and the decoding circuit are interconnected via connections referenced 1A, lC 8A, 9A,9C, lOA, lOC 12A, 12Css 14A, 14C, 15C 2IA 31C, and 32A, 32C.Connections IA, 1C are at 5 volts, connections 32A, 32C are earthed 0 volts , connections 8A, 9A, 9C, lOA and lOC are the input data bus lines to the microprocessor chip SC MP from the decoding circuit, connections 12A and 12C are the input lines to terminal SENSEB and terminal SENSE A of the microprocessor chip connection 12A being coupled via resistor R5 to the 5 volts supply line , connections 14A, 14C and 15C are the output lines from terminals FLAG 1, FLAG 0 and FLAG 2 respectively, connection 21A is the address line ADII of the microprocessor chip, and connection 31c is the negative read data strobe line to terminal NRDS of the microprocessor chip. Optionally the connection J3 to the buffer BUF may be connected e.g.selectively to the address line ADII of chip SC MP instead of being connected to earth via connection J4. The decoding circuit of Fig 5 induces two NOR gate integrated circuits A1 A4 and B1 B4 Type 74LSO2 connected as shown in Fig 5 with NOR gate B4 connected to a tristate latchTL Type 81LSO2 controlling the data input to the microprocessor chip SC MP. The data input is determined by two setting devices 77, 78 connected to the tristate latch TL.Setting device 77 is a ten position rotary switch, having the external form of a numbered thumbwheel, mounted on a front panel 7g of the control device housing adjacent a legend PROGRAM . Setting device 78 is a two position electrical switch mounted either on the front panel 79 or, as is preferred, on a rear panel not shown of the control device housing. Another two position electrical switch 80 is mounted either on front panel 79 or, as is preferred, on the rear panel to provide a potential at SENSE B of the microprocessor chip selectively either of zero volts by connecting to earth via connections 32A, 32C or of 5 volts by pulling connection 12A high via resistor R5 if switch 80 is left open .The front panel 79 also has mounted thereon, adjacent a legend START , a momentary contact electrical switch 81 to connect SENSE A of the microprocessor chip selectively to earth connections 32A, 32C , or to the 5 volts supply connections lA, 1C . In addition, four light emitting diodes 82, 83, 84 and 85 are mounted on the front panel 79 adjacent respective legends ARM MOTOR , TURNTABLE , PUMP and RUNNING .The light emitting diode 85 is controlled by the output signal at connection 14C from terminal FLAG 4 of the microprocessor chip, and the liht emitting diodes 82, 83 and 84 are controlled respectively by the outputs of NOR gates A3 B3 anc A2.Said liOR gates also control the output signals to respectively 2, 3 and 4 of the four way coupling of controller 70 to the sampling aevice 45, such control being effected as follows a when the signal in to each of the two connections 14A and 15C is high, a one second output pulse signal is supplied via 3 and relay 72 in conjunction with switch 73 to actuate the turntable motor 74 for one revolution b when the signal in to connection 14A is high. and in to connection 15C is low, a one second output pulse signal is supplied via 2 and relay 71 in conjunction with switch 68 to actuate arm motor 66 for halt of one revolution c when the signal in to connection 14A is low and in to connection 15C is high, a continuous output signal is supplied via 4 and relay 75 to actuate the pump motor 41 and d when the signal in tc each of the two connections l4A and 15C is low, no output is provided and a delay occurs. The microprocessor circuit is pre programied with several timing programs, each program being selected in accordance with the operational state or setting of the switches 77, 78 and 80 to provide the appropriate output signals at 2, 3 and 4 at the appropriate times or after appropriate time intervals. The general form of the timing programs is explained below inter alia with reference to Figs 6 and 7 . The ten position thumbwheel switch 77 sets the times at which samples are to be taken, e.g. the sample times set out in Table I below. The two state switch 78 is used to set the volume size of each sample by governing the running times of the pump motor 41, i.e. the signal duration to 4.For example, with pump 40 set to deliver fluid at a rate of 10 ml min, volumetric discharges of 10 ml and 4 ml can be achieved with pump running times of respectively 60 secs and 24 secs. The two state switch 80 governs the number of pulses supplied in each cycle to 3, i.e. to the motor 74 of the indexing mechanism 51. Each one second pulse effects one revolution of motor 74 that is converted by the step down gear transmission of the indexing mechanism to provide a one step movement of the turntable.With switch 80 in one state herein called the 6666 state the circuits provide six pulses, effecting six indexing steps of the turntable 53, in each and every cycle, whereas with switch 80 in the other state herein called the 6868 state the circuits provide six pulses, and six resultant indexing steps, in each oddnumbered cycle and provide eight pulses, and eight resultant indexing steps, in each even numbered cycle. To set up the apparatus such as to obtain samples for dissolution testing of pharmaceutical tablets, the sampling device 45, pump 40 and controller 70 are electrically connected to one another as indicated above, the sampling device 45 supporting a turntable 53 with sufficient empty sample cups 54 for several sampling cycles. Six pots or flasks 90 are each filled with a specified volume e.g. 1 litre of solvent 91 and placed in a water bath 92 maintained at a specified temperature by a beater and thermostat arrangement 93 See Fig 1 .One tablet 95, the dissolution of which is to be tested, is placed in each of six wire sesh baskets 94 disposed respectively above the pots 90, the baskets 94 being movable vertically to imnerse the tablets into the solvent 91 in the six pots 90 and being also rotatable or oscillatable to agitate the tablet 95 therein. The six flexible conduits 65 are connected to the bracket holes constituting the conduit outlets 64 and their opposite ends are inserted into the solvent 91 in the respective six pots 90, the conduits intermediate their ends being passed over or around the operative mechanism of the peristaltic pump 40.The further six conduits 69 are connected between the six pots 90 and a common container 96 of the solvent disposed externally of the bath 92 such that as ii sample solutions are withdrawn from the pots 90 by the pump 40, the latter simultaneously feeds each of the six pots with an equal volume of solvent, as a replenishment, from container 96. Thus the specified volume of fluid in each pot 90 remains constant throughout. The length of each of the conduits 65 is kept as short as possible and, in any event, provides a volume no greater than 10 l. Switch 46 on the sampling device 50 is switched 0N, and the controller s witches 77, 78 and 80 are set to provide the program, sample size and indexing arrangement required. With switch 80 in the 168681 state, two empty sample cups 54 will be left after every twelve samples have been taken thereby allowing the operator, at the conclusion of sampling, to fill these empty cups with a standard or reference solution for use in subsequent analysis . The bracket 60 is moved manually to its said second position in which the conduit outlets 64 are above the waste gutter cr receptacle 55, and the START button provided by nomentary contact switch 81 is depressed.This initiates operation of the pump motor 41 which, under the control of the program, runs for the period S see Figs 6 and 7 , conveniently lj minutes, so as to prize the conduits 65 with fluid fzom the pots SO and replenish the pots with solvent from container 96 via the conduits 69. Simultaneously the light emitting diodes 85 and 84 associated with the legends RUNNING ana PUMP will be on to signify visually that the controller is operational and that the pump is on. At the end of tile period 8, i.e. when the conduits 65 are primed, the pump motor stops automatically and the lightemitting diodes 84 and 85 both go off. The operator then lowers the six wire mesh baskets 94, each containing the tablet to be dissolved into the solvent 91 and starts rotation or oscillation of the baskets, simultaneously again depressing the START button 81 of the controller 70. The time period X in Figs 6 and 7 denotes the varying time interval in which there manual operations are performed.This second depression of START button 81 again turns on the RUNNING light emitting diode 85 and commences the automatic sampling procedures determined by the selected program, such auto tic operation being unaffected by any subsequent accidental operation of the START button 81 or of the switches 77, 78 or 80 before completion of all sampling cycles. The following explanation of the programmed operational sequence usumes that switch 78 has been set to provide for large volume samples of 10 pll seeiPig 6 . Initially the program provides a first delay period PAl terminating at timeT1 during which nothing further happens. At time T1 a time sequence of operations terminating at tire T10 commences, which sequence is repeated with the same duration in each subsequent cycle.From time T1 to time T2 period PB , an additional delay is provided e.g. 30 secs until, at time T2 the pump is operated for the period PC e.g. 60 secs to draw a sample solution into each of the six conduits 65 and expel a corresponding volume of fluid from each conduit into the waste gutter or receptacle 55.It will be apparent that half the sample taken into each conduit 65 will be taken immediately before tire TC1 and half immediately after time Tcl where time TC1 is mid way between times T2 and T3 such that TC1 a i T3 T2 . Time TC1 is arranged to correspond to the first sapling time set out in Table I for the program selected by the setting of rotary thumbwbeel switch 77. At time T3 the pump motor is stopped and the arm motor is operated so that during the period PD e.g. 3 secs the bracket 60 and the conduits 64 are brought pivotally from the said second or waste position to said first position in which the six conduit outlets 64 overlie the first six sample cups 54. At time To the period T5 commences during which the pump motor 41 is again operated to discharge into these six cups 54 the samples of fluid drawn into the conduits during period Pc. The period Tz from timeT4 to time T7 is for example 60 secs and, where switch 78 has been set to provide for samples ot 10 ml volume, the pump 67 is run for the whole of this period.Thus the fluid sample discharged into the sample cups 54 during period PE is composed of the one half sample fluid ingested into the conduits 65 during the period Pc immediately before tine TCI and the one half sample fluid ingested into the conduits 65 immediately after the time TCI. At time T7 the pump motor 41 stops and the arm motor 66 starts to run period PF to return pivotally the bracket 60 to the waste position. At the end of period PF e.g. 3 secs after T7 and at time Te the periodPG commences during which turntable motor 74 is actuated such that, via the indexing mechanism 51, the turntable 53 is moved six steps time T8 to 19 during this first cycle.The time allowed for each step is for example 3 secs and the period PG is for example 24 secs to allow for eight such steps to be effected, e.g. on even numbered cycles when switch 80 is in the 6868 state, the two additional indexing steps occurring between times T9 and T10 At time T10 i.e. at the end of period PG the first cycle of operations is concluded and the second cycle commences. The second and each subsequent cycle of operations is precisely the same as the first in sequence and periods PB PC PDw PE PF and PG are each of the same duration. The only difference is that the first delay period referenced PA2 for the second cycle differs from period PAI to take account of the elapsed time between T1 and T10 i.e. the period X, composed of periods PB PC PD PE PF plus pG which transpires in every cycle and during which the above mentioned operations are repeated and to take account of any differences in the sampling times denoted, for the first and second cycles, by Tcland TC2 . With the exemplary time durations given above it will be seen that period E has a duration of 3 minutes and periods Pg and PC are respectively 30 secs. and 60 secs. Therefore with for example program 0 of Table I selected by switch 77, tines TCl and TC2 are respectively 5 minutes and 10 minutes whereby periods PAl andPA2 must be respectively 4 minutes and 2 minutes. If, on the other hano, the switch 78 is set to provide for small volume samples of for example 4 ml, the time periods are arranged such that the ingestion pump period PC is extended and the operation of the arm motor is transferred to occur within the delay period P51 compare Figures 6 and 7 .In other words, the tire periods PD and Pe from time T3 to time T7 are replaced by time periods PE, PL, PM and PN, for example of 18 secs, 3 secs, 24 secs and 18 secs respectively , period PK providing an additional run for the pump to waste, period FL providing for arm movement from the waste position to the cup filling position, period PM providing a run period for the pump motor to effect discharge of fluid samples into the six cups 54, and period PN providing a celay before coamencenent of the period PF in which the arm is returned to the waste position .Thus, as with a iO ml sample volume, the 4 ml samples discharged into the cups 54 during period PM each consist of one half of the fluid ingested into a conduit 65 immediately before tine TCl and one half of the fluid ingested into that conduit 65 immediately after tile TCl. It will be appreciated that, in every case i.e. for each cycle of whatever program or sample volume , the period E is the same, e.g. 3 minutes. Furthermore it will be appreciated that the return movement of frame 59 to the waste position effected during period Pr may be performed after or during the period PG instead of before the period PG as illustrated in Figs 6 and 7. It will be apparent from the circuit of Fig 5 that light emitting diode 42 is on whenever the arm rotor 66 is operating, light emitting diode 83 is on whenever the turntable indexing motor 74 is operating, and that lightemitting diode 84 is on whenever the pump motor 41 is operating. A program for effecting the above de cribed alternative sequences with period p preceding period PG , as well as for providing an audible alarm signal to 8 loudspeaker or buzzer not shown provided in the controller 70, is set out in generalised form below. This program utilises the three pointer registers provided by the microprocessor circuit and stores the appropriate data corresponding to Table I i.e., for each program, the number of cycles and the first delay period PA for each cycle in the ROM in the form of a command table. The program also includes a sub routine, calledSUBROUTINE SEC , that provides for a delay in seconds equal to the number loaded.POGRAMSTEP PROGRAM STEP NUMBER O Start.
