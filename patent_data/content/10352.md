## Description
The invention relates to fiber optic transducers and, in particular, to packaging systems for active semiconductor elements such as Light Emitting Diodes andLight Sensitive Diodes. The packages are optically and mechanically compatible with prior art fiber optic connector systems. Background of the Invention U.S. Patent No. 3,999,837 for a Light TransmittingFiber Bundle Connector describes a system for connecting and disconnecting fiber optic conductor pairs with an acceptable loss level at such an interconnection. The particular configuration described is directed at obtaining good concentricity of and contact between the mated fibers.Prior art means for interfacing the fibers to active elements such as a light source or sensor are believed te be limited to relatively expensive packages which are lab intensive and are subject to breakage or other damage both during the initial assembly process and in use. The inexpensive systems which are available more relatively inefficient in terms of optical coupling between the active element and fiber optic transmission line. Contemporary package designs typically utilize a pigtail optical fiber attached at one end to an optical sink or source. The other end of the pigtail may be fitted with a male connector assembly as shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,999,83 , supra, or with some other suitable interface system for mating the optical fiber to the remainder of a system.U.S. Patent No. 4,108,534 by Noane et al and 4,114,979 byHeldt are also representative of such connecting systems. Brier Disclosure of Shrtcomings of the prior art sev ces are rJjerco the instant invention by mounting the active semîcondu sink or source together with a short length or segment of optical fiber in an integral package which is compatible with one of the existing fiber optic connector system such as those of patent Nos. 3,999,837, 4,108,534 or supra. The integral package and short fiber provides a degree of protection to the fiber active element intercon nection that is not attained in prior art assemblies. The invention provides an integral package which allows easv and low cost placement and replacement of active opto electrical elements in a fiber optics system. The interface between active element and optical fiber is enhanced by means of use of a transparent plastic bonding agent. Small diameter fibers may be accommodated since the integral package provides the necessary protection such fibers demand. Therefore, it is dn object of the invention to provide package for enhanced protection of a semiconductor fiber optic interface. It is another object of the invention to reduce the assembly complexity, thus reducing the cost of an active element fiber optic combination. It is still another object of the invention to provide a rugged opto electric package which is easily placeable or replaceable in opto electrical circuits. These and other objects of the invention will be more readily understood upon reading the Detailed Description of the Invention considered together with the drawings in which FIGURE 1 represents in cross section a first embodiment of the invention, FIGURE 2 shows in cross section a second embodiment the invention, and FIGURE 3 illustrates in cross section a third embodiment of the invention which is especially advantageous for low cost, mass production of the invention. Detailed Description of the Invention Referring first to FIGURE 1, a cross section of one embodiment of the invention may be seen. Enclosure or ferrule member 10 provides an integral mount for header 14 and optical fiber 18. Header 14 carries die 8 which man e either a light emitting or a light sensitive semiconductor device, such as a diode. Bonding wire 24 provides a connection from lead 16 to die 8. Transparent bonding material 20, which may comprise silicone rubber material, is used to provide adherence between optical fiber 18 and the active area of die 8. The silicone rubber material may be General Electric Part No. 261, Silicone Die Coat, fo example. Optical fiber element 18 is preferably adhered to die 8 after header assembly 14 is completed. The assembly comprising header 14 and all of its elements together wit adhered optical fiber 18 is then inserted into ferrule 1Gµ as shown. A thermal setting plastic material, epoxy for. example, is used to fill void 26 to provide good adherence between the elements of the assembly thereby maintaining the elements in fixed spatial relationship, and also to provide the necessary protection for fiber 18. It sho.3 t be noted that the epoxy in void 26 is applied in such a way as to fill the void between header 14 and ferrule 10 as also indicated at point 12. The epoxy material may beHysol Co. Part No. 0S1600 Epoxy, for example. Optical fiber 18 preferably extends beyond surface 22 at the tirde of assembly. Fiber 18 is then cut and polished flush witt surfacd 22 after assembly. While the embodiment of the invention as shown inFIGURE 1 is intended to be coripatible with the connector described in U.S. Patent No 3tt99,837, it is apparent that configurations of compatibility with other Optical fiber 18 of FIGURE 1 is typically 8 mils 0.2 mm. in diameter but can be as smaLl as 3 Li 0.08 mm. or less. Other, larger fiber diameters can be utilized. For example, FIGURE 2 illustrates another embodiment of the invention wherein a larger diameter optical fiber is used. In FIGURE 2 ferrule 30 has a a r inside diameter for accommodating optical fiber 38, which T,ay have a diameter on the order of 40 mils 1.02 mm. . It twill be understood, by one having skill in the fiber optics art, that the fiber diameters of FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 2 r..av or may not include a glass cladding which is utilized to enhance optical transmission characteristics. Generally, core size is dictated by the active area of the semiconductor element. Thick cladding is employed to enable the use of larger internal diameters in, for example, the ferrule of FIGURE 2. This, in turn, provides more accurate concentricity between the hole containing fiber 38 and the mounting hole for header 34, thereby enhancing alignment of fiber 38 and active element 46. The assembly process in this case may correspond to that of the invention of FIGURE 1. Alternatively fiber 38 is installed in ferrule 30 with a small amount of epoxy bonding material not shown . Fiber 38 and ferrule 30 are cut and polished to provide smooth surface 42. A clear plastic such as a transparent epoxy. is then disposed in volume 40 and the header assembly 34 comprising die 46, wire bonds 44 and leads 36 inserted as shown. The epoxy material then fills the void between header 34 and ferrule 30 as shown at 32. FIGURE 3 illustrates an embodiment of the invention which is especially adaptable for high volume production since it lends itself to automated procedures and processes. Die 50 is mounted on die bonding surface 52 which is part of a lead frame comprising leads 54. Leads 0 56 provide electrical connections from die 50 to leads 54.The assembly comprising 50, 52, 54 and 56 is encapsulated in a transparent plastic material 58 by means of injection or transfer molding processes which are well known per se to those skilled in the art. Material 58 is thus in intimate contact with the active surface of die 50 and serves as the optical coupling element. Enclosure or ferrule member 60 is then molded around material 58 as shown in FIGURE 3. Ferrule 60 is preferably an opaque plastic. Portion 62 of material 58 which extends beyond dashed line 64 is cut off and the combination of transparent material 58 and ferrule 60 is polished flush as shown at dashed line 64. This provides a single package enclosing semiconductor active element 50, material 58, i the interface therebetween. All of the individual operations involved in manufacture of such a package may be accomplished utilizing assembly techniques well known in the semiconductor art. Each of the embodiments of the invention as shown wn FIGURES 1, 2 and 3 provide good optical interface bet the active die element and the fiber optic material. The embodiments of FIGURES 1 and 2 provide this interface b means of silicone rubber material 20 and 40, respectively.The interface in the embodiment of FIGURE 3 is inherent 11 the configuration. The close contact provided by thesinterfaces is much desired since interface integrity is important to a low loss system. Each of the embodiments o the invention as shown in FIGURES 1, 2 and 3 may be inserted into the bushing portion of the connector sys t m described in U.S. Patent No. 3,999,837. Of course, the configuration of ferrule 10 of FIGURE 1, ferrule 30 ofFIGURE 2, or ferrule 60 of FIGURE 3 may be configured to accommodate other connector designs. In any case the integral package of the instant invention provides a Liqh quality, relatively ow cost active emiconductor elem snt which may either sense light or r i cal system. The invention provides a low , quality, easily replaceable element for these applications While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes may be made to te present invention from the principles of the invention described above without departing from the spirit and scope whereof as encompassed in the accompanying claims.Therefore it is intended in the appended claims to ccver 11 such equivalent variations as come within the scope C the invention as described.
