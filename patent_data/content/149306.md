## Description
The present invention relates to cladded optical fibers for transmission of electromagnetic energy in the infrared region having a protective coating and to a method for manufacture of such fibers. There has been great interest in the past few years in optical fibers capable of conducting infrared IR energy. The most promising materials are polycrystalline infrared fibers which have been found to be useful as optical waveguides. The most common materials investigated in the prior art are thallium bromo iodide TlBrI, known as KRS 5 , thallium bromide TlBr , silver chloride AgCl , potassium bromide KBr , and potassium chloride KCl . The most common application of waveguides formed from these materials is in conjunction with CO₂ lasers with the fibers used to deliver the 10.6 µm laser energy to remote or otherwise inaccessible locations for heating or for machining. The IR waveguides are also useful for transmitting infrared energy in pyrometry or spectroscopy from a source of heat to remote heat sensitive detectors. There is also considerable interest in using such fibers for long distance communications as an alternative to the more commonly used silica fibers. Perhaps the most promising and useful application of polycrystalline IR fiber waveguides is in surgical procedures. Through the use of very small diameter fibers, from about 75 micrometers µm to 1 or 2 millimeters mm , laser energy may be transmitted into arteries, veins, joints, the eye, and other parts of the body. All living tissues strongly absorb the 10.6 µm energy from the carbon dioxide laser due to the high absorption of the water contained in the tissue and therefore there is great potential for cutting with limited hemostasis and for tissue ablation. Current practical techniques of CO₂ laser energy delivery are limited to direct line of sight or by reflections from mirrors or prisms. Most infrared fiber waveguides have been produced from a billet or preform of the bulk crystal material. The preform is heated and extruded through a suitable die to obtain the fibers. This process results in a polycrystalline form having a grain size which is a function of the temperature, rate of extrusion, and other factors. Both the physical and optical properties of the fibers differ among the materials. Of particular importance is the optical properties of the infrared fibers with respect to the losses therein. Most of the above listed materials have extremely low theoretical losses but the losses actually achieved have generally been much higher than theoretical. In the extruded fibers, scattering due to surface conditions, grain structure and multiphonon absorption appear to be responsible for most of the losses. It is therefore possible to improve the actual losses to approach the theoretical losses by minimizing the scattering loss through improvement of surface quality, reduction of the crystalline grain size, and use of purer starting materials. The state of the prior art in infrared optical fibers is believed to be defined by the following references Harrington ref. 4 studied the scattering losses in single crystal and polycrystalline KCl and KRS 5. At IR wavelengths, the scattering and multiphonon absorption mechanisms were identified as the limiting loss processes. The polycrystalline materials were found to scatter more strongly than the single crystal materials. In reference 8, Harrington reported on efforts to improve losses in IR transmissive crystalline materials including KRS 5, TlBr, AgCl, KBr, and KCl. He notes that the silver and thallium halides have high refraction indices which can present problems in finding suitable cladding for single mode operation, while the alkali halides have reasonable refractive indices but are hygroscopic and have high melting points. The measured losses in IR fibers are very much higher than intrinsic values. A table of losses is provided for 10.6 µm the wavelength of a CO₂ laser energy comparing intrinsic values, bulk material values and fiber material values of the absorption coefficient and the attenuation per meter, as follows The thallium halides have produced fibers with losses close to the bulk values, but poor results have been obtained for KCl fibers. Power densities in a one meter KRS 5 fiber from 2.5 kW cm² to 6.1 kW cm² were reported. Harrington found that extrusion of KCl produced a poor surface quality resulting from friction between the KCl and the extrusion die and therefore abandoned attempts to extrude this material. Sakuragi and others have experimented with IR fibers for conducting the output of CO₂ lasers 10.6 µm energy at high power level. As reported in references 5 7, these workers concluded that a mixed halide fiber such as KRS 5 is superior to the pure halides such as AgCl. An extinction coefficient less than 10 ² cm ¹ could not be obtained for AgCl. They concluded that KRS 5 was a superior material, mechanically, optically and chemically. To reduce losses it is required to minimize anion impurities such as SO₄² , NO₃ and HCO₃ . Also, a good surface finish is necessary to minimize inclusions, cracks and scratches which increase scattering losses and decrease the power damage threshold. For example, reference 5 reported that extrusion of KRS 5 through a diamond wire die resulted in 1 2 µm deep scratches on the fiber surface from microscopic dust in the die. These papers report transmission losses of 0.4 to 0.6 dB m and extinction coefficients of 1.5 x 10 ³ cm ¹ to 9 x 10 ⁴ cm ¹ although bulk KRS 5 was measured at 4 x 10 ⁴ cm ¹, somewhat lower than the value reported by Harrington. Although some of the increase in loss of the extruded fibers is due to scattering loss at the polycrystalline boundaries, it is predicted that the fiber loss can approach the bulk value by reduction of impurities, defects and grain size. The maximum power density reported is 36 kW cm². Optical degradation can occur from mechanical deformation of the fibers. A minimum bending radius of 12 cm was noted for a 1 mm diameter KRS 5 fiber. Sakuragi describes a surgical probe using the 1 mm KRS 5 fiber. The fiber was covered by a loose fitting polymer tube for protection. Commercial KRS 5 fiber products have required bulky protective coatings to protect the fiber, as well as to protect the environment from the toxic KRS 5. This packaging drastically reduces the utility of the fiber by restricting its use to external or open body cavity procedures only. This is due to the inability of such large, inflexible devices to be used in conjunction with an endoscope. Horiba, Inc. Japan formerly offered a KRS 5 fiber having an outer jacket of 10 mm diameter protecting a 1 mm fiber optic. As may be understood from the above references, IR fibres have various critical problems that must be addressed in producing practical devices. The outer surface of the fiber must be highly finished with a minimum of cracks or scratches. Both the alkali halides and thallium halides are hygroscopic. Thus, the fibers require some coating for mechanical protection of the outer surface. Also, a restraint on the minimum bending radius must be provided. To minimize the losses in the fibers, the extrusion process must be such that a very fine grain crystalline structure is realized. The patent to Bendayan, et al ref. 9 notes that attempts have been made to extrude a tight fitting plastic covering onto an IR fiber such as taught by Hawkins in U.S. Patent No. 3,742,107. However, the lateral pressure on the fiber results in microfractures of the fiber surface increasing transmission loss. Bendayan, et al teach the extrusion of a plastic covering over an optical fiber with a clearance of 1 to 10 µm therebetween eliminating the lateral pressure. Reference 10, the Anderson, et al patent, describes a method of extruding a silver bromide IR fiber core having a silver chloride cladding. A coaxial billet is extruded through a diamond die 6 to 18 mil 0.15 to 0.46 mm in diameter. The resulting boundary between fiber core and cladding is rough and poorly defined. See Figure 4 of Anderson. As referred to herein clad or cladding means a coaxial crystalline or polycrystalline layer surrounding a fiber core. As referred to herein window shall mean a window or lens in an infrared optical cable. According to the present invention, there is provided a process of fabricating a low loss cladded halide fiber waveguide for transmission of infrared frequencies, characterized by the steps of Further, the invention provides a cladded optical fiber for transmission of electromagnetic energy in the infrared region of the spectrum, characterised by My invention can thus provide a novel process for extruding a cladded optical polycrystalline fiber that meets the requirements for an IR fibre having a fine grain structure, a smooth surface and a protective covering. It can also provide a novel IR probe structure for the optical fiber that is applicable to use of the fiber in laser beam surgical procedures, remote heat sensing, pyrometry, spectroscopy and laser beam machining. Processes according to the invention require ingots of the halides. I prefer the use of Merck s Optipur grade powdered material. The powder is first vacuum baked in a quartz ampoule. For use, the material is melted. After melting, a single crystal may be grown by the Bridgeman method. I prefer a cylindrical ingot one inch 25.4mm in diameter and 4 to 5 inches 102 to 127 mm in length. Larger ingots , 5 to 6 inches 127 to 152 mm in length, may be used and core drilled or cut and machined to size. The process just described produces a single crystalline ingot with a very low impurity level. A billet core can then be prepared by core drilling, machining or extruding the ingot to form a crystal billet core having a diameter of 3 to 6 mm and a length of 3 to 4 inches 76.2 to 102 mm . Preformed billets of poorer optical quality are commercially available, such as from Harshaw Chemical Co. However, I prefer to grow my own crystals from Optipur grade powered halide. After the billet core is prepared, it is cladded with a compatible material having a lower index of refraction than the waveguiding core portion. The preferred pre extrusion radial thickness of the cladding is between about 1 mm and about 3 mm. The billet core may be cylindrical preform of the desired waveguide halide inserted coaxially in a sleeve member of lower refractive index. After the composite billet is assembled, it may be placed in a thin tube of a non hygroscopic plastics or other polymer material, such as polyethylene, polyvinyl fluoride, nylon, teflon, cellophane, polyvinylidene chloride saran or a similar material which is heat shrunk around the composite billet. Alternatively, the composite billet may simply be wrapped with the polymer material. The preferred radial thickness of polymer is between about 0.03 mm and about 0.09 mm. A heated die block having a cylindrical opening to receive the billet and a suitable die for the desired diameter fiber may be used. If so, the polymer covered billet is inserted in the die block and allowed to come up to a preselected temperature which tends to make the billet and polymer more ductile. A hydraulically or other mechanically operated ram is then inserted in the die block opening in contact with the billet end. Pressure is then applied to the ram forcing the coaxial billet into the die. The softened polymer and halide core and sleeve are extruded into a small halide fibre, preferably of between about 0.075 and about 2.0 mm outside diameter, coated with a thin layer of polymer. A stream of nitrogen gas which has been cooled by liquid nitrogen may be directed at the coated fiber as it leaves the die, quickly cooling the polymer and the halide fiber. The extrusion process forces the softened polymer into continuous intimate contact with the outer surface of the fiber. The polymer serves several important functions. During the extrusion process, the polymer acts as a lubricant, preventing any contact between the die and the fiber. Therefore, the highly finished surface of the billet is not affected by the die or the extrusion process. The continuous intimate polymer coating on the final fiber also acts as a protection preventing deterioration of the fibre due to moisture and atmospheric contaminants. In addition, the polymer protects the fiber from damage when any subsequent mechanical strength member is added. A suitable polymer layer may also be interposed between the billet core and cladding. I have found that this prevents mixing of core and cladding halides during the extrusion process, resulting in a remarkably sharp and well defined core boundary in the extruded fiber. The preferred radial thickness of this polymer layer is between about 0.03 mm and about 0.06 mm. I have found that a quenching step immediately after extrusion results in a fine grain structure in the polycrystalline halide fiber. In the above process, the elimination of scratches or cracks on the fiber surface and the production of a fine grain provides minimum transmission losses and maximum strength in the fiber. To facilitate the use of the fiber, I prefer to form a cable by encasing the polymer coated cladded fiber in a concentric strength member of Teflon a trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemours of Wilmington, DE tetrafluoroethylene polymer, or the like, with a radial thickness ranging from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mm. The strength member may be a tight fitting tube of Teflon or the like, or may be formed as a sheath around the fiber by direct co extrusion onto the polymer coated fiber, by dipping, or by other suitable means of application. Alternatively, the fiber is placed coaxially in a loose fitting tube of the strength member material. The space between the fiber and the strength member can then be completely filled with a liquid epoxy which cures to a high viscosity. The epoxy thus cushions the optical fiber and serves to limit the radius of curvature of the fiber to a safe value. A window, transparent to IR, may be disposed at the end of the cable which seals the end of the fiber from the atmosphere. The opposite end of the cable may have an attached connector for connecting such opposite end to the output of a laser with or without an IR window. It may also be noted that my polymer coating is advantageous when poisonous halides are utilised as IR fibers to prevent pollution of the environment or danger in handling. My invention can therefore provide a method for manufacture of cladded infrared optical fibers having a protective polymer coating. My invention can also provide Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, a longitudinal sectional view of a cylindrical billet 15 in accordance with my method for fabricating an infrared optical fiber is shown. Although the dimensions of the billet are not critical, I prefer to use a cylindrical preform about 3 12 mm in diameter by about 80 100 mm in length. The material forming billet core 10 may be thallium halide, an alkali metal halide, or a silver halide, and is preferably between about 3 mm and about 6 mm in diameter before extrusion. To produce a fiber which will conduct electromagnetic energy falling within the infrared portion of the spectrum, various combinations of metal cations and anions may be utilized. Very useful and widely used materials are the thallium halides in which thallium serves as the cation and bromine, chlorine, and iodine serve as the anions, either individually or in combinations. Thallium bromo iodide, known commerically as KRS 5, is a popular material for IR fibers. Thallium bromo iodo chloride, known commercially as KRS 6, is also an effective material. Alkali metal halides are suitable materials in which the cation may be lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, or cesium with chlorine, bromine, iodine, or fluorine useful as the anion. Of the possible combinations, sodium and potassium are the most widely used cations with chlorine and bromine the most popular anions. Similarly, chlorine, bromine and iodine may supply anions to silver to produce useful silver salts. I prefer the following cations sodium, potassium, cesium, silver and thallium. I prefer the following anions fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. The preferred halides include NaCl, KCl, AgCl, TlCl, KBr, AgBr, TlBr, CsI, CsBr, KRS 5, and KRS 6. Billet core 10 is surrounded by coaxial sleeve 8 which forms the cladding layer in the extruded fiber. Coaxial sleeve 8 preferably has a radial thickness of between about 1 mm and about 3 mm. The material forming sleeve 8 may be thallium halide, an alkali halide, or a silver halide, but must be selected so as to have a lower index of refraction than the material forming the billet core. In preparing a billet 15 as in Figure 1, I prefer the use of Merck s Optipur grade or other pure grade raw materials for both billet core and sleeve which have a very low concentration of impurities. The halide material can be obtained as a powder or in the form of a preform billet. The halide powder is vacuum baked in a quartz ampoule to remove impurities, and then melted. Normally, when the powdered material is melted, it solidifies as the polycrystalline form of the material. However, a Bridgeman growth process may be used to generate a single large crystal in the anion environment and thereby obtain a highly purified single crystalline ingot. P.W. Bridgeman, Proc. Am. Acad. Arts Sci., Sleeve 8 is prepared in the same manner as billet core 10. The sleeve 8 is further core drilled to accept billet core 10, which is inserted therein. The billet core 10 of the prepared material should be inspected to determine that the side surfaces are perfectly smooth with no cracks, voids, or scratches. The side sur surfaces of sleeve 8 should be inspected, and polished if necessary. The billet assembled from core 10 and sleeve 8 is wrapped with a plastic or other polymer film material to form a polymer layer 12. The final billet is identified generally by 15. The polymer may be polyethylene, mylar, Teflon, polyamide, polyvinyl fluroide, polyvinylidene chloride saran , a cellulose material such as cellophane, or other available polymer film having the properties hereinafter set forth. Non hygroscopic materials are preferred. In selecting the polymer film, it is preferable to select a film that will be ductile in the range of extrusion temperatures used for extruding billet core 10 and sleeve 8. The film must be ductile enough in comparison to the core and sleeve materials to maintain the proper extrusion ratio. The melting point of the film must be above the extrusion temperature of the billet. The film must be ductile at the extrusion temperature of the billet. The amount of polymer film 12 covering the billet is not critical. A wrapping radial thickness of 0.03 0.09 mm may be used. Of greater importance than wrapping radial thickness is ensuring that there are no air pockets between the polymer film and the sleeve 8. Referring to Figure 2, a typical wrapping procedure is illustrated. Here, polymer film 12 is wrapped twice around sleeve 8 to form two complete turns. The joint formed at the points of overlapping of the film ends may tend to produce small air pockets along the line shown at point 11. To overcome this problem, a small tool such as a soldering iron, burnishing tool, or the like may be used to apply heat and or pressure indicated by arrow A along the seam at point 11 to force any entrapped air out at the ends of the billet 15. The wrapping operation must also be performed in a very clean, dust free environment since fine dust particles or the like on the surface of sleeve 8 may result in damage to the outer surface of the resulting fiber which will increase scatttering losses in the final fiber. As an alternative to wrapping the polymer material 12 around the assembled billet, the billet may be inserted into a cylindrical tube of the polymer which is heat shrunk around the billet. This technique prevents voids occurring between film 12 and the billet, a well as providing a more uniform coating. Figure 3 shows a cross sectional view of a billet 15 prepared in this fashion. To extrude a core clad polymer fiber in accordance with my invention, a billet 15 is inserted in bore 17 and ram 16 is installed as shown in Figure 4. The heater 20 is then energized. When block 18 is at the selected operating temperature, pressure P is applied to ram 16 by a suitable means not shown, such as a motor driven screw or a hydraulic cylinder. The pre selected temperature should be sufficient to cause material 10 and polymer 12 to become ductile. The pressure from ram 16 on billet 15 will cause coated fiber 22 to be extruded from die 14. I use a diamond wire die. As fiber 22 issues from die 14, it will, of course, be at the extrusion temperature. I have determined experimentally that a rapid quenching or cooling of the fiber 22 will significantly reduce the final grain size. To this end, I provide a tube 27 having a heat barrier 23 at its input end. As may be noted from the drawing, fiber 22 extends through a central opening in heat barrier 23. A source of nitrogen gas N₂ delivers the gas to cooling tube 29 which is immersed in a container 25 of liquid nitrogen 35 which is at a temperature of about 79 K 194 C or less. The nitrogen gas will flow through inlet 36, as indicated by the flow arrows, and will quickly chill the extruded fiber 22, greatly reducing the grain size. Heat barrier 23 prevents the cooling gas from affecting the material in the die during the extrusion process. In some materials, stresses are induced during high pressure extrusion which cause increased losses, and thus aging. By exposing the fiber to an annealing process, those stresses are relieved and the initial low loss characteristics are maintained. Therefore, I have provided a tempering chamber not shown containing heating elements to relieve the stresses in the fiber 22. Advantageously, I have found that the above described extrusion process results in a very fine grain cladded halide fiber of higher tensile strength having a tight fitting polymer external coating in which the surface area of the fiber is extremely smooth with few microfractures, scratches, or voids therein. In contrast to the extrusion of KRS 5 as taught by the prior art which produces a minimum grain size of 3 4 µm, I achieve a grain size of about 1 µm in my plastic coated cladded fiber 22. In extruding cladded fibers of the alkali metal halides, temperatures between about 120 C and about 350 C may be used, with pressures ranging between about 25,000 psi 172 MPa and about 50,000 psi 345 MPa . It is believed that extrusion temperatures as low as room temperature may be used. I have found that the optimum extrusion temperature is 170 C 20 , at a pressure of approximately 30,000 psi 207 MPa . The quenching step does not appear to be necessary with the alkali halides. Although the alkali halides are known to be highly hygroscopic and more brittle than the thallium halides, my plastic coated alkali halide fibers have been exposed to humid environments with little deterioration in their optical characteristics being noted. In addition, no power damage threshold has been as yet determined, the fibers withstanding 25 kilowatts per square centimeter, the limit of my available test equipment. The polymer coating 12 counteracts the hygroscopicity of these fibers. Harrington reports in Reference 8 a power damage threshold for unclad KRS 5 fibers extruded at 200 350 C of 6.1 kW cm², with a transmission loss of 0.4 dB m at 10.6 µm, or an absorption loss of 9.2 x 10 ⁴ cm ¹. Thus, it is believed that cladded thalium halide fibers may be extruded with a polymer coating according to the present invention using the same temperatures. Chen et al in Reference 1 report room temperature extrusion of unclad silver halide fibers. It is believed that cladded silver halide polymer coated fibers may be extruded at or near room temperature according to the present invention. The rate of extrusion for fine grain fiber can be expected to be in excess of 2 meters per hour. Ideally, extrusion for all fibers according to the present invention is performed at room temperature. In the prior art, it has been found that extruding at lower temperatures will produce a finer grain structure. However, some halides are not extrudable at room temperature because of a lack of ductility or inordinate extrusion pressure requirements. In Figure 5, a partial longitudinal sectional view of another cylindrical billet 21 in accordance with my method for fabricating an infrared optical fiber is shown. Billet 21 is similar to billet 15 Fig. 3 but contains an additionaly inner polymer film layer 31 sandwiched at the interface between core 13 and sleeve 24. Sleeve 24 is comparable to coaxial sleeve 8 and may be thallium halide, an alkali metal halide or silver halide having a lower index of refraction than core 13. Inner film layer 31 is formed by inserting billet core 13 into a tube of appropriate polymer which is heat shrunk around the billet core. Alternatively, billet core 13 may be wrapped with a polymer film prior to insertion into sleeve 24. As a further alternative, a suitable polymer coated billet core may be prepared directly from an ingot of the core material, by coextruding the ingot and polymer. This will provide a thin uniform polymer film around the billet core 13. Polymer film 19 is heat shrunk around the outer surface of sleeve 24 as in Figure 3 to form an outer polymer coating. Alternatively, polymer film 19 may be formed by wrapping as in Figure 2. Polymer film 19 in Figure 5 should conform to the physical requirements of polymer film 12 in Figures 1 3, i.e., it should be non hygroscopic and have a melting point above the extrusion temperature of the billet, and be ductile at the extrusion temperature of the billet. Polymer film 19 may have a radial thickness of between about 0.03 mm and about 0.09 mm. Inner polymer film 31 ideally is optically transparent at the required wavelength. The thickness of polymer film 31 is determined by two opposing considerations. The film 31 should be sufficiently thick to prevent mixing of core and cladding during the extrusion process, yet at the same time it must not be so thick as to result in appreciable absorption of transmitted infrared radiation. Greater thicknesses of relatively low absorbing polymers such as cellophane can be tolerated, whereas the same thickness of a higher absorbing material would result in undesirable absorption. This polymer film 31 can be a thin absorbing material for applications of the fiber that do not require long lengths, such as laser surgery. Like the outer polymer film, the inner film 31 must be ductile at billet extrusion temperatures. Inner polymer film 31 may be selected from the same polymer materials useful for the outer polymer film 19. It is not necessary, however, that inner polymer film 31 be non hygroscopic. Billet 21 is extruded in the apparatus of Figure 4 to produce the fiber shown in end view in Figure 6. For optimum results, the composite billet is pre compacted as follows. The billet core is preferably 1 16 inch 1.6 mm shorter in length than the cladding sleeve. The composite billet is first placed in an extrusion press containing a blanked extrusion die, and the temperature is rapidly increased to about 200 C for 1 2 minutes at about 20,000 psi 138 MPa . The blanked die is then replaced with an appropriate extrusion die, and the fiber is extruded at the appropriate temperature. The pre compaction step results in a composite billet wherein the core and cladding sleeve are concentric with no gaps in polymer film 31. Having described processes exemplifying my invention, the construction of an infrared optical cable or conduit utilizing my coated fibers will be described. Turning to Figure 7, a longitudinal section of the distal end portion of the cable 40 is shown. An extruded fiber 22 having a polycrystalline core 10 , cladding 8 and polymer coating 12 is shown in longitudinal section concentric with a strength member 26. Strength member 26 may be formed from Teflon tubing, thin walled metal tubing, or other type of flexible tubing. The space between coated fiber 22 and the inside of strength member 26 is completely filled with an epoxy type material 30. Although many types of epoxy are available which will be suitable for various purposes, I prefer a member of Epoxy Technology Series 300 Epoxy Technology, Inc. , such as Epoxy 310, which is prepared as a liquid and may be injected into the sheath 26 easily and permitted to cure. After curing, this epoxy is in a very viscous semi solid form which permits the cable or conduit to be curved as required and cushions the suspended coated fiber 22 and provides additional mechanical damage protection. At the distal end of the cable, an IR window 28 may be installed and sealed therein. Window 28 may be zinc selenide, zinc sulfide, germanium, diamond, or other IR transparent materials depending upon the wavelength desired. Window 28 effectively seals the output end 38 of IR fiber 22 to prevent damage thereto, absorption of moisture or other contaminants. For toxic fibers, the window 28 also provides protection to the environment from the fiber. For some applications of the cable, such as thermal sensing the window may be dispensed with. Figure 8 is a longitudinal section of the distal end of another cable embodiment 50. An extruded fiber 42, similar to the fiber shown in Figure 6, and having a polycrystalline core 13 , inner polymer film 31 , cladding 24 , and outer polymer film 19 is shown in longitudinal section, concentrically surrounded by strength member 46. Strength member 46 may be a tube of Teflon or other like polymer. Strength member 46 may also comprise a thin walled metal tube. Strength member 46 is preferably formed around fiber 42 by a concentric extrusion process following extrusion of fiber 42. The material and thickness of strength member 46 can be altered to meet the requirements of the application. Considerations for determining material and thickness include, for example, flexibility requirements, minimum bend radius, and maximum outside diameter permissible in a particular application, i.e., the ability of the cable to fit into the available working space. An IR window 28 similar to the window 28 in Fig. 7 may be attached to one end of strength member 46 by means of an adhesive 48, or by ultrasonic fusion or other conventional sealing techniques. The attachment means chosen is dependent on the material used for strength member 46 and the application. Where short semi rigid segments of cable are needed, cable 50 may be placed in a jacket 52 of metal or polymer tubing which may be filled with an approximate cushioning material. Window 28 may be held in place by jacket 52, as shown in Fig. 8. Metal tubing is appropriate in applications where the bend radius experienced by the cable is not so severe as to cause crimping of the tube. I have achieved a bend radius of less than 50 mm with a stainless steel tube of 1.24 mm outer diameter and radial wall thickness of 0.14 mm. A typical IR transmission cable 40 is shown in perspective view in Figure 9 with portions cut away to show an alternative construction. A connector 34 is provided at the proximal end which may connect to the output of a CO₂ laser as an example. An Amphenol type 905 117 xxxx Bunker Ramo precision fiber optic connector or an Optical Fiber Technologies, Inc. OFTI200 S series fiber connector is well suited for this use. The connector may contain a window. The cable portion from plug 34 toward the distal end to a point indicated by B has the same construction as shown in Figure 7, except for the absence of window 28. However, portion C of cable 40 between point B and the distal end may advantageously utilize a different filling material than the viscous epoxy 30 previously discussed. Filling material 32, which may also be an epoxy, is selected to cure to a rigid condition. Suitable rigid curing materials include, for example, Epoxy 337 Tra Bond F110 low viscosity adhesive or F230 low viscosity high temperature adhesive Tra Con, Inc. . Therefore, portion C of cable 40 may be rigid. This construction is useful where cable 40 is used for machining, for transmitting heat energy from the distal end for remote temperature measurements, or for surgery where a rigid segment is required. A cable, lacking the portion designated C, in which the viscous type filler 30 is used throughout, is useful for surgical applications where the conduit may be inserted into arteries, endoscopes or the like. Suitable flexible curing materials in addition to Epoxy 310 include, for example, Silastic 732 RTV Dow Corning and Tra Cast F311 which cures to semi flexibility. The length of cable 40 is, of course, selected as a function of the application, but may vary from a fraction of a meter to several meters in length. The diameter is also variable with the application. I have produced optical fibers in accordance with my invention having diameters from 0.4mm to 1mm. I expect to produce fibers having diameters ranging between 75 µm to 2mm. Thus, the outside diameter of cable 40 may be in the range of 0.1mm to 3mm. As may now be recognized, such cables may be fabricated which are insertable through passages in available medical instruments such as endoscopes, cystoscopes, and other similar instruments. Thus, the fiber of my invention can be used in conjunction with presently available instruments which have optical fibers or other light conduit means in the visible light range for illumination and viewing of the operative portion of the instrument. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following non limiting examples. A three part cylindrical preform billet was prepared having a 3mm diameter KBr core n 1.52 and a 6mm outer diameter KCl sleeve n 1.45 . Saran was wrapped around the sleeve to a thickness of 0.076mm. Extrusion was carried out at about 180 C and 33,000 psi 228 MPa to form a cladded fiber of 0.6mm outside diameter. A three part cylindrical preform billet was prepared having a 3mm diameter NaCl core n 1.49 and a 6mm outer diameter KCl sleeve n 1.45 . Saran was wrapped around the sleeve as in Example 1 to a thickness of 0.076mm. Extrusion was carried out at approximately 220 C and approximately 30,000 psi 207 MPa to form a fiber of 0.6mm outside diameter. A four part cylindrical preform billet was prepared having a 3mm diameter KBr core and 6mm outer diameter KCl sleeve between which was sandwiched a layer of 0.038mm thickness saran wrapped to a thickness of between about 0.038 to about 0.076mm. Saran was also wrapped around the sleeve as in Example 1 to a thickness of 0.076mm. Extrusion was carried out at approximately 200 C and approximately 30,000 psi 207 MPa to form a fiber of 0.6 mm outside diameter. Other possible combinations of halides useful for core and cladding materials in both core polymer clad polymer or core clad polymer fibers are set forth in Table I. Pairing of core and cladding halides is dictated by melting point and index of refraction. The core halide must have an index of refraction greater than the clad halide. Core and clad halides should melt at roughly similar temperatures. Other combinations of halides are possible, yielding fibers having properties similar to fibers formed from the combinations of halides listed above. Properties of the resulting fiber which will vary according to the choice of halide include flexibility, transmission bandwidth, cost, toxicity, melting point, etc. Where flexibility is desired, softer halide materials may be used. Transmission bandwidths in µm are reported in the literature. Examples for certain core materials are as follows AgBr, 0.5 25 µm CsBr, 0.25 35 µm KRS 5, 2 40 µm. Where fibers are used in high power applications, or in areas of high temperatures, e.g. laser surgery, high melting point materials are desireable. Although I have described my invention with reference to the preferred embodiment, many varitions will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Optical fiber are traditionally circular in cross section. However, other cross sectional forms may be useful in specific applications. Accordingly, the billet used to extrude the fibers and the extrusion die opening may be rectangular, hexagonal or other special shape. Such variations are to be considered within the invention. The steps necessary to practice my invention may be summarized as follows For certain of the halide compounds, an improvement in grain size is achieved by the additional step of rapidly cooling the extruded fiber as it issues from the die. The steps in forming the billet may also advantageously include
