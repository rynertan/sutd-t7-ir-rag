# A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING LOW VISCOSITY CURABLE POLYESTER RESIN COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing low viscosi ty curable polyester resin compositions, which compositions contain a mixture of i an unsaturated ester terminally modified with a reactive olefin such as dicyclopentadiene or other Diels Alder adducts of cyclopentadiene with an olefinic or acetylenic hydrocarbon or alkylated derivative thereof and ii a polymeriz able ethylenically unsaturated monomer which serves to cross link the unsaturated ester to a thermoset product. Fiber reinforced thermoset articles can be produced from these curable polyester resin compositions.
