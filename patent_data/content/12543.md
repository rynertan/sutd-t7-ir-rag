## Description
TITLEACETALS AND KETALS, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE AS EMOLLIENTS Slis invention relates to certain acetals and ketals which have emollient properties and to compositions containing such acetals or ketals. According to the present invention there is provided an emollient comprising an acetal or a ketal of a fatty aliphatic aldehyde or ketone having a total of from 7 to 30 carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain or chains, and more especially from 13 to 30 carbon atoms. The acetal or ketal may be cyclic or linear, that is it may be derived from an alcohol, R3 OH, or a polyol containing at least two OR groups, R4 OH 2, in which and R4 have the meanings hereinafter defined. Cyclic acetals and ketals, containing 5 membered 1 ,3 dioxolane and 6 membered 1 ,3 dioxane rings and having the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is a fatty aliphatic chain and R2 is H or a fatty aliphatic chain, provided the sum of the carbon atoms in R1 and R2 together is from 13 to 30, and R4 is an alkylene chain which is optionally substituted with for example hydroxy, alkoxy, acyloxy or polyalkyleneoxy groups, have been found to have particularly valuable emollient properties. The aliphatic chains, such as R1 or R2, preferably contain from 8 to 20 carbon atoms and examples include alkyl groups containing 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 carbon atoms which groups may be straight chain or branched.An especially preferred species of R1, when R2 is H, comprises a mixture of C12 and C14 alkyl groups. It is further preferred that each of these C12 and C14 alkyl groups comprises a mixture of straight and branched chains, particularly a branched chains. Suitable aldehydes for use in preparing acetals according to the present invention are conveniently prepared from olefines, especially a olefins, by the oxo process, i.e. hydrocarbonylation of the double bonded carbon atoms.An especially preferred oxo aldehyde, prepared from mixedC12 and C14 a olefines, comprises a 70 30 mixture ofC12 and C14 alkyl chains approximately 50 of which are straight and 50 are branched. A specific class of cyclic acetals or ketals, especially the former, having valuable emollient properties, is the class derived from a fatty aliphatic aldehyde or ketone and a lower alkylene glycol, such as ethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, 1h2 propanediol and 2 ,2 dimethyl 1 ,3 propanediol. Especially preferred emollients of this class have the following structures EMI3.1 wherein R1 is the fatty aliphatic chain of the aldehyde as hereinbefore defined and particularly the oxoaldehyde derived from the mixed C12 and C14 o olefine. Throughout this specification the terms lower alkyl and lower alkylene refer to groups containing up to 5 carbon atoms. The above class of cyclic acetal or ketal is made by reacting the appropriate aldehyde or ketones or mixed aldehydes or ketones with the appropriate diol, preferably in the presence of an acid catalyst, or may alternatively be made by what may be described as an acetal or ketal interchange reaction using the diol and for example the di lower alkyl , for example dimethyl, acetal or ketal of the aldehyde or ketone. A further class of cyclic acetal or ketal is that derived from a polyol containing more than two hydroxyl groups, examples of such polyols include glycerol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, sorbitan and hexane triol. When, for example, glycerol is reacted with an aldehyde, R1CKO, there is formed a cyclic acetal which comprises a mixture of compounds having the formulae EMI4.1 the proportion of which can be varied in a known mmzrler by varying the reaction conditions. Cyclic acetals or ketals of this class, useful as emollients, may optionally be alkoxylated with, for example, ethylene or propylene oxide to give a chain of polyalkyleneoxy groups on the free hydroxyl groups.The number of alkyleneoxy groups introduced in this way is preferably from. 1 to 20. The free hydroxy groups may also be acylated or alkylated. Examples of suitable acyl groups are acetyl, butyryl, dodecanoyl, stearoyl and oleoyl and of suitable alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl dodecyl, tridecyl, hexadecyl and octadecyl or mixtures of these. If polyols containing 4 or more hydroxy groups are employed there is the possibility of forming a double acetal or ketal by reaction of two molecules of the aldehyde or ketone with each molecule of the polyol. An example of such a double acetal is EMI5.1 derived from the aldehyde R1CHO and pentaerythritol, where has the meaning hereinbefore defined. This further class of cyclic acetals or ketals may be prepared by the methods outlined hereinbefore. A class of linear acetals or ketals which are derived from fatty aliphatic aldehydes or ketones and have emollient properties are those of the formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as hereinbefore defined and P3 is an alkyl radical of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms or an alkyl terminated polyalkoxy chain, e.g. CmH2mO nR6 m 2mn6 wherein R6 is lower alkyl, m is 2, 3, 4 or 5 and n is an average of from 1 to 20. The radicals R3 may be straight chain or branched and examples include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, octyl and cetyl. Such acetals or ketals may be made by the method hereinbefore described using the appropriate aldehyde or ketone and at least two molecular equivalents of the appropriate hydroxy compound, e.g. an alcohol. When an aldehyde or ketone is reacted with an alcohol or polyol the water formed can be removed by distillation, vacuum stripping or by the use of an entraining solvent or any known methods acetals and ketals of the present invention are su4ta 1e for inccrporation in a wide variety of emollient containing compositions, for example cosmetic formulations used for application to the skin.Thus they may be incorporated in creams and lotions for hair and skin care, astringents, cleansers, shaving aids, after shaves, sum tan preparations, antiperspirants, deodorants, manicure, pedicure and lotion specialities, pigmented make ups lipsticks, shampoo and bath specialities and light duty household cleansing agents which come into contact with tht skis. they may be used in 8dmixtus 2 wi th other materials having emollient properties. Thus as a further feature of the invention there is provided an emollient composition for application to the skin, or for use in cosmetics. in toiletries or in domestic cleansing preparations wherein there is present an acetal or ketal as hereinbefore defined.
