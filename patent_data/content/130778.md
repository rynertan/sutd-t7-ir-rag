# Systems and components for detecting electromagnetic radiation and displaying images produced thereby.

## Abstract
There is provided a system for detecting electromagnetic radiation which comprises imaging means 4 in a first housing 2 , a first rotatable base element 12 carrying an array 22 of input elements 76 which, when rotating together with this base define a surface on which the image is disposed. Rotation of the base element 12 causes the input elements 76 to scan the image, each scanned image point being converted into a video signal which, via transmission and coupling means is fed to image recording and or displaying means.
