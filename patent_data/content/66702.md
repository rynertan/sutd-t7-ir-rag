# Blood collector.

## Abstract
A blood collector comprisng a collection container in the form of a tube having a forward end adapted for drawing of blood into the container and an opened rear end, a closure unit adapted for closing the opened rear end of the collection container, and a mechanism for allowing passage of air when blood is flowing into said container and preventing passage of air and blood when said container is filled with blood, said mechanism having a filter member containing water insoluble but water swellable polymeric material and provided to at least the contact portion of the closure member with collected blood. Air contained in the blood collecting space of the collection container is expelled through the valving element by the collected blood which rises to a desired level for expelling air from said space practically completely. As the clood contacts the water insoluble but water swellable high polymeric material contained in the valving element, the material is swollen into gel body to block the air passage in the valving element connecting to outside of the collector. Thus blood analysis may be effected without influences by outside air and air otherwise contained in the blood collecting space.
