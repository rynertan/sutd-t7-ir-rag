# Fuel control system for a gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A fuel control system includes a flow line 16 along which fuel flows to an engine. A relief valve 20 is responsive to an increase in pressure in the flow line 16 to spill fuel to a return line 24 . The relief valve 20 is also responsive to a servo pressure in a chamber 22 . A control valve communicates with the chamber 22 through a line 25 and a port 26 , and is responsive to an increase in engine speed above a predetermined level to reduce the servo pressure in the chamber 22 and thereby to increase spill flow. Spill flow is limited by closure of the port 26 when the relief valve 20 is partly open. A further valve 27 is electrically operable to vent the servo pressure to the return line 24 to effect shut down of the engine.
