# Coupler device for fluid systems.

## Abstract
A rigid mount, breakaway, quick coupler for fluid inter connection includes a spring activated mechanical stop 54 to prevent flow checking. The flow check stop 54 is supported in a cross bore in a movable inner body member 12 of the coupler and co operates with a ramp surface 18 of a housing 11 to position the flow check stop 54 in an aligned position or a laterally displaced position with respect to an axially movable, flow checking valve pin 48 , thereby respectively to prevent or allow movement of the flow checking valve pin 48 .
