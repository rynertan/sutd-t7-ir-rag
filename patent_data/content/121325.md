# Improvements in or relating to battery charging.

## Abstract
A battery charger comprises a power supply 6 for supply ing current pulses to a battery 71 to be charged. A micro processor 3 receives from an analog to digital converter 20 codes representing the voltage between the battery terminals with the battery off load between charging pulses and monitors the ratio of the voltage difference V₃ V₅ during a first period following a charging pulse to the voltage differ ence V₁₀ V₁₂ over a second period following the charging pulse, with the second period ending after the beginning of the first period. The value of this ratio reaches a peak value and then declines, and the microprocessor determines when the value of the ratio falls below a peak value thereof by a predetermined amount to terminate fast charging of the bat tery, after which the battery may be removed or may remain on a trickle charge. An accurate, reliable, and consistent determination of completion of charging of sealed nickel cadmium batteries is thus provided.
