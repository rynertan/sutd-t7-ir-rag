# SOLID ELECTROLYTE CELL

## Abstract
A solid electrolyte cell has an anodic active material layer 14 which includes a charge transfer complex and a polymeric compound in which the charge transfer complex is dispersed. The charge transfer complex contains a certain type of naph thalene or tetracene derivative as an electron donor and iodine as an electron acceptor. A cathodic active material layer 16 including a light metal is formed in contact with the anodic active material layer 14 . A solid electrolyte layer 22 is formed in situ at the interface between the anodic active material layer 14 and the cathodic active material layer 16 by the reaction between the iodine and the light metal.
