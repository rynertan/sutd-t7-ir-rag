## Description
COLUMN LINE POWERED STATIC RAM CELLBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is concerned with random access memories of the type fabricated on a monolithic semiconductor chip using insulated gate semiconductor fieldeffect transistor technology, and more particularly relates to an improved structural layout for the principal components of each cell of an integrated circuit memory.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Large scale integration LSI techniques have brought about the construction of large arrays of binary storage elements on a single chip of silicon These storage cells, typically using MOS technology, consist of multi component circuits in a conventional bistable configuration. The immediate advantages of such semiconductor storage devices are the high packing density and low power requirements The insulated gate MOS transistor has served well in this application area since it requires less substrate area thereby increasing the packing density and operates at very low power levels. A well known memory cell circuit arrangement which utilizes insulated gate MOS field effect transistors is the cross coupled inverter stage as disclosed in U. S. Patent 3,967,252. In that arrangement the gates of a pair of insulated gate MOS field effect transistors are cross coupled to a true data node, referred to as the DATA node, and a complementary data node, commonly designated as the DATA node. Binary information stored within the cell is maintained by impedance means which are connected to the data nodes to maintain the potential at the gate of the transistors at a predetermined level which corresponds to the logic content of the cell. In the static random access memory cells shown in U. S. Patent 3,967,252, there are two cross coupled inverters comprising two load devices and four transistors In an effort to minimize the substrate area required for a given number of memory cells, the two load devices in the static cell of each inverter have been fabricated as an integral portion of a polycrystalline silicon strip which interconnects a common drain supply node with a data node as disclosed and claimed in United StatesPatent No. 4,125,854, and assigned to a common assignee.United States Patent 4,125,854 is incorporated herein by reference. There remains considerable interest in minimizing the dimensions of the cell structure of integrated circuit memories to provide improved performance and higher packing density. One prior art approach for minimizing the dimensions of a conventional cross coupled inverter stage is illustrated in Figure 3 of the drawing shown in UnitedStates Patent No. 4,125,854. In that arrangement, shared diffusion regions interconnect the principal components of the cell to corresponding components of adjacent cells in the same row or in the same column.Also, a pair of cells in a single column are energized from a common drain supply node. An object of the application issued as United States Patent No. 4,125,854 is to provide an improved structural layout for the principal components of each cell so that the shared diffusion regions and the common power supply nodes may be utilized more efficiently. A related object of the present invention is to delete one of the power supply nodes found in all static memory cells by connecting the resistors fabricated as an integral part of the poly i.e. polysilicon interconnect to the data column lines rather than to a VDD line, allowing deletion of that VDD line running through the cell and thus allowing substantial reduction in each cell area.

The structure as disclosed herein may be fabricated on a single semiconductor chip and is primarily intended for such fabrication. Referring now to FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 3 of the drawings, a portion of a random access memory which utilizes circuitry constructed according to the teachings of the present invention is illustrated. InFIGURE 1, a portion of a random access memory includes a plurality of static memory cells 10 which are part of an array of many such cells arranged in rows and columns in the conventional manner. The memory cells 10 are disposed in separate columns and accordingly connected to separate complementary data buses D1, D1 and D2, D2. Since the memory cells are disposed in separate rows, the rows are addressed or enabled by separate row address lines RA1 and RA2, respectively. The row address line RA1 enables all the memory cells in a second row. RA1 and RA2 are mutually exclusive in that only one row of memory cells is selected at one time. A sense amplifier is indicated generally by the reference numeral 12 and is connected to the output of each of the columns. The sense amp 12 may be of any conventional type, for example, that which is disclosed and claimed by U. S. Patent 3,967,252. Write control circuits not shown may be connected to drive the column buses during a write cycle in the conventional manner. Column enable means not shown may be provided to connect different pairs of column buses to a single sense amp, or a separate sense amp may be provided for eaeh pair of column buses. One of the main differences in allowing implementation of this proposed new cell is that the write control circuits used must be different than those in the conventional manner in the sense that when writing the memory cell, any given DATA or DATA line must be held low in the write mode for a small percentage of the duty cycle. Namely, the DATA andDATA lines would normally be held high near VDD, the positive supply voltage, and during the write mode, one would be briefly brought low, rather than indefinitely brought low, as on a conventional write circuit.This is commonly referred to in the art as pulsing the data or DATA lines when attempting to write or input data to a selected cell. If the data andDATA lines are brought low, for example, for 50 nanoseconds, and the internal time constant on node 1 and node 2 is on the order of a millisecond due to the use of very high valued resistors such that the time constant ofR1 times capacitance on node 1 is very long compared with the time that the DATA or DATA lines are brought low , then the nonselected cells will not be affected by the writing of the selected cell in the memory matrix. An electrical schematic diagram of the memory cell 10 is illustrated in FIGURES 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the drawings. The binary memory cell 10 comprises first and second complementary data input nodes D and D DATA and DATA which provide a direct current impedance path and a relatively higher direct current impedance path corresponding to each binary logic state. First and second impedance means R1 and R2 electrically connect a source of current to the internal data nodes 1 and 2 from the column lines D and D which are held high, near VDD in voltage, by the sense amps. This provides a means of continuous power allowing the cells to be static in the sense that nonoperation of the cells or nonexercising non refreshing of the cells will result in the cells retaining the previously written data, without a need for refreshing the cells periodically.This characterizes a static cell as compared to a dynamic cell. The structure of the impedance means R1 and R2 is described in detail in United States Patent No. 4,125,854, which patent is hereby incorporated by reference. The memory cell 10 also includes a pair of cross coupled insulated gate field effect data storage transistors Q1 and Q2, respectively, and are connected by enabling transistors Q3 and Q4 that are connected to the corresponding row of address lines RA. The channel between the drain and source terminals of transistors Q1 and Q2 electrically connect nodes 1 and 2 to a source node Vss when conducting. In the operation of the cells of FIGURES 3, 4 and 5, the row address line RA is low logic 0 so that the enabling transistors Q3 and Q4 of the memory cell 10 which are connected to the row address line RA are turned off. This allows the column lines D and D to have a voltage level substantially equal to VDD, because there are no current paths to the source voltage Vss other than through the very high valued resistors R1 andR2. In a typical circuit, VDD may be five 5 volts, in which case the column lines D and D would be about five volts. In this state, current will flow through the column lines D and or D into the standby resistors R1 andR2 of each cell respectively in which cell load resistors are connected to that respective D DATA or D DATA line. On a given column line, one half of the cells are connected to the DATA line as represented in FIGURE 3 , and the other half of the cells are connected to the DATA line as represented in FIGURE 4 , to equalize the standby current from the D andD lines. Assume that a logic 0 has been stored in the memory cell 10 so that the transistor Q2 is turned off and data node D is substantially atVDD Then when the row address line RA goes high, that is, is raised to a bias potential corresponding to a logic 1 , the memory cell 10 is selected by the turn on of transistors Q3 and Q4. This results in a current path to Vss through the transistors Q1 and Q3 and the column line D. The transistor Q2 is turned. off so that no current path is established from the column line D to ground, except through very high impedance standby resistors. As a result, the data node D remains substantially at VDD, while node D is being discharged low through Q3 and Q1 This allows sensing of the correct state of the cell.If, on the other hand, a logic nlv is stored in the address of the memory cell 10, transistors Q1 and Q3 are off and Q2 and Q4 are on, discharging the D line rather than D line, allowing the reverse state of the cell to be sensed. It is important in the read mode that the D and D discharge levels during readout of the cell be controlled so that nodes D and D do not fully discharge to Vss for substantial periods of time in that this would tend to write all other cells in the column to the readout state of the selected cell on the column.This is accomplished by insuring that the read cycle is limited in the respect that nodes D and D discharge less than 50 of the precharge value of VDD In this way, there is always a positive supply for the non selected cells, providing standby current to retain previously written data. To write the cell, it is necessary that nodes D or D, namelyDATA and DATA lines, are brought low near Vss, forcing low one of the two internal cross coupled nodes 1 or 2, depending respectively on whether it is node D or D that is brought low during the write cycle. Specifically, if node D is brought low when node 1 is high, transistor Q3 will turn on, pulling node 1 low, allowing transistor Q4 to pull node 2 high, forcing Q1 on and Q2 off. When RA is then returned to Vss, deseleeting the cell, or D is returned high to VDD, the cell retains the state written into it, since R2 will provide the current necessary to keep node 2 high, forcing Q1 to remain on, which forces node 1 to be low, keeping Q2 off.In this manner, there is cell data retention in a static manner with standby power supplied by the column lines through R1 and R2. In the process of writing the cell, again a DATA or DATA line is brought low. This condition, if maintained indefinitely, would write other cells on the column and must be limited to short time periods relative to the internal time constant of the cell. If, for example, R1 is a high valued resistor on the order of 100 megohms and the internal capacitance on node 1 of the cell is 0.1 pico farad, the time constant of node 1 or 2 would be very long compared to the necessary write time of the cell when node D orD is brought low, by several orders of magnitude. The foregoing procedure allows the selected cell to be safely written without writing other cells that are not selected on the column line, and allows elimination of the VDD line that transverses the cell as a connection to resistors R1 and R2. Specifically referring to United StatesPatent No. 4,125,854, VDD as shown in FIGURES 3, 4, 5 and 6 of said patent application has now been eliminated and the connections through contacts 42 are made with D or D. Eliminating VDD in this manner allows the memory cell area to be substantially reduced with favorable improvements in the cost of production and allows fabrication of integrated circuit memories with greater bit densities. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided an integrated circuit memory comprising a substrate of semiconductor material of a first conductivity type an array of memory cells fabricated on the substrate in rows and columns each cell of the array including first and second data storage transistors, first and second enabling transistors, and first and second impedance devices, each of the transistors having a gate, a source diffusion region, and a drain diffusion region formed in the substrate the gate of the second data storage transistor being electrically connected to the drain diffusion of the first data storage transistor, to the drain diffusion of the first enabling transistor, and to the first impedance device thereby defining a first data node in each cell of the array the gate of the first data storage transistor being electrically connected to the drain diffusion of the second data storage transistor, to the drain diffusion of the second enabling transistor, and to the second impedance device thereby defining a second data node in each cell of the array the drain diffusion of the first data storage transistor being formed in common with the drain diffusion of the first enabling transistor in each cell of the array the drain diffusion of the second storage transistor being formed in common with the drain ofthe second enabling transistor in each cell of the array the array including a first group of four of the cells disposed in mutually contiguous relation to each other in a first row and in a second row adjacent to the first row, and in a first column and in a second column adjacent to the first column the source diffusions of the second data storage transistors of contiguous cells in the first and second rows of the first group being formed in common, respectively and at least one of the first and second impedance devices of each cell of the first group being electrically connected to the source of at least one of the enabling transistors. The impedance devices are electrically connected in several different embodiments such as 1 wherein both of the first and second impedance devices are electrically connected to the source of the first enabling transistor see FIGURE 4 2 wherein both of the first and second impedance devices are electrically connected to the source of the second enabling transistor see FIGURE 3 3 wherein the first impedance device is electrically connected to the source of the first enabling transistor and the second impedance device is electrically connected to the source of the second enabling transistor see FIGURE 5 and 4 wherein the first impedance device is electrically connected to the source of the second enabling transistor and the second impedance device is electrically connected to the source of the first enabling transistor see FIGURE 6 . Referring now to FIGURE 7, a substrate layout of a grouping of four mutually contiguous memory cells is illustrated. The common impedance node 18 is connected to the complement data line D. The complete absence of a power supply to the common impedance node 18 should be noted. The memory cell 10 is disposed upon a substrate 26 of an extrinsic semiconductor material of a first conductivity type, for example,P type monocrystalline silicon. Each of the field effect transistors Q1 Q4 include a source region 28 and a drain region 30 FIGURES 7, 8 in which impurities of the opposite conductivity type, for example, N type, have been diffused and extend substantially parallel to each other in the conventional manner through an active region 32 of the substrate 26. A layer 34 of field insulation is disposed over the surface of the substrate 26 and is formed in a relatively thin layer 36 in the gate zone which lies directly over the active region 32. A diffused polysilicon layer 38 serves as a gate interconnect portion for the transistor Q1 formed over the active region 32.A layer 40 of the electrical insulation, preferably oxide, is formed over the gate strip 38 and over the field insulation 34. The semiconductor material which forms the conductive gate strip 38 is the same elemental semiconductor type as is the substrate 26, and is preferably constructed of a continuous layer of polycrystalline silicon. Extrinsic impurities are diffused within the gate strip 38 and may be either N type or P type. In a preferred embodiment, the extrinsic impurities diffused into the gate strip 38 are of the opposite conductivity type relative to the conductivity type of the substrate 26. For example, for a P type substrate 26, the impurities diffused into the gate strip 38 areN type, so that the diffusion of the gate strip 38, source and drain regions 28, 30 and impedance devices R1 and R2 may all be formed during a single diffusion step of an isoplanar silicon gate process. Each of the load impedance devices R1 and R2 include a body 42 of substantially pure intrinsic semiconductor material defining a series conductive path within the polysilicon gate strip 38. An intrinsic extrinsic junction 44 is defined by the interface of the diffused gate strip 38 and the undiffused intrinsic body 42. Each series path formed by the composit resistor gate strip interconnects the data lines D, D FIG. 3, 4 respectively to the corresponding data nodes 1, 2. As used herein, the phrase intrinsic semiconductive material means elemental semiconductor material which is undoped and which has not been diffused or otherwise implanted with impurities. The connection of the common impedance node 18 to the DATA line comprises a metallization deposit 46 which is bonded directly to the oxide layer 40. In conjunction with the embodiments described hereinbefore, it is preferred that the structural layout include the common impedance node 18 disposed substantially in the geometrical center of the first group of cells, the first and second load impedance devices R1 and R2 of each cell extending radially from the common impedance node to the interior of the cell. In conjunction with the embodiments described hereinbefore, it is preferred that the structural layout be such wherein each of the first and second impedance means R1 and R2 of each cell is formed as an integral portion of the polycrystalline silicon strip 38 which interconnects the common impedance node 18 to the corresponding first and second internal cell nodes 1 and 2 , respectively, each impedance means including a body of substantially pure polycrystalline silicon 42 defining a first conductive path and a diffusion of impurities of the opposite conductivity type disposed within a region of the body defining a second conductive path, a diffused n6ndiffused junction 44 being defined by the interface of the diffused region with the substantially pure polycrystalline silicon body, the first and second paths defining a series electrical path from the common impedance node 18 to the corresponding internal cell node.
