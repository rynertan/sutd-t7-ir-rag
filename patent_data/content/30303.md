# Air powered floor tool for a vacuum cleaner.

## Abstract
An air powered vacuum cleaner floor tool and an air turbine therefor are provided. The floor tool comprises a housing 11 with a rotary agitator 37 mounted on the bottom thereof, and a wand connector means 35 mount ed on the rear thereof and aligned with the longitudinal center of the housing 11 . The wand connector 35 is used for connecting the floor tool to a vacuum cleaner wand 7 . The air powered turbine motor has a turbine chamber 13 and a rotor 23 mounted on the housing, with the turbine chamber having an air inlet 19 and an air outlet 29 . The air inlet is aligned with the longitudinal center of the rotary agitator 37 , and the air outlet 29 is aligned with the longitudinal center of the housing 11 and with the wand connector 35 . The air outlet includes an outlet opening 29 in the turbine chamber 13 . The angle which is formed by the center line E of the air inlet 19 of the air powered motor, and the center line H of the outlet opening 29 of the turbine chamber, is less than 55 . Further, the turbine rotor 23 is rotatably mounted in the turbine chamber 13 so that the smallest area between the outer periphery of the rotor and the wall of the turbine chamber is equal to substantially one half of the area of the outlet opening 29 of the turbine chamber 13 .
