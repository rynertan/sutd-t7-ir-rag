# Room warming cooling and hot water supplying heat pump apparatus.

## Abstract
A room warming cooling and hot water supplying heat pump apparatus comprises a refrigerant circuit provided with a compressor 1 , a four way valve 2 for switching room warming and cooling operations, a room side heat exchanger 3 , a reversible flow type expansion device 4 and an outdoor side heat exchanger 5 , wherein a first switching means 7 is connected to the outlet side of the compressor 1 a first branch 7b of the switching means is connected to the four way valve 2 and a second branch 7c of the first switching means 7 is connected to one end of a heating coil 8 in a hot water tank 6 the other end of the heating coil extends out of the hot water tank 6 and has a branched part 11 . A pipeline 17,18 including the branched part has both ends connected to the refrigerant circuit at both sides of the expansion device 4 in which at least one valve means 9,10 is provided in the pipeline including the branched part 11 , and the first switching means 7 and the valve means 9,10 are controlled by a control device 16 .
