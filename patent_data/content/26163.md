# Turbulent transport contactor and method of its use.

## Abstract
A turbulent transport contactor is formed by a contacting zone or section 10 with means to introduce lightweight ele ments 24 and gas 12 at high velocity, adjacent one end. Liquid is also introduced to the zone. The high velocity gas entrains the liquid and the lightweight elements and trans ports them through the contact zone. Means 16 are provided to de entrain the lightweight elements and a significant por tion of said liquid at the end of the contact zone remote from said one end and to return the lightweight elements to said one end for re introduction into the zone.
