# A tandem brake booster.

## Abstract
A tandem brake booster 10 having first 24 and second 28 walls that move in opposite directions within a cavity to produce an output force. A lever arrangement 48 attached to the second 28 wall engages a fulcrum 70 to transfer a force produced by movement of the second wall 28 into the first 24 wall. A control mechanism 72 has a cylindrical body 74 with an annular surface 78 that engages the lever arrangement 48 . The movement of the cylindrical body 74 as compared to the output member 41 is a function of the ratio of the distance from the fulcrum 70 to end 46 and from the fulcrum 70 to the annular surface 78 , and as such, maximum output travel can be achieved without requiring a corresponding input travel.
