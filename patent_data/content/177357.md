## Description
cDNA CLONES CODING FOR POLYPEPTIDES EXHIBITING MURINE INTERLEUKIN 2 ACTIVITY This invention relates generally to the application of recombinant DNA technology to elucidate the control mechanisms of the mammalian immune response and, more particularly, to the isolation of deoxyribonucleic acid DNA clones coding for polypeptides exhibiting murine interleukin 2 activity. Recombinant DNA technology refers generally to the technique of integrating genetic information from a donor source into vectors for subsequent processing, such as through introduction into a host, whereby the transferred genetic information is copied and or expressed in the new environment. Commonly, the genetic information exists in the form of complementary DNA cDNA derived from messenger RNA mRNA coding for a desired protein product. The carrier is frequently a plasmid having the capacity to incorporate cDNA for later replication in a host and, in some cases, actually to control expression of the cDNA and thereby direct synthesis of the encoded product in the host. This technology has progressed extremely rapidly in recent years, and a variety of exogenous proteins have been expressed in a variety of hosts. By way of example, some of the eukaryotic proteins soproduced include proinsulin Naber, S. et al., Gene 21 95 104 1983 interferons Simon, L. et al., Proc.Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80 2059 2062 1983 andDerynck, R. et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 1 1819 1837 19831 growth hormone Goeddel, D., et al., Nature 281 544 548 19791 and mast cell growth factor Yokota et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 81 1070 1074 1984 . These publications and other reference materials have been included to provide additional details on the background of the pertinent art and, in particular instances, the practice of invention, and are all incorporated herein by reference. For some time, it has been dogma that the mammalian immune response was due primarily to a series of complex cellular interactions, called the immune network .Although it remains clear that much of the response does in fact revolve around the network like interactions of lymphocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and other cells, immunologists now generally hold the opinion that soluble proteins e.g., the so called lymphokines play a critical role in controlling these cellular interactions. Lymphokines apparently mediate cellular activities in a variety of ways. They have been shown to have the ability to support the proliferation and growth of various lymphocytes and, indeed, are thought to play a crucial role in the basic differentiation of pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells into the vast number of progenitors of the diverse cellular lineages responsible for the immune response. Cell lineages important in this response include two classes of lymphocytes B cells, which can produce and secrete immunoglobulins proteins with the capability of recognizing and binding to foreign matter to effect its removal and T cells of various subsets that induce or suppress B cells and some of the other cells including other T cells making up the immune network. Research to better understand and thus potentially treat therapeutically immune disorders, through the study of B cells, T cells and the other cells involved in the immune response, has been hampered by the general inability to maintain these cells in vitro. such cells could be isolated and cultured by growing them on secretions from other cells, e.g., conditioned media from splenic lymphocytes stimulated with Concanavalin A ConA . It has now become clear from this work that the generation of cell clones is dependent on specific factors, such as lymphokines. Some of the better characterized lymphokines are the so called interleukins, e.g., lymphocyte activating factor LAF , which is released from macrophages and can induce replication of thymocytes and peripheral T cells Mizel, S. et al., J. Immunol. 120 1497 1503 1978 , T cell growth factor TCGF , which was initially detected in conditioned media from lectinstimulated lymphocytes Morgan, D. et al., Science 193 1007 1008 1976 , and mast cell growth factor MCGF , which was found in lectin stimulated T cell clones Nabel, G. et al., Nature 291 332 334 1981 . In 1979, the Second International Lymphokine Workshop labelled LAF as interleukin l IL 1 , and TCGF as interleukin 2 IL 2 . Similarly, although not officially, MCGF is now known generally as interleukin 3 IL 3 Ihle, J. et al., J. Immunol. 131 282 287 1983 . In view of the central role T cells play in the immune response, their growth factor, IL 2, has been the subject of considerable study since its discovery about 10 years ago Smith, K. Immunol. Rev. 51 337 357 1980 . IL 2 s prime function is almost certainly the stimulation and maintenance of proliferation of most T cell subsets. In fact, the removal of IL 2 from proliferating T cells results in their death within a few hours Ruscette, F. et al., J. Immunol. 123 2928 2931 1977 . IL 2 has also been shown to be one of the lymphokines responsible for cytotoxic T lymphocyte generation, as well as differentiation and induction of function. Importantly, IL 2 s function is not restricted to being just a growth factor for activated T cells. The secretion by T cells of y interferon and B cell growth factors appears to be induced by IL 2 Torres, B. et al.,J. Immunol. 126 1120 1134 1982 and Howard, M. et al.,J. Exp. Med. 158 2024 2039 1983 . Indeed IL 2 may be at the center of the lymphokine mediated immune response for a detailed description of IL 2 activities, seeFarrar, J. et al., Immunol. Rev. 63 129 166 1982 . Several procedures have been developed for the isolation and purification of IL 2 e.g., Watson, J. et al., J. Exp. Med. 150 849 855 1979 Engleman, E. et al., J. Immunol. 127 2124 2127 1981 and U.S. PatentsNos. 4,404,280 and 4,407,945 . These procedures generally entail culturing normal spleen cells or certain lymphoma cell lines, and then stimulating the cells with a mitogen. This often results in relatively low concentrations of IL 2 in the cell media, so that subsequent concentration and purification presents a formidable task. Furthermore, the IL 2 preparations almost undoubtedly contain some residual mitogen, as well as contaminating proteins from the IL 2 producing cell line. The development of murine T cell hybridomas producing IL 2 has mitigated the mitogen contamination, but the problem remains that most, if not all, murine IL2 preparations contain other immunological proteins.These proteins can influence assay results, and thus interfere with the unequivocable determination of the precise range of IL 2 activities. In the human system, these problems have been basically alleviated by the successful cloning and expression of cDNAs encoding for human IL 2 Taniguchi,T. et al., Nature 302 305 310 11983 and Devos, R. et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 11 4307 4323 1983 , but the problems remain in the murine system. Given that most immunological experiments are still performed on mice or mouse derived cells, research is still greatly hampered. Indeed, the molecular properties of IL 2 remain uncertain. Although it presently appears that the molecular weight of IL 2 is approximately 30 35,000 daltons Shaw, J. et al., J. Immunol. 120 1967 1973 1978 , at least one investigator believes that murineIL 2 is a dimer made up of two 16,000 dalton components Caplan, B. et al., J. Immunol. 126 1351 1354 1981 . Translation in Xenopus laevis oocytes of sizefractionated mRNA indicating that one or more murine mRNA species of about 1000 to 1100 nucleotides encode a protein exhibiting IL 2 activity has shed some light on the question Bleackley, R. et al., J. Immunol. 127 2432 2435 1981 , but research has still been slowed by the absence of coding sequences and means for producing large quantities of the desired protein. Clarification of many of the outstanding issues relating to the molecular biology of murine interleukin 2 requires additional structural data, e.g., substantially full length sequence analysis of the protein and nucleic acid molecules in question. Protein sequencing offers, of course, a possible means to resolve the matter to a certain degree, but it is very difficult work experimentally and often can provide neither completely accurate nor full length amino acid sequences. In fact, murine IL 2 appears to be blocked near the NH2 terminus, rendering protein sequencing even more difficult. Moreover, having the capability of making bulk quantities of a polypeptide exhibiting murine IL 2 activity and substantially free from other murine proteins will greatly facilitate the study of the biology of T cells and other cells involved in the immune response e.g., by minimizing the necessity of relying on lectin conditioned media for stimulating cell growth.Accurate and complete sequence data on murine IL 2 will help elucidate the structure of that compound and also serve to simplify the search for other immunological factors. Finally, additional information on any lymphokine will help in evaluating the roles of the various growth factors and cells of the immune network and thus provide insight into the entire immune system with the concomitant therapeutic benefits. Thus, there exists a significant need for extensive nucleotide sequence data on the DNAs coding for, and for the amino acid sequences of, proteins exhibiting murine IL i activity, as well as a simpleu economic method of making substantial and essentially pure quantities of such materials. The present invention fulfills these needs. The present invention provides cDNA clones coding for polypeptides exhibiting murine IL 2 activity. The cDNA sequence can be integrated into various vectors, which in turn can direct the synthesis of the corresponding polypeptides in a variety of hosts, including eukaryotic cells, such as mammalian cells in culture. The invention also provides a process for producing a polypeptide exhibiting murine interleukin 2 activity, which comprises the steps of a providing a vector comprising a nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide, wherein the nucleotide sequence is capable of being expressed by a host containing the vector b incorporating the vector into the host and c maintaining the host containing the vector under conditions suitable for expression of the nucleotide sequence into the polypeptide. Preferably, the cDNA sequences are derived from an mRNA sequence coding for the polypeptides, and the host is an organism such as a eukaryotic, e.g. mammalian, cell transfected or transformed with the vector.Further, the vector preferably comprises also a second nucleotide sequence capable of controlling expression of the nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide. This second sequence coding can include a promoter sequence, one or more intron sequences and a polyadenylation sequence, to permit, respectively, transcription, splicing and polyadenylation of the nucleotide sequence coding for the polypeptide. Particularly, when the host is a mammalian cell, such as a COS 7 monkey kidney cell, the vector contains the promoter sequence of the simian virus 40 SV40 early region promoter and the polyadenylation sequence of the SV40 late region polyadenylation sequence. The mouse cDNA sequence, or a portion thereof, is capable of hybridizing with other DNA sequences, such as DNA coding for other mammalian growth factors from a cDNA or genomic library. It is noted that the described cDNA sequences seem to contain information for a leader sequence. The polypeptides of the present invention are capable of enhancing growth of murine T cell and other cells, particularly in cultures in vitro. Suitable compositions for sustaining IL 2 receptive cell lines can be prepared by adding the polypeptides preparations of which are essentially free of other murine growth factors to well known cell growth media formulations. Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which describes, in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and by way of example, the present invention. Figure 1 illustrates the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone and putative corresponding amino acid sequence of a polypeptide exhibiting murine IL 2 activity Figure 2A illustrates pcD IL 2, a plasmid carrying a cDNA clone exhibiting IL 2 activity Figure 2B is a restriction endonuclease cleavage map of the cDNA insert of Figure 2A. Figure 3 represents a comparison between putative murine and human IL 2 amino acid sequences. Figure 4A shows the structure of yeast preproalpha factor, including the amino acid sequence of the first spacer alpha factor and a portion of the second spacer. Figure 4B shows the construction of a general yeast construction vector, designated pMFa8. In accordance with the present invention, cDNA clones are provided that code for polypeptides exhibitingIL 2 activity. After the cDNA sequences have been incorporated into replicable expression vectors, and the vectors transfected into an appropriate host e.g. a mammalian cell culture , the expressed polypeptide or polypeptides have the ability to allow the expansion of T cells and their related lineages. An exemplary, putative amino acid sequence based on the isolated nucleotide sequence is shown inFigure 1. The murine IL 2 cDNA contains a single openreading frame consisting of 168 codons. Downstream of the putative initiation codon is a region rich in hydrophobic amino acids. Including the asparagine codon at amino acid position 19, there is a stretch of nine continuous amino acids identical to that predicted for human IL 2. The alanine residue in this sequence coincides with the NH 2 terminal amino acid deduced for human IL 2 Stern, A. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 81 871 875 1984 . It is likely, therefore, that the mature form of secreted mouse IL 2 begins with an alanine residue, and the preceeding 20 amino acids constitute a leader region, which is subject to removal by proteolytic processing. Thus, mature murine IL 2 would consist of about 149 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 16,000 daltons unglycosylated . The mature protein probably contains 20 acidic Asp Glu and 14 basic Arg Lys amino acids, the difference in numbers perhaps accounting for the acidic isolectric point pI 4.3 4.9 of the protein Watson, J. et al., J. Exp. Med. 150 849 861 1979 .There do not appear to be any potential N glycosylation sites Asn X Ser Thr Neuberger, A. et al.,Glycoproteins 5, 450 490, Elsevier Publishing Co., U.S.A. 1972 , however, the presence of other in vivo modifications, such as sialylation or O glycosylation, cannot be excluded. When transfected into COS 7 monkey cells or other suitable expression systems, cDNA clones of this invention can direct the synthesis of biologically active murine IL 2. Addition of this expressed cloned gene product to cultures of mouse T cells allows expansion of receptive cells and or their maintenance in culture. The expressed polypeptides can exhibit the assorted activities associated with murine IL 2. A variety of methods may be used to prepare the cDNAs of the present invention. By way of example, total mRNA is extracted e.g., as reported by Berger, S. et al., Biochemistry 18 5143 5149 1979 from cells e.g.a hybrid cell line producing polypeptides exhibiting murine IL 2 activity. The double stranded cDNAs from this total mRNA can be constructed by using primerinitiated reverse transcription Verma, I., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 473 1 38 19773 to make first the complement of each mRNA sequence, and then by priming for second strand synthesis Land, H. et al., Nucleic AcidsRes., 9 2251 2266 1981 . Subsequently, the cDNAs can be cloned by joining them to suitable plasmid or bacteriophage vectors Rougeon, F. et al., Nucleic AcidsRes., 2, 2365 2378 1975 or Scherer, G. et al., Dev.Biol. 86, 438 447 1981 through complementary homopolymeric tails Efstratiadis, A. et al., Cell, 10, 571 585 1977 or cohesive ends created with linker segments containing appropriate restriction sites Seeburg, P. et al., Nature, 270, 486 494 1977 orShine, J. et al., Nature, 270, 494 499 1977 , and then transforming a suitable host. See generallyEfstratiadis, A., and Villa Kormaroff, L., Cloning of double stranded cDNA in Setlow, J. and Hollaender, A. eds. Genetic Engineering, Vol. 1, Plenum PublishingCorp., N.Y., U.S.A. 1982 . A preferred method of obtaining the full length cloned cDNAs of this invention is the procedure developed by H. Okayama and P. Berg Mol. and Cell. Biol., 2 161170 1982 . This method has the advantage of placing the cDNA inserts in a bacterial cloning vector at a position whereby the cDNA can also be directly translated and processed in mammalian cells. Briefly, the first cDNA strand is primed by polydeoxythymidylic acid covalently joined to one end of a linear plasmid vectorDNA. The plasmid vector is then cyclized with a linkerDNA segment that bridges one end of the plasmid to the 5 end of the cDNA coding sequence.By employing a DNA fragment containing the Simian Virus 40 SV40 early region promoter and a linker containing a modified SV40 late region intron, the cDNA can be expressed in vitro inCOS 7 mouse kidney cells without further modification. See generally Okayama, H. and Berg, P.,Mol. and Cell. Biol., 3 280 289 1983 and Jolly, D. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80 477 481 1983 . Once the cDNA library in the Okayama Berg plasmid vector has been completed, the cDNA clones are collected, and random pools are checked for the presence of the desired cDNAs by hybrid selection, translation, and assay e.g. by measuring murine IL 2 activity, the existence of antigenic determinants, or other biological activities .Pools positive by these criteria can then be probed with an appropriate subtracted probe, e.g., cDNA from a B cell line and or uninduced T cell line.Thereafter, the positive, probed pools are divided into individual clones which are tested by transfection into a suitable host such as a mammalian cell culture , and the host cuprnatant assayed for the desired activity e.g.TCGF activity . Positive clones are then sequenced. The desired cDNA clones can be detected and isolated by hybridization screening with appropriate mRNA samples Heindell, H. et al., Cell, 15 43 54 19781 . Alternatively, the cDNA libraries can be screened by hybrid selection Harpold, M. et al., Nucleic Acid Res., 5 2039 2053 1978 or Parnes, J. et al., Proc. Nat.Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 78 2253 2257 11981 or in Xenopus oocytes Aurdon, J., Nature, 233 177 182 1971 . See generally Villa Komaroff, L. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci. U.S.A., 75 3727 3731 19783. In further describing the procedures relating to preparing cDNA clones of the invention, the assay cell line and other lines will be considered first, followed by general descriptions of the procedures for isolating mRNA coding for a protein exhibiting murine IL 2 activity the construction of a cDNA library containing the cDNA sequences isolation of full length cDNA clones in a plasmid vector and subsequent expression in mammalian cells subcloning and expression in bacteria and yeast and purification and formulation. A more detailed description of the entire experimental process will follow thereafter.T Cell and Other Lines Any of a large variety of different cells may be used as sources for murine IL 2 activity and in the assay thereof see, e.g., Robert Guroff, M. et al., T Cell Growth Factor Growth and Maturation Factors, ed. Guroff, G., New York John Wiley and Sons, pgs. 267308 at 287 1984 and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,404,280 and 4,407,945 . A preferred source is Ld32 1 ATCC accession number CRL 8629 , but the mouse T lymphoma EL 4 Farrar, J. et al., J. Immunol. 125 2555 2558 1980 or other cell producing IL 2 activity is acceptable. The LB2 1 cell line was derived from a C57BL 6 mouse immunized with chicken red blood cells CRBC of the MHC genotypeB2 B2.This line can be stimulated by B2 B2 CRBC in the presence of syngeneic spleen cells, by allogeneic spleen cells bearing the a or d m s haplotype, or by ConA. LB21 can be grown on alternating cycles of antigen plus spleen stimulator cells followed by several days of IL 2dependent proliferation see, Clayberger, C. et al., J.Exp. Med. 157 1906 1919 1983 . Similarly, preferred cell lines for use in connection with murine IL 2 activity assays are the HT 2 line and those developed as described by Watson, J. J.Exp. Med. 157 1906 1919 t19831 , Mouse thymocytes Disabato, G. et al., Cell. Immunol. 17 494 504 1975 , cloned cytotoxic T cell lines Morgan, D. et al., Science 193 1007 1008 1976 , and other murineIL 2 responsive lines are also suitable. The HT 2 line may be grown in complete medium, which includes RPMI 1640, 10 fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mM 2 mercaptoethanol 2 ME and partially purified spleen cell supernatant. To determine IL 2 activity using the HT 2 cells, a colorimetric proliferation assay is preferably utilized Mosmann, T., J. Immunol. Methods 65 55 63 19831 . However, the microassay procedure of Gillis, S.et al. J. of Immunol. 120 2027 2032 1978 , indirect assays e.g., Granelli Pipeno, A. et al., J. Exp. Med.154 422 430 1981 , or other well known assay systems are suitable. Units of TCGF can be calculated by determining the dilution of factor required to give 50 of the maximum stimulation, with one unit defined as the amount of IL 2 required to give 50 of the maximum signal using 2,000 HT 2 cells in a volume of 0.01 ml. Isolation of mRNA and Construction of a cDNA Library Total cellular mRNA can be isolated by a variety of well known methods e.g., Przybla, A. et al.,J. Biol. Chem. 254 2154 2158 1979 , but the preferred is the guanidinium thiocyanate extraction procedure ofChirgwin et al. Biochemistry, 18 5294 5299 1979 . If this method is used, approximately 10 ug of polyA mRNA, selected on columns of oligo dT cellulose, is obtained from 1 2 x 108 activated T cells, such as LB2 1. The cDNA library from the polyA mRNA can best be constructed using the pcDVl vector primer and the pLl linker fragment available from P L Biochemicals Inc.,Milwaukee, WI according to procedures which result in greatly enriched full length copies of mRNA transcripts e.g. Okayama, H. and Berg, P., Mol. Cell Biol., 2, 161170 1982 and Mol. Cell Biol., 3, 280 289 1983 . The plasmid vector, which contains SV40 early promoter andSV40 RNA processing signals, is designed to promote expression of the cloned cDNA segment in mammalian cells. Using the Okayama and Berg procedure, the cyclized vector cDNA preparation is transformed into a competent bacterial cell, such as E. coli My 1061 cells Casadaban, M. and Cohen, S., J. Mol. Biol., 138 179 207 1980J using calcium chloride Cohen, S. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 69 2110 2114 19721 . Starting with 5 llg of polyA RNA fran ConA stimulated C1 Ly 1 2 9 cells, about 1.5 x 106 independent transformants are obtained. About 104 clones are picked up individually and inoculated into wells of microtiter plates FlowLaboratories Inc., McLean, Virginia containing 200 1ll ofL broth, 50 vg ml of ampicillin, and 7 DMSO. If desired, sublibraries based on the size of cDNA insert are prepared from total cDNA library as described by Okayama, H. and Berg, P. Mol. Cell Biol., 3, 280 289 1983 . Briefly, plasmid DNA is digested with SalI,ClaI, and HindIII separately, and electrophoresed in 1 agarose gel.After staining with ethidium bromide, the gel is sliced into 7 sections corresponding to cDNA insert sizes of 0 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6, and more than 6 kilobases kb . DNA is extracted from each slice, recyclized with T4 DNA ligase, and used to transform My 1061. All nucleotide sequencing can be performed according to the procedure of Maxam, A. andGilbert, W. Methods Enzymol., 65 499 560 1980 .DNA Trans fect ions into Monkey Cells Approximately lx106 COS 7 monkey kidney cells are seeded onto 60 mm plates the day prior to transfection. Trans fect ions are best performed with 15 ug of plasmid DNA in 1.5 ml of DME containing 50 mMTris.HCl, pH 7.4, and 400 ug ml DEAE Dextran PharmaciaFine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden . This solution is then removed after 4 hr and replaced with 2.0 ml DME 4 fetal calf serum. The medium is collected after 72 hr and assayed for murine IL 2 activity as described above. DNA transfections may be carried out in L cells and a variety of other cell sources as well see below .Expression in E. coil, in Yeast and in Cell Culture Prokaryotes, such as E. coli, are very suitable for expression of the polypeptides of the present invention see, for example, U.S. patent numbers 4,338,397 and 4,411,994 , provided glycosylation is not desired. To obtain high expression levels, promoters should be utilized, such as the B lactamase penicillinase and lactose promoter systems Chang et al., Nature, 275 615 19781 Itakura et al., Science, 198 1056 1977 Goeddel et al., Nature 281 544 1979 or a tryptophan trp promoter system Goeddel et al.,Nucleic Acids Res., 8 4057 1980 in conjunction withShine Delgarno sequences. Those skilled in the art will realize that not only prokaryotes but also eukaryotic microbes, such as yeast, may also be used in protein production.Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a preferred eukaryotic microorganism. Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 255 1207312080 1980 or other glycolytic enzymes Hess et al., Adv. Enzyme Reg., 7 149 167 1969 Holland et al.,Biochemistry, 17 4900 4907 1978 . Other promoters that have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions may be used. Basically any plasmid vector containing a yeast compatible promoter, an origin of replication and termination sequences is suitable. The preferred method of making murine IL 2 employing the cDNAs of the present invention utilizes the yeast mating pheromone a factor secretory pathways Julius, D. et al., Cell 32 839 852 1983 . S.cerevisiae secretes mating type specific oligopeptide pheromones. MATa cells secrete a factor, which induces the growth arrest of MATa cells at G1 phase of the cell cycle Thorner, J., The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY 1981 see particularly pages 143 180 . The a factor is initially synthesized as a larger precursor molecule consisting of an NH2 terminal signal sequence of about amino acids, followed by an additional 60 amino acids leader sequence and ending with four identical tandem repeats of the mature a factor sequence. The repeats are separated from each other by six or eight amino acids spacers Lys Arg Glu Ala Glu Ala and Lys Arg Glu Ala Glu or Asp Ala Glu Ala .This prepro a factor is cleaved at several specific sites. The first processing is the cleavage of the COOH terminal side of the Lys Arg pair of the spacer sequence catalysed by the KEX2 product Julius et al., Cell 37 1075 1089 1984 . Carboxypeptidase B like enzyme cleaves at the NH2 terminal side of the LysArg pair. The final step is the removal of Glu Ala orAsp Ala pairs by diaminopeptidase, which is encoded by the STE13 See Figure 4A . Brake, J. et al. Proc. Nat.Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81 4642 4646 1984 have shown that the fusion of the sequence encoding mature human proteins including human IL 2 to the first processing site allowed secretion of such proteins. A general yeast expression vector, designated pMF alpha 8, containing the alpha factor promoter and downstream leader sequence in conjunction with other elements, has been deposited with the ATCC accession number 40140 . It can be constructed as follows SeeFigure 4B A 1.7 kb EcoRI fragment carrying the MFal gene Kurjan, J. and Hershowitz, I., Cell. 30 933 943 11982 is cloned into the EcoRI restriction site ofM13mp8 Viera, J. and Messing, J., Gene 19 259 268 11982 , In order to introduce a HindIII site after the lysine codon of the first spacer region, the synthetic oligonucleotide TCTTTTATCCAAAGATACCC is hybridized to the single strand M13 MFal DNA and the oligonucleotide primer extended by DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment.After S1 nuclease treatment, the DNA is cleaved with EcoRI, and the fragment carrying the MFal promoter and leader sequence is cloned into the EcoRI and filled in HindIII restriction sites of pUC8 Viera, J. and Messing, J. above bne plasmid with the desired structure can be isolated designated pMFa4Al in Figure 4B . The pMFa4Al is cleaved with HindIII and partially filled in with DNA polymerase I Rlenow fragment in the presence of dATP and dGTP. The DNA is treated with mung bean nuclease, and the oligonucleotide linker GCCTCGAGGC is attached. The resultant plasmid designated pMFa5 in Figure 4B will have a StuI cleavage site immediately after the arginine codon, followed by the XhoI restriction site.AnS.cerevisiae E.coli shuttle vector pTRP584 can be constructed as follows the PstI XbaI fragment carrying 2 pm plasmid replication origin Broach, J. above is cloned into the ClaI restruction site of pTRP56 Miyajima et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 4 407 414 1984 , and theStuI restriction site within the TRPl ARSl fragment is converted into a PvuII restriction site by PvuII linker insertion. The KpnI restriction site in the original pTRP56 is converted to XhoI by the XhoI linker insertion. The general secretion vector pMFa8 is then obtained by insertion of the BglII XhoI fragment of pMFa5 into the BamHl XhoI restriction sites of pTRP584. Those skilled in the art will realize that cDNA clones encoding for murine IL 2 may then be readily inserted into the pMFa8 vector and subsequently transformed in yeast for IL 2 production. By way of example, the PstI BamHl fragment carrying the entire IL 2 cDNA is transfered from pcD IL 2 into the PstI BamHl sites of pUC9 Viera, J. and Messing, J. above and cleaved with HinP1 and SmaI. SmaI cleaves downstream of the cDNA insert. The fragment is treated with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment in the presence of dCTP and treated with mung bean nuclease. The fragment is then cloned into the StuI restriction site of pMFa8. This plasmid DNA carrying the TRP1 gene can be introduced into yeast cells by the lithium acetate method Ito, H.et al., J. Bacteriol. 153 163 168 19831 and transformants are selected in synthetic medium lacking tryptophan. Transformants are then grown in a common medium supplemented with 0.5 casamino acids. For harvesting, the yeast cells, resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline PBS containing 1 mM PMSF, are disintegrated by vigorous shaking with acid washed glass beads. Clear supernatant is obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. In addition to microorganisms, cell cultures derived from multicellular organisms especially mammalian cells may also be used as hosts. Examples of such useful host cell lines are HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, and baby hamster kidney cell lines. Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include, as necessary, an origin of replication, a promoter located in front of the gene to be expressed, along with any required ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites, and transcriptional terminator sequences. When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector often has control functions provided by viral material. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and most frequentlySV 40. See, e.g., U.S. patent No. 4,399,216 andGheysen, D. and Fiers, W., J. of Mol. and Appl.Genetics 1 385 394 1982 . Purification and Formulations The murine IL 2 polypeptides expressed inE.coli, in yeast or in other cells can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation column chromatography e.g., ion exchange, gel filtration, electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, etc. and ultimately crystallization see generally Enzyme purification and Related Techniques , Methods inEnzymology, 22 233 577 1977 . Once purified, partially or to homogeneity, the polypeptides of the invention may be used for research purposes, e.g., as a supplement to cell growth media e.g., minimum essential medium Eagle, Iscove s modified Dulbecco Medium or RPMI 1640 available from Sigma Chemical Company, St.Louis,MO and GIBCO Division, Chagrin Falls, OH and as an antigenic substance for eliciting specific immunoglobulins useful in immunoassays, immunofluorescent stainings, etc. See generally Immunological Methods ,Vols. I II, Eds. Lefkovits, I. and Pernis, B., AcademicPress, New York, N.Y. f1979 1981 and Handbook ofExperimental Immunology , ed. Weir, D., BlackwellScientific Publications, St. Louis, MO 1978 . If yeast cultures containing cDNAs of the present invention are utilized to prepare murine IL 2, purification preferably is accomplished as follows. Up to one liter of 12 hr culture fluid is diluted with an equal volume of 0.2 trifluoroacetic acid TFA and 40 CH3CN, and pumped directly onto a 4.6 X 75 mm propyl column Ultrapare RPSC, Altex, Berkeley, CA previously equilibrated with 0.1 TFA, 20 CH3CN.Sample application can be at a flow rate of about 1 ml min at 4 C. When all the sample has been applied, the column is connected to a conventional HPLC system at room temperature, and further washed at 0.5 ml min until the absorbance monitored at 214 nM reaches baseline. A gradient of increasing solvent concentration is then applied 0.5 CH3CN per min , and 1 ml fractions collected. The murine IL 2 elutes about 65 min after the start of the gradient in a peak well separated from other proteins. Analysis of the peak fractions on silverstained Laemmli gels Laemmli, U., Nature 227 680 685 1970 should indicate that the protein is 95 pure. The following experimental information and data are offered by way of example and not by way of limitation. EXPERIMENTALA. Cloned LB2 1 T Cells 1 A clone of T Cells LB2 1 ATCC accession number CRL 8629 expressing the Thy 1 Ly 1 2 phenotype is continuously maintained at 0.5 x 105 cells ml in RPMI 1640 with 10 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 x 10 5 M 2 ME, 2 mM glutamine, non essential amino acids, and essential vitamins conditioned with 5 DEAE treated supernatants from ConA treated Lewis strain rat spleen cells. 2 ConA activation of LB2 1 cells The cells are cultured at 5 x 105 ml in DME with 4 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 x 10 5 M 2 ME, 2mM glutamine, non essential amino acids, essential vitamins and 4 pg ml ConA. After 12 14 hrs. incubation at 37 C in 108 CO2, the cell suspension is centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes. The cell pellets are collected and frozen immediately at 700C. The supernatants are filtered Nalgene 0.22 microns and stored at 800C as a source of growth factors. Aliquots of the supernatant are assayed for murine IL 2 activity see below to verify the induction of the line by the ConA treatment. B. Cloned HT 2 Cells The T cell line utilized in the murine IL 2 assays was HT 2, a line first described by Watson, J. J. Exp. Med. 150 1510 1519 1979 . It is continuously maintained with doubling times of about 24 hours in RPMI 1640 with 10 heat inactivated FCS, 5 x 10 5 M 2 ME and 2 mM glutamine, non essential amino acids and essential vitamins supplemented with 5 supernatant from ConA activated LB2 1 cells. The growth of the HT 2 cell clone is dependent on the active growth factor s obtained from the supernatant of stimulated LB2 1 cells. C. Tetrazolium Salt MTT Colorimetric Assay for Murine IL 2. 1 About 2000 cells were cultured in flat bottomed 96 well microtiter trays in 0.1 ml of DME supplemented with co factors and test supernatant as described above. 2 The trays were incubated at 370C in 10 CO2. After twenty hours, 0.01 ml of 5 mg ml MTT 3 4 , 5 dimethy lthia zol 2 y 1 2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO in phosphate buffered saline PBS was added to each culture. Four hours later 0.1 ml of 0.04 N HC1 in isopropanol was added to each culture and thoroughly mixed. After a few minutes, the plates were read on a Dynatech MR580 Microelisa Auto Reader Dynatech Instruments, Inc., Torrance, CA , at a wavelength of 570 nm reference wavelength of 630nm and a calibration setting of 1.99.D. Isolation of mRNA from LB2 1 Cells. 1 Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells using the guanidine isothiocyanate procedure of Chirgwin, J. et al., Biochemistry, 18 5294 5299 11979 . Frozen cell pellets from uninduced or ConA induced LB2 1 cells 6, 8, and 11 hr after stimulation were suspended in guanidine isothiocyanate lysis solution. solution was used for 1.5 x 108 cells. Pellets were resuspended by pipetting, and then DNA was sheared by 4 passes through a syringe using a 16 gauge needle. The lysate was layered on top of 20 ml of 5.7 M CsCl, 10 mM EDTA in 40 ml polyallomer centrifuge tube. This solution was centrifuged at 25,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA for 40 hrs at 150C. The guanidine isothiocyanate phase containing DNA was pipetted off from the top, down to the interface. The walls of the tube and interface were washed with 2 3 ml of guanidine isothiocyanate lysis solution.The tube was cut below the interface with scissors, and the CsCl solution was decanted. RNA pellets were washed twice with cold 70 ethanol. Pellets were then resuspended in 500 1 of 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05 SDS. 50 p1 of 3M sodium acetate was added and RNA was precipitated with 1 ml ethanol. About 0.3 mg total RNA was collected by centrifuging and the pellets washed once with cold ethanol. 2 PolyA mRNA isolation Washed and dried total RNA pellet was resuspended in 900 ul of oligo dT elution buffer 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 SDS . RNA was heated for 3 min. at 680C and then chilled on ice. 100 p1 of 5 M NaCl was added. The RNA sample was loaded onto a 1.0 ml oligo dT cellulose column Type 3, Collabora tive Research, Waltham, MA equilibrated with binding buffer 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M Nail, 0.5 SDS. . Flow through from the column was passed over the column twice more. The column was then washed with 20 ml binding buffer. PolyA mRNA was collected by washing with elution buffer. RNA usually eluted in the first 2 ml of elution buffer. RNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 6 and two volumes of ethanol. The RNA pellet was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with cold ethanol, and dried. The pellet was then resuspended in water. Aliquots were diluted, and absorbance at 260 nm was determined.E. Oocyte Injection Oocytes were removed from female Xenopus laevis and incubated in Barth s solution 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KC1, 0.33 mM Ca NO3 2, 0.41 mM CaC12, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 2.4 mM NaHC03, and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.9 Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO . Injection clusters of 2 3 oocytes were prepared. RNA samples were to be injected dissolved in injection buffer 40 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 0.35 M NaCl . Total polyA mRNA was resuspended at a concentration of 500 vg ml in injection buffer, while RNA samples eluted from DNA filters fran hybrid selections see below always contained 5 ug of calf liver tRNA as carrier and were resuspended in 2 ul of injection buffer.About 40 nl aliquots were injected into each oocyte using micropipets pulled by hand with tips forged using a microforge. The pipettes were calibrated with known volumes of sterile water. Approximately 10 to 20 oocytes were injected for each mRNA sample. The injected oocytes were incubated in groups of two or three in individual wells of 96 well microtiter dishes containing 10 pl of Barth s solution 1 bovine serum albumin per oocyte. The oocytes were kept at 190C for 48 hours. Thereafter, supernatants from triplicate pools of six oocytes each were assayed for IL 2 activity. The supernatants were were first sterilized by centrifuging for 10 minutes in a microcentrifuge and then assayed. Supernatants from uninjected oocytes were always collected as a control. The assay results from supernatants collected from untreated or ConA stimulated LB2 1 cells are shown in Table I. Titration of all samples, including the reference standard, was performed in triplicate. Units of.IL 2 were calculated by determining the dilution of factor requested to give 50 of maximum stimulation, and one unit is defined as the amount of murine IL 2 required to give 50 of the maximum signal using 2,000 HT 2 cells in a volume of 0.1 ml. LB2 1 cells were harvested at 6, 8, and 11 hr following the addition of Con A.Uninduced cells were grown identically, but omitting Con A. Poly A RNA was prepared from each cell pellet and then injected into Xenopus oocytes as described. The supernatants from stimulated and unstimulated cells and the oocyte supernatants were assayed for TCGF activity on the HT2 cell line.

Preparation of vector primer and oligo dG tailed linker DNAs The procedure of Okayama Berg Mol. Cell. Biol. 2 161 170 1982 was used with only minor modifications and adapted to the pcDVl and pLl plasmids described by Okayama Berg Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 380 389 1983 . An 80 ug sample of pcDVl DNA was digested at 300C with 20 U of KpnI I endonuclease in a reaction mixture of 450 ul containing 6 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.5 , 6 mM MgCl2, 6 mM NaCl, 6 mM 2 ME, and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin BSA per ml. After 16 hr the digestion was terminated with 40 ul of 0.25 M EDTA pH 8.0 and 20 ul of 10 sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS the DNA was recovered after extraction with water saturated 1 1 phenol CHC13 hereafter referred to as phenol CHC13 and ethanol precipitation. Homopolymer tails averaging 60, but not more than 80, deoxythymidylate dT residues per end were added to the KpnI endonuclease generated termini with calf thymus terminal transferase as follows The reaction mixture 38 p1 contained sodium cacodylate 30 mM Tris.HCl pH 6.8 as buffer, with 1 mM CoC12, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM dTTP, the KpnI endonuclease digested DNA, and 68 U of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase P L Biochemicals, Inc., Milwaukee, WI . After 30 min. at 370C the reaction was stopped with 20 ul of 0.25 M EDTA pH 8.0 and 10 ul of 10 SDS, and the DNA was recovered after several extractions with phenol CHC13 by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then digested with 15 U of EcoRI endonuclease in 50 Ul containing 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 10 mMMgC12, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg of BSA per ml for 5 hr at 370C. The large fragment, containing the SV40 polyadenylation site and the pBR322 origin of replication and ampicillinresistance gene, was purified by agarose 1 gel electrophoresis and recovered from the gel by a modification of the glass powder method Vogelstein, B. Gillespie, D., Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci. 76 615 619 1979 . The dT tailed DNA was further purified by absorption and elution from an oligo dA cellulose column as follows The DNA was dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.3 buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 M NaCl, cooled at OOC, and applied to an oligo dA cellulose column 0.6 by 2.5 cm equilibrated with the same buffer at OOC. The column was washed with the same buffer at 0OC and eluted with water at room temperature. The eluted DNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.3 with 1 mM EDTA. The oligo dG tailed linker DNA was prepared by digesting 75 ijg of pLi DNA with 20 U of PstI endonuclease in 450 ul containing 6 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 6 mM MgC12, 6 mM 2 ME, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.01 mg of BSA per ml. After 16 hr at 300C the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol CHC13 and the DNA was precipitated with alcohol. Tails of 10 to 15 deoxyguanylate dG residues were then added per end with 46 U of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in the same reaction mixture 38 ul as described above, except that 0.1 mM dGTP replaced dTTP.After 20 min. at 370C the mixture was extracted with phenol CHC13, and after the DNA was precipitated with ethanol it was digested with 35 U of HindIII endonuclease in 50 ul containing 20 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 7 mM MgC12, 60 mM Nail, and 0.1 mg of BSA at 370C for 4 hr. The small oligo dG tailed linker DNA was purified by agarose gel 1.8 electrophoresis and recovered as described above.2 . cDNA Library Preparation Step 1 cDNA synthesis. The reaction mixture 10 p1 contained 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 8.3, 8 mM MgC12, 30 mM KCl, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 20 uCi 32P dCTP 3000 Ci mmole , 6 ug polyA RNA from Con A induced LB2 1, 60 units RNasin Biotec, Inc., Madison, WI , and 2 ug of the vector primer DNA 15 pmol of primer end , and 45 U of reverse transcriptase.The reaction was incubated 60 min at 420Cnd then stopped by the addition of 1 ul of 0.25 M ETDA pH 8.0 and 0.5 ul of 10 SDS 40 ul of phenol CHCl3 was added, and the solution was blended vigorously in a Vortex mixer and then centrifuged. After adding 40 ul of 4 M ammonium acetate and 160 ul of ethanol to the aqueous phase, the solution was chilled with dry ice for 15 min., warmed to room temperature with gentle shaking to dissolve unreacted deoxynucleoside triphosphates that had precipitated during chilling, and centrifuged for 10 min. in an Eppendorf microfuge. The pellet was dissolved in 10 ul of 10mM Tris.HCl pH 7.3 and 1 mM EDTA, mixed with 10 ul of 4 M ammonium acetate, and reprecipitated with 40 ul of ethanol, a procedure which removes more than 99 of unreacted deoxynucleoside triphosphates. The pellet was rinsed with ethanol. Step 2 Oligodeoxycytidylate oligo dC addition. The pellet containing the plasmidcDNA mRNA was dissolved in 20 l of 140 mM sodium cacodylate 30 mM Tris.HCl pH 6.8 buffer containing 1 mM CoC12, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 ig of poly A , 70 uM dCTP, 5 uCi 32P dCTP, 3000 Ci mmole, and 60 U of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The reaction was carried out at 370C for 5 min. to permit the addition of 10 to 15 residues of dCMP per end and then terminated with 2 l of 0.25 M EDTA pH 8.0 and 1 ul of 10 SDS.After extraction with 20 l of phenol CHC13, the aqueous phase was mixed with 20 ul of 4 M ammonium acetate, the DNA was precipitated and reprecipitated with 80 ul of ethanol, and the final pellet was rinsed with ethanol. Step 3 HindIII endonuclease digestion. The pellet was dissolved in 30 ul of buffer containing 20 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 7 mM MgC12, 60 mM Nail, and 0.1 mg of BSA per ml and then digested with 10 U of HindIII endonuclease for 2 hr at 370C. The reaction was terminated with 3 ul of 0.25 M EDTA pH 8.0 and 1.5 ul of 10 SDS and, after extraction with phenol CHC13 followed by the addition of 30 l of 4 M ammonium acetate, the DNA was precipitated with 120 ul of ethanol. The pellet was rinsed with ethanol and then dissolved in 10 ul of 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.3 and 1 mMEDTA, and 3 ul of ethanol was added to prevent freezing during storage at 200C. Step 4 Cyclization mediated by the oligo dG tailed linker DNA. A 9 ul sample of the HindIII endonuclease digested oligo dC tailed cDNA mB4A plasmid about 90 of the sample was incubated in a mixture 90 ul containing 10 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.5, 1 mMEDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, and 1.8 pmol of the oligo dG tailed linker DNA at 650C for 5 min, shifted to 420C for 60 min, and then cooled to OOC. The mixture 90 1 was adjusted to a volume of 900 ul containing 20 mMTris.HCl pH 7.5, 4 mM MgC12 10 mM NH4 2SO4, 0.1 M KC1, 50 ijg of BSA per ml, and 0.1 mM ss NAD 6ug of E. coliDNA ligase were added and the solution was then incubated overnight at 120C. Step 5 Replacement of RNA strand by DNA. To replace the RNA strand of the insert, the ligation mixture was adjusted to contain 40 uM of each of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.15 mM S NAD, 4 iig of additional E. coli DNA ligase, 16 U of E. coli DNA polymerase I PolI, and 9 U of E. coli RNase H. This mixture 960 1all was incubated successively at 120C and room temperature for 1 hr each to promote optimal repair synthesis and nick translation by PolI. Step 6 Transformation of E. coli.Transformation was carried out using minor modifications of the procedure described by Cohen et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 69 2110 2114 1972 . E. coli K 12 strain MC1061 Casadaban, M. andCohen, S., J. Mol. Biol. 138 179 207 19801 was grown to 0.5 absorbancy unit at 600 nm at 370C in 20 ml of L broth. The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 10 ml of 10 mM Tris.HC1 pH 7.3 containing 50 mM Caul2, and centrifuged at OOC for 5 min. The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of the above buffer and incubated again at OOC for 5 min. then, 0.2 ml of the cell suspensions was mixed with 0.1 ml of theDNA solution step 5 and incubated at OOC for 15 min. Next the cells were kept at 370C for 2 min. and thereafter at room temperature for 10 min. then 0.5 ml of L broth was added, and the culture was incubated at 370C for 30 min., mixed with 2.5 ml of L broth soft agar at 420C, and spread over L broth agar containing 50 ug of ampicillin per ml. After incubation at 370C for 12 to 24 hr, individual colonies were picked with sterile tooth picks. In all, approximately 1 x 105 independent cDNA clones were generated.G. Size Fractionated Sub library 30 ijg of plasmid DNA representing the entire cDNA library pcD X DNA was digested separately with the restriction enzymes SalI, HindIII, and ClaI to linearize the plasmid. The restricted DNAs were size fractionated on a 1 agarose gel to separate plasmids having different size cDNA inserts. Segments were excised from the gel representing plasmids with cDNA inserts of the following size ranges 0 lkb 1 2kb 2 3kb 3 4kb 4 5kb 5 kb and longer. DNA was eluted from each gel slice using the glass powder method of Vogelstein and Gillespie Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 76 615 619 1970 . The eluted DNAs from the 3 digests were pooled on the basis of size, and treated with T4 ligase to recyclize in a total volume of 15 ijl containing 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM spermidine, 1 mM ATP and 100 ug ml BSA. The ligation reactions were incubated 16 hr at 120C. About 3 ul of each combined size fraction was used to transform E. coli strain MC 1061 using the method of Cohen, S. et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 69 2110 2114 1972 . A library of about 105 independent transformations was obtained for the fraction containing cDNA inserts 1 2 kb in 15 length. A collection of 104 independent clones were picked at random from the sublibrary enriched for cDNA inserts of 1 2 kb and propagated individually in wells of microtiter dishes containing 200 p1 L broth with ampicillin at 50 ug ml and dimethyl sulfoxide at 7 .H. Screening of 1 2 kb Sub library by DNA Transfections Pools containing 48 cDNA clones were prepared from the microtiter cultures. 58 such pools were grown up in 1 liter cultures of L broth containing 100 ug ml ampicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from each culture and purified by twice banding through CsCl gradients. The DNA representing each pool was transfected into COS 7 monkey cells as follows. One day prior to transfection, approximately 106 COS 7 monkey cells were seeded onto individual 60 mm plates in DME containing 10 fetal calf serum and 2 M glutamine. To perform the transfection, the medium was aspirated from each plate and replaced with 1.5 ml of DME containing 50 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 400 ug ml DEAE Dextran and 15 ug of the plasmid DNAs to be tested. The plates were incubated for four hours at 370C, then the DNA containing medium was removed, and the plates were washed twice with 2 ml of serum free DME. DME containing 150 uM chloroquine was added back to the plates which were then incubated for an additional 3 hrs at 370C. The plates were washed once with DME, and then DME containing 4 fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin was added. The cells were then incubated for 72 hrs at 370C. The growth medium was collected and assayed for murine IL 2 activity as described above. Four pools groups 6, 33, 40, and 56 yielded murine IL 2 activity see Table II below . Group 33 was then subdivided into 8 pools, each containing 6 of the original pools. Only one of these subpools group c was positive in the transfection assay. Each of the plasmids in group c was transfected individually intoCOS 7 cells. Only one clone, designated MT 18, was active in producing TCGF activity. Restriction mapping of the MT 18 cDNA clone identified a PstI HindIII fragment within the cDNA insert, as shown in Figure 2A. This fragment was purified by electrophoresis through a 5 poly acrylamide gel, and eluted. This fragment was labelled with 32P dCTP by nick translation according toManiatis, T. et al. Molecular Cloning, A LaboratoryManual , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, U.S.A. 1982 . The pools of 48 cDNA clones were transformed from the microtiter trays to nitrocellulose filters placed on plates of L agar 100 vg ml ampicillin. These plates were incubated overnight at 370C. The bacterial colonies were lysed and the DNA bound to the filters as described in Maniatis, T., et al. above . The nick translated PstI HindIII fragment from MT18 was hybridized with each of the 58 filters representing the pools. The hybridizations were performed in 6XSSPE 0.18 M Nail, lmM EDTA, and 10 mMNaH2PO4 pH 7.9 , 50 formamide, 100 pg ml E. coli tRNA, 0.1 SDS, at 420C overnight. The filters were washed once at room temperature in 2X SSPE 0.1 SDS, and then twice with 0.2X SSPE at 600C. Following incubation of the filters, 15 individual clones were found to hybridize with the probe. Plasmid DNA from each of these clones was prepared as described above, and transfected into COS 7 cells.Of these clones, only three, contained in pools 6 MT1 , 40 MT 20 , and 56 MT 28 produced high levels of murine IL 2 activity see Table II . Restriction analysis showed that the clones share essentially the same structure.

InFigure 2, transcription of the 816 bp cDNA insert contained in the pcD expression vector from the SV40 early promoter is indicated by the arrow. The locations of the splice donor and acceptor sites are shown. The polyadenylation signal, also derived from SV40, is located at the 3 end of the cDNA insert. The IL 2 coding region in the cDNA insert is heavily shaded while the non coding regions are lightly shaded. The remainder of the vector sequences are derived from pBR322, including the R lactamase gene AmpR and the origin of replication. Utilizing both the M13 dideoxy chain termination method Sanger, F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. U.S.A. 74 5463 5467 1977 and modifiedMaxam Gilbert technique Rubin, C. and Schmid, C.,Nucleic Acid Res. 8 4613 4619 1981 the MT 1 sequence was determined. The cDNA insert contains a single open reading frame. The first ATG is found 49 51 nucleotides from the 5 end, and is followed by 168 codons before the termination triplet at nucleotide positions 553 555.Figure 3 is a comparison between the putative mouse and human IL 2 protein sequences. Identical residues after alignment are shown in shaded boxes. Surprisingly, 89 of the predicted mouse IL 2 residues are conserved in human IL 2. The homolog ies between the mouse IL 2 cDNA and human IL 2 cDNA are also surprising. Overall, there is about 70 homoloqy between the two IL 2 cDNA sequences Brutlag, D. et 11., Nucleic Acids Res. 10 279 294 1981 . In part4icular, the regions covered by nucleotide positions 1 125, 229 354, and 416 680 share extensive horology with the corresponding regions of human IL 2 cDEA. However, the trinucleotide CAG sequence, which is repeated twelve times within the mouseIL 2 cDNA coding region, is not present in any human IL 2 cDNA isolated to date. The ,lone library in the pcD expression vector enabled the iqentification of complete cDNA clones by direct expression in mammalian cells. Specifically, complete mouse IL 2 cDNA clones were directly identified by transfecting COS 7 cells with randomly picked cDNA clones, and meauring the TCGF activity secreted into the cell supernatant. These results indicate that the identification of full length cDNA clones of lymphokines or hormones may be achieved solely on the basis of detection of a functional polypeptide in eukaryotic cells. Identification of relevant cDNA clones based on the functional expression of the gene offers advantages to hybrid selection procedures. Identification of cDNA clones by hybrid selection relies on nueleotide sequence homology between mRNA and cDNA inserts which can prove misleading. In fact, some of the functionally inactive cDNA clones which hybridized with the mouse IL 2 cDNA probe MT 3, MT 4,MT 5, MT 7, MT 17, MT 19, MT 21, MT 22, MT 23, and MT 29 in Table II have different restriction maps from that of the functional mouse IL 2 cDNA. Interestingly, these inactive clones also hybridized with El human IL 2 cDNA probe. Thus it is possible to isolate irrelevant clones on the basis of partial sequence homology among the cDNA inserts.Furthermore, the cloning protocol disclosed herein is particularly useful in cases where the large amounts of mRNA needed for hybrid selection are not available. The invention further provides a method of identifying individual nucleotide sequences coding for a polypeptide, said method comprising the steps of a locating a cellular source expressing the polypeptide b constructing from the cellular source a cDNA library composed of vectors, each vector containing a cDNA insert positioned to permit expression of the insert after incorporation into a eukaryotic cell c screening the library by transfecting or transforming eukaryotic cells with the vectors and assaying the eukaryotic cells for the presence of the polypeptide and d isolating the vector containing the cDNA insert encoding the polypeptide. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the cDNA clones of the present invention provide accurate and complete sequence data on murine IL 2. The invention also provides to those skilled in the art means for producing significant quantities of the factor essentially free from other hematopoietic factors for the improved in vitro maintenance of T cells and other hematopoietic cells. Further, the information gleaned from the cDNA clones increases understanding of the mammalian immune response, enhancing experimental research capabilities.
