# Purification of aqueous effluents.

## Abstract
Raw synthesis gases produced by the gasification of coal are treated to remove tars and oils by direct and indirect cooling to produce condensate streams which are treated under high pressure, viz 5 to 150 bar to rapidly separate out aqueous and organic phases. Elevated temperatures may then be used to further minimise residence time. The invention is further characterised in that the size of the separation vessels 5,6 is of several orders of magnitude smaller than used in conventional ambient pressure separa tion procedures.
