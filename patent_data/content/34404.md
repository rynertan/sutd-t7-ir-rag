# Friction clutches.

## Abstract
A friction clutch incorporates a flywheel 11 a driven plate 23 and pressure plate 16 with friction interfaces 24 and 25 between pairs of these members lubricated and or cooled by fluid flung out centrifugally. A generally bell shaped distribu tion member constituted by a conical member 41 and part of the driven plate hub member 33 directs fluid past the interface 25 to a passage leading outward to the interface 24. Apertures 47 around the circumference of the distribution member allow some fluid to escape through the distribution member through a radial passage to the interface 25. Substantially equal distribution of oil between the two interfaces is achieved.
