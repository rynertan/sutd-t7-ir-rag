## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to zinc rich coatings and more particularly to those containing a variety of film forming binders and aluminum trihydrate. Zinc rich coatings, such as, zinc rich thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers have been used for corrosion protection particularly in the automobile industry. Such coatings are also electrically conductive and so may be used where welding is used for assembling parts. Electrical spot welding is the preferred method of assembling automotive components. Zinc rich coatings would be more widely used if certain deficiencies were corrected. These include corrosion resistance particularly on unpassivated steel, welding spark fume hazards, and poor weld strength. Zinc coatings also tend to coat the electrodes of spot welders so that the number of repetitive welds produced on steel is reduced. Spot welding and arc welding of steel requires temperatures in excess of 1300 C in order to obtain a melt that will flow together to form a bond. The spark temperature developed during arc welding is often 2000 C or higher, while somewhat lower temperatures are su.ficieEt during spot welding since the electrode pressure aids the flow of the soft steel. In both cases, however, zinc has a tendency to volatilize in the weld area because zinc has a boiling point of 9l00C. This is encouraged by the nonoxidizing environment, which is produced by the weld flzlx and the physical protection mechanism of the spot welding electrodes. Welding, therefore, results in an expulsion of zinc vapor which then readily oxidizes to zinc oxide upon leaving the weld area. Aluminum trihydrate has been used in the past to improve the arc and arc track resistance of epoxy compositions intended for electrical applications.Normally, the arc or spark generated during an overvoltage causes carbonization on the surface of the epoxy resulting in a conductive path and producing a short circuit. The presence of aluminum trihydrate in the formulation eliminates the formation of the conductive carbon track. The mechanism postulated is that the water released by the aluminum hydrate at the arc temperature oxidizes the carbon to gaseous components. The actual mechanism has not been defined although it has been discussed in U.S. 2,997,526 and U.S. 2,997,527. The description of the test method for evaluating inclined plane tracking under arc conditions can be found in ASTM D 2303 68. It is an object of this invention to impart such properties as reduced spark spatter, improved weld strength, and reduced electrode fouling in zinc rich thermoplastic polyhydroxyether coatings. It is another object of this invention co impart the properties of the preceding paragraph to zinc rich coatings containing film forming binders other than thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a further reading of the specification.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A satisfactory metal coating composition meeting the above described electrical criteria has been provided by a composition comprising A a film forming binder B about 350 to about 1450 parts by weight, per hundred parts of film forming binder, of zinc pigment C about 3 to about 100 parts by weight, per hundred parts of film forming binder, of aluminum trihydrate D O to about 35 parts by weight, per hundred parts of film forming binder, of a heat hardened resole phenol aldehyde con densation resin and E O to about 20 parts by weight, per hundred parts of film forming binder, of a suspending agent. The term film forming binder as used in this invention means any organic material which will form a zinc rich coating on metallic substrates to improve corrosion resistance, particularly on unpassivated steel, as well as welding properties. Preferred film forming binders for use in this invention include thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers, low, intermediate and high molecular weight epoxy resins, epoxy ester resins, alkyl silicates, phenolic resins cured with intermediate molecular weight epoxy resins, isocyanate cured thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers, chlorinated rubbers, vinyl chloride resins, poly bisphenol A formal and the like.

Figure 2 A and B is a Scanning Electron Yicrograph at 100 OX magnification of zinc rich thermoplastic polyhydroxyether coatings without aluminum trihydrate and containing aluminum trihydrate exposed to salt spray for 100 hours. Figure 3 is a Scanning Electron Micrograph at 600X magnification of a spot welding electrode face which has been exposed to the welding of a zinc rich thermoplastic polyhydroxyether coating. The term thermoplastic polyhydroxyether herein refers to substantially linear polymers having the general formula EMI4.1 wherein D is the radical residuum of a dihydric phenol, E is an hydroxyl containing radical residuum of an epoxide and n represents the degree of polymerization and is at least 30 and is preferably 80 or more. The term thermoplastic polyhydroxyether is intended to include mixtures of at least two thermoplastic polyhydroxyethers. The thermoplastic poly hydroxyethers can be prepared by admixing from about 0.985 to about 1.015 moles of an epihalohydrin with one mole of a dihydric phenol together with from about 0.6 to 1.5 moles of an alkali metal hydroxide, such as, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide generally in an aqueous medium at a temperature of about 100 to about 500C until at least about 60 mole percent of the epihalohydrin has been consumed. The thermoplastic poly hydroxyethers thus produced have reduced viscosities of at least 0.43. Reduced viscosity values were computed by use of the equation EMI5.1 wherein to is the efflux tine of the solvent tetrahydrofuran, t5 is the efflux time of the poly hydroxyether solution, c is the concentration of the poly hydroxy ether solution in terms of grams of poly hydroxyether per 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran.

Particularly desirable dihydric polyrruclear phenols have the formulaEMI8.1 wherein Y and Y1 are as previously defined, r and z have values from 0 to 4 inclusive and R1 is a divalent saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, particularly alkylene and alkylidene radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and cycloalkylene radicals having up to and including 10 carbon atoms. Mixtures of dihydric phenols can also be employed and whenever the term dihydric phenol or dihydric polynuclear phenol is used herein, mixtures of these compounds are intended to be included. The epoxide contributing the hydroxyl containing radical residuum, E, can be monoepoxide or diepoxide. By epoxide is meant a compound containing an oxirane group, i.e., oxygen bonded to two vicinal aliphatic carbon atoms, thus,EMI9.1 A monoepoxide contains one such oxirane group and provides a radical residuum E containing a single hydroxyl group, a diepoxide contains two such oxirane groups and provides a radical residuum E containing two hydroxyl groups.Saturated epoxides, by which term is meant diepoxides free of ethylenic unsaturation, i.e., z C C and acetylenic unsaturation, i.e, C C , are preferred.Particularly preferred are halogensubstituted saturated monoepoxides, i.e., the epihalohydrins and saturated diepoxides which contain solely carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, especially those wherein the vicinal or adjacent carbon atoms form a part of an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Oxygen in such diepoxides can be, in addition to oxirane oxygen, ether oxygen 0 , oxacarbonyl oxygenEMI9.2 carbonyl oxygenEMI9.3 and the like. Specific examples of monoepoxides include ep ichlorohydrins such as ep ichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin, 1,2 epoxy 1 methyl 3 chlororopane, 1,2 epoxy 1 butyl 3chloropropane, 1,2 epoxy 2 methyl 3 fluoropropane, and the like. Illustrative diepoxides include diethylene glycol bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate , bis 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl methyl adipate, bis 3, 4 epoxycyclohexyl methyl phthalate, 6 methyl 3,4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl 6 methyl 3,4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, t chloro 3,4 epoxycylohexylmethyl 2chloro 3,4 epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, diglycidyl ether, bis 2 33 epoxycyclopentyl ether, 1,5 pentanediol bis 4 methyl 3,4 epoxcyclohexyl methyl ether, bis 2,3 epoxy 2 ethylhexyl adipate, diglycidyl maleate, diglycidyl phthalate, 3 oxa tetracyclo 4.4.0.17,10.02,41 undec 8 yI 2 ,3 epoxypropyl ether, bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentyl sulfone, bis 3,4 epoxyhexoxypropyl sulfone, 2,2 sulfonyldienthyl, bis 2,3 epoxycyclopentanecarboxylate , 3 oxatetracyclo 4.4.0.17,10.0ê,4 undec 8 yl 2,3 epoxybutyrate 4 pentenal di 6 methyl 3,4 epoxycyclohexylmethyl acetal, ethylene glycol bis 9,10 epoxystearate , diglycidyl carbonate, bis 2,3 epoxybutylpenyl 2 ethylhexyl phosphate, diepoxydioxane, butadiene dioxide, and 2 ,3 dimethyl butadiene dioxide. The preferred diepoxides are those wherein each of the oxirane groups is connected to an electron donating substituent which is not immediately connected to the carbon atoms of that oxirane group.Such diepoxides having the groupingEMI10.1 wherein A is an electron donating substituent such as 0 , EMI10.2 and Q is a saturated hydrocarbon radical such as an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl radical. The zinc pigment used in this invention is commercially available and preferably has a particle size of about 2 to about 15 microns. It is preferred to use zinc pigment having an average particle size of 6 7 microns. The resole phenol aldehyde condensation products which can be used in this invention are produced by the condensation of phenols and aldehydes under alkaline conditions. A resole produced by the condensation of a phenol with formaldehyde most likely proceeds through an intermediate having the following illustrated type structure EMI11.1 In a typical synthesis, resoles are prepared by heating one mole of phenol with about 1.5 moles of formaidehyde using sodium or barium hydroxide as a catalyst, although any phenolic compound, or a mixture of phenolic compounds having two or three reactive aromatic ring hydrogen positions, can be used with an aldehyde or aldehyde liberating compound capable of undergoing phenol aldehyde condensation.Illustrative of phenolic compounds are cresol, xylenol, ethylphenol, butylphenol, isopropylmethoxyphenol, chlorophenol, reco rcinol, hydroquinone, naphthol, 2,2 bis p hydroxyphenol propane, and the like. Illustrative of aldehydes are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, crontonaldehyde, furfural, and the like. Illustrative of aldehyde liberating compounds are for example, paraformaldehyde, formalin and 1,3,5 trioxane. Ketones such as acetone are also capable of condensing with the phenolic compounds, as are methylene engendering agents such as hexamethylenetetramine, and are contemplated as useful for preparing the resole resins in this invention. The condensation of phenolic compound and aldehyde, can of course, be conducted in the presence of other aLkaline reagents such as sodium carbonate, sodium acetate, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide and the like, if desired. When the condensation reaction is completed, if desired, the water and other volatile materials can be removed by distillation, and the catalyst neutralized. The most suitable resole resins are those which are brought to an advanced state of cure, but are still heat reactive. These resins are insoluble in water, readily soluble in conventional organic solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, methanol, ethanol, and the like. Resole resins having a particularly desirable combination of properties are those which have an average molecular weight in the range between about 350 and 600. Where suspending agents are used their nature is not critical and thus one can employ low molecular weight polyolefins, silane treated pyrogenic silica, quarternary amine treated hydrous magnesium aluminum silicate, and the like. Suitable solvents are used in applying the coating composition to the particular metallic substrate. The solvents used depend upon the nature of the application method. Thus for example, in spray coating it has been found useful to employ a mixture containing an aliphatic ketone having about 3 to 6 carbons and aromatic hydrocarbons containing about 7 to 9 carbons plus optional aliphatic alcohols containing about 3 to 5 carbons, and the like.For roller type applications one can use a mixture ofCellosolve acetate and aromatic hydrocarbons containing 7 to 12 carbons, and the like. It is convenient to use glycol esters such as Cellosolve acetate, the acetate of a monoalkyl glycol ether sold under the Trademark Cello solve byUnion Carbide Corporation . The preferred polyhydroxyether is available commercially as Bakelite Phenoxy PKHH, a trade designation of Union Carbide Corporation for condensation polymer derived from bisphenol A 2,2 bis phydroxyphenyl propane and epichlorohydrin having the structural formula EMI13.1 The phenoxy resin is available as a solution in glycol esters such as Cellosolve acetate the acetate of a monoalkyl glycol ether sold under the Trademar Cellosolve by Union Carbide Corporation or in pellet form which is readily soluble in a variety of solvents and solvent blends.The solid phenoxy resin sold under the designationPKHH by Union Carbide Corporation is soluble in the following solvents butyl Carbitol, butyl Carbitol acetate, butyl Cellosolve, Carbitol solvent, Cellosolve acetate1Cellosolve solvent, diacetone alcohol, dimethyl Carbitol, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, dioxane, ethoxy triglycol, mesityl oxide, methyl Cellosolve acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, and tetrahydrofuran. Carbitol is a Trademark of Union CarbideCorporation for the monoalkyl ether of diethylene glycol. Suitable polyisocyanate reactants useful for hardening phenoxy resins employed in zinc rich phenoxy coatings are polymeric isocyanates having units of the formula EMI14.1 where R is hydrogen and or lower alkyl having 1 to about 4 carbons and i has an average value of at least 2.1.Preferably the lower alkyl radical is methyl and i has an average value of from 2.1 to about 3.0. Particularly useful polyisocyanates of this type are the polyphenyl methylene polyisocyanates produced by phosgenation of the polyamine obtained by the acid catalyzed condensation of aniline with formaldehyde. Polyphenylmethylene isocyanates of this type are available commercially under such trade names as PAPI, NIAX, Isocyanate AFPI, Mondur MR,Isonate 390P, NCO 120, Thanate P 200, NCO 10 and NCO 20. mPa. s These products are low viscosity 50 500 centipoise at 250 C liquids having average isocyanato functionalities in the range of about 2.25 to about 3.2 or higher, depending upon the specific aniline to formaldehyde molar ratio used in the polyamine preparation. High molecular weight epoxy resins arecom mercially available from Shell Oil Company. Their preparation is described in U.S. 3,177,090 issued toR. E. Bayes et al. Alkyl silicates are produced by the reaction of silicon tetrachloride and alcohols or alkoxy alcohols, generally in a reactor equipped with a stirrer, condenser and vat scrubber. The hydrogen chloride by product is removed at atmospheric pressure. Through this process, the most common products TEOS tetraethyl orthosilicate and Cellosolve silicate are made. Cellosolve is a Trademark of Union Carbide Corporation for monoalkyl ethers of ethylene glycol. Poly bisphenol A formals can be made by the interaction of bisphenol A with methylene dichloride, CH2C12 in the presence of base and dimethyl sulfoxide Is0 . In a typical preparation a charge comprising Comoonent Molar Amount 45.66 g. Bisphenol A 0.2 mole 120 cc. DMSO 15.45 g. of 52.37. aqueous NaOH 0.202 mole 22.14 g. of 51.2 aqueous KOH 0.202 mole 30 cc. Toluene was mixed under nitrogen and the water was then removed while heating to reflux by azeotropic distillation. The mixture was cooled to 85 900C and a solution of 17.0 g 0.2 mole of methylene chloride in 20 cc. of DMSO was added over a period of 80 minutes. The temperature was raised to 90950C for 0.5 hours and to 1000C for 0.25 hours. At this point the viscosity of the mixture became quite high.Methyl chloride was bubbled through the mixture for 30 minutes. The mixture was diluted with 250 cc. of toluene and filtered to remove salt. The filtrate was charged to a Warning Blender containing an excess of isopropyl al cohol to coagulate and recover the bisphenol poly formal as a powder. The reduced viscosity of the polymer thus synthesized was 0.99 when measured in chloroform as a 0.2 solution was 0.5. Epoxy esters can be made from unsaturated oil acids as disclosed in U.S. 2,502,518 issued to Greenlee et al. and from oil acids low in unsaturation, such as tall oils, as disclosed in U.S. 2,493,486 issued to Greenlee. Examples of epoxy esters from linseed fatty acid and coconut fatty acid are described in EpoxyResins by H. Lee et al. page 286, McCraw Hill BookCo. Inc., NYC, 1957. Conventional epoxy resins of varying molecular weights and various curing agents therefor including phenolic resins and polyaminoamides are delineated in Epoxy Resins by H. Lee et al. at pages 155 157 and 166 172 respectively and the Handbook ofEpoxy Resins by H. Lee et al., McGraw Hill Book Co. Inc., NYC 1967 , pages 2 3 and 2 9 respectively. Phenolic resins including both resoles and novolaks are described in Polymer Processes, C. E.Schildknecht, pages 295 350, Interscience Publishers Inc.,NYC, 1956. The aluminum trihydrate used in this invention should preferably have a particle size which is about 1 5 to about 1 10 that of the zinc pigment in order to provide optimum packing properties of the zinc particles with the aluminum trihydrate particles. This provides better film integrity of the final coating and at the same time reduces the porosity of the film which minimizes penetration of the film by corrosive aqueous solutions.A preferred particle size range of the aluminum trihydrate used in this invention is about 0.25 microns to about 15 microns. A particularly preferred range is about 0.5 to about 1 micron. While about 350 to about 1450 parts by weight, per 100 parts of film forming binder, of zinc pigment can be used, it is preferred to use about 400 to about 1300 parts by weight of zinc pigment and even more preferred to use about 410 to about 1000 parts by weight of zinc pigmenc. While one can use about 3 to about 100 parts by weight, per 100 parts of film forming binder of aluminum trihydrate, it is preferred to use about 25 to about 90 parts by weight of aluminum trihydrate and even more preferred about 30 to about 70 parts by weight of aluminum trihydrate. Electrical Properties The electrical conductivities of aluminum trihydrate pigments were measured in order to determine their potential in weldable coatings. The conductance of a composite is dependent upon the electrical conductivity of the bulk material, its surface resistance and the magnitude of the organic insulating layer encapsulating the particles. Shape also is important since it determines the lumber of current paths. Since the determination of electrical conductivity of a pigment in a coating is subject to the many variables mentioned above, the laboratory measurenexts were made on dry pigment. The test procedure was as follows. The measurement procedure involved a determination of the electrical resistivity of the test powders using a Wheatstone Bridge. The apparatus used included a General Radio 1644 A Megohm Bridge and a test cell made from a polystyrene Petri dish with cover.The top and bottom of the Petri dish are each centrally drilled for a No. 4 brass screw and washer which holds 10 mil copper discs which function as electrodes. The lower dish has an internal diameter of 8.7 cm, a depth of 1.3 cm and a volume of 77.3 cc. The following procedure was used. The lower dish electrode assembly was filled to over flowing with the powder to be tested. The excess powder was displaced by placing the cover electrode dish over the lower dish. A cork cylinder was placed on top of the cover so that a 500 gram weight could be centrally located on the cell and still permit making electrical contact with leads from the test cell and the megohm bridge.Resistivity measurements were then made using a 20 volt source. The reading in megohms was then converted to ohms cc. or ohms cm using the procedure of ASTM D 257. The volume resistivity of various grades of aluminum trihydrate also known as aluminum hydrate, hydrated alumina or aluminum hydroxide, A1 OH 3 are presented in Table and compared with zinc powder and other typical coating pigments. It may be noted that both 1 2 micron hydrated alumina Hydral 705 and 1 micron Hydral 710 have electrical resistivities that are lower than the ZincDust Pigment L 15 and therefore will not degrade the electrical conductivity and electrical welding properties of zinc rich coatings modified with them. Alcoa Z 331 6 7 micron hydrated alumina pigment , however, has a higher resistivity and is not as desirable. A widely used corrosion inhibitive pigment, zinc phosphate, has a resistivity that is two orders of magnitude higher than zinc. Hydral 710 with its 1 micron particle size was used in the examples because it should provide good particle packing properties with the 6 8 micron zinc dust because a particle diameter ratio of 1 to 5 is considered optimum.

The invention is further described in the Examples which follow. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES 1 6 and CONTROLS A C Zinc Rich Phenoxy Coatings Corrosion resistance was demonstrated by using aluminum trihydrate HydralAlcoa 710 to to modify zinc rich phenoxy coatings at three different zinc levels. Twenty volume percent of the hydrated alumina was used to replace an equal volume of zinc or was. added to the existing level of zinc in the Controls. The effect of the modification was then determined on salt spray resistance using unpassivated cold rolled steel panels. Table 2 summarizes the forulations and shows that the substitution or addition of hydrated alumina to the zinc rich coating results in significant improvements in corrosion resistance. The corrosion resistance i provement was unexpected since aluminum trihydrate is not noted as a corrosion inhibitive pigment. The prior art contains no eop,lanation of how the hydrated alumina interacts with the zinc to provide good corrosion resistance. Scanning electron micrographs, however, provide some information on the physical properties of the corro sion products of the examples containing aluminum tri hydrate versus the Control where zinc alone is used.

Examination of Figure 1 shows the presence of thread like deposits on the surface of the mixtures containing aluminum trihydrate which are absent in formulations containing only zinc. Higher magnification 1OOOX in Figure 2 provides more evidence of a multitude of small thread like structures on the zinc alumina trihydrate coating. The new surface structure may be expected to have better barrier properties than the formulation containing zinc alone. The thread like structure seen resembles aluminum hydroxide formed on corroding aluminum. The welding properties of the Examples andControls were demonstrated by evaluating spark spatter and weld strength of coated steel specimens with aModel CSS Mark 4, Type OOAH 15 kva spot welder using a 4 cycle welding interval and a 50 cycle hold or cooling 6.35 period. Water cooled electrodes were used having a 1 4 3.175 mm diameter with an 1 8 tip and a 45 taper. The following conditions were used HzWelding Tine 4 cycles of 60 cycle sec currentPhase Shift Heat Control 60 Hold Time 50 cyclesGage Clamping Pressure 75 psi 51.75 N mm2Clamp Force 100 pounds 45 kgElectrode Face Pressure 8150 psi 5623.5 N mm2 The data in Table 3 demonstrates that spark spatter is decreased and welding strength increased when hydrated alumina is substituted for or added to zinc rich phenoxy coatings. The spark spatter data is the result of visual observations during welding. Weld strength was determined by placing the composites under torsion until broken by hand. These are relative values showing significant differences. The weld ntlgget was also examined and found to be cleaner and better shaped when the aluminum trihydrate formulations were used.A similar observation was made on the copper welding electrodes. The aluminum trihydrate formulations provided less buildup or bonding. It may be inferred from this that the zinc oxide formed has less of a tendency to stick to the copper electrodes than due the zinc metal particles which can alloy with the copper. A scanning electron micrograph Figure 3 shows that the spherical particles of metallic zinc tend to imbed themselves into the face of the copper electrode.
