# Method and apparatus for determining the nearness to criticality of a nuclear reactor.

## Abstract
The approach to criticality of a nuclear reactor provided with an artificial neutron is monitored by two neutron directors, one which measures the neutron flux in a localized region around the artificial neutron source, and the other lo cated similarly with respect to the core geometry but removed from the localized region. When the reactor is subcritical, the artificial source dominates and the outputs of the two detec tors are noticeably different. At the reactor approaches criti cality, the critical mode distribution of neutrons, which is sym metrical with respect to the two detectors, becomes dominant and the detector outputs approach each other in magnitude. The ratio of the output signals therefore, provides an indication of the reactor reactivity state. Either linear or logarithmic ratio signals can be generated, and if desired, either can be com pared with an appropriately scaled reference signal representa tive of a selected reactivity state, such as a multiplication fac tor of 0.99, with the result of the comparison used to control a near criticality not near criticality logic output.
