## Description
The present invention relates a new pigment composition and, more particularly, to a pigment composition useful as a coloring material such as paint, printing ink, or a synthetic resin colorant in which a phosphonic ester compound containing a polyester chain is used as the pigment dispersant or flushing agent. EP A 127325 discloses a dispersing agent useful for the preparation of pigments dispersions for use in paints, especially thermosetting paints. The dispersing agent contains in its molecular formula a divalent aliphatic radical and residues of a polyester chain or a polyisocyanate, wherein at least 30 of the total number of residues carry an epoxy group. Relevant under Art. 54 3 EPC is the reference EP A 0 164 817 which inter alia describes surfactants based on a terminal esterified polyester compound containing a phosphate group. In a further conventional process for producing paints and printing inks, lecithin, which is one of phospholipids, has been used both as a dispersant for dispersing a pigment into a paint vehicle and printing ink varnish, or as a flushing agent for flushing the aqueous filter cake into an oil vehicle or oil varnish. Being a natural phospholipid, lecithin is liable to oxidation and rancidity which lead to deterioration and putrefaction. Thus there has been a demand for a dispersant or flushing agent which is stabler and better than lecithin. In view of the above mentioned drawbacks of the conventional dispersant or flushing agent and in order to develop a new compound which is compatible with vehicles and varnishes and also with pigments and is useful as a pigment dispersant, the present inventors carried out a series of researches which led to the finding that a phosphoric ester obtained by reacting a polyester having a hydroxyl group with phosphoric acid exhibits outstanding properties and effects required for pigment dispersants. The present invention was completed based on this finding. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pigment composition comprised of pigment and a dispersant, characterized in that the dispersant is a phosphoric ester compound represented by the formula below wherein one or more than one of the three R s are residues of hydroxyl terminated polyester, obtained by self condensation of a hydroxy carboxylic acid of 4 to 30 carbon atoms, optionally followed by esterification of the terminal carboxyl group with an alcohol The dispersant which characterizes the pigment composition of this invention is a specific phosphoric ester compound as defined above. The phosphoric ester compound used in this invention can be obtained by various methods. According to a preferred method, it is obtained by reacting 1 mole of an ester forming phosphorus compound with 3 moles, 2 moles, or 1 mole of a hydroxyl terminated polyester obtained by self polycondensation of a hydroxy carboxylic acid. It is also possible to produce the phosphoric ester compound used in this invention by the process is which 1 mole of an ester forming phosphorus compound is reacted with 1 to 3 moles of hydroxy carboxylic acid or lower alcohol ester thereof as a monomer and the resulting ester of phosphoric acid and hydroxy carboxylic acid undergoes chain growth with the same or different hydroxy carboxylic acid monomer and or hydroxyl terminated polyester. When 1 mole of an ester forming phosphorus compound is reacted with 3 moles of a hydroxyl terminated polyester, there is obtained a phosphoric ester compound in which all of the three R s in the above formula are a hydroxyl terminated polyester residues. Also, when 1 mole of an ester forming phosphorus compound is reacted with 2 moles or 1 mole of hydroxyl terminated polyester, there is obtained a phosphoric ester compound in which one or two of the three R s in the above formula are hydroxyl terminated polyester residues. Among the ester forming phosphorus compounds that can be used in this invention are phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus pentoxide, phosphorus trichloride, phosphoric anhydride, and acetyl phosphate. Perferable among them is phosphorus oxychloride. The reaction of the above mentioned ester forming phosphrous compound with a hydroxyl terminated polyester should preferably be carried out in an organic solvent which is both inert to the reactants and reaction products and solubilizes them. Examples of such organic solvents include aliphatic saturated hydrocarbons such as octane, petroleum ether, ligroin, mineral spirit, and kerosene aromatic hydro carbons such as benzene, toluene, and xylene halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethane and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons such as dichlorobenzene and trichloro benzene. They have been used for the production of polyesters. In the case where a halogenated phosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychloride is used as the ester forming phosphorus compound, it is desirable to use as a catalyst a tertiary amine such as triethylamine an organic base such as pyridine, 2,6 lutidine, and 1,8 diaza bicyclo 5.4.O undecene 7 or an inorganic base such as oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and organic acid salts of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals. In the case where one or two of the three R s in the above formula are hydrogen atoms or cations mentioned later , a cation source mentioned later should be added to the reaction mixture to form a salt when the reaction of an ester forming phosphorus compound with 1 mole or 2 moles of hydroxyl terminated polyester is substantially complete, or after the hydrolysis is performed as required in the case where a halogenated phosphorus compound is used as an ester forming phosphorus compound . The cation source may be added before, during, or after the production of the pigment composition of this invention using the phosphoric ester compound of the above mentioned formula, which has one or two hydroxyl terminated polyester residues, with the remaining R s being hydrogen ions. The molecular weight of the hydroxyl terminated polyester used in the above mentioned reaction is not critical. A dimer or a polymar having an average molecular weight lower than 10,000, preferably about 500 to 5,000, can be used. The hydroxyl terminated polyester as mentioned above is obtained by self polycondensation of a hydroxy carboxylic acid which has both a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group on the molecule. The hydroxy carboxylic acids is one which has 4 to 30 carbon atoms. Examples of such hydroxy carboxylic acid include ricinoleic acid, 12 hydroxy stearic acid, castor oil fatty acid, hydrogenated castor oil fatty acid δ hydroxy valeric acid, ε hydroxy caproic acid, p hydroxyethyloxybenzoic acid, and 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid. They may be used individually or in combination with one another. It is also possible to use, in the same manner a hydroxyl terminated polyester obtained by esterifying an alcohol with the terminal carboxyl group of a polyester obtained from the above mentioned hydroxy carboxylic acid. Examples of the alcohol used for the terminal esterification are alcohols having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, propyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, octyl alcohol, decyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, octadecyl alcohol, tetracosyl alcohol, hexacosyl alcohol, ostadecenyl alcohol, cyclohexyl alcohol, and benzyl, alcohol. The phosphoric ester compound used as a dispersant in this invention is obtained by reacting 3 moles, 2 moles, or 1 mole of the above mentioned hydroxyl terminated polyester with 1 mole of the above mentioned ester forming phosphorus compound. Where 2 moles or 1 more of the above mentioned polyester is reacted with 1 mole of the phosphorus compound, one or two R s other than polyester residues in the above mentioned formula may be groups other than the above mentioned polyester, such as residues of alcohol compounds, hydrogen atoms, inorganic cations, or organic cations. Examples of the alcohol residues are the residues of the above mentioned ordinary alcohols, the hydroxy carboxylic acid above mentioned as the monomer and hydroxyl ester of the above mentioned alcohol and the above mentioned hydroxyl carboxylic acid. Examples of inorganic cations include alkaline metals such as sodium and potassium polyvalent metals such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, aluminum, and tin and ammonium. Examples of organic cations include cations of primary, secondary, and tertiary monoamines and polyamines having 1 to 30 carbon atoms such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, hexylamine, octylamine, dodecylamine, octadecylamine, oleylamine, diethylamine, dibutylamine, distearylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, dimethyloctylamine, dimethyldecylamine, dimethyldodecylamine, dimethyltetradecylamine, dimethylhexadecylamine, dimethyloctadecylamine, dimethyloleylamine, dilaurylmonomethylamine, trioctylamine, dimethylaniline, ethylenediamine, propylene diamine, hexamethylenediamine, and stearylpropylenediamine quaternary ammoniums such as ostadecyl trimethylammonium and dioctadecyl dimethylammonium and alkanolamines such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dimethylethanolamine, diethylethanolamine, propanolamine, and other alkanolamines obtained by adding ethylene oxide to the above mentioned higher aliphatic amine. These amines can be used individually or in combination with one another. Where a higher aliphatic amine or ammonium derived from natural oils and fats is used as a raw material, it is possible to use a mixture of amines each differing in carbon number and degree of saturation as such.

These pigments are used in the form of dry fine powder, aqueous filter cake, or aqueous suspension. The pigment composition of this invention is prepared by compounding 100 parts by weight of the above mentioned pigment and 1 to 300 parts by weight, preferably 3 to 150 parts by weight, of the above mentioned phosphoric ester compound. Needless to say, these two components are incorporated with a known proper organic solvent, aqueous or oily paint vehicle, aqueous or oily printing ink varnish, aqueous or oily coating vehicle, thermoplastic resin, thermosetting resin, plasticizer, crosslinking agent, and catalyst.

These essential components and optional components can be mixed and dispersed by any known method using a ball mill, sand mill, attritor, continuous horizontal medium dispersing machine, two roll mill, three roll mill, pressure kneader, Banbury mixer, or extruder. In the case where a pigment in the form of an aqueous filter cake or aqueous suspension is used, the pigment composition of this invention can be prepared by the flushing method. According to this method, the pigment is transferred from the aqueous phase to the organic solvent phase by mixing the pigment with the comparatively hydrophobic dispersant among the dispersant used in this invention, alone or, preferably, in the form of a solution in a hydrophobic organic solvent which may contain a binder for ink or paint .

The phosphoric ester compound containing a polyester chain which is used in the present invention is not in danger of deterioration and putrefaction due to oxidation and rancidity, unlike lecithin as a natural phospholipid, which has been conventionally used as a pigment dispersant for paints, printing inks, and plastics colorants, It has good stability and produces an outstanding effect in the surface modification of pigments and the dispersion of pigments in a medium. The phosphoric ester compound of this invention is readily adsorbed on the pigment surface due to the electronic attraction produced by the phosphoric ester linkage and the ester linkage contained therein and the affinity for mediums produced by the hydrocarbon chain contained therein. This adsorption improves the wettability, dispersibility, and flowability of pigments. In addition, the phosphoric ester compound is useful as a flushing agent for the aqueous filter cake of pigment. It makes the pigment surface lipophilic or hydrophobic, permitting effective flushing of pigments. The invention is now described in more detail with reference to Referential Examples production of the phosphoric ester compound and Working Examples. In examples, quantities are expressed as parts by weight or percent by weight. Into a four mouth glass reactor equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser with a moisture distilling tube, and inlet and placed in an oil bath were charged 100 parts of 12 hydroxystearic acid and 100 parts of toluene, followed by stirring for dissolution. After heating, there was added 1.0 part of p toluenesulfonic acid as a polycondensation catalyst. The reaction liquid was heated to 120 C to promote the polycondensation of 12 hydroxystearic acid. The progress of the reaction was measured by means of the volume of distilled water and the infrared absorption spectrum of the reaction product after the lapse of 60 minutes, 120 minutes, and 180 minutes. After 200 minutes, the polycondensation reaction was terminated by cooling. When the reactants were cooled to 63 C, there were added 50 parts of methanol, 100 parts of methyl acetate, and 0.5 parts of p toluene sulfonic acid. The reactants ware heated to 110 C, with distillation of the solvent, to perform the methylesterification of the terminal carboxyl group of the polyester. When 150 parts of solvent had been distilled away, the reactants were cooled to 63 C. Then 200 parts of methanol were added and the solvent was distilled away by heatng to 110 C. The total amount distilled away was 245 parts. The methylesterification took about 5 hours. After the reaction, 300 parts of water were added to the reaction mixture to extract water soluble components from the reaction mixture. The oil layer was collected from the separating two layers. For dehydration of the oil phase, 150 parts of toluene and 200 parts of methanol ware added, followed by heating to 130 C with blowing of nitrogen gas. Thus, water and solvents, 345 parts in total, were distilled away. The reaction product thus obtained was an amber liquid. It was identified a methyl ester of as a self polycondensation polyester of 12 hydroxystearic acid by the infrared absorption spectrum and gel permeation chromatograph. It was confirmed by the acid value of the reaction product that the methylesterifiaction of the terminal carboxyl group of the polyester was almost complete. The hydroxyl value of the reaction product was 40.8. This indicates that 1 gram equivalent of the methyl ester of the self polycondensation polyester of 12 hydroxystearic acid is 1,375 and the avarage degree of polycondensation is about 5. Into a four mouth glass reactor equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser and placed in a water bath were charged 188.2 parts of the methyl ester of the polyester obtained in the above mentioned step 1 1 gram equivalent was 1,375 , 188.2 parts of benzene, and 16.6 parts of triethylamine, followed by stirring and dissolution. The dropping funnel was filled with 7.0 parts of phosphorus oxychloride. The equivalent ratio of the hydroxyl terminated polyester, phosphorus oxychloride, and triethylamine was 3 3 3.6. While stirring and cooling the reaction mixture below 10 C , phosphorus oxychloride was added dropwise from the dropping funnel over 30 minutes. After addition, the reaction was continued for 2 hours with stirring, followed by cooling. For the removal of triethylamine as a dehydrochlorination catalyst and triethylamine hydrochloride, the reaction mixture was washed with an equal amount of deionized water, half an amount of water acidified with hydrochloric acid, and three times with half an amount of deionized water using a separatory funnel. The washed benzene layer was dried with sodium sulfate and benzene was distilled away under vacuum. Thus there was obtained a brown liquid reaction porduct. The reaction product was identified as a phosphoric triester compound of the methyl ester of the self polycondensation polyester of 12 hydroxy stearic acid by the infrared absorption spectrum and gel permeation chromatograph.

With the reactor cooled with iced water, the benzene solution was added dropwise at 5 to 10 C. The reactants were stirred at 10 C for 1 hour. The reactor was gradually evacuated while increasing the reaction temperature. Hydrogen chloride gas formed by the reaction was absorbed by an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide filled in the absorbing bottle. The reaction temperature was gradually raised to 40 C and the reaction system was gradually evacuated to 100 mmHg over 5 hours. When the evolution of hydrogen chloride gas was not noticed any longer, the reaction system was cooled. In this state, the reaction system contains phosphoric methyl ester of poly 12 hydroxystearic acid monoester dichloride. The dropping funnel was filled with 62.8 parts of the above mentioned methyl ester of the polyester, 62.8 parts of benzene, and 4.62 parts of triethylamine, followed by mixing and dissolution. The resulting solution at 10 to 20 C was added dropwise to the reactor over 60 minutes, followed by stirring for 2 hours. The reaction temperature was raised to 40 C over 2 hours, and stirring was continued for 2 hours. The reactor was cooled. The equivalent ratio of the hydroxyl terminated polyester, phosphorus oxychloride, and triethylamine was 2 3 1. The reaction liquid was washed with water, a dilute aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, a dilute aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and water, for the dechlorination hydrolysis of the phosphoric ester chloride and removal of chloride and the removal of triethylamine hydrochloride. The washed benzene layer was dried with sodium sulfate, and benzene was distilled, away under reduced pressure. Thus there was obtained a brown liquid reaction product. It was confirmed by infrared absorption spectrum and gel permeation chromatograph that the reaction product is composed mainly of a phosphoric diester compound of the methyl ester of the self polycondensation polyester of 12 hydroxystearic acid. Dispersant 20 Various phosphoric diester compounds were prepared in the same manner as in Referential Example 20, except that the reactants were replaced by those which are shown in Table 3 below.
