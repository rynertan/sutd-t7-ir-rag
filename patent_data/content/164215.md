# Gas fluidised bed terpolymerisation of olefins.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a gas fluidised bed process for the production of copolymers having a density be tween 0.900 and 0.935, which proces comprises copolyme risation of a ethylene, b propylene and or 1 butene, and c alpha olefins comprinsing from 5 to 8 carbon atoms in the gaseous state, in admixture with an inert gas and optionally with hydrogen, in the presence of a catalytic system compris ing a cocatalyst consisting of at least 1 organo metallic com pound of a metal of groups II and III of the Periodic Table of Elements and a special solid catalyst.
