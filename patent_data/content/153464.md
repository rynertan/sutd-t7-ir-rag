# Method of curing expansion molded body of polyolefin.

## Abstract
The subject matter of the invention is a method of curing an expansion molded body of polyolefin prepared by heating the pre expanded polyolefin particles filled in a mold. According to the method of the invention the molded body is cooled in the mold within the extent that the molded body in the mold retains its volume substantially 100 equivalent to the volume of the mold cavity. Then the molded body is removed from the mold, placed into an atmosphere having a temperature 25 to 55 DEG C lower than the melting point of the base polyolefin resin while the volume of the molded body is 70 to 110 relative to the volume of the mold cavity, and held in the atmosphere until its temperature equilibrates with the temperature of the atmosphere.
