# Method for sorting radioactive waste.

## Abstract
Method for examining dry material, components of which may have a low level of radioactivity, to sort the radioactive components from the non radioactive components. It comprises the steps of placing of material in a first detection station where radiation above a predetermined level can be detected and then removing the components from which the radiation is emanating. The remainder of the material is then conveyed to a second detection station where means are provided for detecting radiation above a second predetermined level. The components of the material which is detected as having radiation which is a level above the second level is then removed. The remaining components are then placed in a container and the container is delivered to a third radiation detection station where radiation emanating from the container which is above a predetermined level is detected. If no radiation is detected as emanating from the container then the container and the material therein are disposed of as non radioactive.
