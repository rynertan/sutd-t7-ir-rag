## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for improving the accuracy obtained from a global positioning system which comprises a plurality of satellites each broadcasting two or more navigational signals. The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System GPS is a satellite based radio navigation system intended to provide highly accurate three dimensional position and precise time on a continuous global basis. When the system becomes fully operational in late 1988, it will consist of 18 satellites in six orbital planes, and three active spares. Each satellite will continuously transmit navigation signals at two carrier frequencies, L1 1575.42 MHz and L2 1227.6 MHz consisting of the P code ranging signal a 10.23 MBPS pseudonoise code , the C A code ranging signal a 1.023 MBPS pseudonoise code , and 50 BPS data providing satellite ephemeris and clock bias information. Unbalanced Quadri Phase Shift Keying UQPSK modulation is utilized with the data bits added to the ranging codes, the C A code signal lagging the P code signal by 90 and the C A code signal power nominally exceeding the P code signal power by 3dB. Navigation using GPS is accomplished by passive triangulation. The GPS user equipment measures the Pseudo Range to four satellites, computes the position of the four satellites using the received ephemeris data and processes the Pseudo Range measurements and satellite positions to estimate three dimensional user position and precise time. GPS receiver signal processing can be partitioned into three parts RF signal processing, estimation of In phase I and Quadrature phase Q signals and subsequent processing of these I and Q signals to implement code and carrier tracking, data demodulation, SNR estimation, sequential detection, and lock detection functions. Traditionally, all three parts are implemented using analog signal processing techniques. A paper briefly reviewing analog RF signal processing implementation which describes three digital signal processing DSP techniques for implementing the I Q generation function, and describes DSP algorithms for implementing the subsequent procesing functions may be found in the NTC 83 A Delta Range DR measurement is derived from the difference in carrier phase over a fixed time interval. Position can be estimated using Delta Ranges through the change in the satellite position over the observation interval. A similar disclosure is contained in the same conference papers in an article entitled GPS INS integration for range instrumentation by J. L. Arnold and R. W. Blank at pages 226 to 238. It is an object of the present invention to reduce the amount of time required to obtain an accurate location of a receiver utilizing a global positioning system. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for enhancing the information received from a global positioning system which includes a plurality of satellites each transmitting at least two carrier frequency signals, including the steps a identifying a plurality of selected satellites b setting information storage units for accumulated Delta Range measurement by adding the above mentioned Delta Range information for each selected satellite to zero c tracking the selected satellites d receiving said carrier frequency signals from said selected satellites and e measuring the phase of said carrier frequency signals from said selected satellites characterised by the following steps According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided apparatus for enhancing the information received from a global positioning system which includes a plurality of satellites each transmitting at least two carrier frequency signals, having means 14 for selecting a plurality of satellites whose transmitted signals are to be received means 18 for storing means 16 for setting each means for storing to zero means 16 for receiving said carrier frequency signals from said selected satellites means 16 for measuring the phase of said carrier frequency signals received from said selected satellites and means 16 for measuring changes in phases of said carrier frequency signals over a predetermined time interval characterised by Thus, the invention is based on the realisation that accumulation of all Delta Range measurements for each new time interval and all old time intervals eliminates many of the errors created when measuring a Delta Range for an individual time period. By adding information from previous Delta Range measurements to the newest Delta Range measurement, it is possible to determine the position of the receiver to a given accuracy in a much faster time frame. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, wherein A GPS receiver makes a measurement of Pseudo Range PR , the difference between the time of reception and time of transmission of the GPS signal, from tracking the Pseudo Random Noise PRN codes modulated on the GPS carrier. The Delta Range DR measurement is derived from the difference in carrier phase over a fixed time interval, generally one second, measured using a Phase Locked Loop PLL . The Pseudo Ranges and Delta Ranges are related to user position error, LOS is an abbreviation for Line Of Sight Vector which incorporates the elevation angle and azimuth angle of a satellite. For static point positioning the user s velocity is known to be zero and so equation 1.5 simplifies to The LOS vector to a GPS satellite does not change significantly over a one second interval, so to improve the geometry of the navigation solution it is advantageous to accumulate Delta Ranges even longer time intervals to form a new measurement variable, Accumulated Delta Ranges ADR . Since the Delta Ranges are formed from the difference between two phase measurements from the carrier tracking phase locked loops, it is important to note that Accumulating Delta Ranges to form a new measurement do not increase the measurement error. Note, that the term n Defining the phase measurement errors to be Since adjacent Delta Range measurements share a common phase measurement, the phase errors associated with these common measurements cancel out in the Accumulated Delta Range measurement. The Delta Ranges have zero mean error but are correlated between adjacent time intervals. Alternatively, the Accumulated Delta Ranges share a common bias error, the initial carrier phase error, but apart from this bias all samples are uncorrelated. The measurement equation for the Accumulated Delta Range measurement becomes As time increases, the satellite geometry for estimating position error improves. Because of the independence between each measurement, it is possible to process an Accumulated Delta Range every second from each satellite tracked. This allows position to be determined to far greater accuracy than by processing Pseudo Range Measurements as in the prior art. As shown in equation 1.10 the Accumulated Delta Range measurements, generated every second, are independent of each other and each have the same measurement noise as the one second Delta Range Measurements. Four Accumulated Delta Ranges from four satellites being tracked are generated every second and can be processed optimally using a Kalman filter to estimate user position and satellite errors. As is well known, a Kalman filter is a device which receives inputs from two or more variables and processes those variables to produce an output which in a function of the input variables. For example, if pressure and temperature were known inputs, it would be possible to feed this information into a Kalman filter to produce an output representing altitude. A similar process is used here. Wherein the Accumulated Delta Range Measurements from the four satellites are applied to a Kalman filter which produces an output representing the position of the receiving station. The most significant error sources are the satellite ephemeris errors and the satellite clock error. These errors can be modeled by including four additional states per satellite in addition to the four user position and clock frequency offset states, as shown in Table 1. The observation equation now becomes The clock errors are all lumped together in one clock offset term per satellite which estimates the change in the relative user and satellite clock error over the accumulation time interval. This term can also be used to include noise terms to model the range errors introduced by atmospheric effects. The relative clock offset, B is propagated using the estimate of the users clock frequency offset every second. The measurement equation can be written in vector format, as shown for the second satellite tracked. Processing the Accumulated Delta Ranges using this Kalman filter gives position to significantly greater accuracy than that normally achievable by GPS, even for P code users. After tracking for two hours at lower latitudes the Root Sum Square RSS position error drops to around 1.0 m RSS and continues to improve gradually, reaching about 0.3 m RSS after about seven hours. At higher latitudes the position accuracy degrades slightly due to the different satellite geometry, but approximately 1 m RSS is achievable in around five hours. Referring now to the drawing, Fig. 1 shows a receiver 10 which receives transmitted navigational signals from the satellites that comprise the global positioning system via an antenna 12. The transmitted signals are applied to a satellite select circuit 14 which selects the most desirable satellites to be tracked by the global positioning system receiver 16. Once each satellite has been selected, the storage units 18 for each selected satellite are set to zero or cleared of any stored information contained therein. The global positioning receiver then tracks the particular satellites selected and receives the carrier frequency signals from each. After measuring the phase of each of the received carrier signals, the change of phase in the carrier signals is stored within the information storage units 18. In the preferred embodiment, this information is stored over a one second time interval. The Delta Range measurements are accumulated within the storage units 18 so that the first Delta Range determined by the first one second interval is accumulated with the Delta Range information from the second time interval and so on. The outputs of the storage units 18 are applied to a Kalman filter 20 and back to the input of storage units 18 to create Accumulated Delta Range information. At each time interval, the step of reapplying the output of the storage unit 18 to its input is repeated so there is an accumulation of the Delta Range information. These steps are repeated as often as necessary until the position information at the output 22 of the Kalman filter represents the accuracy desired. It will be understood that the present invention may be practiced through the utilization of software or hardware hardware being represented by the block diagram of Fig. 1.
