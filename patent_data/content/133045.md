# Cassette tape recording and or reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a cassette tape recording and or reproducing apparatus having a tape drive with a rotatable idler 8 which is bodily shiftable for changing the operating mode, a mode changing mechanism has first and second mode selecting slide members 24,25 mounted on a chassis 21 for indepen dent movements along parallel paths between operative and inoperative positions, a pivot arm 42 carrying the idler 8 and being swingable in opposite directions, for example, for establishing fast forward and rewind modes, respectively, a coupling member 37 straddling the slide members 24,25 and being engageable with the pivot arm 42 and with actuat ing members 51a,51b which are provided on the slide mem bers 24,25 , respectively, and which engage the coupling member 37 at respective locations thereon spaced apart in a direction transverse to the paths of movement of the slide members 24,25 , and a spring 38 acting on the coupling member 37 along a line of force which is intermediate bet ween the locations where the actuating members 51a,51b engage the coupling member 37 and in a direction for caus ing the coupling member 37 simultaneously to move the slide members 24,25 to their inoperative positions. The movement of a selected one of the slide members 24,25 to its operative position turns the coupling member about the actuating member 51a,51b on the other slide member 24,25 and thereby affects swinging of the pivot arm 42 in one direction or the other for establishing a corresponding mode.
