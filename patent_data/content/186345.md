# HORIZONTALLY LAYERED MOMOM NOTCH TUNNEL DEVICE

## Abstract
MOMOM structural geometry and fabrication techniques are disclosed. A first oxidizable metal strip 3 and a second coplanar nonoxidizable metal strip 6 are deposited on an insulating substrate 2 . An insulating layer 12 is deposited on the metal strips, followed by a deposition of a third non oxidizable metal layer. A generally vertical notch 14 is cut through the layers to the substrate providing left and right sections 15, 16 of the third metal layer, left and right sections 19, 20 of the insulating layer, and the first and second metal layers with facing edges 23, 24 spaced by the notch therebetween. An oxidized tip 25 is formed at the facing edge of the first metal layer. A fourth metal layer 26 is ballistically deposited over the oxidized tip and the left section of the third metal layer, using the notch edge of the right section of the third metal layer as a shadow mask, followed by oxidization of the fourth metal layer. A fifth horizontal metal layer 30 is ballistically deposited by a vertically columnated beam along the substrate across the bottom 28 of the notch between the oxidation layer on the fourth metal layer and the facing edge 24 of the second metal layer. The M O M O M structure is provided by the first metal layer 3 the oxidized tip 25 the fourth metal layer 26 at a generally vertical portion 39 the oxidation layer 29 on the fourth metal layer at a generally vertical portion 41 the fifth metal layer 30 and the second metal layer 6 .
