# Magnetic separator.

## Abstract
A magnetic filter including a tubular case 1 which has a filter region 10 divided along a flow passage 7 into two smaller dimensioned spaces 11, 12 in each of which a filter element of magnetic material is located. A magnetic means 26 is also provided in one of the two spaces. In the smaller dimensioned space 11 including the magnetic means 26 , only a portion of the lines of magnetic force produced by an electromagnetic coil 22 connected to the tubular case is allowed to magnetize the filter element disposed in the same space 11 , while the remaining lines pass through the magnetic means 26 , so that the filter element is magnetized to a minor degree. However, the filter element located in the other smaller dimensioned space 12 is magnetized by all the lines of magnetic force, so that the same space has a higher capacity for attracting magnetic particles. Therefore different types of magnetic particles contained in a fluid are attracted by the lowly magnetized filter element and the highly magnetized one, respectively.
