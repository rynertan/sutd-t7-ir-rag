# Filter house and process for simultaneously removing NOx and particulate matter from a gas stream.

## Abstract
A filter house 12 employs a selective catalytic reduction process for removing NOx emissions from a flue gas stream while simultaneously filtering out and collecting entrained particulate matter from the stream. Accordingly, the filter house 12 includes flue gas inlet and outlet passages 18, 30 and a plurality of porous filter bags. The bags are treated with a suitable catalyst to facilitate the selective catalytic reduction process.
