# Piezoelectric ceramic transducer.

## Abstract
An electro acoustical transducer includes a piezoelec tric ceramic plate 11 which has curved surfaces, electrodes 12 formed on both main surfaces of the plate 11 , a frame 15 of an organic high polymer resin for holding the plate 11 , and means for applying an electric signal to the electrodes 12 . Since the piezoelectric ceramic plate 11 has curved surfaces and the holding frame 15 is made of an organic high polymer resin, the transducer is suitable as a loudspeaker or as a microphone having a wide frequency band.
