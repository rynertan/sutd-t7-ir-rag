# Method and apparatus for measuring specific gravity.

## Abstract
For measuring the specific gravity of a fluid, a fixed volume of the fluid is pressurized. The pressure in the chamber is allowed to decay through a fixed restriction between predetermined pressure limits. The time interval of the pressure decay between the pressure limits is measured and converted into the specific gravity of the fluid.
