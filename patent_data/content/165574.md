# Method for production of maleimides.

## Abstract
A method for the production of maleimides, which comprises subjecting maleinamic acids to ring closure im idation in an organic solvent capable of forming an azeo trope with water in the presence of an acid catalyst at a temperature in the range of 120 to 250 C while removing the formed water in the form of an azeotrope with said organic solvent and thereafter purifying the produced maleimides.
