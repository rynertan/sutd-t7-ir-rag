# Well perforating gun.

## Abstract
A perforating gun in which each shaped charge 40 car ried in a charge holder 12 is oriented so that the jet emanating therefrom substantially intersects the axis of the gun. The charges may be vertically spaced by a distance less than their diameter but sufficient for each charge jet to pass unob structed by other jets emanating from the charges immediately above and below, because they are equipped with gun barrels 46 . In one arrangement the charges are in three parallel rows at 120 C spacing, the barrels are stacked intersecting the centre line and the explosive containing part of the charge having a substantially greater diameter, are offset from the centre line.
