# Separation of lymphocytes and monocytes from blood samples.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to means for inhibiting the apparent shift in the buoyant density of and or to restore any loss in the buoyant density of the granulocytic white blood cells in a sample of blood, thereby insuring the quality of the separation of lymphocytes and monocytes from granulo cytes in a blood sample. The invention comprises contacting a blood sample with a hypertonic fluid containing a low molecular weight organic or inorganic ionic substance and or with an isotonic or hypertonic fluid containing a high molecular weight organic substance which may contain organic molecules having a lipophilic substituent in their a structures and or with a culture medium for blood cells. An integral part of the invention is an improved blood separa tion tube utilizing a gel like substance having a specific gravity between 1.060 1.065 g cmÂ³ to significantly enhance the purity of cell separation. while providing acceptable cell yields.
