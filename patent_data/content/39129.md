# Surface coatings, compositions therefor, and methods of preparing them.

## Abstract
Compositions suitable for forming marine anti fouling surface coatings comprise a polymer e.g. maleinised polybutadiene capable of cross linking with amines, a hyd rocarbyl polyisocyanate and a hydrocarbyl tin oxide or sul phide. The composition is preferably in two packs, which are combined on the surface to be coated, one pack containing the polymer and tin oxide or sulphide, and the other the polyisocyanate. A thio carbamate is formed as an intermedi ate which then hydolyses to an amine. A method of coating surfaces and surface coatings so produced are also claimed.
