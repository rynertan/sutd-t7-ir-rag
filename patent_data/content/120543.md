# Tunable receiver input circuit.

## Abstract
The circuit comprises an amplifying three pole circuit 1 which in the emitter circuit is negatively fedback by a resonant network 4 having the characteristic of a series resonant cir cuit 7, 8 . Such an amplifier circuit is very linear because of the negative feedback. In order to prevent unwanted second and third order noise products from being introduced in the mixing stage 6 subsequent to this amplifier circuit, the mix ing circuit is arranged in series with the three pole circuit.
