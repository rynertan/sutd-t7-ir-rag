# Method of correcting erroneous values of samples of an equidistantly sampled signal and device for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
The values of incorrect samples of, for example, a digital audio signal are estimated by means of interpolation. For this purpose an appropriate sampling interval is determined from the number of incorrect samples, in which interval the incorrect samples are situated. Subsequently, a best fitting recursion formula is determined from the values of the samples, a first estimate being taken for the values of the incorrect samples. By means of this recursion formula the value of a sample is expressed as a weighted sum of the values of a number of preceding samples and an error term. By means of the recursion formula thus found the values of the incorrect samples are subsequently estimated, in such a manner that they are best fitting values for the recursion formula. The Application also discloses a device for carrying out the method.
