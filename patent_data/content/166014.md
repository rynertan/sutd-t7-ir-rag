# Catalyst prepared from organomagnesium compound, organic hydroxyl containing compound, reducing halide source and a transition metal organozinc complex.

## Abstract
A catalyst for polymerizing olefins being the product resulting from mixing in an inert hydrocarbon diluent a mixture of A an organomagnesium material, B an organ ic hydroxyl containing material, C a reducing halide source and D the reaction product or complex formed from the admixture of a transition metal compound and an or gano zinc compound, and, without washing, used with an E activator.
