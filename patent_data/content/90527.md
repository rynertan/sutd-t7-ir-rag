## Description
A FLUX COMPOSITION FOR ELECTRO SLAG OVER LAY WELDING OF A CYLINDRICAL VESSEL WITH A STRIP ELECTRODE The present invention relates to a flux composition adaptable for controlling a slag flow in an electro slag over lay welding of a cylindrical vessel by using a strip electrode in down hand position particularly with an outer electro magnetic field. The inner surface of cylindrical vessels used for pressure vessels for atomic power generation and reactors for chemical plant is surfaced with a stainless steel and the like for providing corrosion resistance.The over lay welding has been carried out by various processes but recently, the electro slag over lay welding with a strip electrode in down hand position in which the dilution by base metal is low, has been interested. This process comprises flowing electric current through a molten slag from the strip electrode to generate Joule s heat and melting the electrode and the base metal due to this heat. As the flux compositions applied thereto, a flux having a high content of CaF2 as disclosed inJapanese Patent Publication No. 53 l978 29,657 andJapanese Patent Laid open Specification No. 55 1980 165,294 and a flux having a high content of TiO2 as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNo. 54 1979 9,139 have been known. The electro slag over lay welding process is an excellent one wherein the dilution by a base metal is few but when said process is applied for surfacing a cylindrical circumferential surface, particularly inner surface of the above described pressure vessel, the flowing state of the molten slag and metal varies at the edge portions and the central portion of the cylinder due to the means and place for connecting ground to the cylinder and to the influence of magnetic field generated by a current supplying cable, or the molten metal flow varies in the vicinity of ground and the defects of under cutting and slag inclusion are apt to be caused and particularly when a broad strip electrode is used for improving the surfacing efficiency, the electric current becomes large and therefore the above described tendency becomes noticeable and therefore, even if the conditions under which the good bead can be experimentally obtained by means of a broad electrode, are adopted as such, such conditions often cannot be applied as the satisfactory electro slag over lay welding process in practice. Furthermore, these cylindrical bodies are made by bend working a steel sheet, so that it is impossible in view of the working precision to obtain a true cylinder and when this distorted cylinder is subjected to the over lay welding while being rotated on a turning roller, the position where a strip electrode for the electro slag over lay welding is set, influences upon the welding, so that a careful consideration should be paid with respect to the variation of the position. Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNo. 55 1980 136,566 U.S.Patent 4,309,587 has disclosed that an outer electro magnetic field is applied to a welding current to generate Lorentz s force, whereby the flow of the molten slag is controlled as shown inFig. 2. If the flow of the molten slag and metal is controlled with an outer electro magnetic field as shown in the above U.S. Patent 4,309,587, the variation of the flow due to the external factor is effectively restrained and the excellent surfaced bead having no under cutting nor slag inclusion can be easily obtained even by using a broad strip electrode. An object of the present invention is to provide flux compositions suitable for magnetic stirring the molten slag and metal with an outer electro magnetic field for preventing the formation of under cutting and slag inclusion when an inner surface of pressure vessels for nuclear power station and chemical plant is surfaced with a stainless steel in electro slag over lay welding with a strip electrode in down hand position. For attaining this object, the following matters are essential. 1 In order to effect the stable electro slag over lay welding wherein the arc is scarcely formed, the electro conductivity of the slag is high. 2 The slag has the moderate viscosity when the viscosity is too low, the control of the flow of the molten slag is difficult and when the viscosity is too high, the slag does not flow. 3 Harmful SiF4 gas is not formed. It has been found that the above described essential matter 1 can be attained by adding 50 60 by weight of CaF2, the above described essential matter 2 can be attained by adding 10 20 by weight of SiO2 in a ratio of SiO2 CaF2 of at least 0.20 and the above described essential matter 3 can be attained by adding CaO so that a ratio of CaO SiO2 is at least 0.5. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view for illustrating an embodiment where electro slag over lay welding is carried out on a circumferential surface of a cylinder with a strip electrode Fig. 2 is a perspective view for illustrating the manner for controlling the flow of the molten pool with an outer electro magnetic field Fig. 3 is a graph showing the fluency of theSiO2 content relative to the CaF2 content upon the welding behavior in the electro slag over lay welding and Fig. 4 is a graph showing the influence of the CaO content upon prevention of the stimulant smell when welding. The inventors have made studies with respect to the influence of the flux composition upon the control of the flow when the electro slag over lay welding process wherein the flow of the molten slag and metal is controlled with the outer electro magnetic field, is applied to a cylinder along the circumferential surface thereof and the following knowledge has been obtained. Firstly, it has been found that when the flux having a high content of CaF2 and a low content of SiO2 as described on Japanese Patent Publication No. 53 1978 29,657 is used, the viscosity of the slag is low and it is difficult to control the flow of the molten slag and metal with the outer electro magnetic field and the flux disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNo. 55 1980 165,294, is small in the amount of CaF2, so that undesirable arc is apt to be caused in the over lay welding of the inner surface of a cylinder through the electro slag over lay welding process and the range of the permissible welding condition is narrow and the viscosity is too high, so that the fluidity of the molten slag is low and the control of the flow with the outer electro magnetic field becomes difficult. That is, by using the fused flux having a composition of 52 by weight of CaF2, 7 by weight ofSiO2, 33 by weight of At203, 5 by weight of MnO and 3 by weight of ZrO2, which is similar to the composition of Example 3 of Japanese Patent Publication No. 53 1978 29,657 and the fused flux having a composition of 45 by weight of CaF2, 15 by weight of SiO2, 15 by weight of CaO, 20 by weight of At203 and 5 by weight of Cur203, which is similar to the composition ofExample in Japanese Patent Laid open SpecificationNo. 55 1980 165,294, a test of the electro slag over lay welding process was carried out on the inner surface of a cylinder having an inner diameter of 2 m under the following condition. As shown in Fig. 1, a cylinder 1 was rotated as shown by an arrow a by using a strip electrode ofSUS 309L having a width of 0.4x150 mm as a welding electrode under welding conditions of a current of 2,500 A, a voltage of 28 V and such a peripheral speed that the welding speed is 15 cm min and the controlling outer electro magnetic field was applied by arranging a pair of coils 3 and 3 wound around iron cores in 400 turns respectively behind a strip electrode 2, that is at the opposite side to a molten pool 4 at both sides of the strip electrode 2 and flowing a current of 1 10 A to each coil as shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 1, a numeral 5 is rolls for feeding the electrode, a numeral 6 is a flux, a numeral 7 is a slag, a numeral 8 is a surfaced metal, and inFig. 2, a numeral ss shows the direction of the controlled flow in a molten pool 4 of the molten slag 4A and the molten metal 4B. As the result, in the former flux, the molten slag reacts too sensitively to enable the control and the overlapped portion of the bead is not uniform and under cuttings are formed. In the case of using the latter flux, when the position of the strip electrode 2 shown in Fig. 1 is more than 15 mm in a distant size 2 from a downward vertical radius line y of the cylinder 1, an arc is formed, while when said position is less than 5 mm, the defects of slag inclusion and lack of fusion are caused and the range of the moderate condition is narrow and when the working precision of the cylinder is taken into consideration, there is problem in practice and even if the distance Q of the electrode position is kept in the range of 5 15 mm, the flow control with the outer electro magnetic field becomes very insensitive because of high viscosity of the molten slag and the variation of the slag flow due to the unstability of the ground position and the voltage supply cannot be satisfactorily controlled. The inventors have prepared a variety of fluxes within a flux composition range having a high content of CaF2 and having stable current flowing and low formation of arc and made studies with respect to these fluxes and found that when a moderate amount ofSiO2 is added wthin the range of 50 60 by weight, the flow of the molten slag and metal can be advantageously and properly controlled with the outer electro magnetic field. That is, as shown in Fig. 3, it has been found that if a ratio of SiO2 CaF2 is at least 0.20 within the range of 50 60 by weight of CaF2, the flow of the molten slag and metal can be satisfactorily controlled with the outer electro magnetic field. In this experiment, the other components of the flux were 0 25 by weight of CaO and 10 35 by weight of at203. When SiO2 exceeds 20 , the viscosity is excessively high and the flow control becomes difficult.When CaF2 exceeds 60 , even if the ratio of SiO2 CaF2 is at least 0.20, the viscosity excessively lowers and the flow control becomes difficult. SiO2 reacts with CaF2 to generate SiF4 gas as follows when CaF2 is more than 50 . SiO2 CaF2 SiF4 CaOThe resulting SiF4 has stimulant smell and is harmful in view of industrial hygiene but the addition of CaO lowers the activity of SiO2 to decrease the generation of SiF4. Studies have been made with respect to this point and it has been found that as shown in Fig. 4, when the ratio of CaO SiO2 is at least 0.50, there is no stimulant smell and the formation of SiF4 is prevented.But, when CaO exceeds 25 , the separation of the slag becomes difficult, so that CaO should be not more than 25 . At203 is effective in an amount of not less thanlQ by weight in order to obtain the desirable wave form of the bead surface but when the amount exceeds 30 by weight, the bead surface becomes locally concave and the bead appearance is damaged, so that the amount must be within the range of 10 30 by weight. When the yield of Mn and Cr in the surfaced metal must be increased, oxides of Mn and Cr may be added as the flux component and an amount of each of these metals added is 10 by weight and when the total amount exceeds 15 by weight, the separability of the slag is deteriorated and defects are caused at the toe portion of the bead and further the flow control with the outer electro magnetic field becomes difficult, so that even when such oxides are added, the added amount of each component should be less than 10 by weight and the total amount should be less than 15 by weight.
