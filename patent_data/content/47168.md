# Guide apparatus for flexible elements connected to relatively moving units.

## Abstract
A guide for flexible power lines connecting a power supply 6 to a moving device 4 is formed of a plurality of similar tubular duct elements 8 of a transverse rectangular configuration. Each element is mounted in telescoped re lationship to the adjacent elements, and is telescoped over one adjacent element and into the other adjacent element. The telescoped elements are pivotally connected to form a beam support 9, 10 in the linear direction and a curved support between the beam supports. Each element is formed as a cast element of a suitable metal or other material having relatively heavy walls. The side walls include offset planar wall portions 16, 17 interconnected by transverse interior stop walls 18 which are angularly oriented and shaped in accordance with the desired permitted pivotal motion of the adjacent elements. The stop walls and the outer adjacent end edge wall of the adjacent element are similarly shaped with first and second opposed wall portions 27, 22 . The first wall portion 21 of the side walls abutt in the beam position and the second wall portions 22 are spaced by the maximum pivotal movement. The opposite outer end walls are cast with complementing curved surfaces 32, 33 each having a radius which differs only slightly from the opposed surface, to establish a relatively close and constant spacement between the adjacent elements during the pivotal move ment. The end walls may also include pivot stop wall portions.
