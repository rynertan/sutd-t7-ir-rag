# A single acting, multi stage hydraulic ram.

## Abstract
A multi stage hydraulic ram is provided with telescopic ram tubes 10 15 which are terminated by end assemblies 22 and 23 which provide a working surface 26 for the re spective ram tube and a sliding bearing for a next adjacent ram tube. Each of the end assemblies is so mounted on its associated tube and so dimensioned that removal of it from the tube and the ram in an axial direction can be carried out without obstruction from the end assembly of the next adja cent ram of smaller diameter.
