## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention is related to the treatment of liquid solutions containing dilute amounts of carboxylic acids, and more particularly, is related to the substantial extraction of dilute amounts of acetic acid from aqueous streams. The process involves contacting a liquid stream with an extractive insoluble support possessing an effective amount of trihydrocarbyl phosphine oxide or heterocyclic mine sites, preferably dialkylbenzyl nhosdhVne oxide, or N hvdrocarbyl imidazole a ws sites. Descriction of the Prior Art The separation of dilute amounts of organic acids and particularly acetic acid, from various liquids, par ticularly water has been a major industrial concern for over a century and is of particular importance today due to the increased importance of environmental considerations. Additionally, the discharge of such acid waste represents the loss of a valuable chemical resource, as, for example, acetic acid is one of the most important industrial organic acids, with an excess of four billion pounds a year currently being produced and co .swmed worldwide.When the thermodynamic stability of acetic acid is considered, as well as its frequent sroductisn as an end product of many organic degradation reactions, its common occurrence in waste waters becomes both easily understandable and economically significant. A qreat amount of effort has been spent in developing methods for the recovery of carboxylic acids, and particularly acetic acid, from liquid solutions, articu 3 larly very dilute solutions, e.g., containing about 10 to 5.0 wt. 8 acetic acid. In general, the straiqhtforward distillation techniques which are frequently employed for the extraction of larger volumes of acetic acid from liquid, usually aqueous, streams are unsuitable for low concentration solutions, due to the large energy requirements involved, even when employing entraining or azeotroping agents. Consequently, the art has investigated other extraction procedures in an effort to develop an effective and economic method of separating carboxylic acids and water. For example, U.S.Patent 2,395,010 is illustrative of such procedures and describes a process for the extraction of acetic acid from water through the use of amyl acetate as the extraction agent followed by subsequent distillation to recover the acetic acid product. U.S. Patents 3,816,524, 3,980,701, 3,980,702, 3,980,703, 3,980,704, and 3,997,599 are also illustrative of the efforts of prior workers, describing a process whereby carboxylic acids are removed from dilute aaueous solutions through the use of dialkyl allyl phosphine ates, trialkyl phosphine oxides, dialkyl alicyclic amidophosphates, dialkyl sulfoxides and tetralkyl ureas as extraction agents, preferably in combination with organic diluents such as kerosene, carbon tetrachloride, amyl acetate, toluene, ethyl benzyl ketone, dibutyl ether, benzonitrile, 2,2 dichlorc propane, heptane, l nit robutane,triethyl phosphite, l pentanol, ethoxy triethol silanes and l fluoropentane. U.S. Patent 2,275,862 dLSt closes a similar process using higher dialkyl ketone extractants, while U.S. Patent 2,446,231 employs ethyl disulfide as an extractant. U.S. Patent 4,153,809 discloses the separation of diglycolic acid from qlycolic acid by a preferential extraction from an aqueous mixture of the two acids, using a water insoluble trihydrocarbyl phosphine oxide as the extraction agent. The prior art involving the use of heteroccle amines and, particularly no N arbyl imidazole derivatixes Is extractants of dilute amounts of carboxylic acids is negligible U.S. Patent 4,218,568 mentions that formic acid can be withdrawn from a hydrolysis equilibrium by imidazole derivatives, and later separated therefrom,U.S. Patent 4,430,445 discloses the use of imidazolemethylstyrene polymers as ion exchange resins, while an article discussing the preparation and catalytic properties of imidazole ligands bound to polystyrene and its complexes with transition metal ions is disclosed in J. of MolecularCatalysis, 3 1977 78 p. 47 50, Hulsbergen et al. The trialkyl phosphine oxide based methods have substantial flaws for example, when using trioctylphosphine oxide TOPO as an extractive agent with a kerosene solvent it is necessary to add salt in order to prevent ar. emulsion from forming on the interface, and the presence of such a salt is undesirable. Also, the extractive agent is often partially soluble in water and thus additional processing steps are required for separation. An initial processing of the acetic acid overhead is also required to separate it from the organic carrier solvent. For example, some kerosene is distilled with the acetic acid in a TOPO kerosene extractive system. Finally, the solvents used in these processes are usually toxic, and some solvent loss is usually inherent in the process.An excellent discussion of the problems involved can be found in two articles by Ricker et al., Solvent Extraction with Amines forRecovery of Acetic Acid from Dilute Aqueous IndustrialStreams , J. Sear, Proc. Technol., 1 2 p. 23 30 1980 and Solvent Properties of Organic Bases for Extraction ofAcetic Acid from Water , J. SeDar. Proc. Technol., 1 1 p. 36 41 1979 . Therefore, in accordance with the above, a novel process has been developed for the treatment of liquid, particularly aqueous, solutions containing dilute amounts of carboxylic acids, particularly acetic acid, usually involving industrial and or environmentally sensitive processes. The process involves utilizing a variety of extractive insoluble supports, each possessing an effective amount of either trihydrocarbylphosphine oxide or heterocyclic amine sites, thereby enabling the carboxylic acid values to be extracted onto the insoluble support. Upon saturation the extractive support is surprisingly easily regenerated by driving off the acetic acid in a low cost, highly efficient separation operation, followed by recycling the support back to the acid extraction zone for future usage. It is, accordingly, an object of the invention to provide an efficient, economical process for the substantial removal of low concentraticns of carboxylic acids, particularly acetic acid, present in livid solutions. It is another object of the invention to provide an insoluble extractive support which is particularly effective for use in removing dilute amounts of acetic acid from aqueous solutions. It is still another object of the invention to provide an extractive support which can be easily and efficiently regenerated and reused without losing a substantial amount of extractive capacity or without decomposition of the support. SUaLRY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the aforementioned objects, a novel process for the economic treatment of liquid, particularly aqueous, solutions containing dilute amounts of carboxylic acids e.g., solutions containing from about 1 7 10 3 to 5.0 wt. acetic acid, comprtses contacting an insol uble extractive support, preferably a derivitized crosslinked polystyrene resin, possessing an effective amount, i.e., exhibiting Equilibrium Distribution Coefficients ranging from about 0.2 up to as high as about 20, preferably as high as possible, of either trihydrocarbyl phosphine oxide, preferably dialkyl benzylphosphine oxide, most preferably di n octyl benzylphosphine oxide, or heterocyclic amine, preferably imidazole and most preferably N benzyl imidazole sites, with a carboxylic acid containing stream in an acid extraction zone. Upon saturation the extractive support can be regenerated, preferably by contacting with a hot solvent wash, e.g., heated air, in a regeneration zone before being placed back on stream for further acid contacting. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As disclosed below and outlined in Figure 1, a particularly preferred embodiment of the process of the invention has been set forth. However, many other equivalent embodiments are suitable, as will be apparent from the following detailed description. Figure 1 discloses a simplified outline of the preferred embodiment of the process. An exstractive in soluble support has been derivitized with trihydrocarbyl phosphine oxide sites, so that the support exhibits anEquilibrium Distribution Coefficient which ranges from about 0.2 to 20, preferably, of course, as high as possible. Equilibrium Distribution Coefficient has its conventional definition EDC rrunt of acid absorbed bv fresh ssstrt at ewlibrin Amount of acid in solution at equilibriumThe support is preferably an extractive organic resin, which is contacted in an acid extraction zone with a dilute solution of carboxylic acid and substantially extracts the dilute acid values, e.g., about 10 3 to 5.0 wt. present in the liquid stream.The substantially deacidified stream exits the extraction zone and proceeds onwards, while the support upon becoming saturated is taken off stream and reqenerated in a suitable reenera tion zone by any one of a variety of methods, such as contacting with a hot organic solvent, hot nitroqen or air, and eventually put back on stream in an extraction zone for Other in the, preferably continuous process. Also, a hot alcohol or an aqueous basic stream can be used to remove the extracted acid and form an ester e.g,, methyl acetate is produced by contacting the extracted acetic acid on a support with a methanol stream in the presence of an acid catalyst. In the broadest embodiment of the invention, a class of carboxylic acids represented by the formulaRCOOH, where R can be hydrogen, a linear or branched chain alkyl containing from 1 to 100 carbons, or a substituted linear or branched substituted chain alkyl of 1 to 10C carbons, are suitable for extraction. Representative acids which may be recovered by the process are formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, lactic, crotonic, glycolic, trifluoroacetic, pyruvic, methacrylic, maleic, fumar c, cyanoacetic, succinic, diglycolic, and the like.The liquid solution containing the acid or acids to be recovered may additionally include a wide variety of dissolved or suspended substances which do not interfere with the subsequent extraction of the acid onto the extractive support. wether or not other organic coextract with the acid is immaterial to the instant invention. If such coextraction does occur and it is desired to separate the recovered acid upon completion of the process, this can be done in a number of. ways apparent to those skilled in the art. Since it is envisioned that the primary utility of the present process will be as a late state cleanup step before disposal o recycle of an aqueous effluent, coextraction of other organic present will generally be advantageous. Although it is envisioned that the dilute acid values to be removed will generally be extracted from aqueous solutions, in the broadest embodiment liquids which may be deacidified can comprise aromatics, nitriles, esters, alcohols, ketones, ethers and the like, as well as mixtures thereof. Suitable representative substances are toluene, acetonitrile, amyl acetate, methanol, diethylketone, dibutylether and the like. A variety of extractive organic supports are suitable for use in the process, with the most preferred support being a member of a class of organic resins including polystyrene, polybutadiene, polyphenylene, polypropylene, polyethylene and various copolymers thereof.It is most preferred that the resins are crosslinked with any one of a number of crosslinking agents known to those in the art, e.g., divinylbenzene, so as to make the resin insoluble. The organic extractive resins suitable for use can be either macroreticular or microporo s in structure. In the broadest embodiment of the invention any insoluble support which is chemically bonded to the extractive trihydrocarbyl phosphine oxide or heterocyclic amine can be suitable, e.g., activated carbon, alumina, silica and the like. Alumina and silica can be functionalized with a trihydrocarbyl phosphine by the method disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,151,114. The extractive acent anchored to the support can then be oxidized by oxyqen or hydrogen peroxide. An activated carbon can be functionalized with a trialkylphosphine, a triarylphosphine or a mixed arylalkyphosphine by the method disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,325,834. The phosphine can also be oxidized to the corresponding phosphine oxide by air or hydrogen peroxide in the same manner. The extractive resins most preferred for use in the process of the invention can be derivitized in the manner disclosed in the publication1 Phase TransferCatalysis in the Chemical Modification of Polymers, PartIII, Prenaration of unsvmetrical Tertiary PhosohineOxides, T.D. Niguyen, et al., Bulletin De la SocieteChimique de France, 1982, No. 9 10.The most preferred resin is a nolystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer, with the derivitization proceeding as below EMI8.1 Other suitable methods are the alkylation of the Grignard reagent R2P O MgX with the chloromethylated polystyrene or the reaction of the chloromethylated polystyrene with alkali metal salts or disubstituted phosphinites. ow ever any synthesis which can produce members of the above identified class of resins is also adaptable for use in the process of the invention. The aforementioned phosphine oxide, R1R2R3P O, can be attached to the insoluble support through R1, R2 or A3, as is seen below for P1 e.g.EMI8.2 Either R1, R2 and or R3 can comprise an alkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylaryl, aryl, aralkyl or an aracycloalkyl group, each containing from about 1 to 100 carbons, and preferably about 5 to 50 carbons. The total number of carbon atoms present in the R group, in sharp contrast to prior art solution extraction methods where the phosphine oxide moiety is required to be soluble in the organic phase, isn t critical in this system.Some specific trihydrocarbyl phosphine oxide moieties which can be effectively attached to polymer supports are benzyldioctylphosphine oxide, tri n octylphosphine oxide, benzyldimethylphosphine oxide, benzyldibutylphosphine oxide, benzyldiphenylphosphine oxide, dioctylphenylphosphine oxide, dibutylphenylphosphine oxide, tridecylphosphine oxide, triphenyiphosphine oxide, diphenyloctylphosphine oxide, naphthyldioctylphosphine oxide, tritolylphosphine oxide, tricyclohexyiphosphine oxide, cyclooctyldioctylphosphine oxide, cyclooctylphenyloctylphos phine oxide, 2 phenylethyldioctylphosphine oxide, 3chloropropyldioctylphosphine oxide, 3 cyanopropyldioctylphosphine oxide and 2tri luoromethylethyldiocty1phosphine oxide. Benzyldialkylhosphine oxides such as di n octyl benzylphosphine oxide and benzyldibutylphosphine oxide analogues attached to suitable insoluble supports are particularly preferred. Molecules from the class of heterocyclic amines are also suitable for derivitization onto the insoluble supports, particularly imidazole and most particularlyN hydrocarbyl imidazole and its derivatives. The generic formula can be represented asEMI9.1 where R1 and R2 can be hydrogen,alkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, cycloaryl, aryl, araalkyl, or an aracycloalkyl group, each group containing from about 1 100 carbons, and preferably 5 50 carbons. Some representative examples are the most preferred compound, N benzyl imidazole, 2propyl imidazole, N benzyl 2 propyl imidazole, N benzylbenzimidazole, N benzyl 2 octyl imidazole, N benzyl 2amyl imidazole, N butyl 2 ethyl imidazole, N cyclooctyl2 methyl imidazole, N dodecyl 2 octyl imidazole, N phenyl2 octyl imidazole, and N octyl 2 phenyl imidazole. Other heterocyclic amines and their hydrocarbyl derivatives such as pyridine, pyrrole, oxazole, thiazole, pyrazole, 1,2,3 triazole, 1,2,4 triazole, tetrazole, and the like can be derivitized unto a support. The preparation of derivitized imidazole polymers can proceed as outlined below EMI10.1 In this case the non nucleophilic, strongly basic sponge 1 ,8 bis dimethylamino naphthalene takes up the hy7ro chloric acid as it is formed. Referring to Figure 1, a liquid, most ccomonly an aqueous stream containing dilute amounts, e.g., about 10 to 5.0 wt. of carboxylic acid, most preferably acetic acid in amount of about 0.1 to 2.0 wt. , such as that which might exit from a biological waste treatment plant, is introduced via line 2 into an acid extraction zone 4.After being contacted with the acid containing stream the now substantially deacidified stream exits the zone through line 6 and proceeds onwarda, while the disclosed extractive support in extraction zone 4 gradually is saturated, until the acid containing stream is diverted into line 8 and contacted with a fresh catalyst extractive support in a parallel extraction zone 10 while the exhausted, now off stream support in zone 4 is regenerated. It is preferred that in conjunction with such a process there be present a sufficient number of parallel extraction zones each containing activated catalyst supports, with each zone being capable of being switched on and off stream when desired.When a particular extractive support becomes acid saturated the acid bearing stream is switched to a suitable fresh extraction zone while the acid saturated support is taken off stream and regenerated for later use. In such a manner the process can be run continuously, and for industrial zrposes this is so preferred, although batch technicgies can also be effective ly utilized. Referring back to the Figure, the support can be regenerated and the recovered acid removed from the zone through line 12, most preferably by contacting with a hot, e.g., preferably 120 1600C stream 14 of air in the case of acetic acid, although a variety of other organic extractive fluids such as acetonitrile can be used.The regenerating fluid stream is fed from line 14 through regeneration zone 10 and can also be diverted to zone 4 through line 16 when that zone requires regeneration. Although hot air is preferred as the acid removing agent, a variety of other gases including helium, argon, other inert gases, oxygen, nitrogen and the like may be adaptable for use in the process. Other suitable regeneration techniques are washing the resin with a minimum amount of hot water to obtain a concentrated acid solution, distilling the acid from a solvent in which it forms an azeotrope, such as m xylene in the case of acetic acid, the use of an aqueous solution of a weak base, and the use of an alcohol in conjunction with an acid catalyst to form an ester. An additional advantage of the process is that the extractive supports are easily regenerated by simply contacting with a hot fluid stream. Upon completion of the regeneration operation, the reactivated extractive support is suitable for use in an onstream extraction zone in the process, and such a cycle can be repeated indefinitely. From the above discussion it can be seen that the simplified embodiment of the invention provides a novel, economic and extremely efficient method for recovering chemical values from both aqueous and non aqueous streams containing dilute amounts of carboxylic, and particularly acetic acid values. The dilute acid values can be extracted and either converted to concentrated acid at significantly reduced costs or otherwise disposed of, when contrasted with the expensive separation techniques required ed by using prior art solvent extraction methods. kn important benefit of the process is that the recovered acid values are isolated in a concentration of 30 B0 acid with a minimum of effort.Such carboxylic acids are in their own right chemicals of great value, and their recovery, even at low volumes of production, is a valuable additional benefit of the process. The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention in accordance with the principles of this invention but are not construed as limiting the invention in any way except as indicated by the appended claim.

The mixture was heated for 64 hours at 820C. The mixture was cooled and filtered at room temperature. The polymer was then washed with five 100 ml portions of toluene, five 100 ml of acetonitrile, five 100 ml of methanol, five 100 ml of water, and three 100 ml of methanol. The polymer was then dried under.vacuum at 50 CC. Elemental analysis of the polymer indicated 2.088 nitrogen 0.75 mmole . EXAMPLE 1 The functionalized polymer 18.3g was loaded into a column having a 1.5 an i.d, and a 2.1 acetic acid solution in water was run through the column. .i ots were taken from the column in 3 ml portions and t.rated with standardized 0.01N sodium hydroxide. The Dolt er absorbed 3.0 mmoles of acetic acid, or 0.16 amoles per g polymer, and yielded an equilibrium distribution coefficient of 0.48. In all the examples illustrated the distribution coefficient is defined as cuantity of acid absorbed by the dry resin divided by quantity of the acid in the aqueous solution at equilibri,. The column used above was equipped with a jacket in which heated silicon oil could be circulated with a pump and a hot gas such as nitrogen could be run through the polymer from the bottom of the column up to a U tube at the top. A cold trap of dry ice was ased to tra the acetic acid. The column was heated to 1000C with a 10 ml per minute nitrogen flow to expel traces 0.05g of absorbed water. The column was then heated to 1500C to expel the acetic acid. A 0.10N sodium hydroxide determination of acetic acid and a Karl Fischer determination of water content gave 2.8 amoles of acetic acid 93 recovery with a concentration of 308 acetic acid in water. The polymer was then washed with methanol 100 ml , water 100 ml , and, finally, methanol 100 ml . It was dried at 400C under vacuum. EXAMPLE 1 FIRST RECYCLE The trialkylphosphine oxide derivitized polymer from the first cycle 17.lg was again exposed to a 2.0 acetic acid solution in water which was run through the column and collected at the bottom of the column in 3 cc aliquots.

EXAMPLE 19 FIRST RECYCLE The above polymer was recycled and the experiment repeated under identical conditions. A distribution coefficient of 4.0 was obtained. The polymer was filtered and added to lOOg benzonitrile, 3.0g methanol and 0.05g concentrated sulfuric acid. The lower boilers were distilled under 700C to yield methyl acetate 1.2 mmoles, 73 of theoretical and the excess methanol.
