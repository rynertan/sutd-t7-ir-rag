# Method and apparatus for making rings from tube stock.

## Abstract
Methods and apparatus for making rings from tube stock 10 by a part off rolling tool 12, 15 which is advanced radially into the tube stock 10 to form successive rings 45 , e.g. an nular blanks for subsequent roll forming into bearing rings. The tube stock 10 is indexed forward after separation of each ring 45 . Errors in the length of tube stock indexed forward each time are contained by forming a locating groove 47 on the tube stock 10 by means of a grooverolling tool 40 set at an appropriate axial distance from the part off rolling tool 12, 15 and moved radially with it. In the next cycle the groove 47 au tomatically centres the part off tool 12, 15 as the latter begins its advance into the stock 10 , so as to give the correct axial length of the finished ring 45 . The part off tool 12, 15 is stopped before fully penetrating the tube wall, which is then machined. Final separation takes place during this machining or in a subsequent finishing pass by the part off tool 12, 15 .
