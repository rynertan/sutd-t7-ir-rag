# METHOD OF ACCURATE AND RAPID NMR IMAGING OF COMPUTED T1 AND SPIN DENSITY

## Abstract
A method is provided for accurate and rapid NMR imag ing of computed T₁ and M₀ spin density NMR images. The imaging data is acquired using a repetition of a sequence made up of RF and magnetic field gradient pulses. Each repetition of the sequence includes at least one step of reducing the net longitudinal magnetization in a predeter mined region of the sample to zero. The longitudinal mag netization is allowed to at least partially recover prior to exciting nuclear spins in the predetermined region to produce at least one NMR spin echo signal due primarily to the recovered magnetization. The spin echo signal is sam pled in the presence of a magnetic field gradient for encod ing spatial information.
