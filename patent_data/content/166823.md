## Description
DISENGAGING MEANS FOR A MOTOR VEHICLEThe present invention relates to the disengaging means for a motor vehicle which comprises a foot operated clutch and a manually operated gear box.It is known to operate the clutch between the fly wheel of the engine and the gear box in motorcars by means of a foot pedal which is directly connected with the clutch and which is adapted to disengage the clutch discs against the spring action of the clutch springs. It is also known to support such a mechanical system by means of a hydraulic or pneumatic auxiliary device.In motor cars it is important to keep the power consumption as low as possible, with conservation of the performances. This can be achieved i.a. by reducing the stationary number of revolutions.However, owing to a lower number of revolutions the non uniformity of the crank shaft of the engine is increased, whereby unacceptable clattering and rattling noises appear in the gear box and the driving line when the clutch is not disengaged.The present invention tends to give a solution to this problem. For that purpose a structure has been invented in which the clutch of a motor vehicle, with running engine, after the clutch pedal has been treaded and the gear box has been put into its neutral position, mains disengaged when the clutch pedal is released thereafter. IEne oscillations caused by the non uniformity of the engine cannot bi guided then to the driving line, so that the clattering and rattling noises, which are very inconvenient for the passengers, will no longer appear. The European patent application 81201404.1 describes a disengaging gear with the abovementioned aim for a hvdraulically operated clutch. rw appears that for a motor vehicle having a mechanically operated clutch a vacuum control means can be successfully applied for achieving the purpose aimed at, in which the vacuum of the engine is used in petrol engines or the vacuum pump in diesel engines. 52ne vacuum control means may comprise a vacuum cylinder with integral control valve housing, the vacuum csf which is controlled by a control device which is provided between the control valve housing and the gear lever, said vacuum cylinder being coupled to the clutch by means of a pull cable a piston which is reciprocable in the cylinder and about which a spring dish is reciprocable, which is coupled to a clutch pedal by means of a pull cable a resilient member cooperating with the spring dish a tube which forms the end of the vacuum line and which is rigidly connected with the housing, said tube protruding through the control valve housing and at its end having radial apertures and axial apertures, which are covered by a rubber closing plate and which are incorporated in a cover plate having a diameter which is slightly larger with respect to the tube, and a spring loaded valve mounted within the control valve housing around the tube, said valve controlling the vacuum between piston and cylinder.Bowever, the fact that the clutch remains disengaged, as described above, would also imply that then the clutch pedal is still hanging loose, i.e. it does not return, as in the known disengaging means, into its original position, under the influence of the springs in the clutch.However, the driver is used, when he wants to start the vehicle again, to tread the clutch pedal against the said spring action.In order to stimulate this in the device according to the invention the vacuum control device is carried out in such a way that owing to the vacuum force and owing to an additional spring force the clutch pedal yet returns into its original position. These forces are almost equal to the force of the springs in the clutch.In the disengaging means according to the invention the vacuum control system is provided between the clutch and the clutch pedal.The invention will be further elucidated herebelow from the drawing, in which by way of example an embodiment of the means according to the invention is represented. In the drawing the figures 1 4 show diagrams of the disengaging means in the normal driving position, with treaded clutch pedal, with gear lever in neutral position and with released clutch pedal, and figure 5 shows in an enlarged scale the section of the vacuum control means.The disengaging means belongs to a fly wheel 1 of the engine and a clutch housing 2 with therein the clutch comprising a clutch disc 3, a pressure group 4 and clutch springs 5. The pressure group 4 is connected by means of a lever 6 with a pull cable 7 which extends through the rope mantle 8 locked in between the fixed points 9 and 10. She vacuum control means comprises a housing 11 in which a cylinder f3 comprising a piston 13 is mounted. Between the cylinder 12 and zfhe piston 13 a membrane 14 is provided. The piston 13 is formed 71 such a way that it is capable of receiving a spring dish 15. A spiral spring 17 is mounted about the central box like part 16 cEE the spring dish 15. Tfne pull cable 7 is coupled to the cylinder 12 through an aperture in the housing 11 at 18. In the housing 11, moreover, a tube 19 is provided which is inserted into the cylinder 12 through the apertures 3 and 21. The apertures 20 and 21 are provided in the control valve no using 22 which is integrated with the cylinder 12. In the control valve housing 22 a control valve is mounted comprising a valve 23 nd a valve spring 24. The valve 23 which is adapted to close the apertures 21 is slidably mounted onto the tube 19. The tube 19 is provided with radial apertures 25 at the end located in the vacuum rsom of cylinder 12. This is represented more clearly in figure 5.The tube 19 is closed at the end by a cover plate 26 onto which a closing plate 27 is mounted. The cover plate 26 comprises a protruding edge 28 and is provided with axial apertures. The housing 1 is integrated with a cylindrical box 30 provided with a stop edge 31. This stop edge 31 limits the stroke of the piston 13 when the latter is moved to the right in that then the flange 32 of the piston 13 contacts the edge 31. In the figures 1 4 furthermore the clutch pedal is indicated by 33.Said pedal is coupled to the spring dish 15 through a pull cable 34 extending through the ropemantle 35, which is locked in between the fixed points 36 and 37. For that purpose the pull cable 34 at its end is provided with a thickening 38 fixed in the spring dish 15.The gear lever is indicated by 39 and said lever may be in the neutral position N or in a switched position G. A rod 40 is mounted to the gear lever 39 and operates a switch 41 which is incorporated in an electric circuit. This circuit further comprises a solenoid 42 provided about the stem of a valve 43. The valve 43 is adapted to admit either the atmosphere into the tube 19 at A or vacuum of the engine or a pump at V.In the housing 11 furthermore an air supply aperture is provided, indicated by 44.In figures 1 through 4 successively the situations are given which are created when a running motor vehicle is stopped and is started again directly thereafter, so that the engine keeps on running stataLonarily. Figure 1 represents the normal driving situation. The clutch pedal 33 is in position D, i.e. that the clutch is not treaded. The gear lever 39 is in a switched position G. The vacuum room of the cylinder 12 is connected at A through tube 19 with the atmosphere through the apertures 25 which have not been closed by the valve 23, 24 since the clutch springs 5 keep the cylinder fully to the right by means of lever 6 and pull cable 7. If it is desired to stop the vehicle from this position, firstly the clutch 33 is treaded. The situation which is created then is indicated in figure 2. By means of the pull cable 34 which is fixedly connected with the spring dish 15 with its thickened end 38, the spring dish 15, the piston 13, the cylinder 12 and the spring 17 are moved to the left.Therewith also the control valve housing 21 is moved to the left, and valve 23 is shifted to the left along tube 19.The radial apertures 25 are not yet closed now by the valve 23.When the gear lever 39 is put into the neutral position, indicated by character N, the situation which is represented in figure 3 is created. Then by means of the switch 41 the electric circuit is closed, whereby the solenoid 42 is excited.The valve 43 cuts off the supply of atmosphere at A and opens the passage to engine vacuum or vacuum pump at V. Vacuum suction takes place now in the room between cylinder 12 and piston 13. The piston 13 is moved to the right whereby spring 17 is tensioned until the force in the spring 17 is equal to the force in the pull cable 7, which is drawn by the clutch springs 5. In case there is more vacuum suction when this stage is reached, cylinder 12 is moved slightly to the left under the influence of the vacuum force and at the same time piston 13 is moved to the right. Owing to the slight movement to the left of the cylinder 12 the radial apertures 25 are closed now by the valve 23. This is possible in that the aperture 21 is large enough to make the cover plate 26 pass through.The movement to the right of piston 13 is effected by the force equilibrium between the spring force of spring 17 and the pull force in pull cable 7 and the vacuum force in the vacuum room.When the clutch pedal is released the situation as represented in figure 4 is created.Under the influence of the vacuum force piston 13 is moved to the right until flange 32 abuts against stop 31. Owing to this movement the vacuum room becomes smaller, the subatmospheric pressure is reduced and thereby cylinder 12 is moved to the right.This results in that valve 23 is also moved to the right, whereby the radial apertures 25 are cleared. Then there is vacuum suction again in the vacuum room, whereby cylinder 12 is moved to the left and the apertures 25 are closed again. Owing to the action of valve 23 in this way the subatmospheric pressure in the vaccum room is regulated in such a way that the vacuum force remain in equilibrium with the force in pull cable 7. After this stage the spring 17 is released whereby spring dish 15 is moved to the right and the clutch pedal comes into the position D. Now the situation is created which is aimed at in the present invention, viz. that during stationarily running of the engine the clutch remains disengaged when the gear lever is in neutral position and the clutch pedal is not treaded. When driving from this stage the driver treads the clutch pedal again. He feels a counter pressure onto the clutch pedal caused by the spring 17 and the vacuum, in spite of the fact that the clutch itself is disengaged.By treading of the clutch pedal the spring 17 is compressed until the spring force is equal to the vacuum force onto the piston 13.Upon further treading of the clutch pedal piston 13 is moved to the left. The subatmospheric pressure in the vacuum room is increased, owing to which cylinder 12 is moved to the left. The cover plate 26 stops the valve 23 so that this valve does not close the aperture 21 any more. The atmospheric air may enter then into the vacuum room through air supply aperture 44 and the apertures 20 and 21.Thereby the subatmospheric pressure in the vacuum room is reduced, owing to which cylinder 12 is moved to the right until the valve 23 closes the aperture 21 again.Now the subatmospheric pressure in the vacuum room is in equilibrium again with the force in pull cable 7 whereby the clutch remains disengaged. This is the situation of figure 3. When, at this very moment, the gear lever is put into a switching position, the contact is interrupted at 41. The valve 43 then cuts off the vacuum at B and the passage to the atmosphere at A is opened. Ambient air is flowing then through tube 19 and through the axial apertures 29 into the vacuum room. For that purpose the rubber closing plate 27 is released from the cover plate 26 to clear the aperture 29. Then the situation of figure 2 is created again. When the clutch pedal is released now, the situation of figure 1 is created again. From the foregoing it appears thatthe control mechanism 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 17, 28 and 29 always effects an equilibrium between the vacuum force in cylinder 12 and the pull force in pull cable 7.Also alterations in the force distribution as a result of wearing of the clutch are compensated by this control mechanism. This means that alterations in the clutch force appearing in disengaging means as a result of wearing of the clutch holes are automatically adjusted by application of the present invention.
