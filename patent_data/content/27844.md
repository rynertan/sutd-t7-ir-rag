## Description
DESCRIPTION POLY ESTER CARBONATE WITH HIGH GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURE The U.S. Government has a paid up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of contractRFP F33615 78C 5077 awarded by the U.S. Air Force. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to poly estercarbonates and especially to poly ester carbonates with at least a portion of the hydroxyl groups supplied by substituted tricyclic aromatic compounds. Polycarbonates of various bisphenols including some bisphenols blocked in all ortho positions, are known from U.S. Patent 3,879,348 to Serini et al. issued April 22, 1975 and 3,890,266 to Serini et al. issued June 17, 1975 . Polycarbonates of unsubstituted tricyclic bisphenols are described in U.S. Patent 3,393,244 to Broderick et al. issued July 16, 1968 . Poly ester carbonates are a known class of polymers, being described for example in U.S. Patent 3,169,121 to Goldberg Feb. 9, 1965 , U. S. Patent 4,156,069 of Prevorsek et al. issued May 22, 1979 and three articles by Kolesnikov et al. published inVysokomol. Soyed. as, respectively, A9 No. 5, pp.1012 1015 1967 A9 No. 7, pp. 1520 1524 1967 andA10 No. 1, pp. 145 51 1968 . These polymers are formed by a condensation of a bisphenol such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxylphenyl propane known as bisphenol A , phosgene and a dicarboxylic acid or acid halide such as terephthalic chloride, with the moles of bisphenol approximately equal to the combined moles of phosgene and acid or acid chloride. As described in U.S.Patent 4,156,069 the most desirable combination of properties, including melt processibility, high glass transition temperature, high molecular weight as indicated by specific viscosities in the range of 0.5 to 1 and highIzod impact resistance are achieved when the molar ratio of phosgene to acid chloride is near 1 such as about 0. 81 to about 1.2 1 and where the distribution of polycarbonate and polyester linkages are relatively random, without the presence of large polyester and large polycarbonate blocks. While the poly ester carbonates described inU.S. Patent 4,156,069 have the desired combination of properties for many applications, for certain applications such as cookware, wire coatings, electrical parts and motor housings, dimensional stability above about 1800C as evidenced by glass transition temperature higher than this figure is desirable. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide poly ester carbonates having a glass transition temperature at least about 2000C with the retention, or at least minimal lossof other properties, especially as compared to the poly ester carbonates described in U.S. Patent 4,156,069. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention includes an improved poly ester carbonate consisting essentially of about equimolar amounts of aromatic dihydric alcohol moieties and a combination of carbonate moieties and aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid moieties. In the improvement, at least about 25 mole percent of the aromatic dihydric alcohol moieties are of the formulaEMI2.1 where R is alkylene of 1 6 carbons, 0 , S , CO or a single bond, R is independently at each occurrence H, Br,C1, F, alkyl of 1 6 carbons or phenyl and R is independently at each occurrence Br, C1,F or alkyl of 1 6 carbons and said poly ester carbonate has a glass transition temperature above about 2000C. The present invention also includes such a polyester carbonate molded, extruded or formed by other thermoforming techniques in the form of film, sheet, ribbon, fiber, and shaped articles of various types. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The poly ester carbonates of the present invent ion are formed by the condensation of a bisphenol, phosgene and an acid or acid halide. The relative ratio of phosgene to acid or acid halide is not critical in the present invention, but may vary between about 10 1 and about 1 10, depending on the desired properties. In general, when attempting to achieve high glass transition temperatures, it is preferred that the acid or acid halide be at least approximately equimolar with phosgene such that the ester to carbonate ratio is at least about 0.8 1 and is preferably between about 1 1 and about 1.3 1. Aromatic, monocyclic dicarboxylic acids and acid halides suitable for the present invention include those of the formula II EMI3.1 Where X is hydroxyl, C1 or Br and R is independently at each occurrence H, C1, Br, alkyl of 1 6 carbons, phenyl alkoxy of 1 6 carbons or phenoxy. Suitable cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids and acid halides of the formula III EMI4.1 where X and R are as described above. Other suitable acids and acid halides are of the formula IV EMI4.2 where X and R are as described above and R is CO , alkylene of 1 6 carbons, 0 , S or a single bond and of the formula V EMI4.3 where X and R are as described above. In the cases illustrated by formulas II and III, the acid or acid halide groups are 1,3 meta or 1,4 para , and are preferably 1,4 para .In the case described by formulaIV, the acids or acid halides are meta or para to the linking group R that is the 3,3 , 3,4 and A,4 isomers, and preferably both para as in the 4,4 isomer.In the case described by formula V, the acid or acid halide groups are either 2,6 or 2,7. In all cases, the unsubstituted forms wherein R is hydrogen in all occurrences is preferred. In all cases the acid halides where X is C1 or Br, and especially C1, is preferred.Thus, this monomer is preferably one or more of terephthalic chloride or brornide, isophthalic chloride or bromide, 1,4 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid chloride or bromide, 1,3 cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid chloride or bromide, 3,3 , or 3,4 or 4,4 benzophenone dicarboxylic acid chloride or bromide, 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid chloride or bromide and 2,7 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid chloride or bromide. More preferred in each case are the acid chlorides. Based upon the use of the above preferred acid halide monomers, it will be appreciated that the preferred cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid moieties are terephthaloyl, isophthaloyl, 1,4 cyclohexanedicarboxyl, 1,3 cyclohexanedicarboxyl, 3,3 or 3,4 or 4,4 benzophenone dicarboxyl, 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxyl and 2,7 naphthalene dicarboxyl. The present invention contemplates that at least about 25 of the bisphenol is a tricyclic aromatic bisphenol of the following formula I EMI5.1 The R or linking groups can be alkylene, ether linkages 0 , sulfide linkages S carbonyl linkages CO or a single bond. Preferably, these linkages are alkylene and especially isopropylidene. The R substituents may be hydrogen, or may be for example, bromine, chlorine, alkyl of 1 6 carbons, phenyl, alkoxy of 1 6 carbons or phenoxy. The presence of substituents in the six positions designated by R other than hydrogen, and especially in the four positions on the central phenyl, have relatively little effect upon properties of poly ester carbonate compared to the basic monomer where R is hydrogen in all positions. Mainly because of ease of synthesis, all of the R substituents are preferably hydrogen. It is an important feature of the present invent ion that all four R substituents are not hydrogen.The effect of these substituents is to block or somehow shield the hydroxyls. especially with regard to carbonate linkages, this blocking effect is believed to directly inhibit the flexibility of the polymer and thus to raise glass transition temperature. A carbonate linkage in oligomer or polymer is shown by formula VI with all R substituents omitted EMI6.1 It can be seen that the four R substituents surround the CO3 or carbonate linkage. In a sense, it is believed that these substituents or blocking groups rigidify the polymer at elevated temperatures and thus inhibit melting. As shown by the following examples, not all ortho, ortho blocked bisphenols are suitable. In particular, blocked bicyclic bisphenols such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 2,6 dimethylphenyl propane rigidify the polymer to an excessive extent at low temperatures.This effect has not been observed with blocked tricyclic bisphenols, as are used herein. The result is that, even though the glass transition temperature is raised by using blocked bicyclic bisphenols, other desirable properties of the poly ester carbonate such as ductility, are lost. Additionally, the use of tricyclic aromatic bisphenols by itself does not achieve the desirable properties where at least some of the sub tituents on a position ortho to the hydroxyl group are hydrogen. The key properties of the polymer that must be substantially retained compared to the polymers of U.S. Patent 4,156,069 are ductility and toughness, as indicated by high ultimate and yield elongations according to ASTM D638, high energy to break. The key properties that must improve are high temperature dimensional stability as evidenced by a glass transition temperature at least about 2000C. and resistance to acid and base hydrolysis. It will be appreciated that a polymer of this type normally has dimensional stability up to within 10 200C of its glass transition temperature, but that the temperature at which dimensional stability is lost Way not be measurable with great precision.Accordingly, the characteristic of dimensional stability is hest delineated by the more precise glass transition temperature value with the understanding that the advantageous properties of the polymer actually exist only up to a temperature 10 200C below the glass transition temperature. The method by which the bisphenol is condensed with the phosgene and the acid or acid halide is also not critical to the present invention. A solution method may be used in which all components together or various proportions of them at various times are dissolved in an organic solvent, and especially a chloroaliphatic solvent such as dichloromethane, in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of an organic base such as pyridine. Such methods are described for poly ester carbonates prepared from bisphenol A in U.S. Patent 4,156,069 and in copending applications 6,947 of Baker et al. filed January 25, 1979 and 6,819 of Cooke et al. filed January 26, 1979, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention is not, however, limited to polymers prepared by this particular process, but also includes the condensation products of the above monomers in other solution systems and by interfacial techniques.Example 1 herein employs such interfacial processes as are described more fully in copending application 29,422 ofSegal et al. filed April 12, 1979 . A preferred method of producing the subject poly ester carbonates is a hybrid of the solution and interfacial techniques illustrated in Example 3. In that method the aromatic dihydric alcohol, or at least that portion of it which is of above Formula I, is reacted with aromatic or cycloaliphatic acid or preferably acid halide in an organic solvent with an organic base present in at least about stoichiometric amounts. A polyester soluble in the organic solvent is thereby formed. As illustrated by Example 7, the initial polyester may be formed from the acid chloride and a mixture of at least one bisphenol of Formula I e.g. o,o,o ,o tetramethyIdicumylbisphenol or TMDCBi and at least one other bisphenol e.g. bisphenol A in a proportion that assures that the polyester oligomer will be soluble in the organic solvent. Preferably after acidification and water washing, this organic phase is then mixed with a basic aqueous phase such as aqueous sodium hydroxide and phosgene admitted to link the polyester oligomers with carbonate linkages. Additional amounts of either or both bisphenols may be added with the phosgene or during the subsequent interfacial polymerization, as in Example 7. After polymerization is complete, stirring is stopped clean phase separation occurs and the organic layer can be washed with water and acidified with an organic acid until a clean solution of the polymer in the organic solvent is obtained. The polymer can then be precipitated from the organic phase by adding the organic phase to another solvent such as an alcohol or ketone. The polymer may be redissolved, washed again and reprecipitated, all as exemplified by Example 3. The substituted tricyclic aromatic bisphenols used in the present invention are, in general, known materials. Methods of synthesizing these monomers are either known or would be readily apparent from published literature such as U .S. Patent 3,393,244 to Broderick et al. issued July 16, 1968 which describes unsubstituted tricyclic aromatic bisphenols. U.S. Patent 3,879,348 describes some such bisphenols at columns 3 6 and inExamples 7 14. The following represent typical synthetic routes for different R linkage groups. Where R is to be alkylene, it is desirable to start with the central aromatic ring having two R substituents, each with an active end group Y and to condense this material with two moles of a substituted phenol having an active end group Z para to the hydroxyl. This reaction is shown by equation VII EMI9.1 39 Formula I 2 YZReactive end groups Y and Z are chosen in a manner such that Y will react only with Z and not with the hydroxyl or with the R or R substituents on the substituted phenol. Similarly the Z group is chosen so that it will react with the Y group and not with the R substituent on the other monocyclic starting material. It should be appreciated that Z may be hydrogen if Y can combine with hydrogen as a good leaving group. An example of this condensation is the following reaction VIII EMI9.2 The first starting material may be produced by the oxidation with excess O2 of para diisopropylbenzene. An alternative method of synthesizing at least some of the tricyclic aromatic bisphenols is to react a monocyclic starting material having unsaturated side group materials with aromatic materials which can add across the unsaturated bond. In producing the present polymers, materials other than the bisphenols and the dibasic acids may become incorporated into the chain. For example, para t butyl phenol and other conventional chain length regulators may be used to control the polymer length, with increasing amounts of this additive usually resulting in lowered specific viscosities, other conditions being equal. Thus, if a 2 1 1 molar ratio TMDCB terephthaloyl carbonate polymer is prepared, the use of about 0.5 para t butyl phenol by moles of TMDCB will result in a specific viscosity of about 2 3 dL g, using 1.0 para t butyl phenol will lower the specific viscosity to 1 2 dL g, while using 1.5 para t butyl phenol will lower the specific viscosity to 0.5 1 dL g.Using a combination solution interfacial method as inExample 3, for the same 2 1 1 TMDCB terephthaloyl carbonate ratio, the effect of different levels of para t butyl phenol is more pronounced. Thus 0.25 p tert butyl phenol produced a specific viscosity over 4 dL g, 0.5 p tert butyl phenol produced a specific viscosity of 2 3 dL g, 0.75 para t butyl phenol produced a specific viscosity of 1 2 dL g and 1.0 para t butyl phenol produce a specific viscosity of 0.3 0.7 dL g. The curves are dependent, however, on particular reactor configuration, conditions and other factors, and thus should be developed by routine experimentation in each case.In general, however, less than 2 para t butyl phenol is effective as a chain growth regular, with additonal material being used after the reaction is complete to cap terminal acid chloride and chloroformate groups. Since additional materials like the t butyl phenol are incorporated into the polymer only in small proportions, the polymer can be thought of a consisting essentially of dihydric alcohol moieties, carbonate moieties, carbonate moieties and aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid moieties. In addition to the compression molding methods described in Example 7 that follows, the present poly ester carbonates can also be compression molded at differing pressures and temperatures above the glass transition temperature, preferably about 80 1000C above the glass transition temperature. Such compression molding methods are similar to those known from compression molding of polycarbonates. Additionally, the present poly ester carbonates can be solution cast in a conventional manner. Furthermore, they can be injection molded at mold temperatures above the glass transition temperature with barrel or screw temperatures above the glass transition temperatures, preferably about 80 1500C above the glass transition temperature in a manner similar to that employed in the injection molding of polycarbonates. The following examples are intended to illustrate preferred modes of the present invention and should not be read to limit the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims that follow. Example 1 Diisopropyl benzene a, diol was prepared by bubbling gaseous oxygen into a vigorously stirred suspension of the diisopropylbenzene 900 g in 40 aqueous sodium hydroxide 1260 g at 1000C for 10 hours.The crude product was filtered, extracted with petroleum ether and then water until neutral. The product was recrystallized from ethanol water to give 294 g of material which was further purified by two recrystallizations from 1,2 dichloroethane. The final yield of highly pure diol was 255 g with mp 142 1440C. The calculated elemental analysis based on the formula C12H1802 is C 74.19, H 9.34 what was found is 74.28, H 9.44. The 60 MHz NMR spectrum CDC13 DMSO D6 showed a singlet at 1.56 aliphatic gem CH3 , a broad singlet at 4.46 OH and a singlet at 7.46 phenyl with an integration ratio of 12 2 4 as required by the proposed structure.Unreacted diisopropyl benzene extracted in the petroleum ether was recycled in subsequent preparations. The TMDCB monomer was prepared by addition of the above purified diol 109 g, 0.56 mole in 10 g portions over two hours to a solution of p toluene sulfonic acid 2.8 g, 0.17 mole in freshly distilled 2,6 dimethyl phenol 686 g, 5.6 moles at 650C. After addition was completed, the solution was stirred at 65 700C for an additional 2 hours. Water was then added to about five times the volume and the catalyst neutralized with aqueous ammonia. The mixture was subjected to steam distillation until the removal of unreacted phenol was complete. The yield of crude solid at this point was 212 g 94 based on diol . The solid was dissolved in chloroform 940 mL and the solution was evaporated to dryness on a rotoevaporator.The solid was recrystallized twice from cyclohexane to give 128 g of pure white crystalline monomer, mp 158 1600C, The calculated elemental analysis of the formula C28H3402 C 83.54, H 8.51 what was found is C 83.77, H 8.46. The 60 MHz NMR spectrum CDC13 DMSO D6 showed a singlet at 1.586 aliphatic gem CH3 , a singlet at 2.166 aromatic CH3 , a broad singlet at 5.566 OH , a singlet at 6.78 6 aromatic protons on phenolic ring and a singlet at 7.086 aromatic protons on phenyl ring . The integration ratio was 12 12 2 4 4 as required by the proposed structure. Comparative Example 2 Polycarbonate of TMDCB Interfacial Polycondensation A slurry of TMDCB monomer 20.13 g, 0.05 mole in a solution comprised of distilled deoxygenated water 250 mL , sodium hydroxide 16 g, 0.4 mole , sodium dithionite 0.1 g and triethylamine 0.7 mL, 0.005 mole was prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere. Dichloromethane 250 mL was added and the mixture stirred at 300 rpm at 20 250C while phosgene was admitted as described before. After the pH of the aqueous phase had reached 10, all solid monomer was dissolved and both phases were clear. Phosgene addition was continued until the pH approached 7. At this time aqueous sodium hydroxide 50 mL, 0.4 mole was added and the polycondensation was allowed to proceed for three hours. The mixture was then diluted with water 150 mL and the dichloromethane 110 mL .The organic phase was separated and worked up by the washing and precipitation methods discussed in Example 1. The yield of dry polymer was 18 g with n sp e 1.93 dl g C 0.5, CH2C12 . The polymer was insoluble in phenol TCE. Elemental analysis was calculated based on formula C29H3203 as C 81.27, 7.53 and found as C 81.14, H 7.55. The 60 MHz NMR spectrum CDC13 showed a singlet at 1.61 6 aliphatic gem CH3 , a singlet at 2.22 6 aromatic CH3 , a singlet at 6.886 aromatic protons ortho to CH3 and a singlet at 7.06 d center aromatic ring protons . The integration ratio was 12 12 4 4 as required by the proposed structure.The Tg of the polymer was 1900C DSC with no indication of melting below 3500C. The polymer was thermally stable up to 2750C with major decomposition occurring above 4000C. Example 3 A slurry of TMDCB monomer in aqueous solution was prepared as indicated above, except that in this case the amount of sodium hydroxide used initially was 6 g 0.15 mole . Dichloromethane 100 mL was added under the same conditions of stirring and temperature followed by a solution of terephthaloyl chloride 5.075 g, 0.025 mole in dichloromethane 150 mL . After five minutes, phosgene gas was admitted under stirring until the pH reached 7 30 minutes . Aqueous sodium hydroxide 20 mL, 0.15 mole was added and phosgenation was continued until the pH again reached 7 45 minutes . At this point additional aqueous sodium hydroxide 60 mL, 0.45 mole was added and polycondensation allowed to proceed for three hours. During this time the viscosity of the mixture became so high that dilution with dichloromethane 100 mL became necessary.The mixture was diluted with water 200 mL and worked up as described in Example 1. The yield of dry copolymer was 23.3 g with nSp C 1.8 dL g C 0.5, CH2C12 . The ratio of TMDCB terephthalate carbonate in the copolymer was 2 1 1 by infrared analysis using pure polycarbonate and pure polyester as standards. Thermogravimetric analysis was 2100C DSC with no evidence of melting below 3750C. The TGA showed that major decomposition of the copolymer started at about 4000C. The properties of molded products of this material are indicated in Example 8. Example 4 Five polyester oligomers were prepared by separately dissolving in dichloromethane about 175 mL total terephthaloyl chloride 5.075 g 0.025 mol and twice that molar amount of either TMDCB or a combination of TMDCB and bisphenol A, and pyridine 0.15 mol . The five oligomers had TMDCB as a molar percentage of total bisphenol of 100 , 90 , 80 70 and 60 in the feed.Analysis of the oligomers produced indicated the same molar TMDCB to bisphenol A ratio as in the feed except for the last oligomer where the percentage of TMDCB was 65 in the oligomer versus 60 in the feed. The fifth polymer was not further reacted because it was only partially soluble in dichloromethane. Accordingly, the procedure of Example 7, below, would be used if it were desired for more than 30 of the bisphenol to be bisphenol A and less than 70 of the bisphenol to be TMDCB. The four polyester oligomers having 100 70 TMDCB were converted to poly ester carbonates by adding each in dichloromethane solution to deoxygenated water 250 mL , and adding sodium hydroxide 8 g, 0.2 mol and triethylamine 0.35 mL, 0.0025 mol . The mixture formed an emulsion when stirred at 3000 rev min in a 1 L glass flask. Phosgene gas was admitted over a period of about 45 minutes until the pH of the aqueous phase was 8.After 15 minutes of phosgene addition 0.057 g 0.75 mol p tert butyl phenol was added as a chain growth regulator. with the pH about 8, 0.05 0.1 mol of sodium hydroxide was added to return the pH to about 12 and stirring was resumed for about 3 hours to complete condensation. 0.225g of p tert butyl phenol 3 mol of the total bisphenol was added for end capping. After at least 20 minutes the stirrer was stopped, and for the 100 TMDCB case, immediate phase separation occurred. The polymer phase was then washed successively with water until the pH was 8 and the washings gave a negative response to chloride ion with aqueous silver nitrate. The polymer phase was acidified with dilute acetic acid, and washing was continued until the pH was 6 7. Polymer was isolated by precipitation into 2 propanol followed by vacuum drying at 1200C. The polymer was then redissolved in dichloromethane 5 to 10 solution , and the resultant clear solution was washed several times with water. The final polymer was obtained by re precipitation in 2 propanol. For the 80 TMDCB case, after 20 minutes the reaction mixture was diluted with 200 mL dichloromethane and was worked up as described above. The yield of final polymer was 21 g with nSp C 1.10 dL g C 0.5,CH2C12 . The Tg was 2080C and the TGA showed major decomposition in a single step above 4000C. The ratio of total bisphenols to terephthalate was 2 1 by IR spectroscopy. The ratio of TMDCB to BPA was estimated by nmr spectroscopy as 4 1 . Example 5 A solution of pure TMDCB 20.13 g, 0.05 mole was prepared in a mixture of distilled dichloromethane 100 mL and anhydrous pyridine 12.07 mL, 0.15 mole under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this solution pure terephthaloyl chloride 5.075 g, 0.025 mole dissolved in distilled dichloromethane 75 mL was added rapidly at 25eC with good stirring. After two hours at 250C the homogeneous solution was washed twice with 200 mL of 5 aqueous HC1 followed by water until neutral. The clear water white solution was then placed in a reaction flask containing a solution of distilled deoxygenated water 250 mL , sodium hydroxide 8 g, 0.2 mole and triethyl amine 0.35 mL, 0.0025 mole . The mixture readily formed an emulsion upon stirring at 300 rpm. Phosgene gas was then added until the pH of the aqueous phase was 8 45 min. .At this point aqueous sodium hydroxide 0.05 mole, 25 mL was added to return the pH to 12 and the polycondensation stage was allowed to proceed with stirring for an additional 3 hours. The polymer phase was then washed successively with water until the pH was 8 and the washings gave a negative response to chloride ion with aqueous silver nitrate. The polymer phase was acidified with dilute acetic acid, and washing was continued until the pH was 6 7. Polymer was isolated by precipitation into 2 propanol followed by vacuum drying at 1200C, The polymer was then redissolved in dichloromethane 5 to 10 solution , and the resultant clear solution was washed several times with water. The final polymer was obtained by re precipitation in 2 propanol.The yield of dry polymer was 21 g with n sp C 4.06 dL g C 0.5, CH2Cl2 . The Tg was 214 C. TGA showed decomposition in a single step above 4000C. The ratio ofTMDCB to terephthalate in the final polymer was 2 1 as determined by IR spectroscopy. The material gave a transparent molding at 3200C. Viscosity measurements were made on polymer preared from the 100 TMDCB oligomer and from the 90 , 80 and 70 oligomers in a like manner. Their respective specific viscosities were 1.10, 1.40, 1.10 and 0.81. Example 6 A slurry of purified TMDCB monomer 92.6g, 0.23 mole in a solution containing distilled deoxygenated water 1150 mL , sodium hydroxide 27.6 g, 0.69 mole , sodium dithionite 0.46 g and triethylamine 3.2 mL, 0.23 mole was prepared in a 5 L flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. Distilled dichloromethane 460 mL was added and the mixture was stirred at 300 rev min at 25 C. A filtered solution of purified terephthaloyl chloride 23.3 g, 0.115 mole in dichloromethane 460 mL was then added rapidly to the flask. After ten minutes, a solution of p t butyl phenol 0.52 g, 1.5 mole on TMDCB in dichloromethane 230 mL was added followed by phosgene gas. The phosgene was added until the pH of the aqueous phase reached 7 60 min .Additional sodium hydroxide was then added as a 50 aqueous solution 24 g NaOH and phosgenation continued until the pH dropped to 8. At this point, the final addition of sodium hydroxide was made 54 g and the polycondensation was allowed to proceed for 3.5 hours at 250C under continuous stirring. The polymer phase was worked up by successive water washing, although the presence of a stable water polymer solution emulsion precluded an effective washing. The polymer phase was then acidified with aqueous acetic acid and washing was continued and the polymer was precipitated in isopropanol and dried. Example 7 TMDCB 50 g, 0.124 mole and bisphenol A 12.1 g, 0.053 mole were dissolved in a mixture of distilled dichloromethane 354 mL and anhydrous pyridine 49.9 mL, 0.62 mole under nitrogen. A solution of terephthaloyl chloride 21 g, 0.1035 mole in dichloromethane 295 mL was then added rapidly at 250C with stirring. The homogeneous solution was washed as in Example 5. The composition of the oligomer in terms of relative mole bisphenols was at this point 70 mole TMDCB, 30 mole BPA. The above oligomer solution was stirred at 300 rpm with a solution comprised of deoxygenation distilled water 1033 mL , sodium hydroxide 33.1 g, 0.83 mole , triethylamine 1.48 mL, 0.0103 mole and bisphenol A 6.85 g, 0.03 mole . After 15 minutes of phosgene addition, a solution of p t butyl phenol 0.233 g, 0.75 mole in dichloromethane 5 mL was added. Phosgenation was continued for 60 minutes at which time the 2H had reached 6. Aqueous sodium hydroxide 16 g, 0.4 mole in 50 mL water was added, and the polycondensation was allowed to proceed for an additional four hours. At this point, p t butyl phenol 0.62 g, 2 mol in dichloromethane 10 mL was added. After 20 minutes the reaction mixture was worked up as described above. The yield of final polymer was 78 g with TI 0.99 dL g C 0.5, CH2Cl2 . sp The Tg was 2000C and the TGA showed major decomposition in a single step above 4000C. The ratio of total bisphenols to terephthalate was 2.05 1 by IR spectroscopy.The mole fraction of TMDCB to total bisphenols was estimated by NMR spectroscopy as 0.6. In a similar manner, copolymers having 50 and 60 mole BPA were prepared. In both cases, the ratio of total bisphenols to terephthalate was close to 2 1 by IR measurements and the mole fraction of TMDCB to total bisphenols was 0.5 and 0.4, respectively, by NMR spectroscopy. The Tg values were 1950C and 191bC, respectively.The specific viscosities were 0.8 and 0.9 respectively. Example 8 Molding of Polymers Specimens were molded from the polymers ofComparative Example 2 and Examples 3, 4 100 case only , 6 and 7 60 case only at 3200C and 550 Pa 80 pounds per square inch for 10 minutes. For the mechanical measurements, sheets of about one sixteenth inch 0.158 cm thickness were molded and specimens of the size prescribed by ASTM D628, condition 5, were stamped out.For optical measurements, discs of one eighth inch 0.32 cm thickness and one inch 2.54 cm diameter were molded.Square test plaques of 5 inch 12.70 cm width and oneeighth inch 0.32 cm thickness were also molded from materials prepared as in Example 4, 100 TMDCB case, which example had been scaled up by a factor of 5. The optical values from these plaques were substantially identical to the values in Table I for Example 4 100 TMDCB . Similar 3 inch 7.62 cm square placques were malleable and withstood hammer blows by deforming without shattering.Values for Example 6 were similar to those for the 100 case of Example 4. Solution cast films have also been prepared from each polymer prior to final precipitation from dichloromethane. Each appeared transparent, tough and ductile. Utilizing an Instron Constant Rate of Strain tester and following the conditions of ASTM D638, Condition 5, values for ultimate elongation UE , yield elongation YE , tensile strength, yield strength and initial modulus were determined. Haze indices and yellowness indices were determined by spectrophotometric methods as described in U.S. Patent 4,156,069 including ASTM D 1925.These values are shown in Table I TABLE I PROPERTIES OF MOLDED POLYMERS Poly ester carbonate PolycarbonateExample 3 C2 UE 50 18.7 YE 16 14.5 tensile strength 1.32 9,120 1.64 11,300 MPa psi Yield Strength 1.54 10,630 MPa psi Modulus 44.45 306,580 47.23 325,740 MPa psi Haze Index 20 25 10 15Yellowness Index 19 35 12 18 Transmittance 70 80 85Example 4 100 TMDCB 7 60 TMDCB UE 60 90 80 100 YE 17 20 25 32 tensile strength 62 69 MPa 65 MPa MPa psi 9,000 10,000 9500 Yield Strength 66 76 MPa 69 76 Mpa MPa psi 9,500 11,000 110,000 11,000 MOR 1970 1930 MPa 1897 1959 MPa psi 260,000 280,000 275,000 284,000 Haze Index 15 11Yellowness Index 12 9 Transmittance 83 85 88When tested for impact strength by ASTM D 256, samples 1 8 inch 3.1 mm thick, prepared by the procedure ofExample 4 100 case had notched impact strengths of 1 1.2 ft lb in or 53 63.6 J m and unnotched impact strengths of 21 22 ft lb in or 1113 1116 J m. Example 9 Hydrolysis Resistance of Polymers In order that the hydrolytic stability of the subject polymers can be assessed under realistic service conditions, experiments were conducted on molded sheets.The sheets were molded as described in Example 8 and the sheet thicknesses kept constant at about 0.5 mm so that the weight loss per unit area values could be directly compared. Two sets of data are reported here which represent the most severe conditions studied for aqueous acid and base hydrolysis. The results of aqueous acid hydrolysis for some selected polymers are shown in TableII. In this experiment, the polymer sheets were immersed in refluxing 5N aqueous EC1 for the specified times. The last two entries in the table are for reference purposes.In all cases, there was no detectable weight loss. However, the sample of BPA poly ester carbonate showed a tendency to embrittle during the exposure and eventually broke apart. All other samples retained their original appearance and flexibility. The results for aqueous base hydrolysis for the same sample types are shown in TableIII. For this experiment, the polymer sheets were immersed in 5N aqueous sodium hydroxide at 800C. It should be noted that these conditions of base concentration and temperature are extremely severe for typical polycarbonates and polyesters, as can be seen from the results for both bisphenol A polycarbonate Lexan, a trademark of General Electric and BPA poly ester carbonate . Both polymer samples were totally degraded after 60 hours of exposure degraded to monomers . With respect to weight loss and physical appearance, all polymers derived from TMDCB were unaffected. What is most surprising is that even co poly ester carbonates of TMDCB containing up to 30 mole bisphenol A remained unaffected under these conditions. From the viscosity data in the tables, it can be seen that the TMDCB samples do not show any great degree of chain scission while the two controls show complete degradation in base.
