# Vesicular recording materials.

## Abstract
Vesicular recording materials provided with a sensitised layer comprising as vehicle for the sensitising agent a polyelectrolyte, preferably a quaternised polyelectrolyte such as a quaternised polymer of dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate. The water sensitivity of the preferred polymers may be reduced by copolymerisation with insolubilising comonomers such as itaconic acid.
