# Metal shielded retaining ring.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a retaining ring 10 for sockets which are attached to the shaft of a power driver, such as the pneumatic air tools. The retaining ring 10 is a molded elastomer ring 12 with a diametric, integrally molded pin 14 with a metal sleeve 16 surrounding a portion of the pin. The sockets are provided with a receptacle which receives the shaft end of the driver and flats are provided on the shaft and receptacle to transmit torque. A transverse bore is provided in the shaft end and this receives the pin 14 of the retaining ring 10 . The specific feature is a metal sleeve 16 about the portion of the pin 14 which extends across a boundry interface between the shaft end of the driver and the inside wall of the socket member to provide reinforcement to the pin, resisting shearing and abrasive wear.
