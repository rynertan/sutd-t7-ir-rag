## Description
NOVEL HUMAN INTERFERON yPOLYPEPTIDE Background of the Invention Interferons referred to as IFN hereinafter so far known can be classified into three large groups, i.e. TFN c, IFN ss and IFN y. IFN a is mainly produced by leukocytes, IFN ss by fibroblasts and IFN y by T lymphocotes.These IFNs have been noted as biologically active substances having anti virus activity, activating activitis upon natural killer cells and macrophages, anti tumor activity, and the like However, the conventional methods for obtaining IFNs by isolation from leukocytes and cultured cells cannot provide them sufficiently, Recombinant DNA technology has now been developed to the extent that the mass production of substances which are secreted only in a small amount in cells of higher animals and are hard to isolate such as IFN has become possible by using microorganisms For example, mRNAG ofIFN ss and IFN a were respectively isolated from cells and cDNA complementary to the mRNA was synthesized enzymatlcally, inserted into a suitable plasmid as a double stranded DNA and cloned in Escherichia coli taniguchi, et al. Proc.Jap. Acad., 55 B , 464 469 1979 , Nagata, et al. Nature 294, 316 320 1980 . As for IFN y, there has been a report that it has a stronger cell inhibiting activity than other IFNs based on the experiment using animal cells 3.V Rubin and S L. Gupta Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 77, 5928 5932 1980 .Furthermore, cloning of an IFN y DNA into Escherichia coli and determination of it base sequence were recently reported rP.W. Gray, et al. Mature 295, 503 1982 . The present inventors have made studies in order to provide a large amount of human IFN Y polypeptide using recombinant DNA technology. As a result, it has been found that a novel IFN y DNA with a base sequence different from that of the known IFN y DNA incorporated in a recombinant plasmid is expressible in a microorganism, particularly inEscherichia coliSummary of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel human interleron y polypeptide, a recombinant plasmid wherein aDNA fragment coding for the polypeptide is incorporated1 and a process for producing the human interferon y polypeptide using a microorganism containing the plasmid.

Detailed Description of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a recombinant plasmid wherein a novel IFN y DNA is incorporated, a microorganism containing the plasmid, a process for producing a novel human IFN Y polypeptide using the microorganism and the human IFN y polypeptide per se. Construction of the recombinant plasmid is carried out in the following manner. As the novel human IFN y DNA, sIFNy G4 which was clones by the present inventors is used. Escherichia coli containing pIFNr G4 has been deposited with the AmericanType Culture Collection, U.S.A. under accession numberATCC 39123. The base sequence of the IFN y DNA in pTENy G4 was determined by the method of Maxam and Gilbert Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. 74, 560 1977 and is illustrated in Fig.3. Comparison of the human IFN ycDNA in pIFN gamma G4 and the known IFE ycDNA P.W. Gray, et al. Nature 295, 503 1982 reveals the following. The first base of the triplet coding for the ninth amino acid from the N terminal of the mature human IFN y polypeptide, lysine, in the known cDNA is adenine Gray et al. Nature 295, 503 1982 . On the other hand, as the corresponding base in the pIFN gamma G4cDNA is cytosine, the ninth amino acid from the N terminal of the human IFN y polypeptide encoded by the pIFN gamma G4cDNA is glutamine, and not sine. Therefore, it is apparent that pIFN gamma G4 codes for a novel human IFN y polypeptide. Further, sIrNy G4 has a RsaI restriction site as the 25th base is C. That is, the sequence of the 22nd to 25th bases from 5 terminus of the IiNy DNA in pIFN gamma G4 isGTAC and RsaI cuts the DNA at the position illustrated with the alrow Gr AC . Since none of the known IFN y genes have RsaI site in a DNA region coding for IFN y polypeptide, it is apparent that pIFNy Gd contains a DNA coding for a novel human IFN y polypeptide. Therefore, recombinant plasmids constructed using IFN Y DNA of pIFN alpha . G4 are all new recombinant plasmids. As the plasmid to incorporate IZ DLIA, any plasmid can be used so long as the DNA incorporated therein can be expressed in Escherichia coli. Preferably, 2 plasmid wherein a foreign DNA can be insert downstream from a suitable promoter such as trp promoter or lac promoter and the length of the sequenca between Shine Dalgamo sequenco reterred to asSD sequence hereinafter and the initiation site of translation is adjusted to, for example, 6 18 base pairs is employed. Preferred examples are pKYP 10, pKYP 11 and pKYP 12 which were constructed by the present inventors Japanese Patent Application 213193 81 Japanese Published Ünexamined Patent Application 110600.83 . These expression vectors prepared by the method illustrated in Reference Example 1 centain tryptophan promoters referred to as Ptrp hereinafter . Recombinant plasmid pGC 7 is prepared frcm pKYP 11 and pIFN gamma G4 as illustrated in Fig. 1. That is, pIFN gamma G4 is digested with PuvII and HindIII and the digest is purified by low gelling temperature agarcse gel electrophoresis E. wieslander, Analytical Biochemistry 98, 305 1979 .The resulting fragment of pIFN gamma G4 is inserted inte pKFP 11 at the HindIII BemHI site to obtain pGC 7. Thereafter, as illustrated in Fig. 2, pGC 7 is cut with BstNI and SalI and IFN gamma DNA is purified by Low qellingterperature agarose gel electrophoresis. The IFN gamma D is cloned together with a synthetic DNA in the HindIII Sal site of the expression vector pKYP 10 harboring Ptrp to obtain recombinant plasmid pGKA 2. IFN gamma polypcptide of the present invention is prepared in the following nanner. Escherichia coli K 12 HB101 S.N. Cchen, ot al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 69, 2110 1972 . is transformed with pGKA 2 and an Escharichia coli strain containing pGKA 2 is selected frcm colonies resistant to ampicillin roderred to as ApR hereinarfter . The Escberichie coli serain con tainlng pGKA 2 is cultured in a medium to produce IT y polypeptide in the cells. As the medium, either a synthetic medium or a natural medium can be used as long as it is suitable for the growth of Escherichia coli and the production of IFN y polypeptide. As a carbon source, glucose, fructose, lactose, glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, etc. may be used. As a nitrogen source, NH4Cl, MH4 2SOd, casanino acid, yeast extract, polypeptone, meat extract, bactotryptone, corn steep liquor, etc. may be used. In addition, nutrients such as NH2HPO4, K2HPO4,KH2P04, NaCl, MgSO4, vitamine Bland MgCl2 may be used. Culturing is carried out at pH 5.5 B.5 and at 18 400C with aeration and stirring. After culturing for 5 90 hours, the human IFN y polypeptide is accumulated in cultured cells. The collected cells are treated with lysozyme, disrupted by repeated freezing and melting and subjected to centrifugation. The thus obtained supernatant fluid is subjected to extraction according to a conventicnal method for extraction of polypeptides to recover the polypeptide. Determination of human IFN gamma is carried out according to the method of Armstrong J.A. Armstrong, et al. Appl. Microbiol. 21, 723 725 1971 . Certain specific embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 Insertion of human IFN y DNA into the expression vector pKYP lI In this example, 6 g of plasmid pIFNy G4 3.6 kilobases rererred to as Kb hereinafter was dissolved in 50 p1 of a solution containing 20 mM Tris ECl 7.5 , 10 mM MgCl2, 10 rEL dithiothreitol and 50 mM NaCl.

The digestion reaction solution of the plasmid pXYP 11 was subjected to purification by low gelling teoper ature agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain about 2,5 g o a DNA fragment of about 4.7 Kb containing Ptry. Then, 0.5 g of the DNA fragment of 1.3 Kb con t2lning human IFN y DNA and 1.O g of the DNA fragment of about 4.7 Kb containing Ptrp, which was obtained from the plasmid pKYP 11, were dissolved in 20 pl of a solution contanning 20 taM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dibhio threitol and 500 uM ATP, and 4 units of T4 DNA ligase product of New England Biolabs was added. Ligation reaction was carried out at 40C for 18 hours, and Escherich z coli HB101 was transformed with the obtained recombinant plasmid minture by conventional technigue to obtain an ApR colony. A plasmid, pGC 7 illustrated in Fig. 1 was separated rom the culture broth of the colony. The structure of pGC 7 was confirmed by digestion with HindIll, BamHI, HpaI, SalI, copi and Clal and agarose gel electrophoresis. Escherichia coli strain containing pGC 7 has been deposited with theFermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology referred to as FEP hereinafter asEscherichia coli IGC 7 FERM P 6814 FERM BP 497 .Example 2 Construction of recombinant plasmid pGKA 2 In this example, 6 g of the pGC 7 DNA obtained in Example 1 was dissolved in 50 l of a solution containing 20 mM Tris GCl pH 7.5 . 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 10 mM NaCl, and 12 units of BstNI product of NewEngland Biolabs was added. Reaction was carried out at 600C for 3 hours. Then, 150 mM NaCl and 8 units of SalI were added and digestion reaction was carried out at 370C fcr 3 hours.The reaction solution was again heated at 650C for 5 minutes to inactivate the salI and subjected to purification by low gelling temperature agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain about 0.8 g of a DNA fragment of about 1,125 base pairs referred to as bp hereinafter containing a large portion of the hun an IFN y DNA. Separately, 3 ug of pKYP 10 was dissolved in 40 l of a solution containing 20 mM Tris SCl pH 7.50 10 mMMgCl2, 10 mM dithiothrcitol and 100 mM NaCl. 6 units cech of HindIII and Sell were added and digestion reaction was carried out at 370C for 3 hours.

The N terminal amino acid of the mature humanIFN y polypeptide is cystein Cys . In order to express mature IFN Y DNA, it is necessary to furnish an initiation codon ATG just before the 5 terminal codon TGT Cys and further to adjust the length of the sequence beteeen SD seguence and ATG to a suitable length of 6 1B bp.Therefore, the followingDNA linker was synthesized.

Then, 2 g each of the 18 mer and 15 mer DNAs were dissolved in 20 l of a solution containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM ATP.30 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase product of BoehringerMannheim was added and phosphorylation reaction was carried out at 370C for 60 minutes. Then, 2 g each or phosphorylated 18 mer and 15mer DNAs were mixed and the mixture was heated at 700C for 5 minutes and allowed to stand at room temperature for annealing to obtain the DNA linker having the structure given above 0.4 Lg of the BstNI Sali fragment of 1,125 b obtained above and derived from pGC 7 and 1.0 pg of the DNA ragment of 4.1 Kb obtained by digestion of the expression vector pKYP 10 with HindiIII and SalI were dissolves in 25 l of a solution containing 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 . 6 mMMgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol and 500 pM ATP. About 0.1 pg of the DNA linker mentioned above was added to the mixture, followed by addition of 6 units. of T4DNA ligase. Ligation reaction was carried out at 4 C for 17 hours.Escherichia coli HB101 was transformed using the obtained recombinant plasmid mixture by conventional technique to obtain anR colon. A plasmid pGKA 2 illustrated in Fig. 2 was isolated from the culture broth of the colony. The struc ture of pGKA 2 was confirmed by digestion with EcoRI, Colad,HindIII, BstNI and SalI and agarose gel electrophoresis, it was confirmed by the method of Maxam Gilbert A.M.Maxam, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 74, 560 1977 that the base sequence from the SD sequence AAG to the initaiation codon ATG in the plasmid pGKA 2 is AAGGGTATCGATAAGCTTATG . The human IFN y DNA in pGKA 2 is different from known DNAs in that the DNA has RsaI site and the ninth amino acid of the human IFN y polypeptide encoded by the DMA is glutamine Gln . Further, the synthesized DNA used above is different from the one used by P.W.

Thus, pGKA 2 has a restriction site for BstNI, CCAGG, in the DNA region coding for humanIFN y and this feature also distinguishes pGKA 2 from known plasmids. Furthermore, the length and structure between the SD sequence and ATG are important because of influence on the expression of proteins in Escherichia coli.The base sequence between the SD sequence and ATG in pGKA 2 is apparently different from that in the known recombinant plasmid pIFN y trp48 P.W. Gray, et al. Escherichia coli containing pGKA 2 has ben deposited with the FERM as Escherichia coli TGKA 2 FERMP 6798 FERM BP 496 .Example 3 Production of interferon by Escherichia coliIGC 7 and IGKA 2 Escherichia coli HB101 strains containing the recombinant plasmids pGC 7 and pGKA 2 obtained in Examples 1 and 2 IGC 7 and IGKA 2, respectively were cultured at 37 C for 18 hours in an LG medium consisting of 10 g l tryptone, 5 g l yeast extract, 5 g l NaCl and 2 g l glucose and adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH, Then, 0.2 ml of the culture medium was inoculated in 10 ml of an MCG medium pH 7.2 consisting of 0.6 Na2HPO4, 0.3 KH2PO4, 0.5 NaCI, 0.1 NH4C1, 0.5 glucose, 0.5 casamino acid, 1 mM MgSO4 and 4 g ml vitamin B1. Culturing was carried out at 300C for 4 8 hours.Then, 10 g ml indol acrylic acid referred to as IAA hereinafter which is an inducer of the tryptophan gene was added and culturing was continued for an additional 2 12 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes and washed with 30 mMNaCl and 30 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 buffer solution. The washed cells were suspended in 1 ml of the buffer solution mentioned above and 200 tig of lysozyme and 5 p1 of 0.25 MEDTA ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid were added. The mixture was allowed to stand at 0 C for 30 minutes.Freezing and melting were repeated three times to disrupt the cells. The disrupted cells were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 minutes to obtain a supernatant fluid. The amount of the interferon in the supernatant was determined according to the mete of Armstrong J.A. Armstrong, et al. Appl. Microbiol. 21, 723 725 1971 wherein Sindvis virus was used as a virus and FL cell derived from human amnion cells was used as an animal cell. The result is shown in Table 1.

Chemicals of Nucleic Acids I Tokyo Kagaku Dojin, p. 62 65, 1974 b Cloning of the trp promoter into a plasmid Cloning of the trp operon from Atrp ED phage DNA was carried out in the following manner. That is, 8 g ofAtrp ED DNA was digested at 370C for 2 hours with 16 units of EcoRI and 16 units of HindIII in 20 mI Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 7S mM NaCl, 10 mM MgC12 and 5 mM dithiothreitol. Separately, 1 g of plasmid pbr325 DNA was digested with 2 units ofEcoRI and 2 units of HindIII by the same method as mentioned above final volume 30 l .The reactions were stopped by heating at 65 C for 5 minutes. Then, 15 pL each of the digests were mixed and. 500 M final concentration ATP and 5 units of T4 DNA ligase product of New England Biolabs were added. The mixture was allowed to react at 40C for 18 hours. Escherichia coli C600 SF strain Cameron, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 72, 3416 1975 was transformed with the plasmid mixture by the conventional method S.N. Cohen, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 5, 2110 1972 and transformants resistant to amplcillin ApR , rersistant to tetracycline Tcr and sensitive to chloramphenicol CmS were obtained. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from the trans fo nants of Escherichia coli and cleaved with EcoRI, HindIII and HpaI. One of the plasmid DNAs had the structure illustrated in Fig. 4 A and was named pK LP l. A TaqI cleavage site exists between 4 base pairs downstream from the SD sequence AAGG present downstream from the tryptophan promoter. By taking advantage of this fact, the plasmid pKYP 1 was digested with TagI and EcoRI and the digest was subjected to purification b agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain a 2.6 Kb DNA fragment containing the tryptophan promoter and SD sequence. The 2.6 Kb DNA fragment was cloned in a known vector, pBR322, by the method as illustrated in Fig. 5. That is, 8 g of pBR322 was digested at 45 C for 60 minutes with 2 units of Tal in 100 l of a reaction mixture comprising 10 mM TrisHC1 pH 8.4 , 6 mM MgCl2. 100 mM NaCl and 6 mM 2 mercaptoethanol.After partial digestion with TaqI, the digest was subjected to low gelling temperature agarose gel electrophoresis Lars Wieslander Analytical Biochemistry 98, 305 1979 to obtain a 4.36 Kb purified DNA fragment.About 1.5 g of the DNA fragment was completely digested at 37 C for 3 hours with 3 units of EcoRI, About 1.0 g of a 4.33 Kb DNA fragment was recovered by the same low gelling temperature agarose gel electrophoresis as mentioned above. Then, 12 g of pKYP 1 DNA was partially digested with 3 units of TaqI, the digest was subjected to low gelling temperature agarose gel electrophoresis to obtain about 2 us of a 8.5 Kb purified DNA fragment and the DNA was completely digested with EcoRI by the same procedure as above t obtain about 0.5 ug of a purified 2.6 kb DNA fragment. Then, O. g of the 4.33 Kb DNA of pBR322 and 0.25 g of the 2.6 Kb DNA fragment of pKYP 1 thus obtained were added to 20 l of a reaction solution consisting of 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7.6 , 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM dithiothreitol Then.0.5 mM ATP and 4 units of T4 DNA ligase were added to the mixture and reaction was carried out at 4 C or 18 hours.Escherichia coli C600 SF8 strain was transformed with the recombinant plasmid DNA obtaincd as ahove. The pladmids in the transformant having ApR and Tcr were isolated. The plasmid DNA was digcstrd with 6 restriction endonucleases, EcoRI, Hindu, , ClaI product of Boehringer Mannheim GmbH ,Hpal, Hincil and BamHI to analyze the structure of the plasmid. The plasmid was recognized to have the structure illustrated in Fig. 4 B and was named pKYP 5. c Preparation of a portable promoter from the trp promoter The plasmid vector pKYP 5 mentioned above is applicable as a DNA introducing vector since it has a ClaI site and a HindIII site on the DNA of 1 to 20 base pairs downstream from the SD sequence. However, another Clal site is present in pKYP 5 DNA besides the Clal site immediately after the SD sequence and the fragment with the trp promoter obtained by cutting pKYP 5 DNA with EcoRI andHindIII is a little too large, i.e. 2.65 Kb. For convenience of use, pKYP 5 was improved by the process as illustrated in Fig. 6 to obtain a plasmid having a DNA fragment containing a shorter tryptophan promoter.That is, pKYP 5 DNA was digested with HpaII and HindlIl and the digest was purified to obtain a DNA fragment of about 340 bp. The fragment was inserted into the pBR322 digested with ClaI and HindIII as illustrated in Fig. 6 to obtain pKIP 10.The structure of pKYP 10 was determined by digestion withEcoRI, Clay, HindIII and HpaI and agarose gel electrophoresis. d Connection of two or morn trp promoters In order to construct a plasmid vector having a stronger prcmoter activity, two trp promoters were inserten into the vector. That is, the DNA fragment of about 340 bp containing the trp promoter mentioned in step c above was inserted into the pK tP 10 digested with Clal and HindIII to obtain pKYP l1 as illustrated in Fig. 7 A . The same procedure was repeated to construct pKYP 12 illustrated in Fig. 7 B wherein three trp Promoters were connected at the same orientation. The structure of pKYP 12 was confirmed by digestion with rcoRI, Clal, Hindlil and Hpal.
