# Pre foamed particles of polypropylene base resin.

## Abstract
In pre foamed particles of a propylene base resin obtained by foaming raw particles of the propylene base resin, the relation G₁ G₂ 10 , exists between the content G₁ of matter, which is contained in the pre foamed particles and is insoluble in boiling n heptane, and the content G₂ of matter contained in the raw particles and insoluble in boiling n heptane. The pre foamed particles have excellent moldability and can hence provide with ease low density highly expanded molded articles, which enjoy superb dimensional accuracy, good surface conditions, low percent water absorption, excellent impact and chemical resistance.
