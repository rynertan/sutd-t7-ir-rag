# Disc package.

## Abstract
A disc package for enclosing a record disc and which can be opened to permit the disc to be withdrawn therefrom for in sertion into a disc player comprises a body 3 for accommodat ing the record disc, a cover 4 , and a cover hinge 5 pivotably connecting the cover 4 to the body 3 . The body 3 com prises a first part 3a adjacent to the cover hinge 5 , a second part 3b spaced away from the cover hinge 5 , and a body hinge 16 pivotably connecting the first 3a and second 3b body parts. A central holding member 7 formed on the first body part is engageable within a centre hole formed in the disc when the package is closed around the disc. A peripheral hold ing member 15 is formed on a side of the second body part 3b remote from the body hinge 16 for gripping the outer edge of the disc. The disc package thus can be moved between a closed position wherein it securely grips, encloses and pro tects the disc and an open position wherein the disc is free of the cover 4 , free of the first body part 3a and free of the cen tral holding member 7 and is held only by the second body part 3b , including the peripheral holding member 15 , so that can easily be inserted into a disc player.
