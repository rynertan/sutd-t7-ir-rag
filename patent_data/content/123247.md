# Hypodermic needle disposal system.

## Abstract
A hypodermic needle disposal system includes a portable disposable bottle having a cap assembly movable between an open position permitting used needles to be dropped into the bottle and a closed position locked against reopening. The cap assembly comprises a shim positioned over a bottle opening and a cap ring secured to the bottle in a position overlying the shim and rotatable between the open and closed positions, wherein the shim and cap ring have passages of predeter mined shape formed off center therein. In the open position, these off center passages are aligned to permit dropping of used needles into the bottle which is shaped for controlled needle stacking for optimized numerical capacity. In the closed position, the off center passages are moved out of alignment to close the bottle opening, and locking members on the cap ring and bottle are moved into locked engagement to prevent return cap ring movement toward the open position.
