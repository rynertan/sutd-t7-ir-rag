# MIS semiconductor device.

## Abstract
By the use of high ohmic polycrystalline silicon in MIS elements, it can be achieved that in the poly material a depletion layer is formed which brings about an electric decoupling between the poly gate and the underlying semiconductor body. This effect can be utilized advan tageously in various circuit elements, such as in CCD s in order to obtain a favourable potential distribution in the substrate, in MOS transistors in order to reduce the parasitic capacities and in high voltage devices in order to increase the breakdown voltage at the edge of the field plate resurf .
