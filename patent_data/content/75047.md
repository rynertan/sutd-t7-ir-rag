Title l Substituted phenylthiocarbamyl 3,3 disubstituted formamidines and their production and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. This invention relates to l substituted phenylthiocarbamyl 3,3 disubstituted formamidines, to processes for their production, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in pharmacy. In U.S. 3,959,368 there is disclosed the compoundN,N dimethyl N phenylthiocarbamyl formamidine and its use as an anti inflammatory. We have found that compounds of the following structural formula EMI1.1 wherein n is the integer 1, 2 or 3, preferably 1 or 2 R is alkyl having I to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably methyl alkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably methoxy alkylthio having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, prefer ably methylthio halogen, preferably chlorine nitro acyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, prefer ably acetyl hydroxyl andEMI1.2 wherein R3 and R4 have the same meaning as R1 and R defined below R1 and R2 are the same or different and are alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, more preferably methyl or taken together represent the chain X m CH2 g and forming a ring structure with the nitrogen to which they are bound wherein p is 1, 2 or 3, q is 2 or 3, X represents .0 , S , SO , S02 , r NR3 , R3 is hydrogen or alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably methyl, and m is 0 or 1. The invention therefore provides compounds of the above general formula either as such or in the form of salts thereof, in particular non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts with organic and inorganic acids have activity, showing anti inflammatory, anti oedema and anti hypertensive activity. The compounds of this invention can be used for their intended pharmaceutical purposes either as the free base described above or in the form of suitable organic or inorganic acid salts. A preferred form is the hydrochloric acid salt. The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by reaction of a thiourea II, with a dialkyl acetal III,EMI2.1 in which R, R1, R2 and n are as defined above and R5 represents an alkyl group preferably containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in particular methyl. The compounds may be isolated as the free base or in salt form, as desired. Generally, the above reaction may be carried out by dissolving the two reactants in a solvent such as benzene or toluene, heating the solution at reflux for about 15 minutes, slowly distilling off the solvent alkanol mixture in particular solventmethanol mixture when R5 is methyl, cooling the undistilled solution to room temperature and the recovering of the desired product by filtration.The recovered product can be purified by standard procedures. The following examples illustrate the process for the preparation of the compounds Example I l p methoxyphenylthiocarbamyl 3,3 dimethyl formamidine hydrochlorideEMI3.1 7.3 grams g p methoxyphenylthiourea and 5.0g dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal and 100 milliliters ml benzene were placed in a reaction flask equipped with a distillation head. The mixture was gently refluxed for 15 minutes with the slow removal of the benzene methanol azeotrope mixture through the distillation head. After cooling, the formed 8.0 g precipitate was recovered by filtration with a melting point m.p. 140 142 C. The filtrate was treated with a cold ether HCl mixture and 1.0 g precipitated hydrochloride filtrate was recovered with amp. 1500C with decomposition dec. . The following compounds were prepared by the same procedure using the appropriate starting materials.Compound numbers are assigned to each compound and are used throughout the remainder of the specification.

The first test is for adjuvant arthritis inhibition and the second, an antiedema test, involves the diminution of experimental edema induced in the hind paw of a rat by the injection of carrageenin.Adjuvant ArthritIs Inhibition This test was run according to the test procedure recited byvanArman, G. C., Suss, G. W. and Risley, E. A.,J. Pharmacol.,Exper. Terap., 187 400 413, 1973. The following is a description of the test The hind foot volumes of five Wistar male rats Taiwan strain weighing 130 160 g each were measured by fluid displacement immediately prior to intraplantar administration right hind paw of 0.1 ml of an adjuvant suspension containing 5 milligrams mg Mycobacterium butyricum bacilli suspended in heavy mineral oil. Test compounds were orally administered to the animals for five days beginning the day before injection of the adjuvant.Four hours after the fifth daily drug dose the volume of the right hind paw primary lesion was measured for determination of any acute anti inflammatory effect. Fourteen days after adjuvant inoculation the volume of the uninjected foot was measured secondary lesion for determination of prolonged anti inflammatory effect or imrnlnosuppressant effect. The percent reduction in foot volume was calculated for each hind paw in relation to corresponding control values determined simultaneously. A greater than 30 percent reduction in volume of either paw is considered a significant effect.Reduction of the primary lesion without effect on the secondary lesion denotes acute anti.infla atory activity of short to moderate duration. Reduction of the secondary lesion without effect on the primary lesion suggests interference with the immunological component of polyarthritis disease. Reduction of both lesions suggests anti inflammatory activity of long duration or a mixture of anti inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects as occurs with corticosteroids. Table 2 shows the reduction in edema of the primary and secondary lesions according to the above described test procedure at the indicated rate. Table 2 Percent Reduction in Edema of the Primary and Secondary Lesions at Rate ShownCompound Rate Number mg lc Primary Secondary 1 5 39 35 2 3 100 39 31 4 100 0 0 Not testedAnti edema Anti edema effect was determined according to the test procedure recited by Winter, C.A., Risley, E. A., andNuss, G. W., Proc. Exper. Biol. Med. 111 544 547, 1962.For this test, three male Wistar rats Taiwan strain weighing 100 120 g each are orally dosed with test compound dissolved or suspended in 3 ml of water. One hour later, the plantar surface of the right hind paw was injected with 0.1 ml of a 1 percent suspension of carrigeenan in saline and the left paw was similarly injected with saline only. Three hours after the injection the volume of both hind paw was measured by fluid displacement and the percent decrease in carrigeenan induced swelling volume of carrigeenan injected foot minus saline injected foot was determined by comparison with untreated no test compound animals. Greater than 30 percent inhibition is considered evidence of an anti edema effect. Table 3 shows the reduction in edema in the hind paw of a rat according to the above described test procedure at the rate indicated.

J.Pharmacol., 19 401 408, 1969. For this test, two normotensiveWistar rats Taiwan strain were placed in perspex holders and then placed in a heated chamber at 40 C for 4 6 minutes before treatment. They were maintained there throughout each experiment. Systolic blood pressure was recorded by indirect means employing a tail cuff and pneumatic sensor device applied to the base of the animals tails. The device was coupled to a programmed Narco Biosystems sphygmo nano meter ModelPE 300 , an instrument for measuring blood pressure, and Sanei polygraph. After recording suitably steady blood pressure readings, test drugs were orally administered and blood pressure checked again 2, 4 and 6 hours after drug administration.A mean decrease of more than 10 percent from the pretreatment value at any two consecutive measurement intervals is considered evidence of hypotensive effect. The results of the anti hypertensive test are reported in Table 4.
