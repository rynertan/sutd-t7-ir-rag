# Method of storing characters in a display system.

## Abstract
In a method of storing characters in a display system having a display device with an orthogonai matrix of ad dressable points, each character is represented as a suc cession of strokes each constrained to lie in one of the eight fundamental directions of the matrix and, except for the first stroke, each starting at the end of the previous stroke. Each such stroke is stored in a binary coded form which includes a first binary number direction code defining the angular direction of the stroke, a second binary number length code defining a number of matrix steps from one address able point to the next along the stroke in that direction, and a third binary number move draw code defining the visibil ity of the stroke. In order to facilitate character rotation by any multiple of 45 the direction code defining each funda mental direction corresponds to the addition modulo 2
