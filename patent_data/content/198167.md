# Compression mouldable aromatic polyamide powder.

## Abstract
A new type of aromatic polyamide powder including a large number of fine coalescible particles which have an average size of from 0.1 to 10 µm, which include at least one aromatic amide polymer including 40 to 100 molar of recurring m phenylene isophthalamide units and 0 to 60 molar of at least one other type of additional recurring aromatic amide units, for example, m phenylene tere phthalamide units, and which coalesce with each other to form porous agglomerates having an average size of from 10 to 400 µm and a surface area of from 1 to 20 m² g, and can be compression molded, optionally in mixture with a reinforcing additive, for example, aromatic polyamide fibers having a length of 3 mm or less, at a temperature of 200 to 400 C under a pressure of 300 to 1000 kg cm² for 20 minutes to 5 hours, to produce shaped articles having excellent mechanical properties and appearance.
